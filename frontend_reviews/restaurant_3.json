            "finally a quick spot to grab a darn good sandwich and not spend a fortune.  i truly loved this joint in planet hollywood.  i actually ate here twice in my long weekend.  \n\ni grabbed a breakfast sandwich and a <mark>The Full Montagu </mark> later that day. the bread is divine!!!  the ingredients are all fresh and the service is fast.  i am telling you this is a great find if you need a quick bite.  \n\ni recommend the <mark>Breakfast BLT</mark>, <mark>The Full Montagu </mark> and they also have some yummy sweets to tempt you.  \n\ni loved it!!! i want them to come to colorado. i am dreaming of that bread!", 
            "it saddens me that the east coast doesn't have an earl of sandwich. if it did, you better believe i would take a road trip there to get my grub on. they have super fresh ingredients and make their sandwiches on the spot. the spreads and sauces they use on their sandwiches are also oh so yummy! \n\nduring this past weekend, 10 of my friends and i were in vegas. everyone fell in love with this place instantaneously. luckily this gem of a place was right in our hotel - planet hollywood. out of my 4 day stay there, i only tried this place during the 3rd and 4th day. knowing what i know now, if i could turn back time i would totally eat there for breakfast, lunch, and dinner all 4 days - yes it was that good! \n\ni only tried their hot sandwiches but they only serve salads, soups, and wraps. i tried <mark>The Earl's Club</mark> (roasted turkey, smoked bacon, swiss cheese, lettuce, roma tomato, & sandwich sauce), cannonballs! (meatball, marinara, mozzarella, & parmesan cheese), and the <mark>Breakfast BLT</mark> (bacon, lettuce, roma tomato, & seasoned mayonnaise). all were delicious! \n\nif anyone wants to open up a franchise over on the east coast, particularly nj or ny let me know! lol", 
            "quick, great price and tasty. the <mark>Breakfast BLT</mark> was just made, hot, crispy, and fresh lettuce and tomato. $3.99 it cannot beat.", 
            "i'm not a huge sandwich person... but you wouldn't know it whenever i stay at planet hollywood.  i literally want eos for every meal.  the bread they make and use is so fresh and perfect with every sandwich.  a smaller bun is used for their breakfast sandwiches... but hits the spot, all the same.  \n\ni've had the following: \n- the ultimate <mark>Grilled Cheese</mark>\n- the <mark>Tuna Melt</mark> with swiss (i request for them to add lettuce and tomato... no extra charge!)\n- <mark>The Earl's Club</mark> with turkey and bacon\n- <mark>The Full Montagu </mark> - roast beef and turkey\n- the <mark>Breakfast BLT</mark> (i request to add egg on mine... no extra charge!)\n- the caprese - they definitely don't skimp on the mozzarrella!  \n- the blt \n- the tomato soup\n\neverything.  and i mean everything above is delicious.  however, the <mark>Tuna Melt</mark> is my all time favorite.  $5.99 for a regular sandwich and $3.99 for a breakfast one... can't get a better quality meal for that price on the strip!  \n\nwish i ordered an extra one yesterday to have today while i drool and write this review...", 
            "had their breakfast sandwich....really yummy!!!! <mark>Breakfast BLT</mark> add egg n a lil dijon.....bomb!!!!!! a must try....", 
            "probably one of the better food deals at the heart of the strip. i finally went here after many trips and was not disappointed. the <mark>Chipotle <mark>Chicken Bacon Avocado</mark></mark> was delicious. my friends also thought the <mark>Breakfast BLT</mark> were delicious (and only 3.49!) it'll definitely be on the menu during my future trips"

            "apryl and i found this place on yelp while sitting in our hotel room after a long night of drinking and partying. with our hangovers in desperate need of some meat and bread, we grabbed a cab to planet hollywood and earl of sandwich.\n\ni never thought of a sandwich as something that needed to be \"invented\"... how hard is it to see, bread, meat, bread? \n\nsupposedly, the same family of <mark>The Original 1762 </mark> sandwich inventor owns this sandwich chain... i was unsure until i bit into my <mark>The Full Montagu </mark>. delicious!\n\nthe bread was great. the meat was piled just high enough, not too obnoxious and not too skimpy. the condiments and <mark>Veggie</mark> were just the right touch. definitely worth the cab ride up. \n\nanother bonus: their menu, no matter the sandwich, is all the same price. slightly more expensive than subway and way less expensive than quiznos!", 
            "came here with some family after deciding not to eat at hawaiian tropics right across. i ordered the american (turkey, <mark>Veggie</mark>, cheddar cheese, cranberry sauce, and buttermilk sauce) toasted on a nice ciabatta like bun.  it was really good and had a nice balance of flavor with the cranberries and sauce.\neveryone else got the meatball sandwich and they really enjoyed it one of my uncles got the jerk chicken which he didn't really like because he said the soup tasted better. the prices are right for $6.43 a sandwhich. overall id come here again to try another good sammie.", 
            "okay super delicious tuna sandwich! it doesnt come with any <mark>Veggie</mark> though and as a veggie lover i like to add <mark>Tomato</mark> and lettuce and then it might possibly be the best tuna sandwich ever!\n\nfirst time coming here i tried the earl club as well but i thought it was dry. my friend said the blt was good too but i cant ever think about anything but the tuna! get the tuna. you wont be disappointed.", 
            "crazy to think that of all the great places to eat in vegas--i chose earl of sandwich--but it was amazing.  the sandwich was just right, super juicy, and not overflowing with extra <mark>Veggie</mark> and sauce that i hate.", 
            "tasty sandwiches at all hours of the day?! yes please. in vegas, good food at an affordable price is hard to come by. skip the 24 hour diners in your hotel, with the greasy fare and slow service. this counter style shop is super efficient, cheap, and gooooooood. \n\nstopped by hot and tired around lunch time, only to find a long line... i was tired and hungry, so i figured it'd be better to wait than venture back into the 100 degree heat for something else. surprisingly, the line moved quickly. i also appreciate that they give you a buzzer when your food is ready so that there isn't a crowd waiting near the pick up counter. food came quickly, also a big bonus. i got <mark>The Earl's Club</mark> sandwich. the sandwich was hot and bread freshly toasted, the <mark>Veggie</mark> were fresh, and the special \"sandwich sauce\" was tasty and they applied a nice amount (not too much to over power and soggy the sandwich, and enough so i could taste it).\n\nwould highly recommend!!", 
            "i guess this is what you consider \"cheap\" food on the strip. the line was long but it moves along efficiently. their sandwiches are delicious and warm, even in the hot weather. the earl club was amazing. there was a really strong bacon flavor and the roasted turkey went well with the melted swiss cheese. the caribbean jerk chicken sandwich was also very good. i liked the sauce alot. the <mark>Veggie</mark> were fresh. the in-house jalapeno chips were good and decently priced. i'll definitely come back if i'm ever in vegas.", 
            "to my dearest earl,\n\nyou have swept me away with your delectable mouth watering sandwiches.  the line certainly didn't discourage me from trying your sandwiches; actually the line went by pretty fast.  as i stood there struggling with what i wanted to order, after much debate, i decided on <mark>The Full Montagu </mark>...and it was simply amazing.  earl, you put quizno's to shame in a heart beat.  it was packed with roast beef, turkey, and <mark>Veggie</mark>.  i will say it again...it was ahhhmazing in every bite. \n\nyou have and will become one of many of my food love affairs with every vegas visit.\n\nlove,\ncrystal n.", 
            "there really isn't anything more to say that hasn't already been said.   heading to vegas for labor day weekend!  woo hoo!  party party?  well, yes that's a given.  but is it sad that one of the stops i am looking forward to making is the earl of sandwich?  24 hours a day 7 days a week of yummy sandwich goodness!\n\nbeen here at least four times and it has been consistently good every time.  and soo soo soo soo cheap!  can't believe i'm eating on the las vegas strip type of cheap!  my favorites - <mark>The Original 1762 </mark> 1762 (soo much roast beef), <mark>The Full Montagu </mark>, and the caribbean jerk chicken. i'm sure anything you order here will be great - but those are my favorites.  not just good at 4am when you're drunk, stumbling through the deserted miracle mile shops of ph (which, by the way-resembles some sort of zombie apocalypse 4am!) and still good at 5pm the next day before a night of drinking.  \n\nthe key is the quality of the bread, the meat, and sauces.  the competition needs to take a page out of earl of sandwich's playbook - quality over quantity.  generous portions of meat but not too much meat to overdo it. not like those other sandwich shops that just serve you the side of an animal piled up between two small slices of bread.  . earl of sandwich serves the perfect amounts of meat, sauce and <mark>Veggie</mark>.\n\nthe process is so streamline - the line may seem long but they have fulfillment down to a science so it moves fast.  place your order, listen for your number - done!\n\na word of advice - if you are a big eater - order two sandwiches.  i'm not saying they're small by any means - but they are soo good and go down so easily - you'll be craving another.  trust me.", 
            "earl of sandwich is located in the planet hollywood hotel. all the sandwiches are $5.99 (which is a steal in vegas). think quizno's but 100 times better in flavor and in quality. \n\nearl of sandwich offers several specialty sandwiches, all toasted on their famous artisan bread. when i first approached earl of sandwich, the line was wrapped around the corner, and i cringed, thinking i would have to wait an eternity before i could get my hands on one of their tasty sandwiches. \n\nto my surprise, the line went by quite quickly, and we got our food order within 10 minutes. not too shabby, especially with the mob that was surrounding the place.  \n\nhighlights:\n\nclub: turkey, bacon, lettuce tomato, sandwich sauce. subbed out sauce for their house mustard which is a mix of dijon and honey mustard. the sandwich was just plain good. the bacon was not too fatty and it added the perfect smokiness to the turkey. the crunch of the bread mixed with the meat and <mark>Veggie</mark> was a pure delight! this was my favorite sandwich of the day. \n\nmontagu: turkey, roast beef, lettuce, tomato, house mustard. i liked this sandwich too. there wasn't an overwhelming amount of meat, and again it all kind of worked together. \n\nitalian: this was also very good. typically, italian sandwiches (i.e. grinders) are way too salty for me because of all the different types of meat (which all tend to be on the salty side) to my surprise, the warm sandwich really hit the spot for me without making me run for a glass of water to wash down all the sodium. \n\nham egg and cheddar breakfast sandwich- i thought this breakfast sandwich was just ok. i definitely think that the other specialty sandwiches are better deal in price and in flavor. it was kinda bland, and i needed my special hot sauce to give it a zing. ($3.99)\n\nearl of sandwich was so good, that i went there twice in one visit (especially with all the good places vegas has to offer). it's definitely a good alternative if you're trying to stay on budget, without sacrificing flavor. \n\nhighly recommended!", 
            "i like the fact that it's open 24 hours.  the sandwiches are par, but i can do this at home and so can you.  the bread is decent so you got that earl.  if i were to open this chain in la, it would fail.  to generic and not enough <mark>Veggie</mark>....", 
            "for those who are skeptical and think this place is over yelped.. it's not!\n\nthis is a sandwich spot unlike no other. they have such a great system in place where you \n1. order your sandwich.. \n2. then proceed to part of 2 of the line where you grab your sides and drinks\n3. pay (5.99 for a sandwich.. awesomeness!)\n4. recieve a buzzer so you can find a table and get your drinks. \nin about 10-15 minutes.. your custom crafted sandwich is ready.\n5. gorge your face with the yummiest thing between two slices of bready greatness.\ni got to experience the full montegue and jerk chicken hot sandwiches. the sandwich fillings were not so robust.. more like they blended together so beautifully with the baked to order bread, the cheesy gooiness, and the fresh meats and  <mark>Veggie</mark>. \nit came perfectly gift wrapped in aluminum and had a little sticker of earl that named each sandwich by type.. i felt like it was christmas.. yup! santa earl..\nso whenever vegas is a calling.. make sure you pay sir earl a visit!\n\n**if you don't wanna deal with ph's parking.. park over at mirage and cross the street.. easy structure to get in and out of!",

            "uh-may-zing!  i don't usually use this word to define my food but in this case, i can't see anything else more fit- the sandwiches are devine!  i am a big fan of sandwiches so you can probably argue that i would enjoy any good meat and <mark>Veggie</mark> between two slices of properly mayo-ed bread.  but this is on a whole other level.\n\nwe ordered a jamaican jerk chicken sandwich and a holiday sandwich.  the holiday sandwich was a thanksgiving special- with turkey, stuffing, cranberry sauce, gravy.  omg thanksgiving in a sandwich!!!!!!  and the jerk chicken was spicy slices of chicken with a lot of peppers.  it was just all incredibly juicy and flavorful.  even though there were a lot of people, the line moves pretty quickly and your sandwiches is done in less than 10 mins.  \n\nit is open 24 hours and inside planet hollywood, with plenty of extra options like <mark>Brownie Bites</mark>, chips, cookies, beers, frozen lemonade, salads, and so on.  highly recommended to fellow sandwich lovers, usual sandwich haters (like my bf- but he loved this!), and just late night gamblers in general.  a good, cheap place to catch a bite to eat!", 
            "after reading all the great reviews for this place,  i had to check it out.  unfortunately, i was not impressed by this place as everyone else was.  \n\nall their sandwiches are 6\" subs that are cut in half, filled with their meats, toasted, and then topped with <mark>Veggie</mark>.  coming from texas, they are similar to which-wich or potbelly's, but with less options.\n\ni went with <mark>The Earl's Club</mark> sandwich which consisted of turkey, bacon, lettuce, and tomato.  the sandwich was bland and did not have much flavor.  i didn't even notice that there was bacon in my sandwich. \n\ni guess i have just been spoiled by similar businesses that are located in other states.  the big advantage of this place is that it is located in an excellent location on the strip, is open 24 hours a day, and the prices are reasonable considering where it is located.", 
            "conveniently located in planet hollywood, right by the entrance to the miracle mile shops and close enough to the casino. i enjoyed <mark>The Original 1762 </mark> 1762. the hot sandwich didn't have much (roast beef, cheddar cheese, and horseradish sauce with no <mark>Veggie</mark>), but it was perfect the way it was. juicy roast beef that wasn't overcooked with the cheese melted right on top. their coffee is quite good too. the place is open 24 hours, so it's a great place to pick up a meal at any time of day. free wi-fi too!",

            "never would i have imagined this place being so popular on yelp!  went here for our last meal in vegas after seeing all the positive reviews from yelp friends!\n\ni got the caprese sandwich, since i'm a vegetarian.  you really can't mess up a caprese sandwich.  or even make it any better... until you have earl of sandwich!  they made me an excellent caprese sandwich!\n\nit's been a while since i went, but i remember the bread being perfectly toasted... not too soft and not crunchy where it's tearing up my gums.  it was a perfect combination of a crispy outside and warm soft fluffy bready-insides.  then the buffalo mozzarella was so fresh, as were all the <mark>Veggie</mark> that came inside my sandwich.  most enjoyable caprese sandwich ever!\n\nmy fiance got a meatball sandwich, but he recalls it being just okay.  but after talking to so many people who rave about earl of sandwich, he's hyped up to go back and try a different sandwich!", 
            "first and foremost, thank you to yelpers michelle \"shell\" b. and bubba n. for suggesting this place to me!\n\nmy brothers, friend, and i went for our first lunch in vegas. after a ridiculously laborious trip from downtown to planet hollywood, we were there. another few minutes were spent navigating the maze that is ph to the earl of sandwich, and alas it was time for lunch!\nthe line itself was scary, but went by in a flash. a line that could have easily taken 45 minutes took maybe ten. the girl taking our orders was nice, but not much in the way of conversation or greeting. she did, however, keep that line moving.\nthe sandwich selection was plentiful, but not so much that it was overwhelming. there were a few treats to look at as the line made it's way down the counter to the registers (chips, fruit, drinks, cookies, etc.).\ni went with the caribbean jerk chicken sandwich. it was delicious! my only gripe was that the jerk sauce wasn't as sweet of as spicy as i would have like, but it will not stop me from ordering it again. the bell peppers and banana peppers were excellent!\nmy brother and my friend each got the hawaiian and holy crap was it good! ham, barbeque sauce, and pineapple make this sandwich shine, it was definitely the best of them all.\nmy other brother got <mark>The Full Montagu </mark> and it was the least favored. all in all, it was a good sandwich. it had roast beef, turkey, cheddar, swiss, and <mark>Veggie</mark>. our problem with this one was that it was a typical sandwich. compared to similar sandwiches from other restaurants, this one is far better but there was nothing about this one that stuck out or made it special like the other sandwiches.\n\ni'm glad i found this place, i'll definitely be back!!!", 
            "this place is overly hyped especially if you are friends with vegas fiends! lol\n\ni tried this on my recently trip to vegas and i have to say that i have had better. and way better on both my wallet and waist. easy to say that nothing comes cheap in vegas except for those lovely free drinks. but good food is hard on your wallet and even harder to find. since i was staying at planet hollywood westgate, i have actually been at earl's a total of 5 times for this trip. and each time had me wishing that they would add some more <mark>Veggie</mark> to my bad vodka soaked diet. the bread was sooo delicious but full of butter and grease. i found out that you can actually ask for <mark>Veggie</mark> or extras in it without a charge! i wish i knew that earlier!! :( but nonetheless it is a pretty good deal for being in vegas and the portions are not too bad. if you're a girl you will be full off of $7 and for a guy.. well it sucks to be you in vegas anyhow :(",

            "i think i'm one of the few people who just doesn't care for earls, and thats probably considering that i'm vegetarian, and they have only 2 sandwich options.  \n\ni've been here plenty of times and i loved their vegetarian sandwich that was stuffed with feta cheese, <mark>Veggie</mark>, balsamic etc.  it was delicious! however, i remember going back and they had taken the sandwich off the menu. i was bummed and when i asked them for a different option, they said the only sandwich they had was the caprese.  i wasn't feeling it, and i asked if they would mind making me something else, they said they couldn't.  that makes no sense. i just wanted a sandwich stuffed with <mark>Veggie</mark>, cheese, etc. but they said that wasn't allowed.  i was so furious, considering i waited in such a long line and i was starving. \n\ncoming here this past weekend.  i saw that they added another veggie option to their menu, i was stoked to try it, however when i arrived to the front of the line, the cashier said they had run out.  when i asked if they could make me something else, they once again denied this request.  \n\ni suggest they step up their service & offer more vegetarian options. \n\nbtw the two stars are for their sandwich bread. its just so good.", 
            "this place is alright.  i think my friends hyped up this place too much.  i got the <mark>Chipotle <mark>Chicken Bacon Avocado</mark></mark> sandwich.  tastes like what it is.  i think the thing that is special about this place is probably that they tosat their sandwiches.  comes out to look like a brick shaped sandwich.  the sandwich came out warm and crisp.  i was so hungry that i ate that sandwich super fast.  i didn't think it was that extraordinary.  i've had better sandwiches.  i felt like for the price i was paying there should have been more stuff in it.  it was a bit too plain for me.  i wish it had more <mark>Veggie</mark> or something it in.  i felt like the sandwich was incomplete.  \n\ni would come back if i needed to grab something fast to eat.  i rather grab something else that vegas has to offer.  try it if you never had it though!  not bad!", 
            "my goodness - the tomato soup here leaving you dreaming for a giant bowl of it every day for lunch. yum! \n\nthe line here can be long or short depending on when you come, but they manage to move the queue rather quickly so you can place your order and be seated quickly. the service has always been prompt here which is why i enjoy coming here - to get in and out and enjoy the rest of vegas. \n\nthe food here can be hit or miss depending on what you order. i ordered the special - caribbean jerk chicken sandwich....major bust. where did all the <mark>Veggie</mark> go for a sandwich?! however, the veggie sandwich here is just solid. i actually prefer that over the chicken subs any day! the breakfast sandwiches are super yum and if you like a nice kick to it, add a few splashes of tabasco and boom - culinary creation upgraded! but whatever you decide to order - dont forget to get a side of the tomato soup. it'll rock your socks off.", 
            "yes baby!!!!\nmy new fav sandwich spot!\ni ordered <mark>The Original 1762 </mark> with chicken tortilla soup! \nmeat was juicy and cheese was cheesy!\nthe cashier even gave me a drink while i waited, due to the wait! classy!! :)\nthe soup was perfected with the right amounts of chicken, spices and <mark>Veggie</mark>!\ni will be back!!!\nmy con is the bread is a little too thick for my liking, but delish!\nalso, i hate that i have to go to ph just to get my sandwich!", 
            "vegas on a budget? so you're in vegas and maybe you've had a little too much to drink or you've lost a good amount of money at the slots or the tables? basically... if you're low on money or you're just hangry, satisfy your cravings at earl's! it's a great option for a quick bite and to get some carbs and nutrients before taking on another night/or even day!\n\nnever disappointed with my sandwiches and after eating every last bit of it, always tempted to order another because bread is awesome and adding meats, cheeses, and <mark>Veggie</mark> just makes it even better.\n\noverall? affordable, quick, casual, & delicious - hence the four stars because if you're not down to buffet with the rest of them, this is one of your best options!", 
            "was recommended by a friend to try this place while vacationing in vegas. i was warned by my friend about crazy lineups so i opted for monday afternoon around 2:30pm and there were no lineups! \n\ni actually visited two locations for earls. the location inside planet hollywood as well as the one inside caesars palace - will review both. \n\nfor this location here, i ordered <mark>The Full Montagu </mark> while my boyfriend had the earls club. both tasted pretty similar to me and for the price i thought it was pretty good for the value. \n\nfor my second visit, i ordered the veggie sandwich and it was delicious! i liked this one alot more. it had lettuce, avocado and bunch of other <mark>Veggie</mark> smothered in i believe a pesto sauce - super filling and satisfied. would definitely go back!", 
            "perfect sandwich for brunch, a midnight snack, or anytime while you are in vegas!\n\ni usually get the <mark>Chipotle <mark>Chicken Bacon Avocado</mark></mark> sandwich only because it's the only sandwich that has avocado in it. my boyfriend got the <mark>Tuna Melt</mark> sandwich which was pretty good but it could use some <mark>Veggie</mark>. it only had tuna and cheese. \n\nthis place gets packed- expect a small line most of the time but it is very well organized with someone first taking your order, then going down the line to pay at the next window, then waiting about 5 minutes for your food. they have an area to sit and enjoy your food as well.", 
            "the food was not bad. i enjoyed eating the salad and it seemed like some time was put into the making of it. it was packed with meat, <mark>Veggie</mark>, etc. i can taste the flavor, and it looked presentable. so for some quick food with decent prices and some good flavor, i do recommend this place.\n\nif you are on a budget, this is the place!"

(meatballs, marinara, mozzarella & parmesan cheese), which was a little salty, but still delish when hot. then again, meatball sandwiches were never my thing.\n\nif like me, you need your sandwich with a side of soup, this place offers a few soups to choose from. i had the broccoli and cheese soup, which comes with oyster crackers if you ask for them. it had nice bite-sized chunks of broccoli and wasn't too thick.\n\nto finish it off, we tried the ice cream sandwich made with ghirardelli chocolate. the top layer of brownie was good, but the ice cream wasn't creamy enough and the bottom layer was cake, which felt kind of cheap.\n\nthe best part about it is that the prices are totally reasonable and comparable to national sandwich chains. the sandwiches are all $5.95 and soups $2.95. and don't think you're going to get cheated with a shot glass of soup. it was an honest bowl-sized portion, and definitely more than what you'd get at the other chains. in addition, it offers a variety of <mark>Fruit Cup</mark>, parfaits, <mark>Potato Salad</mark>, cookies, chips and the like. you can have a full meal for under $10 in vegas. unheard of!",

            "this place is a 3.5 on the chart for me.  \n\nlocated inside of planet hollywood and it's open 24 hours.  feel free to come here anytime you like the sandwiches are fresh at all times.  \n\nwe ordered <mark>The Original 1762 </mark>, <mark>The Full Montagu </mark>, <mark>Hawaiian BBQ</mark>, and <mark>The Earl's Club</mark>. i got to try a bit of all of those sandwiches except for the earl's.  \ntaste is good but if i had to choose i would pick the <mark>Hawaiian BBQ</mark>. chicken, ham, cheese, pineapple and bbq sauce goes really well together.  \n\nthe price for the sandwich is fairly priced but it's not that big of a sandwich.  probably the size of a 6 inch sub.  they don't put a lot of meat inside as well.  it's more bread than meat for sure.  some bites had nothing but bread.  \n\ndefinitely a good spot to hit up after <mark>The Earl's Club</mark> though, using the bread to soak up all the alcohol and hopefully you won't puke it all out after.", 
            "my favorite place to eat when i'm tired of the food courts on the strip.\ni've only tried <mark>The Earl's Club</mark> sandwich (which is excellent btw), but i hope to try the other ones next time i'm in vegas. the bread is toasted perfectly and there is a nice variety of hot sandwiches.", 
            "one of the best sandwich shops i've ever been to!\n\nthank you, five hundy by midnight, for recommending this place at the planet hollywood casino!  they are either open late or 24 hrs, because we arrived after 2am and were able to order a sandwich.\n\ni started with <mark>The Earl's Club</mark> and tried the <mark>All American</mark> on the 2nd visit - both awesome, but <mark>The Earl's Club</mark> was better.\n\nmy husband started with the blt and tried the <mark>Hawaiian BBQ</mark> on the 2nd visit - both awesome, but he liked the blt better.\n\nmy other friend is in love with <mark>The Full Montagu </mark> and thought the soup was tasty as well.\n\ntheir unique brick-shaped tasty bread and their sandwich sauces make this place so good that now that we've returned home from vegas, we have looked up all other earl of sandwich locations and will make a special stop next time we go to one of those cities.,", 
            "this place is as good as it gets.  we stayed in vegas ph for 3days and 2nights and we must ate at earl's like 4 times.  \n\nfirst this place is open 24/7, so both nights after <mark>The Earl's Club</mark> in 5am we stopped by this place and got some sandwiches too good.  besides being open 24/7, the sandwiches are sooo good specially <mark>The Full Montagu </mark> sandwich.  that was the only one i tried, and it was so good that i didn't bother to try something else.  why was it soo good?  the bread was fresh, the meats were hot, and the tease was good overall.  \n\nohh the sandwich is only $6, it is way cheap for being in vegas.  oh and btw did i mention that the sandwiches are good as hell?", 
            "$5.99 for a great sandwich is such a steal in vegas. i can't believe of all my vegas trips, i've never come to aladdin/ph. with over 300 reviews, i'm so surprised no one's told me to come here before!\n\nwith the new city center sky bridges connecting aria to the ph, it's so convenient to walk across the street for a bite. its right at the entrance of ph and you can't miss it. there is plenty of seating around after you order at the counter. every sandwich is baked to order. i had <mark>The Earl's Club</mark> (roasted turkey, smoked bacon, swiss cheese, lettuce, roma tomato & sandwich sauce) which was awesome although \"sandwich sauce\" sounded questionable haha. my friend had the caribbean jerk chicken (grilled chicken, roasted red & banana peppers & spicy jerk sauce) which unfortunately wasn't very flavorful. <mark>The Full Montagu </mark> (roasted beef, turkey, swiss & cheddar cheese, lettuce, roma tomato & earl's mustard) is good too.\n\ni'd come back in a heartbeat!",

(is he really?)\n\nat first, i was getting frustrated trying to find this place in  planet hollywood, but it was definitely worth the search. it's cheap, filling, and extremely good!\n\ni went to las vegas this past month and tried earl of sandwich for my very first time. i can't believe i was missing out on such an amazing sandwich! \n\nbefore i thought, \"it's just a sandwich\", i mean  how good can a sandwich possibly get? this, my dear, is as good as it gets. i'm sure this place steals pieces of heaven to put in their sandwich. \n\ni've only gone here twice throughout the duration of my stay in vegas and the sandwiches i tried were <mark>The Earl's Club</mark> and <mark>The Full Montagu </mark>. these are both winners in my book. \n\ni don't know how they do it but they put just the right amount of everything in these sandwiches. at first i thought the meat makes the sandwich or maybe a secret sauce but now i'm positive it's all in the bread. i may be mistaken but i think i had read somewhere that they don't bake the bread until you order it. is it possible to bake bread that quickly? \n\nwhatever their secret is, it definitely works and is well worth any wait you may experience. (i didn't have to wait long but i've heard the lines get pretty long).",

            "go here. good food for cheap. <mark>The Earl's Club</mark> and tuna are grand. you can bring your gal--the food is good enough to keep her from thinking you're being cheap. that's worth five stars.",

            "what fascinates my boyfriend the most about this is that it seems to be owned by descendants of the actual earl of sandwich, meaning that they, of all people, should know sandwiches. this always leads me to question how hard it really is to stick meat in bread and eat it... i mean, could humanity really have gone that long before coming up with such an idea? or is it that this guy, earl of sandwich, just proclaimed it first? \n\nanyway, i digress...\n\nthe kicker here is the bread- baked fresh and run through an oven with the toppings so that a crusty exterior and gooey interior can create magic in your first bite. \n\ni can always go for more meat and cheese in any sandwich, but for the very fair price of $5.99 per sandwich, i'm not complaining. so far, i've sampled <mark>The Full Montagu </mark> (#1 for me), <mark>The Original 1762 </mark> (#1 also for me, it's a tie), <mark>The Earl's Club</mark> (#3 for me), the italian (#4 for me) and the hawaiian (#5, but this will fall quickly as i sample the others- the sauce is too sweet for me). \n\nif you ever get the chance, order a salad. the croutons kick serious ass. \n\nthe lines can get long, but the staff runs through it quickly. you order from the sandwich/salad/wrap/soup menu first and are given a buzzer. from there you walk through a gauntlet of temptation- parfaits, <mark>Potato Salad</mark>, coleslaw, beer and wine, and a wall of desserts- before you reach the cashier and pay for your meal and anything you picked up on the way. when you hot food is ready, you're buzzed. i usually don't sit in my seat for more than three minutes before i get the buzzer of joy. \n\nduring my second visit, one register was down so the line was slow moving, but that actually caused my sandwich to be ready right when i paid- not so bad in the end!",

            "i make sure i hit earl of sandwich up at least once per vegas trip. \n\ni usually order <mark>The Earl's Club</mark> or <mark>The Full Montagu </mark>, but i'm going to go ahead and bet that the rest of the sandwiches on their menu are just as good. i'm foaming at the mouth just thinking about them. the ingredients are fresh. the bread is toasted to perfection. the sandwiches aren't all greased out so they feel relatively healthy to eat and you don't feel gross afterwards. sometimes i'll get a side of broccoli cheese soup w/ my meal. the soup is really good, but nothing special.\n\nthere's a long line? not uncommon. just shut your mouth and get in line. this is the perfect to place to go after a long night of drinking and dancing at <mark>The Earl's Club</mark>.", 
            "i agree with other yelpers in regretting not coming here more often. this is a very affordable place to eat in vegas and is very delicious! my party loved it so much we came back the very next day as our last meal in vegas.\n\nlocation/parking: located inside the planet hollywood casino right across from the sports bar.\n\nseating/wait: quick moving line if you want to order. better to send someone from your party to find a table during busy times.\n\nservice: order over the counter. sit and enjoy!\n\nfood:\n-tomato soup with croutons (i asked for it on the side). this is hands down my favorite tomato soup every. eww!!! tomato soup. no really. i usually don't order tomato soup but i've ordered this every time i've been here. i suggest asking for croutons on the side. otherwise, they come included in the soup and it may be soggy by the time you find a spot to sit.\n-<mark>Potato Salad</mark> cup from fridge: it's a 2 star. it's as if you got <mark>Potato Salad</mark> from a super market.\n-sugar cookie: pretty good/ok.\n-brownie creme (looks like oreo whoopee): i thought it was ok.\n-<mark>The Earl's Club</mark> sandwich: amazing! club sandwiches are usually all the same but it very god here.\n-caribbean jerk chick sandwich: delicious.\ncan't remember what the other 2 sandwiches were but all delicious.\n\nthis place is so good. \"earl\" of sandwiches is quite demeaning. it should be at least a duke of sandwiches.", 
            "came in here at 3 am to get a snack after <mark>The Earl's Club</mark>, really like the sandwich here. they are tasty and good for the wallet better than togos, quiznos and subway.  it is located in planet hollywood inside the casino at the front of starbucks. it is open 24 hours and the prices are stupid affordable. if you are saving some money on food because you want to spend your money on casinos, clubs, or whatever the heck your trying to do in vegas.", 
            "ate here twice and was never disappointed. maybe because i got the same sandwich...but they were both good nonetheless! the bread was perfectly toasted and buttery. mmmmm! i got <mark>The Earl's Club</mark> and it was the best club i've ever had. i want some now! you know what else? they are open 24 hours! so grab a fat tuesday and hop over to earls. you won't be dissapointed.", 
            "okay. so here's the deal.\n\nyou go to a few different sandwich shops on different days to pick up some goods to indulge your nom nom feeling. say you like the blt or <mark>The Earl's Club</mark> and that's what you get every time, regardless.  you choose these because you focus on the what's being sandwiched between the two pieces of bread.  the bread is seriously just some edible cushion to keep your hands from getting messy from eating the goodness of what's inside the sandwich.  it's the law of sandwich bread.\n\nyou come in earl of sandwich and that law is completely broken. you can get any sandwich, and despite which one you get, it will be a winner.  the highlight of each sandwich is the bread. it's perfectly toasted on the outside and warm and fluffy in the inside. it truly disgusts me to even think about how beautiful sandwich bread could be. a dinky picture and even this review can barely describe the wonders of their bread. you're probably thinking, \"damn, this girl is seriously trippin' about the bread\", and you know what? yeah, i am. it's seriously that good. okay, thats enough on bread.\n\n<mark>The Full Montagu </mark> is very delicious and the roast beef was tender.\n\n<mark>The Earl's Club</mark> tasted so fresh and the bacon gave it a nice crunch.\n\nthe carribean jerk is a must have if you want loads of flavor in your sandwich.\n\ni've also tried some of their wonderfully made soups:\n\ntomato soup- was thick, creamy, and had croutons in it. my boyfriend ordered the food while i was away in one of the stores, and the soup was sitting for awhile. i came back, all sad faced, because the croutons were going to be soggy.... or atleast that's what i thought. it was 100% crunchy and the soup was at a perfect <mark>Hot Tea</mark>. if you like tomato soup, it's a must have.\n\nbroccoli cheese soup- was also very creamy and flavorful. it was thick and chunky, but not too thick where it had the consistency of porridge ( a red flag for me to send it away ). \n\nexpect to stand in a line during hungry hours; you get a pager when your food is ready. trust me, its worth the wait! the sandwiches are your ordinary sandwich prices and soups are also well priced. i honestly believe it tastes like a million bucks though.... nothing compares to these sandwiches.\n\none of the best parts is, is that my hotel was a 3 minute walking distance from planet hollywood ( @ the marriot ) and i literally could walk here any part of the day/night ( 24-hour service!!!! ) to grab a nomster sandwich.\n\ni'm seriously coming here every time i visit vegas!\n\nps--\nbeware of staring at random people in that area, you may get punched to the face and knocked down to the ground. my friend did, atleast. hahahahahha. sucks.", 
            "at our recent vegas trip, we stayed at the ph westgate towers and this joint was situated nicely in the hotel.  it will now be a staple for us every time we're in need of a good sandwich.  we tried <mark>The Earl's Club</mark> and <mark>The Full Montagu </mark> (both hot).  i don't know what they put in their sandwiches...maybe crack (j/k)??  the sandwiches were awesomely delicious!  my only complaint is that i wished they were bigger!", 
            "one of the best sandwiches i've ever had! i love that there still exists a place on the strip to get cheap, quality food. all of their sandwiches and salads are $5.99 and packed with quality and flavor. best of all, they're open 24 hours! luckily for me, i stayed in the westgate towers at planet hollywood so we were only a stone's throw away from earl's. among my group of friends, i bet we hit this place up at least 5 times a day. my favorite is <mark>The Earl's Club</mark> sandwich. the bread, ingredients, and special sandwich sauce they put in all meld together perfectly. their <mark><mark>Chicken Caesar</mark></mark> salad is also delicious (croutons were on the salty side but no matter). yes, the line can get long but it goes by really fast. clubs, gambling, and other shenanigans are fun but earl's is definitely gonna be my reason for returning to vegas.", 
            "i loved it the first time and intended to give this place 5 stars since it was good and i ate it two days in a row. this time i feel like there was a lack in quality for the sandwich. i ordered 4 <mark>The Earl's Club</mark> sandwiches, and none of them had lettuce -nada! it also had too much bacon, so the sandwich was wayyy too salty. eh i am officially sick of this place. i will not crave for it next time.", 
            "i think i eat here at least 3 times during every vegas trip. it's especially helpful that they are open 24 hours which is perfect for drunk munchies at 3..4...5 am. \n\nlove the toasted soft bread and how the sandwiches are consistent. i personally like the classic <mark>The Earl's Club</mark> but i haven't tried a bite of one yet that wasn't good.\n\nbeware that some pools don't let you bring your leftover food inside! so instead of sacrificing half of your sandwich to the trash you better eat the whole thing asap.", 
            "delicious!! its awesome that you can order food from a deli in a vegas hotel and the sandwiches start from $5.99... their sandwiches are yummmy too!! if you're staying at the hotel, you don't need to go anywhere else, pick up a sandwich and bring it up to your room to enjoy...\n\nthis place is open 24 hours and will not disappoint you.. other delis or restaurants around here will charge you over $10, where this place you'll pay under $8 for a good sandwich... \n\nmy group ordered <mark>The Earl's Club</mark>, hawaiian, roast beef, and the mozzarella sandwiches and we were very pleased with all our options.. they did not disappoint us at all.. this is definitely a great place to grab a quick bite so all those carbs will absorb the alcohol you're going to be drinking for the night...", 
            "was starving after a night of partying in the highest heels i owned, and we all wanted some immediate, rumbly-in-my-tumbly gratification. i've never been to earl of sandwhich but b and his friends always make a point to stop by on a vegas trip, so it must be pretty good. +1 already when i saw their list of hot sandwiches - i love hot sammiches. \n\nearl of sandwhich is just a short hop and a skip away from the casino, and the line was pretttty long. but the sandwiches were good enough and/or we were lazy enough that we ended up getting in line anyway. \n\nravenous b (as usual) ordered the cannonball! and <mark>The Earl's Club</mark>. cannonball! was only okay, nothing notable, but <mark>The Earl's Club</mark> was a very classic sandwich - can't go wrong there. i got the italian, which was bomb. even though the sandwiches are on the small side, i didn't end up eating all of it since we also got the chicken tortilla soup, which was delicious and scaldingly hot (\"and andrea, i mean scalding hot.\") another +1 since we both hate lukewarm soup. saved the last half of my sandwich to eat later that night, and it was still delicious.\n\nat ~$6 per sandwich, it's a little expensive for the size. but considering i paid that much for a glass of grapefruit juice later that day, this is probably the best deal you're going to get. aside from steak-and-eggs.", 
            "this is one of my favorite spots in vegas, and since it's open 24 hours i can go any time i want! their sandwiches  are delicious, the service is quick, and the food is very reasonably priced, too (only $5.99 for a sandwich). it's also conveniently located inside planet hollywood hotel just a minute's walk from fat tuesday, so you can kill two birds with one stone while you're here. \n\nmy personal favorites are <mark>The Full Montagu </mark> and <mark>The Earl's Club</mark>. we ended up ordering extra sandwiches for our way back home on our trip there this past weekend, so lucky for me i have an <mark>The Earl's Club</mark> waiting for me at home for lunch!",

            "i love earl of sandwich! ishhhh goood! the only reason i have ever tried this place was because i stayed at the planet hollywood and i came back from a night of partying and was sooooo hungry. thank god this place was open 24 / 7 yo! so i decided to get a earls club which is a turkey bacon sandwich. it looked like a normal sandwich as i watched them prepair it. the place made the sandwich fast and was wrapped in a a nice foil that actually kept the sandwich warm for quite some time. i  also want to mention alot of the people getting sandwichs here at night are people they came back from partying and drinking alot.  anyways i got my earls club brought it back to my room and just wanted something with bread in it to soak in the alcohol. first bite i toook of my <mark>The Earl's Club</mark> and i was feeling it! it was sooo goood! the bread had a nice crisp to it, it wasn't to crisp because u can feel the softness of it too. plus the turkey and bacon made it really good. most of the sandwichs at earl's i believe and hot sandwichs. i just got a sandwich and it was only 5-7 dollars. for a late night snack this really hit the spot. i was thinking of getting another one before i went to bed but decided to just wait until i wake up to get another one! hahaha sooo now everytime i stay at planet hollywood, i have to earl's sandwich. i think the way they make their sandwichs plus the way they prepare and toast the sandwich is kind of unique. their bread / sandwich's does have a distinct taste to it. please try this sandwich place if your staying at planet hollywood. the line is long during the day and during the night it goes by pretty fast.", 
            "this is a great deal in vegas and the food is yummy!! for the price of $5.99 for any toasted hot sandwich or salad, it is better than fast food. located in planet hollywood, expect a line, but the it goes by pretty fast. during my stay here this weekend, i came here twice!! it was that good and affordable. \n\nthe first time i was here, i got <mark>The Earl's Club</mark> and i split a cobb salad with a friend. the sandwich was a good size and very tasty and the salad was very fresh. i ate half my sandwich only and saved the other half for later - it was still good later..=) \n\nthe second time here, i got the broccoli & cheese soup and i split the chinese chicken salad with a friend. both did not disappoint again. \n\nthis place is open 24 hours and a great place for a bite. one of my places to eat when in vegas.",

            "located within the ph hotel and casino, earl of sandwich is a great place to stop by for a quick bite.  it's not a full sit down, and it's not a fast food joint.  it fits perfectly in between.  i've gone there as an early dinner and a late night snack.  \n\nno matter the time, <mark>The Full Montagu </mark>, <mark>The Original 1762 </mark>, and <mark>The Earl's Club</mark> are very, very good!  \n\nif you're really hungry, throw in a soup too.  they tend to be more thick and hardy, so it will help to fill you up.  \n\noverall, for the price, it's not the best sandwich shop in town, but the best on the strip.",

            "researchers at northwestern university conducted a study in mice linking late night eating to weight gain.  i, on the other hand, conducted a study of my own that found in a sample size of 3, following significant consumption of alcohol, there was a 100% chance that consuming a sandwich from e of s after 3am would be astronomically delicious.  \n\nlocated just inside the entrance of planet hollywood facing the strip, this is the ideal place to grab a late night snack if your wallet is thin from a cooler at the casino tables ($5.99) or you're too incoherent to sit down and order from a server or drive off the strip.  from the name, it's pretty obvious that the sandwiches are the star.  my first trip we ordered the <mark>Holiday Turkey</mark> and the carribean jerk sandwich and the sandwiches are all wrapped in foil and shaped like gold bars.  the first thing you will notice upon taking the first bite is the amazing panini-like crunch from the exterior of the bread followed by the chewy, gooey, and occasionally crispy components within.    the <mark>Holiday Turkey</mark> pretty much tasted like thanksgiving dinner between two amazing pieces of bread and the carribean jerk sandwich, albeit tasty, didn't necessarily remind me of the islands since i was expecting less mayo and more spice.  the remaining sandwiches all looked really solid, especially the roast beef, <mark>The Earl's Club</mark> sandwich, and <mark>The Full Montagu </mark>.   \n\nsomewhere along the hallways of the pantheon of great sandwiches, the earl himself is giving his seal of approval.",

(fyi- meat is not consistent. one of the sandwiches was medium rare and the other was well done). \n\n<mark>The Full Montagu </mark>- get this if you want <mark>Veggie</mark> and more bang for your buck. sandwich is about 1/4inch taller than the 1762.\n\n--------------\n\ntips:\n\n1. do not go 3 times in 24hours. you'll get sick of it and end up forcing it down or keeping it for later and eating it cold.\n\n2. visit after <mark>The Earl's Club</mark>. plenty of rowdy, drunk entertaining customers. \nhighlights include:  a drunk guy trying to fight two other drunk guys because he thought they were taking pictures of his ugly drunk gf, funny drunk pick up lines and lot's of people with food on their shirts.\n\n3. order a side of macaroni salad and put it inside your 1762.", 
            "mmm.. i'm wanting another <mark>Tuna Melt</mark> just thinking about writing this review! *droool! ahh! anyways..\n\nlocated in the miracle mile shopping center (closest to the casino!), this place is definitely a gem! for just 5.99$ you'll get yourself a delicious sandwich (their sandwiches are kind of a panini/subway mix) of your choice and you can't really beat that unless you step off the strip! \n\nit was not busy when we went (2pm-ish?)\n\nthe food: i tried the \n+_caribbean jerk chicken (it came with chicken, red/banana peppers, and spicy jerk sauce.) it was alllllright.. it was exactly what i expected but nothing that would keep me ordering more.\n+_<mark>Tuna Melt</mark>. (albacore tuna with aged swiss.) omg! must try. my boyfriend and i ended up getting an extra sandwich to split for the drive home and b-b-boy am i glad that we did! i had it when we got home and that aged swiss really really makes the difference! it just raised the bar for future <mark>Tuna Melt</mark> from anywhere else!\n+_<mark>The Earl's Club</mark> sandwich (turkey, bacon, aged swiss, lettuce, and <mark>Tomato</mark> dressed with sandwich sauce.) this was the boyfriend's sandwich and i was lucky i got to take one bite! haha he was finished with his sandwich wayy before i was!\n+_<mark>Potato Salad</mark> ($2) it was mehh. it was missing something.\n+_macaroni salad ($2) too muchh mayo for me.. another meh.\n\ni can't wait to try all the other sandwiches!", 
            "my sister and i had headed over to planet hollywood to try earl of sandwich on saturday afternoon as we wanted something close by and not terribly expensive. despite the massive line that greeted us when we arrived, it actually moved quickly and we waited for no more than 10-15 minutes before we were able to place our order. \n\nmy caprese sandwich was really good. i wasn't sure about it being classified as a \"hot sandwich\" on the menu when i ordered it (not really a fan of warm <mark>Tomato</mark>) but it was really tasty. it was warmed just enough to crisp the bread and make the mozzarella even more tender. my sister loved her <mark>The Earl's Club</mark> (turkey, bacon, cheese) as well. for the two sandwiches, two cookies, and two sodas, our bill was $21 which is not a bad price at all, especially since we left satisfied and full. \n\nsince this is such a popular place, seating can be tricky to find, so be patient. thankfully it's just a sandwich place, so turnover at the tables is pretty good as long as people don't linger once they are done. for a reasonable priced and good lunch in vegas, earl of sandwich is a great option.", 
            "i come here once or twice every time i go to vegas. i switch off between <mark>The Earl's Club</mark> and the italian. i always get a tomato soup because they put croutons in it and it tastes like magic. i usually take a bite of the sandwich and then drink a spoonful of the soup. if no one's looking, i use my sandwich as a spoon.\n\nsometimes there's a line but the service is usually really fast anyway.", 
            "this is a must have if you're staying at ph/towers. i ate here three times last weekend...<mark>The Earl's Club</mark> sandwhich is so good. the <mark>Potato Salad</mark> is delish...next time i'll have to try the desserts which look very dirrrty (yummy).", 
            "holy mother of sandwich. this place is amazeballs!!!! my girlfriend and i actually found it by accident, after a long night out & putting our friends to bed, wandering around our hotel casino and looking for food. we were directed here and thank goodness for that because we were starved. i had the blt and my girlfriend had <mark>The Earl's Club</mark>, easily the best sandwich i've ever had! we ended up making it our nightly routine for the weekend - go out to <mark>The Earl's Club</mark>, drink our faces off, go back to the hotel, get a sandwich! made my night every night. over the course of the weekend we also had the soup, brownies, and <mark><mark>Chicken Caesar</mark></mark> salad. everything was hot, fresh, and made quickly. it was super busy every time we went (including the first night at 4:30am), but our food came out pretty quickly and we never left hungry. not to mention the price was extremely good for what you get! on our way home we all commented on how we wished they had this place in calgary! until next time earl...",

            "yummmm....i got <mark>The Earl's Club</mark> & it was good!", 
            "great sandwiches at a low price. it's so refreshing to find a place that is light on the wallet without being light on the taste. breakfast, sandwiches, soups, salads, desserts and beverages. what else could you ask for? \n\nbreakfast was $3.99 for an egg, cheddar, and ham sandwich on  warm, soft, toasted bread. the bread really makes their sandwiches. \n\nlunch we had the creamy tomato soup ($3.99) which was great. it really was creamy with a nice amount of herbs, garlic and croutons. for sandwiches we tried the italian (awesome), <mark>The Earl's Club</mark> (great), <mark>The Full Montagu </mark> (good), and the caprese (tasty, but not my favorite compared to the others). $5.99 for those.  once again, the bread makes it.\n\nwhat's really cool is everything is packaged to go (including the soup) so it's easy to carry back to the room or to find a place to sit as they have quite a bit of seating.\n\nfor tasty, cheap eats, this is a must stop.",

            "i am so glad i ended my vegas trip eating at earl of sandwich, and even more glad that they're opening up a second location in anaheim. it was delicious and better than what i had expected. i already had seen the reviews, heard the raves about the warm sandwiches from my friend, but it was so delicious that it has to be about the best sandwich ever - and at an affordable price!\n\nso earl's is open 24 hours and is located in planet hollywood. i'm sure people flock here after <mark>The Earl's Club</mark> events and whatnot - that explains the 24 hours deal. we came here around 12 on a saturday and there was a long line, but not too long a wait. you basically give your order to the cashier and she gives you a beeper and a receipt where you slide down the counter (watching them make the sandwiches and salads) before you pay at the second cashier. and a few minutes after that, your beeper rings signaling you to pick up your sandwich. \n\nthere were so many great options that i really wanted to try them all. in the end, i got <mark>The Earl's Club</mark> (roasted turkey, smoked bacon, aged swiss cheese, lettuce, roma <mark>Tomato</mark> & sandwich sauce) and my friend got the tuna and we traded half. <mark>The Earl's Club</mark> was really good - but what's so great about it is that the bread is warm and crispy, making the sandwich an overall plus. there wasn't too much bacon, but i liked the amount of turkey that was in it. the tuna was also great. the warm bread, a plus, and the tuna salad inside was awesome (better than subway!). they cut the sandwich for you into a bigger half and a smaller half, but the overall sandwich is not that big. perhaps about 6 inches. each is wrapped up in a gold foil with a pretty sticker to differentiate between the various sandwiches. \n\nthere's a few tables to sit down and eat and relax. for the price of the sandwich (around six/seven dollars), i was pretty pleased. if only they came with some complimentary <mark>Potato Chips</mark> on the side :) \n\ncan't wait to try the other sandwiches!", 
            "must admit, this place does it stuff good, but i did only try two things. i got the tuna sandwich because my friend told me to. i asked for extra lettuce and <mark>Tomato</mark>, but they were kinda skimpy on that. one thing i don't like is that they don't ask what toppings you want on your sandwich. i want me more <mark>Veggie</mark>, goddarnittt!!! :-p but the sandwich was tasty. good size for me, but i was surprised my boyfriend or any guy would be satiated by a sandwich this size. \n\nmy boyfriend enjoyed <mark>The Earl's Club</mark> so much he ordered it both times we went.\n\nsecond time, i got the tomato soup. ooooooo my god. it was savory yet sweet and creamy and piping hot. the croutons they put in there stay crisp on the inside, although i wish they didn't put the croutons in before you even open your soup. \n\ngood price for vegas and good taste. i'm joining the earl's fans.\nhonestly wish i could have had it one last time before i left vegas...", 
            "love this place! they make awesome sandwiches.  i really think its their bread.  \ni ordered <mark>The Earl's Club</mark> which i always order when i go and it has been always yummy. my hubby has tried several of their other sandwiches and has never had any complaint.  \n\nwhy i only gave four stars is because of the people taking my order.  they have never been friendly. always seem to have the look of \"i want to be anywhere but here\".  if i had a question or wanted to change the cheese they offered on the sandwich it seemed like i just another anoying customer they had to deal with.",

            "after partying all night friday / saturday, i woke up sunday afternoon craving a sandwich. i've heard great things about earl's so i decided to trek over to planet hollywood and check it out. when i arrived around 12pm the line had no less than 20 people and every table was taken. the line actually moves really fast, so don't let this deter you. i was at the counter placing my order within 12 minutes flat. i literally spent my time in line scanning the menu and trying to make a decision...everything looks so freakin good!  \n\nsandwich: i had <mark>The Original 1762 </mark> <mark>The Earl's Club</mark> - turkey, bacon, swiss, sandwich sauce, lettuce & tomato. bread is soft and crunchy and the ingredients are fresh. most definitely better than any other chain sandwich joint. \n\nsoup: if you even remotely like tomato soup you must try earl's! the consistency is more like a bisque and it has massive homemade croutons mixed in. perfect cure for any hangover! \n\nprices are super reasonable - my order came up to about $10...not bad for a good hearty lunch in vegas.",

            "so a friend of mine tagged herself here last year and i thought the name was pretty catchy so i made it a goal to check it out. i've been 3 times now... dec (2012) and march & april (2013).\n\n=========\nlocation\n=========\n\nit's located in planet hollywood, right on the strip. it's kind've a mall food court type of atmosphere. long subway type make-line, big dining area.\n\n\n=========\nthe subs\n=========\n\n~ <mark>The Earl's Club</mark> - turkey, bacon, swiss, sandwich sauce, lettuce & tomato. this was really amazing and out of the 5+ sandwiches i've tried... it was definitely the best. (5/5)\n\n~ <mark>Chipotle <mark>Chicken Bacon Avocado</mark></mark> - grilled chicken, bacon, sharp cheddar, avocado, lettuce & chipotle sauce. i tried this my first time there back in december. <mark>The Full Montagu </mark> was disappointing and while sitting there i saw this had avocado, chipotle sauce and bacon... some of my favorite things. it was really good. (4/5)\n\n~ italian - salami, capicola, roasted ham, mortadella, mozzarella, tomato & italian dressing. this looks pretty simple and there's not of a \"sandwich\" taste since there's not many <mark>Veggie</mark>... but the meats and cheese a delicious. fattening but delicious.

(3/5)\n\n~ brownie - this was pretty subpar. it was a brownie. not good, not terrible... not worth it. (2/5)\n\n~ chocolate chip cookie -  it was pretty disgusting. took one bite, putrid. tried a second bite... tossed it. (1/5)\n\n===============\nfinal thoughts\n===============\n\nall-in-all this place is a 3 stars. the subs are good but only 6-inches and for $6-each... it's a bit pricey. however it's vegas where $6.00 is a deal... so it gets a bonus point for that. all of their sandwiches are pretty good, haven't had a bad one yet. plus all their sandwiches are hot ones. do i prefer subway over this place. sure... but it's still pretty good.\n\nlast off stay away from the sides / snacks, they're terrible. and $6 for a 12oz bottle of blue moon? walk down about 100 yards to the store that sells the souvenirs and alcohol and you can get a 22oz giant blue moon for $3.50.\n\n---------------------------\n*edit -  next time i'm in vegas i need to try... the carribean jerk chicken and <mark>The Original 1762 </mark> 1762.",

            "after reading so many reviews, my wife and i thought we would give it a try.  this place was hidden away in planet hollywood.\n\ni had <mark>The Earl's Club</mark> sandwich and the wife had the chipolte chicken.  both were very good and made well and were perfectly toasted.\n\ncan't say much about the service because you just give your order and then they call you when food was done.\n\nif you have chance to go to vegas. give this place a try.  nice thing is that it is open 24/7.", 
            "if you are drunk and you're in vegas, heck, even if you're not drunk and in vegas, this is the place to be. \n\njust try any sandwich and it will taste like heaven because 1) it's probably the cheapest thing you can get in vegas even cheaper than cheap hookers lol just kidding 2) the best drunk hot sandwich you will ever taste and 3) the best next-day hangover sandwich because you didn't finish it the night before \n\ni recommend <mark>The Earl's Club</mark> or the chipotle sandwiches. \n\nthe only downside is that the lines are ridiculous. but you will be with friends so the time in line will go by pretty fast.", 
            "this place still never disappoints.  after a fun and drunk night out, any of their sandwiches will hit the spot.  <mark>The Earl's Club</mark> is always my go-to sandwich.  it is even better with the steak sauce they have on their tables.\n\ngo get your bricks of gold now!", 
            "went here while i am in vegas and it was delicious.  prices were very fair for being on the strip, around $7 for a great sandwich.  i had <mark>The Earl's Club</mark> and it was one of the best i have ever had.  service was more then adequate,  location was good and easy to find.",

            "absolutely love this place!! every time i come to vegas, i make sure i go to planet hollywood to get my fix of earl of sandwich! \n\nlocated right next to the casino and edge of the shopping area, it gets a lot of traffic and there's always been a line. takes a good 10 minutes to get my food but it's so worth it! they give you a buzzer so you can find a seat while waiting. \n\nthe best part about the sandwiches is the bread! the focaccia-like bread is crispy on the outside, chewy on the inside and is amazing once toasted. i would go back just for the bread!! \n\nmy favorite is the <mark>Chipotle <mark>Chicken Bacon Avocado</mark></mark>: zesty chipotle sauce gives the grilled chicken a bit of a spicy kick while the avocado, bacon, and lettuce adds texture and flavor. i've also tried <mark>The Earl's Club</mark>, which is also delicious! you can't go wrong with any of the hot sandwiches!", 
            "we weren't even hungry but seeing that there was no line for earl's for once, we hopped up to the front to order. the delicious aroma of the sandwiches wafting in the air definitely got us hungry. got <mark>The Earl's Club</mark> and <mark>The Full Montagu </mark>. both were delicious sandwichs. my favorite was <mark>The Earl's Club</mark>, love the basic ingredients in this sandwich, especially the spread that they used. <mark>The Full Montagu </mark> with it's roast beef and mustard was good too!\n\nif only this place did not have the usual long lines, i would definitely go here again. the price and quality left me quite satisfied.", 
            "the thing about food places that are open really late or 24 hours is that half of their customers are drunks feeding their drunchies (drunk munchies) or hungover. the problem with people eating food when they're drunk or hungover is that taste buds are heightened so food tastes so much better than it would if you were sober or not drinking the night before. that being said i thought my sandwich was amazing. full disclosure: i was drunk when i ate it. who knows what i would have thought if i ate it while sober.\n\ni split the <mark>Chipotle <mark>Chicken Bacon Avocado</mark></mark> with a friend because there's an earl of sandwich close to home in anaheim and i've seen those gold bricks sandwiches on instagram posts which looked larger than life. i regret that decision and wish i'd gotten my own sandwich because i devoured that half sandwich. we got chipotle sauce on the side because i put sauce only if the sandwich is bland. surprise surprise it wasn't bland and i ended up not using any of the chipotle sauce at all. bacon was crunchy and perfect. the mac and cheese was amazing. my drunk self decided to put the mac and cheese in the sandwich and it was a flavor explosion.\n\nthe line goes right out of the store and next to gambling tables. this line moves slowly because on a summer saturday night/sunday morning at 3 am there was only one cashier. if you're an attractive female coming straight from <mark>The Earl's Club</mark> in a dress and heels, the gamblers at the table will look and stare at you to the point that it would make even an intoxicated person uncomfortable. best to look away and ignore them. you've been warned.", 
            "super good sammy's! we were hungry from driving so long and it hit the spot!! had the <mark>Chipotle <mark>Chicken Bacon Avocado</mark></mark> and earl club and they were both delicious in their own way. loved the bacon on both! the thousand island dressing on <mark>The Earl's Club</mark> was a nice touch and the chipotle sauce on the <mark>Chipotle <mark>Chicken Bacon Avocado</mark></mark> sandwich had a tiny bit of heat but it was a great balance with the avocado. had the little mediterranean <mark>Pasta Salad</mark> and chips on side which was yummy! very good place!",

            "i'm so glad i stayed in the planet hollywood hotel because i literally had 24/7 access to earl of sandwich! yay!\n\nin the span of my four days in vegas, i had earl's three times. sooo satisfying and really great for a midnight snack. service is speedy and the price is reasonable.\nmy favorite sandwich  so far is the <mark>Tuna Melt</mark>. if you love tuna, eating one is a must. it was packed full of flavor, and i especially love their panini-like bread! ahh. i also had <mark>The Original 1762 </mark> 1762 one night, which was alright. the horseradish did add a nice kick to it, though.\n\nhowever, i'm not a huge fan of the breakfast. the ham, cheedar, and egg breakfast muffin was way too salty.\n\none of the best sandwiches, hands down. i'm already miss this place! they need to open one in california!", 
            "this is my very first review after coming back from south korea! i got back 2 weeks ago.. and went to vegas for the weekend with the family, and i knew this would be a great opportunity to rack up some yelp reviews to make up for lost time!!\n\nso i drove in and went to the coveted earl of sandwich.. \n\nthis place is as good as they say! i tried 4 sandwiches and a soup thanks to my family, and we each got:\n\ncaribbean jerk chicken: mine! this was really good and spicy, with banana peppers and nicely grilled chicken. twas delicious.\n<mark>The Original 1762 </mark>: my mom/dad split this one..  we all really liked it as we exchanged sandwiches (benefits of having a family that loves variety :p) good roast beef! and <mark>The Original 1762 </mark> is a solid choice...no wonder why this place became so popular! \n<mark>The Full Montagu </mark>: my sister got this one.. and we all agreed that it was our favorite out of the 3... it had turkey? and roast beef... and cheese with lettuce.. delicious.\ntomato soup: it was like gourmet spaghetti-os... it was ok and had croutons, but i don't remember how much it was... i'd rather have gotten another sandwich.\n\nmy sister and i went for a second round...so we got:\n\nthe italian. this is by far our most favorite sandwich. this is the reason why you need to come here. i learned that mortadello was italian bologna, and it came with mozzarella, tomato, and it was good, good, gooooooooood!!!\n\noh, and the <mark>Earl Grey Lemonade</mark> needs sugar. nothing 4 splenda's can't fix. or you could just get a pink lemonade too.. \n\nthere's so much i wanted to try too! the meatball, hawaiian chicken, etc etc.. \n\nfood. fresh and hot.\nservice. quick.\n\neach sandwich i had was definitely worth $5.99. 5 stars. simple as that.", 
            "i have heard so many friends rave about earls that i feel like i've been here a thousand times.  finally i can put an end to all the \"you've got to try earl's\" and \"you've never been to earl's?\" and \"dude, earl's is amazing\" because i ate at earl's!!!  is everyone quite satisfied now?\n\nthis earl's is in the planet hollywood casino which attributes to its popularity and long lines.  i don't think there is anywhere on the strip you could find a more affordable meal unless you are completely desperate and stumble towards a fast food chain like mcdonald's or subway.  speaking of subway, earl's is nothing like subway or quiznos for that matter.  i was somewhat expecting earl's to be like these two popular chains but fortunately, earl's was a few hundred notches up on the sandwich ladder.  earl has a extremely efficient ordering and sandwich production line.  i promplty received my order within a couple minutes of payment, mind you, there was quite the crowd so the speed of execution was quite impressive and would make any vp of operations proud.\n\nwhen a place is so hyped up i'm usually faced with bitter disappointment but i'm happy to say that this time, with earl's, i wasn't disappointed.  mind you, it wasn't a life altering experience and harps and giggling angels didn't fill my head after the first bite but overall, it was one of my best sandwich experiences.\n\nbecause of all the hype, i took it upon myself to try as many sandwiches during my visit as possible so i promptly ordered <mark>The Original 1762 </mark> roast beef, <mark>The Earl's Club</mark>, the italian and the jerk chicken along with a brownie, a blue moon beer and a coke.  before you start pondering what a complete pig i am, i shared these with my group of 4 so everyone got a 1/4 sandwich each.  this was a great way to try a wide selection of their sandwiches, a prix fix earl's sampling if you would.\n\non to the actual sandwiches. \n\n<mark>The Original 1762 </mark> was superb.  the roast beef was juicy and flavorful, the horshradish was spicy and blended perfectly with the beef and sharp cheddar cheese.  it was light years ahead of the roast beef sandwich i had at quiznos just a few weeks before. <mark>The Earl's Club</mark> was also very delightful with turkey and ham with fresh lettece and <mark>Tomato</mark>.  the italian wasn't my favorite with its pastrami and ham combination but everyone else in my group thought it was terrific, i guess i'm not a big fan of pastrami.  for me, the star of the show was the jerk chicken.  the chicken was moist and the jerk sauce added a spicy kick to this exceptional sandwich.  the thing that made all these sandwiches special was the bread.  only one kind of bread is served at earl's and its their artisan white perfectly toasted.  if you believe that bread is what makes a great sandwich then earl's should be your sandwich mecca because you would be extremely hard pressed to find another worthy opponent.\n\nhmmmm, i seem to have written too much....i doubt any of you will actually read to this point but for those that make it this far, thanks, i'm relieved my rambling was entertaining enough to retain your attention for this long.  i guess i'll just summerize earl's in one last line.  if you haven't tried earl of sandwich, you should listen to all these 5 star yelp reviews and take the plunge, you'll most likely become another raver like myself.", 
            "what a great spot when you are craving something a little more mellow instead of the glutenous buffets that are everywhere in vegas.  my buddy was raving about this place on the ride up from the oc and claimed that it was the best sandwich shop and blew away the quiznos, togos and subways of the world.  the place is simple... sandwiches with great flavor combinations.  i went with <mark>The Original 1762 </mark> classic - roast beef with a light horseraddish sauce on a warm toasted bread... oohhh... makes me hungry now just thinking about it.", 
            "i'm not sure what the hype is about this place. i came here expecting a lot given the large amount of 4-5 star yelp reviews, and i left disappointed. i ordered <mark>The Original 1762 </mark> because i figured that i couldn't go wrong with an original. i guess i should just not expect so much when i eat at a 4-5 star according to yelp restaurant. the sandwich was tiny. the flavor tasted off because of the horseradish. i was so, so, so disappointed. \n\ni also got the chicken noodle soup because it was cold, and i wanted soup. that was average. i'm glad i got the soup or i'd have still been hungry after that tiny sandwich. to be fair, i was eating buffets during the earlier part of my trip to vegas. but, i still think the sandwich could have been a lot better given all these rave reviews.", 
            "best sandwiches in the world and i am not kidding! too bad they only have a few locations throughout the usa but who cares! its the best in the world! i eat at earl's at least 3 times every vegas trip!\n\ni will begin reviewing each sandwich shortly...\n\ncarribean jerk chicken sandwich:\nmy personal favorite on the menu! i love the banana peppers and the right amount of spicyness of this sandwich. i even add tabasco sauce to kick it up a little bit! this is a must have if you have never been to earl before.  my personal favorite!\n\nitalian sandwich:\nitalian sandwiches are great wherever you go but this certainly is one of the best sandwiches on the menu. make sure you eat it right away while its hot and order the delicious salt n vinegar chips to go along with it!\n\ntuna sandwich:\none of the simplest sandwiches on the menu with it having only 2 ingredients on the inside, albacore tuna and swiss cheese.  the bread is of course what makes this sandwich but every sandwich is served hot and this hot tuna sandwich was superb!\n\n<mark>The Original 1762 </mark>:\nif you're into horse raddish and roast beef this is awesome! i also love the earl's spicy mustard they put to add some kick to it!\n\nearl's frozen lemonade: \nexcellent! just like the frozen lemonade you buy at disneyland. cheap too!\n\ncaprese sandwich:\nif you've ever been to italy or just had mozarella and tomato caprese or just enjoy something without meat, this sandwich does the trick. too bad they dont make this smaller, because it would be a great appetizer.\n\nkono coffee:\nnot bad, i prefer walking to coffee bean inside miracle mile!", 
            "conveniently located in planet hollywood, right by the entrance to the miracle mile shops and close enough to the casino. i enjoyed <mark>The Original 1762 </mark> 1762. the hot sandwich didn't have much (roast beef, cheddar cheese, and horseradish sauce with no <mark>Veggie</mark>), but it was perfect the way it was. juicy roast beef that wasn't overcooked with the cheese melted right on top. their coffee is quite good too. the place is open 24 hours, so it's a great place to pick up a meal at any time of day. free wi-fi too!", 
            "okay this place is really just 3.5 stars in my book but being open 24 hours a day, located in my hotel, and cheap gives it an extra half of star. theres nothing spectacular about these sandwiches but it is an excellent value. we tried <mark>The Original 1762 </mark>, <mark>The Full Montagu </mark>, and one with turkey and cranberries that was bomb. i wanted to like this place more and was expecting more after all the great reviews. it was tastey and soaked up some booze at 5am.", 
            "every sandwich i've tried here was amazing. and trust me: i hate paying for sandwiches that i can surely do myself...but, they are just toooooo effing delicious to pass up.\n\n<mark>Tuna Melt</mark>: o-m-g soooo effing good. especially with their potatoe salad.\nthe cannonball: meatballs with marinara sauce make it like pasta in bread.\n<mark>The Original 1762 </mark> (roast beef, cheese) and the earl (turkey, bacon, etc) are both savory and rich.\n\n\nbest thing is they are open 24 hours. when i was here for new year's eve, they were a savior in the hunger department at 2am.",

            "this being the 720th review for earl of sandwich, im wondering if there's really any need to go into any kind of detail. yelpers, for the most part, are an astute bunch and should be able to figure out that this is probably the safest bet on the strip. trix had <mark>The Original 1762 </mark> and it was awesome. i had a cannonballs!, also awesome. reasonably priced and very fast. \n\nfucking a, man.",

            "i really enjoyed this place!  i'm not sure if they have different locations.  i went to the one in planet hollywood.  it was so good!  i tried <mark>The Original 1762 </mark> (roast beef, cheese, horseradish dressing) and <mark>The Full Montagu </mark> (roast beef, turkey, swiss, cheddar, lettuce, tomato & mustard).  both were awesome.  the sandwiches are toasted to perfection =)  i also liked the <mark>Potato Salad</mark> and the tomato soup (with croutons).  everything was delicious!  i'll definitely try them again.",

            "wow. heavenly. we ate here 4 times over the course of our 3-day stay, and it was great. the best sandwiches were <mark>The Full Montagu </mark> (better than <mark>The Original 1762 </mark>) and all-american, and the cobb salad never disappointed. the bacon-based breakfast sandwiches were kinda salty, so avoid those, but pretty much anything is great because it comes with their delicious baked-in-the-grill bread and has a great balance of flavors. i highly recommend that you go out of your way if you're in vegas just to try this place at least once (by the way, it's located on the south end at the junction of the casino area and the mall area).", 
            "read the reviews and decided to give it a go.  definitely was not disappointed.  it was lunchtime on a saturday and the place had a decent line going.  the menu is fairly extensive so you'll likely find something you'll like.  \n\ni had <mark>The Original 1762 </mark> roast beef which was freakin' awesome.  it was warm, gooey from the melted cheese and just really flavorful.  put a little dijon mustard on there and you have a piece of sandwich heaven in your hands.\n\nmy fiancee had the <mark>Tuna Melt</mark> and from the bite that i had... or rather, the only bite she allowed me... it was very good as well.  \n\nprices aren't all that bad for a damn good sandwich.  will i return?  probably.  it's a nice alternative to countless buffets and foo-fooey restaurants in sin city.", 
            "on my last trip to vegas, one afternoon i woke up to discover that three different groups of people i went there to meet had independently decided to go to earl of sandwich.  although i had never heard of this place before, it was clear that i had to try it, and i am definitely glad that i did.\n\nthe first thing that stands out about earl of sandwich is the price.  when you are used to paying $8-10 for a sandwich in dc, $6 for a sandwich is fantastic.  and when that $6 sandwich tastes better than any that you're used to, it's mind-blowing to say the least.\n\ni tried <mark>The Original 1762 </mark> 1762, a roast beef sandwich with cheddar cheese and horseradish sauce.  i also had a taste of <mark>The Full Montagu </mark>, which has roast beef, turkey, swiss, cheddar, lettuce, <mark>Tomato</mark> and mustard.  first off, the bread is outstanding.  it's toasted and has a great crunch to it, without being overly thick.  the meats are also great and the sandwiches have a good amount on them.  although the sandwiches are a bit on the small side, they are ok for a smaller meal, especially when paired with chips or soup (which i did not personally try, but have heard good things about).\n\noverall it's a great place to go and i highly recommend it.  that sandwich was one of the best i've ever had and i wish i had had time to try more of their menu.  whether it's a late night snack or lunch, earl of sandwich is definitely worth checking out.", 
            "hella delicious sandwiches. \ni went for <mark>The Original 1762 </mark> 1762 and it was like bliss touching the lips. roast beef, cheddar chese, horseradish sauce. super reasonable prices for anywhere and even better pricing since it is in vegas. a sandwich is around 7 dollars. \ni don't know what it is with the bread, but it isn't a standard roll. it's sorta ciabatta-ish but not as tough. it held up to the sauces and meats inside nicely. great bread.\nthey have grey poupon and yellow mustard at the tables. i found myself using the grey poupon as sort of taqueria hot sauce and adding it on top as i bite into the succulent sandwich.\n\nit was so tasty, that we had it for lunch, partied, left at like 3-4am and went back for another one. i had <mark>The Earl's Club</mark> this time and it was equally as good. \n\nopen 24 hours!",

            "i wish i could give 4.5 stars. the only thing holding back is atmosphere - this place is in a mall with smokey gambling pits nearby.  that being said, the food was, although simple sandwich fare, pretty darn tasty for fast food.  i ordered <mark>The Original 1762 </mark> 1762 sandwich - roast beef, sharp cheddar & creamy horseradish. beef was very thinly sliced and seemed of quite nice quality and the artisan bread was good, with plenty of horseradish sauce that was just perfectly spicy.",

            "one word: overrated\n\ni tried.  i really tried to like earl's but, i just don't see the hype.  after hearing my friends rave about how good the sandwiches here are, i had to see for myself.\n\ni've tried <mark>The Original 1762 </mark>, <mark>The Full Montagu </mark>, caribbean jerk chicken, and some others (while incredibly inebriated) and all of them, to be honest, tasted really bland or dry (or both) to me. nothing special.  i'd rather have a sandwich from subway...\n\nfirst visiting back in early october, i've since visited 5 more times and i still don't get what's so great.  i guess it's probably the fact that earl's is open 24/7, so after a night of clubbing, drinking, and dancing, you want to get your munchies on; and where else can you go for relatively cheap food (compared to other restaurant joints in vegas, i.e. expensive casino cafes), other than denny's at 5 am?  i've recommended pho kim long hundreds of times to my friends, but no one wants to hail a taxi to chinatown half wasted and/or already feeling the symptoms of a hangover.\n\none thing that's cool though is if you're a ph vip member, all you have to do is flash your card at the cashier, and you get to cut the ridiculous line earl's always has.  it's kind of a douche move, but hey, saves us a lot of time to go do extra things, like gamble or catch up on some sleep! :)", 
            "if you want yummy and amazing hot sandwiches for a cheap price in las vegas, earl of sandwich is the place to be! \n\ni have been going to this joint every time i visit las vegas because the sandwiches here are one of the best i ever had! the last time we went to earl of sandwich, i had the <mark>Holiday Turkey</mark> sandwich. that sandwich in itself got me full for only $6 and i was happily satisfied because it has so much flavor and everything you can look for in a <mark>Holiday Turkey</mark> sandwich - oven-roasted turkey slices, cranberry sauce, stuffing, and mayonnaise. i love how my hungry appetite disappeared right away because of this sandwich and my other favorite, <mark>The Original 1762 </mark> 1762.\n\nit's a very good thing they are open 24 hours, 7 days a week because in times where the hardcore munchies begin right after a night of club hopping, drinking, and dancing, i know that earl of sandwich will not disappoint.",

            "bomb sandwiches. another pro is the efficiency of ordering, grabbing what you want, then paying--similar to a cafeteria but upgraded because the sandwiches are just so damn good. the actual content of the sandwiches is nothing innovating, but the bread is really delicious. the perfect combination of crispy and bready-ness without being overpowering over the entire sandwich as a whole. really filling especially for the price. i've tried <mark>The Original 1762 </mark> and the <mark>All American</mark> and both were delicous. i've also tried their desserts and definitely think it's worth the extra $2 if you have a sweet tooth post-sandwich. overall, i give earl of sandwiches a 4 for being delicious and also inexpensive. the only downside is it is located on the strip within planet hollywood and that can be annoying to get to if you're a local (which i am). still delicious though :).", 
            "i tried to like earl's a lot. i like the concept of a hot sandwich with quality ingredients. the first time i tried caribbean jerk chicken which was tasty, then i tried the italian which was not too impressive. the chicken noodle soup was wayy too salty. i guess the great thing is that it's affordable, open 24 hours, and a great gathering spot for people after <mark>The Earl's Club</mark> are closed. maybe i'll try <mark>The Original 1762 </mark> for next time.",

            "after seeing so many people review them on yelp, i was stoked to finally check out earl of sandwich.  from the way people hand them five stars and how they've earned about 1,800 reviews, it's like they're sandwich royalty!\n\nwhen a couple of my friends and i stopped by to grab a quick dinner before meeting with everyone else, we fully expected to run into a line.  given their popularity, we figured it wouldn't be a question of \"if\" there would be a wait, but \"how long\", especially since we were going around 7:00.  much to our surprise, there wasn't a single person ahead of us when we got there.  score!  \n\nsince my friend and i both wanted to try a couple of their sandwiches, we decided to get two different types to share.  while she ordered <mark>The Original 1762 </mark> 1762 (roast beef, sharp cheddar, and horseradish sauce), i ordered the italian (salami, capicola, roasted ham, mortadella, mozzarella, roma <mark>Tomato</mark>, and italian dressing).  even though i tried to set aside any expectations i had, it was tough trying to block out the reviews i read.  while the sandwiches were decent, they fell a little short for me.  with all the hype though, it was bound to happen.\n\n- <mark>The Original 1762 </mark> 1762 (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/dkys3arloha8si5uuemhow?select=rejjpoepwak0flvh-bkn0g) - it's essentially a roast beef sandwich, but its simplicity worked.  the roast beef and sharp cheddar were nice, but it was the horseradish sauce that did it for me - potent enough for a kick, but not enough to be harsh.  i wish the meat had been a little more medium rare than medium though.  \n- italian (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/dkys3arloha8si5uuemhow?select=k8po4fzjs9cgjcysodhfrw) - okay, but i think the hot italian at jj boulangerie at the paris hotel is better (and bigger).  i liked the blend of flavors from the meat, but it was hard to separate them out.  the roma <mark>Tomato</mark> added some freshness, but i could have used less of them.  ditto for the italian dressing.\n\nregardless of anything else, earl is an especially budget friendly option given its location on the strip (sandwiches were about $7.00 each).  plus points as well for being open 24 hours - way better for late night munchies than the 24 cafe at paris or the bar at bally's.  for those reasons, i'm rounding up from three and a half to four.  had we actually gone then (drunk) instead of for dinner (sober), i probably would have loved earl of sandwich.  instead, depending on the sandwich i want, i might lean towards jj boulangerie instead and save my earl trips for post drinking/clubbing adventures.",

            "no vegas trip is complete without a trip to earl's, period. no, it's not the best thing i've ever eaten, but it's a pretty darn good sandwich and for the price, i can think of little else comparably good on the strip.\n\nthe bread is what makes the sandwich; it's warm, crusty and is the right denseness to hold the ingredients together and still be satisfying but not heavy.\n\nthe big debate among our group is whether <mark>The Full Montagu </mark> or <mark>The Original 1762 </mark> is the superior sandwich. you certainly get more flavors with <mark>The Full Montagu </mark>, but i love horseradish. such a hard choice. \n\nthe line is earl's downside, even though it goes pretty quick. but if it is especially bad, you can avoid it by ordering the sandwich over the phone and gamble or stop by the abc store around the corner for a few minutes. then head to the front of the line past everyone waiting to pay!", 
            "ended up here after a long night/morning at the marquee. i believe they are open 24/7 because we rolled in at 4 a.m. food was good, staff was super friendly and the wait for the food was short.  i had \"<mark>The Original 1762 </mark>\" sandwich and my husband had \"<mark>The Full Montagu </mark>\" both were delicious and filling! will go again!!", 
            "before my boyfriend and i headed home, we passed by this location and decided to buy a sandwich for the road. there was a pretty long line, but it moved fairly fast.\n\ni wasn't sure of what to get, so i just ordered <mark>The Original 1762 </mark>--roast beef with sharp cheddar & creamy horseradish sauce. it turned out to be the right choice! the horseradish nicely complemented the roast beef, and the bread was nicely toasted.\n\ni'll be sure to stop by here again when i want some quick, tasty food without overspending.", 
            "the first time i tried the famous earl of sandwich, i tried the caribbean jerk chicken. i was not a fan of the peppery flavor.\n\nthis time, i went for <mark>The Original 1762 </mark>. best choice ever! i was hesitant when i read that it had horseradish sauce, but i figured this was the house specialty - it's got to be good.\n\nand was it. pure awesome. i don't like horseradish usually, but cobined with the rich flavor of the roast beef and other meats, it was perfect.\n\nin fact, my boyfriend and i liked our sandwiches so much that we ordered 8 more to bring home with us after we left vegas. hell yeah!", 
            "breakfast, lunch, dinner, pre-club, or post-club as the sun is rising, earl of sandwich is good 24/7.\n\nprobably one of the best value-priced meals on the strip.  so cheap, simple, but well executed.  also, more than likely you'll encounter a massive line.  don't worry, it does move relatively quickly, so just wait! \n\nthe menu is also pretty big, but my favorites are <mark>The Original 1762 </mark> and italian.", 
            "convenient, cheap, fast and great for a meal on the strip!  \n\ndon't expect a packed meat sandwich and a carnivore's favorite sandwich, but a sandwich that is simply good when you're hungry and want a clean meal!\n\ni got their original, which was aye okay!  i love drenching my sandwiches with mustard, so i did that with <mark>The Original 1762 </mark>!  it was then bomb diggity.\n\nalso, this sandwich place is opened around the clock!  what a perk!", 
            "can i just say, you gotta get <mark>The Original 1762 </mark> 1762. roast beef (tender, moist, delicious) + the tang of the horseradish sauce (man, i love horseradish) + the crunch from the toasted bread = the perfect equation for a hungry belly and somewhat dwindling wallet (when in vegas, right?). for the price, you really can't go wrong, but earl of sandwich made it nearly impossible to ruin the good thing they have got going on there. \n\nalso made sure that i tried their soup (hey, i was hungry), and i got their chicken noodle. yum, perfect chicken noodle. didn't take away from the sandwich at all.\n\nanother must order from there is the <mark>Tuna Melt</mark>. i told my friends that it was the \"super better\" version of mcdonald's. scratch that, this can't even compare to mcdonald's. once again the crunch from the toasted bread made this sandwich spot on. \n\ni was really hoping for such thing as a takeout/delivery to hawaii. i'd be eating these all day errday! hoping to go back to vegas soon, specifically for these golden sandwiches.", 
            "honestly, i expected more from earl of sandwiches because of the hype surrounding it.  we had the cannonball sandwich (meatballs) and the jerk chicken.  i preferred the jerk chicken with the roasted bell peppers.  i had a few bites of the <mark>Hawaiian BBQ</mark>, which i would pick again.  given the chance to eat at earl of sandwiches again,  i would try <mark>The Earl's Club</mark> or <mark>The Original 1762 </mark>.  \nif i'm in vegas, i'm not going out of my way to seek it out otherwise, at least i know where to locate it if i'm in the mood for a sandwich.  pluses - the line moves very fast, it's open late and lots of sweets to select from while waiting to pay.", 
            "it's good. does it live up to all the hype that people put on it? no. but for a late night/early morning/middle of the day/anytime you want snack? it does the job. they have a relatively good selection of sandwiches/salads/soups. i had <mark>The Original 1762 </mark>, the italian and <mark>The Full Montagu </mark>. all were good sandwiches, but nothing to write home about.", 
            "this is the best sandwich place i've ever been to!  the first experience i had with earl was the store in anaheim and i felt in love with it ever since. i've heard many friends recommended the vegas store so thought i will stop by for a try.  the vegas earl in planet hollywood taste so much better than the anaheim store.  the bread was not as hard as the one in anaheim so that's definitely a plus!\n\nit's so good that me and my husband ordered 2 sandwiches to go for our trip back to la. seriously, it's that good!  you gotta try it to believe it!  recommend <mark>The Original 1762 </mark> an <mark>The Full Montagu </mark> sandwich.", 
            "when i was researching for places to eat in vegas, earl of sandwich was nowhere on my to go places.  my thought was, i flew hundred of miles to vegas and a sandwich is not exactly glamorous or fancy!  we stayed at the cosmopolitan and so planet hollywood is literally right across the street.  it was 3 am one night and my boyfriend was hungry, so i thought hey why not?? it's close by and it's open 24/7.\n\ni got the <mark>Tuna Melt</mark> and my boyfriend got <mark>The Original 1762 </mark>.  it was amazing.  seriously.  i know it's just a sandwich but it was seriously the most delicious sandwich i've ever had in my life.  the bread and temperature was right on point.  and if you factor in the ridiculous cheap price to get this piece of heaven, no wonder why this is ranked #1 on yelp for vegas! so glad the fat girl and boy in us were craving for food at 3 am and had earl of sandwich introduced into our lives.  \n\nmy boyfriend made me walked back here 3 times to get more sandwiches.  mind you, we were in vegas for only 3 days.  we both love the <mark>Chipotle <mark>Chicken Bacon Avocado</mark></mark> sandwich the most.", 
            "wanted to try this place without waiting in line for 3 hours in downtown disney. so we stopped by while in vegas! shared <mark>The Full Montagu </mark>, <mark>The Original 1762 </mark>, caprese and italian. omg... so good, the bread was perfect! crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside! also had the tomato soup which was really good as well! went on a monday, noon time, and wasnt a long wait. this is definitely a must have if ur in vegas :)", 
            "hello yummy sandwiches! i've heard about this place from some friends and i've been meaning to try it. i have actually tried their other location back in the oc but i've been wanting to come here for so long!\n\nwithout further ado - i would have to say that the sandwiches here are definitely better than the anaheim location. however, sandwiches from both place are still delicious! i had <mark>The Original 1762 </mark> and the roast beef was to die for. and the horseradish added a nice *kick* to the sandwich. i ordered a small tomato soup and it was just as good.\n\nmy boyfriend ordered <mark>The Full Montagu </mark> and it tasted yummy! in my opinion, not as good as <mark>The Original 1762 </mark>, but nonetheless, still a good sandwich to eat.\n\nwhat else do i like about this place? it's open 24/7!!!! ****", 
            "earls!!!!!!!!!!! you cant wander around the strip without getting a piping hot sandwich from earls. these sandwiches are like crack....cant get enough. i dont know if its because of the bread or bc i partied so hard the night before but these sandwich are to die for. i usually get <mark>The Original 1762 </mark> - roast beef, cheddar and horseradish spread. the toasted meat with the melted cheese and the spice of the horseradish is a perfect combination of deliciousness \n\nsandwiches are around 6-7$ which is a steal for eating on the strip. one sandwich usually fills me up but i usually order an extra for late night munchies after a night out. and if you didnt take my advice about ordering extra, earls is open 24 hours so you can get toasted sandwiches all day!!", 
            "i managed to convince a friend group of foodies to eat here while in vegas. 3 times that trip. whoooooo favs are the <mark>Holiday Turkey</mark>, <mark>Chipotle <mark>Chicken Bacon Avocado</mark></mark>,  and <mark>The Original 1762 </mark>. also a fan of their tomato soup, which tastes just like campbells so it's kinda a nostalgic flavor", 
            "another popular and raved about sandwich joint i've heard so much about. and after seeing my gf's always post pictures of their sandwiches i had to try it out. but couldn't soak up the whole experience since i had a protein bar an hour before and was trying to avoid eating heavy since were going to go clubbing afterwards. yes a very girly thing but hey, got to fit in my dress! just tried a few bites here and there. went both friday and saturday and wanted to go back again. something about the packaging reminded me of willy wonka's golden ticket that are hidden in the chocolate hahah. can never get enough. please come to la earl!\n\n_<mark>The Original 1762 </mark>, roasted beef, cheddar and horseradish sauce was pretty good. i loved the horseradish sauce! it really made the sandwich stand out. although a little too much meat for me. \n_<mark>The Full Montagu </mark>, roasted beef, turkey, swiss, cheddar, lettuce, tomato, and mustard sauce was one big juicy bite. although it seemed a little too cheesy. i think either swiss or cheddar would be good but having both was a bit too rich for me. but i'm sure most like a whole lot of cheese. luckily the small amout of lettuce and tomato helped a bit.\n_<mark>Chipotle <mark>Chicken Bacon Avocado</mark></mark>, grilled chicken, <mark>Bacon, Egg <mark>Ham 'N' Cheddar</mark></mark>, avocado, lettuce and chipotle sauce was my favorite. the chipotle sauce was great and not too overdrenched. every bite was better and just melts in your mouth. \n_baja chicken salad, romaine, grilled chicken, cheddar, cilantro, avocado, <mark>Tomato</mark>, roasted corn, black beans, tortilla strips, and red wine vinaigrette was refreshing. the salad was a bit small of a portion but not bad. nothing amazing. but good to share with a friend and half a sandwich. \n\ni would definitely come back and this time make sure not to eat any protein bars beforehand haha. and wear a more loose dress. can't wait to go back and try the other sandwiches!", 
            "wow this place is sooo amazing. well at the time i ate it, i was blown. away. <mark>The Full Montagu </mark> and <mark>The Original 1762 </mark> makes a good lunch! (not the hugest of sandwiches, unfortunately.) had the carribean jerk flavored one which i also enjoyed ahhh warm bread.\n\nnot a fan of the lines though.",

            "time for an update. again, the sandwiches are all really good. my favorites are <mark>The Original 1762 </mark>, pastrami rueben, italian, and i'm sure every single sandwhich that i'll try in the future.\n\nnow i yanked 1star for the personnel. we asked if there was cheese in a certain soup and a couple of them couldn't answer. seemed like an easy one to find out.  on another occasion, we asked to slighty customize our sandwhich and they seem confused and it didn't come out as we wanted.", 
            "definitely a must when visiting vegas! you really can't go wrong with earl. it's cheap ($6-7 for any sandwich), open 24/7, and there are lots of options to choose from. my favorites are the <mark>Holiday Turkey</mark> (it's thanksgiving in a sandwich!) and <mark>The Original 1762 </mark> 1762.\n\nthe bread makes all the difference! it is perfectly toasted. at the other earl locations, you can choose from white or wheat bread, but at the vegas location, they only have white available (probably to speed up the ordering process since lines can get long).\n\nas many others have said, it's perfect for lunch, after a drunken night out, or a quick snack. if you're especially hungry, you might want to order two. the lines can get a little long sometimes, but it's totally worth it.", 
            "so while checking yelp for some reasonable vegas fare, i came across a venue with like 3000+ reviews, 1 dollar sign, and 4+ stars.  check around, nothing else like it exists on the strip.  naturally, i had to go (mainly because i needed a break from $75 food bills for lunch).  \n\neos is good, really good.  there's a huge variety of sandwiches that are all delicious and easy on the wallet.  it's really close to about half the strip, and even if you need to take a $15 cab, you're going to save money in the long run.  there's a breakfast menu which is open until 11am (i never made it), but the rest of their hot sandwich menu suits me just fine. \n\ni had the <mark>Chipotle <mark>Chicken Bacon Avocado</mark></mark> thing, and later i had <mark>The Original 1762 </mark> 1786 or whatever.  <mark>The Original 1762 </mark> needed more sauce on the (the horseradish was great, but it needed more).  i got the chicken chipotle with extra sauce and it was awesome.  for like $7 a sandwich, you can't go wrong.\n\nnote:  the sandwich isn't huge.  i only needed one, but i don't eat a lot.  most dudes i hang with would need two to fill them up.  \n\nnote2: if you go for dinner, head into the ph and check out the pleasure pit.  you'll see.....",

            "it may be a little overhyped, but i love earl's. it's open 24/7 so it's great for late-night drunk food but is equally as satisfying sober. the sandwiches are about $7 each, so they're a little pricey given the size, but it's vegas..  the line can get pretty long so come at off-hours if you don't like waiting! there's a good amount of seating, but it gets packed easily, so chances are you'll be hovering over tables, waiting for people to leave.\n\ni don't think you can really go wrong with any of the sandwiches, but i do recommend eating them while they're still warm!\n\nmy preferences:\n     -<mark>The Original 1762 </mark> 1762 [roast beef, cheddar, horseradish sauce] - love the horseradish!\n     -italian [salami, capicola, ham, mortadella, mozzarella, tomato, italian seasoning, italian dressing] - lots of meat!\n     -<mark>Holiday Turkey</mark> [turkey, cornbread stuffing, turkey gravy, cranberry sauce, mayo] - tastes exactly like you'd expect\n     -the earls club [turkey, bacon, swiss, lettuce, tomato, sandwich sauce] - can't go wrong with bacon\n     -<mark>The Full Montagu </mark> [roast beef, turkey, swiss, cheddar, lettuce, tomato, mustard sauce] - pretty much a classic sandwich\n\ni've also tried the tomato soup. i'm not really a fan of the soggy croutons/bread in it, but the soup itself is pretty good.", 
            "so.... i have been here this past week alone about four times..#budgetinvegas. i've been here before and their sandwiches are always a hit. i have tried <mark>The Original 1762 </mark>, club, <mark>Chipotle <mark>Chicken Bacon Avocado</mark></mark>, <mark>Holiday Turkey</mark>, and <mark>The Full Montagu </mark>. my favorites have to be the chipotle chicken, original, and <mark>The Full Montagu </mark>... each sandwich is $7. it used to be cheaper... but still tasty! their sandwiches are not that big. you have to come here at least once while being in vegas. it will definitely help you save money esp being on a budget in vegas...\n\ntheir sandwiches are made fresh to order and toasted perfectly! each bite is so warm and just melts in your mouth. each ingredient in every sandwich compliments each other well. the service is fast! there is always a long line. better yet... they're open 24/7 !! come here when you're sober... drunk... sleepy... bored... hungry... or not hungry... you'll be craving. \n\ni have also tried their tomato soup and chicken noodle soup ! they're both pretty decent. it's about $2.99 for a cup and $3.99 for a bowl. soup always solves the problem in vegas...\n\ni haven't tried all of their sandwiches yet... but i will one day! \n\nearls has treated my wallet and tummy well this past week. until then !!",

            "when i went around 2pm on a saturday there was almost no line (score!...although even if there was a line they're super quick).  i lovedddd my chicken chipotle sandwich.  it was delicious, but kind of small.  for the price, i thought the sandwich would be a bit bigger.  my boyfriend got <mark>The Original 1762 </mark> sandwich and it wasn't really that great.  there was nothing special about it.  i would definitely go back for another chipotle chicken sandwich though.", 
            "well worth the wait.\n\nthis visit to earl of sandwich was two years in the making; this place was bookmarked 5/19/2013.  the first time i came to vegas in july 2013, i did not get the chance to eat here (time flies when you're having fun, i think janet jackson said that once).  nonetheless, i finally made the initial visit to earl of sandwich.  i remember it like it was yesterday: i was hungry, it was hot out, and i just brought a pair of tennis shoes (not important, but needed to be said).\n\ni made my selection very simple and straight to the point, i wanted <mark>The Earl's Club</mark> (turkey, bacon, swiss, lettuce, tomato, and sauce).  i ordered the sandwich, and then i waited.  now, the wait was not long at all, but you know how it is when you're stomach is frantically telling you to feed it; a couple of minutes then start feeling like an eternity.  then, bam, i had my sandwich.  a quick note before i continue, i did not have to suffer a long wait in line, probably because i came here during the morning hours (your experience might vary).\n\nto save the excruciating details of each bite into this sandwich, it was great considering the value. afterwards, i pondered the next sandwiches i wanted to try in the future.  those sandwiches include: <mark>The Original 1762 </mark> 1762, <mark>Tuna Melt</mark>,  ham & swiss, and the italian.  i'll definitely be back here when i touch down in vegas.", 
            "great sandwich. <mark>The Original 1762 </mark> 1762 is delicious and the roast beef is nice and rare just how i prefer it. made a delicious late night snack or lunch but sandwich is a little smaller for a whole meal.", 
            "this shop is located in planet hollywood right by the entrance to the mile shops. you place your order at the first counter. then you move down to the cashier where you get any additional items (chips, muffins, cookies, boxed salads, etc) and pay. fountain drinks, coffee, and lemonade are self-serve. there are several tables and bar seating which are typically full since it's a busy location. no outdoor seating since it's in the middle of the casino. open 24hrs. breakfast sandwiches before 11am. fairly quick service so double check your order because sometimes the order is incorrect.\n\nour order:\n<mark>Holiday Turkey</mark>: ($6.99) turkey, cornbread stuffing, turkey gravy, cranberry sauce & mayonnaise\nsea salt & vinegar kettle chips: $1.29\n<mark>Earl Grey Lemonade</mark>: $2.99\n\nbf's 1st time here (and almost the same for me since the last time i had it, i was a little kid & all i remembered was that i didn't care for it to much at the time). both the bf and i ordered the <mark>Holiday Turkey</mark> sandwich. their own artisan bread was toasted just right and wasn't too dense or dry. the stuffing was flavorful and the kind that's more on the wet side than the dry stuffing that i'm used to. not too much gravy to make the sandwich soggy (if eaten right away). the cranberry sauce was on the sweet side instead of the tart (which i prefer). the turkey are deli slices so they weren't dry but i would've preferred if they were thicker slices. overall a good sandwich. their salt & vinegar kettle chips went well with the sandwiches so i recommend getting a bag. the <mark>Earl Grey Lemonade</mark> was interesting but didn't have as much early grey flavor as i would've liked. bf didn't like the lemonade even though his tea of choice is earl grey.\n\n<mark>The Full Montagu </mark> and <mark>The Original 1762 </mark> are the popular sandwiches so may try that next time if i'm nearby since they are open 24 hrs.",

            "pros: it's earl of sandwich and delicious! honestly, the quality is just as good as the other earl of sandwich on the strip but i'm guessing this has so many more reviews and ratings because it was <mark>The Original 1762 </mark> (i think?). after <mark>The Earl's Club</mark> crawl, this was one of the establishments that was open and ready to take orders! so the accessibility is great especially when you have the munchies in vegas! i've gotten their warm sandwiches before and they are really good!\n\ncons: i would probably stay away from the thai wrap as it is a bit too sour (vinegar?) for me so it wasn't that tasty. i should have stuck with their earl of sandwiches next time.\n\noverall: great spot to get some food at any time of the hour! plus you don't have to tip making this meal on a budget in vegas!", 
            "my girlfriends and i love earl's! one of my girlfriends makes it a point to always come here whenever she is in vegas, although they have opened in socal where we are from. \n\nyou can't go wrong with <mark>The Original 1762 </mark> (roast beef with horseradish) on wheat bread to keep it healthy, with tomato soup to compliment it. anyone who has that creamy tomato goodness agrees that earl's tomato soup is one of the best they have ever had! the tomato soup also comes with a few chunks of bread inside.\n\ni actually think the carbs are worth it here ;). plus it's 24hrs and even better when you are drunk!",

            "usually <mark>Tuna Melt</mark> are disgusting - too much melted cheese which covers up the taste of the actual tuna part, it tastes all fattening and you feel gross in the end. but being a pescatarian, i only had one option - the <mark>Tuna Melt</mark>.\n\nto my surprise, it was the best <mark>Tuna Melt</mark> i have ever had. there wasn't too much cheese that it overpowered the sandwich; i could taste the tuna and it was light and flavorful, which was a new experience for me; and the best part was the bread - delicious, the right texture, and enhanced the greatness of this sandwich overall.\n\nin vegas, i know i'm gonna spend  and lose a lot of money because i'm a terrible gambler since slot machines are so hypnotizing and i'm the unluckiest person you would ever meet, so this sandwich helped me stay fed in vegas - its very affordable, especially by las vegas standards. i came here for multiple meals because of that and it was close by to the paris, which is where i was staying (it's in planet hollywood.)\n\nif you gotta eat, but you wanna save as much money as you can for the tables, come here for a quick bite.\n\n5 stars!!",

            "wow.  i rarely say \"wow\" after eating a sandwich, but i found myself saying it after every bite of my delicious <mark>Tuna Melt</mark>. \nmy sister had <mark>The Earl's Club</mark> sandwich, and my brother had the ham and cheese- and as simple as these items are- i heard a \"wow\" escape from their lips as well.  their artisan bread is so fresh and that is what makes the difference. \n\nthe price is very reasonable, and the portions are filling and satiating.  can't wait to return and try another item from the menu.", 
            "this place just beats any sandwich place i have ever eaten and for the price of 5.99 a sandwich just makes it a 5 star sandwich place. the bread is really crisp on the outside and the bread inside is moist and fluffy. i had the caribbean jerk, <mark>The Earl's Club</mark>, <mark>Tuna Melt</mark>, <mark>The Full Montagu </mark> and more. i thought they were all pretty good, but my favorite would have to be the caribbean jerk. full of flavors!! this is one place you just  have to try if you're on a budget or in a rush!",

            "hands down the best sandwich i have ever had in my life! i couldn't wait to get back home from vegas to write this review. i stayed at the monte carlo and i was walking around with the group i was with. they wanted to do some shopping in planet hollywood and i was hungry, but didn't want to eat anything that i have back at home. i stumbled across this place and saw the different types of sandwiches they had. when i got up to the cashier, i asked him how big the sandwich was b/c 5.99 is a pretty good price for a sandwich. for someone that eats a lot, their 6 inch subs hit the spot. i got a <mark>Tuna Melt</mark> and have been hooked ever since. i saw a sign that they were 24 hours, so what did i do when i was hungry after a late night clubbing adventure? i made a earl of sandwich run...lol. i've only tried their <mark>Tuna Melt</mark> and can't say enough about the sandwich. their oatmeal raisin cookies were pretty awesome too. i'm really upset that the nearest location to me is in orlando, fl. they're in really random locations and i wish they built one here in charlotte, nc. they would do well here and run jersey mikes/quiznos/jimmy johns out of business. \n\nearl of sandwich for the win!!!!!!!!!",

            "tis true.  hail to earl of sandwich.  this mighty establishment has made a fine addition to our meals at all hours around the clock.  from the late night munchies of a montague to the early morning hangovers of a <mark>Tuna Melt</mark> dipped in brocolli cheddar soup. \n\nand when there is no piling wait out to the slot machines...you'd be a damn fool for not taking advantage of that opportunity.  \n\nbest part: it's less than $10 for your soup and sandwich!  try getting that kind of treatment anywhere else on the strip.  it's a rarity", 
            "the sandwiches here are awesome. there are many choices, and everyone will be pleased if you come here. also, the price is right. some small complaints would be that the bread is equivalent to the bread served at subway - they just toast the outside a little bit. yet again, minor complaints. also, the salad is not as fresh as possible, and some of the lettuce had brown spots. \ni highly recommend the <mark>Tuna Melt</mark>, <mark>The Earl's Club</mark>, and the cannonball. also, the tomato soup as a side is delectable. \nif you are looking for a delicious sandwich during your time in vegas, this is the place to go. it is also open 24 hours, so it would be the perfect late night snack!", 
            "dont get me wrong, enjoyed the food at this place but i do believe it was over-hyped. i ordered the <mark>Tuna Melt</mark> with chicken tortilla soup and my bf ordered sthing else i forgot (sorry!) although the <mark>Tuna Melt</mark> was delicious i just didnt think it was worth the 6bucks just b/c it wasnt amazing in my opinion and for size was a lil much. even though yes it is a bargain for food on the strip...and 3bucks for barely a cup of soup? gees...and there was hardly any chicken in this soup...but! it did taste good, i just wouldnt get it again. the people there are rude or seem just tired out...im sure theyre sick of tourists but cmon now if im saying \"hello and thank you\" to you when you never said either of those to me first...yeah sthings wrong there.\n\nanother day later during this same recent trip to vegas, my bf and i went clubbing at tao..and of course i was one...drunk, two- tired as fuck, three- hungry...so we had to resort to earl's since it is in our hotel and its open @2am. these two black chicks in front of us came back from clubbing as well (and i know this b/c when we girls are carrying our heels and walking around barefooted..its from clubbin')..the cashier was flirting with them and i was getting annoyed bc i was fucking tired, drunk & hungry...and here is this dude with his mini dreadlocks tryna spit game while myself and the line wrapping around the corner are tryna get our food! poor guy didnt get a 2nd look nor their #'s haha. so when we were finally next, we ordered one jerk chicken sandwich and a cup of chicken noodle soup. i know why did i order soup again? because for me it cures some of my drunkyness for an hr haha. plus i also wanted to see if another of their soup could redeem itself. jerk chicken was ok, wasnt amazing like some people had mentioned..i would say the red peppers helped that sandwich's ass out in making it taste at least good. soup was better than the tortilla soup surprisingly.\n\nnot saying its not worth the try, just dont expect so much from it :]", 
            "got 4 different sandwiches and split it up among 4 of us. \n\nall of them were excellent. i didn't bother moving out anything i didn't like and just ate it, which i rarely do. \n\n<mark>Tuna Melt</mark> and original are really worth trying out. \n\nprice is great especially in vegas.", 
            "oh my f'n god! i'm already home and the thought of this place is still making me organism... i mean orgasm!\n\nfinally i got to try the famous <mark>Tuna Melt</mark>. i don't know what it is, but its so damn tasty. i've never had a <mark>Tuna Melt</mark> blow my mind before. when i went back to earl's on the second day, i told myself i was going to order something else. and as soon as i got to the register the words \"<mark>Tuna Melt</mark> w/ tomato\" came out of my mouth instantaneously.\n\ndon't let the line scare you. they get it moving really fast.\n\nearl's of sandwich, you have seriously changed my life. i will be back for sure!", 
            "after reading a yelp review about this place i knew i had to try it. and since i was staying in planet hollywood, it was the perfect opportunity! true to the reviews, this place serves up big sandwiches for very good prices (less than $10). i got the <mark>Tuna Melt</mark>. oh man they stuck a huge chunk of gruyere in there and even got it to melt! awesome! i only finished half of it in one sitting. and it was still yummy 4 hours later. i came back the next morning for a muffin. you know this place is good since there is always a huge line out the door!", 
            "so after you decide you need to sober up from inebriation, come here and get yourself damn good sandwich(es). we tried the caribbean jerk and <mark>Tuna Melt</mark> and both were fantastico! i would definitely like to go back and try their other sandwiches. pretty inexpensive (for vegas). there was kinda a long line, but it moves fairly quickly.",

            "with 1,320+ reviews at 4.5/5 stars --though in my opinion, deserves more --, does it live up to the hype?  absolutely!\n\nfirst time i tasted earl's sandwiches was at downtown disney in florida.  after an exhausting all-day visit at magic kingdom, we decided to call it the day but not before heading to downtown disney where we discovered this gem and became a believer that there is a sandwich maker who would topple the likes of quiznos, togos and all the others.  at last, a sandwich establishment worth writing about.\n\nmy very first earl sandwich was the rueben and it was delectable (i don't think they still have it on the menu) ; made me forget the whole day of walking that i endured.  from that day, i vowed to seek this establishment back home in california but quickly discovered its non-existence. sad days indeed.  then one day i was relieved when i heard that las vegas opened up a franchise. \n\non my much anticipated return last month, i indulged on the goodness of <mark>The Full Montagu </mark> and <mark>Tuna Melt</mark>.  both of which are hot sandwiches and are scrumptious. did it live up to the hype once, twice, thrice, etc?  abso-earlutely... \n\na satisfying end to a weekend vegas getaway.",

            "this place is hands down the best thing that ever happened in vegas. okay, i'm being a little overly dramatic, but every time i go to vegas, which is pretty often nowadays...my friends and i have to go here! we usually go here right when we get to vegas, after some late night clubbing, and right before we leave vegas.\n\nits cheap. fast. good. this place is pretty much always crowded, but its fast. my favorites here are:\n-earl of clubs\n-<mark>Tuna Melt</mark>\n-broccoli and cheddar soup: amazing!\n\ngenius of them to be open 24 hrs! i wish they would open a location in oc !",

            "okay, so it's just a freaking sandwich.  i know people say that it's over rated and well yeah, it is a bit over rated but it doesn't warrant the 1 star review.  actually, there's no need for me to even write a review because this place has at least a few thousand.  so why did i give 5 stars?  because look at where you're at.  vegas is like a giant airport where the food is jacked up to 60% of the actual retail price.  i bought a slice of pizza and a coke one time somewhere and had to pay 12 bucks. yeah, 12 motherfucking bones.  so let me tell you that earl of sandwich earns the 5 stars because for a pretty delicious fuckin sando, you only pay 6 dollars in a land where they would usually charge 12.  so there's my blurb right there.\n\nline is pretty long, but it goes by fast and you rarely wait more than 5 minutes to get your order.  not only that, the process of ordering to paying to getting your sandwich is so streamlined and smooth- there's no kinks to the process which is why they can go through so many people so fast.\ni ordered the <mark>Tuna Melt</mark> and it was decent- i really like their bread and the portions were good.  a half would have satisfied me but i went ahead and ate the other half because i'm to lazy to carry it around with me.  \n\noverall - not the best sandwiches in the world, but they're still good and you get the most bang for your buck here.  plus, the joint is open 24 hours.", 
            "best <mark>Tuna Melt</mark> ever! anywhere, hands down!\n\nladies and gentlemen, there are few things in life that are worth driving hundreds of miles for, amongst them is earls. \nfor those of us who are not 21, there are very few activities we can enjoy in vegas. fortunately earls is friendly to patrons of all ages. (although you have to hurry if you enter through the planet hollywood entrance; try and use the miracle mile shop entrance to avoid being harassed by pit bosses and the like.) \ni have tried their house sandwich and roast beef, both of them taste alright. but the <mark>Tuna Melt</mark> is absolutely perfect, i really mean perfect. you can make no amount of spices or make any other adjustment to that sandwich which will make it taste any better! \n\npros: \n*best <mark>Tuna Melt</mark> in the us. maybe the world.\n*price (~$6)\n\ncons: \n*long lines.", 
            "delicious! worth the wait for sure! my hubby and i got <mark>The Full Montagu </mark> and <mark>Tuna Melt</mark>..wasn't disappointed at all! actually surprised they're open 24hours.  i will totally come back again!", 
            "yay to a delicious easy eat in vegas!  forget the vegas buffets and michelin star promises of fine dining -- after all that drinking and partying, what you really want is a hearty meal that will hit the spot.  thank god for earl of sandwich!\n\nnothing fancy, but i promise the $5.99 sandwiches are just what the doctor ordered.  we tried several in the group, the best was the <mark>Tuna Melt</mark> followed by <mark>The Full Montagu </mark>.  despite the line, it's really a short wait.  sandwiches come out piping hot and seating was not difficult to find.  loves!\n\none last tip = get the brownie ice cream sandwich ($3.29) -- a scoop of ghiradelli vanilla ice cream between 2 huge chewy brownies, what a treat and a steal.", 
            "this place really doesn't need my review but i added a picture so.. might as well..\n\ngreat sandwich spot at the miracle mile shops in planet hollywood.  line is long but they have a pretty efficient check out process.. order with one person and pay with another.  i got the <mark>Tuna Melt</mark> and it was stringy, melty, cheesy richness.  although by the end of the sandwich, i felt a little heavy.  the lemonade washed everything down nicely, though.\n\nyes i recommend... holler", 
            "omg, i love this place!!!!!!!!! i tried earl for the first time this past weekend and right now, i am seriously having earl withdrawal. let's just say.. i was only in vegas for 2 days and i ate here 3-4 times. it was that good. and the line may be long, but it was totally worth it cuz it moves fairly quickly.\n\nanyways, so i tried <mark>The Earl's Club</mark>, <mark>The Full Montagu </mark>, <mark>Tuna Melt</mark>, and the breakfast one with eggs and ham.. all were freakin delicious. i honestly don't think you can go wrong with their menu.. everything is just really good. it may just be a sandwich, but to me, it was like the perfect sandwich. i think the bread made it extra melt in your mouth good. it's pretty cheap too! $5.99 a sandwich and i believe it's open 24/7!\n\ni tried looking up their locations to see if there were any near my area, but the closest one is vegas.. sucks! but if you're in vegas, make that visit over to ph and try earl of sandwich! you surely will not regret it! =)", 
            "it's 12pm. you just checked out of your hotel, only after realizing you left behind your hair curler and one of your heels. you had no time to shower and you look like a mess. \nhop over to planet hollywood for some sandwiches to save the day. these delicious toasty 'wiches won't break your bank...only $6 per sandwich! where else can you find a better deal on the strip?! add a cup of soup and you're bound to instantly start feeling better. highly recommended are <mark>The Full Montagu </mark>, <mark>The Original 1762 </mark>, and the <mark>Tuna Melt</mark>. the line is long but it goes by quickly.", 
            "call me crazy but my favorite sandwich so far is the <mark>Tuna Melt</mark>! haha the cheese that is melted within the sandwich is freakin delicious, i think we ate here like 2-3 times during our last stay since we were staying at planet hollywood, i know right? kinda embarrassing but whatevs so good!", 
            "i really enjoy earl of sandwich.\n\nfirst and foremost, i love that their soups are only $2.99.\ni am a huge fan of tomato soups and they have a very good tomato soup with croutons.\neos is generally a rather affordable food compared to nearly everything else on the strip.\n\nstrangely enough, kalila and i both wanted soup today. we went to earl of sandwich for some broccoli cheddar. it was a very heavy soup. it was good and tasty. i would have liked some more broccoli chunks though.\n\ni had a <mark>The Full Montagu </mark> and it was delicious. i really liked the roast beef and the mustard.\n\nkalila had the canonballs and it was also delicious. the sauce seemed to be all over the sandwich wrapper instead of the meatballs, though. overall, it was kind of dry. \n\nwe like that the bread is toasted, but after reading misti's review, she makes a great point about how there are no other bread choices.\n\nbased off of the other times kalila has eaten there:\nshe highly recommends getting a <mark>Tuna Melt</mark> sandwich and a tomato soup. eating them together is reaaaaaallly good!\n\noh, and!\nyou can order a <mark>Earl Grey Lemonade</mark>. it's grey <mark>Iced Tea</mark> and lemonade. basically, an arnold palmer with a different type of <mark>Iced Tea</mark>. whether or not you like it, depends on your taste buds. i know people who love it and people who can just tolerate it. it is something that they fill your cup behind a wall, but refills are free if you ask at the pick up area. just try it to see if you like it or not.\n\n#foodcrew", 
            "want cheap and delicious food? well, this is the place to be! recommendations:<mark>Tuna Melt</mark> and caribbean jerk chicken, hands down. can't wait until it opens in california!!", 
            "delicious hot- sandwiches for $5.99? are you kidding me? of course, i am a fan!\nlocated in planet hollywood, every time i am in vegas, my friends and i make a stop (or two) here.  although it is opened 24 hours,  there is always a line to order food (even longer during the daytime, of course) and people eating at the restaurant. the lines move at a fairly fast pace and the food is usually out and ready by the time you pay! what more could you ask for? my favorite sandwiches are the: caprese, <mark>Tuna Melt</mark>, and <mark>The Earl's Club</mark>!!\n\neven better news... for all the socal residents: earl of sandwich is opening in summer 2012 at downtown disney! i am soooo excited to head over there once it opens!", 
            "mmm.. i'm wanting another <mark>Tuna Melt</mark> just thinking about writing this review! *droool! ahh! anyways..\n\nlocated in the miracle mile shopping center (closest to the casino!), this place is definitely a gem! for just 5.99$ you'll get yourself a delicious sandwich (their sandwiches are kind of a panini/subway mix) of your choice and you can't really beat that unless you step off the strip! \n\nit was not busy when we went (2pm-ish?)\n\nthe food: i tried the \n+_caribbean jerk chicken (it came with chicken, red/banana peppers, and spicy jerk sauce.) it was alllllright.. it was exactly what i expected but nothing that would keep me ordering more.\n+_<mark>Tuna Melt</mark>. (albacore tuna with aged swiss.) omg! must try. my boyfriend and i ended up getting an extra sandwich to split for the drive home and b-b-boy am i glad that we did! i had it when we got home and that aged swiss really really makes the difference! it just raised the bar for future <mark>Tuna Melt</mark> from anywhere else!\n+_<mark>The Earl's Club</mark> sandwich (turkey, bacon, aged swiss, lettuce, and <mark>Tomato</mark> dressed with sandwich sauce.) this was the boyfriend's sandwich and i was lucky i got to take one bite! haha he was finished with his sandwich wayy before i was!\n+_<mark>Potato Salad</mark> ($2) it was mehh. it was missing something.\n+_macaroni salad ($2) too muchh mayo for me.. another meh.\n\ni can't wait to try all the other sandwiches!", 
            "i always get the <mark>Tuna Melt</mark> here whenever i am in vegas or when my boyfriend is in vegas. super yummy. consistent taste. \nwhen you go, there will probably be a line, but don't worry you probably won't be in line for long because the staff at earl's works fast! def try this place when you are in the area!\ni can't wait until the location at disneyland opens", 
            "so good for a sandwich spot! i usually stick to \"<mark>The Original 1762 </mark>\" which is the roast beef sandwich, because i love it so much! my friend loves the <mark>Tuna Melt</mark>. but i doubt any of their other sandwiches would be a disappointment. although there is a line most of the time, it goes by fast and there are usually always some open tables. vegas sandwich at its best!", 
            "earl of sandwich...mmm...so good...\n\nwe live in a time when most everything is all about the hype and thus marked up several times in vegas, especially on the strip.  what a wonderful feeling it was to discover this casual sandwich spot located inside planet hollywood.   it is quick, easy, delicious, satisfying and cheap!!!  $5.99 for any sandwich, wrap or salad! yes, true!\n\ni love love their blt.  the caribbean jerk chicken sandwich and <mark>Tuna Melt</mark> are also very popular and delicious.  it's their warm, soft bread that really steps their sandwiches a notch above most others. their salads are not so good so unless you're seriously allergic to bread or something, try a sandwich. \n\nbest of all, it's open 24/7 as it should be in this town!",

            "sandwiches get no closer to perfection than the ones at earl of sandwich.\n\non my last visit to vegas, we made treks to earl of sandwich after clubbing at tao and marquee on two different nights. true, i was drunk off my ass both times, and so that could have greatly influenced my love for each bite of my sandwich. but, honestly, my measure of earl's greatness is that i actually remember each delicious bite in what was otherwise a night of blurry flashbacks. i can still taste my <mark>Tuna Melt</mark> sandwich, even to this day, and it brings back such fond memories of a time when life was truly great.\n\nadditionally, i brought back a caribbean jerk chicken back to my hotel room, passing out before i could touch it. i woke up the next morning, hungover and hating life -- the last thing i could think about was food. however, i took one bite of that cold caribbean jerk chicken that was sitting out for over 8 hours in the hotel room and even that was damn delicious. \n\non my third visit (in the same weekend to earl's), i got the caribbean jerk chicken sandwich again since i wanted to try it how it was intended (hot and crispy). it went amazingly well with my bowl of tomato bisque.\n\ni'm the type of person who strives to try new places all of the time. if i'm in vegas for 2 days, then i will make it a mission to try a new place every meal. i very rarely ever go back to the same place twice in the same week, let alone the same 2 days.\n\nearl of sandwich is so good that i not only ate it 3 times in the span of 2 days, but i was craving it all the way home. now that is the only indicator you need to let you know that you've stumbled upon something phenomenal.", 
            "i'm not a huge sandwich person... but you wouldn't know it whenever i stay at planet hollywood.  i literally want eos for every meal.  the bread they make and use is so fresh and perfect with every sandwich.  a smaller bun is used for their breakfast sandwiches... but hits the spot, all the same.  \n\ni've had the following: \n- the ultimate <mark>Grilled Cheese</mark>\n- the <mark>Tuna Melt</mark> with swiss (i request for them to add lettuce and tomato... no extra charge!)\n- <mark>The Earl's Club</mark> with turkey and bacon\n- <mark>The Full Montagu </mark> - roast beef and turkey\n- the <mark>Breakfast BLT</mark> (i request to add egg on mine... no extra charge!)\n- the caprese - they definitely don't skimp on the mozzarrella!  \n- the blt \n- the tomato soup\n\neverything.  and i mean everything above is delicious.  however, the <mark>Tuna Melt</mark> is my all time favorite.  $5.99 for a regular sandwich and $3.99 for a breakfast one... can't get a better quality meal for that price on the strip!  \n\nwish i ordered an extra one yesterday to have today while i drool and write this review...",

            "the bread.\n\nfor $5.99, you get a medium size oven cooked sandwich, but the size is deceiving.  the bread is pretty dense, and fills you up fairly well, as opposed to subway or quiznos which is all air.\n\nthe bread is crowning feature of the sandwiches.  it isn't cooked until you order your sandwich, and then your sandwiched it put through what resembles a pizza oven.  the bread is crispy along the edges, and yummy.\n\ni wish they put more filling, and more <mark>Veggie</mark>, though.  i ordered the jerk chicken, and my mom ordered the <mark>Tuna Melt</mark>.  it seems like it would taste must better if the ratio of bread to stuffing was more balanced.  they probably can't over-stuff it though, in fear it wouldn't cook completely.  \n\nwhen i come here again, i'm going to probably order the full monague.  the pictures of it look delicious.",

            "it's hard to give a sandwich place 5 stars, but this place is as close as it gets! i finally made my way here after all my trips to vegas, and i must say i've been missing out!! their bread is probably why their sandwiches are so popular. slight crisp on the outside but so soft and moist inside. it also helps that most of their sandwiches are full of cheese! my favorite! nothing better than melted cheese combining all the ingredients together. my friend actually recommended the tuna, and i was like what? who orders a plain old <mark>Tuna Melt</mark> at the most popular hot sandwich place?! well, i was proved wrong because their <mark>Tuna Melt</mark> was probably the best i've ever had. rich and creamy, and full of cheese! every bite had a long strand of cheese pulling apart, and i just couldn't get enough of it! even after finishing my <mark>The Full Montagu </mark>, i was stealing some <mark>Tuna Melt</mark> from my boyfriend. \n\nthankfully, the two of us ordered 3 sandwiches (because we're gluttons), and we were stuffed at the end. the third sandwich was the <mark>All American</mark>, and it was really good too! the cranberry sauce made it sweeter, and the roasted turkey was also juicy and tender! i actually preferred the <mark>All American</mark> over my <mark>The Full Montagu </mark>, but maybe it's just because i'm not a huge mustard fan. my friend ordered a tomato soup along with his sandwich, and it was too sour for him to finish. basically, just stick with the sandwiches! it called earl of sandwich, not soup! also, they're opened 24 hours!!! i can't think of a better place to go when you're hungry and drunk. it's seriously the best idea ever. definitely one of the highlights at vegas!",

            "best <mark>Tuna Melt</mark> ever.  i ate this all day erryday for three f****** days straight! story below.\n\ni went to earls and bought two <mark>Tuna Melt</mark>. ate one on the spot and took the other back to the room. woke up the next morning, threw half of it in the foreman grill (cause someone had the brilliant idea to bring one to the hotel room), heated it up, ate it for breakfast. then i went out during the day and came back. guess what?  waiting for me was the rest of the <mark>Tuna Melt</mark>! winner winner chicken dinner!!!! felt like i just hit the jackpot on the penny slots!\n\nlater that night, went back to earl's and bought two more <mark>Tuna Melt</mark>. can you guess what happened?", 
            "very efficient. line wasn't super long and even if it seems so,have no fear! order first, grab your bottled drink if you want and pay at the end. wait a few wih your buzzee and bzz it's out! \n\n<mark>Tuna Melt</mark> (albacore tuna salad + swiss cheese)= soooooo delicious. seriously... i have dreams about that sandwich!! and it's super filling without being too \"fishy\" lol. \n\nearls club ( roasted turkey, smoked bacon, swiss, letuce tomato sandwich sauce )= so fresh! very very flavorful sandwich that can't disappoint!\n\n<mark>The Full Montagu </mark> (roasted beef <mark>Turkey 'N' Swiss</mark> and cheddar letuce earl mustard)= my little bro really liked this sandwich. he just scarfed it down = sign of a good time!\n\nnotes: \n* veggie sandwich is a no no. not enough <mark>Veggie</mark> in that sandwich to keep you full. i felt like i was just ingesting carbs as opposed to vegetables and carbs. \n* don't expect a large sandwich! the sandwich sizes actually run kind of small. yes you are paying for good flavor, but you're also paying for the brand itself. \n* purchasing an earl of sandwich is an experience most people like to incorporate into their vegas experience. take it or leave it. \n\ni may be coming around again!! :) tehehe until next time!", 
            "yes people! it's that good good! always craving their sandwiches morning, night, late night, any hour of the day (i wonder if it's open 24hrs) ! after club spot to go to (other than pho). i've tried every sandwich except the caprese and veggie. my faves are the <mark>Chipotle <mark>Chicken Bacon Avocado</mark></mark> and <mark>Tuna Melt</mark>! out of this world sandwiches. you have to try it to know what i'm talking about!\n\ndarn, i want one now.", 
            "i like this place because it is open 24 hours, you get your food fast (even if there's a line), and its a really filling sandwich for $6.\n\ni get the veggie sandwich and my hubby gets the <mark>Tuna Melt</mark> and adds on a few free <mark>Veggie</mark> (lettuce, red onion, roasted red peppers, chipotle sauce), and avocado ($.99 upcharge).  both are excellent, flavorful sandwiches.", 
            "after reading great reviews for this place, i decided to give this place a try since i was already staying at the elara hotel.  \n\ni noticed that there's always a line for this place - a good sign.  however, the line moves pretty fast, so don't get discouraged.  i waited maybe 3 minutes for my order of 2 sandwiches.  my mom got the <mark>Hawaiian BBQ</mark> and i got the <mark>Tuna Melt</mark>.\n\nflavor wise, both sandwiches were excellent.  value wise, excellent for $6 each!  service wise, very fast and efficient!\n\nso why only 4 stars?  because both my mom and i had suffered the \"msg chinese food syndrome\" after eating here.  we were both still extremely thirsty after drinking lots of water.  we also felt so sleepy that we had to take a nap.  \n\nif you don't mind lots of msg in your food, this place is a great find!  it's cost effective and fills you up.", 
            "quite possibly one of the best sandwiches i have ever had. i had <mark>The Earl's Club</mark> but i also tried the italian, hawaiian, and <mark>Tuna Melt</mark>; all of which were absolutely delicious. the bread on the sandwich was magnificent and the meats were melt-in-your-mouth good. complement that with the $6 price of the sandwich and you have a winner.", 
            "super happy that i finally got to try earl's for the first time last month. definitely making it a must-eat for every vegas trip from now on!!\n\nthe group of us ordered and shared five different sandwiches (original, montagu, <mark>Tuna Melt</mark>, caribbean jerk chicken& hawaiian). all 5 were pretty good imo. <mark>The Original 1762 </mark> and caribbean jerk chicken were definitely my favorites. if i have to pick one, i would go for <mark>The Original 1762 </mark>! i love the horseradish sauce in it. it was tangy and complimented the roasted beef and cheddar perfectly! the spicy jerk sauce in the jerk chicken sandwich added a nice spicy kick and was outstanding as well.\n\ni also liked the bread of the sandwiches a lot. they soaked up the flavor of the filling well without being soggy at all. still retained a nice bite and chew!\n\ncan't wait for their new location in anaheim!( :", 
            "the sandwiches here are delicious! yummy and toasty. however, i gave it four stars because i was the second person to order my sandwich from a group of 13 girls yet i got my sandwich last! on top of that they never called my number because they forgot my sandwich was there. but the one guy that helped me behind the counter was nice and he apologize and said no one had told him the sandwich was there. i would come here about but probably won't order the <mark>Tuna Melt</mark> again because it seems like it took a while!", 
            "me and the fiance stayed at planet hollywood, we wanted sumthin simple... came here! the line gets long but depending what time you go, if you go late nite... expect a lil wait! ok so i got the cannon ball (meatball sub) bland tasting... thought it was going to be decent... it was just edible... i hate wasting food! my lady got the <mark>Tuna Melt</mark>... man o' man, oh so good! it's so freakin simple... nuthin fancy schmancy on the tuna itself, js a lil mayo n prob salt n pepper to taste! melted cheese and toasted bread! the tuna is great, don't taste like its from a can... well i wanted to redeem my sad choice from the first visit... so i got <mark>The Original 1762 </mark>! great hot beef samich with cheese and horse radish sauce! we tried 2 sides, the mac salad, n <mark>Potato Salad</mark>... potato was better than the mac salad.  the brownies are pretty good, moist... the best is the ice cream sandwich brownie... great! all in all, if you want a decent sub... this place is pretty good.", 
            "one sandwich to rule them all.... and in the darkness bind them... \n\nlocated in planet hollywood is earl's home of arguably some of the best and cheapest sandwiches, each one costs about $7. our group ordered the: \n\noriginal- 5/5= imagine a french dip sandwich with horse radish sauce, basically an arby sandwich on steroids \nmontagu- 4/5= tastes like an ordinary blt to me \ncaribbean jerk- 5/5= peppered chicken with a kick, love it! \nhawaiian- 3/5= tastes like a hawaiian pizza, unfortunately, i'm not a fan of sweet food so no tangy bbq for me \n<mark>Tuna Melt</mark>- 4/5=  tastes pretty ordinary to me, however, it is still pretty good, almost tastes more like albacore then tuna.\n\ndear king of sandwich whoever you are, move over because earl of sandwich is ready to behead you and claim himself the king of all sandwiches.   overall, shout out to eva i for picking this one out. now excuse me... (crouches over and holds onto original sandwich) \n\nmy precioussss.......", 
            "dangit!  i think i was too drunk to have noticed that they have <mark>Tuna Melt</mark>!  argh!  but i did have <mark>The Full Montagu </mark> with a creamy tomato soup.  i have to say that it totally hit the spot.  we got lucky because we were able to get a table for our large group pretty quickly....\n\ni thought at first that the samich might be overloaded because everyone who eats it is in a post-club, post-long-night-of-drinking state, so i saved half of my sandwich for consumption later.  although a little cold, it was still extremely good!  i loved my samich, every last bite of it.\n\nso if you're on the strip hitting this place up, post-club would be the worst time in the sense of how long the lines are, but hey, when you're hungry you're hungry, right?  but even then, the line moves quite quickly and we didn't have to wait too long.\n\nlet's just assume that any vegas strip restaurant has bad parking(it's the strip) and that you're walking in from some other location.\n\nservice - good enough for a sandwich shop.", 
            "i've been to vegas several times before but for some reason, i never stopped by earl's before. i finally did this last time and holy wow it was incredible. per everyone's recommendations here on yelp, i got the <mark>Tuna Melt</mark> and it hit the spot dead on. i'm not even a huge fan of tuna, but heck, you gotta hand it to earl's. they really know their sandwiches. earl's was so good that i went back once more and got their original roast beef (equally as heavenly).\n\nsure, vegas is home to hundreds of fancy eateries and bountiful buffets. but if you're on somewhat a budget, or you're stumbling home drunk from <mark>The Earl's Club</mark> (earl's is open 24 hours), or you just want some bombbbb sandwiches, you gotta try earl's. you won't regret it.", 
            "there's a reason why people get what others recommend. not i. i had to walk off the beaten path, and opted for the earls club. why!? i mean, it was still tasty, and positively yum if compared to other sandwich joints, but the tried n true sandwiches my family got were way better. yum yum yum. the <mark>Tuna Melt</mark> with a lil tabasco and mustard (to cut the fattiness of mayo) really sang. sang in my mouth. yum. cant wait till u guys come to the oc!", 
            "this review has been sitting here, even thou i felt there is something missing, but i want to empty some these drafts.  \n\ni'm really puzzled by such high rating.  i went there with my kids bc the good yelp reviews, but i couldn't be more disappointed!  \n\nthe main thing that bothered me was the smell.  i'm not a smoker, so it was very hard to sit in a smoke permeated place to enjoy my sandwich.  there seems to be a lot of smokers in this area on that day and no one seemed to be bothered by that.  \n\nsecondly, their sandwich tasted average, nothing caught my fancy.  maybe we ordered the wrong ones, i had <mark>The Earl's Club</mark>, the kids had  the <mark>Tuna Melt</mark> and meatball, we finished our meal as fast as we could before we were out of the breath.  so unless i'm happen to be in the area, i wouldn't trek on the hot pavement to come back during the daytime.\n\nthird, it's too busy. had to wait in line for a while to get the sandwiches.  it's centrally located,  so i reckon the location and price could be part of the reasons for it's popularity.", 
            "there are literally thousands of reviews extolling earl of sandwich as the finest (and most affordable!) place to have a sandwich on the strip.\n\nwhile all those reviews are indeed awesome, i'm going to talk about something else entirely: tomato soup.\n\nyes, tomato soup.\n\n(i've said it before and i'll say it again... the easiest way to make a snap judgement about a restaurant is by looking at the quality of its soup.)\n\nthe tomato soup at earl's is orgasmic.  in fact, it's the best damn tomato soup i've ever had.  it's rich, it's creamy, and it's packed with an incredible depth of tomato flavor.  it's topped with the most perfectly crisped croutons i've ever encountered (not too soft, not too hard).  one spoonful of this tomato soup and i was in foodie heaven ...\n\n... at 8:30am.\n\nyeah, i went to earl's for breakfast.  weird, i know -- but please don't hate.  it's actually a great place to go for breakfast.  there are no lines in the morning, and there's plenty of seating to go around.  in fact, it was only like 5 minutes between when i placed my order at the counter and when the little electronic plastic thingy started blinking and vibrating to let me know my food was ready.\n\nwhat to have with tomato soup at 8:30am?  <mark>Grilled Cheese</mark> wasn't on the menu, so i had the next-best thing: the <mark>Tuna Melt</mark>.  and, oh my god, this <mark>Tuna Melt</mark> was just as orgasmic as the tomato soup.  it was a fresh, delicious roll with piping hot tuna and a layer of beautifully melted cheese.  is there such thing as tuna bliss?  i think there is, and it's served up at earl's.\n\ndid i mention that all this food cost less than 10 bucks?\n\nhave i convinced you of earl's amazingness yet?  if so, get off your butt and walk -- no, run -- to the planet hollywood hotel as fast as you possibly can and start noshing on some of the best cheap eats in las vegas.",

            "i finally got to try earl of sandwich! the menu is a bit small, but somehow i feel like there's a sandwich for every kind of sandwich lover out there. i absolutely love warm sandwiches, and earl's does them well with their consistent, perfectly toasted bread. i definitely have no regrets eating earl's more than once during my stay in vegas.\n\nmy favorite sandwich would have to be the <mark>Tuna Melt</mark>, but <mark>The Full Montagu </mark> and earl club are also delish! the cannonball was just ok. i probably wouldn't get that again. \n\nif the line is a bit daunting, all you have to do is make a phone order and pick up your sandwich when it's ready at the cash register. no need to wait in that ridiculous line. even better, if you're staying in planet hollywood and you don't want to go out for a meal, you can make the call from your room and lounge around while you wait.\n\ni wouldn't go as far as saying earl's has the best sandwiches ever (perhaps that's the drunken vegas talk/hype), but they definitely do sandwiches right. it's a great way to get a quick and cheap meal when time and money are tight, which is pretty often while you're in vegas.\n\nunfortunately, it may be hard to find a place to sit, so beware if you came in a group of a bajillion people.",

            "i read the reviews on yelp, and was all excited to try this place.  so it's 1am on a rainy, thunderstormy night in vegas, but i press on to sample the earl's <mark>Tuna Melt</mark> sandwich.  i was craving a good <mark>Tuna Melt</mark>, and from the photos on earl's website, it looked like i was in for a huge, delicious sandwich.  not the case.  there was barely enough tuna on my sandwich to give it even a slight tuna flavor.  the bread was the main thing i tasted.  definately not the double-layer of tuna depicted on their website.  for $6.49, i felt i was overcharged.  \n\nto top it off, when i was done, i showed the photo of the <mark>Tuna Melt</mark> from their website to the manager (marc).  he said \"they sure make it look big on the website, obviously they're making it look like a lot more than it is\".  he then simply offered me a \"sorry boss\" and then turned and walked away, no offer to remake my sandwich, refund my money, maybe comp me a brownie or anything.  left with a bad taste in my mouth.  oh, and to top it off, they were repairing the floors in the seating area, and the workers were using blowtorches to heat up the vinyl flooring (looks like wood, but it's vinyl).  it gave off noxious odors while i was eating at one of the two available tables.  i definately won't be in any hurry to return, i've had much better sandwiches at the carnegie deli in vegas, and at gaglione bros. subs in san diego!", 
            "every time i land in vegas, i have to go here at least once to get my <mark>Tuna Melt</mark> fix. nothing can beat this place when it comes to simple sandwiches. ridiculously flavorful, ridiculously good. i've also tried the hawaiian and i love it as much as i love chocolate, and i love chocolate so it's pretty understandable why i love this place. i'm kind of sad they decided to open up an earls near downtown disney and don't get me wrong, i'm happy at the same time that they finally decided to open up one in california, but i'm just afraid it's going to turn into a mass produced franchise and i would hate that. my boyfriend loves to get <mark>The Full Montagu </mark> and <mark>The Earl's Club</mark>. if you haven't been here, you're definitely missing out.",

            "every other time before this current trip to vegas i would have given earl's 5 stars. let me explain...i am a regular here in vegas coming about almost every 2-3 months. earls is my go to place every single time. one being they are right within the hotel i stay at (planet hollywood/elara), two being they are 24 hours, and number reason being they are the best sandwiches on earth! the <mark>Tuna Melt</mark> and <mark>Hawaiian BBQ</mark> are my top choices while i do very much enjoy all the other kinds! trust me i want to give this place five stars but here is what got me to give only 4. this current trip that i'm on i haven't had the best experience...apparently since they are open 24 hours they need to \"refresh\" their system (registers and what not) which is totally understandable. but they pick the worse time to do that...12 am, the time that most are heading to earls! and it causes this 10-15 minute wait which feels like forever when you're hungry!!!!!!!!!!! another reason for me is that even during regular hours of the day the service seems to be so much slower. i find myself constantly having to repeat my order cause it seems like they don't pay attention the first 3 times and they just seem out of it...then down the line the sandwiches are prepared much slower than usual and i notice this is because the employees spend too much time laughing and joking around causing (from my experience) a bunch of errors in orders and it takes so long for it to be ready! and it can get very frustrating! despite the delay sandwiches seems to have gotten smaller as far as the filling it's much more less than it use to be. over all yes i will continue to be a regular here and always be. i love love love love earls here at the planet hollywood but there can definitely be improvements!!!!",

            "this place is perfect in so many ways. \n\nfirst of all...you're in vegas, where money has lost all meaning and last week's paycheck looks like the next few poker chips. naturally the ridiculously expensive food doesn't make things any better, especially if you're like my group of friends that likes to do (at least) one get-all-fancied-up dinner and a buffet or two. plus that entire smorgasboard of alcohol everywhere...what's the point in paying 10+ for lunch? that could be your next double down. or perhaps a last minute all-on-red. \n\nnow earl's is a life-saver. it's great sandwiches...i mean delicious when you're non-alchied, and even delicious-er when you're nicely alchied up. i got <mark>The Full Montagu </mark>, roast beef, turkey, brie, mmmm. and it's all for less than 6 bucks!!! less than 6 bucks. i was so amazed. this is much better than blowing 30+ at serendipitys for lunch. (they're great for dessert, not so much on food). it's right outside planet hollywood casino, which has prive...one of the better clubs and sometimes decent tables. they were not so loving this last weekend though. \n\nanyway, go to earl's for hangover food. go to earls for lunch, go to earl's for late night munchies, and go to earl's to sit down and get all those gamblin' jitters out of your system before you go back and blow next week's paycheck too.", 
            "solid 4 stars. i asked the cashier what they were known for and she recommended <mark>The Full Montagu </mark>. what made it amazing was the bread! it was toasted, so it was slightly crunchy. usually when i eat sandwiches i take off a little piece of bread since it's so filling, but this sandwich made me want to eat more bread. 4 stars because the inside was just roast beef with turkey and grey poupon. if you take out the bread, i don't think it would be as good.",

(meatballs, marinara, mozzarella & parmesan cheese), which was a little salty, but still delish when hot. then again, meatball sandwiches were never my thing.\n\nif like me, you need your sandwich with a side of soup, this place offers a few soups to choose from. i had the broccoli and cheese soup, which comes with oyster crackers if you ask for them. it had nice bite-sized chunks of broccoli and wasn't too thick.\n\nto finish it off, we tried the ice cream sandwich made with ghirardelli chocolate. the top layer of brownie was good, but the ice cream wasn't creamy enough and the bottom layer was cake, which felt kind of cheap.\n\nthe best part about it is that the prices are totally reasonable and comparable to national sandwich chains. the sandwiches are all $5.95 and soups $2.95. and don't think you're going to get cheated with a shot glass of soup. it was an honest bowl-sized portion, and definitely more than what you'd get at the other chains. in addition, it offers a variety of <mark>Fruit Cup</mark>, parfaits, <mark>Potato Salad</mark>, cookies, chips and the like. you can have a full meal for under $10 in vegas. unheard of!",

            "before i begin my review, a little yelp history lesson.  the name comes from the apocryphal tale about the earl of sandwich (an actual position of nobility in the uk).  it was rumored that the earl was gambling late into the night and in order to eat his meals at the table asked the chef to put the meat and vegetables between two pieces of bread. voila, the sandwich is born.  wikipedia doesn't mention this story and other sources on the subject say it's probably not true.\n\nnow you know why this place is called the earl of sandwich and why it's fitting that it's in a casino. \n\nthe lines for lunch on saturday afternoon tend to be long, but it's worth it.  all of the sandwiches, wraps, and salads were $5.99.  i also had a coffee that brought my total with tax to $8.50 or so.  i ordered <mark>The Full Montagu </mark>, which had roast beef in it.  the roast beef was much better than i would expect from a sandwich shop -- it was very juicy and was actual slices from a roast and not the typical deli slices (which has the potential to be chopped and formed odds and ends from the butcher).  \n\nthe sandwich is smaller compared with with a subway or quizno's sub, but the quality is infinitely better.\n\nif you're looking for a cheap lunch (or late night bite since it's open 24-hours) i'd recommend the earl of sandwich.  it's at the entrance of the miracle mile shops at the planet hollywood, so you can make a quick entrance/getaway if you don't feel like getting sucked into a mall or casino.",

            "i love this place!! its so good and in planet hollywood which is really convenient, but may be hard to find. all of the sandwiches there are great... and none of them disappoint me, but the one that stood out to me was the <mark>Tuna Melt</mark> !! it does look like a regular tuna sandwich at first, but when you bite into it. it tastes so good. i would also recommend <mark>The Full Montagu </mark>, blt, carribean chicken wrap, and much more....but i can't remember right now!the price is ok also... about $6 or $7 a sandwich. the potato soup is also really good, must try!!also, what i like about this place is that you can either have your salad in a tortilla wrap or in a bowl, and they both cost the same too! you must stop by this place before leaving las vegas! if only there was one in the bay area.....", 
            "one of the best sandwich shops i've ever been to!\n\nthank you, five hundy by midnight, for recommending this place at the planet hollywood casino!  they are either open late or 24 hrs, because we arrived after 2am and were able to order a sandwich.\n\ni started with <mark>The Earl's Club</mark> and tried the <mark>All American</mark> on the 2nd visit - both awesome, but <mark>The Earl's Club</mark> was better.\n\nmy husband started with the blt and tried the <mark>Hawaiian BBQ</mark> on the 2nd visit - both awesome, but he liked the blt better.\n\nmy other friend is in love with <mark>The Full Montagu </mark> and thought the soup was tasty as well.\n\ntheir unique brick-shaped tasty bread and their sandwich sauces make this place so good that now that we've returned home from vegas, we have looked up all other earl of sandwich locations and will make a special stop next time we go to one of those cities.,", 
            "this place is as good as it gets.  we stayed in vegas ph for 3days and 2nights and we must ate at earl's like 4 times.  \n\nfirst this place is open 24/7, so both nights after <mark>The Earl's Club</mark> in 5am we stopped by this place and got some sandwiches too good.  besides being open 24/7, the sandwiches are sooo good specially <mark>The Full Montagu </mark> sandwich.  that was the only one i tried, and it was so good that i didn't bother to try something else.  why was it soo good?  the bread was fresh, the meats were hot, and the tease was good overall.  \n\nohh the sandwich is only $6, it is way cheap for being in vegas.  oh and btw did i mention that the sandwiches are good as hell?", 
            "$5.99 for a great sandwich is such a steal in vegas. i can't believe of all my vegas trips, i've never come to aladdin/ph. with over 300 reviews, i'm so surprised no one's told me to come here before!\n\nwith the new city center sky bridges connecting aria to the ph, it's so convenient to walk across the street for a bite. its right at the entrance of ph and you can't miss it. there is plenty of seating around after you order at the counter. every sandwich is baked to order. i had <mark>The Earl's Club</mark> (roasted turkey, smoked bacon, swiss cheese, lettuce, roma tomato & sandwich sauce) which was awesome although \"sandwich sauce\" sounded questionable haha. my friend had the caribbean jerk chicken (grilled chicken, roasted red & banana peppers & spicy jerk sauce) which unfortunately wasn't very flavorful. <mark>The Full Montagu </mark> (roasted beef, turkey, swiss & cheddar cheese, lettuce, roma tomato & earl's mustard) is good too.\n\ni'd come back in a heartbeat!", 
            "there really isn't anything more to say that hasn't already been said.   heading to vegas for labor day weekend!  woo hoo!  party party?  well, yes that's a given.  but is it sad that one of the stops i am looking forward to making is the earl of sandwich?  24 hours a day 7 days a week of yummy sandwich goodness!\n\nbeen here at least four times and it has been consistently good every time.  and soo soo soo soo cheap!  can't believe i'm eating on the las vegas strip type of cheap!  my favorites - <mark>The Original 1762 </mark> 1762 (soo much roast beef), <mark>The Full Montagu </mark>, and the caribbean jerk chicken. i'm sure anything you order here will be great - but those are my favorites.  not just good at 4am when you're drunk, stumbling through the deserted miracle mile shops of ph (which, by the way-resembles some sort of zombie apocalypse 4am!) and still good at 5pm the next day before a night of drinking.  \n\nthe key is the quality of the bread, the meat, and sauces.  the competition needs to take a page out of earl of sandwich's playbook - quality over quantity.  generous portions of meat but not too much meat to overdo it. not like those other sandwich shops that just serve you the side of an animal piled up between two small slices of bread.  . earl of sandwich serves the perfect amounts of meat, sauce and <mark>Veggie</mark>.\n\nthe process is so streamline - the line may seem long but they have fulfillment down to a science so it moves fast.  place your order, listen for your number - done!\n\na word of advice - if you are a big eater - order two sandwiches.  i'm not saying they're small by any means - but they are soo good and go down so easily - you'll be craving another.  trust me.", 
            "ah, the inventor of the sandwich. (is he really?)\n\nat first, i was getting frustrated trying to find this place in  planet hollywood, but it was definitely worth the search. it's cheap, filling, and extremely good!\n\ni went to las vegas this past month and tried earl of sandwich for my very first time. i can't believe i was missing out on such an amazing sandwich! \n\nbefore i thought, \"it's just a sandwich\", i mean  how good can a sandwich possibly get? this, my dear, is as good as it gets. i'm sure this place steals pieces of heaven to put in their sandwich. \n\ni've only gone here twice throughout the duration of my stay in vegas and the sandwiches i tried were <mark>The Earl's Club</mark> and <mark>The Full Montagu </mark>. these are both winners in my book. \n\ni don't know how they do it but they put just the right amount of everything in these sandwiches. at first i thought the meat makes the sandwich or maybe a secret sauce but now i'm positive it's all in the bread. i may be mistaken but i think i had read somewhere that they don't bake the bread until you order it. is it possible to bake bread that quickly? \n\nwhatever their secret is, it definitely works and is well worth any wait you may experience. (i didn't have to wait long but i've heard the lines get pretty long).", 
            "we ate here twice. it is really cheap. there was quite a line but it moved fast.  got <mark>The Full Montagu </mark>, it was super yummy. i would say perfect for one person. the bread is soft and fresh. great sandwhich place like everyone says.\n\nwe came here again late night because nothing else was open and pink's was closed by the time we got out of our show.  this time we got the hawaiian. i would say it was not as good, but when nothing is open its still great to find a decent place to eat.", 
            "this place rocks!!! me and my girlfriends all got one sandwich and split it into 4 and each one tried one of the others. the four sandwiches were:\nthe caprese\n<mark>The Full Montagu </mark>\nthe <mark>Tuna Melt</mark>\nthe caribbean jerk chicken\n\nmy favorite by far was the <mark>Tuna Melt</mark>!!! i added lettuce and tomato to mine! amazing!!!! seriously the perfect texture! i felt <mark>The Full Montagu </mark> had great potential but the sauce (kinda sweet) really ruined it for me, next time i would request sauce on the side! the caprese was also really good! personally i would have liked the mozzarella slightly toasted but still amazing! lastly was the caribbean, i enjoyed it, tasted good...but compared to the others, i probably wouldn't get it again! i really want to try the <mark>Hawaiian BBQ</mark> next time! this place is amazing, cheap (especially for vegas) sooo worth going! the only bad thing was the 10-15 minute wait which was worth every bite!!!! :)\nthis place is awesome!", 
            "it's actually a 3 and a half stars but we gave it a four because it's vegas afterall....this sandwich place is opened 24 hours a day and it's pretty good price since it's located inside a vegas strip resort.\n\ni got <mark>The Full Montagu </mark> sandwich which was pretty amazing. (could use more meat though.) \nmy girlfriend got the earls club and she thought the sandwich was flavorful but was lacking in the onions and pickles department. this is why she would rather give this a 3 star. \n\none of the cons would be the location itself. it is not actually located in the miracle miles shops....its more like somewhere near the front of the casino so if you park inside their one and only parking structure, be prepared to walk for a bit.", 
            "<mark>The Full Montagu </mark> is absolutely the best sandwich i've ever had!! i introduced a bunch of friends to this yummy yet easy on your wallet sandwich. i love the fact that they have a bunch of variety from wraps to sandwiches to salads, soups, desserts, etc. i also love that $5.99 gets you a delishious meal in vegas. plus..its 24 hours!!!! only thing that i would have say disappointed me...they do not have avacado...i love avacado and wanted to add some onto my sandwich ..but they do not have it...but its still delishious!!",

            "first my stomach resisted, asking me, \"why are you shoving more food into me?\" when <mark>The Full Montagu </mark> hit my tastebuds and my stomach, it started thanking me instead of complaining. \n\nthe bread is delicious. i kind of wish there was more sandwich fiiling but what can i expect from an assembly line of teenagers? \n\ni also got the tomato soup with croutons. the <mark>Tomato</mark> soup was okay, creamy but had a metallic aftertaste (hence the -1 star). the croutons were amazing. soggy from the soup but still had a chew. amazing texture. \n\ncost was great too! $6 bucks for a sandwich and $3 for the soup. more money to gamble. wee.",

            "what fascinates my boyfriend the most about this is that it seems to be owned by descendants of the actual earl of sandwich, meaning that they, of all people, should know sandwiches. this always leads me to question how hard it really is to stick meat in bread and eat it... i mean, could humanity really have gone that long before coming up with such an idea? or is it that this guy, earl of sandwich, just proclaimed it first? \n\nanyway, i digress...\n\nthe kicker here is the bread- baked fresh and run through an oven with the toppings so that a crusty exterior and gooey interior can create magic in your first bite. \n\ni can always go for more meat and cheese in any sandwich, but for the very fair price of $5.99 per sandwich, i'm not complaining. so far, i've sampled <mark>The Full Montagu </mark> (#1 for me), <mark>The Original 1762 </mark> (#1 also for me, it's a tie), <mark>The Earl's Club</mark> (#3 for me), the italian (#4 for me) and the hawaiian (#5, but this will fall quickly as i sample the others- the sauce is too sweet for me). \n\nif you ever get the chance, order a salad. the croutons kick serious ass. \n\nthe lines can get long, but the staff runs through it quickly. you order from the sandwich/salad/wrap/soup menu first and are given a buzzer. from there you walk through a gauntlet of temptation- parfaits, <mark>Potato Salad</mark>, coleslaw, beer and wine, and a wall of desserts- before you reach the cashier and pay for your meal and anything you picked up on the way. when you hot food is ready, you're buzzed. i usually don't sit in my seat for more than three minutes before i get the buzzer of joy. \n\nduring my second visit, one register was down so the line was slow moving, but that actually caused my sandwich to be ready right when i paid- not so bad in the end!",

            "so freaking good! by far the best panini-style sandwiches i've had in a long time. i stopped by here twice within 6 hours, both for dinner and for a late night snack.\n\ntop 3 reasons that this place gets 5 stars:\n1) open 24 hours. a necessity especially in a place like vegas.\n2) tastes like a panini, but the bread is soft and doesn't rip up my mouth.\n3) cheap! when you're losing money at the craps tables, it's a very comforting thought that you can at least afford one last delicious meal in vegas.\n\n<mark>The Earl's Club</mark> and <mark>The Full Montagu </mark> were both amazingly delicious. for a vegas eatery, this place definitely deserves the crazy high rating.", 
            "tried their holiday sandwich this past weekend and absolutely fell in love with it. served on artisan bread with turkey, stuffing, gravy and cranberries. sounds like an odd combination, but it definitely works. bf ordered <mark>The Full Montagu </mark>, and said that it was good too. can't wait to go back to vegas to try their other sandwiches.", 
            "this is definitely a new favorite. they definitely know how to make a good sandwich....they do it well and to do it quick! awesome sandwiches, and at only $6.00 each, they are a steal for being on the strip in planet hollywood. i complain a lot when sandwich places jip you with too much bread, but here, the bread was the best part! it's a crispy, almost english muffin-type bread that's toasted, warm, and delicious. they do toasted sandwiches but quizno's would be the mere fly on the stick compared to earls. i had <mark>The Full Montagu </mark> sandwich and it was just off the chain! i honestly haven't had a sandwich that good in awhile. this place is a steal compared to some of the other high-priced places in planet hollywood and surrounding it. i will definitely be going back next time i'm in vegas again. i hope they get a franchise going here in texas!", 
            "i have a few must-stops in vegas. this has definitely earned a spot, thanks to <mark>The Full Montagu </mark> sandwich. i'd steer clear of the the holiday sandwich, though; it's just not as good as their other sandwiches. why hit subway, when for just $2 more, you can enjoy a quality panini from here? :)", 
            "this is my very first review after coming back from south korea! i got back 2 weeks ago.. and went to vegas for the weekend with the family, and i knew this would be a great opportunity to rack up some yelp reviews to make up for lost time!!\n\nso i drove in and went to the coveted earl of sandwich.. \n\nthis place is as good as they say! i tried 4 sandwiches and a soup thanks to my family, and we each got:\n\ncaribbean jerk chicken: mine! this was really good and spicy, with banana peppers and nicely grilled chicken. twas delicious.\n<mark>The Original 1762 </mark>: my mom/dad split this one..  we all really liked it as we exchanged sandwiches (benefits of having a family that loves variety :p) good roast beef! and <mark>The Original 1762 </mark> is a solid choice...no wonder why this place became so popular! \n<mark>The Full Montagu </mark>: my sister got this one.. and we all agreed that it was our favorite out of the 3... it had turkey? and roast beef... and cheese with lettuce.. delicious.\ntomato soup: it was like gourmet spaghetti-os... it was ok and had croutons, but i don't remember how much it was... i'd rather have gotten another sandwich.\n\nmy sister and i went for a second round...so we got:\n\nthe italian. this is by far our most favorite sandwich. this is the reason why you need to come here. i learned that mortadello was italian bologna, and it came with mozzarella, tomato, and it was good, good, gooooooooood!!!\n\noh, and the <mark>Earl Grey Lemonade</mark> needs sugar. nothing 4 splenda's can't fix. or you could just get a pink lemonade too.. \n\nthere's so much i wanted to try too! the meatball, hawaiian chicken, etc etc.. \n\nfood. fresh and hot.\nservice. quick.\n\neach sandwich i had was definitely worth $5.99. 5 stars. simple as that.", 
            "yummy sandwiches, good variety, well priced. this was on my list of places to try on this trip to vegas and i was fixated on it for a couple of days. when we finally got to it, we got a blt, an italian, and a <mark>The Full Montagu </mark>. all were really delicious, although not super filling. the brownie was also really yummy and kept me out of the sugar factory :)", 
            "happy 2011 everyone!  hope everyone had a terrific ny celebration (nothing crazy and unsafe, yet extremely awesome and entertaining!)  now the new year is upon us, let me start off with a 5 star review for ya'll!\n\nearl of sandwich... i've never really been a sandwich fanatic and this was all the rage prior to my recent last trip to vegas by everyone i know and all the reviews posted on yelp.  on the day we were going to be leavin' lv i've decided to give it a shot by walking across the street for a quick brunch at earl's.\n\noh boy am i glad that i did just that!\n\nyou know... sandwiches are sandwiches.. nothing spectacular but nothing too horrible either... (a very safe type of food).  however, here at earl's it's absolutely incredible on how they can possibly make things tastes so good!\n\nagain due to my typical curiosity and the irresistible temptation on trying new things,  i've decided to almost but the entire menu for my food tasting lab i've set up in bellagio.  (i end up getting <mark>The Full Montagu </mark>, <mark>Hawaiian BBQ</mark>, caribbean jerk chicken, and the earl cobb salad.)  the sandwiches were $5.99 each with a decent portion (ain't the size of subway but quality is much much better!), and with two drinks the total came out to like $31 and change...(slightly pricey in my mind but gotta give it a try)\n\ni did share all this food with 3 other people though,,, so i not really the pig that i say i am.....\n\nso here were our thoughts...\n\n<mark>The Full Montagu </mark>:  great roast beef sandwich with turkey and swiss cheese... the roast beef was the real deal and it had the texture of soft arby's roast beef..... so taking that soft morsels that you call beef coupled with high quality you get an awesome sandwich!\n\n<mark>Hawaiian BBQ</mark>:  i didn't get to try this as my friend devoured it down in a quick few minutes... so i'm gonna take that gesture as awesome and leave it as that!  \n\njamaican jerk chicken:  jerk flavored chicken + roasted bell peppers in a jerk sauce made this sandwich really really delicious!  that's all i can tell you!  yum!\n\nhighlights of these sandwiches, the bread!  they toasted in a way where it's just the right moisture, the right texture, the right flavor, the right crispiness, and the right size overall!  it's just a really delicious bread to compliment all the dressings in between!  i've always believed that what makes a sandwich great is simply the bread itself, and earl of sandwich really proved that to be the main point!\n\nearl cobb:  aside from having slightly too much dressing that i would have liked (i always watch my dressing calorie count as this is the main trick in getting a salad), it was absolutely delicious!  i've have had many salads in various places, i gotta say that this is one of the more tasty salads for a fast food joint.  definitely worth the price!  (the people i was with weren't even into salads and they really enjoyed that too!)\n\nit's sort of weird that if you want ice tea you have to ask for it.... but you got the typical fountain drinks available for you (pepsi products)\n\none final note.... this place has recently updated their operational hours and it is now 24 hrs!!!  wow!  that's so awesome!  so you're telling me when i'm hungry late at night working on them slots, i can get myself a sandwich to go, sit down at the slot, blackjack machine, or anywhere to be gambling and eating at the same time?  i love vegas!!!\n\nso there you have it folks!  the first review of 2011 by yours truly and it is definitely a 5 stars in my mind.  so again hope everyone will be having a super duper 2011 and if you do visit vegas, may the money gods follow you to every machine/table you go to, and the sandwich gods guide you to earl of sandwich!", 
            "amazing! best sandwiches hands down!\n\nwe were just here for nye and my friend introduced us to this place. i love sandwiches that aren't greasy and that aren't completely filled with bread. this spot is it!!\n\nthe bread is toasted and crunchy until the last bite, it's also very light and thin which doesn't make you feel super full. \n\nwe ordered <mark>The Full Montagu </mark> and italian w/a side of broccoli cheese soup = bomb! the roast beef in my montague sandwich was perfect and the soup was so yummy. definitely hit the spot.\n\ni also tried my friends cheese soup and that was really good too! i started dipping my left over bread in her soup because i couldn't get enough!\n\nwe're coming back here in two weeks and guess where we're going?! earl of sandwich duh! ;]", 
            "i make sure i hit earl of sandwich up at least once per vegas trip. \n\ni usually order <mark>The Earl's Club</mark> or <mark>The Full Montagu </mark>, but i'm going to go ahead and bet that the rest of the sandwiches on their menu are just as good. i'm foaming at the mouth just thinking about them. the ingredients are fresh. the bread is toasted to perfection. the sandwiches aren't all greased out so they feel relatively healthy to eat and you don't feel gross afterwards. sometimes i'll get a side of broccoli cheese soup w/ my meal. the soup is really good, but nothing special.\n\nthere's a long line? not uncommon. just shut your mouth and get in line. this is the perfect to place to go after a long night of drinking and dancing at <mark>The Earl's Club</mark>.", 
            "wow.\n\ntaking the recommendations from other yelpers, we ordered <mark>The Full Montagu </mark>, the caprese, a broccoli and cheddar soup, and an ice cream sandwich made with ghiradelli chocolate.\n\neverything was amazing. the roast beef was moist and complemented the turkey in <mark>The Full Montagu </mark>. the bread was nicely toasted, giving a nice satisfying crunch. the caprese had a balsamic dressing that tied the sandwich together in such beautiful harmony. next time i'll ask for the to warm or melt the cheese a bit more; i like my cheese gooey.\n\nthe broccoli and cheddar soup was like broccoli chunks in cheese soup, but somehow the flavors went well. and of course, how can you go wrong with ghiradelli?\n\namazing!! now i'm curious to see how it would've tasted if they used california sourdough's sourdough bread... *drools*\n~*~\ni couldn't help it. we came back the 3rd time this week and why not? at $6 a sandwich and open 24 hours its probably the cheapest good eats on the strip! here's what we've sampled so far in my preferred order.\n\n1. <mark>The Full Montagu </mark> - just perfect\n2. caprese - would order it extra melty next time\n3. holiday - the gravy, cranberry, and stuffing is like warm thanksgiving in my mouth\n4. original 1786 - classic roast beef and horseradish\n5. italian - nice flavors, but didn't jump at me\n\n<mark>Brownie Creme Sandwiches</mark> are like giant brownie oreos. must have.\n\nand if it's hot, the brownie ice cream sandwiches are just as good.\n\nsoups are good too, nice balance, not too salty and good chunky.\n\ndid i mention the <mark>Brownie Creme Sandwiches</mark> have ghiradelli chocolate chips in them? oh yeah....", 
            "okay if i could i would give this 24 hour place a 4.5 star rating and here's why.\n\ni ended up trying this place partially because i wanted to see what the best cheap eats in las vegas were. so i went there one day and grabbed a late lunch, and when i took my first bite it was absolutely wonderful. so much better than any sandwich i've had in canada. \n\ni love their <mark>The Full Montagu </mark> sandwich, it was tasty, delicious and of great value. (in canada are food portions are usually smaller than the u.s, so for me the sandwich was a good size.) the bun is always crispy but not hard so that it rips the roof of your mouth. (not a fan of hard breads) and the way that everything just melds is amazingly simple yet is a melt in your mouth experience that is hard to describe.\n\nduring my stay in vegas i ate there 3 times and each sandwich has always made my stomach smile. (i remember one was hawaiian, but i can't remember the 3rd). the only downfall is that if you are a bit of health nut then you may want to watch out for the sodium levels. i know they are quite high. \n\nbut what most people may not mention is that their salads are absolutely great for the price you pay. salads are never prepackaged and suffocating in a plastic container. they are made fresh and taste wonderful. the pricing of around 6 bucks for a salad is almost unheard of in las vegas. \n\nat the end if you're looking for a sandwich and salad meal for under $13 us, definitely go to earl. you can't get better value. \n\nconsidering what the cost of other meals in vegas are, this is a great place for bachelors and people who are with a family and budget conscious.", 
            "mmmmmmm earl of sandwich is seriously the best hot sandwich ever for $5.99!  i had <mark>The Full Montagu </mark> sandwich and it was mmmmm!  it was roast beef, turkey, swiss, cheddar, tomato, lettuce, and mustard.  delish!  the bf had the the earl club!  it had roasted turkey, bacon, swiss, lettuce, tomato, and the amazing sandwich sauce. there was something about how the sandwich was made. whether it was having the right proportions, or the ingredients used, or the freshly toasted bread, their sandwiches were just amazing.  if we weren't going on for a buffet later in the evening, the bf was seriously considering a second sandwich because of how much he loved it.  they also had kona coffee with free refills for $1.99~ awesome!\n\nif you want a cheap, amazing sandwich, this is the place!  actually, this is a good place for lunch anyways.  yum yum yum! thumbs up!", 
            "so where's the best place to pigout on the las vegas strip at midnight when all the buffets are closed and you don't feel like eating at a sit-down restaurant?  earl of sandwich!!  \n\nthis was my third trip to the sandwich shop and i can never get tired of their awesome sandwiches.  i was seriously hungry this trip and ordered two sandwiches this time: <mark>The Full Montagu </mark> and <mark>Hawaiian BBQ</mark>.  yes, earl of sandwich has officially become my las vegas equivalent to ike's place.\n\n<mark>The Full Montagu </mark> - freshly roasted beef, turkey, aged swiss & sharp cheddar cheese, lettuce, roma <mark>Tomato</mark> & the earl's mustard sauce (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=f_5_unx-wrafcxuakbzrdw&select=vumlfe1ytkyr8nntu3irfq) was everything i expected it to be.  a sandwich that's loaded with meat and has some kick to it.  it was very tasty!!\n\nthe <mark>Hawaiian BBQ</mark> -  grilled chicken, roasted ham, <mark>Hawaiian BBQ</mark> sauce, aged swiss cheese & fresh pineapple (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=f_5_unx-wrafcxuakbzrdw&select=lsuzxyk62n2wfmv_cn69tq).  this one really took me by surprise.  it was like biting into a hawaiian pizza with tangy bbq sauce.  very strange combination, but it surprisingly worked.\n\nlike the same cost of all their sandwiches, both of them cost only $5.99 each and then i washed everything down with earl's <mark>Earl Grey Lemonade</mark>.  it was a great late night pigout session for less than $17!  i will be back here again!!  love this place!", 
            "my favorite sandwich shop at my favorite hotel! i have tried most of the sandwiches, but my favorite is <mark>The Full Montagu </mark>. gotta love that roast beef! i love coming here when i start the day in vegas, but it's best enjoyed after a night of dancing at the finest clubs on the strip. \n\ni love that they can make a presentable, delicious, decently-priced sandwich without making me wait forever-even when there is a line snaking around the planet hollywood casino. try it while you're in vegas, you won't be disappointed!", 
            "okay this place is really just 3.5 stars in my book but being open 24 hours a day, located in my hotel, and cheap gives it an extra half of star. theres nothing spectacular about these sandwiches but it is an excellent value. we tried <mark>The Original 1762 </mark>, <mark>The Full Montagu </mark>, and one with turkey and cranberries that was bomb. i wanted to like this place more and was expecting more after all the great reviews. it was tastey and soaked up some booze at 5am.",

(the only peer is roli roti) this place is open 24hours, its cheap, fast, hot, and delicious! i recommend <mark>The Full Montagu </mark>. i wish there was one in california so i could nomnomnom on this all the time. sadly, the closest one is in vegas so i'll have to wait till to go there to pursue my quest of trying everything on their menu!", 
            "wow. heavenly. we ate here 4 times over the course of our 3-day stay, and it was great. the best sandwiches were <mark>The Full Montagu </mark> (better than <mark>The Original 1762 </mark>) and all-american, and the cobb salad never disappointed. the bacon-based breakfast sandwiches were kinda salty, so avoid those, but pretty much anything is great because it comes with their delicious baked-in-the-grill bread and has a great balance of flavors. i highly recommend that you go out of your way if you're in vegas just to try this place at least once (by the way, it's located on the south end at the junction of the casino area and the mall area).", 
            "i have been wanting to try this place forever!!!! im sooo glad i did. we stayed at the planet hollywood towers and you can bet that this was our go to late night spots. im sooo glad they were open soo late because without them we'd be stuck at some local gross diner. i ordered the <mark>Tuna Melt</mark> which literally melted in your mouth sooo amazing. the other night i had a <mark>The Full Montagu </mark> which was also amazing. the line can get kind of long but its not a long wait at all. im soo bummed theres not earl of sandwich here in the bay but don't worry i'll be back soon.", 
            "on my last trip to vegas, one afternoon i woke up to discover that three different groups of people i went there to meet had independently decided to go to earl of sandwich.  although i had never heard of this place before, it was clear that i had to try it, and i am definitely glad that i did.\n\nthe first thing that stands out about earl of sandwich is the price.  when you are used to paying $8-10 for a sandwich in dc, $6 for a sandwich is fantastic.  and when that $6 sandwich tastes better than any that you're used to, it's mind-blowing to say the least.\n\ni tried <mark>The Original 1762 </mark> 1762, a roast beef sandwich with cheddar cheese and horseradish sauce.  i also had a taste of <mark>The Full Montagu </mark>, which has roast beef, turkey, swiss, cheddar, lettuce, <mark>Tomato</mark> and mustard.  first off, the bread is outstanding.  it's toasted and has a great crunch to it, without being overly thick.  the meats are also great and the sandwiches have a good amount on them.  although the sandwiches are a bit on the small side, they are ok for a smaller meal, especially when paired with chips or soup (which i did not personally try, but have heard good things about).\n\noverall it's a great place to go and i highly recommend it.  that sandwich was one of the best i've ever had and i wish i had had time to try more of their menu.  whether it's a late night snack or lunch, earl of sandwich is definitely worth checking out.", 
            "<mark>The Full Montagu </mark> - tastes like potbelly's. except the bread is thinner and softer and doesn't get as soggy.\n\nand sure subway is offered at a comparable price, but not on the strip. last time i had subway, they charged me like $10-12 for a footlong. this place is a steal for the quality!", 
            "oh mr. earl of sandwiches! i heart your gold bars of delicious-ness. (yes the sandwiches are wrapped in gold foil, and they're so rectangular!)\n\nmy bf and i shared the hawaii bbq and the popular <mark>The Full Montagu </mark>. plus the tomato soup. (unfortunately the soup was lukewarm but the sandwiches made up for it)\n\nwe liked the hawaii bbq better as it was more flavorful. we had to add grey poupon to <mark>The Full Montagu </mark>, and that made it 10x better.\n\nthe bread is toasted with magic. omgoodness.\n\ni want to stay in planet  hollywood next time just so i can have easy access to mr. earl *grabby hands*",

            "this is a very popular sandwich place in vegas in the ph hotel.  there's usually a line but it goes by fairly quick.  i usually get <mark>The Full Montagu </mark> and a side of soup.  the sandwiches aren't the biggest in the world but they are high in quality.  if you're in a the mood for a light lunch after a night (or nights) of drinking, and you don't mind waiting in line, this would be a good stop.", 
            "first of all, let me just say how long i've waited to try earl of sandwich (over a year), how excited i was to try earl of sandwich (fuckin excited), and then how pissed i was when i couldn't even take a picture of the thing because it was so pathetic-looking (really fuckin pissed).\n\ni think like six of my friends ordered <mark>The Full Montagu </mark>, so i decided to go with <mark>The Original 1762 </mark>. it usually doesn't get much safer than \"<mark>The Original 1762 </mark>,\" but i was so disappointed. no, i was devastated at how much of a letdown this sandwich was. the bread is good, but it was the best part about the sandwich. the fuckin bread. i could tell that earl was going with a completely different concept with his sandwich than ike (@ lime). whereas ike mindfucks you with an avalanche of ingredients and flavors, earl keeps his sandwiches as simple as possible. my original had bread, meat, and sauce. that's it. i wanted so badly to appreciate the simplistic beauty of it, but i couldn't. it's just too boring.\n\ni had a bite of <mark>The Full Montagu </mark>, i was not impressed. i had a bite of the italian. i was decently impressed. i've heard good things about the hawaiian, so i'll come back to try that. if it sucks too, then i am done with you earl. you've literally broken my heart. bastard.",

            "everyone talks about this place when coming to vegas, so naturally i had to check this place out.  there was a long line as always, but it went by much more quickly than i had expected. you order, pay, and they'll call your number when your food is ready. \n\ni have no idea how they did it, but the bread was soo soft and delicious. their bread is truely unique. it really helps with the sandwiches.\n\nfood:\n1) <mark>The Full Montagu </mark> - the one thing i worry about ordering roast beef and turkey sandwiches is that they're dry. you don't have to worry about that here. combine these two well cooked meats with swiss and cheddar cheese, lettuce, <mark>Tomato</mark> and mustard sauce you get a simple, yet delicious deli sandwich.\n2) <mark>Tuna Melt</mark> - i don't usually order <mark>Tuna Melt</mark> but the <mark>Tuna Melt</mark> was awesome! it's a very simple tuna sandwich with cheese.  \n3) chocolate chip cookie - amazing cookie! even though it was sitting in a package, the cookie was still really soft and the chocolate was still gooey.",

            "i am a regular to vegas and the vegas food scene, which is comprised mainly of: expensive gourmet dining ($120 and up for 2 range), or overpriced mediocre dining (chain restaurants such as outback, whose prices are inflated because of its \"on the strip\" location, and rainforest cafe) and cheap fast food joints (prices still inflated from what they'd normally charge if not on the strip.. the panda express, mc'dees, rubios, s'barro pizza). \n\non my last trip to vegas, i decided that i wouldn't be a sucker anymore. i wanted to have a good meal, at a reasonable price, and if i have to walk half the strip, then so be it. i searched on yelp and earl of sandwich came up. a deja-vu moment came back, since i've been to planet hollywood before and recalled having briefly seen this spot, not far after you enter the hotel/ casino. i trekked my way from mgm to ph, for this. worth the 82 degrees heat, and the 15 min walk. and alas, i can't place earl in any of the 3 categories of the vegas dining scene. i guess i am mentally creating a new category: good & cheap! (i believe earl's is a chain, but it's too good to be put in the same league as the other chain restaurants). \n\nit was just the 2 of us, but since i wanted to give a fair review of the food, we got 3 sandwiches for variety: <mark>The Full Montagu </mark>, the <mark><mark>Ham <mark>Turkey 'N' Swiss</mark></mark></mark> and the <mark>All American</mark>. <mark>The Full Montagu </mark> is my favorite, with just the right amount of meat (roast beef and turkey), 2 types of cheese (swiss and sharp cheddar) and a good slab of the house mustard sauce.the <mark>All American</mark> is like thanksgiving on a sandwich (it has cranberries, turkey, cheese). the ham and swiss is the most boring choice of the 3, but it's good quality ham n' cheese sandwich. \n\nyou do have to get chips or any other sides for additional cost, as they aren't included in the $5.95 price (for all sandwiches!). they get packed. but other than that, it's a solid spot.",

            "as i am writing this, \"earl of sandwich\" has 1186 reviews and 4.5 stars for a rating. the short of it is the rating is totally deserved. it is not 5 star in my eyes because there are no pastrami, corned beef or rubin offerings (a fact that the order taker knew all too well) and so i can't in all good conscious give it that  1/2 star. but boy howdy, they know how to make a sandwich.\n\ni had the \"<mark>The Full Montagu </mark>\" and my wife the \"club sandwich\". both were done just right with tasty sauces on bread that could stand up to the true test of a sandwich, which is, can you eat it holding it in one hand with poker cards in the other hand? this means the sandwich is stacked right, pressed correctly, not too moist to soggy out the bun, does not dribble parts of it down your shirt and most importantly not fall apart. if it meets those criteria and tastes fantastic you got yourself a winning sandwich. and at \"earl of sandwich\" you got yourself a winning sandwich.\n\ni am not going to go into more details; the other 1186 reviews will state more than i can ever write. but i will say this: i am a vegas local which means i normally do not head into the casino for a sandwich, it is just too much of a hassle, but that may change now that i have tasted the goodness of \"earl of sandwich\", and i don't know of any better recommendation.\n\n\"earl of sandwich\" people, if you are reading this, open up one of these in north las vegas. i will drive to it; i will eat there... often. please please please open one nearby. amen!",

            "this is probably the only place (off the top of my head) that really, truly deserves a 5/5. maybe even a 6.5/5. the business didn't pay me to say that. although they could pay me in sandwiches... that would be my dream. \n\nto start, i didn't know about the hype at all; i've never even heard of this place until my friends and i stayed at ph so i had no clue that it was kind of a big deal. i came in with an open mind (and a growling stomach) to say the least. \n\ni think what initially attracted me to this place was that its open 24 hours. the fact that i could get food from this place at any point of the day is a big plus, especially since it's vegas. people tend to lose track of the time from all the booze hounding they do. i kind of did. anyway, i recall seeing a huge line up during lunch time and i was quite intrigued. i decided to try it and see what it was all about. \n\nmy first sandwich was <mark>The Full Montagu </mark>. roast beef, turkey, swiss and cheddar, lettuce, <mark>Tomato</mark> and this earl's mustard sauce. holy orgasmo in my mouth. not even joking, it was so delicious. the bread was nicely buttered and toasted, moist meat, crisp lettuce, velvety cheese... and that sauce! mouthwatering. i think the price helped a whole lot too. i don't remember how much i paid for it exactly but i think it was somewhere around $7 or $8. so worth it. \n\ni was so happy with my initial purchase that i decided to come back the next day and bring my friend along. this time we got the blt, the hawaiian and the tomato soup. the blt was a jacked up blt, not in terms of size but in terms of taste. it was really good. the hawaiian had a spicy, smoky, sweet taste to it which i really loved. another home run. but the biggest surprise for me in this round was the tomato soup. i have never tried a tomato soup as good as the one i've had there. it was nice and silky and the croutons! oh my damn those croutons... wonderfully soaking in the rich tomato goodness. i paid around $10 for the blt and the soup. it was so worth it; the sandwich and the soup were nice portions and really good.\n\nwould i come back? hell to the yes. great food for a great price. so worth trying. i tell any of my friends that are going to vegas to try this place. that's how impressed i was.", 
            "thanks to yelp, i found this place on our last trip to vegas while staying at planet hollywood. between all of the fattening buffets and the over-eating, we wanted a lighter yet still delicious lunch and were lucky to find this place. \n\nthey offer hot toasted sandwiches with very fresh ingredients. i had <mark>The Full Montagu </mark> and my bf had <mark>The Earl's Club</mark> and both were delicious (although we were eye-ing ppl's meatball sandwiches too). i really like the bread here and i was surprised at how affordable the prices were. $6 for a sandwich isn't bad at all. seemed quite popular too, but service was fast. we would definitely come back to this place again next time we're in town.",

            "don't get me wrong, for food i would have rated this place 4 stars, but their service was awful which brought my rating down to 3 stars.\n\nlets start with why: the service was awful. for a fast food place they do not efficiently take advantage of the large staff they have on hand. there are 4 people at the register but only one person who is actually on the register. the other 3 workers are just standing behind the cashier chatting. if there is a long line of customers waiting to order, the best thing to do is to open up your second cashier and double the orders. there are plenty of people working on making the sandwiches, its much better than having staff members bored and waiting around while there is a long line of customers. it just looks ridiculous. \n\nthe second time i came here the line was incredibly long and there was only one cashier (yet again) so i decided to call in my order instead. i skipped the long line to order n just paid at the register. the person calling out the orders for pick up had the worst attitude. they kept making comments at me even though i was just patiently waiting. they were just being rude. seriously miss you're working at a sandwich shop in las vegas, for probably minimum wage, please stop power tripping over when i can get my sandwich. \n\nso service for this place is terrible. workers are rude and the wait is long for no real reason. upper management should really consider retraining and restructuring their system. because terrible service is never acceptable if your running a good sandwich shop. the least you can do is make sure your employees have good customer service.\n\nonto the delicious sandwiches. i would highly recommend <mark>The Full Montagu </mark> sandwich. it was seriously the best thing on the menu i had. the sandwich is baked so the cheese is nice and melted. all the ingredients are fresh. i also had their jerked chicken sandwich, and it was very good. the grilled chicken was juicy and flavorful and the peppers had a good spicy kick! i also tried their club sandwich and that was very delectable as well. bacon was nice and crispy but not burnt. just something about a nice hot sandwich really hits the spot. their bread is freshly baked so you really get a good sandwich. the price is very affordable. one sandwich averages about $5! not bad!!\n\nhonestly the earl of sandwich's customer service really killed it for me. i loved the sandwiches but it would be a major hindering factor for me to come back. there are so many great restaurants in vegas, why would i put myself thru so much crap from the staff members of the sandwich shop. please keep in mind i came here twice and had a horrible experience with their customer service both times. \n\nrecap:\n1) highly recommend calling in your order because there's usually a long wait\n2) montagu sandwich is amazing",

            "in our 4 days here, we went here like 3 times that i am aware of.  prices aren't too bad at $5.99 a sandwich and they taste really good.  not super packed but they hit the spot.  i wish they were stuffed a little bit more, but they are still very good for the price in my opinion.  the bread makes the sandwich as it is toasted and very good, almost like really good mexican torta bread.  i had the caprese, <mark>The Full Montagu </mark>, and the italian.  i would highly recommend either of them and i can't really say any was better than the other because they were all different and delicious.  i think it helped with the italian that we had some salad in our room and i threw that onto the sandwich while we were in the room as it made it a little more beefy and added some more flavor.  place is open 24 hours i think, but i am sure it is open at late hours as we stopped here after partying at the marquee all night so it was probably like 3 or 4 in the morning and they were still open.\n\neitherway, when i am back at ph next month for my stay, ill probalby be here at least once",

            "oh my gosh this was one of the best parts of vegas. this has got to be one of the best sandwiches i have ever tasted. not only are they open 24 hours a day but they are sooooooo good and at such a reasonable price! $5.99 for most of the sandwiches. \n\ni tried <mark>The Full Montagu </mark> and once i took that first bite i instantly fell in love. the bread is so good and crispy on the outside but super soft on the inside. the sauce they used was unbelievable and the 2 meats and 2 cheese and tomato and lettuce fit perfectly all together. this place was so good that my 2 guy friends that came with me had to get in line again for seconds w/in 10 minutes. \n\nthe only downside is that there is a bit of a line to order but the sandwiches are made right away when you sit down. seating is also a bit hard to look for but if you just stand around and look at people who are almost finishing you shouldn't have a problem. \n\nmust try place!!!!!!!!!!!",

            "open 24 hours! i went there for lunch on friday afternoon & the line wasn't too bad.  i got <mark>The Full Montagu </mark>, which was quite delicious.  seating can get pretty bad during rush, but it wasn't too bad when i got there.  your sandwiches come out very quickly as well.  i went there again on sunday morning to pick up some sandwiches for the ride back.  i got the chipotle chicken sandwich, which was a limited time only item.  it wasn't that good bc i ate it when i got back to cali, but i'm sure it would've been delicious if i ate it while it was fresh.  it's under $7 i believe for one.  make sure to stop by here if you're ever in vegas! i'm craving it again!",

            "it's hard to give a sandwich place 5 stars, but this place is as close as it gets! i finally made my way here after all my trips to vegas, and i must say i've been missing out!! their bread is probably why their sandwiches are so popular. slight crisp on the outside but so soft and moist inside. it also helps that most of their sandwiches are full of cheese! my favorite! nothing better than melted cheese combining all the ingredients together. my friend actually recommended the tuna, and i was like what? who orders a plain old <mark>Tuna Melt</mark> at the most popular hot sandwich place?! well, i was proved wrong because their <mark>Tuna Melt</mark> was probably the best i've ever had. rich and creamy, and full of cheese! every bite had a long strand of cheese pulling apart, and i just couldn't get enough of it! even after finishing my <mark>The Full Montagu </mark>, i was stealing some <mark>Tuna Melt</mark> from my boyfriend. \n\nthankfully, the two of us ordered 3 sandwiches (because we're gluttons), and we were stuffed at the end. the third sandwich was the <mark>All American</mark>, and it was really good too! the cranberry sauce made it sweeter, and the roasted turkey was also juicy and tender! i actually preferred the <mark>All American</mark> over my <mark>The Full Montagu </mark>, but maybe it's just because i'm not a huge mustard fan. my friend ordered a tomato soup along with his sandwich, and it was too sour for him to finish. basically, just stick with the sandwiches! it called earl of sandwich, not soup! also, they're opened 24 hours!!! i can't think of a better place to go when you're hungry and drunk. it's seriously the best idea ever. definitely one of the highlights at vegas!",

            "the best bread you will ever bite into... at least for a hot sandwich. i don't know how they do it... but it's cooked at the right temperature to get the crisp on the outside and the fluffiness in the inside. worth every penny. my personal favorite is the caprese with chicken. i've had the cannonball, the earl, <mark>The Full Montagu </mark> and the italian, and they're all delicious. depends on what you're in the mood for, but they're honestly all good. that's why the lines are ridiculously long! this location is opened 24/7 which makes it the perfect place to go to after a drunk night at <mark>The Earl's Club</mark>!",

            "as a local, it would make zero sense for me to go to planet hollywood for a sandwich. so my 5 star rating shouldn't be misconstrued as me saying i would frequent them all the time, but rather based on convenience and price compared to what you typically find in a las vegas casino. at $6 you would be hard pressed to find a better sandwich on the vegas strip. is it the best sandwich i have ever had? certainly not. however, with warm bread, tasty meat and relatively quick service... you can't beat earl of sandwich. added bonus is that it is directly across from the sports book... grab a sandwich and go sit and watch a game. \ni agree with misti that they have a major lack of options for not only bread but toppings and sauces. no oil and vinegar? how does a sandwich shop not have oil and vinegar?\nsandwich is not overly filling, which could be either good or bad depending on how you look at it. heading to see peepshow? probably don't want to sit through that on an overstuffed stomach! grab some earl and you will be good to go!\ni order <mark>The Full Montagu </mark> (i believe) which has turkey and roast beef. consistently good and they have not messed up an order of mine yet.",

            "i have heard so many good things about this place and finally had a chance to come here recently. overall, its pretty good and i know i will want to come back every so often. \n\nfirst of all, the prices are very reasonable. all of their sandwiches, salads and wraps are priced at either $5.99 or $6.49. don't be intimidated if you see a long line. the second time i came here, the line was so long that i thought for sure it would take me at least 30 minutes to get to the register and order. but that wasn't the case because the employees did a good job at keeping the line moving. \n\nthe food didn't quite blow me away, but it was still pretty good. definitely better than subway, quiznos, etc. i have tried <mark>The Earl's Club</mark> and <mark>The Full Montagu </mark>. i felt that they were stingy with the turkey in <mark>The Earl's Club</mark>. i had maybe 2 thin slices in my sandwich. unfortunately, you don't have a choice for your bread. it would be nice to have other options like wheat or cheese. but, the white bread was good enough - fresh and crispy on the outside. the chocolate chip cookie and brownie cream sandwich were tasty as well. apparently the brownies here are made from ghirardelli chocolate! \n\ni usually take my order to go since all the tables are always occupied. just an fyi - if you sign up for their eclub, you get a free sandwich on your birthday!",

            "great value in a town where most places gouge you!  had <mark>The Full Montagu </mark> and it was deeeeelicious and filling (even for a big guy like me!).  a great part for me was that the bread was substantial enough to hold the sandwich without being overdone... so few sandwich places hit the sweet spot, but they sure did!  the seating area was packed, but i think that's a testament to how good their sandwiches are.", 
            "i love the flavors of this place and the location. good sandwiches and the pleasure pit--can i ask for more? quick tips first though!\n\n1. there is a parking structure that enters into the rear of the miracle mile shops.\n\n2. earl of sandwich is located near the entrance of the casino via las vegas blvd.\n\n3. if you're taking the walkway, the shop is on the first floor. there is no direct elevator down to the first floor from the second floor shops! use the escalator. walk past, til you see pinks and go into the doors of planet hollywood.\n\nearl of sandwich is one of our favorite stops in vegas. the food is really great, the service is pretty fast, and the prices are really good--at least for vegas. my favorite sandwich here is the hawaiian chicken. man the sauce is amazing on it and the pineapple slice along with the melted cheese is almost heavenly. whenever my girlfriend and i come, we always order at least one hawaiian chicken sandwich.\n\nwe've also had the earl club, the chipotle chicken, and <mark>The Full Montagu </mark>. the first two sandwiches are good, though the earl club is a little too over the top with the sandwich sauce that they provide. it can get a little too messy and salty or it can be awesome and just right. the chipotle chicken is great too with a lovely chipotle sauce as well as avocados and bacon. the only thing we would not really recommend is <mark>The Full Montagu </mark>, just not as flavorful for us. the great thing about earl of sandwich is that their breads are toasted and rolled out of the machine on the spot. in fact you can watch them make your sandwich and roll it out on the grilling rack.\n\none of the things that i like is that even when the line is long, i can expect to wait maybe 10 minutes or so before ordering. the food is quick to come out as well. the only thing i would possibly say is an issue is that the service people may appear to be a little bit snippy when you're ordering a sandwich. this can be forgiven since i know that they deal with some fairly obnoxious guests that can be a little too drunk.\n\nanyways, the prices are what makes this place really special. realistically, $6.49 (hot) or $5.99 (cold) sandwiches would be nothing to go on about in la or in any other city for that matter, especially when you consider that the size of the sandwiches are not gargantuan and may be even on the small side. however, being that it is 1. in vegas and 2. in a casino, the prices that they set are pretty budget. i love this place just for the fact that my girlfriend and i can get full off of $20.\n\ni just want to point out though that besides the sandwiches, we have also tried some desserts that they offer. my girlfriend swears by the chocolate brownie. i'm not a brownie person myself, but i can agree that it is rich and definitely chocolatey. hope you guys can try it out for yourself!", 
            "got the \"chikn/ avo/ chipotle\" delicious. my husband got 2 because he couldn't choose: <mark>The Full Montagu </mark> & <mark>The Original 1762 </mark>...both were good. i really enjoyed a bite of his \"original\"",

            "i stayed at planet hollywood and this place was conveniently located at my hotel. i guess the only reason why this place is so highly reviewed is because it is the only place that i know of that is open 24/7. this place is pretty crowded in the wee mornings when people head out of <mark>The Earl's Club</mark>. the line is long but it moves quickly. \n\ni went there three times when i was in vegas for 4 days. the sandwiches are warm and toasty and very filling. i got <mark>The Full Montagu </mark> which comes with roasted beef, turkey, swiss, sharp cheddar, lettuce, tomato & mustard sauce. it is pretty tasty and i definitely want to try their other sandwiches. one of my fave things that i got was the brownie peanut butter creme sandwich. the brownie is soft and the peanut butter goes perfectly with the chocolate goodness. i bought two more for my ride back haha.\n\n**tips**\n1) the desserts just sit there as you wait in line. i recommend the brownie peanut butter creme sandwich!\n2) enjoy!",

            "decided to head down to the strip and deal with the crowds. luckily it wasn't too crazy and the line moved pretty quickly. the wife and i decided to order 3 sandwiches to share. all 3 were really great sandwiches...the bread is amazing and i thought they portioned everything just right. it's not hard to eat a sandwich and a half but for food on the strip, the pricing is on point. \n\n<mark>The Full Montagu </mark> - i believe this is one of their staple sandwiches and that's for good reason. the turkey and roast beef are both tender and on their own, have great flavor. this sandwich came out with the perfect temp and both cheeses (aged swiss/sharp cheddar) were melted perfectly. they also add a killer mustard sauce which just made it even better.\n\n<mark>Chipotle <mark>Chicken Bacon Avocado</mark></mark> - my wife's favorite of the 3. large chunks of juicy chicken, a good amount of bacon and compared to most other sandwich joints, huge pieces of avocado. the chipotle sauce had great flavor and didn't overpower the sandwich which i really liked.\n\nthe italian - this was our least favorite of the 3 but still a good sandwich. the flavor was great but they put way too much italian dressing on it. my favorite part was the cheese, i am a cheese lover and they put huge slices of fresh mozzarella on here...amazing!\n\nthe bread was exactly the same on all 3 and it's definitely up their in the top for sandwich joints. it tastes fresh baked and it has perfect texture. it's a bit like ciabatta but without the crisp outside. chewy all the way through, taste good and super soft. just excellent bread!\n\nwe also had some sides...<mark>Potato Salad</mark> and a <mark>Fruit Cup</mark>. the <mark>Potato Salad</mark> was ok and the fruit was fresh but neither stood out except for the prices. they give you very small prepackaged cups of the sides and they cost $2.49 each. i wish i had tried the mac n cheese that everyone seems to rave about.\n\nwas this the best sandwich i ever ate? no...but they were definitely on the top and deserve every bit of the thousands of positive reviews they get. they do have quite a small seating area and i'm usually not big on going down to the strip just to eat, but i wouldn't hesitate going back for more. in my opinion, ph has some of the best spots for food on the strip and earl's is one of them.", 
            "we always make it a point to go to earl of sandwich when we visit las vegas. right on the strip by the miracle mile section of planet hollywood and is open all night. i always order <mark>The Full Montagu </mark> and something else and while the something else is usually only decent, <mark>The Full Montagu </mark> never disappoints. definitely ideal after those drunken vegas nights when you're ready to hit the sack but need a quick bite before going to bed. the only bad thing is they have the tendency to get real packed. i've seen the line reach all the way out to the main walkway where you enter from outside. as long as you avoid the rush you'll usually get your food within 10 minutes of ordering.", 
            "another popular and raved about sandwich joint i've heard so much about. and after seeing my gf's always post pictures of their sandwiches i had to try it out. but couldn't soak up the whole experience since i had a protein bar an hour before and was trying to avoid eating heavy since were going to go clubbing afterwards. yes a very girly thing but hey, got to fit in my dress! just tried a few bites here and there. went both friday and saturday and wanted to go back again. something about the packaging reminded me of willy wonka's golden ticket that are hidden in the chocolate hahah. can never get enough. please come to la earl!\n\n_<mark>The Original 1762 </mark>, roasted beef, cheddar and horseradish sauce was pretty good. i loved the horseradish sauce! it really made the sandwich stand out. although a little too much meat for me. \n_<mark>The Full Montagu </mark>, roasted beef, turkey, swiss, cheddar, lettuce, tomato, and mustard sauce was one big juicy bite. although it seemed a little too cheesy. i think either swiss or cheddar would be good but having both was a bit too rich for me. but i'm sure most like a whole lot of cheese. luckily the small amout of lettuce and tomato helped a bit.\n_<mark>Chipotle <mark>Chicken Bacon Avocado</mark></mark>, grilled chicken, <mark>Bacon, Egg <mark>Ham 'N' Cheddar</mark></mark>, avocado, lettuce and chipotle sauce was my favorite. the chipotle sauce was great and not too overdrenched. every bite was better and just melts in your mouth. \n_baja chicken salad, romaine, grilled chicken, cheddar, cilantro, avocado, <mark>Tomato</mark>, roasted corn, black beans, tortilla strips, and red wine vinaigrette was refreshing. the salad was a bit small of a portion but not bad. nothing amazing. but good to share with a friend and half a sandwich. \n\ni would definitely come back and this time make sure not to eat any protein bars beforehand haha. and wear a more loose dress. can't wait to go back and try the other sandwiches!",

            "this has been a favorite spot for years. the sandwiches are amazing, and it's in the planet hollywood, so one of the nicer but not stuck up areas of the strip. unless you go at a real-late hour, though, be prepared for an understandable wait, and even if you do go real late there's a risk. <mark>The Full Montagu </mark>, every day, all day.", 
            "yes it lives up to the hype.\nyes there will be a long line.\nyes you should come here sober or drunk.\n\ncan't decide on a sammie? -- go splities with a friend on two sammies. odds are you'll enjoy both.\n\nbut if i had to -- <mark>The Full Montagu </mark>, italian and original.", 
            "finally, i found a place in vegas that is a decent substitute for a hoagie from the northeast.\n\na hoagie/sandwich is one of those things where the major components all add to the overall experience.  you can't just have one component carry the slack for the rest of the components.  a lot of times i'll find a place where the meats are great, but the bread is terrible or vice versa.\n\ni had <mark>The Full Montagu </mark> here.  the bread was fresh; it actually had a great crust and was chewy on the inside as well.  the right bread is the hardest thing to find in most places. the meat itself is top notch, and is just as good as boar's head branded meat, if it isn't actually boar's head.  i liked this place much better than capriotti's; if you're a fan of hoagies from philly or ny come here. \n\nthis place always seem to have a super long line whenever i walk past, but it seems to move quickly.  they have call ahead ordering and i recommend doing that to skip the line.\n\ni'll definitely be back to try other sandwiches, and hope it's just as good as <mark>The Full Montagu </mark>.", 
            "i came here because of the high rating and almost 4000 reviews!! goes to show that doesn't always mean everything.\n\nthe sandwiches were just ok.  \"meh\" at best.  the meat is thin, processed cuts.  i had <mark>The Full Montagu </mark> and like i said, nothing to write home about.  tasted the <mark>Tuna Melt</mark> and again, meh.  i've had better.  i think the number of reviews and high ratings comes from the late night, post-drinking clientele. \n\nstaff were friendly and food came out fast. sandwiches were about $6.49.  would i come back? nope...unless i was broke and couldn't afford to eat better!", 
            "yesterday on a family trip to vegas, we had nothing to eat. my sister suggested earl of sandwiches, but my dad at first resisted because he isn't a big fan of sandwiches. when we got there, the line was a bit lengthy but went pleasantly fast. our sandwiches were nice and toasty (we got the chicken chipotle and <mark>The Full Montagu </mark>), and after my dad took a few bites he said: \"i want to go back to our hotel room, turn on the tv, and eat this sandwich.. that's my dream.\" as you can see, earl of sandwiches changed my dad's opinion about sandwiches with it's deliciousness! it is a great place to visit overall.", 
            "my husband and i shared <mark>The Full Montagu </mark>. the inside of the sandwich was gooey and tasty as the bread was still crisp but not hard (we ate it about 30min after we got the sandwich). the lines moved rather quickly: 1.you order and a receipt is handed to you 2.move along the line, pay at the next register with anything you picked up along the way and you also order your cup for the fountain drinks at this register. they hand you another receipt and a buzzer.\n3. when your buzzer buzzes pick up your sandwich next to the paid register.\nthe only thing i wanted more of was the meat! there was hardly any meat in <mark>The Full Montagu </mark>. it's not something i would go back for or crave for but  is something light and close by that i can grab when at planet hollywood. it's good enough to fill me for an hour or two. something to try but not a must.",

            "these sandwiches are amazing. the perfect bun to sauce to meat ratio. why have i not tried these sandwiches before??? <mark>The Full Montagu </mark>, earls club, and chicken avacado were all full of deliciousness.\n\nit's open 24 hours. be prepared for long line ups. it's worth the wait!", 
            "i had heard of this place many times before. it is the \"best sandwich\" you'll ever have, you \"have to eat here\", etc etc.   i thought i'd be let down because that's a lot of hype for just a sandwich shop but it met the hype and i want it now as i type this review!!\n\nlocation: this one is located at planet hollywood. ph is kind of big and i was still disoriented a bit but if you enter from the strip, walk through the casino and look for the big huge \"yolo's sign\" and earn of sandwich is right across from it. \n\nwe went around 1pm on friday and the line was kind of long but don't freak out because it goes really quick. you order your sandwich at the left and can pick up brownies and other things at the counter to the right. you pay there/give them your free brownie code and they'll give you a buzzer thing so you can find seating while you wait. \n\nwe went again on sunday around 11:30am/12pm and the line wrapped around the front of the restaurant. took maybe 10mins to order. both times after we paid, it took 5 -10 mins to get our food.  we were lucky both times and there was plenty of seating too. \n\nfood: since we were planning on going to a buffet for dinner, my bf and i split a <mark>Chipotle <mark>Chicken Bacon Avocado</mark></mark> - 6.49 (grilled chicken, <mark>Bacon, Egg <mark>Ham 'N' Cheddar</mark></mark>, avocado, lettuce & chipotle sauce).  omg it was so good. the cheese was perfectly melted and so gooey. the bread was toasted and the perfect amt of crisp on the outside and soft enough on the inside. the chicken was so moist and juicy and was a perfect combo of flavors with the avocado, bacon and sauce! the half sandwich was so not enough.. granite we were hungry and just did this to get us through the buffet but after i had the first bite i knew we'd have to come back before we left vegas. \n\nthe second time we went on sun- my bf got the <mark>Chipotle <mark>Chicken Bacon Avocado</mark></mark> again and i got <mark>The Full Montagu </mark> - 6.49 (roasted beef, turkey, swiss, cheddar, lettuce, tomato & mustard sauce). we both had half of each other's sandwiches and still hands down the cca was the better one. the fm was really good too though! that roast beef was so soft and juicy too! \n\nwe got a free brownie both times and it was good. it's more a cake-like brownie and i love those! i was thinking it would be too dense because they're triple chocolate but it was just right! totally tasted freshly baked, soft and a perfect way to end your meal. plus you can't beat free! \n\nfirst time to try it and i loved it. my friends told me they opened one in anaheim (about 45 mins from where i live in la) .... may be worth the drive for this place! it's def not \"just\" a sandwich like you know.. it's earned it's earl of sandwich title :d\n\nthank you yelpers for bringing this one up for cheap eats in vegas! worth it!\n\n\ntips and such\n---------------\nfull menu here: http://www.planethollywoodresort.com/content/dam/phv/dining/casual/earl-of-sandwich/eos-october-2013.pdf\n\nsign up for the mailing list for a free brownie: http://www.earlofsandwichusa.com/the-eclub/\n\nit took about a day to get the confirm email.  inside the email, there'll be a link to open that has a barcode for the cashier to scan for the free brownie.  we went twice while we were in vegas so we just split one brownie each time.  the first time, it didn't scan so they keyed it in. the second time we went i just showed it to them and they didn't bother scanning it. i'd get that brownie next time even if it wasn't free", 
            "i stayed at aria and realized this place wasn't too far of a walk.  sure, there are plenty of places to eat in aria, but you're paying double the price, easily.  \n\ni was able to try a few of the sandwiches and picked up some breakfast sandwiches for the airport (just in case).  i hate hanger.  \n\nsome sandwiches were definitely better than others.  my favourites were the chicken chipotle and <mark>The Full Montagu </mark>.  for the price and taste, not bad.  \n\nthese things don't travel well though.  eat them fresh and on the premises, otherwise, they drop down to two stars.", 
            "cheapest go to spot for your source of hangover food!  \n\ni admit i use to go to this place a lot because it was probably the most affordable place on the strip to eat at. however, this place is old news for me now since i have the luxury of eating it at downtown disney now!   \n\nfood: i usually opt for <mark>The Original 1762 </mark> sandwich or <mark>The Full Montagu </mark>. however, i personally prefer <mark>The Original 1762 </mark> ! in addition to the sandwiches, i also enjoy eating their clam chowder here, because it definitely hits the spot after a crazy night of partying. \n\nservice: the line is always long during the daytime, i feel like this place needs to learn how to be more efficient about this aspect of the business. but then again it may not be their fault, because everyone and their friends keep cutting the line! \n\nfinal verdict: love the sandwiches and soup, but i would probably only come back here if i was traveling on a budget.", 
            "i don't get what the hype is about this place don't get me wrong my sandwich was good, but it was just that. it was nothing special and i would not come back here or recommend it to anyone. i tried <mark>The Full Montagu </mark> and it was alright. i stole a few bites from the <mark>Tuna Melt</mark> (decent) and <mark>The Original 1762 </mark> (pretty good) but the only lasting impression is their mustard spread and horseradish sauce. the tomato soup tastes like it was warmed up from a can. also, my sister was in the mood for something simple and got the <mark>Grilled Cheese</mark>, it was like a roll of bread and the tiniest amount of cheese. way too much bread. the mac and cheese is good even though the way it's packaged reminded me of airline food which made me not want to try it but i'm glad i did as that was one of the best things i ate there.", 
            "so i'm just gonna say it...this is the best sandwich i've ever had!!! the thanksgiving holiday one is sooo freaking good! i tried the thanksgiving one and <mark>The Full Montagu </mark>, which was also good, but hands down, the thanksgiving one is thee best!  \n\ndo you remember the 'friends' episode where ross gets mad about someone eating his thanksgiving sandwich that monica made for him with \"the moist maker\"? well i always remember imagining what this sandwich would taste like with \"the moistmaker\" and now i know what it tastes like!! this is it!  the stuffing is \"the moistmaker\"!!! the cranberry sauce gives it the perfect sweetness for the sandwich. and turkey...and that's it! so simple so delicious!\n\nthis sandwich is that good that i ate it 3xs during my vegas trip...got everyone i was with obsessed with it too, then brought 6 sandwiches back home for myself, family and friends to also experience the best sandwich ever!  and that wasn't enough because i think about and crave it soo much and was soo sad when i ate the last one! now that i'm writing about it, i'm tempted to hop back on a plane to eat it ;)\n\nit's crazy because it's a simple fast food sandwich shop and it's this good!  it's also open 24 hours which is awesome!  it's the bread...it's crack bread :) do yourself a favor and order this sandwich to experience it in your life! well done earl, well done!!\n\ntip- it's located in planet hollywood casino right next to mall opening",

            "i always hear people rave about this place when they come to vegas so i decided i had to try it the next time i came to sin city. i didn't find it that amazing. do people overrate how good it is because they have it when they're drunk and starving after a night of drinking/partying? it's open 24/7 and not exorbitantly expensive, so i guess it's pretty convenient. \n\ni tried the ham egg and cheddar breakfast sandwich. pretty good. i like the bread they use. \nalso tried <mark>The Full Montagu </mark>. it was alright. although i didn't try it fresh/hot because i ordered it to pack for a hiking lunch so by the time i ate it it was cold. it was good, but not as amazing i thought it would be considering people speak of it so highly. \n\ntried the sugar cookie. three dollars. not cheap. their baked goods aren't cheap. the sugar cookie is good but super oily- i felt so guilty after i read it. \nred velvet cupcake is good but not amazing. \n\nthe tomato soup is good and comes with croutons. again- good but not the best tomato soup i've ever had. chicken noodle soup is...okay. \n\noverall this place is alright to me. but i'd come again considering how expensive everything else is on the strip.

            "we have only eaten at the restaurant in downtown disney and loved it there, and loved it here as well.   prices are so high in vegas that it was great to see a reasonable price for a great sandwich.  \n\ndon't be discouraged by the lines as they move quickly.   i had the bbq chicken and it was great.   chicken was tender, sauce was good and bread was so fresh and crispy.  my husband had <mark>The Full Montagu </mark> as usual, and loved it every bit as much.   i think you really can't go wrong with every sandwich.", 
            "no vegas trip is complete without at least a couple late night trips to earl.  we went twice while i was there recently.  my three buddies who had never heard of earl are now hooked and frantically searching for an earl near them.  i got the <mark>Chipotle <mark>Chicken Bacon Avocado</mark></mark> the first time and <mark>The Full Montagu </mark> the second time.  they got <mark>The Original 1762 </mark> both times.  the food is awesome, reasonably priced and they are super efficient.  i just wish they would open one in connecticut.", 
            "if i can, i will try to stop here at least once during my vegas trips. i've been here several times and am total fan of their sandwiches. the ones that are high on my list are: \n\n<mark>Tuna Melt</mark>\n<mark>The Earl's Club</mark>\nitalian\n<mark>The Full Montagu </mark>\n\nthe line and wait time isn't bad and their sandwiches run around $6.99 each. \nwhen you get to the first counter, you tell the person what sandwich you want to order, and they give you a buzzer and receipt to be rung up at the cashier at the end of the line. then you walk past the chips, fruits, cookies, drinks, and temptation until you reach the end cashier. that is where you will pay for your sandwich and either purchase a drink or ask for a water cup ;). then you find a seat and wait until you buzzer goes off indicating your food is ready to be eaten!\n\nvery affordable and will definitely satisfy those cravings.", 
            "i never thought i'd come here so often during my vegas trip, but when you need a quick bite to eat or when your friends are dying and are too incapacitated, this is the place to go, especially if you're staying at the planet hollywood.\n\n<mark>The Full Montagu </mark> was the favorite of everyone's. i've had that and also the thai wrap on another occasion. the best part of the sandwich is the bread because it was warm and crispy on the inside. however, there isn't much meat and vegetables for that size of bread. other than that, the sandwich was quite tasty and the bread, as i mentioned, is the best. for the thai wrap, i ordered this because i just needed some asian flavors after going so many days without it. the wrap was fine and nothing special. there was a bit too much sweet chili sauce and not enough peanut sauce. the ingredients were fresh, and there was a decent amount of filling in the wrap.\n\nthe people who work here are super friendly and will kindly answer any questions you may have and offer you suggestions. overall, this is great place to come to when you need a quick bite to eat, or had a bit too much to drink and need to bread to soak it all up. you'll leave full and satisfied.", 
            "tasty sandwiches. friendly staff, quick service and very reasonable prices. tried : <mark>The Full Montagu </mark>, jamaican jerk chicken, <mark>All American</mark> and chipotle chicken - all of them had different taste but jamaican jerk chicken was unanimous favorite amongst everyone in the group. the bread is crisp but soft and the portion size is just right. highly recommended.", 
            "i love it here, they make my sandwich perfect every time and i really mean it. it is perfection. my favorite is <mark>The Full Montagu </mark> and my husband's is the chipotle chicken. we never deviate from the two. our vegas trips are never complete without grabbing a few sandwiches each.", 
            "we weren't even hungry but seeing that there was no line for earl's for once, we hopped up to the front to order. the delicious aroma of the sandwiches wafting in the air definitely got us hungry. got <mark>The Earl's Club</mark> and <mark>The Full Montagu </mark>. both were delicious sandwichs. my favorite was <mark>The Earl's Club</mark>, love the basic ingredients in this sandwich, especially the spread that they used. <mark>The Full Montagu </mark> with it's roast beef and mustard was good too!\n\nif only this place did not have the usual long lines, i would definitely go here again. the price and quality left me quite satisfied.", 
            "it may be a little overhyped, but i love earl's. it's open 24/7 so it's great for late-night drunk food but is equally as satisfying sober. the sandwiches are about $7 each, so they're a little pricey given the size, but it's vegas..  the line can get pretty long so come at off-hours if you don't like waiting! there's a good amount of seating, but it gets packed easily, so chances are you'll be hovering over tables, waiting for people to leave.\n\ni don't think you can really go wrong with any of the sandwiches, but i do recommend eating them while they're still warm!\n\nmy preferences:\n     -<mark>The Original 1762 </mark> 1762 [roast beef, cheddar, horseradish sauce] - love the horseradish!\n     -italian [salami, capicola, ham, mortadella, mozzarella, tomato, italian seasoning, italian dressing] - lots of meat!\n     -<mark>Holiday Turkey</mark> [turkey, cornbread stuffing, turkey gravy, cranberry sauce, mayo] - tastes exactly like you'd expect\n     -the earls club [turkey, bacon, swiss, lettuce, tomato, sandwich sauce] - can't go wrong with bacon\n     -<mark>The Full Montagu </mark> [roast beef, turkey, swiss, cheddar, lettuce, tomato, mustard sauce] - pretty much a classic sandwich\n\ni've also tried the tomato soup. i'm not really a fan of the soggy croutons/bread in it, but the soup itself is pretty good.", 
            "so.... i have been here this past week alone about four times..#budgetinvegas. i've been here before and their sandwiches are always a hit. i have tried <mark>The Original 1762 </mark>, club, <mark>Chipotle <mark>Chicken Bacon Avocado</mark></mark>, <mark>Holiday Turkey</mark>, and <mark>The Full Montagu </mark>. my favorites have to be the chipotle chicken, original, and <mark>The Full Montagu </mark>... each sandwich is $7. it used to be cheaper... but still tasty! their sandwiches are not that big. you have to come here at least once while being in vegas. it will definitely help you save money esp being on a budget in vegas...\n\ntheir sandwiches are made fresh to order and toasted perfectly! each bite is so warm and just melts in your mouth. each ingredient in every sandwich compliments each other well. the service is fast! there is always a long line. better yet... they're open 24/7 !! come here when you're sober... drunk... sleepy... bored... hungry... or not hungry... you'll be craving. \n\ni have also tried their tomato soup and chicken noodle soup ! they're both pretty decent. it's about $2.99 for a cup and $3.99 for a bowl. soup always solves the problem in vegas...\n\ni haven't tried all of their sandwiches yet... but i will one day! \n\nearls has treated my wallet and tummy well this past week. until then !!", 
            "ordered <mark>The Full Montagu </mark> and mac n cheese and both were delicious! absolutely perfect. \n\ni literally just got to vegas and it's my first time being here ever. i'm starving and it's 2am, i'm overwhelmed by my choices but i wanted something simple since it was past midnight. yelped food by my hotel and this was one of the top rated places that wasn't pricey at all. staff is really friendly and helpful with recommendations! definitely will be coming back here before i leave.", 
            "good price great food. if you're in vegas and need lunch, you'd be hard pressed to find better for anywhere close to the price.\n\n<mark>The Full Montagu </mark> is what a hot sandwich is supposed to be, great meats on great bread.\n\nwatch out for line, gets packed in there.", 
            "what happened to the caribbean jerk chicken??? that was my favorite along with <mark>The Full Montagu </mark> and hawaiian chicken. i've also discovered the <mark>Tuna Melt</mark>! simple but delicious if you like the taste of the creamy mayo. also dont forget the tomato soup - really good.", 
            "this shop is located in planet hollywood right by the entrance to the mile shops. you place your order at the first counter. then you move down to the cashier where you get any additional items (chips, muffins, cookies, boxed salads, etc) and pay. fountain drinks, coffee, and lemonade are self-serve. there are several tables and bar seating which are typically full since it's a busy location. no outdoor seating since it's in the middle of the casino. open 24hrs. breakfast sandwiches before 11am. fairly quick service so double check your order because sometimes the order is incorrect.\n\nour order:\n<mark>Holiday Turkey</mark>: ($6.99) turkey, cornbread stuffing, turkey gravy, cranberry sauce & mayonnaise\nsea salt & vinegar kettle chips: $1.29\n<mark>Earl Grey Lemonade</mark>: $2.99\n\nbf's 1st time here (and almost the same for me since the last time i had it, i was a little kid & all i remembered was that i didn't care for it to much at the time). both the bf and i ordered the <mark>Holiday Turkey</mark> sandwich. their own artisan bread was toasted just right and wasn't too dense or dry. the stuffing was flavorful and the kind that's more on the wet side than the dry stuffing that i'm used to. not too much gravy to make the sandwich soggy (if eaten right away). the cranberry sauce was on the sweet side instead of the tart (which i prefer). the turkey are deli slices so they weren't dry but i would've preferred if they were thicker slices. overall a good sandwich. their salt & vinegar kettle chips went well with the sandwiches so i recommend getting a bag. the <mark>Earl Grey Lemonade</mark> was interesting but didn't have as much early grey flavor as i would've liked. bf didn't like the lemonade even though his tea of choice is earl grey.\n\n<mark>The Full Montagu </mark> and <mark>The Original 1762 </mark> are the popular sandwiches so may try that next time if i'm nearby since they are open 24 hrs.", 
            "when we ordered our sandwiches, they gave us one of those timer things to tell us when our order was ready. we waited roughly twenty minutes for an order of four sandwiches. it's worth it. i do not recommend the <mark>Hawaiian BBQ</mark> one but <mark>The Full Montagu </mark> was so good. the bread was delicious. it was like a bit crispy but not too crispy that it'll crumble everywhere onto your clothes when you bite into it. overall, very satisfied with the burgers there. prices were great", 
            "best place to go for good sandwiches and decent prices. also has soup for people who want that. it is open 24 hours a day so you can get it whenever you want. it is basically my go to place when i'm feeling hungry because i guess i get the bang for my buck for vegas standards. i get the <mark>Chipotle <mark>Chicken Bacon Avocado</mark></mark> in recent times but i used to get <mark>The Full Montagu </mark> or <mark>The Earl's Club</mark>. what the sandwich is made up of is on the menu. for soup, i usually get chicken noodle but the soup varies depending on time of day. there are multiple soups to choose from, which is a good thing if you are not into chicken noodle. also, sometimes there are long waits depending on the time, which is the only down side to the place. they sorta expanded the area due to the amount of customers they get. great place for hot sandwiches! enjoy!",

            "i had the chipotle chicken sandwich and my hubby had <mark>The Full Montagu </mark>. my order was better, as always . the prices are great, my sandwich was amazing and my husband loved his too. i gotta say this was the best sandwich i have ever had. the only thing i didn't like is that it could have had a little more meat and that we had to pay at a different register for the soda and sides which was weird and inconvenient to pay at two different registers for the same place. other than that i would greatly recommend this spot for lunch.", 
            "i see everyone ranting and raving about this place. i thought it was alright, not like the best place ever though.  we strolled in, on our way up to our hotel room for the night and my boyfriend and i split <mark>The Full Montagu </mark>.\n\nhow does a sandwich place not have pickles?! something is extremely wrong with this picture, and that's my favorite part, i was disappointed. i also got the chicken noodle soup, it was okay too, but i forgot to get a spoon, so that was fun eating with out one. ahha \n\ni'd go again though and try something else with a different soup maybe.", 
            "i ordered <mark>The Full Montagu </mark>, original 1762, <mark>All American</mark> and <mark>Hawaiian BBQ</mark> all for myself because i was starving and had money to blow on food during vacation. each sandwich was super tasty. much better value than when buying a sandwich/sub from a common chain like subway. the sandwiches are decently sized and the sauces inside are unique. there isn't too much of a lineup because it moves quite efficiently and lots of seating available (as it's in a food court). highly recommend this place. you won't go wrong if you want a damn, good sandwich and come here.", 
            "best sandwiche i've ever had!!!!!! i had <mark>The Full Montagu </mark> and my husband had the thai wrap and we were both floored with how good they were! i talked about the sandwich pretty much for the rest of the night and into the next day, even saying we should grab another for the flight home! everything was fresh and delicious. i hope they bring earl of sandwich to chicago!!!",

            "rating: 4.5 stars\n\npeople have been raving about earl's since the car ride over to my hotel. and it is that good. why is it not 5 stars? because i had something really similar in korea, and it was better there :[ haha\n\nconvenient to order, easy to customize i guess (if you're picky about condiments and stuff). i had the earl club sandwich; it was so good, typical insides.. i think it was turkey + bacon + condiments. my friends tried the <mark>Holiday Turkey</mark> sandwich; it is thanksgiving in yo mouf. seriously; turkey, cranberry sauce, gravy. i really like how they slightly toast your buns.. i also wish they could be bigger, but oh well. my girl friends and i ate half before pregaming and ate the 2nd half after clubbing lol so it was practically like 2 meals! wow! \n\nit's located in the miracle mile shopping center which was right next to where i stayed. yay for convenient locations and delicious food!", 
            "don't let the long line fool you! they have the sandwich assembly line down to perfection. they move pretty quickly and your food will come out in no time. the sandwiches here are cheap, the perfect size, and most importantly, really yummy! aaaand they're open 24 hours for your late night cravings/drunchies!\n\ni tried <mark>The Full Montagu </mark> and the <mark>Holiday Turkey</mark>. i must say, the <mark>Holiday Turkey</mark> is quite possibly one of the best sandwiches ever! it truly is thanksgiving in a sandwich, made with turkey, stuffing, and cranberry sauce. yumm! the cranberry sauce wasn't too sweet like i had expected it to be. it was just perfect and balanced out the saltiness of the turkey. <mark>The Full Montagu </mark> was good but definitely nothing to write home about. i love how they lightly toast the bread also. \n\nthis place is definitely a must when in vegas! ): i miss it already!", 
            "<mark>Holiday Turkey</mark> sandwich. best thing ever!!!! i hate the fact that this is seasonal. it's thanksgiving day right now... & i couldn't care less about what i'll be eating in a few hours because all i want to do right now is to go back to vegas and buy 100 of these holiday sandwiches and freeze them because yes, it was thaaaaat good.\n\nturkey - goooooood. stuffing - goooooood, gravy - yummmmmmm, and top it off with cranberry sauce - omg ... i die and go to food heaven. \n\nif you're in vegas, i'm jealous. eat this now.", 
            "best effing sandwich of my lifeeeeee. and that's not just the drunchies talking because i had it for lunch another day too...\n\nyes this place is so perfect that i ate here 2/3 days in vegas. i know the 1500+ reviews already speak for themselves but i feel compelled to write a review because it's that delicious!!!\n\nto be honest i only had the <mark>Holiday Turkey</mark> special so i didn't try the normal ones but omg. turkey, stuffing, gravy, cranberry sauce, seasoned mayo, all between two perfectly toasted pieces of bread. heaven. i should've been more daring but i just loved this sandwich so much i didn't want to try anything else. i think i could live on this.... ultimate thanksgiving sandwich. \n\ngood at both 3am and 1pm, or any other time for that matter since it's 24/7!! i also got the loaded potato soup which was decent, but their forte is obviously their sandwiches. when most other decent meals in vegas are at least $10, earl of sandwich shines through at a reasonable price of $5.99.... salivating as i write this.\n\non behalf of all my friends, the next time you're in vegas, you must stop here, whether it's at 4am after a night of clubbing or for an orgasmic lunch/dinner-- heck, even breakfast!!!", 
            "delish! open all day all nite, sells sammiches, drinks, chips, and soup. \n\nc'mon man, man! you can't complain.\n\nyes there's a long line, but it goes by fast. i mean you're in vegas. chances are you're with people who you enjoy being around, so waiting in line won't be bad. suck it up especially if you want a good sammich!\n\nmy friends and i had an ingenious idea. 2 of us ordered 2 different sammiches and split with each other so we can get to taste 2! genius, pure genius lloyd.\n\ni ordered the <mark>Hawaiian BBQ</mark> and my friend ordered the <mark>Holiday Turkey</mark> sandwich. the hawaiian had the sweetness from the pineapple with the smokey taste of barbecue, perfectly cooked. it had a pleasant balance. the <mark>Holiday Turkey</mark> was just like thanksgiving in my mouth! turkey with cranberry sauce and stuffing! dang i'm getting hungry just writing this review! shoot, i think i just sold myself again\n\nwhen in vegas...\n\ntry the earl of sandwich!", 
            "if you want yummy and amazing hot sandwiches for a cheap price in las vegas, earl of sandwich is the place to be! \n\ni have been going to this joint every time i visit las vegas because the sandwiches here are one of the best i ever had! the last time we went to earl of sandwich, i had the <mark>Holiday Turkey</mark> sandwich. that sandwich in itself got me full for only $6 and i was happily satisfied because it has so much flavor and everything you can look for in a <mark>Holiday Turkey</mark> sandwich - oven-roasted turkey slices, cranberry sauce, stuffing, and mayonnaise. i love how my hungry appetite disappeared right away because of this sandwich and my other favorite, <mark>The Original 1762 </mark> 1762.\n\nit's a very good thing they are open 24 hours, 7 days a week because in times where the hardcore munchies begin right after a night of club hopping, drinking, and dancing, i know that earl of sandwich will not disappoint.", 
            "very disappointed in this place. i am a sandwich lover. the bread they use is fantastic, but they hardly put any fillings inside the sandwiches, and the fillings are not high quality. the photos of the sandwiches here on yelp, and on the posterboards in the store, are totally misleading. on our 3 sandwiches, you couldn't even see the filling unless you opened them up. they are beyond skimpy on the meat and cheese. i was also disappointed that they didn't offer a pastrami sandwich, i found the rest of the selection very limited too. the prices are cheap, but the sandwiches are tiny, and are 90% all bread. please, charge me more money, and give me better quality meat and cheese, and put a little more on the sandwich, so it is more than just a bread sandwich. their <mark>Holiday Turkey</mark> and stuffing sandwich was inedible it was so bad. it had a funny taste to it, the stuffing was bad, and there was only one small clump of the cranberry on one spot on my sandwich. try some fresh carved turkey, and not some pedestrian lunchmeat turkey. the two good things about this place are the bread, and they do make your sandwich quickly, but that is partly because they don't waste time putting much inside the sandwich itself. i had way better sandwiches at 2 other places in vegas. i find it very interesting that people can be fooled into thinking a sandwich is a good, based on the bread alone. if you like good bread and tiny portions of tasteless meat and cheese, then this is the place. i make a better sandwich with my panini maker at home. i will only go back when i am in the mood for toast. the high ratings on this place, must be the result of some kind of mass hysteria, or people who were weaned on subway sandwiches.", 
            "this place is so freaking good my friends and i had to stay eat here twice during our stay over the weekend!!\n\nevery sandwich is $6 which is amazing since it's vegas, baby!  there is always line but don't let that deter you from trying this out!  it takes 10 minutes maybe even less to stand in line, order and get your food.\n\nmy new goal in life is to try every sandwich here and i definitely see more vegas trips in my future.  so far i can cross off the caprese, original 1762 and the <mark>Holiday Turkey</mark>.  the caprese consists of mozzarella, <mark>Tomato</mark>, basil and drizzled with basalmic vinaigrette!  it was exactly like a caprese salad in sandwich form.  <mark>The Original 1762 </mark> 1762 has slices of roast beef, cheddar and horseradish sauce.  the horseradish sauce is perfect and really makes the sandwich.  now last but certainly not least is the <mark>Holiday Turkey</mark>!  after one bite, i just wanted to make out with that sandwich.  it was a unique thanksgiving sandwich for me because i had never come across one with stuffing before.  and boy did it make a difference.  the stuffing was soaked in gravy and kept the sandwich very moist!  and the turkey, cranberry sauce and seasoned mayo was good as well. but sadly the <mark>Holiday Turkey</mark> is seasonal and will be offered until january 8th. \n\nit's open 24 hours so there's no excuse for you not being able to try it!  i have so much love for the buns of the earl of sandwich!", 
            "oh earl of sandwich... where would we eat without you.  when you are on a vegas trip with a group of students in their mid-twenties, you will end up at earl of sandwich somehow, somewhere.  located right in the middle of the miracle mile shops, this speedy sandwich shop is the cheapest and yummiest meal you will find on the strip.  \n\nthere are a ton of different sandwiches, salads, soups, and wraps that could fill anyone.  <mark>The Full Montagu </mark> is always a hit with the roast beef and turkey all in one sammie.  i think i have tried over half of the sandwiches on the menu and i haven't been unhappy with any of them.  on a recent visit this past weekend i tried their <mark>Holiday Turkey</mark> sandwich.  it was delicious.  it had turkey, stuffing, cranberry, and gravy!  it was like thanksgiving in a sandwich.  so scrummy... i think what makes these sandwiches so good is the toasted bread.  the bread is super good.  fluffy and crispy at the same time.\n\ni have had multiple friends eat this about 4 times in one weekend.  no joke.  at $6.48 ($5.99 plus tax) per sandwich, this place is a great deal.  your belly and wallets will be satisfied.  you can go and waste the rest of your money on roulette.", 
            "one of the best sandwich shops out there. completely blows subway and quiznos out of the water in terms of the taste, quality, and freshness of the protein and <mark>Veggie</mark> in addition to sandwich flavors. additionally the bread is near artisinal, a sort of ciabatta-white bread fusion where the crust is crisp and the crumb pleasantly pliable. at $6 a sandwich, although they're around six inches, each sandwich is much heartier than the typical 6-inch at subway or quiznos. around two sandwiches is perfect for a meal, albeit one will suffice for some. even though the price comes out relatively pricey per meal, this sandwich joint is certainly worth a try, especially since it is open 24-hours. \n\ngladly ate here with friends for breakfast, lunch, as well as dinner as an alternative to the buffets in vegas, i would prefer six of these sandwiches over the $35/person buffet at the wicked spoon or other vegas buffets. the <mark>Holiday Turkey</mark> sandwich is a must-have along with <mark>The Original 1762 </mark> and <mark>The Full Montagu </mark>. if only earl expanded to ca.", 
            "all my friends come here when they visit sin city, so when me and the girlfriends had the opportunity to try it i was all for it. \n\ntheir sandwiches are so good! \n\nwe split <mark>The Earl's Club</mark>, <mark>Holiday Turkey</mark>, and meatball. they were all really good\n\nthe bread is amazing and the the makings of each sandwich are great at just over $6 a sandwich. \n\nperfect for a no fuss quick lunch!", 
            "holy moly with a big bowl of ravioli and a fatty cannoli! this place is the bomb-diggity.com! best place to eat when you can't decide where to eat, and also if you need to fill up quick and cheap!\n\nservice is surprisingly quick, what with how many people line up here, and the sandwiches are to droooooooool for! i had 2 sandwiches a day for the 4 days that i was in vegas because i just could not get enough. the bread is the centerpiece of this wonderful shabang of awesomeness, and it's just perfectly crunchy and soft on the inside.\n\ni had the <mark>Holiday Turkey</mark> (omgaga) sandwich over the holiday season, and it was like the venus di milo of sandwiches! it was turkey, stuffing, cranberry sauce, and like special mayo all wrapped up in that delicious bread.\n\n<mark>The Full Montagu </mark>, the ham and swiss breakfast sandwich, and the cannonball sub, are all close seconds.\n\ndefinitely come here for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and after-dinner!", 
            "if you're in vegas...try this place!! i've been here many times because they have one of the best sandwiches! what's more important to you? the bread or what's in between? well, i have to say...they make a tasty combination of sandwiches!\n\ni've tried most of them and they're all good so it's personal preference. my favorite is their <mark>Holiday Turkey</mark> sandwich, oven roasted turkey, stuffing, cranberry sauce, and gravy. delish! fyi, it's not available all year long. \n\nexpect a line but not too long of a wait and plus, it's available 24 hours!",

            "when our long drive to vegas led to a hankering for food, earl of sandwich really hit the spot.  this gem is hidden away in planet hollywood, past the casino floor.  \n\nthe workers appear to be trained to handle large crowds of people.  the way the line worked was very efficient, and i liked the use of the buzzer system to speed things up.  \n\nthe prices are reasonable for a sandwich ($5-6.50), and the combinations are creative and delicious.  i ordered the <mark>Holiday Turkey</mark> sandwich (because why not? tis the season!), and it tasted like a mini thanksgiving dinner.  it was juicy, the bread was slightly crispy but still soft, i was in food heaven.  however, the sandwich was waaay smaller than i expected! still good, but finishing it just left me craving more.", 
            "open 24 hours, and it's gotta be one of the best foods (value wise) you can get on the strip. if they have the <mark>Holiday Turkey</mark> sandwhich, i absolutely recommend you try it. otherwise, you can't go wrong with <mark>The Original 1762 </mark> 1762 or the <mark>Chipotle <mark>Chicken Bacon Avocado</mark></mark> (when is that sandwhich ever bad?).\n\nthis place might be the only reason people visit planet hollywood anymore. and don't waste your time at pinks - opt for earl of sandwhich instead.", 
            "i usually hate sub sandwich places, but this is as good as it gets.\n\nwould stop by here after work sometimes, and grab a sandwich. my favorite is the <mark>Holiday Turkey</mark> one, it's actually the only one i get.\nit has turkey, cranberries, and stuffing jammed between two doughy pieces of bread, a match made in heaven.\nthe service is fast, despite how busy they get sometimes. i recommend everyone swing by this place and give it a whirl.", 
            "so i hardly frequent sandwich shops and going to this place makes me wonder why i don't go more often because this place has reignited my love for sandwich shops! and fyi the line is long for a reason.\n\nall of the sandwiches are hot with a delicious freshly made bread. they have many fun options to try such as <mark>Hawaiian BBQ</mark>, cannonballs (meatball sandwich lol), <mark>Chipotle <mark>Chicken Bacon Avocado</mark></mark>, and <mark>Holiday Turkey</mark> (complete with turkey, stuffing, gravy, and cranberries!) the prices are reasonable at 5.99-8.00 i think. yes, more expensive than subway but 5x better. \n\ni got the <mark>All American</mark>- turkey, cheddar, cranberries, lettuce, tomato, and ranch. sounds odd but so freakin' good. i want one right now...too bad vegas is 6 hours away. poop.", 
            "the <mark>Holiday Turkey</mark> was marvelous! i got a side of mac and cheese too! plus the <mark>Earl Grey Lemonade</mark> was a thing of crisp, deliciousness! i have to make my own now! i wanna try the rest of the sandwiches!  yummmmmmmm",

            "so any place with that many reviews and a great score demands a nod of interest. the wife and i have recently moved to las vegas from northern california. we are on the hunt for local good food. as we have recently discovered, any resident or local tries to stay the hell away from the strip.\n we had to run downtown today, and decided to grab a sandwich and watch the flocking tourist. as expected there was a decent line of approx. 15 people a head of us. we patient;y waited our turn and made our order. (cuban, <mark>Holiday Turkey</mark>, and the full mont.) we got out numbered pager, drinks, and headed into the packed dinning room for a table. we lucked out, grabbed a warm table that just lifted. \n  less than ten min. pass and our sandwiches are ready. i open the cuban first, warm, toasty and looked delicious. my wife had the <mark>Holiday Turkey</mark> that was just as good looking. the first bite for both of us was a religious experience, we put a lot of expectations into these sandwiches, and they did not fail to step up with a quality product. we shared all three and enjoyed each and every bite. my favorite was the <mark>Holiday Turkey</mark> that my wife ordered. it is that mid night sandwich you sneak into the kitchen on thanksgiving night to make when the family is asleep. we were unable to find a flaw with any of our choices. earl of sandwich we are new fans.\n so, hands down a great choice for lunch, dinner, midnight drunken snack to absorb the alcohol you have marinated yourself in all weekend.   \n enjoy people!!!", 
            "wow. i am so glad that one opened up in anaheim because i usually trek all the way to vegas for this hot deliciousness wrapped up in 2 pieces of bread. i highly reccomend the <mark>Holiday Turkey</mark>. it has stuffing, cranberry sauce, turkey and gravy allll in one sandwich. taste bud explosion. the tuna is amazing !! cold tuna, spread on 2 puffy pieces of bread and cheese melted to perfection. spicy italian, just like that all warm spicy meats sandwiched between 2 toasty buns !! i also have 1/2 a salad the cobb is perfect. cranberries, chunks of chicken, nuts, onions and ranch tossed in between crisp salad leaves. i love it here !",

            "worth the wait. line can be deceiving but it goes by quick, especially if you hit it up after a night of clubbing. this location is convenient bc it's 1) right across from marquee in the cosmo and 2) open 24 hours. price is reasonable, a one-entree bowl at the panda express in miracle mile is more expensive than a sandwich here!\n\nrecommendations: <mark>Chipotle <mark>Chicken Bacon Avocado</mark></mark> and <mark>Holiday Turkey</mark>. i have a couple friends who swear by the <mark>Tuna Melt</mark> too.\n\nearl's sandwiches are perfect to enjoy hot and fresh, or even cold - aka the other half of the sandwich you'll be eating in your hotel room the next morning. to me, earl's can do no wrong.", 
            "sandwiches hot or cold, you'll definitely love this place. only thing is the wait so be prepared to wait a while here. most i've waited was about 30 mins. reason why there's a wait because this place is that good if you enjoy a quick eat instead of going to the spice market buffet which is also good. even with the long wait, you won't have that of a hard time to find a table because place is on the go; they order, eat and leave so by the time your order is ready, a table should be ready for you as well. or the other option is to have another person reserve the seat while you order or vice versa. i haven't had much time waiting for my order after i've ordered and paid but i've seen other customers wait a while for their order either because of the confusion from the employees or just way too many people here. plenty of employees working here so not sure why some people have to wait so long for their order to show up. you'll notice also that sometimes they take orders in waves. first batch orders and then they'll wait a while before they take the next person's order in a way to not make the place too crowded. \n\ni've tried most of their sandwiches here. highlights for me are their <mark>Holiday Turkey</mark>, <mark>The Full Montagu </mark>, <mark>Chipotle <mark>Chicken Bacon Avocado</mark></mark> and their <mark>Hawaiian BBQ</mark>. i also recommend getting their tomato soup - one of the best i've had. not too salty and they fill it up with small pieces of bread. you won't be disappointed with their sandwiches here.", 
            "came for a late lunch and ordered the <mark>Chipotle <mark>Chicken Bacon Avocado</mark></mark> sandwich, it was just the right size and yummy.  better alternative to eating pizza or mcdonald's while on the strip.  my bf got <mark>The Earl's Club</mark> sandwich while my friend got the <mark>Holiday Turkey</mark>.  both sandwiches looked yummy.  \n\ncome to this place to keep the hungry monster away.", 
            "earl's!!!! i hadn't eaten here in years. well i just went two days ago and i am happy to say it is still the same :). my two girlfriends did not want to go (they are way more posh then me) so i went by myself. sadly the line was about 50+ in front of me. could you believe i still waited? first let me say, this is one of the cheapest places on the strip. their sandwiches are still priced at $6.50 a pop. i always order the <mark>Holiday Turkey</mark> which comes with cranberry sauce. omg. my mouth is watering right now as i write this... oh i also had the oatmeal raisin cookie to top it off (only $2) and that was phenomenal as well. if you have never experienced earl's, it is a must when you attend vegas. if you are reading this and debating it, just get off your phone and head over right now ;)", 
            "their avocado blt is amazing! they definitely do not skimp on the bacon, and the avocado adds a creamy kick to the whole sandwich. the bread is also to die for. thank god there's one in downtown disney, ca. at least i don't have to travel as far to experience this place again. \n\nhoping to try their chipotle chicken or <mark>Holiday Turkey</mark> sandwich the next time i go!", 
            "good sandwiches, late night quickie for food and not really a long wait. there's a quick turnaround to their dining tables and the lines to order move quick. \n\ni love earl's sandwiches. they have a lot of sandwiches but i've only been to earl's in vegas a handful of times. i liked their <mark>Holiday Turkey</mark> sandwich (turkey, stuffing, cranberry jam, etc). \n\nplanning on hitting up the earl of sandwich in downtown disney soon.", 
            "best sandwiches hands down! i was a little skeptical about what to order. my friend told me that the <mark>Holiday Turkey</mark> is really good but i'm not a big fan of turkey. it turned out delicious!! it was a interesting combination, a little sweet and a little salty. we also got a club sandwich, a salad, the chili and the loaded potato soup. both the chili and loaded potato soup was bomb!! i heard really good things about the cheddar broccoli soup, so i'm definitely going to have to go back and try it before i leave! <mark>The Earl's Club</mark> sandwich was just okay, but pretty full sandwich. lots of bacon and avocado.\nalthough the line can be long, it moves really quickly and the food comes relatively quickly as well. there was nothing special about the salad, my friend was just trying to be healthy. \n\nif you are in town, you must try this place!!", 
            "for both the las vegas strip location and downtown disney, earl's is one of the best and satisfying \"quick snacks\". during an afternoon of belligerent drinking or after a night of partying, grabbing a sandwich from here isn't a bad choice if you don't feel like having a $5 pizza. \n\nall the sandwiches i've tried have been pretty consistent: not bad, but nothing special. the two i particularly enjoy are the tuna and <mark>Holiday Turkey</mark>. i'm pretty picky about my tuna and this place rounds up a pretty decent melt.. chunky bites of tuna on their crispy artisan bread, too good.\nthe <mark>Holiday Turkey</mark> is probably one of my favorite sandwiches ever. i love all the ingredients that make up the sandwich: turkey, stuffing, gravy, and cranberry! thanksgiving in a sandwich. yummm! \n\nearl's also offer plenty of other snacks: wraps, soups, salads, chips, drinks, etc.. but all you really need is a sandwich and a complimentary cocktail from the casino, and you're all good!\n\nthis location is always busy, usually backed up with a line. i think it's definitely worth it though if you're hungry and looking for a cheap choice.", 
            "definitely a must when visiting vegas! you really can't go wrong with earl. it's cheap ($6-7 for any sandwich), open 24/7, and there are lots of options to choose from. my favorites are the <mark>Holiday Turkey</mark> (it's thanksgiving in a sandwich!) and <mark>The Original 1762 </mark> 1762.\n\nthe bread makes all the difference! it is perfectly toasted. at the other earl locations, you can choose from white or wheat bread, but at the vegas location, they only have white available (probably to speed up the ordering process since lines can get long).\n\nas many others have said, it's perfect for lunch, after a drunken night out, or a quick snack. if you're especially hungry, you might want to order two. the lines can get a little long sometimes, but it's totally worth it.", 
            "better than disneyland. \n\nlove the chipotle chicken and the <mark>Holiday Turkey</mark> :)", 
            "i've only had earl of sandwich a couple of times, but never had the holiday sandwich-and it's what i've been missing in my life. <mark>Holiday Turkey</mark>, stuffing, gravy & cranberry sauce, holy mother of sandwiches! now i dream about it in my sleep thank you very much christina y. \n\nit was crowded and a bit messy-hey, it's vegas. the service was nice and although the lavender <mark>Iced Tea</mark> was dry and empty-someone from the back grabbed our glasses and hooked us up. \n\na great stop on miracle mile for a reasonable bite-and oh that holiday sammie, more please", 
            "this place is legit shit. seriously. go here!! sandwiches here are absolutely fantastic and i'm not a sandwich fan at all, until all my friends that knew if the place told me to go here! they have a toaster similar to quiznos except better in my opinion and a really good variety of sandwiches, salads, soups, and even breakfast items and small dessert snacks. i had the tomato soup with extra croutons and my friend and i shared <mark>The Full Montagu </mark> and <mark>Holiday Turkey</mark>. it was creamy tomato soup and really tasty, i took the recommendation of extra croutons from another yelp review and don't regret it once so ever. ingredients in both sandwiches were very fresh and a good amount to pack enough flavor. i really enjoyed <mark>The Full Montagu </mark> but hell if the <mark>Holiday Turkey</mark> is available (bc apparently it isn't always around), get it!!!! it's literally thanksgiving packed into one sandwich with stuffing, cranberry sauce, turkey, mayo and gravy. freaking out of this world!!! i want to get another before leaving vegas! there's plenty if sandwich options. wish i was around long enough to explore the other options, but will always remember this place whenever visiting vegas.", 
            "line moves relatively fast so don't trip.\ngreat value for the food your getting (in respect to most of the places on the strip)\n\n- <mark>Chipotle <mark>Chicken Bacon Avocado</mark></mark> (grilled chicken, <mark>Bacon, Egg <mark>Ham 'N' Cheddar</mark></mark>, avocado, lettuce & chipotle sauce) is on point. you really can't go wrong with this.\n\n- <mark>Holiday Turkey</mark> (turkey, corn bread stuffing, cranberry sauce & mayonnaise) was good, but seemed to be lacking something. if i order again i'd probably ask for some red onions on it.", 
            "i love thanksgiving food. the <mark>Holiday Turkey</mark> is sooo good! like thanksgiving in the form of a sandwich. for $6.49 per sandwich, this is probably one of the cheapest, tastier meal options you'll find in the las vegas strip. lines moved promptly. i'm already planning of my return here before i hit the airport. i want to try some of their other delicious tasting sandwiches but damn that <mark>Holiday Turkey</mark> was bomb! i already know that's gonna be my last vegas meal. their cole slaw ($2.49) was ok. pretty good but not great.", 
            "i've always loved the earl of sandwich in downtown disney. so imagine my face when i found this location is only a walkway away from where we were staying. tears of happiness, guys. real tears.\n\nin all seriousness, earl of sandwich, located inside planet hollywood near pbr rock bar & grill, catered to me and my cousins' both drunk and sober needs -- and for the inexpensive price of $6.49 (as of sept. 7, 2014), might i add.\n\nmy \"gold bars\" from my last few visits include avocado blt and the <mark>Holiday Turkey</mark>.\n\nthe avocado blt is packed with a ton of itty bitty bits of bacon and a generous serving of avocado. with the toasted, crunchy bread and my addition of some grey poupon... ugh. just writing about it makes my stomach grumble.\n\nthe <mark>Holiday Turkey</mark> sandwich has the fixits of a leftover sandwich the day after thanksgiving. the sandwich includes slices of turkey, mayo, stuffing and cranberry sauce. really delicious! this sandwich is the epitome of filling your drunchies.\n\ni also managed to grab a side of their <mark>Potato Salad</mark>. it wasn't that great; it tasted what you'd expect in a <mark>Potato Salad</mark>. however, the portion is small for the price you're paying, so don't bother.\n\nthe staff here are a hit or miss. most of them are friendly, but during one of our visits, the lady taking our sandwich order literally didn't say a word. i told her my sandwich, and before i could ask for a side, she prints out my order receipt and took the next customer. uh, okay.\n\nall in all, earl of sandwich delivers a bang for your buck. huge props for keeping this place open 24 hours. if you need a bite and you're near planet hollywood, definitely give this place a try.", 
            "this used to be my favorite place to go in vegas. in fact, i would have rated it 5 stars just a year ago. however, the quality of the food has really gone downhill since then. \n\ni was here just a week ago, excited as usual to get my yummy <mark>Tuna Melt</mark> and <mark>Holiday Turkey</mark> sandwich to share with my sister. i noticed something as soon as i got the sandwiches, they were much smaller than usual. i have been to earl's more times than i can count. i've been to both this location and the one in downtown disney. so i knew for sure that something was off. i just thought to myself \"that's alright i guess, i don't need to be eating so much\". then i noticed that the sandwiches were barely toasted, in fact, the <mark>Holiday Turkey</mark> was almost white in color. what the hell? i took a bite of the <mark>Tuna Melt</mark> first. it was decent, but nowhere near as good as it used to be. there was definitely less cheese and it seemed drier than i remembered. the contents of the <mark>Holiday Turkey</mark> was still pretty good, but the bread just wasn't toasted enough. \n\ni'm just really sad that the quality of their product has gone down so much. i feel like whoever is higher up needs to realize that they are ruining their brand image by sacrificing the quality of their product for larger profit margins. not sure if i really want to come back to this location unless there's a change.", 
            "we stayed at ph and found this little gem of a sandwich shop! they are open 24/7. so good!!! especially the <mark>Holiday Turkey</mark> sandwich. my only complaint, there isn't a shop in san diego.", 
            "disappointed? yes. feel like my fellow yelpers duped me? yes. confused? you bet your ass!!\n\ndon't get me wrong the sandwiches here are alright but after seeing all of the rave reviews and 4.5 star overall rating i really do feel let down and expected way better than i got especially when they claim to be home of \"the worlds greatest hot sandwich\". if you put that claim out there your sandwiches better be pretty damn amazing. sadly, no.\n\n<mark>The Full Montagu </mark> (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/earl-of-sandwich-las-vegas?select=bck75axd_c6o9qcvsoe-pw#7njlum9t5acbtyzlqrdo3w) - $6.49. yeah, it was cheap and hot but also fairly small. the beef was a little under cooked for my liking but whatever, i know america likes their beef still moo'ing. no big deal yet then the salad was also really sparse too and nothing really had that much flavor. \n\nmy husband had the <mark>Holiday Turkey</mark> (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/earl-of-sandwich-las-vegas?select=bck75axd_c6o9qcvsoe-pw#__es78ie8zjeg61x_gtvww) - $6.49 which he said was and i quote ''fairly good''. he then went to on to tell me it was probably the best turkey and stuffing sandwich he's got from a sandwich shop but then this is only his 3rd so take that how you will.\n\nthe sad conclusion i came to here is that open a sandwich shop 24hrs a day in a location where drinking is one of the most popular activities and set your prices low you're guaranteed to get great reviews.", 
            "i wasn't sure what to expect before coming here, i read some of the reviews and they had raving reviews for the sandwiches. when i got here i saw what all the fuss was about. since it was vegas i thought that the sandwiches were going to be about $15 or so and you'd have to wait a while for it. but when i saw the menu, i was blown away the sandwiches were only $6.49 each (for most) and after we ordered our sandwiches and were given the buzzer vibrating reservationg thing, about 3 minutes later we got our order!\n\nwe had the <mark>Holiday Turkey</mark>, a earl club and a cup of clam chowder! they were all banging. starting with the <mark>Holiday Turkey</mark>, the bread was hot, soft and kinda buttery and it was stuffed with a whole <mark>Holiday Turkey</mark> meal, from cranberry jelly to the cornmeal stuffing. delish! the earl club was just as fantastic with the same delicious bread and great crispy bacon, its what a club sandwich should be like. the clam chowder was good too, not the best, but definitely not bad.\n\nthe portions were perfect too, if you ddin't want to be gluttonous, then the portion size is perfect, you should be full or almost full and if you wanted to stuff your face with dessert somewhere else or get some drinks after you still have room. \n\ndelicious,  cheap, and fast! doen'st get better than this for a quick bite right on  the middle of the strip!",

            "very much like joey in friends, one of my favorite things to eat are sandwiches.  i highly recommend earl of sandwich because it breaks the vegas monotony of over-priced food and large coma-inducing buffets.  the sandwiches here are very reasonable and this place is open 24 hours in the planet hollywood hotel.  it tends to get busy during lunch hour, so i recommend coming here later at night.  and when i say busy...it's a massive line.\n\nbut why come here?  oh only because their <mark>Holiday Turkey</mark> sandwich is the best!  imagine thanksgiving incorporated into one sandwich....that's the <mark>Holiday Turkey</mark> sandwich.  turkey, stuffing, gravy, and cranberry sauce sandwiched between two slices of perfectly cooked, crisp, freshly baked bread.  i don't even like stuffing or gravy...and i love this sandwich.  that's how good it is.  i also tried the mac and cheese side and the caprese sandwich, both of which are good as well.",

            "happy 2011 everyone!  hope everyone had a terrific ny celebration (nothing crazy and unsafe, yet extremely awesome and entertaining!)  now the new year is upon us, let me start off with a 5 star review for ya'll!\n\nearl of sandwich... i've never really been a sandwich fanatic and this was all the rage prior to my recent last trip to vegas by everyone i know and all the reviews posted on yelp.  on the day we were going to be leavin' lv i've decided to give it a shot by walking across the street for a quick brunch at earl's.\n\noh boy am i glad that i did just that!\n\nyou know... sandwiches are sandwiches.. nothing spectacular but nothing too horrible either... (a very safe type of food).  however, here at earl's it's absolutely incredible on how they can possibly make things tastes so good!\n\nagain due to my typical curiosity and the irresistible temptation on trying new things,  i've decided to almost but the entire menu for my food tasting lab i've set up in bellagio.  (i end up getting <mark>The Full Montagu </mark>, <mark>Hawaiian BBQ</mark>, caribbean jerk chicken, and the earl cobb salad.)  the sandwiches were $5.99 each with a decent portion (ain't the size of subway but quality is much much better!), and with two drinks the total came out to like $31 and change...(slightly pricey in my mind but gotta give it a try)\n\ni did share all this food with 3 other people though,,, so i not really the pig that i say i am.....\n\nso here were our thoughts...\n\n<mark>The Full Montagu </mark>:  great roast beef sandwich with turkey and swiss cheese... the roast beef was the real deal and it had the texture of soft arby's roast beef..... so taking that soft morsels that you call beef coupled with high quality you get an awesome sandwich!\n\n<mark>Hawaiian BBQ</mark>:  i didn't get to try this as my friend devoured it down in a quick few minutes... so i'm gonna take that gesture as awesome and leave it as that!  \n\njamaican jerk chicken:  jerk flavored chicken + roasted bell peppers in a jerk sauce made this sandwich really really delicious!  that's all i can tell you!  yum!\n\nhighlights of these sandwiches, the bread!  they toasted in a way where it's just the right moisture, the right texture, the right flavor, the right crispiness, and the right size overall!  it's just a really delicious bread to compliment all the dressings in between!  i've always believed that what makes a sandwich great is simply the bread itself, and earl of sandwich really proved that to be the main point!\n\nearl cobb:  aside from having slightly too much dressing that i would have liked (i always watch my dressing calorie count as this is the main trick in getting a salad), it was absolutely delicious!  i've have had many salads in various places, i gotta say that this is one of the more tasty salads for a fast food joint.  definitely worth the price!  (the people i was with weren't even into salads and they really enjoyed that too!)\n\nit's sort of weird that if you want ice tea you have to ask for it.... but you got the typical fountain drinks available for you (pepsi products)\n\none final note.... this place has recently updated their operational hours and it is now 24 hrs!!!  wow!  that's so awesome!  so you're telling me when i'm hungry late at night working on them slots, i can get myself a sandwich to go, sit down at the slot, blackjack machine, or anywhere to be gambling and eating at the same time?  i love vegas!!!\n\nso there you have it folks!  the first review of 2011 by yours truly and it is definitely a 5 stars in my mind.  so again hope everyone will be having a super duper 2011 and if you do visit vegas, may the money gods follow you to every machine/table you go to, and the sandwich gods guide you to earl of sandwich!", 
            "ate here a year ago and it left such a strong impression that i just can't quite get over it still, so much so that i still occasionally check to see if by some random miracle that an earl of sandwich might have opened somewhere near me.\n\nwe were starving around 1am after an early dinner buffet and spending hours in the casinos. we weren't up for wandering too far or spending too much more money on a late night snack, so earl of sandwich it was.\n\nwe got the the <mark>Hawaiian BBQ</mark>, cannonballs and carribean jerk chicken sandwiches and shared them among three people so that everyone could try everything. all three were amazing. the sandwiches aren't huge but the portions are perfect and i can't complain about the price for the quality. i didn't imagine a meatball sandwich that could stand out amongst all other meatball sandwiches but oh man, the earl of sandwich cannonballs meatball sandwich was amazing. i can't really describe what makes it so good, but it just was.\n\nfast, affordable, and open all the time. best sandwich place i've been to, hands down. hoping to come back to vegas soon to relive the glory (food-wise, not the losing money part.)",

            "what is there left to say when 653 other yelpers have already spilled the beans about the earl of sandwich? there was only one thing left to do which was to see what the hype was all about myself. \n\nthe place is located inside the planet hollywood across from the sports book. it's open 24/7 for all you lovely belligerent and drunk, 5 inch heels in hand meaning blackened hobbit feet, crusted yack on chin folks. the earl just might be your savior.\n\nfor a measly $5-6, you can get a nice, freshly made and toasted sandwich. there are many options to choose from such as the classic club to the <mark>Hawaiian BBQ</mark>. of course there are other items on the menu like their rich tomato soup (i recommend the croutons on the side), salads, wraps, and so forth. \n\nthe word about the earl of sandwich is out so don't go bezerk if you see a pessimistic long line. their efficient staff will keep the lines steadily moving and it shouldn't take too long for the orders to be called. the only downfall is possibly the seating for it may fill up quickly.\n\non our most recent trip to sin city, we stopped by earl's twice due to the fact that we stayed at ph and so it was always a short walk away. on a random note, i would like to state that for some odd reason i enjoyed the sandwiches from earl the next morning after it was left out over night more than straight out of the oven. perhaps it was the hangover munchies?\n\ngive the earl a hollar if you're ever in the (702) area code.",

            "this place is so good i ate here twice in a row for lunch out of the 4 days i was in vegas. they offer a large variety of hot sandwiches, salads, some wraps, and baked goods. the price is very reasonable which is great if you're on a budget. for about $8 i could get a nice sandwich and a drink with free refills! the bread is what really makes it for me, nice and warm and a little bit crispy. my bf got the <mark>Hawaiian BBQ</mark> sandwich both times because he said it was so good. i got the meatball sandwich one time and a turkey sandwich with cranberries, lettuce, <mark>Tomato</mark>, and some other things (i can't remember what it's called) which i would highly recommend. just a side note, their earl's <mark>Earl Grey Lemonade</mark> is an arnold palmer. i didn't know that the first time, but it was fine with me since i like them anyway!",

            "never before have i felt so noble in vegas for such a low price.  would one rather have a $2000 bottle service @ marquee, or 650 sandwiches from earl of sandwich (i.e. sandwiches for life)?  i would have to lean with the latter as every earl's delcicious, piping-hot sandwich i've had has been delicious  if you're a fan of freshly baked bread that's magically soft and tender on the insides, yet baked and firm on the outside, you have found your nirvana.  next, each sandwich is comprised of an ample amount of meat/lettuce/dressings/etc where each and every delightful bite is full of flavor and satisfaction.    if only they played edm....earl's would be borderline culinary bliss.\n\ntheir pricing is extremely competitive, especially for the vegas strip. each sandwich is priced @ $5.99, with additional costs for double meat (really not necessary).  another amazing aspect of earls? it\"s open 24 hours a day!!! which means, one can wander over there drunk, intoxicated, and eat probably the best tasting sandwich in drunken memory and then even bring one back in case you happen to throw up before the night.  unlike the other 24 hr joints, which tend to have long, inefficient waits, the line @ earls breezes through as they have an awesome system of those vibrating ringers that alerts you when your sandwich is ready.\n\nrecommendations: <mark>The Full Montagu </mark>, <mark>Hawaiian BBQ</mark>, <mark>The Earl's Club</mark> (only if you like bacon as it has a prominent taste in the sandwich).  \n\noverall, i think this how become my favorite place to eat in vegas and i would gladly recommend anyone who throughly enjoys hot sandwiches to eat here.  they do have veggie options for those who have decidedly to foolishly deprive themselves of meat :p",

            "never thought this would happen but i've discovered a couple sandwiches from earl of sandwich that i wasn't too crazy about!  don't get me wrong -- i still love the quality of the <mark>Tuna Melt</mark> which i always order, and then i get another sandwich that i save for later or take back to my man.  so far, a huuuge thumbs up for the <mark>Chipotle <mark>Chicken Bacon Avocado</mark></mark> and the earl club.  however, the <mark>Hawaiian BBQ</mark> and blt were kind of a disappointment.  i only ate half of each.  the bacon was too thick on the blt and for some reason smelled like peanut butter.  there's still so many more sandwiches for me to try though, so i'll definitely keep coming back when i go back to vegas. \n\nservice is still as quick as ever so don't be intimidated by a long line.  if ordering soup, check to make sure you got the right one!  they gave my friend the wrong soup and she didn't realize til we got back to our hotel room.", 
            "very meh. possibly hyped up due to yelp reviews...\n\ni tried the <mark>Chipotle <mark>Chicken Bacon Avocado</mark></mark>, and taste wise, it was just ok. the <mark>Chicken Bacon Avocado</mark> at safeway is an upgraded version of it in both taste and portion... and you can always just add some spicier sauce if you want a kick. also tried the <mark>Hawaiian BBQ</mark> sandwich. chicken was slightly dry and overall nothing special.\n\noverall, the portions were small and taste was average. if you compare to subway, then ya, taste is good... but i've easily had much better sandwiches for the same price.", 
            "the line looked pretty long when we first come but the food was prepared quite quickly. i would definitely recommend the cannonballs and <mark>Hawaiian BBQ</mark>! they taste amazing!! the other sandwiches taste pretty good too. i would say you can't go wrong ordering any kind of sandwiches here. the wraps are not that great though. that's why i give this place a four star.", 
            "every other time before this current trip to vegas i would have given earl's 5 stars. let me explain...i am a regular here in vegas coming about almost every 2-3 months. earls is my go to place every single time. one being they are right within the hotel i stay at (planet hollywood/elara), two being they are 24 hours, and number reason being they are the best sandwiches on earth! the <mark>Tuna Melt</mark> and <mark>Hawaiian BBQ</mark> are my top choices while i do very much enjoy all the other kinds! trust me i want to give this place five stars but here is what got me to give only 4. this current trip that i'm on i haven't had the best experience...apparently since they are open 24 hours they need to \"refresh\" their system (registers and what not) which is totally understandable. but they pick the worse time to do that...12 am, the time that most are heading to earls! and it causes this 10-15 minute wait which feels like forever when you're hungry!!!!!!!!!!! another reason for me is that even during regular hours of the day the service seems to be so much slower. i find myself constantly having to repeat my order cause it seems like they don't pay attention the first 3 times and they just seem out of it...then down the line the sandwiches are prepared much slower than usual and i notice this is because the employees spend too much time laughing and joking around causing (from my experience) a bunch of errors in orders and it takes so long for it to be ready! and it can get very frustrating! despite the delay sandwiches seems to have gotten smaller as far as the filling it's much more less than it use to be. over all yes i will continue to be a regular here and always be. i love love love love earls here at the planet hollywood but there can definitely be improvements!!!!", 
            "the line is usually long but i have to admit, their sandwiches are on point. i have tried the cannonballs, <mark>Hawaiian BBQ</mark> and jerk chicken. i thought the cannonballs were okay. its one dimensional, and you get tired of the overpowering flavor half way. howw ever i come back here for the hawaiian and jerk chicken, flavorful and just perfect. i love the toasted bread i think it makes the sandwiches so good. another downside is that it isn't as filling and you want to buy more but it's just so damn expensive. but its good and worth trying!", 
            "my favorite sandwich place!!! <mark>Hawaiian BBQ</mark> is my favorite!!!! love this place!", 
            "sandwiches hot or cold, you'll definitely love this place. only thing is the wait so be prepared to wait a while here. most i've waited was about 30 mins. reason why there's a wait because this place is that good if you enjoy a quick eat instead of going to the spice market buffet which is also good. even with the long wait, you won't have that of a hard time to find a table because place is on the go; they order, eat and leave so by the time your order is ready, a table should be ready for you as well. or the other option is to have another person reserve the seat while you order or vice versa. i haven't had much time waiting for my order after i've ordered and paid but i've seen other customers wait a while for their order either because of the confusion from the employees or just way too many people here. plenty of employees working here so not sure why some people have to wait so long for their order to show up. you'll notice also that sometimes they take orders in waves. first batch orders and then they'll wait a while before they take the next person's order in a way to not make the place too crowded. \n\ni've tried most of their sandwiches here. highlights for me are their <mark>Holiday Turkey</mark>, <mark>The Full Montagu </mark>, <mark>Chipotle <mark>Chicken Bacon Avocado</mark></mark> and their <mark>Hawaiian BBQ</mark>. i also recommend getting their tomato soup - one of the best i've had. not too salty and they fill it up with small pieces of bread. you won't be disappointed with their sandwiches here.",

            "there really isn't anything more to say that hasn't already been said.   heading to vegas for labor day weekend!  woo hoo!  party party?  well, yes that's a given.  but is it sad that one of the stops i am looking forward to making is the earl of sandwich?  24 hours a day 7 days a week of yummy sandwich goodness!\n\nbeen here at least four times and it has been consistently good every time.  and soo soo soo soo cheap!  can't believe i'm eating on the las vegas strip type of cheap!  my favorites - <mark>The Original 1762 </mark> 1762 (soo much roast beef), <mark>The Full Montagu </mark>, and the caribbean jerk chicken. i'm sure anything you order here will be great - but those are my favorites.  not just good at 4am when you're drunk, stumbling through the deserted miracle mile shops of ph (which, by the way-resembles some sort of zombie apocalypse 4am!) and still good at 5pm the next day before a night of drinking.  \n\nthe key is the quality of the bread, the meat, and sauces.  the competition needs to take a page out of earl of sandwich's playbook - quality over quantity.  generous portions of meat but not too much meat to overdo it. not like those other sandwich shops that just serve you the side of an animal piled up between two small slices of bread.  . earl of sandwich serves the perfect amounts of meat, sauce and <mark>Veggie</mark>.\n\nthe process is so streamline - the line may seem long but they have fulfillment down to a science so it moves fast.  place your order, listen for your number - done!\n\na word of advice - if you are a big eater - order two sandwiches.  i'm not saying they're small by any means - but they are soo good and go down so easily - you'll be craving another.  trust me.", 
            "earl of sandwich is located in the planet hollywood hotel. all the sandwiches are $5.99 (which is a steal in vegas). think quizno's but 100 times better in flavor and in quality. \n\nearl of sandwich offers several specialty sandwiches, all toasted on their famous artisan bread. when i first approached earl of sandwich, the line was wrapped around the corner, and i cringed, thinking i would have to wait an eternity before i could get my hands on one of their tasty sandwiches. \n\nto my surprise, the line went by quite quickly, and we got our food order within 10 minutes. not too shabby, especially with the mob that was surrounding the place.  \n\nhighlights:\n\nclub: turkey, bacon, lettuce tomato, sandwich sauce. subbed out sauce for their house mustard which is a mix of dijon and honey mustard. the sandwich was just plain good. the bacon was not too fatty and it added the perfect smokiness to the turkey. the crunch of the bread mixed with the meat and <mark>Veggie</mark> was a pure delight! this was my favorite sandwich of the day. \n\nmontagu: turkey, roast beef, lettuce, tomato, house mustard. i liked this sandwich too. there wasn't an overwhelming amount of meat, and again it all kind of worked together. \n\nitalian: this was also very good. typically, italian sandwiches (i.e. grinders) are way too salty for me because of all the different types of meat (which all tend to be on the salty side) to my surprise, the warm sandwich really hit the spot for me without making me run for a glass of water to wash down all the sodium. \n\nham egg and cheddar breakfast sandwich- i thought this breakfast sandwich was just ok. i definitely think that the other specialty sandwiches are better deal in price and in flavor. it was kinda bland, and i needed my special hot sauce to give it a zing. ($3.99)\n\nearl of sandwich was so good, that i went there twice in one visit (especially with all the good places vegas has to offer). it's definitely a good alternative if you're trying to stay on budget, without sacrificing flavor. \n\nhighly recommended!",

            "ohhh...i could just eat earl's bread by itself for days....warm, soft, thick and carbo-licious! the stuff in the middle of the sandwich was just the cherry on top. =)\n\ni shared the sandwiches family style with my friends and we tried <mark>The Original 1762 </mark>, <mark>The Full Montagu </mark> and the <mark>All American</mark>. i chose the <mark>All American</mark> because love cranberry with turkey. so delish! the seasonal special was a another turkey sandwich with cranberries and the fixin's. i was tempted to try that too! \n\nall the sandwiches were delicious and stuffed to the brim with meat and <mark>Veggie</mark>. i'm  not sure which one i liked the best, but i found that <mark>The Full Montagu </mark> and the <mark>All American</mark> tasted similar. <mark>The Original 1762 </mark> had a stronger taste to it due to the horse radish sauce. i totally could have just ate half of a sandwich and been full. the portion size is good. for about $5.99 per sandwich it's a great deal! the lined moved super fast and the sandwiches came out super fast too. they have their system totally down. \n\njust one thing to note, make sure that you check your recipe after you order and make sure it's what you really want. we originally ordered <mark>The Earl's Club</mark>, but the guy at the register put down <mark>The Full Montagu </mark> on our receipt and we were unwrapping our sandwich when we noticed the mix up. \n\ngood cheap eat in vegas! you don't see much of these so enjoy!",

(pre-club, post-club, day after)\n\nit's definitely not the \"world's greatest hot sandwich\" but it's tasty, cheap, quick and convenient. eat here if you don't feel like dropping $50 on buffet and want something better than mcdonalds.\n\ni recommend <mark>The Original 1762 </mark> 1762 and <mark>The Full Montagu </mark> sandwiches.\n\n--------------\n\noriginal 1762 - a little skimpy on the meat portions but flavorful throughout the sandwich with just the right amount of horse radish and cheese. (fyi- meat is not consistent. one of the sandwiches was medium rare and the other was well done). \n\n<mark>The Full Montagu </mark>- get this if you want <mark>Veggie</mark> and more bang for your buck. sandwich is about 1/4inch taller than the 1762.\n\n--------------\n\ntips:\n\n1. do not go 3 times in 24hours. you'll get sick of it and end up forcing it down or keeping it for later and eating it cold.\n\n2. visit after <mark>The Earl's Club</mark>. plenty of rowdy, drunk entertaining customers. \nhighlights include:  a drunk guy trying to fight two other drunk guys because he thought they were taking pictures of his ugly drunk gf, funny drunk pick up lines and lot's of people with food on their shirts.\n\n3. order a side of macaroni salad and put it inside your 1762.", 
            "must admit, this place does it stuff good, but i did only try two things. i got the tuna sandwich because my friend told me to. i asked for extra lettuce and <mark>Tomato</mark>, but they were kinda skimpy on that. one thing i don't like is that they don't ask what toppings you want on your sandwich. i want me more <mark>Veggie</mark>, goddarnittt!!! :-p but the sandwich was tasty. good size for me, but i was surprised my boyfriend or any guy would be satiated by a sandwich this size. \n\nmy boyfriend enjoyed <mark>The Earl's Club</mark> so much he ordered it both times we went.\n\nsecond time, i got the tomato soup. ooooooo my god. it was savory yet sweet and creamy and piping hot. the croutons they put in there stay crisp on the inside, although i wish they didn't put the croutons in before you even open your soup. \n\ngood price for vegas and good taste. i'm joining the earl's fans.\nhonestly wish i could have had it one last time before i left vegas...", 
            "i was excited to go to this often raved about place, but left with a good, so-so experience.\n\ni got <mark>The Full Montagu </mark> with the wisconsin cheddar soup, earl's lemonade and <mark>Cookie Bites</mark>. \n\nthe sandwich was tasty, but i found a little bland. for me, it could've use more condiments or sauce, but by the time i was eating, i was out of range of any. the roast beef was really good though, i can tell, but i could've done with either more or crisper <mark>Veggie</mark>. my preference. the bread is nice and toasted. \n\nthe wisconsin cheddar soup was ok. not a fan of cheese soups. i used it as a dip for my sandwich to give it more flavor. \n\nearl's lemonade was kind of watery tasting, but i figured i might have been either used to or expecting really strongly flavored drinks. i think a sweeter or more tea flavor would've been nice.\n\ni didn't like the <mark>Cookie Bites</mark>, i found them too dry and hard, but my boyfriend really like them. \n\nit's a tasty sandwich and meal overall, but the line is killer. i would eat there again if it weren't for the crowd.", 
            "the bread.\n\nfor $5.99, you get a medium size oven cooked sandwich, but the size is deceiving.  the bread is pretty dense, and fills you up fairly well, as opposed to subway or quiznos which is all air.\n\nthe bread is crowning feature of the sandwiches.  it isn't cooked until you order your sandwich, and then your sandwiched it put through what resembles a pizza oven.  the bread is crispy along the edges, and yummy.\n\ni wish they put more filling, and more <mark>Veggie</mark>, though.  i ordered the jerk chicken, and my mom ordered the <mark>Tuna Melt</mark>.  it seems like it would taste must better if the ratio of bread to stuffing was more balanced.  they probably can't over-stuff it though, in fear it wouldn't cook completely.  \n\nwhen i come here again, i'm going to probably order the full monague.  the pictures of it look delicious.",

            "i like this place because it is open 24 hours, you get your food fast (even if there's a line), and its a really filling sandwich for $6.\n\ni get the veggie sandwich and my hubby gets the <mark>Tuna Melt</mark> and adds on a few free <mark>Veggie</mark> (lettuce, red onion, roasted red peppers, chipotle sauce), and avocado ($.99 upcharge).  both are excellent, flavorful sandwiches.",

            "when my friend excitedly turned to me on the way to vegas and said, \"ooh i have to take you to earl's!\", i had no idea what a treat i'd be in for. \n\nmy first experience at earl of sandwich was pretty amazing. long line, but it moved rapidly; not much seating, but people always vacating periodically.  the highlight, of course was the food. i got the chipotle chicken avo and an <mark>Earl Grey Lemonade</mark>, my friend <mark>The Earl's Club</mark> and a tomato soup. we ended up swapping halves of the sandwiches, and so glad we did!\n\n<mark>The Earl's Club</mark> is buttery and moist and flavorful--crisp <mark>Veggie</mark> and crunchy bacon and yummy turkey. the chipotle chicken avo--wow.  it's moved onto the list of sandwiches that i will periodically crave randomly.  the chicken is super moist, the cheese, avocado, bacon, and lettuce balance perfectly with the slightly spicy chipotle sauce, and is all sandwiched between chewy and crusty artisan bread. \n\nfriend loved the tomato soup (she was fan from before) and my <mark>Earl Grey Lemonade</mark> was pretty good as far as arnold palmers go. \n\nsecond experience was after a hard night's partying and before a long charter bus ride back to la. i ordered on the phone for pick-up and was pleasantly surprised that it would only take 5 minutes for my sandwiches to be ready.  a short walk from the cosmopolitan, i was back in time with our sandwiches in time to make the bus.  we got the cca again (how could we not?!) and <mark>The Full Montagu </mark>... which, sadly paled in comparison to <mark>The Earl's Club</mark> from yesterday.  still hearty and filling, but in juxtaposition with the two others, just a tad bland.  \n\nwhen back in sin city, i will definitely hit up the earl again.  at this price and quality, i'd be a fool not to!  plus, it's open 24 hours--and offers some dangerously delectable looking desserts.",

            "earl of sandwich is definitely one of my favorite places to grab a nice hot sandwich. it's too bad that it's located within the strip. sure, it can be a great spot for tourists, but a terrible place for a local to hit up. the strip is never a fun place to travel to, especially during the peak dining hours. despite that, i guess i shouldn't complain though. the next closest location is over 1,000 miles away.\n\ni've been here a few times. never been disappointed once. here's a brief rundown on two things i tried:\n\n\"the full motagu - roasted beef, turkey, swiss & cheddar cheese, lettuce, roma tomato & earl's mustard.\" it's a more traditional tasting sandwich, but really hits the sweet spot if this is what you're in the mood for.\n\n\"<mark>All American</mark> - roasted turkey, buttermilk ranch, cranberries, sharp cheddar cheese, lettuce & tomato.\" this was one of my favorites. the addition of cranberries added a nice twist to the sandwich. it's somewhat comparable to the bobbie at capriotti's, except you don't feel like you went through a thanksgiving feast after eating it.\n\nprices are definitely very reasonable for a strip location. i'd think that these prices were for an off-strip location. a hot sandwich will run you about $6-8. add a cup of tomato soup with your sandwich and you're golden. this isn't a place i'd go out of my way for, but a sure stop every time i'm in the area.",

            "i am a regular to vegas and the vegas food scene, which is comprised mainly of: expensive gourmet dining ($120 and up for 2 range), or overpriced mediocre dining (chain restaurants such as outback, whose prices are inflated because of its \"on the strip\" location, and rainforest cafe) and cheap fast food joints (prices still inflated from what they'd normally charge if not on the strip.. the panda express, mc'dees, rubios, s'barro pizza). \n\non my last trip to vegas, i decided that i wouldn't be a sucker anymore. i wanted to have a good meal, at a reasonable price, and if i have to walk half the strip, then so be it. i searched on yelp and earl of sandwich came up. a deja-vu moment came back, since i've been to planet hollywood before and recalled having briefly seen this spot, not far after you enter the hotel/ casino. i trekked my way from mgm to ph, for this. worth the 82 degrees heat, and the 15 min walk. and alas, i can't place earl in any of the 3 categories of the vegas dining scene. i guess i am mentally creating a new category: good & cheap! (i believe earl's is a chain, but it's too good to be put in the same league as the other chain restaurants). \n\nit was just the 2 of us, but since i wanted to give a fair review of the food, we got 3 sandwiches for variety: <mark>The Full Montagu </mark>, the <mark><mark>Ham <mark>Turkey 'N' Swiss</mark></mark></mark> and the <mark>All American</mark>. <mark>The Full Montagu </mark> is my favorite, with just the right amount of meat (roast beef and turkey), 2 types of cheese (swiss and sharp cheddar) and a good slab of the house mustard sauce.the <mark>All American</mark> is like thanksgiving on a sandwich (it has cranberries, turkey, cheese). the ham and swiss is the most boring choice of the 3, but it's good quality ham n' cheese sandwich. \n\nyou do have to get chips or any other sides for additional cost, as they aren't included in the $5.95 price (for all sandwiches!). they get packed. but other than that, it's a solid spot.",

            "another 5 star review for this sandwich spot?! i guess so.\n\nwhen we got to earl of sandwich, the worst possible thing that could have happened, did. their system was down for 45 mins - 1 hour. which means no sandwiches for 45 mins - 1 hour. we kinda just stood around earl's hoping a miracle would happen & their system would magically start working again. wrong. even planet hollywood workers stood in line behind us thinking everything was fine until we said \"their system is down for 45 mins - 1 hour. do you know of any other good food places we could eat at?\" their response. \"no way! earl's is the only place we come for food.\" we didn't eat the whole day because we wanted to try the sandwiches, so we were pretty much starving. we couldn't wait, so we just ate at another local food spot for a quick fix.\n\nthe next day, we were able to finally try earl's. the line was huge. i mean, for a sandwich? is this line really necessary? yes. i can't really describe the feeling of this sandwich as it hit my taste buds. it was like a party in my mouth. i must say, the anticipation for this sandwich made it that much better. something about the bread completes this sandwich. i got the <mark>All American</mark>, & also tried the caribbean jerk, <mark>Tuna Melt</mark>, & original. they were all very delicious. for all you vegetarians out there, you need to try the <mark>Tuna Melt</mark>. also, their prices can't be beat! $5.99 for any hot sandwich.\n\ni was in vegas for 4 days, so trying out all the local top notch food spots was a must. since 4 days is not that long, you wouldn't think of going to the same food spot twice during your stay right? uhm, sure.. okay. ;)", 
            "okay i am not a big fan of sandwiches, and the only reason why i came here was because of the bf....but with that being said, i thought this place was pretty good!\n\nit is open 24 hours, but i don't know if this is good drunkard food, what with all the melted cheese and stuff....\nalthough there might be long line, the wait is not that bad and it moves fairly quickly!\n\nwhat we had:\n-<mark>Potato Salad</mark> in a cup: over priced (it is vegas) and not worth it\n-bag of chips: standard\n-loaded potato soup: i don't really know why i got soup in vegas, but i did, and it wasn't that great\n-montague: basically hella meat turkey staked on roast beef and the usual toppings: swiss cheese, tomato onion lettuce, etc this sandwich was very flavorful...beef plus turkey makes for a savory taste. \n-<mark>All American</mark>: this is the sandwich i highly recommend trying! turkey with cheese, lettuce tomato onions and the one ingredient that makes this sandwich so succulent is the cranberry jam! every time i bit into this sandwich it was like fireworks, like the scene from ratatouille where he envisions fireworks! yea like that!\n\nand a frozen lemonade: basically lemonade blended with ice! pretty good!\n\nsurprisingly the sandwiches were 5.99, a pretty decent price that you will find in vegas. \n\nso get in line and try this place!", 
            "after seeing all the 4 and 5 star reviews for this place, my friends and i knew we had to try it. i was debating between <mark>The Full Montagu </mark> and the <mark>All American</mark>: the <mark>All American</mark> won (this time) - loads of turkey, cranberry sauce, ranch dressing, lettuce, cheese and <mark>Tomato</mark>.\n\nthe sandwich was packed with fillings. my friend said, \"it tastes like thanksgiving\" and she definitely wasn't lying. one of the best parts about the sandwich was the bread: baked fresh everyday, it was crispy yet soft at the same time, and it really made the sandwich that much better.\n\nafter trying a bite of <mark>The Full Montagu </mark>, i think that sandwich would have been even better than the <mark>All American</mark>, which was good but not out of this world good.\n\nit was a cheap, filling lunch, and with so many options to choose from, everyone is bound to find something they like. i would absolutely come back again.", 
            "they say it's the world's best hot sandwich, and while i don't want to agree to give such high expectations - a spinoff of a panini, these are pretty damn good. \n \ni got the <mark>All American</mark> ( roasted turkey, buttermilk ranch, cranberries, sharp cheddar cheese, lettuce & roma <mark>Tomato</mark>). the bread was scrumptious, the bread:ingredient ratio was perfect (just enough bread for the inside ingredients) and i especially enjoyed the mix of cranberries.\n\nthe sandwiches were super affordable and i do plan to come again :)",

            "bomb sandwiches. another pro is the efficiency of ordering, grabbing what you want, then paying--similar to a cafeteria but upgraded because the sandwiches are just so damn good. the actual content of the sandwiches is nothing innovating, but the bread is really delicious. the perfect combination of crispy and bready-ness without being overpowering over the entire sandwich as a whole. really filling especially for the price. i've tried <mark>The Original 1762 </mark> and the <mark>All American</mark> and both were delicous. i've also tried their desserts and definitely think it's worth the extra $2 if you have a sweet tooth post-sandwich. overall, i give earl of sandwiches a 4 for being delicious and also inexpensive. the only downside is it is located on the strip within planet hollywood and that can be annoying to get to if you're a local (which i am). still delicious though :).",

            "you read the reviews and think, whatever it's just a sandwich place. but this sandwich is more than just a sandwich. it's an amazing experience between two slices of heavenly tasting bread. be sure you try it out if you're ever looking for food in the planet hollywood area. the mantugo was definitely one of my favorites (also got the <mark>All American</mark> and the cobb salad as a wrap). they were all pretty amazing and will definitely be back next time i'm in vegas.",

            "i'm not much of a sandwich lover, but this place makes me love their sandwiches! it's good...hot sandwiches with great ingredients that complements each other. there's always a long line, at least every time that i go. \nlocated in planet hollywood hotel, in the miracle mile shops area, across from abc souvenir shop. \nhighly recommend: <mark>All American</mark> turkey sandwich and chicken tortilla soup. \n<mark>The Full Montagu </mark> was good, but the cranberry sauce in the <mark>All American</mark> made it all the better. i want to try the chicken chipotle next time....but i love that cranberry sauce! :) \n\nit's worth a try!", 
            "this is actually a tricky place to review. on the one hand the <mark>All American</mark> is hands down my favorite sandwich in town (even better than the bobbie at capriotti's imo), but the other sandwiches at earls are really lacking. so basically for the <mark>All American</mark> alone i'd give earl 5 stars, but since that's really the only sandwich my bf and i have liked here, i'd have to drop it a 4.\n\nthe <mark>All American</mark> is the perfect mix of tangy, savory and sweet and the bread is always perfectly toasted. i'm getting so hungry just writing this review!\n\ndo be prepared for a loooong wait if you go during peak or near peak times. also if you're local, the drive, park and long walk to get to earl is a chore and has kept us from going more often.\n\ni was really happy to find out that there is another location at the palms (easier to get to), but i was thoroughly disappointed when we went. the ingredients were not as fresh and service was non-existent. it was like going to a completely different restaurant.and we wouldn't go back again.", 
            "would you believe my family and i spent $15 on a cab ride just to eat a $7 sammie? we decided we had to hit burgr also just to make the trip \"worth\" it, but i can tell you, the <mark>All American</mark> itself accomplished that. \n\nthe eating environment leaves something to be desired, but the execution of the american was perfect: a nice blend of savory turkey, melted cheese, fresh lettuce and <mark>Tomato</mark>, with an added dimension of sweetness, thanks to the cranberries. the ingredients are neatly arranged without the bread getting soggy or the flavors ever getting lost. how do they do it? \n\ni don't think the concept of a hot sandwich is that novel (i literally never eat cold sandwiches, but that could be because i'm asian?), and so the 5-star rating i'm giving surprises even myself. but then i remembered, this place is open 24/7. and it's cheap. and it's in vegas. even if you factor in cab fare, the earl earns every star.",

            "tasty sandwiches. friendly staff, quick service and very reasonable prices. tried : <mark>The Full Montagu </mark>, jamaican jerk chicken, <mark>All American</mark> and chipotle chicken - all of them had different taste but jamaican jerk chicken was unanimous favorite amongst everyone in the group. the bread is crisp but soft and the portion size is just right. highly recommended.",

            "i tried earl of sandwich when in vegas on vacation with my husband and friends. one of the girls we were with raved about this sand which place and how good it was. i was a little skeptical of it at first bc i just thought it was another place like subway. boy was i wrong! earl of sandwich is the best sandwich place i have had. potbelly s was my favorite before this place, but when i tried it it moved into first place. i had the <mark>All American</mark> on wheat. it had cranberry sauce and ranch dressing. at first i thought it was weird to have ranch dressing and cranberry sauce , but it worked out perfect and was really good. my husband had the <mark>Chipotle <mark>Chicken Bacon Avocado</mark></mark> without the avocado. he said it was really good. we truly enjoyed this little sandwich place.\n\ni would definitely get another sandwich from here when i come back to vegas !",

            "when i stayed at planet hollywood a few weeks ago, i often dined here. their sandwiches are the best i have ever had. you can tell how popular it is by the long, long lines that this place has. you can see the employees make your sandwiches are they give you a buzzer to let you know when your order is ready to be picked up at the counter. \n\ni've tried <mark>The Earl's Club</mark>, <mark>Chipotle <mark>Chicken Bacon Avocado</mark></mark>, and the <mark>Chicken Bacon Avocado</mark> wrap. my favorite is <mark>The Earl's Club</mark> (it's displayed on the huge board above the area where you place your order). they have salads, wraps, soups, side items (<mark>Pasta Salad</mark>, <mark>Potato Salad</mark>, chips, etc), and hot and cold sandwiches. i'd say stick with the hot sandwiches because you won't be able to get sandwiches like these. they wrapped them up in a paper foil that keeps it hot and warm for a long time. the sandwiches are so big that i always have to save the other half for later. \n\nwhat's another great perk about this place? there's free wifi!\n\ni can't wait to come back to las vegas. i will definitely frequent it whenever i'm in town.", 
            "earl of sandwich is one of the \"it spots\" of las vegas - and i can definitely understand the hype. for about $6-7 dollars, you get a delicious sandwich that will fill your tummy quite well before you start drinking the booze!\n\n- <mark>Tuna Melt</mark>: i'm not a big fan of tuna sandwiches, but oh goodness, this sandwich was just melt-in-your-mouth delicious! just make sure you have gum so you won't smell too fishy afterwards!\n- <mark>Chipotle <mark>Chicken Bacon Avocado</mark></mark>: i'm a big fan of chicken and avocado, so this was pretty much perfect. there was a good amount of sauce so the chipotle flavor wasn't too overpowering.\n- <mark>The Earl's Club</mark>: turkey, bacon, swiss, lettuce and tomato. basic sandwich, but tastes great!\n\nthere's always a line (and a pretty long one at that), but the line does move pretty fast. if you can't get a table, at least it's easy to carry back to your hotel room! sandwiches here are also a great for drunchies! ;)",

            "decided to head down to the strip and deal with the crowds. luckily it wasn't too crazy and the line moved pretty quickly. the wife and i decided to order 3 sandwiches to share. all 3 were really great sandwiches...the bread is amazing and i thought they portioned everything just right. it's not hard to eat a sandwich and a half but for food on the strip, the pricing is on point. \n\n<mark>The Full Montagu </mark> - i believe this is one of their staple sandwiches and that's for good reason. the turkey and roast beef are both tender and on their own, have great flavor. this sandwich came out with the perfect temp and both cheeses (aged swiss/sharp cheddar) were melted perfectly. they also add a killer mustard sauce which just made it even better.\n\n<mark>Chipotle <mark>Chicken Bacon Avocado</mark></mark> - my wife's favorite of the 3. large chunks of juicy chicken, a good amount of bacon and compared to most other sandwich joints, huge pieces of avocado. the chipotle sauce had great flavor and didn't overpower the sandwich which i really liked.\n\nthe italian - this was our least favorite of the 3 but still a good sandwich. the flavor was great but they put way too much italian dressing on it. my favorite part was the cheese, i am a cheese lover and they put huge slices of fresh mozzarella on here...amazing!\n\nthe bread was exactly the same on all 3 and it's definitely up their in the top for sandwich joints. it tastes fresh baked and it has perfect texture. it's a bit like ciabatta but without the crisp outside. chewy all the way through, taste good and super soft. just excellent bread!\n\nwe also had some sides...<mark>Potato Salad</mark> and a <mark>Fruit Cup</mark>. the <mark>Potato Salad</mark> was ok and the fruit was fresh but neither stood out except for the prices. they give you very small prepackaged cups of the sides and they cost $2.49 each. i wish i had tried the mac n cheese that everyone seems to rave about.\n\nwas this the best sandwich i ever ate? no...but they were definitely on the top and deserve every bit of the thousands of positive reviews they get. they do have quite a small seating area and i'm usually not big on going down to the strip just to eat, but i wouldn't hesitate going back for more. in my opinion, ph has some of the best spots for food on the strip and earl's is one of them.", 
            "sandwich? i was like \"uh sandwich? why?\" and then i took a bite of my <mark>Chipotle <mark>Chicken Bacon Avocado</mark></mark> sandwich and i could hear the chorus of angels all around me and i looked up with eyes that have just understood what you can't understand and i was like \"sandwich. i know why now.\" must go every time i stop by vegas. the line gets long and the sandwiches are perfect for lunch. just what i needed",

            "sandwiches hot or cold, you'll definitely love this place. only thing is the wait so be prepared to wait a while here. most i've waited was about 30 mins. reason why there's a wait because this place is that good if you enjoy a quick eat instead of going to the spice market buffet which is also good. even with the long wait, you won't have that of a hard time to find a table because place is on the go; they order, eat and leave so by the time your order is ready, a table should be ready for you as well. or the other option is to have another person reserve the seat while you order or vice versa. i haven't had much time waiting for my order after i've ordered and paid but i've seen other customers wait a while for their order either because of the confusion from the employees or just way too many people here. plenty of employees working here so not sure why some people have to wait so long for their order to show up. you'll notice also that sometimes they take orders in waves. first batch orders and then they'll wait a while before they take the next person's order in a way to not make the place too crowded. \n\ni've tried most of their sandwiches here. highlights for me are their <mark>Holiday Turkey</mark>, <mark>The Full Montagu </mark>, <mark>Chipotle <mark>Chicken Bacon Avocado</mark></mark> and their <mark>Hawaiian BBQ</mark>. i also recommend getting their tomato soup - one of the best i've had. not too salty and they fill it up with small pieces of bread. you won't be disappointed with their sandwiches here.", 
            "came for a late lunch and ordered the <mark>Chipotle <mark>Chicken Bacon Avocado</mark></mark> sandwich, it was just the right size and yummy.  better alternative to eating pizza or mcdonald's while on the strip.  my bf got <mark>The Earl's Club</mark> sandwich while my friend got the <mark>Holiday Turkey</mark>.  both sandwiches looked yummy.  \n\ncome to this place to keep the hungry monster away.",

            "so while checking yelp for some reasonable vegas fare, i came across a venue with like 3000+ reviews, 1 dollar sign, and 4+ stars.  check around, nothing else like it exists on the strip.  naturally, i had to go (mainly because i needed a break from $75 food bills for lunch).  \n\neos is good, really good.  there's a huge variety of sandwiches that are all delicious and easy on the wallet.  it's really close to about half the strip, and even if you need to take a $15 cab, you're going to save money in the long run.  there's a breakfast menu which is open until 11am (i never made it), but the rest of their hot sandwich menu suits me just fine. \n\ni had the <mark>Chipotle <mark>Chicken Bacon Avocado</mark></mark> thing, and later i had <mark>The Original 1762 </mark> 1786 or whatever.  <mark>The Original 1762 </mark> needed more sauce on the (the horseradish was great, but it needed more).  i got the chicken chipotle with extra sauce and it was awesome.  for like $7 a sandwich, you can't go wrong.\n\nnote:  the sandwich isn't huge.  i only needed one, but i don't eat a lot.  most dudes i hang with would need two to fill them up.  \n\nnote2: if you go for dinner, head into the ph and check out the pleasure pit.  you'll see.....", 
            "if you are looking for a cheap good place to eat in vegas, this is the place to go! it is conveniently located on the strip in planet hollywood right by the casino. there is always a line, but it goes by relatively quick. the dining area is somewhat small with limited tables and most of the time they are usually full. but luckily they package the sandwiches \"to go ready\" so you are able to eat them anywhere. \n\nthe first time i think i tried some of the ham and swiss sandwich and another one i could not remember. they were both good, but nothing out of the ordinary for the sandwich.\n\nthe second time i tried it i tried the <mark>Chipotle <mark>Chicken Bacon Avocado</mark></mark> which was amazing! i am one to not tolerate spiciness, but the chipotle sauce added just a kick of spiciness that was not too much. the bacon added some extra flavor to the sandwich. the sandwiches always come out hot and toasted on delicious bread.", 
            "finally got to trying this place after seeing it across the street from aria and i gotta say it was pretty amazing. the <mark>Chipotle <mark>Chicken Bacon Avocado</mark></mark> burger had a decent amount of avocado and the chipotle sauce just made everything go well with each other. the brocoli soup was alright though, nothing special. \n\nthe reason for three stars was the worker susana who acted like a total bitch the whole way. she literally threw the food at my boyfriend and when we told her our order was wrong she grabbed the bag, proceeded to making the salad (plus throwing all the ingredients in container) and threw the bag once again! but we weren't the only ones who had this problem. with a good place with good food, i think she really needs to fix her customer service skills.",

(and clearly this was life.)\n\nif i had known my sandwich was going to taste like a regular sandwich, i would have slept in and ordered room service. at least i would waited that forty-five minutes in bed. i still give this place a decent rating because the sandwich was decent. this is also a very good cheap food option in the strip.",

            "i had heard of this place many times before. it is the \"best sandwich\" you'll ever have, you \"have to eat here\", etc etc.   i thought i'd be let down because that's a lot of hype for just a sandwich shop but it met the hype and i want it now as i type this review!!\n\nlocation: this one is located at planet hollywood. ph is kind of big and i was still disoriented a bit but if you enter from the strip, walk through the casino and look for the big huge \"yolo's sign\" and earn of sandwich is right across from it. \n\nwe went around 1pm on friday and the line was kind of long but don't freak out because it goes really quick. you order your sandwich at the left and can pick up brownies and other things at the counter to the right. you pay there/give them your free brownie code and they'll give you a buzzer thing so you can find seating while you wait. \n\nwe went again on sunday around 11:30am/12pm and the line wrapped around the front of the restaurant. took maybe 10mins to order. both times after we paid, it took 5 -10 mins to get our food.  we were lucky both times and there was plenty of seating too. \n\nfood: since we were planning on going to a buffet for dinner, my bf and i split a <mark>Chipotle <mark>Chicken Bacon Avocado</mark></mark> - 6.49 (grilled chicken, <mark>Bacon, Egg <mark>Ham 'N' Cheddar</mark></mark>, avocado, lettuce & chipotle sauce).  omg it was so good. the cheese was perfectly melted and so gooey. the bread was toasted and the perfect amt of crisp on the outside and soft enough on the inside. the chicken was so moist and juicy and was a perfect combo of flavors with the avocado, bacon and sauce! the half sandwich was so not enough.. granite we were hungry and just did this to get us through the buffet but after i had the first bite i knew we'd have to come back before we left vegas. \n\nthe second time we went on sun- my bf got the <mark>Chipotle <mark>Chicken Bacon Avocado</mark></mark> again and i got <mark>The Full Montagu </mark> - 6.49 (roasted beef, turkey, swiss, cheddar, lettuce, tomato & mustard sauce). we both had half of each other's sandwiches and still hands down the cca was the better one. the fm was really good too though! that roast beef was so soft and juicy too! \n\nwe got a free brownie both times and it was good. it's more a cake-like brownie and i love those! i was thinking it would be too dense because they're triple chocolate but it was just right! totally tasted freshly baked, soft and a perfect way to end your meal. plus you can't beat free! \n\nfirst time to try it and i loved it. my friends told me they opened one in anaheim (about 45 mins from where i live in la) .... may be worth the drive for this place! it's def not \"just\" a sandwich like you know.. it's earned it's earl of sandwich title :d\n\nthank you yelpers for bringing this one up for cheap eats in vegas! worth it!\n\n\ntips and such\n---------------\nfull menu here: http://www.planethollywoodresort.com/content/dam/phv/dining/casual/earl-of-sandwich/eos-october-2013.pdf\n\nsign up for the mailing list for a free brownie: http://www.earlofsandwichusa.com/the-eclub/\n\nit took about a day to get the confirm email.  inside the email, there'll be a link to open that has a barcode for the cashier to scan for the free brownie.  we went twice while we were in vegas so we just split one brownie each time.  the first time, it didn't scan so they keyed it in. the second time we went i just showed it to them and they didn't bother scanning it. i'd get that brownie next time even if it wasn't free", 
            "finally tried this place! i didn't even know it was in our hotel!\n\nanyways, i got the <mark>Chipotle <mark>Chicken Bacon Avocado</mark></mark> club and was recommended the bbq pork. i ordered both for myself for the ride to the airport. \n\nthe chicken club was amazing! the bbq was just not enough pork. i took off half the bread and folded it. \n\ncan't wait to try more sandwiches!", 
            "line moved really quickly. they had a pretty organized system. they hand out a buzzer to let you know when your food is ready but by the time i was ready to pay my sandwich was done.\n\ni ordered the <mark>Tuna Melt</mark> and the <mark>Chipotle <mark>Chicken Bacon Avocado</mark></mark>. probably two of the best sandwiches i've ever had in my life. the <mark>Tuna Melt</mark> had melted cheese that was oozing with every bite. the chipotle sandwich is a must get and is made to perfection.", 
            "i ate here a long time ago but forgot to review this place.. the <mark>Chipotle <mark>Chicken Bacon Avocado</mark></mark> sandwich was really good, warm, and had a nice tangy sauce. the line was very long but went faster than i thought. take me back to las vegas!!", 
            "this place is a must-eat when you are in vegas. if you don't get earl's, your vegas trip is not complete!!\n\ni find comfort in their tomato soup, whether or not you're hungover or sad that you've lost money. the sour and creamy tomato soup will be the best pick-me-up! \n\n<mark>Chipotle <mark>Chicken Bacon Avocado</mark></mark>. <mark>Chipotle <mark>Chicken Bacon Avocado</mark></mark>. <mark>Chipotle <mark>Chicken Bacon Avocado</mark></mark>. say it a few more times so you will remember to get <mark>Chipotle <mark>Chicken Bacon Avocado</mark></mark>. if you are a fan of avocado, this is the sandwich for you. the savory chipotle sauce goes perfectly well with avocado and diced chicken breast. i can devour the entire thing in less than 5 minutes, not even kidding. then after that, i would go get another one for the long road back home. ahh okay now i want to go back to vegas just to get some more!", 
            "this place is amazing! it's not your average sandwich. their's so much flavor in every bite. i went in very open minded when we tried this place. i wasn't too sure what to expect but it def does live up to its expectations in my humble opinion. the <mark>Buffalo Chicken</mark> , italian, <mark>Chipotle <mark>Chicken Bacon Avocado</mark></mark>, and blt are all pretty amazing. both my boyfriend and i were hooked and kept coming back for more. i loved this place. if your in vegas on the strip, earl of sandwich is a must!", 
            "we always stop here when we go to vegas.  this is one of the best priced restaurants on the strip.  the food is good however depending upon what time you go there is a wait.  my husband was a bit disappointed in the breakfast sandwich, he felt it was to small but tasted good.  i got the <mark>Chipotle <mark>Chicken Bacon Avocado</mark></mark> chicken sandwich and it was good as usual.  will return next year when we take our yearly trip to vegas!", 
            "definitely not worth the hype. beware of long lines and wait time around the lunch hour. \nordered the baha salad and <mark>Chipotle <mark>Chicken Bacon Avocado</mark></mark> wrap and the order was confused. ended up picking up two sandwiches and had to wait for the order to be straightened out. \nthe food was good, but not worth the wait or hassle.", 
            "yuuuuum!!!! is all i can say. love love love this place. this place is located in planet hollywood in near the shops and casino. we went around noon on a sunday and there was a short line. waited only a couple minutes to get to the cashier. once we placed our order, we found a table and waited 5 minutes for our food. \n\nwe ordered the <mark>Chipotle <mark>Chicken Bacon Avocado</mark></mark> sandwich, the pastrami reuben and tortilla soup. both sandwiches were delicious! the sauce in the chicken chipotle sandwich was so tasty. it had a slight sweetness to it. and the pastrami in the reuben was very fresh. usually, you'll get a rubbery texture from pastrami at places like subway or togos but the pastrami here was much like ike's (if you've ever had it). it was easy to bite through. and the tortilla soup was sooo tasty. so many flavors going on in there! and the tortilla chips on too add a nice crunch to the soup. we dipped our sandwiches in the soup from time to time and it tasted delicious. \n\ngreat place to go to if you want a satifying fulfilling meal at an affordable price. will definitely come back to try the other items on the menu :)", 
            "one word...delish! i had the <mark>Chipotle <mark>Chicken Bacon Avocado</mark></mark> sandwich. it was slightly spicy, but not overpowering. the atmosphere is very casual. price is awesome, since the quality of food is so good. you order at the counter and they give you a buzzer. i like table service better, but cannot beat the price and food. in planet hollywood casino.", 
            "yaaaay first post as a yelp elite!! :d so why not write a review on my favorite food! i know some people think it's lame that sandwiches are my favorite food, but i love them because you can put just about anything into them, they can be healthy and delicious simultaneously, they are easy to make, they can hit all the food groups in the food pyramid, the list goes on and on! anyway, so with that said, i typically don't like going to sandwich places unless i'm shortchanged on time and want something quick, affordable, and healthier than fast food. because i love them so, i am very, very particular about my sandwiches. remember that episode from the big bang theory where sheldon orders a sandwich? \n\nsheldon: well, this sandwich is an unmitigated disaster. i asked for turkey and roast beef with lettuce and swiss on whole wheat.\nraj: what did they give you?\nsheldon: turkey and roast beef with swiss and lettuce on whole wheat.\n*the guys look at sheldon*\nsheldon: it's the right ingredients but in the wrong order. in a proper sandwich, the cheese is adjacent to the bread to create a moisture barrier against the lettuce. they might as well have dragged this thing through a car wash.\n\nthat is me. i am sandwich nazi. i know how i like my favorite food. \n\ndespite all that, i thoroughly enjoyed earl of sandwich. i came here halloween night with a group of friends who were shocked i had never been here before and wanted me to try it out. thank you friends for making me try it! i've been wanting to try earl's for the longest time. \n\nsandwich: i ordered the <mark>Chipotle <mark>Chicken Bacon Avocado</mark></mark> ($6.49). it comes with grilled chicken, bacon, chedder, avocado, lettuce, and chipotle sauce. the ratio of all the items in the sandwich is perfect. i had a good amount of chicken to fruit/vegetable (avocado is a fruit) to bread. the flavor was just the right amount - not too strong but not unnoticed. my favorite part of the sandwich was the bread because it was atypical. it was toasted crispy and chewy. while i enjoyed the sandwich, it is not near the best i've ever had, and i do think the portions could've been larger. but for what it's worth, i'm not complaining, as i would come back again. what makes this place great to me is that the sandwiches taste fresh, all the ingredients are good, and there isn't too much bread to overpower everything. and in this case, the bread actually isn't expendable. a lot of sandwich places give humongous loaves of bread with few ingredients in between that when you get to the ends, you just want to throw away chunks of bread. not here. each bite of bread is savored. \n\nvenue: this would be my biggest negative. everything involving the restaurant itself was great - clean tables, friendly staff, easy to read menus, a beautiful display of freshly baked goods, etc. but getting here is a hassle. after you get to the parking lot, it's still a 5-10 minute walk through the planet hollywood shops to the restaurant itself. add to that the line you'll likely have to wait in. even then, that's not the worst of it.  i'm somewhat obsessive compulsive about cleanliness and germs. heck i've made programs for elementary schools preaching the importance of hand washing. sooo, i strongly disliked the lack of availability in hand washing facilities considering sandwiches are meant to be held by your bare hands. there is no bathroom associated with the restaurant. you have to head out and find a hotel bathroom, and it's not nearby. there were no hand sanitizers that i was made aware of. i made do by forming a napkin barrier between my hands and sandwich, but it just wasn't very convenient. the one plus about this venue is that it's 24 hours. \n\noverall, if i was already at planet hollywood or maybe i just had a long night out with friends, i would swing by earl's and grab a sandwich. but because of the inconvenience in getting here, and the fact that sandwiches aren't too hard to make, i don't see myself coming here often. in fact one of my friends in the party, who was ranting and raving about how delicious the sandwiches at earl's were, even admitted to me that the last time he'd been here was 4 years ago. if earl's branched out i'd go more often. thanks, earl's, for providing me a nutritious meal after a long night of dancing.", 
            "i an not a sandwich lover but this place make me scream to eat them everyday if i could! the best sandwich spot i've been to thus far out of my whole life! the first time i ate here was when i first came to vegas and i just couldn't get enough! so now every time i'm in vegas it's one of my go to spots! my ultimate favorite is the <mark>Chipotle <mark>Chicken Bacon Avocado</mark></mark> chipotle! it's the only one i get there now! just the combination of all three make this sandwich great! it is definitely a must try for everyone in vegas! they will not disappoint! i'm a fan!", 
            "after returning to earl of sandwich last night for a quick bite with a friend after an event in the miracle mile shops i came to a realization. these sandwiches are really only okay, but they may be much better than okay if you are drunk and have been roaming the strip all night.\n\ni don't think much has changed since they opened, it is the same line-up (lots of people) eating there a majority of the time. there was a line when my friend and i ate here around 7:30 pm on a thursday night. you get a buzzer and you then can find a table or stand around if you are taking your sandwich to go.\n\ni had the <mark>Chicken Bacon Avocado</mark>, which had a good part and a not so good part. good part was the chipotle mayo on it was actually spicy and had a great taste. the bad part was there was hardly any avocado - a huge disappointment for me. also, the sandwich i now have realized is not as amazing as it seems. really, it's just another sandwich, and to be honest, it is smaller than most other sandwiches you will receive at other sub shops.\n\nprobably won't be venturing here again.", 
            "pretty damn good! small but very filling. the sandwich (<mark>Chipotle <mark>Chicken Bacon Avocado</mark></mark>) was fresh and hot, great taste. just enough of each ingredient; balanced. the bread was fresh and soft too! the price is cheap, but it's a far from cheap sandwich!", 
            "this past vegas trip i went on for a friends' birthday, i had earls three days in a row. you'd think i would be sick of it but i wasn't! it made my stomach happy but more importantly, it made my wallet happier (darn school loans).\n\nlocated at the miracle mile shops in planet hollywood. you get in line, order your food, pay at the end, and grab a buzzer. when that buzzer starts vibrating, it'll be the best feeling in the world because your food is ready! they have plenty of sandwiches to choose from and sides as well. from <mark>Pasta Salad</mark> and <mark>Potato Salad</mark> to cookies and chips, pick your poison. the prices here are really inexpensive and affordable, which is great since you're going to be blowing your money on other things. like teeflii, it's open for 24 hourzzz\n\ni should probably try new things but my go-to sandwich here is the <mark>Chipotle <mark>Chicken Bacon Avocado</mark></mark> hot sandwich. zomg hands down my favorite sandwich. you really can't go wrong with chipotle, chicken, and avocado. it's a very hearty sandwich with loads of flavors that will make your taste buds go wild. i also tried one of the breakfast sandwiches, it's called the egg white avocado bagel thin (?) something like that. honestly, it wasn't that great; it was very plain and bland but it got the job done and \"healthy\". i'd stick to their specialty sandwiches!\n\nearls is perfect for lunch, dinner, or the late night drunchies.", 
            "considering there isn't many cheap and good places to eat for your average college student just trying to have a good time in vegas, i had to give this place 5 stars. and yes, this is a sober review.\n\ni appreciated how efficient the customer service was. when i first got the sandwich, i thought it was relatively small but it was actually pretty filling!\n\ni tried the <mark>Chipotle <mark>Chicken Bacon Avocado</mark></mark> and the <mark>Holiday Turkey</mark> sandwhich. there were both reallyyyyyy good. loved how they were hot sandwiches as the bread was toasted to perfection.\n\nhowever, if i had to choose between the two again, i would just get the <mark>Chipotle <mark>Chicken Bacon Avocado</mark></mark> sandwich because i think the ingredients in this sandwich went really well together.\n\n4.5 stars for their quality of food and price. now i know why it's wrapped in gold foil.", 
            "why does this place have such good reviews!? these are regular sandwiches that you could get just about anywhere else. we got <mark>The Earl's Club</mark> and <mark>Chipotle <mark>Chicken Bacon Avocado</mark></mark> and were expecting something out of this world based on the reviews and the food turned out to be just ok. i guess compared to other restaurants this place is cheap so maybe that's what the attraction is because the food definitely isn't.", 
            "located inside the planet hollywood, i finally got to try the famous earl of sandwich.  oddly enough, i live in the la area and never got around to trying the one in downtown disney.  the line was long when we got here mid-afternoon, but it was moving at a decent pace.  this place is open 24 hours, which is pretty awesome.  the service was awesome and the staff answers any of your questions in a friendly manner.  \n\nthe sandwiches are cut in half already, so it's perfect for sharing two different types like i did with one of my friends.

            "the thing about food places that are open really late or 24 hours is that half of their customers are drunks feeding their drunchies (drunk munchies) or hungover. the problem with people eating food when they're drunk or hungover is that taste buds are heightened so food tastes so much better than it would if you were sober or not drinking the night before. that being said i thought my sandwich was amazing. full disclosure: i was drunk when i ate it. who knows what i would have thought if i ate it while sober.\n\ni split the <mark>Chipotle <mark>Chicken Bacon Avocado</mark></mark> with a friend because there's an earl of sandwich close to home in anaheim and i've seen those gold bricks sandwiches on instagram posts which looked larger than life. i regret that decision and wish i'd gotten my own sandwich because i devoured that half sandwich. we got chipotle sauce on the side because i put sauce only if the sandwich is bland. surprise surprise it wasn't bland and i ended up not using any of the chipotle sauce at all. bacon was crunchy and perfect. the mac and cheese was amazing. my drunk self decided to put the mac and cheese in the sandwich and it was a flavor explosion.\n\nthe line goes right out of the store and next to gambling tables. this line moves slowly because on a summer saturday night/sunday morning at 3 am there was only one cashier. if you're an attractive female coming straight from <mark>The Earl's Club</mark> in a dress and heels, the gamblers at the table will look and stare at you to the point that it would make even an intoxicated person uncomfortable. best to look away and ignore them. you've been warned.",

            "\"what do you guys want to eat?\"\n\"let's go to earl's!\"\nthis is the usual convo my friends and i have whenever we are in vegas. recently, we stayed in planet hollywood for 3 days and every single meal of mine revolved around this place. no regrets!\n\nyou can't go wrong with any of their affordable signature hot sandwiches or wraps. what makes the sandwiches so amazing to me, is the bread. my favorite sandwiches are the <mark>Hawaiian BBQ</mark> (chicken, ham, pineapple, swiss & bbq sauce) and <mark>Chipotle <mark>Chicken Bacon Avocado</mark></mark> (chicken, bacon, avo, cheddar, lettuce & chipotle sauce.) since i was there for 3 days, i decided to switch up on the sandwiches and tried the wraps. the <mark>Buffalo Chicken</mark> wrap is pretty good, but my favorite is the <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> wrap (without olives!) what makes it so delicious are the banana peppers, chipotle sauce and balsamic vinaigrette all up in there. i can never finish the whole thing, so i'm glad they always cut them in half for me to eat later. the wraps are great leftovers; the hot sandwiches aren't as good cold, but saving them for later comes in handy after coming back to the hotel hungry from a night of partying. \n\nthe line to order can be pretty long at times, but don't be intimidated because it moves quickly. after ordering, they give you a buzzer that will let you know when your order is ready. the dining area is pretty small for such a popular place, so i usually take my order to go. \n\nthey also have options for soup, salads, breakfast sandwiches and dessert: cookies, chips and brownies. i have yet to try the breakfast sandwiches, but i sure will next time. besides the food and affordable prices, the other best thing about earl's is that it's open 24 hours!",

            "i feel like the last kid on the block to finally get a pair of the <mark>Hot Tea</mark> high-tops (or should i say trying out the much talked about earl).\n\nwe were passing back through vegas on our epic weekend in utah, and we decided to spend a night in vegas (believe me it was hard to leave the next day) the only request i had besides hitting up a buffet and laying out at the pool with a drink is to stop at earl's and have a sandwich.\n\nwith that in mind, we all planned to hit this place up for lunch the next day! \n\nearl is easy to locate, half in the ph casino/half in the miracle mile mall. \nwe arrived about 1:00ish and there was a small line, it moved fast which was good. trying to decide on what to order became a picked as fast as possible which is never an option for me since i saw four sandwiches that interested me!\n\ntheir menu has plenty to pick from along with salads and wraps. \ngoing on the more \"healthy\" route i picked a wrap, now which one to choose from (oh the choices).\n\na tiny part of me really wished they could have made the jerk chicken sandwich into a wrap, but they pretty much only can make salads into wraps (boo)! \n\nthe cashiers are fast yet friendly. if you have a question, they are more than happy to answer it for you!\n\nit was our turn and i placed my order:\n\nthe <mark>Earl's Cobb</mark> wrap-grilled chicken, smoked bacon, swiss and sharp cheddar cheese, roma <mark>Tomato</mark>, cucumber, cranberries and buttermilk ranch dressing.\n\ni opted not to have the swiss cheese (not a fan). \n\ntossed in some bbq kettle chips and i was good to go, minh grabbed our number, and a drink and we were off to find a table. \n\ndid not take us too long to find a place for the four of us to sit at. getting our sandwich and wrap did not take too long either.\n\nbefore i knew it, i had my much-awaited wrap sitting in front of me bagging to be open. i have to admit that i  had a \"willy wonka\" moment peeling back the golden paper. \n\nsitting inside the golden paper was a delicious wrap filled with all the goodies; i could not take it anymore. i had to take a bite or two. \n\nbite one... wow this is scrumdiddlyumptious! but oh no my chicken and lettuce fell out the back end of my wrap, the bf was super sweet to stop eating to go and get me a fork so i could eat what fell out. \n\nbite two... i loved the cranberries in the wrap; it gave it a subtle sweet kick. the ranch was prefect in the amount they gave you.\n\nand yes, there was plenty of chicken, cheese, and bacon with every bite!\n\nthe chips are good too, not to greasy but more of a lighter taste with a whole lot of flavor and crunch!\n\ni left not feeling overly full, but just the right amount of being satisfied! \n\n\ncannot wait until their new location in anaheim opens! it will be earltastic!!!", 
            "are you in line right now asking your hungover or tipsy bff, \"what are you getting? what should i get?\" \n\nlet me make your happy life even easier - get <mark>The Full Montagu </mark>. \n\nthere are enough reviews about the sammiches so i'll talk about their new salad menu - tis' awesome!!!\n\ni highly recommend picking up a salad with your sammich- your immune system needs some freshly tossed greens and protein so you young souls can twerk/untz even harder this weekend. \n\ni've tried the berry, chicken and almond salad cus i was looking for something tangy and refreshing and it was delicious. go for the <mark>Earl's Cobb</mark> salad if you're feeling savory - there's bacon in there, life's always better with bacon.\n\ni also like to layer some of the leafy greens into my sandwich - makes everything that much more refreshing, especially if you're here for lunch. the fresh crisp texture of the greens adds awesome to the already awesome sammich.\n\nyou should also consider ordering a second sammich to-go. tastes great even when cold and it makes the best bedding for your tummy before your crazy adventure time. the nights when you have absolutely no time to grab a bite because you're on a guest list and your promoter says you gotta be in line by 8:30pm sharp.\n\nhave an awesome adventure time and cheers!", 
            "i'm so sad. earl of sandwich has definitely downgraded from the glory it used to be!\n\ni came here on my last trip to vegas, only to find out that earl is now only a shadow of his former self. \n\nlet me interject with some background history: i frequented vegas when i lived in southern california. when i say frequent, i mean at least once a month. i know vegas like the back of my hand: i can tell you what hotels are located where, and what time each of the nightclubs' guestlists close. i was very familiar with earl's menu. drunkenly slurring out an order for the <mark>Earl's Cobb</mark> wrap, debating over the <mark>Potato Salad</mark> in the fridge, with my heels in hand at 4 am in the morning - that was my thing!\n\nso on my most recent trip, i happily approached the cashier at earl's, announcing that i would like to order the earl cobb wrap. this was what i had been looking forward to all night, post-clubbing. not squeezing myself into a dress, not enjoying the live dj performing at a million or billion dollar club or whatever, but shoving earl's in my face drunkenly after a night of dancing. \n\nthen the cashier said the words that absolutely broke my heart: \"we don't have the earl cobb wrap\".\n\ni stared agape at him. the wrap that i had eaten loyally for 4 years straight on my every trip was gone?! just like that?! \n\ni spent a while in disbelief, drunkenly lamenting my sadness to mr.cashier before reluctantly ordering a chinese chicken wrap and making my way down the queue. \n\nwalking through the line, i brightened up at the thought of at least getting my <mark>Potato Salad</mark>. i peered into the refridgerator. and my spirits plummetted once again. what was once a generous portion of <mark>Potato Salad</mark> (think 6 oz) was now 2-3 oz! the same applied for the yogurt parfait - it was half the size it used to be! and surprise surprise, the prices were still the same original prices.\n\nby the time i get to the front cashier (where customers pay), i was one sad, drunken lady. i shook the <mark>Potato Salad</mark> in mr. 2nd cashier,'s face, demanding \"why! why did you make this smaller? what happened!!\"\n\nmr. 2nd cashier responded tonelessly (he was probably used to these reactions), \"corporate happened.\"\n\nwhen i received my wrap, instead of the wheat pita bread earl's wraps used to use, it was some stupid flour tortilla. dry and definitely did not soften the loss of my beloved earl cobb wrap. bleh.\n\nand so, i shake my fist as i angrilly write this review. darn you, corporate, darn you! how dare you take away what was once magical about earl of sandwich!",

            "we came to \"the earl\" by accident. first we were in another casino, i really can't remember which one and it was past \"dinner\" time but we hadn't really eaten dinner so we wanted something to eat.  we looked up and saw a sign for a deli type place and it was actually called \"snacks\".  we got in line at snacks and it didn't move for like 5 minutes, which when you're drunk and you want fries that's way too long!  plus the prices at snacks were ridic.  so we said screw it, let's go somewhere else.  somehow we ended up at planet hollywood and were looking for somewhere to get food.  that's how we found the earl.  \n\nso we walk up to the counter, i didn't even notice the prices until after i ordered.  great prices for vegas!  so i ordered like a <mark>Grilled Cheese</mark> type sandwich and my friend ordered a tuna wrap.  both were delicious!  i must admit that cheese in my sandwich was probably not a good idea a little later that night but that doesn't change the fact that the sandwich was really outstanding!  and cheap! and fast!   i'm really even lucky i remember what this place was even called!  oh vegas...", 
            "one of my friends suggested this place for our late lunch after arriving in vegas since she had been here before. she couldn't remember exactly where it was located and the directory said it was inside the hotel and casino so we went inside running around trying to find it. if you want to try this place, enter from the shops entrance and keep walking straight, you'll eventually run into it.\n\ni ordered the caprese salad since i had a pb&j sandwich on the plane already but i tried a little big of my friend's <mark>The Earl's Club</mark> sandwich and oh man, it was so good! the sandwich was hot, the bread was so soft, and the sauce had a little bit of sweetness which made for a great burst of flavor. my  other friend ordered the earl cobb salad wrap and that looked pretty good too. she also got the tomato soup which came with croutons already in the soup. i'm not a big tomato soup fan unless there's a <mark>Grilled Cheese</mark> sandwich for me to dip into, but i tried a piece of the croutons with the soup on it and man, i think it was the best tomato soup i've ever tried. i don't even like tomato soup! how about that for good food? my other friend had the caribbean jerk chicken sandwich which also looked good as well. i will definitely come back to this place next time i'm in vegas and make sure not to eat before coming because i want one of the sandwiches and the tomato soup as well. try this place! you'll love it!", 
            "second time here. <mark>Grilled Cheese</mark> for my four year old - ok, but not great. italian for my wife - excellent sandwich. <mark>The Original 1762 </mark> sandwich for me - good plain, but really good with a little dash of salt and some grey poupon - which they have available there.  in new york, this place would only rate a three or four star, but being that this is in vegas, and it's relatively inexpensive, i will go ahead and give them all five stars.\n\ni would like to point out that this review was during my third trip to vegas this year.  i don't particularly like vegas, and all three of my trips were related to me needing to go to vegas for the sake of other people.  in general the food in vegas at this price point is terrible, so i was really happy to find a casual, inexpensive, relatively not so artery clogging option.  \n\nyes, you can pay much more and go to a nicer restaurant, but that option is $30+ per person ($45+ if you want a drink or two).  at the $30+/$45+ (no booze/booze) price point, i've been to a couple of nice restaurants in vegas and from the numerous favorable yelp reviews, i don't think decent to very good food at the higher price point is much of a challenge.  i don't know about great food like you can fine in san fran or ny, but pretty good food nonetheless.\n\nalso, i suggest that you avoid the buffets, even the pricier & nicer one - i don't care which buffet you go to, the food will be meh at best.  i speak from experience, my fellow yelp friends.\n\nlast thing i want to point out about the earl - there is a convenience store right around the corner where you can buy booze (hard liquor and beer singles) at a relatively good price.  if you want a drink, i would suggest that you pick it up at the convenience store before you get in line at the earl.", 
            "alright, i guess i'll finally post a review of good old earl of sandwich. my biggest issue with this place and my only true gripe is that they removed my favorite sandwich and every time i ask they tell me they have no clue why. for anyone who has had the ultimate <mark>Grilled Cheese</mark> you will know why i am so upset that i knocked a full star off. i've been to this place at least 25-30 times and ever since they took this sandwich off the menu my heart has been bleeding for it to return. \n\nuntil this returns to the menu i will be forced to eat only semi-amazing sandwiches and cry in the fetal position in front of the cash register until security carts me off. you'd think i would be banned after doing this 5 times but i guess i have a forgettable face. bring back the ultimate <mark>Grilled Cheese</mark>.", 
            "delicious and cheap!  only $45 for a family of 5!  loved the italian.  kids <mark>Grilled Cheese</mark> was not very cheesy.  the others enjoyed their meatball, club, and kids <mark>Pizza Sandwich</mark>.", 
            "i'm not a huge sandwich person... but you wouldn't know it whenever i stay at planet hollywood.  i literally want eos for every meal.  the bread they make and use is so fresh and perfect with every sandwich.  a smaller bun is used for their breakfast sandwiches... but hits the spot, all the same.  \n\ni've had the following: \n- the ultimate <mark>Grilled Cheese</mark>\n- the <mark>Tuna Melt</mark> with swiss (i request for them to add lettuce and tomato... no extra charge!)\n- <mark>The Earl's Club</mark> with turkey and bacon\n- <mark>The Full Montagu </mark> - roast beef and turkey\n- the <mark>Breakfast BLT</mark> (i request to add egg on mine... no extra charge!)\n- the caprese - they definitely don't skimp on the mozzarrella!  \n- the blt \n- the tomato soup\n\neverything.  and i mean everything above is delicious.  however, the <mark>Tuna Melt</mark> is my all time favorite.  $5.99 for a regular sandwich and $3.99 for a breakfast one... can't get a better quality meal for that price on the strip!  \n\nwish i ordered an extra one yesterday to have today while i drool and write this review...", 
            "there are literally thousands of reviews extolling earl of sandwich as the finest (and most affordable!) place to have a sandwich on the strip.\n\nwhile all those reviews are indeed awesome, i'm going to talk about something else entirely: tomato soup.\n\nyes, tomato soup.\n\n(i've said it before and i'll say it again... the easiest way to make a snap judgement about a restaurant is by looking at the quality of its soup.)\n\nthe tomato soup at earl's is orgasmic.  in fact, it's the best damn tomato soup i've ever had.  it's rich, it's creamy, and it's packed with an incredible depth of tomato flavor.  it's topped with the most perfectly crisped croutons i've ever encountered (not too soft, not too hard).  one spoonful of this tomato soup and i was in foodie heaven ...\n\n... at 8:30am.\n\nyeah, i went to earl's for breakfast.  weird, i know -- but please don't hate.  it's actually a great place to go for breakfast.  there are no lines in the morning, and there's plenty of seating to go around.  in fact, it was only like 5 minutes between when i placed my order at the counter and when the little electronic plastic thingy started blinking and vibrating to let me know my food was ready.\n\nwhat to have with tomato soup at 8:30am?  <mark>Grilled Cheese</mark> wasn't on the menu, so i had the next-best thing: the <mark>Tuna Melt</mark>.  and, oh my god, this <mark>Tuna Melt</mark> was just as orgasmic as the tomato soup.  it was a fresh, delicious roll with piping hot tuna and a layer of beautifully melted cheese.  is there such thing as tuna bliss?  i think there is, and it's served up at earl's.\n\ndid i mention that all this food cost less than 10 bucks?\n\nhave i convinced you of earl's amazingness yet?  if so, get off your butt and walk -- no, run -- to the planet hollywood hotel as fast as you possibly can and start noshing on some of the best cheap eats in las vegas.", 
            "this is a great spot to hit within planet hollywood for a quick lunch, particularly if you're looking for something decent to eat at a very inexpensive price. this place is always busy because everyone knows you'll get a decent bite of food at a great price. they were nice enough to let me get a kid's <mark>Grilled Cheese</mark> the last time i was there, because i was in the mood for a <mark>Grilled Cheese</mark> (they don't have an adult version on the menu). soups are good as well. staff is friendly and somehow they move through the long line quickly! \n\nit's probably also a good place if you're a big gambler and want to take a quick break or for a late nite snack!", 
            "what better way to end a night of fist pumping and drinking than with a solid meal? a kids meal that is. \n\ni opted for the <mark>Grilled Cheese</mark> sandwich and <mark>Tomato</mark> soup. the guy at the register tried to talk me out of the soup and i am so glad i didn't let him, it was my favorite part! absolutely amazing, especially when dipping the griled cheese into it: yum. \n\ngo here. don't think twice.", 
            "it definitely deserves the high rating it receives. we got 4 sandwiches. the <mark>Tuna Melt</mark> was superb.i think i am going to eat that again tomorrow. the other people in the group got the carribean jerk sandwich, veggie and <mark>Grilled Cheese</mark>. everything other than the <mark>Grilled Cheese</mark> was amazing.", 
            "wtf.... i can't believe this place gets nearly 5 star reviews!!! had their signature sandwich, tomato soup, kid's <mark>Grilled Cheese</mark>, chinese chicken salad, <mark>Potato Salad</mark> and the miniature brownies.  picked up 2 bottles of beer.  all of this came out to $46?  i don't mind paying for what you get, but this was getting subway shit.  the sandwich was ok, nothing that great.  the tomato soup was pretty damn close to what comes out of a campbell's can with yesterday's bread as croutons.  the kid's <mark>Grilled Cheese</mark> looked like a overcooked whole wheat hamburger bun and it was dry.  salad was good, totally dug how they put the dressing at the bottom to control the withering.  <mark>Potato Salad</mark> was pretty generic and tasted like it was out of a tub.  brownies were overbaked and crunchy (if you're into that sort of thing).  seriously people, check out a specialties sandwich or a corner bakery sandwich.  if you thought this place deserved 5 stars, you'll make either of those places, your last meal on earth.", 
            "oh earl's, i finally get to try you! my friends and i roll into vegas around 1:45pm and check into vdara. we're starving from our drive from l.a. and head over to earl's. two of us got the <mark>Chipotle <mark>Chicken Bacon Avocado</mark></mark> (cca) and our other friend ordered the <mark>Grilled Cheese</mark> from the kid's menu (she has the tiniest appetite in the world). the cca was pretty delicious! it comes with bacon, which i'm not a huge fan of, but it provided a nice kick of salt. not spicy enough for my liking, but the bread is so good omg. perfectly toasted with a nice crunch, but not too hard or chewy! my friend also really liked her <mark>Grilled Cheese</mark>. its tiny, served on a small round bun with two kinds of cheeses.\n\nthis location is speedy, you order and get a buzzer and they buzz you when it's ready to be picked up. seating is a free for all, but we didn't have any problems finding a table.", 
            "i don't get what the hype is about this place don't get me wrong my sandwich was good, but it was just that. it was nothing special and i would not come back here or recommend it to anyone. i tried <mark>The Full Montagu </mark> and it was alright. i stole a few bites from the <mark>Tuna Melt</mark> (decent) and <mark>The Original 1762 </mark> (pretty good) but the only lasting impression is their mustard spread and horseradish sauce. the tomato soup tastes like it was warmed up from a can. also, my sister was in the mood for something simple and got the <mark>Grilled Cheese</mark>, it was like a roll of bread and the tiniest amount of cheese. way too much bread. the mac and cheese is good even though the way it's packaged reminded me of airline food which made me not want to try it but i'm glad i did as that was one of the best things i ate there.", 
            "i think this place is a bit overrated. i don't agree they make \"the world's greatest hot sandwiches\" that's a pretty big claim. you don't get to select the type of bread or customize your sandwich like most sandwich shops do so you're stuck with what you ordered. my son didn't like his non \"<mark>Grilled Cheese</mark>\" sandwich which looked more like a warm muffin with cheese in it and a bit dry i might add. my ham and cheese sandwich was ok didn't blow me away -- average at best. prices i like but not the long wait, not enough tables and chairs to accommodate the crowd is what really killed it for me. we literally waited 45 minutes for our order while trying to find seating for four. we ended up spending more than an hour at this \"slow food\" joint. would i come back next time? probably but avoid lunch and dinner times at all cost unless you like slow service and the crowd.", 
            "never ever ever ever ever ever get the <mark>Grilled Cheese</mark> !!!! it's seriously just a cheese burger without the hamburger patty. literally it's two buns - one side is buttered and one side has cheese ... you call that a <mark>Grilled Cheese</mark> ?! wish they would've advice my munchy buzzed self not  to purchase it."

            "i am a regular to vegas and the vegas food scene, which is comprised mainly of: expensive gourmet dining ($120 and up for 2 range), or overpriced mediocre dining (chain restaurants such as outback, whose prices are inflated because of its \"on the strip\" location, and rainforest cafe) and cheap fast food joints (prices still inflated from what they'd normally charge if not on the strip.. the panda express, mc'dees, rubios, s'barro pizza). \n\non my last trip to vegas, i decided that i wouldn't be a sucker anymore. i wanted to have a good meal, at a reasonable price, and if i have to walk half the strip, then so be it. i searched on yelp and earl of sandwich came up. a deja-vu moment came back, since i've been to planet hollywood before and recalled having briefly seen this spot, not far after you enter the hotel/ casino. i trekked my way from mgm to ph, for this. worth the 82 degrees heat, and the 15 min walk. and alas, i can't place earl in any of the 3 categories of the vegas dining scene. i guess i am mentally creating a new category: good & cheap! (i believe earl's is a chain, but it's too good to be put in the same league as the other chain restaurants). \n\nit was just the 2 of us, but since i wanted to give a fair review of the food, we got 3 sandwiches for variety: <mark>The Full Montagu </mark>, the <mark><mark>Ham <mark>Turkey 'N' Swiss</mark></mark></mark> and the <mark>All American</mark>. <mark>The Full Montagu </mark> is my favorite, with just the right amount of meat (roast beef and turkey), 2 types of cheese (swiss and sharp cheddar) and a good slab of the house mustard sauce.the <mark>All American</mark> is like thanksgiving on a sandwich (it has cranberries, turkey, cheese). the ham and swiss is the most boring choice of the 3, but it's good quality ham n' cheese sandwich. \n\nyou do have to get chips or any other sides for additional cost, as they aren't included in the $5.95 price (for all sandwiches!). they get packed. but other than that, it's a solid spot.",

            "i stumbled here because my friends were attracted to the price. yelp raved about it, so it couldn't hurt to check out something different, right? \n\nthe \"earl of sandwich\" is located inside the planet hollywood mall. when we arrived, a long line snaked outside into the mall, making it look quite promising. i would say the decor gave me the impression of an upscale quiznos + starbucks combined.\n\nanyhow, the large display of <mark>The Full Montagu </mark> got my attention - a \"large\", mouthwatering sandwiched loaded with meat. even the description made it sound appetizing - fresh roasted beef, turkey, aged swiss and sharp cheddar cheese with lettuce, roma <mark>Tomato</mark>, and mustard sauce stuffed into their artisan loaf. on the contrary, all their sandwiches came in the form of a 6\"x3\" brick-wrapped foil - totally misleading. after unwrapping it, it appeared as though they took a full sandwich and compacted into this square block, more filling than expected  because i could not finish it. anyhow, this combination of ingredients ended up tasting rather plain. the bread probably had the most flavor.\n\ntheir tomato soup with housemade croutons is pleasant and not too shabby. the <mark>Potato Salad</mark> looked delicous, but ended up being a bit too salty. their lemonade ice tea reminded me of sonic's - watered down with not enough lemon flavoring.\n\nanyhow, to sum up the \"earl of sandwich\", they present themselves well, but in actuality, they're just another mid-ranged chain with mid-ranged chain quality food.", 
            "i have heard so many friends rave about earls that i feel like i've been here a thousand times.  finally i can put an end to all the \"you've got to try earl's\" and \"you've never been to earl's?\" and \"dude, earl's is amazing\" because i ate at earl's!!!  is everyone quite satisfied now?\n\nthis earl's is in the planet hollywood casino which attributes to its popularity and long lines.  i don't think there is anywhere on the strip you could find a more affordable meal unless you are completely desperate and stumble towards a fast food chain like mcdonald's or subway.  speaking of subway, earl's is nothing like subway or quiznos for that matter.  i was somewhat expecting earl's to be like these two popular chains but fortunately, earl's was a few hundred notches up on the sandwich ladder.  earl has a extremely efficient ordering and sandwich production line.  i promplty received my order within a couple minutes of payment, mind you, there was quite the crowd so the speed of execution was quite impressive and would make any vp of operations proud.\n\nwhen a place is so hyped up i'm usually faced with bitter disappointment but i'm happy to say that this time, with earl's, i wasn't disappointed.  mind you, it wasn't a life altering experience and harps and giggling angels didn't fill my head after the first bite but overall, it was one of my best sandwich experiences.\n\nbecause of all the hype, i took it upon myself to try as many sandwiches during my visit as possible so i promptly ordered <mark>The Original 1762 </mark> roast beef, <mark>The Earl's Club</mark>, the italian and the jerk chicken along with a brownie, a blue moon beer and a coke.  before you start pondering what a complete pig i am, i shared these with my group of 4 so everyone got a 1/4 sandwich each.  this was a great way to try a wide selection of their sandwiches, a prix fix earl's sampling if you would.\n\non to the actual sandwiches. \n\n<mark>The Original 1762 </mark> was superb.  the roast beef was juicy and flavorful, the horshradish was spicy and blended perfectly with the beef and sharp cheddar cheese.  it was light years ahead of the roast beef sandwich i had at quiznos just a few weeks before. <mark>The Earl's Club</mark> was also very delightful with turkey and ham with fresh lettece and <mark>Tomato</mark>.  the italian wasn't my favorite with its pastrami and ham combination but everyone else in my group thought it was terrific, i guess i'm not a big fan of pastrami.  for me, the star of the show was the jerk chicken.  the chicken was moist and the jerk sauce added a spicy kick to this exceptional sandwich.  the thing that made all these sandwiches special was the bread.  only one kind of bread is served at earl's and its their artisan white perfectly toasted.  if you believe that bread is what makes a great sandwich then earl's should be your sandwich mecca because you would be extremely hard pressed to find another worthy opponent.\n\nhmmmm, i seem to have written too much....i doubt any of you will actually read to this point but for those that make it this far, thanks, i'm relieved my rambling was entertaining enough to retain your attention for this long.  i guess i'll just summerize earl's in one last line.  if you haven't tried earl of sandwich, you should listen to all these 5 star yelp reviews and take the plunge, you'll most likely become another raver like myself.",

            "on my last trip to vegas, one afternoon i woke up to discover that three different groups of people i went there to meet had independently decided to go to earl of sandwich.  although i had never heard of this place before, it was clear that i had to try it, and i am definitely glad that i did.\n\nthe first thing that stands out about earl of sandwich is the price.  when you are used to paying $8-10 for a sandwich in dc, $6 for a sandwich is fantastic.  and when that $6 sandwich tastes better than any that you're used to, it's mind-blowing to say the least.\n\ni tried <mark>The Original 1762 </mark> 1762, a roast beef sandwich with cheddar cheese and horseradish sauce.  i also had a taste of <mark>The Full Montagu </mark>, which has roast beef, turkey, swiss, cheddar, lettuce, <mark>Tomato</mark> and mustard.  first off, the bread is outstanding.  it's toasted and has a great crunch to it, without being overly thick.  the meats are also great and the sandwiches have a good amount on them.  although the sandwiches are a bit on the small side, they are ok for a smaller meal, especially when paired with chips or soup (which i did not personally try, but have heard good things about).\n\noverall it's a great place to go and i highly recommend it.  that sandwich was one of the best i've ever had and i wish i had had time to try more of their menu.  whether it's a late night snack or lunch, earl of sandwich is definitely worth checking out.",

            "after seeing so many people review them on yelp, i was stoked to finally check out earl of sandwich.  from the way people hand them five stars and how they've earned about 1,800 reviews, it's like they're sandwich royalty!\n\nwhen a couple of my friends and i stopped by to grab a quick dinner before meeting with everyone else, we fully expected to run into a line.  given their popularity, we figured it wouldn't be a question of \"if\" there would be a wait, but \"how long\", especially since we were going around 7:00.  much to our surprise, there wasn't a single person ahead of us when we got there.  score!  \n\nsince my friend and i both wanted to try a couple of their sandwiches, we decided to get two different types to share.  while she ordered <mark>The Original 1762 </mark> 1762 (roast beef, sharp cheddar, and horseradish sauce), i ordered the italian (salami, capicola, roasted ham, mortadella, mozzarella, roma <mark>Tomato</mark>, and italian dressing).  even though i tried to set aside any expectations i had, it was tough trying to block out the reviews i read.  while the sandwiches were decent, they fell a little short for me.  with all the hype though, it was bound to happen.\n\n- <mark>The Original 1762 </mark> 1762 (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/dkys3arloha8si5uuemhow?select=rejjpoepwak0flvh-bkn0g) - it's essentially a roast beef sandwich, but its simplicity worked.  the roast beef and sharp cheddar were nice, but it was the horseradish sauce that did it for me - potent enough for a kick, but not enough to be harsh.  i wish the meat had been a little more medium rare than medium though.  \n- italian (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/dkys3arloha8si5uuemhow?select=k8po4fzjs9cgjcysodhfrw) - okay, but i think the hot italian at jj boulangerie at the paris hotel is better (and bigger).  i liked the blend of flavors from the meat, but it was hard to separate them out.  the roma <mark>Tomato</mark> added some freshness, but i could have used less of them.  ditto for the italian dressing.\n\nregardless of anything else, earl is an especially budget friendly option given its location on the strip (sandwiches were about $7.00 each).  plus points as well for being open 24 hours - way better for late night munchies than the 24 cafe at paris or the bar at bally's.  for those reasons, i'm rounding up from three and a half to four.  had we actually gone then (drunk) instead of for dinner (sober), i probably would have loved earl of sandwich.  instead, depending on the sandwich i want, i might lean towards jj boulangerie instead and save my earl trips for post drinking/clubbing adventures.",

            "love love love this place! it is only fitting that a sandwich the menu be named after <mark>The Full Montagu </mark> legacy.  john montagu, 4th earl of sandwich, apparently loved to gamble (nice we have a couple locations then huh?) and after playing 24 hours straight, he asked the cook to make him something easy to hold in one hand and eat and the other hand could be free to play cards. he was brought 2 pieces of bread with meat in between it. this is the story i got from the restaurant, seems maybe the cook actually invented it?! i first went to earl of sandwich in california at downtown disney and really enjoyed it so i was happy when we got an eos! \n\ni can't believe it is only about $6 per sandwich! it tastes so fresh and yummy. i can easily eat just one and be full but my hubby does need 2 to get full. i like the \"<mark>The Full Montagu </mark>\" which has  freshly roasted beef, turkey, aged swiss & sharp cheddar, lettuce, roma <mark>Tomato</mark> & the earl's mustard sauce. i have them hold the lettuce (just my personal preference).\n\nif you are not a meat eater they have a couple sandwiches for you called the \"veggie\" and \"caprese\" and a variety of soups. i like the \"wisconsin cheddar\" for the soup it is really tasty.\n\nthe next thing i am going to try is one of their wraps. i do want to mention the line is sometimes very long but i promise you that it moves very quickly. you can even bring your own soda or stop at a gas station and get something if you wanted to save a bit and not pay for one of theirs.",

            "another popular and raved about sandwich joint i've heard so much about. and after seeing my gf's always post pictures of their sandwiches i had to try it out. but couldn't soak up the whole experience since i had a protein bar an hour before and was trying to avoid eating heavy since were going to go clubbing afterwards. yes a very girly thing but hey, got to fit in my dress! just tried a few bites here and there. went both friday and saturday and wanted to go back again. something about the packaging reminded me of willy wonka's golden ticket that are hidden in the chocolate hahah. can never get enough. please come to la earl!\n\n_<mark>The Original 1762 </mark>, roasted beef, cheddar and horseradish sauce was pretty good. i loved the horseradish sauce! it really made the sandwich stand out. although a little too much meat for me. \n_<mark>The Full Montagu </mark>, roasted beef, turkey, swiss, cheddar, lettuce, tomato, and mustard sauce was one big juicy bite. although it seemed a little too cheesy. i think either swiss or cheddar would be good but having both was a bit too rich for me. but i'm sure most like a whole lot of cheese. luckily the small amout of lettuce and tomato helped a bit.\n_<mark>Chipotle <mark>Chicken Bacon Avocado</mark></mark>, grilled chicken, <mark>Bacon, Egg <mark>Ham 'N' Cheddar</mark></mark>, avocado, lettuce and chipotle sauce was my favorite. the chipotle sauce was great and not too overdrenched. every bite was better and just melts in your mouth. \n_baja chicken salad, romaine, grilled chicken, cheddar, cilantro, avocado, <mark>Tomato</mark>, roasted corn, black beans, tortilla strips, and red wine vinaigrette was refreshing. the salad was a bit small of a portion but not bad. nothing amazing. but good to share with a friend and half a sandwich. \n\ni would definitely come back and this time make sure not to eat any protein bars beforehand haha. and wear a more loose dress. can't wait to go back and try the other sandwiches!",

            "3.5 stars\n\nthe sandwiches aren't worthy of the overall 4.5-star rating here on yelp but they are good enough .... as snacks!  the sandwiches are small and there's hardly any meat in them to the point where you might wish you had more... or perhaps ordered two for yourself.  \n\nwe got:\n\npastrami reuben - i really liked this as the flavor was definitely there but was disappointed when there was hardly any pastrami in my sandwich.  if i were to come back, i'd get this one again, though, since i'm a fan of pastrami.\n\n<mark>The Full Montagu </mark> - this had roasted beef, turkey, swiss, cheddar cheese, lettuce and <mark>Tomato</mark>.  this wasn't bad but it definitely had more meat than the other sandwich.  again, the sandwich was the same size as the other -- small! \n\nthis place is convenient if you are either staying around the strip but i'd rather drive and explore what else vegas has to offer.  i'm sure they have better sandwiches that have generous portions of meat for about the same price.  as good as the pastrami reuban was (minus the lack of pastrami), i'm most likely to pass these sandwiches up and drive to some place else.  worth a try, though!",

            "no vegas trip is complete without earl's, especially when it's 4/5am in the morning and you have the drunchies. so whenever you're in town, make sure you hit up ph and grab one of their hot sandwiches.\n\nthe only sandwich i ever gotten was the italian, salami, pastrami, <mark>Tomato</mark> and such. for 7 bucks, it's a great sandwich, especially after a long night of drinking. being open 24/7 is definitely a smart business move because not a lot of things are open during those hours in vegas. \n\ni usually always plan to stay around ph just for earl's because let's face it, we all have to each to survive in vegas. i've never been disappointed with my sandwich, and i always get multiples. be aware that the lines could be line sometimes, and i mean long.. especially during rush hours. my advice is to call in and order, go down and pay, the wait will be less.", 
            "i think the biggest draw to this place is how inexpensive it is. i say inexpensive as opposed to cheap, since it doesn't taste cheap. most or all sandwiches were $6.99 which is really reasonable for vegas. \ni got the italian, and my girlfriend got the chipotle chicken so we each had half. i liked the italian much better; the <mark>Tomato</mark> tasted fresh and were a good addition. that said, if you're not into cured meats, the chipotle chicken was good and had a nice spice to it. \n\noverall, this a good one to hit for a quick, relatively small lunch and to stay on the less expensive side.", 
            "this place hits the spot.  \n\ni really enjoy the <mark>Holiday Turkey</mark> sandwich. it's like thanksgiving in a sandwich, literally. haha.  it's my to-go most of the time probably because it's so strange and unique, but it just works! drenching the sandwich with some of that dijon mustard (okay, maybe not too much of it) they have on the table gives it a nice kick too.  i've tried the other sandwiches, but this one is just the most memorable for me. \n\nas for the caprese, there's like almost nothing in it besides like <mark>Tomato</mark> and the cheese that comes with it, and of course some sauce. but i feel like this one is not so worth it. \n\noverall, thumbs up.",

            "bizarre how earl of sandwich is located in the planet hollywood hotel in las vegas, because this place is neither hollywood glamour or vegas sin; it gives more of the down-to-earth home feel.\n\n<mark>The Full Montagu </mark> (roasted beef, turkey, swiss & cheddar cheese, lettuce, roma tomato & earl's mustard) is near sandwich perfection. if you need an extra kick, all the tables are stocked with grey poupon, which i'm a total sucker for. the bf had cannonballs! (meatballs, marinara, mozzarella & parmesan cheese), which was a little salty, but still delish when hot. then again, meatball sandwiches were never my thing.\n\nif like me, you need your sandwich with a side of soup, this place offers a few soups to choose from. i had the broccoli and cheese soup, which comes with oyster crackers if you ask for them. it had nice bite-sized chunks of broccoli and wasn't too thick.\n\nto finish it off, we tried the ice cream sandwich made with ghirardelli chocolate. the top layer of brownie was good, but the ice cream wasn't creamy enough and the bottom layer was cake, which felt kind of cheap.\n\nthe best part about it is that the prices are totally reasonable and comparable to national sandwich chains. the sandwiches are all $5.95 and soups $2.95. and don't think you're going to get cheated with a shot glass of soup. it was an honest bowl-sized portion, and definitely more than what you'd get at the other chains. in addition, it offers a variety of <mark>Fruit Cup</mark>, parfaits, <mark>Potato Salad</mark>, cookies, chips and the like. you can have a full meal for under $10 in vegas. unheard of!",

            "i stumbled here because my friends were attracted to the price. yelp raved about it, so it couldn't hurt to check out something different, right? \n\nthe \"earl of sandwich\" is located inside the planet hollywood mall. when we arrived, a long line snaked outside into the mall, making it look quite promising. i would say the decor gave me the impression of an upscale quiznos + starbucks combined.\n\nanyhow, the large display of <mark>The Full Montagu </mark> got my attention - a \"large\", mouthwatering sandwiched loaded with meat. even the description made it sound appetizing - fresh roasted beef, turkey, aged swiss and sharp cheddar cheese with lettuce, roma <mark>Tomato</mark>, and mustard sauce stuffed into their artisan loaf. on the contrary, all their sandwiches came in the form of a 6\"x3\" brick-wrapped foil - totally misleading. after unwrapping it, it appeared as though they took a full sandwich and compacted into this square block, more filling than expected  because i could not finish it. anyhow, this combination of ingredients ended up tasting rather plain. the bread probably had the most flavor.\n\ntheir tomato soup with housemade croutons is pleasant and not too shabby. the <mark>Potato Salad</mark> looked delicous, but ended up being a bit too salty. their lemonade ice tea reminded me of sonic's - watered down with not enough lemon flavoring.\n\nanyhow, to sum up the \"earl of sandwich\", they present themselves well, but in actuality, they're just another mid-ranged chain with mid-ranged chain quality food.",

            "my favorite place to eat when i go to vegas!  not only is it one of the cheaper options on the strip, but it's open late and it's delicious.  planet hollywood is smart, because this is one of the only reasons i make a trip over (i guess also, because planet hollywood is the only place i'm ever up in blackjack, but that's besides the point).  my go-to sandwich is always the caprese sandwich, and i add turkey to it (still gotta have my meat!).  it is less than $10 i believe (i think it's like - $6 for the sandwich alone, and like $2-3 for the added meat) but man, the bread is delicious, the balsamic is awesome, and i have a soft spot in my heart for fresh mozzarrella.  love. also, their <mark>Potato Salad</mark> is pretty tasty too, but small portions, so beware if you want to share, because you might just end up with about 2 bites.  i want to go back to vegas now just thinking about the deliciousness that is earl of sandwich, mmmmmmmm....",

            "awesome hot sandwich place :) \n\ndecent prices, quick service, and good tasting food.\n\ni even liked their packaged foods like their <mark>Potato Salad</mark> and macaroni salad. i have also tried their <mark><mark>Chicken Caesar</mark></mark> salad which is just as good as the sandwiches",

[in one day] to have a light dinner after swimming at the planet hollywood hotel.   the menu is big.. with lots to offer.  things may seem ordinary, but trust me.. the bread makes all the difference.  they have a soup menu, a hot sandwich menu, wraps and salads... and of course desserts!  \n\nyou order your sandwich, wrap or salad.. they give you a buzzer and a receipt... you walk down the line of neatly arranged extras of <mark>Potato Salad</mark>, macaroni salads... <mark>Fruit Cup</mark>, brownies, chips... ice cream sandwiches!  it's pretty overwhelming ... in a good way!!\n\ni had <mark>The Full Montagu </mark>: freshly roasted beef, turkey, aged swiss & sharp cheddar cheese, lettuce, roma <mark>Tomato</mark> & the earl's mustard sauce...  the roast beef is fresh, the consistency is perfect.. the bread is amazing.   i also had the broccoli cheddar soup and it's seriously one of the best broc cheddar's i've ever had.  michelle e.  also bough a cup of <mark>Brownie Bites</mark> that topped off my meal... i didn't even have to visit sugars after wards.  :p\n\nthis sandwich shop definitely makes the top 5 list of sandwich shops i've ever been too.. you'll be seeing me again earl of sandwich.. i promise!",

            "decided to head down to the strip and deal with the crowds. luckily it wasn't too crazy and the line moved pretty quickly. the wife and i decided to order 3 sandwiches to share. all 3 were really great sandwiches...the bread is amazing and i thought they portioned everything just right. it's not hard to eat a sandwich and a half but for food on the strip, the pricing is on point. \n\n<mark>The Full Montagu </mark> - i believe this is one of their staple sandwiches and that's for good reason. the turkey and roast beef are both tender and on their own, have great flavor. this sandwich came out with the perfect temp and both cheeses (aged swiss/sharp cheddar) were melted perfectly. they also add a killer mustard sauce which just made it even better.\n\n<mark>Chipotle <mark>Chicken Bacon Avocado</mark></mark> - my wife's favorite of the 3. large chunks of juicy chicken, a good amount of bacon and compared to most other sandwich joints, huge pieces of avocado. the chipotle sauce had great flavor and didn't overpower the sandwich which i really liked.\n\nthe italian - this was our least favorite of the 3 but still a good sandwich. the flavor was great but they put way too much italian dressing on it. my favorite part was the cheese, i am a cheese lover and they put huge slices of fresh mozzarella on here...amazing!\n\nthe bread was exactly the same on all 3 and it's definitely up their in the top for sandwich joints. it tastes fresh baked and it has perfect texture. it's a bit like ciabatta but without the crisp outside. chewy all the way through, taste good and super soft. just excellent bread!\n\nwe also had some sides...<mark>Potato Salad</mark> and a <mark>Fruit Cup</mark>. the <mark>Potato Salad</mark> was ok and the fruit was fresh but neither stood out except for the prices. they give you very small prepackaged cups of the sides and they cost $2.49 each. i wish i had tried the mac n cheese that everyone seems to rave about.\n\nwas this the best sandwich i ever ate? no...but they were definitely on the top and deserve every bit of the thousands of positive reviews they get. they do have quite a small seating area and i'm usually not big on going down to the strip just to eat, but i wouldn't hesitate going back for more. in my opinion, ph has some of the best spots for food on the strip and earl's is one of them.", 
            "totally a fan of this place. it's also slightly better than the earl of sandwhich at the downtown disney location in anaheim for some reason. i've eaten at both locations several time already now. the only thing that bugs me about this place is the line. the line is pretty long and it can take awhile for you to get your order. and the last time i went here, they ran out of <mark>Potato Salad</mark>, which is my absolute favorite side here!! i was totally bummed out about that. regardless, i still highly recommend this place.",

            "i'm so sad. earl of sandwich has definitely downgraded from the glory it used to be!\n\ni came here on my last trip to vegas, only to find out that earl is now only a shadow of his former self. \n\nlet me interject with some background history: i frequented vegas when i lived in southern california. when i say frequent, i mean at least once a month. i know vegas like the back of my hand: i can tell you what hotels are located where, and what time each of the nightclubs' guestlists close. i was very familiar with earl's menu. drunkenly slurring out an order for the <mark>Earl's Cobb</mark> wrap, debating over the <mark>Potato Salad</mark> in the fridge, with my heels in hand at 4 am in the morning - that was my thing!\n\nso on my most recent trip, i happily approached the cashier at earl's, announcing that i would like to order the earl cobb wrap. this was what i had been looking forward to all night, post-clubbing. not squeezing myself into a dress, not enjoying the live dj performing at a million or billion dollar club or whatever, but shoving earl's in my face drunkenly after a night of dancing. \n\nthen the cashier said the words that absolutely broke my heart: \"we don't have the earl cobb wrap\".\n\ni stared agape at him. the wrap that i had eaten loyally for 4 years straight on my every trip was gone?! just like that?! \n\ni spent a while in disbelief, drunkenly lamenting my sadness to mr.cashier before reluctantly ordering a chinese chicken wrap and making my way down the queue. \n\nwalking through the line, i brightened up at the thought of at least getting my <mark>Potato Salad</mark>. i peered into the refridgerator. and my spirits plummetted once again. what was once a generous portion of <mark>Potato Salad</mark> (think 6 oz) was now 2-3 oz! the same applied for the yogurt parfait - it was half the size it used to be! and surprise surprise, the prices were still the same original prices.\n\nby the time i get to the front cashier (where customers pay), i was one sad, drunken lady. i shook the <mark>Potato Salad</mark> in mr. 2nd cashier,'s face, demanding \"why! why did you make this smaller? what happened!!\"\n\nmr. 2nd cashier responded tonelessly (he was probably used to these reactions), \"corporate happened.\"\n\nwhen i received my wrap, instead of the wheat pita bread earl's wraps used to use, it was some stupid flour tortilla. dry and definitely did not soften the loss of my beloved earl cobb wrap. bleh.\n\nand so, i shake my fist as i angrilly write this review. darn you, corporate, darn you! how dare you take away what was once magical about earl of sandwich!", 
            "this place is seriously out of this world. i went based on the really high ratings, and now i know why it got so many. \n\nmy husband and i ordered the chicken jerky and <mark>The Full Montagu </mark> sandwiches. also, we got the coleslaw and <mark>Potato Salad</mark>. all items were so so good! i personally loved the chicken jerky more, but my husband loved <mark>The Full Montagu </mark> better. either way, you can't go wrong here. \n\nnext time i'm in vegas i'll definitely be stopping by. prices are super reasonable as well! win win. :)",

            "\"serf of sandwich\" is more like it.\n\nthere doesn't seem to be any \"earl\" like qualities about this place or the food for that matter.  the title of earl is reserved for the aristocratic english nobility, and so it would seem that the sandwiches/products may or would exhibit some kind of high quality.  \nyes, it's cheap but it just seems ordinary to me.  in fact, my entire dining experience was not very memorable at all.  it all seemed like a bad dream and i couldn't wait to wake up so to speak.\n\nlocation:  miracle mile shops at planet hollywood hotel and casino.\n\nthere is one line that forms for the ordering counter.  menus are displayed above the ordering station/kitchen or near the waiting area for the line.  various cold, hot and breakfast sandwiches available.  admittedly, there are a wide variety of choices on their menu.  sides and sodas (self serve) available as well.\n\nafter looking over their menu i finally decided on the pastrami reuben.  i honestly can't remember the sandwiches my two friends had since no one took pics or seemed satisfied with their food.  we all shared sides of chips, and potato and <mark>Pasta Salad</mark>.\n\nfood:  \njust ok really.  my sandwich was just alright.  priced at $6.49 i thought it would have been bigger and better (i'm really wishing i took a picture right now).  i think the three of us finished most of our food because we were hungry having decided to forgot breakfast that morning.  in any case, the food was somewhat acceptable.  the sides were just ok as well.\n\nservice:  \nnot great.  and here's a tip:  you don't pay for your meal when you order your food.  the staff will take your sandwich order at the first counter and provide a pager to indicate when your food is ready.  we arrived at 1030am and the line was already building with the lunch crowd.  there was only one staff ringing up customer at the pay counter and it seemed that the other staff didn't care or want to help the poor guy out.  my friends and i waited what seemed like an eternity to pay for our food.  \n\nside note:  you can pick up sides, i.e. <mark>Potato Salad</mark> and chips, along the counter space between the order and pay stations.  \n\nwhy?:  why aren't there more seats or a larger seating area since this place seems to so popular??  \n\nbottom line:  i'm honestly not too sure why this place is so popular.  i thought it was alright.  there really should be a larger seating area for customers.",

            "when i stayed at planet hollywood a few weeks ago, i often dined here. their sandwiches are the best i have ever had. you can tell how popular it is by the long, long lines that this place has. you can see the employees make your sandwiches are they give you a buzzer to let you know when your order is ready to be picked up at the counter. \n\ni've tried <mark>The Earl's Club</mark>, <mark>Chipotle <mark>Chicken Bacon Avocado</mark></mark>, and the <mark>Chicken Bacon Avocado</mark> wrap. my favorite is <mark>The Earl's Club</mark> (it's displayed on the huge board above the area where you place your order). they have salads, wraps, soups, side items (<mark>Pasta Salad</mark>, <mark>Potato Salad</mark>, chips, etc), and hot and cold sandwiches. i'd say stick with the hot sandwiches because you won't be able to get sandwiches like these. they wrapped them up in a paper foil that keeps it hot and warm for a long time. the sandwiches are so big that i always have to save the other half for later. \n\nwhat's another great perk about this place? there's free wifi!\n\ni can't wait to come back to las vegas. i will definitely frequent it whenever i'm in town.",

            "\"serf of sandwich\" is more like it.\n\nthere doesn't seem to be any \"earl\" like qualities about this place or the food for that matter.  the title of earl is reserved for the aristocratic english nobility, and so it would seem that the sandwiches/products may or would exhibit some kind of high quality.  \nyes, it's cheap but it just seems ordinary to me.  in fact, my entire dining experience was not very memorable at all.  it all seemed like a bad dream and i couldn't wait to wake up so to speak.\n\nlocation:  miracle mile shops at planet hollywood hotel and casino.\n\nthere is one line that forms for the ordering counter.  menus are displayed above the ordering station/kitchen or near the waiting area for the line.  various cold, hot and breakfast sandwiches available.  admittedly, there are a wide variety of choices on their menu.  sides and sodas (self serve) available as well.\n\nafter looking over their menu i finally decided on the pastrami reuben.  i honestly can't remember the sandwiches my two friends had since no one took pics or seemed satisfied with their food.  we all shared sides of chips, and potato and <mark>Pasta Salad</mark>.\n\nfood:  \njust ok really.  my sandwich was just alright.  priced at $6.49 i thought it would have been bigger and better (i'm really wishing i took a picture right now).  i think the three of us finished most of our food because we were hungry having decided to forgot breakfast that morning.  in any case, the food was somewhat acceptable.  the sides were just ok as well.\n\nservice:  \nnot great.  and here's a tip:  you don't pay for your meal when you order your food.  the staff will take your sandwich order at the first counter and provide a pager to indicate when your food is ready.  we arrived at 1030am and the line was already building with the lunch crowd.  there was only one staff ringing up customer at the pay counter and it seemed that the other staff didn't care or want to help the poor guy out.  my friends and i waited what seemed like an eternity to pay for our food.  \n\nside note:  you can pick up sides, i.e. <mark>Potato Salad</mark> and chips, along the counter space between the order and pay stations.  \n\nwhy?:  why aren't there more seats or a larger seating area since this place seems to so popular??  \n\nbottom line:  i'm honestly not too sure why this place is so popular.  i thought it was alright.  there really should be a larger seating area for customers.",

            "wow.\n\ntaking the recommendations from other yelpers, we ordered <mark>The Full Montagu </mark>, the caprese, a broccoli and cheddar soup, and an ice cream sandwich made with ghiradelli chocolate.\n\neverything was amazing. the roast beef was moist and complemented the turkey in <mark>The Full Montagu </mark>. the bread was nicely toasted, giving a nice satisfying crunch. the caprese had a balsamic dressing that tied the sandwich together in such beautiful harmony. next time i'll ask for the to warm or melt the cheese a bit more; i like my cheese gooey.\n\nthe broccoli and cheddar soup was like broccoli chunks in cheese soup, but somehow the flavors went well. and of course, how can you go wrong with ghiradelli?\n\namazing!! now i'm curious to see how it would've tasted if they used california sourdough's sourdough bread... *drools*\n~*~\ni couldn't help it. we came back the 3rd time this week and why not? at $6 a sandwich and open 24 hours its probably the cheapest good eats on the strip! here's what we've sampled so far in my preferred order.\n\n1. <mark>The Full Montagu </mark> - just perfect\n2. caprese - would order it extra melty next time\n3. holiday - the gravy, cranberry, and stuffing is like warm thanksgiving in my mouth\n4. original 1786 - classic roast beef and horseradish\n5. italian - nice flavors, but didn't jump at me\n\n<mark>Brownie Creme Sandwiches</mark> are like giant brownie oreos. must have.\n\nand if it's hot, the brownie ice cream sandwiches are just as good.\n\nsoups are good too, nice balance, not too salty and good chunky.\n\ndid i mention the <mark>Brownie Creme Sandwiches</mark> have ghiradelli chocolate chips in them? oh yeah....", 
            "amazing sandwiches !!  earl's lived up to it's reputation.  i love their hot sandwiches and how cheap they are ($6.99) especially since it's on the strip (in planet hollywood).  earl's is also 24/7 now, and be sure to try their <mark>Brownie Creme Sandwiches</mark> if you've got a sweet tooth; my boyfriend made us walk to earl's three times for these <mark>Brownie Creme Sandwiches</mark>.  all in all, a must try when you're in vegas."

            "who would've thought that las vegas would be ever known for their sandwiches? well i believe now they are after tasting \"earl of sandwich\" in the planet hollywood hotel and casino. i ordered \"<mark>The Full Montagu </mark>\" and it was a hot roast beef sandwich with turkey, swiss and cheddar cheese, lettuce, and the infamous \"earl's mustard sauce.\" i opted out for the <mark>Tomato</mark> because i feel that <mark>Tomato</mark> can tend to overpower my sandwich with it's juiciness at times...too much juice can make the sandwich loose;) anyhoo, i also tried the \"earl's <mark>Earl Grey Lemonade</mark>\" and it was pretty good, not too sweet. most people might say that the best part of a sandwich is the meat or the sauce, but i believe that it was the \"earl's artisan bread\" that did it for me. it was sturdy enough to hold the meat and toppings in nicely, yet soft enough to keep from getting soggy. so the next time you are in vegas and don't want to do the usual buffet, then get yourself a sandwich at \"earl of sandwich!\"", 
            "i found it pretty strange that everytime i walked by earl of sandwich, it was always half empty, considering how everyone seems to rave about it.\n\ni actually came here early one morning for breakfast because i wasn't hungry for a morning buffet, nor was i in the mood to have eggs or bacon.  i ordered the caribbean jerk chicken sandwich because i remembered how good it looked from the yelp photos.  and it sure was!  for about $6, i thought it was really filling and had a lot a flavor.  i washed it down with earl's <mark>Earl Grey Lemonade</mark>, which was their version of an arnold palmer, and it was good too.  this will most likely be a regular pit stop for me whenever i get hungry on the strip and don't feel like spending much.\n\nbig plus for also being open 24 hours a day.  five stars!!!",

            "i don't really like sandwiches but i love the earl of sandwich sandwiches.\n\nthe first time i was here, it was 3am and i had just flown into las vegas and my <mark>Tuna Melt</mark> was delicious. judging by the long line, many people agreed.\n\nthe second time i was here, it was midday and the place was just as packed. the cashiers were really nice and friendly. once again, i had to order the <mark>Tuna Melt</mark>. i love getting the sandwich and it's so hot it burns your fingers. i know it's definitely fresh. i take a bite; the cheese is so smooth, the bread is soft, and the tuna is delicious. man! i loved the sandwich so much! i was so sad when it was gone. i am definitely coming back.\n\nmy friend also decided to get the <mark>Earl Grey Lemonade</mark>, which was surprisingly really good! i'm going to get that too when i come back to vegas.",

            "this place is so good i ate here twice in a row for lunch out of the 4 days i was in vegas. they offer a large variety of hot sandwiches, salads, some wraps, and baked goods. the price is very reasonable which is great if you're on a budget. for about $8 i could get a nice sandwich and a drink with free refills! the bread is what really makes it for me, nice and warm and a little bit crispy. my bf got the <mark>Hawaiian BBQ</mark> sandwich both times because he said it was so good. i got the meatball sandwich one time and a turkey sandwich with cranberries, lettuce, <mark>Tomato</mark>, and some other things (i can't remember what it's called) which i would highly recommend. just a side note, their earl's <mark>Earl Grey Lemonade</mark> is an arnold palmer. i didn't know that the first time, but it was fine with me since i like them anyway!",

            "finally made it over to see what all of the earl of sandwich hype is all about. my sweetie and i decided on lunch out today and a sandwich is what popped in my head and someplace new!\n\ni ordered the <mark>Hawaiian BBQ</mark>, grilled chicken, roasted ham, aged swiss, pineapple & <mark>Hawaiian BBQ</mark> sauce. it was sweet and good, the meat was moist and juicy. i could have eaten two of these mmmm yum!\n\nmy sweetheart got <mark>The Full Montagu </mark>,  roast beef, turkey,  swiss & sharp cheddar, lettuce, roma <mark>Tomato</mark> & the earl's mustard sauce. we each took a bite of each others sandwich and they are both delicious.\n\nwe also both ordered a side of <mark>Potato Salad</mark>, mmm yum made with the red skin potatoes, was good. \n\nunlimited fountain drinks, coffee and <mark>Iced Tea</mark> as well as <mark>Hot Tea</mark>.\n\nwe will stop by again if at planet hollywood hotel and casino however don't think will make a special trip to dine here like we did today. \n\ni am glad my curiosity has finally been fulfilled :)"

            "i love i love i love!!!!\ni saw this place on jason k's yelp and was intrigued as to how a little sandwich shop could get such great reviews.  i mean, a sandwich is nothing more than bread, meat, <mark>Veggie</mark>, and cheese right? wrong! holy cow. i tried earl of sandwich this past weekend when i was in vegas and it blew me out of the water.  it changed my perspective on what a \"good\" sandwich is forever. \n\ni got <mark>The Full Montagu </mark> sandwich and when i opened the foil wrapper, noticed how warm and toasty the bread was.  when i pulled the two halves apart, i could literally taste the che<mark>Wine</mark> of the bread without taking my first bite.  and oh, the first bite...heavenly.  i dont know how or why it tasted so great but the bread, the fresh <mark>Veggie</mark>, the meats and the mustard (oh the mustard) just started fist pumping and partying in my mouth. \n\ni almost cried when my meal was over. im seriously going to start a petition for someone to open one up out here or good god, give me money so i can do it.", 
            "this was my first meal on my last trip to vegas and it did not disappoint.\n\nboyfriend and i ordered (we weren't too hungry):\n-<mark>The Full Montagu </mark> (about $6): roast beef, turkey, swiss cheese, cheddar cheese, lettuce, roma <mark>Tomato</mark>, mustard.  the sandwich is nice and toasty and there's just the right amount of everything.  \n-chicken soup (about $3): this actually had a lot of tender chicken chunks and soft pasta.  it had a lot of flavor and i thought it was pretty tasty (i was kind of surprised).\n\noverall, earl of sandwich is cheap, quick and tasty.  it's actually very cheap, considering it's prime vegas location.  the bread is probably the best part about the sandwich.  it's fluffy, yet has a good amount of che<mark>Wine</mark> and the toasty-ness of it is perfect.  definitely worth a try.\n\neven if you don't like sandwiches, they have wraps, salads, and some desserts too.\n\nnotes:\n-they have a birthday club.  sign up!\n-line may be long, but it moves quickly."
