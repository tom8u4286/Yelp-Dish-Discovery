            "simply one of the best dinners i have ever had.  first, don't skip the bar... not for the decor, but for the home made cheese straws that are baked each day.  they are friggin great.  the meal began with some shared appetizers; baby <mark>Arugula Salad</mark>, home made salumi plate with proscuitto made by mario's father, and calamari.  all were delicious.  my boss and i split the bone-in ribeye for two which was carved tableside.  this steak was dry aged 6 weeks and cooked to perfection (slightly under medium rare, but not rare).  my only complaint was the lack of values on the wine list.  seriously mario, you place hundreds of italian wines on the menu, and only a handful are under $100 a bottle?  these obscure libations are more respectable when guests can afford more than one bottle.  i ordered a l'adventure from paso robles for $80 which drank well.", 
            "we strolled over to carnevino friday night as soon as we rolled into town, walked right up to the empty bar in the middle of the empty restaurant and had a delicious meal. we shared an <mark>Arugula Salad</mark> (delicious), pappardelle with three mushrooms (toothsomely riveting), and a medium rare bone-in ny strip (fanfarkingtastic),  i dipped my steak into the <mark>Black Truffle Vinaigrette</mark> and dh dipped his into the house steak sauce. it was all noms. so nommingly good, best noms of the weekend. nom nom nom,,  the bartender indulged us to the highest level byletting us taste all kinds of red wine by the glass to go with our food, even opening one bottle especially when he felt it had been open already too long.  i am simply shocked at how quiet it was, because our experience was stellar.", 
            "full review in the blog - only reason for a star off is the paucity of dessert choices at lunch.  at dinner i imagine this place is a solid 5.\n\narriving toward the end of the lunch hour we entered carnevino dressed casually - a tad out of place compared to the all black and white clad service staff.  seated promptly and greeted by josh nearly the moment we were seated the service never faltered throughout our stay - water was refilled rapidly, dishes served impeccably, and bread service...we'll get to that later.  browsing around the large room and high ceilings, dark woods, and white tablecloths covering widely spaced tables the restaurant definitely felt very batali - and the soundtrack of beatles, eagles, the who, and stones coming from the front of the house left no doubt.\n\nmy buddies having already begun their daily drinking at the tables and myself a non drinker we all opted for water - water with ice and multiple refills.  after taking orders and heading to the kitchen we were brought the first of a couple rounds of dinner rolls.  tasting the incredibly complex sweet yet salty and crisp exterior which yielded a pillow-soft interior not unlike a croissant i inquired of our server what exactly constituted these delicious pieces of carbohydrate - lardo, butter, flour, yeast, and \"a bit of parmesan\" i was informed.\n\nallowed to sit and chat for a while before our mains arrived i joked with my buddies about the fact that we had gone to, arguably, the best steak restaurant in vegas and neither had ordered a steak - one opting for the tuna caponata, cocoa agro dolce and the other choosing <mark>The Burger</mark> with pancetta and onion cheddar and <mark>Arugula Salad</mark>.  stating that steak was a \"dinner food' i clearly realized that i needed more epicurean friends.  all joking aside, both of them loved their meal and their dishes looked and smelled excellent  - while my one friend didn't prefer the cocoa accents to his tuna he loved the fish and my other friend stated <mark>The Burger</mark> was the best he'd ever tasted.\nfor myself, the decisions for this meal were based on previous batali experience and both dishes wowed - as expected.  served together since neither of my friends opted for an appetizer the first dish was from the dinner anti-pasti menu and was entitled \"house-cured pastrami\" with local duck egg and emerald butter lettuce.  while i generally don't prefer beef textures, particularly \"lunch meats\" such as pastrami i was told by mr. feit that this dish was more like beef bacon and was made from the dry-aged stock of bbl beef.  trusting his judgement i have to admit this dish was very impressive with the pastrami truly being like a clean and spicy pork bacon in texture - great fattiness and almost melt in the mouth texture despite its somewhat dehydrated nature.  accompanying the pastrami - a single duck egg sunny side up alongside a delicate and dare-i-say \"buttery\" lettuce.  atop the dish was a combination of aged balsamic, olive oil, cracked pepper, and pan juices from the slight pan-kissing of the pastrami.  breaking the yolk of the egg the dish was given a creamy contrast to the other sharp, spicy, and acidic flavors and truly impressed.\n\nthe second dish, also requested from the dinner menu, was entitled sweetbreads \"al boscaiolo\" which according to my server meant \"lumberjack style.\"  served with pan seared mixed/chopped mushrooms, fresh peas, spinach, and a reduction of honey, rosemary, and perhaps sage the sweetbreads were perfectly flash fried to retain their creamy texture and without a bit of brine.  clearly using a bit of salt, pepper, and perhaps cheese in the crispy coating the sweetbreads on their own would have been superb - but pairing their creamy and spicy preparation with the crisp yet mildly sweet greens, woody and smooth mushrooms, and heavily accented honey made the dish a truly one of a kind experience - while not as \"refined\" as guy savoy's preparation the night prior these may have actually been my favorite sweetbread preparation all time - or at least on par with the versions at alex, savoy, and (as much as i dislike admitting it) michael symon's lola.\n\nfinishing up our meals we were told that the dessert menu at lunch was limited to cheeses and ice creams and as such we deferred - too bad since the peach fritters and roasted spiced dates sounded excellent.  settling the tab the meal was actually my cheapest lunch or dinner in vegas yet extremely rewarding.  while i could've certainly done without the eagles (i hate the f&%ckin' eagles man! - lebowski) the service was excellent and accommodating from e-mail all the way to leaving the restaurant and the food was superb.", 
            "how can i tell you about the best burger i had eating so far??? well its a barolo burger serve with a homemade pancetta... you better choose gorgonzola cheese instead of cheddar... serve with a truffle butter and a chianti mustard... choose the <mark>Arugula Salad</mark> for a delicious bitterness taste...  make sure you drink a nice barbaresco or a barolo with it... it can't get better that this... boun provecho!!!", 
            "i wanted to like this place, no....wanted to love this place. read the reviews, booked the resi all based on fellow writer reviews. i hope we just hit it at a bad time, but gut says its just not that good. \n\nwe were the second table seated last wednesday. seated in the giant main area at a table right by the bar. the place has no warmth, its am impressive room but way to big for me and lacking any sustainable character.  as usual with vegas hostess seats us with no menu.  waiter comes with menus, many menus, three to be exact. one big one, one with specials, one with other specials.  asks the typical tap or bottled water question and no drink order. ok, no big deal.   comes back after 15 minutes or so, really? place is not busy yet, its maybe 5:15.  takes our order.  bread comes, its a ciabatta, two spreads, one a rendered pork fat and one butter.  bread is average, fat is always good.   we start with the gnocchi,  strike one.  bland sauce, bland presentation. you sure your italian mario?   next we split the <mark>Arugula Salad</mark>, not bad but nothing to write home about either.  main courses are saltimbocca for me and a filet for my wife with a add on of a $44 dollar lobster tail.   strike two on the saltimbocca, i love this dish normally everywhere. overdone, bland, very salty, presentation three medallions  on a plate that is it. wish i took a picture. the chefs must have phoned it in that night. the filet, below average. not a good cut of meat , which surprised me as this was touted as a great steakhouse.   that was strike three.   we did get a mashed potato side, which was more of a puree. decent. tough to mess up potatoes, lots of butter, and an egg. but somehow this mess was the only bright start because the others were so lacking in shine. \n\nwaiter seemed bored to be there, check came to well over $200 bucks, i still tipped the 20% as it is the holidays and well maybe the main staff was in italy on mario's estate learning all the good things the restaurant has to offer that others have written about.  we wont be back...sorry mario! see my write up on mastro's at the city center. a++", 
            "i sort of feel a little bad giving this place five stars (again) after our recent repeat trip here. after reading all the reviews, i guess service really does make that difference for most people (me included), however, once again we have walked out of this restaurant with happy sighs escaping our lips. \n\nnormally i am not a re-reviewer (tee hee) but our last meal and drinks here in the tavern prompted me. came in on a monday at lunch time and had drinks and burgers in the taverna area. scott, our bartender was great. we ordered two of the $19.00 burgers and as i cringed a little over <mark>The Burger</mark> price, i sipped on my blood orange martini to take the edge off. once <mark>The Burger</mark> arrived i realized i would have paid $25.00 for that burger. hands down the best burger i have ever had in my entire life. the beef was fabulous and topped with a generous thick slice of pancetta and white cheddar? oh my taste buds were singing an aria to mario. my boyfriend orders the house made chips as his side, while i opted for the <mark>Arugula Salad</mark>. we both agreed the <mark>Arugula Salad</mark> was a better choice as its bitterness and tartness balanced out the sheer delicious richness of <mark>The Burger</mark>. oh and the truffle aioli? i can honestly say i have found a mushroom i will eat. scott topped off my martini once too! thanks buddy! they have a special before 5, any two bloody mary's, bellini's, or beers for $11.00 bucks. hey that is a good deal, anywhere.", 
            "we had dinner here two weekends ago with our girls before our 9:30 pm show (phantom). i'm quite surprised with some of the negative reviews here, esp. about the service, because we had a wonderful fine-dining experience. \n\nour server, michael, was professional and knowledgeable and the pacing was perfect. the sommelier on the other hand was just \"ok\". for $50 corkage, i guess i expected a little more service in addition to the accoutrements. she poured at the right time, she did give us the correct glassware, decanted and everything but she really didn't say much. i was expecting for her to at least give us a menu recommendation that will compliment the wine and highlight the food the restaurant has to offer.\n\nthe setting. it was grand and luxurious. yes, there was \"rock\" music playing. not my preference but it wasn't that loud so it didn't really bother me. i just thought the music didn't quite match the atmosphere.\n\nthe wine. carnevino has an impressive wine list but wildly expensive so we brought our own bottle. (we brought one of our favorites, 97 mondavi to kalon, which of course was not on their list.)\n\nthe food. everything was delicious and perfectly prepared. starting with an amuse of \"cheese puff\" from the chef. then the rosemary ciabatta bread served with the savory \"lardo\" spread.  we started with orders of beef carpaccio, raviolo di stracotto (duck liver & balsamic vinegar) and <mark>Arugula Salad</mark> w/coach farm triple goat cheese, trumpet royale mushrooms, & onion pickles. for our main course, we had veal sweetbread primavera, black fettuccine with crab, jalapenos & shallots, \"fall off the bone\" osso buco alla milanese, saffron orzo & gremolata and 8 oz aged <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> <mark>Italian Broccoli with Garlic and Pork</mark> bearnaise. i thought the osso buco could use a tad more flavor but it was good, nonetheless. then we ordered sides of sauteed spinach w/garlic & hot peppers, & creamy mashed potatoes w/poached egg. the poached egg in the mashed potato made it even creamier. it was perhaps the best mashed potato i've ever had.\n\nlast but not the least, the dessert. most of us were too full but managed to share mascarpone panna cotta w/blueberry sauce and espresso gelati, rhubard gelati & blueberry sorbet. both delicious, creamy and refreshing. perfect way to end a fantastic meal.", 
            "we chose carnevino for our fancy dinner out during a recent bachelorette party. we were happy to find that they were able to accommodate our large group (8 girls) for dinner, but were a little paranoid when they told us they'd charge us $50 for each person that didn't show up. they were also really persistent about checking up on us in the days leading up to the dinner - maybe they have a lot of experience with flakes in vegas?\n\nanyway, we were immediately really impressed by the space. it's dim and romantic and very upscale. they put us in a semi-private little nook which i liked because we were still able to see out into the main dining area but still got some privacy. \n\ni have to say the service here was excellent, though i wasn't so impressed with the food. our waiter was really helpful in determining how much we should order and making recommendations, though i did get the impression that he was trying to upsell us. if we ordered as much as he suggested we would have been too stuffed to walk after our meal! however, he took it in stride when we ordered only some of what he recommended. \n\nthe meal started with some tiny little complementary cheese croquettes, which were a small bite and very savory and tasty, as well as a bread basket with choice of butter or lardo to spread on top, which i thought was a nice touch. \n\nto start, we had the <mark>Grilled Octopus</mark> and two of their salads. i enjoyed the <mark>Arugula Salad</mark> with a triple cream cheese but the other starters were not so memorable. we also went with the ribeye, which was yummy but to be honest nothing special compared to other steakhouses i've been too, both expensive and more affordable. we also weren't super impressed with the pastas we had - a black fettucine with crab, a gnocchi and orrechiette with sausage and broccoli. they were all fine but definitely not memorable (i just had to look up the menu on the website to recall what we ordered!) to be honest, the highlight of the meal was the side of mashed potatoes we ordered, which comes with a poached egg and some sort of bacon type meat. it was so indulgent and rich! but i was a bit disappointed that the mashed potatoes were the highlight of this extravagant meal. \n\nthough i was totally impressed with the ambiance and service, the food unfortunately didn't measure up for me. with so many wonderful restaurants in las vegas, i don't think there's time to waste on mediocre expensive meals!", 
            "***carnevino is expensive, but the meat choices (like the <mark>Bone-In New York Strip</mark> and veals chops) as well as the grill octopus and lobster ravioli are very good***\n\nwhile i am not a big fan of las vegas restaurants, mario batali's carnevino definitely excels at putting out great meat dishes.  we had several of their meat offerings including the <mark>Bone-In New York Strip</mark> and the veal chop and both were very good.\n\nthe <mark>Bone-In New York Strip</mark> was a thick cut and it had a great crispy outside sear, which was flavorful.  the meat was very tender.  it was undercooked at rare, but it still had a good flavor (and was of course moist).\n\nthe veal chop was better.  it was also very thick, but it was cooked more appropriately.  veal chops should be between medium rare and medium and this one was.  the meat was moist and tender while the outside crust was distinct and flavorful.  veal can often be a tad bland, but this one had a good flavor.  this was probably the best veal chop i have ever had.\n\nthe <mark>Lamb Chops</mark> were just okay.  unlike the other meats, the <mark>Lamb Chops</mark> were not that thick.  they were a tad overcooked and while they did have a decent flavor and were tender, they were just not as juicy as they should have been.  also, the outside crust was not as good as the veal or the <mark>Bone-In New York Strip</mark>.\n\nwe had two other dishes that were also very good.  one was their <mark>Grilled Octopus</mark>.  i've heard batali's <mark>Grilled Octopus</mark> at osteria mozza is very good.  this one was exceptional.  the octopus was very soft (which can be difficult with octopus) and it had a great flavor.  there were some good pickled vegetables on the side and maybe something else like prosciutto to give it a nice savory flavor.\n\ni have not enjoyed many of batali's pastas, but i did like his lobster anolini.  the lobster filled ravioli was very good--moist with a great lobster flavor.  the cream sauce was mixed with tarragon and it was flavorful and fragrant without being overly buttery or rich.\n\nmost of the other items were in the just okay range.  the <mark>Arugula Salad</mark> featured a triple cream, but the triple cream was surprisingly dry and a little hard.  the bruschetta was okay (as was the big eye tuna crudo).\n\nwe had the pappardelle <mark>Italian Broccoli with Garlic and Pork</mark> mushrooms and while the pasta sheets were good, the pasta went cold quickly.  it was also a little bland.  i was expecting the braised pork agnolotti to have a more impactful filling, but it was not as moist or savory as i was hoping for.  the garnish of chanterelles was good though.  there was a little bit of <mark>Fregula, Pecorino Romano, Butternut Squash</mark> on the plate, but it did not provide the sweet flavor i was expecting.\n\nmost of the sides were just okay (like the spinach and the roasted beets), but the mashed potatoes with mascarpone and a poached egg were rich, creamy and quite good.\n\ni had the flourless chocolate cake for dessert and it was okay.  i am not the biggest fan of flourless chocolate cake because it can be too dry.  while it was a little bit dry, it had a good (but maybe not great) chocolate flavor.\n\nservice was good.  the staff was attentive and the food came out at a good pace.\n\nprices were high (which is common in las vegas), but when you share several of their dishes (family style), you might be able to save a little bit of money.\n\ncarnevino has very high ceilings and a loud atmosphere.  the place has the look of other expensive steakhouses--kind of masculine looking with lots of dark browns.\n\nthe meat at carnevino is very good and it is up there with some of the best a la carte steakhouses i've tried.  i am not the biggest fan of these steakhouses, but carnevino is one of the better ones and they even have a few other good things (like the lobster ravioli) to balance out the meal.\n\ncarnevino is located in the palazzo, which has free parking (valet or self).", 
            "now this is an exercise in restaurant grandeur, and mario batali and his wait staff here do not disappoint.  walking by the restaurant in the palazzo, you do not get the sense of impressiveness; it just looks like a little restaurant tucked away near the entrance of the casino.  however once the maitre'd starts walking you to your table in the main dining room....the experience begins.  i was belittled by the tall ceilings, soaring arches, artwork and the feeling of old italia.  even better is that the restaurant goes on forever, and you'll know what i'm talking about when you go to the restroom (private dining room after private dining room flanked by rustic wooden cabinets filled with bottles and bottles of wine as far as the eye can see.  yeah, this is how they do it here, and it is no joke.  \n\nlet me state that i researched all the top vegas restaurants before deciding to eat here, and so glad we did.  at carnevino you're going to get the best of the best quality ingredients, and classic dishes prepared expertly.  i had the pre-theatre menu, going with the <mark>Tagliata di Manzo</mark> (<mark>Arugula Salad</mark> topped with slices of parmigianino and beef carpaccio), the <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> (medium rare), and the gelati.  we also added in two pasta dishes we wanted to try, beef cheek ravioli and black truffle linguini .... and both were so amazing; pasta perfectly tender and flavors beyond comprehensible.  i would highly recommend trying the pasta -- portions are small so you could easily split one or two.  it just doesn't get any better than the filet at carnevino.  expertly prepared, it is as good as it gets.  the great part about the pre-theatre menu is that you get the same steak on the full menu for a fraction of the price.  the wine list is also beyond.  had the las rocas tempranillo to start, and then went with a full-bodied italian for the steak.  \n\nnow for the service... in a word, top notch.  our waiter was the most articulate and knowledgeable of ingredients, food, preparation i can remember.  he actually got us excited about the history of food...now that is a good waiter. \n\nin sum...carnevino is an experience...so come planning to spend a lot of time having your meal.  my one regret is that we were on our way to a show so couldn't linger for longer. i've been to several of batali's restaurants...del posto, babbo, lupa, and carnevino is my favorite so far.  don't miss this place.", 
            "my bf loveeeeeeeeeeees this place.\n \nbeef carppaccio - 4 stars. thinly sliced, light flavor. very good\n\n<mark>Arugula Salad</mark> -  very good, light oil/lemony flavor and fresh\n\nblack truffle pasta - good, buttery light flavor\n\nbone in rib eye - i had the rib eye... first bite was definitely heaven. i like to be impressed at first bite. i definitely was.\ni did get sick of the steak after a little while, but maybe it was because we ordered so much food.\n\ndo - tell them how you like your steak\nthey tend to cook their steaks a little on the rare side, so when ordering, you should always tell them exactly how you want it based on color.\n\ndon't - let them choose a wine for you\nthey are going to try to sell you whatever over priced bottle they can find. you are better off picking one yourself... if you don't like the taste, be sure to send it back.", 
            "crap. indeed such crap it single handedly put me on a \"famous chef\" hiatus.  my wife and i went to carnevino just for a quick bite. we ordered of the taverna menu as we didn't want the full \"experience.\"\nthe menu came, dirty, stained, and torn; nasty. the server brought out \"a complement from the chef\" some cold, greasy, hush-puppy like dough ball. i asked if it were supposed to be warm and the server said \"yes.\" well, sorry to surprise you, it wasn't.\nwe ordered the <mark>Arugula Salad</mark>, tagliatelle <mark>Italian Broccoli with Garlic and Pork</mark>, and the house made <mark>House-Made Pastrami Sandwich</mark>. the <mark>Arugula Salad</mark> was in a bath of white vinegar and nearly inedible. the tagliatelle was salty enough to choke a cow and cows lick pure salt! but worse, far worse, worst of all, was the <mark>House-Made Pastrami Sandwich</mark>; two massive slabs of dry, crumbly bread, more arugula, and the thinnest of thin slices of pastrami. i didn't see any pastrami so i opened the sandwich removed a slice to taste the pastrami. i still don't know what it tastes like! the horseradish mustard overpowered everything. i combined the two halves of the sandwich into one and it still had less pastrami than a sandwich you'd find in a vending machine at a train station yet just as appetizing!\nfrom now on, if i don't see that damn famous chef in his/her restaurant, i'm not eating there. never, ever again.", 
            "dinner started pretty great with outstanding warm ciabatta, great steak tartar and <mark>Arugula Salad</mark>. however that's when all the greatness stopped and disappointment followed. <mark>Lamb Chops</mark> we ordered were so overly covered in fat i was under the impression they forgot to trim them at all, my duck breast had skin that lacked any crispness and duck confit was so over salted it was tendered inedible. to add insult to injury all sides were extra as meat comes with nothing at all. mashed potatoes were so bland i started thinking they came out of the instant potato pouch, however roasted beets with gorgonzola were great. we skipped deserts after being so disappointed with our main courses and headed to aquanox in the venitian to satisfy our sweet tooth. i have to give credit to the management as they did not charge me for the duck and service overall was good. that's the only reason this restaurant is getting 2 stars in my book instead of one.", 
            "mick jagger once said \"anything worth doing is worth overdoing\". so while in vegas, i decided to send my taste buds on a ride and carnevino was the vessel by which to do that with. \n\nwe were seated in a back area surrounded by walls filled with numerous wine bottles. the waiter went over their specials and suggested some good wine to start us off with. with our wine, he brings us these amazing cheese zeppole's to start our dining adventure.\n\nfor the antipasti, we went with the <mark>Arugula Salad</mark>. the arugula was peppery and contained coach farm triple cream, trumpet royale mushrooms, and pickled onions. the dressing was just tart enough to awaken the taste buds and i knew the rest of the meal was going to be fantastic after how this tasted.\n\nfor my main course, i opted for the 16oz. bone-in ny strip. cooked medium rare, this chunk of heavenly delight was dry-aged to perfection and had a nice rub consisting of sea salt, black pepper and fresh rosemary. the slightly charred crust of the steak and the juiciness of the steak gives carnevino a place in my all-time favorite restaurants. i added a gorgonzola marscapone sauce to accompany the meat but i did not think the meat needed it. i had maybe a couple of bites with it but the meat was so delicious i felt i was doing it a disservice.\n\nwhile the steak was an experience in and of itself, carnevino's sides were also delicious. we had the italian broccoli with house smoked pork. the broccoli was a little more tart than regular broccoli but the waiter warned us about that. we added the marscapone & guanciale mashed potatoes and also indulged in a side of fregula, pecorino romano & corn. taste bud overload was not done because a side of fried eggplant with tomato & ricotta finished things off. all were delicious, but the fregula and eggplant stood out from the crowd.\n\nfor dessert, we had the tiramisu. containing cocoa nibs and homemade marscapone, it was the perfect finale to an amazing meal. i am not naive enough to say carnevino is the best in town. no. instead, i will say that if you are looking for an amazing steak, great ambience, friendly service and an experience one can only get in vegas, then this is one of the better places.", 
            "this is one of the best restaurants ever.  the food is great and the quality of service was superb.  as soon as we check in everyone was so attentive to our needs including checking on us throughout our dining experience.  our waiter also took the time to explain the food, the cut of each part of the bone rib eye and part of their aging process.\n\non to the food.  we ordered <mark>Arugula Salad</mark>, beef cheek ravioli (i believe this was a special for that night), dry aged bone-in rib eye with mash potato and spinach side.  we enjoyed every dish we ordered.  the only dish that we thought was average was the spinach side dish.  the <mark>Arugula Salad</mark> was a great mix of arugula, pickled onions, very creamy goat cheese and mushroom - the mix was very refreshing and went well together.  the beef cheek ravioli was also superb.  it had great taste like a very good pate.  we ordered a medium cooked rib eye and it was just cooked perfectly.  red in the middle and not bloody - red and warm middle vs. of red and cold middle.\n\ni wish we had room for desert unfortunately we were too full to order any.  but overall we enjoyed our dining experience and would eat here again.", 
            "i came to carnevino this past saturday with a group of friends (8 in all).  we all enjoy great food and wine and don't mind paying for it, which you will certainly have to do here. \n\nwe shared a lot of food family style. arugula and <mark>Zach's Chopped Salad</mark> were both excellent. the <mark>Arugula Salad</mark> has some type of pickled onions in it, making it super tasty. we had the <mark>Grilled Octopus</mark>, which was cooked absolutely perfectly, steak tartare and tuna carpaccio. all the apps were spot on. \n\nwe shared 4 pastas for 8 of us and they were all good. the spaghetti frutti di mare was fantastic. all the others, i felt, were too similar and not adequate enough in portion. i feel like a little bit more of them would have been more suitable. \n\nthen, we shared entrees. we had the lamb, which i didn't try but looked good, the porterhouse (amazing!), the salmon (which i found a little boring), the bbl new york (out of this world taste - so super herbaceous and so intense), brussels sprouts (love the simple preparation). \n\nin terms of service... hmmm. i'm torn. our front service seemed absolutely ambivalent about his work there. he did a good job, but kinda seemed \"over it.\"  the back waiter, on the other hand, was super nice. we were in one of the side rooms, which was a little disappointing because you want to be in the middle of the action. we had 4 bottles of wine for the table and both were a great pairing with the food. \n\none last note: in the middle of the waiter's initial menu spiel, i accidentally spilled my $15 glass of wine that i got from the bar.  the waiter didn't refill it. it's subtle, and it isn't that we were in any way lacking for food or wine, but when you're spending $170/person to eat (which is what our bill came out to), i would expect that service point to be paid attention to.", 
            "my husband and i had a lovely first night here. our waiter was kind of enough to suggest that we split the salad, pasta, and steak entree so that we both can share and try everything. the <mark>Arugula Salad</mark> with goat cheese was great. we had the special pasta beef cheek ravioli which was fantastic. finally, the dry-aged <mark>Bone-In New York Strip</mark> was excellent and wasn't gamey at all. they have a nice selection of sauces to go with your steak. definitely, will eat here again on our next visit to vegas!"

            "i guess i had higher expectations eating at batali's restaurant because pizzeria mozza and osteria mozza were both so good. unfortunately, carnevino wasn't as great.  \n\nwe started with their <mark>Zach's Chopped Salad</mark> which was really good for the first few bites. the dressing got a little overwhelming after awhile. there were a lot of spicy peppers in there so if you don't like spicy then you don't wanna order this salad. then we had the dry aged ribeye for two which was cooked the perfect medium rare we requested. flavor was good topped with a little bit of salt and olive oil. we got the yukon potato side which had a unique mashed potato feel to it. it was an interesting little dish but way too salty. we had a bottle of malbec that paired nicely with our dinner. and for dessert we had the apple budino, an americano and green tea. just fyi...skip dessert. the apple budino is nothing like the butterscotch budino at pizzeria mozza. should've just gone with a port wine or something. \n\nthe service started off really good but towards the end i guess our server got swamped with new tables which wasn't a good thing for us. we waited quite some time to get our check. we had to hurry up and pay and get our gambling on. the hosts were very pleasant when we walked in and when we left the restaurant. \n\nambiance was great and the decor was sophisticated. i would come back to try different dishes even though my first experience here was just mediocre. if this mediocrity happens again...i'm gonna stick with my kona crusted steak at capital grille down the street. \n\ncome on batali~! step it up~! you're better than this~!", 
            "i was incredibly satisfied with the quality of service and delicious food!\ni came here with a group of girls and we shared our main courses in pairs, so we could try a bit of everything.  we got the <mark>Zach's Chopped Salad</mark>, rib eyes for 2, <mark>Lamb Chops</mark>, fillet mignon, and a few sides, and everything came out perfectly cooked and delicious.  i'm not a big meat eater but i finished my portion of the rib eye.  i loved the fact they cut our giant rib eye for 2 at the table.  they cut them into perfect portions and plated them onto individual plates for us.  the steak knives were cool looking too, not the typical steak knives you usually get at a steak house.  \nthe wine list was huge, it was the entire 3 out of 4 pages of the menu.  they have a lot of good offerings for glasses of wine or by the bottle. \ni would definitely come here again when i'm in vegas.", 
            "this is the third mario battali place i have dined at. babbo and enoteca san marco being the other two- this was right on par with babbo!! the hostess was extremely nice without coming across as vegas cheesy- which happens alot.  wine list was above average but adnittedly, i am not up to speed on the italian wines. i decided to venture out and let the sommelier pick based on my likes for the table- he nailed it! dinner went like this:\nclams by the dozen\n\"al forno\" with pancetta and fresno chilies\n\"<mark>Zach's Chopped Salad</mark>\"\nbeans, pepperoncini, parmigiano\nricotta and egg raviolo\ndry aged bone in ribeye\n<mark>Bone-In New York Strip</mark>\n\"spago\" with lamb ragu\n\nthis was shared by 6 guys and we were stuffed afterwards! each dish was exceptional whether it was pasta or meat- which was cooked perfectly! the drizzle of olive oil on the steak was perfection as well. it was a little pricey compared to some other places- but worth every penny of it! will definitely revisit every trip to vegas- which is a minimum 4 times a year! big fan", 
            "freakin' good!  maybe it's what people order or when we go, but we weren't disappointed with a thing.  started off with the focaccia bread that they pass around, nice and hot.  we shared the <mark>Zach's Chopped Salad</mark>, it had the right amount spice with chopped jalapenos, crisp romaine, shaved and chopped parmesan cheese.  one salad was enough to share between two people.  i had the black fettucini with crab, jalapenos and a garlic like sauce.  i wasn't spicy, but the flavors blended very nicely.  he ordered the <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> with the crab bernaise sauce on top.  he said it was one of the best steaks he has eaten ever.  we shared the mashed potatoes side dish.  ohhhhh, so good.  mashed potatoes with marscapone cheese and a soft cooked egg, a little bacon, stirred together and it was like eating heaven.  for dessert we shared cookies for one and espresso gelato.  a great finish to a fantastic meal.\n\nwe did see a lot of people ordering the ribeye, but the filet looked ten times better.", 
            "i realize that vegas and overpriced go hand in hand, particularly when wining and dining on the strip, but among my dining experiences in this city i'd rank this in the lower percentile when justifying the hit my bank account takes.  it boiled down to service and overall value.\n\nwe were lured in by mario batali's name being on the door.  we were greeted and seated promptly in a low-lit dining room of dark, rich wood and wine lining the back wall.  the entire albums of keane and u2 played during the course of our meal, which i found not to fit with the intended ambience, but oh well.\n\nwhile our server was friendly and seemed knowledgeable, beginning with ordering our wine i felt like he would suggest nothing but the most expensive things on the menu.  for example, after passing on a $21 glass of chardonnay and inquiring about another good white wine, i was referred to the $18 option.  \n\nand so it continued with our entrees--apparently we would be missing the holy grail not to have ordered every single course, including the $65 ribeye--so when my dining companion and i honed in on pasta (we had eaten on the plane and weren't starving), our server seemed put off, even moreso when we chose the appetizer size.  i even got the \"are you sure?  you're only going to get this much [gesturing to the bread plate].\"  at that point, yes--i was very sure.\n\nthat aside our meal was pretty enjoyable.  we started by sharing the cured meats plate and <mark>Zach's Chopped Salad</mark>, which was full of flavor with beans, parmesean and just the right amount of dressing.  for the entree my dining companion had black fettucine with crab and jalapeno, and i had the potato gnocchi, which was ok but could've had a little more flavor.  may i add it arrived on a plate larger than the bread plate.\n\noverall, i feel like the experience didn't live up to the name.  sorry, mario.", 
            "a great dining experience.  the food was amazing, from our barratta bruschetta, <mark>Zach's Chopped Salad</mark>, pastas, ny strip, porter house....all the way to our delicious desserts.  we knew the portions would be large (they don't hide that fact....they tell you that \"for 2\" serving serves up 26 oz, so we ordered accordingly).  we had the best waiter ever (gary) who adjusted the order to our appetites and suggested a mix of dishes for our table of six.  gary couldn't have done a better job.  one of the few star chef restaurants in vegas that is up to par (and surpasses) their nyc fare.  excellent!", 
            "fantastic! \n\nvisited this establishment last week while in vegas for valentines day.\n\nfirst off, giulio (sp) our server, was amazing. top notch. most likely the best server i have had at a restaurant period. his recommendations steered us to a fantastic dining experience, he offered us a few things off the menu including an appetizer that was superb, and a special gelato flavor for dessert that was unbelievable. \n\nseating was delayed about 10 minutes past our reservation, but it was valentine's day night, and i will excuse it, realistically, it happens. \n\nwe had the <mark>Zach's Chopped Salad</mark> and a tri-tip ravioli as our appetizers, i sampled both and they were both very good. the salad has a nice kick from the peppers to it, and the ravioli was served with a 25 year aged balsamic that topped it beautifully. \n\nmain course was the 90 day dry-aged rib-eye, which is carved table side. giulio did recommend that we order it medium instead of medium-rare as we asked, stating that the medium here is closed to a traditional medium-rare. i was very glad we did as it was cooked perfectly. the meat just melted and while the rib-eye is pricey (72$ each) there was a very large portion served, and the quality of the meat spoke for the price. \n\ni try to visit one high-end steakhouse with each trip to vegas, and so far carnevino takes the cake. definitely make a reservation, and ask for giulio as he was amazing.",

            "### (11/12/2012) ### : i got a chance to reserve the ny strip riserva since they didn't have a ribeye.  i figured it's still a good steak.  boy was i wrong.  it was an amazing steak! even since eating at peter luger's over 12+ years ago i have always been comparing almost all steakhouses to pl and none has ever come close.... well, maybe just one or two bites of the steak.  \n\ntoday, everything has changed.  i'm sorry to say that peter luger has been dethroned by carnevino.  the only problem is carnevino is on the other side of the coast!!!  oh well... i'm going to try in the few days i have left to get the ribeye riserva.  every bite was good and so flavorful.\n\ni tried one of the sauce (cv steak sauce) but the steak was so good i couldn't bear to dip it.  \n\nthe bread with lardo and cured port fat was interesting but i still prefer good old butter.  i also had the <mark>Zach's Chopped Salad</mark> which was ok but nothing to brag home about.  if you want good <mark>Zach's Chopped Salad</mark> try the one from outback (yes, i said outback for the salad only).\n\n### update 1 (11/13/2012) ### : it was so good i went again today.  i opted for the 1 1/2\" instead of the usual 1\" riserva ny steak.  i was a bit disappointed even the steak tasted great it was more overcooked than what i would like which is a medium rare more on the rare side.  the cut was also different. yesterday's cut was closer to a t-bone.  today was just one side of the bone. maybe because it was custom cut that they got it from a different end.  in anycase, it still tasted great but mostly toward the end where it was closer to medium rare by the bone.  probably because it was so thick they couldn't cook it right?  i have 2 more days left in vegas so i'll be going there probably two more times.  that goes to show how good it tastes and will write updates.  i hope during the next two days that a ribeye does come in.  i'm really looking forward to that cut!", 
            "we went mostly on a recommendation by a review book so we eagerly anticipated a wonderful aged beef experience. the reality, however, left us questioning the rating system all together!  wine list is impressive. lots of choices by the glass and the malbec i chose was nice. i ordered the tuna antipasto and it was good.... not special, but good. ditto on my wife's <mark>Zach's Chopped Salad</mark>. we both ordered steak. i chose the bone in filet and my wife went bone in ny strip. i skipped the available sauce addition thinking that a great steak needs nothing. bad move. \n\nfirst, and probably most annoying was the visually impressive steak knives triumphantly placed at our table. red handled, full run of steel and as dull as children's scissors. and not just mine, my wife's was super dull also. we hacked our way through what was supposed to be a wonderful steak experience and really made a mess of the cut while wearing out our hands and patience simultaneously. steaks were prepared correct but lacked flavor. at 85 for a steak i expect a wow factor, not costco grade. \n\nside of cauliflower with what seemed to be a b\\u00e9chamel sauce of sorts was ok but i've ,had similar at friends weekday dinner parties. once again.  not special.  service was ok but not special either ( recurring theme here) \n\ncut, the widely acclaimed wolfgang puck steakhouse,  was booked so we chose carnevino the batali steakhouse... never again.....dull knives at a high end steakhouse.... unbelievable....3 stars are due to the wine....... without its a two star...", 
            "i almost don't even know where to start. i went here on valentines day and the thing that i will always remember about cv is that you do not go to nice restaurants on valentines day. \n\ni had 7:30 reservations for two. arrived two minutes late, but was promptly seated. good start. its a beautiful restaurant and i like how they store the wine in the cabinets all around you.\n\nour server, jb , came over to introduce himself and the menu. here is where things start to go south. i mentioned that i had been looking at the menu online in anticipation of what was to be an amazing dinning experience. he still tells us to look it over and proceed to visit every table around us for the next 31 minutes.  he finally comes back, and takes our dinner order and drink order. 15 minutes later the drink arrives. so lets recap: 31 mins to place dinner order when i said i already knew what i wanted, and 46 minutes to get a drink.  \n\nthe salads were the best part of the whole experience. <mark>Zach's Chopped Salad</mark> was very good, if a little heavy on the hominy. the standard 'caesar'( although they don't call it that) is also very good. \n\n45 minutes after i get my 1st drink the food arrives, total time in seat ~1.5 hours. \n\nthe steak looked amazing , it was the $150 aged, bone-in ribeye for two. jb said it was what they are known for. the tableside preparation was nice and it really is a big hunk of meat, but at the very end they \"season\" it by putting two crystals of sea salt on the massive amount of steak and then drown it in olive oil.   \n\n(side note: i said hello and happy v-day to another server who was helping jb cut and serve the steak. he rolled his eyes and let out a sigh, to which jb replied \" only a couple more hours man\".... i'm right freaking next to you dude, i have ears! wtf?)\n\nbut back to the steak. it was tasteless, it had no flavor, other than olive oil. the texture was great but there was just nothing to get excited over. i should have just sent it back and ordered something else.   \n\ninstead, i asked for two different sauces, a gorgonzola and something else. both just sucked.  the gorgonzola was like a semi-solid cheese paste.\n\nwe had also ordered a maine lobster tail, trying to make our own surf-and-turf  for the special occasion.  of course, jb forgot to enter it into the system so it never arrived. \n\ni had had just about enough of this joke of service being rendered to us and i asked to talk to the general manager, jb heard something else because the floor supervisor or assistant manager or something came over, i told him i was in the qsr industry and how much the service and food were lacking , he didn't care. the only thing he listened to was when i said i am not trying to get out of paying the bill, then he said okay, picked up my card and rang it. \n\ni never , ever ask to see management. i guess in my mind i was thinking that if i let him know now, how awful the service and product was, he would take control of the situation, try and rectify it in some way , any way... yes a discount or removal of stuff from my ticket would have been nice and probably the right thing to do. he did absolutely nothing. so congrats dude! i am now an anti-brand ambassador for carnevino and i will be sure to tell everyone that i can.\n\nfinally wrapping up dinner, i usually drink more during special occasions and like to finish it off with espresso after a nice dessert, i did neither, i just wanted out of there. i had my $150 dollar steak wrapped up and they brought the claim ticket out, after talking to the manager-whatever i tore up my ticket and left it on the table. \n\nnow that my review is almost over i feel better letting the world know what to expect from this place. i would really like to be contacted by someone @palazzo or cv , but in the corporate, dollar 1st attitude that predominates the strip now i seriously doubt that will happen. \n\nand hotel/casinos wonder why they have a hard time bringing locals to the strip? \n\ntruly a zero star review.", 
            "bummer. this was not a favorite during our time in vegas.  the 3.5 stars currently on yelp is a pretty accurate rating for carnevino.\n\nwe enjoyed:\n- ian (our server's assistant) he was awesome and favorite part of carnevino\n- peanut butter/chocolate dessert that was like a huge candybar ... yum!\n- ian because he was so awesome he is worth mentioning twice\n- zachs <mark>Zach's Chopped Salad</mark> which was very good and a great start to our meal\n\nwe were indifferent to:\n- our entrees of a steak dish and scallops. eh pretty boring.\n- beef agnolotti with onion ragu\n\nwe hated:\n- the layout is awkward and tables are far too close, luckily there are loud speakers playing music right. by. your. head. so you really can't hear anyone elses conversations (or your own)\n- bread, butter, lardo - not as exciting as we thought based on reviews from others\n\nwe shared a salad and a pasta starter, then each got our own entrees. it was the perfect amount of food. the salad being a bit larger and more than enough to share. the pasta was smaller with only 4 or 5 bites per person, but enough for us on that particular night.\n\noverall it was fine, just nothing memorable nor anything we'd ever go back to do again. the service was forced and awkward (and since we were so close to all of our dining mates we were able to hear our servers spiel only about half a dozen times which got old quickly).", 
            "so why oh why is this place so poorly rated?! my boyfriend had to practically drag me here after reading the reviews on this place. when we arrived we were seated in a vaulted ceiling dining room with some old world type of decor. there is def a theme of bulls and beef all over this place. our server julio was awesome! he explained the menu and made a few recommendations. we over ordered as usual and started with the scallops appetizer. it was really really good. had a minty, limey (is that a word?) tang to it! seared to a perfect crispy crust and a juicy center! my boyfriend is a huge fan of beef tar tar. i personally can't get over the fact it's raw. he ordered it and nearly ate every last bite! i also opted for a <mark>Zach's Chopped Salad</mark> which i honestly could of done without. it wasn't really anything special in my book. since it is an italian steakhouse we had to order a pasta dish. our server told us of two specials and we went with a beef filled ravioli. yummmmyyyy! it had this truffle sauce with a basil topping....i could of had that for my whole meal!! just went we were starting to feel full and mind you a little tipsy from wine, our baby came out! a shared 30/40 oz bone in ribeye which was cut and dived up table side by a guy who liked like he could carve up just about anything with a butter knife. talk about skill! to be honest i like my steak a little more cooked than what came out but the end pieces were perfect for me! my boyfriend cleared his plate and i took a stab at the bone. there was some crispy delightful little pieces that clung to the bone for dear life. it's needless to say that they did not live for long! we finished with some port wine and a chocolate peanut butter torte. it was like a candy bar on steroids! i've used the word yummy way to many times in this review but the words to describe what it tasted like escape me as my mouth remembers that full flavor. we ended with some desert wine which was great but i can't remember the name of it. over all i was impressed with the service, the decor was kinda whatever but the food was really memorable! we spent a good 3 hours dining and i enjoyed every part of it! highly recommend this place!!", 
            "i have been to carnevino several times, and i have never been disappointed. i love walking through the shops at the palazzo before dinner. the atmosphere is relaxed and inviting, and they always do a great job accomodating those who eat gluten free. on my last visit, two of my friends were gluten free, and they were able to eat almost everything due to the variety of gluten free options.\n\non this visit, i started with <mark>Zach's Chopped Salad</mark> with salumi and parmigiano. delicious!! our table shared a few pasta dishes. the most notable were the orechiette with sweet sausage and brocolli rabe and the bucatini with amatriciana sauce. i loved the way the orechiette soaked up the sausage bits. yum! the pancetta in the bucatini dish was fabulous as well.\n\none friend and i had the florentine porterhouse for 2 and it was outstanding. they carve the meat tableside, and it is a really fun experience. the beef was perfectly cooked, it was just unfortunate that i was already full by this point. the italian brocolli we had on the side was garlicky and scrumptious. \n\nwe were beyond stuffed by this point, so we passed on dessert, but every option on the menu looked delicious. carnevino also had a vast selection of italian wines, and the staff is incredibly helpful in aiding in pairings and such. i can't wait to go back!",

            "i came to carnevino this past saturday with a group of friends (8 in all).  we all enjoy great food and wine and don't mind paying for it, which you will certainly have to do here. \n\nwe shared a lot of food family style. arugula and <mark>Zach's Chopped Salad</mark> were both excellent. the <mark>Arugula Salad</mark> has some type of pickled onions in it, making it super tasty. we had the <mark>Grilled Octopus</mark>, which was cooked absolutely perfectly, steak tartare and tuna carpaccio. all the apps were spot on. \n\nwe shared 4 pastas for 8 of us and they were all good. the spaghetti frutti di mare was fantastic. all the others, i felt, were too similar and not adequate enough in portion. i feel like a little bit more of them would have been more suitable. \n\nthen, we shared entrees. we had the lamb, which i didn't try but looked good, the porterhouse (amazing!), the salmon (which i found a little boring), the bbl new york (out of this world taste - so super herbaceous and so intense), brussels sprouts (love the simple preparation). \n\nin terms of service... hmmm. i'm torn. our front service seemed absolutely ambivalent about his work there. he did a good job, but kinda seemed \"over it.\"  the back waiter, on the other hand, was super nice. we were in one of the side rooms, which was a little disappointing because you want to be in the middle of the action. we had 4 bottles of wine for the table and both were a great pairing with the food. \n\none last note: in the middle of the waiter's initial menu spiel, i accidentally spilled my $15 glass of wine that i got from the bar.  the waiter didn't refill it. it's subtle, and it isn't that we were in any way lacking for food or wine, but when you're spending $170/person to eat (which is what our bill came out to), i would expect that service point to be paid attention to.", 
            "a few caveats before my comments; i was there at lunch and invited to order certain items off the dinner menu should i desire. i know bolognese as a cook and an enthusiast. my experience was excellent except for the bolognese. \n\ni was suspicious to eat at a restaurant where the owners are celebs and not-resident, so my expectations were cynical. but as a bolognese fanatic i wanted to experience the batali-bastianich version, as i thought this was/is their collective wheelhouse. i was quite disappointed to find it to be a bright, red sauce with meat \"pebbles' instead of the rusty-colored, velvety sauce accomplished with hours of patience. the excellent server, while helping me choose a perfect glass of wine, countered my expectation that this dish would be rich by helpfully offering that there was a \"little bit of cream\" but that it wasn't rich. i didn't pick up on the hint but should have(!) as many recipes call for a decent addition of milk, and a reduction, (one of many reductions) as opposed to cream, which sounds like a 'quick' bolognese; definitely what i was served. the pasta was a penne rigata and i was told it was fresh, house-made and i believe it, because it was dense and chewy; i would have opted for a tagliatelle which in my world is the most expected. i left most of the pasta behind. \n\nmy server (nicole) was extremely helpful and introduced me to a wine i loved and would not have found on my own. the <mark>Zach's Chopped Salad</mark> was really, really good. (again, i ordered it to 'cut' the richness but found it to be the star of my meal) loved the lardo 'butter' and the rolls were worth the carbs. \n\ni enjoyed the decor and for those who want to enjoy the casino, it's right on the edge of the action. the bar looked like they planned to have people standing in it (this is so often missed!) and i would give this place another chance since it is, after all, meant to be a steakhouse, and i didn't go that route. but i submit this review to warn it is not a place to see what a great bolognese should be.", 
            "fantastic across the board. the ambiance and decor are upscale and relaxed. the service is impeccable, and the food and wine list are outstanding. we started with the <mark>Zach's Chopped Salad</mark> and <mark>Grilled Octopus</mark>. the <mark>Grilled Octopus</mark> was amazingly well executed. it had a nice char but was not overcooked or rubbery at all. highly recommended. next we had the grilled asparagus, spinach with bacon, <mark>Italian Broccoli with Garlic and Pork</mark> steak. the asparagus was nicely charred but still crisp and crunchy and the porterhouse was amazing. we decided to split the steak (portion for 2) among three because they looked huge. i'm glad we did. the steak was monstrous and with the sides easily fed three people. overall a great experience and highly recommended just be prepared to shell out some $$", 
            "this is supposed to be an italian steakhouse restaurant. the rosemary bread (stale) was served with a dish of lard and a dish of butter, neither ever served in italy (where is the olive oil?). the <mark>Zach's Chopped Salad</mark> was full of cabbage - also never found in italy (maybe in germany like the lard). the salad had no dressing and none of the italian cheese or meat that was suppposed to be in it. the ricotta and egg raviolo had a raw egg yolk in it which when cut into ran all over the plate (the egg yolk should be thickened like eggs benedict). it was gross. the <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> was so tough that i had to squash the filet against the plate using the red handled steak knife they supplied to cut through it. it was cooked properly medium rare. there was no salt and pepper on the table.  we asked for some and they brought out a small dish with large crystals of salt (imported from london they said).  they said to pick some up and grind it between your thumb and forefinger to break down the large salt crystals. i don't like grinding my salt myself and it is not very sanitary. my wife ordered the veal. it was served floating in a dish of brown water.  she was looking for a place to pour off all the liquid so she could eat the veal but there was no way to do this. we ordered sparkling water.  they said it is trucked in from montana and filtered 7 different ways. the water tasted like plain water - san pelligrino water would have been much better. this restaurant is trying to be trendy and failing. i ordered a grappa for after dinner. they served it in a very small wine type glass, only around 1/4 of a shot. at least my wife's grand marnier after dinner drink was 1 shot is size. i do not recommend this restaurant and it is not italian.",

            "a lot of mixed reviews on this one. some 3s, some 5s. i'll go with the middle option. here's why:\n\nstarting with the food: the complimentary parmesan balls that a few other yelpers have mentioned are delicious, and a nice small start to what ended up being a really great meal. appetizers shared by the table included the <mark>Insalata Romana</mark> and a daily special which consisted of a baked bread topped with burrata and ramps. the special was quite tasty -- the ramps provided a very subtle complement to the burrata. the salad, on the other hand, comes with anchovies that overpowered everything else about the salad.\n\na friend and i split the florentine porterhouse which was delicious - very nice crusting on the outside and cooked to a excellent-looking medium rare on the inside. really didn't think it could get any better until the friend, who had been previously and gotten the same cut, ordered the additional <mark>Gorgonzola Mascarpone</mark> (one of around six sauce options). amazing. this definitely elevated the porterhouse a few steps and i now consider it the best steak i've ever had. the grilled spinach with hot peppers provided a nice spicy vegetable side which had just the right amount of kick without leaving you with an aftertaste that might otherwise interfere with the steak.\n\nso why, with all that, am i giving mario's steakhouse a four star review? a  few annoyances: first, the service was just average with a few missteps along the way; the biggest problem came when the steak florentine presentation came out. we had ordered medium rare and the steak was indeed medium rare. however, the line chef had written medium on the ticket and our waiter announced what the chef had written. we caught this and let them know we definitely wanted the medium rare. they went and double checked, but in between they had to roll the whole presentation tray back in, pretty humorous but a bit odd. next, the   atmosphere seemed off. from what i glanced quickly on my way out, they may have another (possibly main) dining room in the other half of the restaurant, but our party was placed in the other side of the split which was open-air to the casino. now i love my hometown, and the palazzo has a very good smoke filtration system, so it's not that bad, but i can't for the life of me figure out any reason you'd want the noises and scenery of the casino right there. it really seems like an odd and definitely annoying choice.\n\nso because of all that, and the fact that they couldn't seem to do a $18 salad right. four stars.", 
            "okay, i am a huge of mario batali. he just seems like a fun guy to hang around... so, when the opportunity arose for a chance to go to one of his restaurants, i jumped at it!\n\nbefore going, i reserved a table online from the restaurant's website. as far as wait time, i can not comment. when it came to seating, we were not seated a minute before our time... this kind of peeved me a little bit, but not enought to ding the entire experience. they did, however, seat us on time... i was just getting excited and wanted to be seated early. \n\non to the food: we ordered off the pre-theater menu. it was $49 each for a three-course meal. the menu offered 2 or 3 items to choose from for each course. pre-ordering, the chef does bring out little nibblets... that night it was some cheese ball. very tasty, it was. \n\ni had ordered the <mark>Insalata Romana</mark>, <mark>Filet Mignon</mark>, and vanilla bean gelato. the filet does not come with a side, everything is a la cart... so i ordered a side of mascarpone & guanciale mashed potatoes. \n\nthe salad was actually stacked kind of like an iceberg wedge, but with slivers of radichio inbetween every couple layers of romaine lettuce. on top, was a large crouton with an anchovy laying on top. the dressing was well balanced, not too salty or oily from the anchovy, nor was the garlic too over-powering. \n\nthe filet (i ordered medium-rare) was cooked perfectly. cool center, red throughout, and browned exterior with a single set of score lines on top and bottom. it was seasoned nicely and felt well balanced with the salt to meat ratio.\n\nthe mascarpone & guanciale mashed potatoes created a very hearty dish. it came out in a little skillet and was very hot (temp). let this guy cool down for a bit before attacking it. it did have an egg on top that the waiter mixed into the dish before handing the fork over to me. the dish was very rich and creamy from the mascarpone. the guanciale (italian bacon) was tasty and provided little bacon morsels to find and i ate. it was fun finding those little bits... remember folks, bacon is a major food group!\n\nthe gelato felt more crisp than the street vendors. i wouldn't say that it was as creamy as you can get elsewhere, but the flavor was particularly crisp. i enjoyed it.\n\ni know it has floated down the board that you can get lardo for a spread on your ciabatta. yes, you can. i tried it and was pleasantly surprised at the texture. it was like eating a spoonful of mayonaise and slowly drags down your tongue. it was seasoned with parmesan and rosemary and therefore tasted great. don't be scared to try it folks!!\n\ni know this is a really long review, but i'm almost done! the finale is the wine selection. for those that followed the tv show \"master chef\", chef joe (one of the judges) is mario's partner for this restaurant. he has his own private label of wine called bastianich (sp??). try the bianco vespa, it was a truly wonderful white-wine blend. \n\nwould i go back? yes, in a heartbeat i would.", 
            "thanks a lot mario batali and joe bastianich for my complimentary steakhouse blinders!  i haven't been able to stop raving about the entire dinner to my friends, family, peers, and frankly anyone who i can make green with envy.  we've been to a few other well established steakhouses on the las vegas strip, but you know when you've decided to go all out for a nice, fancy meal, you may or may not be like me and search \"number one _______ restaurant in vegas\" just to see what the consensus is out there.  such was the case for our most recent adventure in sin city and carnevino outranked the rest on many sites so we gave it a try.  \n\nthe kind service was what we noticed first and no, we don't mean from our waiter (yet).  we were set to fly in on 9/11/12 around 16:00 and what was supposed to be a quick 48 minute flight turned into our 21:00 dinner reservation being canceled last minute and us running to catch a cirque show we already had tickets to at 22:30 because we didn't arrive until 20:30 to our hotel.  turns out we decided to fly on the one day las vegas and its surrounding areas had flash flood warnings and torrential down pour crazy enough to practically rain out the bellagio fountain show.  we kept pushing back our reservations for dinner first from 19:00 to 20:00, then to 21:00 with a possibility of 21:30.  either way, the hostesses were super sweet and courteous about the entire debacle and helped us feel like our safety was actually important to them too!  we ended up making another reservation a few days later and luckily were able to make it then. \n\nwe were greeted warmly and were promptly seated in a well lit area (a part of me cries when it's so dim in a restaurant that you can't see your own hand in front of you let alone the food they expect you to blindly put in your mouth as a result).  our waiter chris (i'm going to play the race card and say that he was asian because he deserves some great recognition for his dedication and integrity - ran out to find us on the palazzo gaming floor to correct a discrepancy on our check - and frankly with a name like chris, how else can we describe the guy?!) shows up and we have a great conversation about the menu and he gives us some time to decide after offering up a few of his own suggestions.  i cannot stress enough that it was a conversation about the menu and not some long drawn out, pretentious lecture about the food which is not fun to say the least. \n\nobligatory bread service? yes.  \n\nobligatory butter on the side? yes. \n\n.........oh i forgot to mention the heavenly lardo that is served with it.  it almost hurts to talk about it and not be able to access it until our next adventure to vegas...literally hurts.  pardon me while i zone out for a moment reminiscing about the sexiness that is the lardo spread on a freshly baked piece of bread....\n\nwe decide on:\n\n<mark>Insalata Romana</mark> with a sweet garlic dressing = nice and light with lots of radicchio (a little more bitter than i'm used to)\n\nspaghetti ai frutti di mare = check with your server about the size of the plate - it was enough for two to share, maybe three as an appetizer.  how can you go to a batali affiliated restaurant and not have any pasta right?  this dish was slightly spicy with clams, giant shrimp, lobster, and calamari....oh and i forgot it was cleared away with a piece of my soul. *sigh*\n\ndry aged bone-in ribeye for 2 = at $144, it was well worth the interrogation we gave chris about how it was cooked.  we had read reviews that at carnevino they generally under cook their meat and as a 'medium rare' type of girl myself and my boyfriend a 'medium' aficionado himself, after a patient round of \"it's your birthday babe, it's your choice\" and \"no, no i'm okay with whatever\" we settled on medium and it was absolutely perfect for the both of us.  i'd almost recommend that to anyone and everyone since having one of these cuts of meat as 'well done' is just plain wrong.  to clarify - this gorgeous cut of meat (and i don't mean my boyfriend for once) required no sauce of any kind in my humble opinion.  \n\nmascarpone guanciale mashed potatoes = served with a raw egg yolk on top and stirred in with the hot potatoes at the table it will make you seriously consider if you ever need to try any other kind of mashed potatoes ever again.  in fact, i've pretty much convinced myself that all other mashed potatoes are merely impersonators and they only reason we can't have mascarpone guanciale mashed potatoes every day is because of the cholesterol intake from the egg yolk.  please don't take this away from me...\n\n\"creamed\" corn with lime and picked chilies = described as a seasonal item, it wasn't so much the typical creamed corn that one might be used to - hence the quotation marks made sense.  still delicious. \n\nrunning out of space to type...all i can say is you deserve to go at least once in your lifetime.  now, be a little spontaneous, pick up the phone and go!!"

            "i am so damn broke.  damn you mario batali & joseph bastianich.\n\nwe stayed at the palazzo so we figured... we might as well choose a restaurant within the property and finally decided on carnevino.  the restaurant itself is pretty big and we were brought all the way to the back, which was nice since it wasn't as loud as the main dining room and the high ceiling definitely makes it a nicer place to dine at.\n\nafter looking through the menu, the server somehow convinced us to go the \"family-style\" way, which is priced at a minimum of $100 per person but he would have the chefs prepare the top dishes in each course to share: 5 appetizers, 4 pastas, and 5 different cuts of meat.  he also guaranteed that we would not go hungry even though it was 9 guys.  \n\nit ended up as one of the most expensive meals but pretty legit.  they started out by bringing rosemary infused bread that everybody gets with 2 kinds of spread: housemade butter and flavored pork back fat.  yes, pork back fat, aka lard.  don't be scared cause it was amazing haha.\n\n for appetizers, they brought out:\n\n1. <mark>Insalata Caprese</mark> - amazing caprese salad with thick slices of heirloom tomatoes and a mozarella & cream combo called burrata.\n2. <mark>Grilled Octopus</mark> - freaking amazing.  i never had octopus that tender and the limoncello reduction over it was genius.  \n3. <mark>Fried Calamari</mark> - common item... but damn when it is done this well, i don't want it anywhere else. \n4. hanger steak carpaccio - special of the night and pretty much a pile of arugula with a delicious steak carpaccio underneath and over it.\n5. <mark>Affettati Misti</mark> - selection of house cured meats with a variety of grilled peppers.  the pork belly seriously just melts in your mouth.\n6. grilled foie gras - umm..... yes yes yes.  i think they drizzled a balsamic reduction over it too.  crap.. i'm seriously drooling right now.\n\nas for the pastas, each dish are all appetizer servings but if you want, you can add $15 more to make it into entree size.  all the pasta dishes are much more about the ingredients.  they brought out:\n\n1. potato gnocchi bolognese - just.. really really solid gnocchi with a really good bolognese.  wish there was more bolognese though.\n2. puttanesca - olives, capers, and anchovies with penne.  simple but so good.\n3. beef cheek ravioli - beef cheek = one of the most tender cut of meat ever and they even drizzle aged real balsamic over it.  yea.  heaven.\n4. black truffle pasta - when this came out, i was just... at a loss for words since it had real shaved slices of black truffle all over it rather than the typical truffle oil you see at many places.  the spaghetti itself with made with extra yolk too so the texture was amazing.  favorite out of all.\n\nfor the meats, they bring it all out and they carve it off the bone right in front of you:\n\n1. veal chop - tender, perfectly done.  the bone-in probably gave it extra flavor.\n2. dry-aged bone-in ribeye - i love the seasoning and the crust.  italian seasoned steaks is just good eating.  i still think gallagher's dry-age beef is better though!\n3. <mark>Lamb Chops</mark> - ok this was the best lamb i've had.  i'm not a big fan of lamb because of the gaminess, but somehow it's all good and it is absolutely amazing.  \n4. <mark>Pork Chop</mark> - done medium well, and the way it is brined gives what seems like a really boring piece of pork good flavors.\n5. maine lobster tail - they only brought out one so it was kinda hard to share among all of us but... it was buttery goodness!  hahah.\n\nthey also brought out two sides: mashed potatoes with marscapone & guanciale (type of unsalted bacon) with raw egg yolk mixed in, and sauteed mushrooms & onions.  both were perfect as side dishes.\n\nat first we were afraid that we weren't gonna get full since the appetizer and pastas' portions were not big at all but after everything, we couldn't finish all the protein and it ended up being the perfect late night snack after xs :p\n\nif you come with a big group, definitely think about getting the \"family-style\" since you'll get to truly taste what carnevino is all about.  just expected to drop... quite a bit of money especially if you order wine and after the 20% gratuity charge.", 
            "went there for a celebration dinner over the labor day weekend and glad we did!\n\nmario batali is an amazing chef, i try to keep track of all the shows he does on tv, even get inspiration for my own cooking from him (never copy). we sort of stumbled on the restaurant while walking around palazzo and venetian and immediately i wanted to go, after changing into the best clothes we brought with us, of course! \n\nso, we went in with a feeling of honor and excitement and very high expectations. and, boy, were they met! their service was amazing, at first we thought 4 or 5 people were waiting just exclusively on us, but than asked and turns out they all work as a team and keep an eye on all the tables and don't let a dirty plate or an empty glass go without notice, everything is cleaned up and refilled momentarily!!!\n\nnow the food. oh the food! i decided not to worry about my waistline and talked my companion out of any guilty feelings he may have had! we ordered  <mark>Insalata Caprese</mark> to share, and a bottle of sicilian wine (their wine list is just unfair, it takes up 2.5 pages on huge menu sheets!). \n\nwhile we waited for the main courses, someone brought freshly whipped butter and a lardo with rosemary spread with warm chiabata rolls then came duck liver pasta and gnocchi with gorgonzola and nut sprinkled  beets and baby <mark>Italian Broccoli with Garlic and Pork</mark> (only sure about half of the dishes, the ones i ordered). it all looked and smelled delicious! like a childhood memory i've never had! \n\nwe also ordered desert, which i did not have room for, but tried a bit anyway, looked fabulous! \n\nnot something we would do every day, the bill came to about $100 per person, but it is so worth it!", 
            "we checked in at the front desk since we were there a lil early for our dinner reservations. the people there were really nice and chatty (in a good way). when everyone in our party arrived, we followed someone to our table. there were 8 of us, so we got this semi-private booth, which we liked. the ambience was dim and semi-quiet, although i felt like our group was being the complete opposite. we couldn't suppress our laughter. opps, sorry. \n\nthey gave us complimentary piece of bread with 2 spreads, regular butter and one made out of pork fat. i started with their <mark>Insalata Caprese</mark> ($21 - candied tomatoes, burrata, and basil), but i wish they put a slice of fresh tomatoes instead. the burrata on the other hand was perfect!\n\nmy entree was an appetizer portion size of a vegetarian version of their pappardelle ($22, but for main course add $37), which took me about 10 bites to eat. i was glad to have some mushroom pieces with each bite. great dish, but the top the dish seemed a little dry, possibly from sitting under the warmer a little too long.\n\nand you can't forget about their wine. they have a ton of wine selections. we ordered 2 red wines, the la mozza \"aragone\" 2006 and the primitivo, primaterra 2009. they really know their stuff here. overall, a+++++ customer service, wine list, and their porter house steak.", 
            "we've been eyeing up this restaurant for months. my husbands birthday was the perfect excuse to partake in colossal proportions. i had  reservations, but once we got there we knew it wasn't necessary, the place was empty except for one other table. the hostess was friendly and assisted us quickly. the tables filled as the night progressed but having the waiters undivided attention was worth getting there early (6:30pm). i was unsure of the wine i wanted, so he patiently went through the list and brought multiple tastings of wine until i found the one i liked (arizona stronghold tazi). our waiter, micheal, was top notch, he was patient and wasn't put off from all our questions, and even made suggestions. my husband got their specialty farmers market drink which was like an orange mojito. we were presented with 2 bite size fried cheese balls, compliments of the chef, they were good, reminded us of the gold fish snack crackers (lol). we also were given tasty dinner rolls with butter or lardo spreads (we both preferred the butter).\nfor our meals we decided on the <mark>Insalata Caprese</mark>,....wow, how can such simple ingredients taste so good? the tomatoes were candied, the mozzarella was fresh, soft and gooey, everything went perfectly together, i could eat that dish everyday.\nnext we got potato gnocchi bolognese and bucatini all' amatriciana, both were delicious. the gnocchi was so tender and the sauce was perfect. the bucatini dish has a little spice to it, the pasta had nice tooth to it, really thick, the pork that was in the sauce totally put the taste into another dimension...simply amazing.\nbeing a steakhouse we had to get beef, we agreed on the dry aged bone in ribeye for 2 with a side of mascarpone & guanciale mashed potatoes and a giant madagascar shrimp. paired with an italian red brandini. the monstrous piece of meat was presented to us, then the waiter carefully cut it into beautiful slices, the bone is left at the table and we were encouraged to have at it (my kind of place), my husband and i had to arm wrestle for the bone:) the steak was so tender, cooked perfectly, seasoning was simple and didn't overpower the meat. the wine complimented the steak perfectly. the mashed potatoes were yummy, very heavy though, so we tried no to eat too much of those. the shrimp was giant as advertised, cooked perfect, taste was delicious, a shrimp that eats like a lobster but better. \nby this point i thought my stomach would explode, but we decided to end the meal with a trio of gelato...vanilla, mint, and espresso; vanilla was the best, the mint made my stomach feel better and actually made me feel like i could eat more, the espresso helped wake me up from my food coma. i was wrong to think we were done, our waiter brought 2 complimentary raisin cookies, i had to eat it, reminded me of biscotti.\nthe food is pricey but i think it was worth every penny and would go back in an instant, you can even eat at the bar if you wish to just pop in for a taste.", 
            "honestly over rated!\n\ni have been meaning to try carne vino since i'm a huge fan of osteria mozza & pizzeria mozza. i came with a big appetite and great foodie friends. i had the dry aged bone-in ribeye(serves 2), by myself. yes, i eat a lot. but not because i wanted to gorge myself with tons of meat... ok maybe. but i also sampled the bone in ny strip and filet. i must say that the filet and strip were much better cuts compared to the ribeye. this is coming from someone who loves ribeyes, bone-in none the less!!! definitely not worth the price. \n\nsome noteworthy side dishes include:\n\nbeef cheek ravioli, <mark>Insalata Caprese</mark> & seasoned black truffle pasta. \n\ni would highly recommend trying your choice of the strip or filet and spend money on a great wine to pair. i'm a fan of their vino, but the carne, not so much.", 
            "visited carnevino with two business associates last night. i had very high expectations going in, given that this is a mario batali establishment, and quite frankly for the price, i was disappointed. the restaurant was beautiful, but the music was waaaaay too loud! the entire night, i had led zeppelin, u2 and some other weird junk blasting in my ears. i love classic rock, but i found this very out of character with the restaurant. not sure mario would have approved that music choice. the waiter and wait staff were excellent. very attentive without being overbearing. allowed us to move along at our own pace. we never felt rushed. the wine list was extensive, and exhaustive to read. their focus is obviously on imported wines, primarily italian, which fits with the theme of the restaurant. great selection, vegas prices, what can i say?! the food was a mixed bag. bread (buns?) came with a salted butter, and some gelatinous pork fat spread. it was no pork rillette, for sure. it tasted like flavored lard. as for antipasto, i had the <mark>Insalata Caprese</mark>. it was nothing like the pictures you see on the web site here. obviously getting fresh tomatoes in vegas in february must be a challenge, but this had 4 slices of like re-hydrated sun dried tomatoes with a pesto sauce with some very mild white cheese. where is the buffalo mozzarella? where are the heirloom tomatoes. very disappointing. one of may associates had the caesar salad and didn't finish it. we also tried the beef cheek ravioli's. very good, especially with the aged balsamic as a kicker. now for the main attraction, the meats. these wee 3 of the finest cuts of meat i have ever seen. i had the 16 oz bone in new york. wow!!!!! cooked to perfection, beautifully seasoned, and tasted incredible. another associate had the 8 oz filet. again, a superb piece of meat. i think he licked the plate!!! however, the main attraction were the <mark>Lamb Chops</mark>. three of the biggest (they are double cut), juiciest and most perfectly cooked chops i have ever seen. the flavor was beyond words. the chops were a work of art! so large though that my associate could not finish it all. we also had the fries as a side dish. pass on those. soft, soggy and drenched in oil. yuck! \n\ni would recommend carnvino for the meats. they are spectacular. as for everything else, they were very mediocre to poor. as a restaurant owner, i was a little disturbed by the quality and consistency of the experience given the steep price tag you pay.", 
            "just had lunch at carnevino...sat at the bar. ordered the <mark>Insalata Caprese</mark> and the beef cheek ravioli (off menu). both were just decent, especially considering the price...i mean, $31 for a lunch portion of ~7 ravioli is a bit ridiculous, and i live in a high cost area and rarely experience \"sticker shock\". service, however, was impeccable.", 
            "items selected:\npeach bellini\ngougeres with gorgonzola\nrosemary rolls with lardo and salted butter\n<mark>Grilled Octopus</mark> with pickled vegetables and limoncello\n<mark>Insalata Caprese</mark> with burrata and basil\nbruschetta di stracciatella with charred summer squash\n<mark>Carne Cruda</mark> alla piemontese - chopped to order steak tartare\n<mark>Tagliata di Manzo</mark> with bbl beef, arugula, parmigiano\nbeef cheek ravioli with aceto balsamico\ngnocchi with summer vegetable ragu\nricotta and egg raviolo with brown butter\n\"creamed\" corn with <mark>Chopped Pickled Peppers</mark>\nsauteed mixed mushrooms with spring onions\nfried eggplant with tomato & ricotta\nmascarpone & guanciale mashed potatoes\ncider and salt brined 20oz bone-in <mark>Pork Chop</mark>\n240+ day dry aged 2.5\" riserva porterhouse\n240+ day dry aged 2\" riserva <mark>Bone-In New York Strip</mark>\n90+ day dry aged bone-in ribeye\n90+ day dry aged fiorentina\n<mark>Gorgonzola Mascarpone</mark> sauce\nchocolate & peanut butter torte with peanut brittle, salted caramel\ncannoli - pistachio brittle, chocolate chip ricotta\nchocolate cake with bing cherries and candied pecans\npumpkin spice gelato\npear, melon, pink lady apple sorbet\nvanilla bean gelato afogatto\n\n\nin a town where \"whales,\" \"ballers,\" and \"high rollers\" command comps at many top-tables it should come as no surprise that the opportunity to indulge on exotic ingredients is available to those willing to pay, yet when it comes to sin city's very best beef the question becomes even more complicated - an answer involving not just cash, but time.  known by the term 'riserva' and nowhere present on the restaurant menu our eight-top's 240+ day dry-aged steak experience actually began years prior with selective sourcing, breeding, feeding, butchery, as well as storage - an aged bacteria direct from italy driving the latter - and with each stage described at length throughout the course of a 3.5 hour meal that entailed no less than twenty other outstanding plates plus far too many drinks it can only be said that nothing could have prepared us for the meal's apex, four different steaks plus a chop offering an education in things few will ever have the opportunity to taste.  having already visited carnevino twice, with wowed results each time, it seems almost a crime to gloss over items like a textbook bellini thick with white peach or tartare so tender it simply dissolved on the tongue but with all apologies to tender pastas including the famous beef cheek ravioli as well as the \"super chicken\" egg raviolo suffice it to say that only a single side of mushrooms was less than exemplary...but not a one of them could match the meats, the younger steaks and chop easily on par with those from last year while the riserva was almost unimaginably tender with a flavor profile that ranged from walnuts to stilton to truffles as a buttery basenote lingered in each bite.   undoubtedly a big budget event in a space not unaccustomed to such things it was finally with a table of desserts followed by a small plate of cookies that the evening would end and visited by head chef nicole brisson before our departure each of us said our thanks - an invite to tour the aging facility something i look forward to doing soon and a return visit already in the planning stages for when my friends are next in town.\n\nconsidered by some, including myself, to be the best steakhouse in the country even before this meal suffice it to say that carnevino upped the stakes (and steaks) for all future meals here in las vegas - the private room, the exquisite services, the specially requested soundtrack of pearl jam's ten played throughout the restaurant, more than a handful of 'gifts' joining each course, and especially the riserva all making a special meal truly world class."

            "glad we came back for another \"snack\" that ended up being dinner!\n\nagain, we ended up in the bar and shared a tasty bottle of chianti.  i was surprised, honestly, at how few chiantis were on the menu.  there were tons of super tuscans and other varieties, but maybe only 5 chiantis.  weird.  \n\nanyhow, on to the food:\n-we were given warm rosemary focaccia bread with a salty butter mousse as well as a 'lardo' mousse.  the lardo is made from curing strips of pig fat with rosemary and is quite rich; it is a nice addition to the hearty bread, but definitely in moderation!\n-started with the <mark>Affettati Misti</mark> (meat plate, basically) and the  house cured pastrami.  the meat plate was decent, but nothing to write home about.  i wouldn't order it again.  however, the pastrami blew me away!  it was thick, peppery, and so good!  it came with a small salad of frisee with a wonderful duck egg on the top.  the flavors came together so well.  yum!\n-with the pastas, they are served as 'appetizer' style, so they're perfect for sharing.  however, you can order any one as a diner portion for 15 bucks more.  we shared the bucatini amatriciana, which is still the best one i've tasted outside of rome, and the surprisingly amazing ravioli di stracotto (duck livers with aged balsamic vinegar). the ravioli was to die for! i wanted to order three more dishes of it!  \n\noverall, i was very pleased with our food and wine, which was served in these beautifully tall glasses.  i will return during my next trip!  do yourself a favor and try it out!", 
            "i am so damn broke.  damn you mario batali & joseph bastianich.\n\nwe stayed at the palazzo so we figured... we might as well choose a restaurant within the property and finally decided on carnevino.  the restaurant itself is pretty big and we were brought all the way to the back, which was nice since it wasn't as loud as the main dining room and the high ceiling definitely makes it a nicer place to dine at.\n\nafter looking through the menu, the server somehow convinced us to go the \"family-style\" way, which is priced at a minimum of $100 per person but he would have the chefs prepare the top dishes in each course to share: 5 appetizers, 4 pastas, and 5 different cuts of meat.  he also guaranteed that we would not go hungry even though it was 9 guys.  \n\nit ended up as one of the most expensive meals but pretty legit.  they started out by bringing rosemary infused bread that everybody gets with 2 kinds of spread: housemade butter and flavored pork back fat.  yes, pork back fat, aka lard.  don't be scared cause it was amazing haha.\n\n for appetizers, they brought out:\n\n1. <mark>Insalata Caprese</mark> - amazing caprese salad with thick slices of heirloom tomatoes and a mozarella & cream combo called burrata.\n2. <mark>Grilled Octopus</mark> - freaking amazing.  i never had octopus that tender and the limoncello reduction over it was genius.  \n3. <mark>Fried Calamari</mark> - common item... but damn when it is done this well, i don't want it anywhere else. \n4. hanger steak carpaccio - special of the night and pretty much a pile of arugula with a delicious steak carpaccio underneath and over it.\n5. <mark>Affettati Misti</mark> - selection of house cured meats with a variety of grilled peppers.  the pork belly seriously just melts in your mouth.\n6. grilled foie gras - umm..... yes yes yes.  i think they drizzled a balsamic reduction over it too.  crap.. i'm seriously drooling right now.\n\nas for the pastas, each dish are all appetizer servings but if you want, you can add $15 more to make it into entree size.  all the pasta dishes are much more about the ingredients.  they brought out:\n\n1. potato gnocchi bolognese - just.. really really solid gnocchi with a really good bolognese.  wish there was more bolognese though.\n2. puttanesca - olives, capers, and anchovies with penne.  simple but so good.\n3. beef cheek ravioli - beef cheek = one of the most tender cut of meat ever and they even drizzle aged real balsamic over it.  yea.  heaven.\n4. black truffle pasta - when this came out, i was just... at a loss for words since it had real shaved slices of black truffle all over it rather than the typical truffle oil you see at many places.  the spaghetti itself with made with extra yolk too so the texture was amazing.  favorite out of all.\n\nfor the meats, they bring it all out and they carve it off the bone right in front of you:\n\n1. veal chop - tender, perfectly done.  the bone-in probably gave it extra flavor.\n2. dry-aged bone-in ribeye - i love the seasoning and the crust.  italian seasoned steaks is just good eating.  i still think gallagher's dry-age beef is better though!\n3. <mark>Lamb Chops</mark> - ok this was the best lamb i've had.  i'm not a big fan of lamb because of the gaminess, but somehow it's all good and it is absolutely amazing.  \n4. <mark>Pork Chop</mark> - done medium well, and the way it is brined gives what seems like a really boring piece of pork good flavors.\n5. maine lobster tail - they only brought out one so it was kinda hard to share among all of us but... it was buttery goodness!  hahah.\n\nthey also brought out two sides: mashed potatoes with marscapone & guanciale (type of unsalted bacon) with raw egg yolk mixed in, and sauteed mushrooms & onions.  both were perfect as side dishes.\n\nat first we were afraid that we weren't gonna get full since the appetizer and pastas' portions were not big at all but after everything, we couldn't finish all the protein and it ended up being the perfect late night snack after xs :p\n\nif you come with a big group, definitely think about getting the \"family-style\" since you'll get to truly taste what carnevino is all about.  just expected to drop... quite a bit of money especially if you order wine and after the 20% gratuity charge.", 
            "i am really baffled by all the hate for carnevino in the reviews. i first came here about 5 years ago when i cam to vacation in las vegas and have been back probably 10-15 times since i moved to las vegas. i always go when people are in from out of town and want a good steak place so i have been with about 20-30 different people. never have any of us gotten a bad item, had bad service, or not loved it. i am a unapologetic fine dining snob and until gordon ramsay steak opened this was my favorite steak restaurant in vegas- and for the steak itself it is probably slightly better than grk (grk has better non steak dishes and desserts). i can't wait for someone else to visit so i can try the new beef tasting menu. \n\nthe restaurant comes from mario batali (orange crocs) and joe bastianich (the mean judge on amster chef). if you have been to any of their other restaurants carnevino is similar in many regards- formal fine dining atmosphere, similar slowly paced service, the waitstaff likes to talk etc. this isn't for everyone- some people just want to order their food and have it delivered in less than 10 minutes without a lecture on italian after dinner drinks (grappa by the way is an acquired taste- i almost gagged the first time i had it but now i love it). if you do go to carnevino give yourself at least two hours and have a backup liver waiting for transplant. \n\nthe steaks\nusually i would start with appetizers but let's be honest- you are here for a giant slab of meat. \n\n here are the steaks i have had ranked in order\n\n1. bone in ribeye for two. this is carved tableside. if you like ruths chris serve your steak at 1500 degrees sizzling deal you might not like this as it is served more room temperature- and if it is warm at all the heat quickly goes away from the thinly sliced meat. it is very tasty though- the seasoning is very light so its all beef taste.\n2. ny strip- not usually one of my favorite cuts but i have gotten it a few times for variety and it is better here than elsewhere i have had it.\n3. bone in filet- superior to the boneless imo- has the very soft texture and less beefy taste you expect from a filet. \n\nnow, not always, but most of the time, they have a special steak that is aged longer- if this is available for the love of all that is holy get it. pay whatever they ask- 100$ a pound, 200$ a pound, your first born- whatever it takes. these steaks taste like nothing you have ever had or likely will have again in the future. they have an almost blue cheese like flavor that is incredible. i have had plenty of expensive food that i would say was not worth it- this is not one of those. \n\nnon steak items- i have ordered a few of these - <mark>Pork Chop</mark>, osso buco, and they are great- if you are a local and can come here frequently i highly encourage you to try them. if you are in from out of town though, you probably just want to get a steak or you will return him and find yourself lying awake in bed, filled with regrets.\n\nappetizers- there are quite a few beef appetizers. you can go two ways with this- some people will find beef on beef on beef to be too much- we call them french. so if you are worried about your blood test results get something else, if you love america here are some suggested apps (not all of these are beef but are meat)\n\n\n1. <mark>Carne Cruda</mark>- raw beef good. \n\n2.prosciutto di parma and <mark>Affettati Misti</mark>- picking between these two is slightly harder than sophie's choice\n\n3. beef cappallacci -this has some really strong goat cheese which is amazing but may knock your socks off. \n\n4. anolini- lobster pasta- whats not to love", 
            "items selected:\ncheese bombolini\nrosemary focaccia with lardo and butter\nstracciatella - beets, citrus, sicilian pistachios \nhouse-made pastrami - duck egg, cracked pepper\n<mark>Grilled Octopus</mark> - pickled vegetables and limoncello\nprosciutto di parma 'riserva' - apples, puffed bread\n<mark>Carne Cruda</mark> - chopped to order steak tartare with raw mushrooms, fennel\n<mark>Affettati Misti</mark> - mortadella, lomo, coppa, fennel salami, head cheese, jingle bell and piquillo peppers\ngnocchi - gorgonzola, arugula and figs\nbeef cheek ravioli - white truffles, brown butter\n2\" 240+ day dry aged riserva strip\n90-day bone in ribeye\nveal chop - 20oz bone in\ncharred brussel sprouts with gremolata\nfried eggplant with tomato & ricotta\nmascarpone & guanciale mashed potatoes\nspinach with garlic & hot peppers\ncesare's '<mark>Tuscan Fries</mark>'\nchocolate & peanut butter torte - peanut brittle, salted caramel\nvanilla cheesecake - pomegranate, roast apples\ncaramel panna cotta - vanilla poached pears, candied pecans\nvanilla semifreddo - citrus, caramel sauce\ndouble espresso over ice\n\nattempting to craft a memorable las vegas weekend for an old friend who has been everywhere and eaten almost everything it was to nicole brisson and the staff at carnevino that my mind turned when looking for something 'unique,' and two weeks following a tour of the aging facility on dean martin with the chef and her team a group of six sat down in the grand dining room for an $1100 meal crafted by chef brisson and head server, shep, the man who'd arranged the tour and easily one of the city's best front of house staff.\n\nhigh ceilinged and energetic as ever, with batali's eclectic mix of rock playing just-loud-enough overhead, it was in two bottles of affordable wine that the group partook (after cracking some jokes about the general absurdity of the list) and placing ourselves in the hands of the restaurant a four-course feast unfolded, the opening volley of creamy gougeres proving as good as ever while lardo and butter gilded many rosemary rolls.\n\nmoving onward to antipasta, as the white stripes churned overhead, a six-pack of plates began the meal proper and with stretchy stracciatella, tender tartare, and prosciutto as well as house made charcuterie all shining strongly none of them could trump mario's signature charred octopus splashed in spice and acid, nor the off-menu reference standard pastrami served with two sunny side duck eggs - a plate that left us mopping the plate clean and requesting more bread.\n\nnext offered a pair of primi, the $80 white truffle supplement added to signature beef-cheek ravioli proving a pricey and unimpressive upcharge that was additionally unrequested, it was additionally interesting that the tender gnocchi saw only one slice of fig offered with one plate while a trio graced the other - a skimpy portion either way, considering the cost of the four pastas alone trumped $180 inclusive of tax and tip.\n\nmoving onward to the main event, a trio of meats that were hand selected by shep and the chef, suffice it to say that the grill is where carnevino again showed its 'stuff' and with several calling the olive-oil drizzled veal chop the best they'd ever tasted it was straight to the steaks that other's attention turned - the sizable 90+ day dry-aged ribeye every bit deserving its signature status while a 2\" strip, aged nearly 9 months, was supple and aromatic - the top notes of truffle melting to flavors of beef and butter and ending with a blue cheese linger unlike any other steak on the market.\n\nimpressed somewhat by sides, mostly by the potatoes and eggplant but less so by spinach that was lost amidst bold spice and garlic, it was with a double espresso refresher that the palate was transitioned to dessert and although the signature bombolini were not served this time around there was a different favorite for everyone at the table amongst the four items served - the crispy chocolate and peanut butter torte as good as ever while both the winter citrus semifreddo and delicate cheesecake were exercises in refinement, each presenting bold flavors amidst light textures and perfectly suited to end a meal so heavily invested in meat.\n\nnot quite as impressive as my last two visits to carnevino, largely as a result of the exceedingly disappointing and pricey pastas, the restaurant still stands as one of the most unique experiences in las vegas and although the riserva is indeed a pricey piece of meat, the care and effort involved cannot be overstated as everything from sourcing and selection to aging and presentation is unquestionably world class."

            "unlike some of the reviewers, i found the ambience of the restaurant enjoyable and relaxing.  i think that perhaps the disparity between reviewers loving or hating the ambience comes down to which side of the restaurant you are seated in.   the retaurant is split in two, bookends to an escalator to the skywalk to the wynn resort.  there appears to be a pathway behind the escalators to go between the sides.   the people who sit in the main area where the bar and entrance are located in is nice and relaxing whereas the other side of the restaurant seems more likely to get the casino noise.  the music in the restaurant is a little too loud as well.\n\nthe service we had was excellent.  i'd give a 5 star if a review was based on service alone.  \n\nthe food is where my star rating fell dramatically.   we started with <mark>Fried Calamari</mark> which was excellent.  next course was two pastas - black fettucine (made with squid ink) with dungeness crab and a pasta with lamb ragu.  the black fettucine  was ok but a bit tastless although the pasta with lamb ragu was quite good.  \n\nfor entrees, the osso bucco was good but the veal saltimbocca was ridulously salty and inedible.    it was the equivilent of opening a salt shaker and pouring it into your mouth.    veal saltimbocca is one of my favorites italian dishes and i couldn't wait to taste mario batali's version.   this was a huge disappointment.\n\nthe wine list, which i was looking forward to ordering from, had hundreds of wines.  it's an extensive list however the prices were too high.  we decided to forego the wine and go for cocktails instead.\n\nsorry mario but i won't be back.", 
            "went here for my 22nd birthday dinner with four friends. we were excited for a night of las vegas's magical cuisine. this place really delivers!\n\nthe waiter were so knowledgeable about everything being placed on the table, in or around us. it almost became to much, when explaining specials, their presentation, and suggestions they were very long winded. i guess i felt like when deep in conversation with close friends, give us some space. but really, i'd rather have a wait staff over doing it than under doing it, so i can't complain too much.\n\nthe restaurant is huge with really expensive looking art and furniture. dark toned brown leathers it felt grand. deep red paint covered most of the walls and creme linens lined the tables. i felt comfortable with the table set up and comfy chairs. it was exactly how i imagined dinner with tony soprano would be like. this italian steakhouse made sparks fly for me. \n\nfor entrees i got the beef carpaccio and the <mark>Fried Calamari</mark>. everyone enjoyed those tasty dishes. i ordered the <mark>Filet Mignon</mark>, the waiter said it was hormone and antibiotic free, sounds even better i'll take it. when my filet finally came out i was starving, i didn't wanna fill up too much on the super bread! oh heaven's me, i was on cloud nine. it was perfectly seasoned with their own blend of sea salt, pepper, and rosemary. i will always come back.", 
            "came here with a friend during lunch time, while visiting vegas. upon entering, the place looks huge and the giant bull statue by the entrance really gives this place some presence. the architecture and decor is similar to that of an italian banquet hall, a room with high ceilings and doors to match. this was in the late afternoon and around that time i went the sun floods the room just right giving you a great lighting of the entire area. to be honest the feel, look and atmosphere seemed like i was actually in italy. ok on to the food.\n\nthis place has a set menu for lunch and a set menu for dinner and both are different from each other. the lunch menu didn't look very tasty at all and it didn't offer any steaks listed from the dinner menu and we both had our stomachs set for steak. my friend and i asked if we could order something from the dinner menu, but the waiter was a bit reluctant but would ask the chef if we could. luckily, we arrived at a time when business was very very slow, where my friend and i are the only one there for lunch. the waiter came back and said the chef would cook it if we don't mind waiting 35-45 mins. to bring the frozen dry-aged bone in ribeye to room temperature for cooking. we were more than happy to wait for their signature steak, which can only be ordered by 2 people (lucky us).\n\nalong with the bone in ribeye we also ordered a plate of <mark>Fried Calamari</mark>. we were also asked by the waiter if we wanted to add a sauce for our steak, something to compliment it with. however, our waiter said you shouldn't bother, the steak is seasoned perfectly and tastes better w/o any of carnevino's sauces. rather friendly advice if you ask me and so we saved ourselves $5 from a sauce.\n\nthe calamari was cooked perfectly, although it was rather small in terms of size, moderate in terms of portion and reasonably high in term of price. ok as for the ribeye. omg! that was perhaps the best bone in ribeye i have ever tasted. it's huge, which explains why it is meant for 2 people. they cut that slab of meat off of the bone right next to you and serves it on your plate. they also leave the bone with any left over meat for you to gnaw at it like the flintstones. between my friend and myself i'm usually the eater, however, this time around i had to make my friend eat the rest of the meat. the waiter was correct about the ribeye being seasoned perfectly. the salt and pepper used to season the ribeye was more than enough and it left a very nice, slightly crunchy crust to the outside of the meat. no matter what the beef of this place is worth the money. didn't have any wine though. didn't feel i needed to add any more to the bill. besides the steak was more than enough. i must have had an off-day in terms of eating. i really wanted to gnaw at the bits of meat on the bone. expect to spend alot, your not only purchasing the beef, but paying for the ambiance.",

            "loved, loved, loved  carnevino!\n\nevery time my fianc\\u00e9 and i take a trip to vegas we have at least 1 nice/romantic dinner that's different from the buffet and cafe dining. during our recent labor day trip we chose to eat at carnevino.  there were so many restaurants on our list but this was recommended by a friend so we decided to give it a try and i'm glad we did!\n\ntrue, this place is a bit on the pricey side but you get what you pay for. from the moment you walk in, you feel different. classy. elegant. important.  our waiter was well spoken, offered nice recommendations, and humorous. i give their service 5 stars.\n\nwe started the evening with a magnum bottle of champagne. yes, magnum. a regular bottle just wasn't enough. haha\n\n-------------------------\nhere's what we ordered:\n\n* appetizer\n<mark>Fried Calamari</mark> = 5 stars\nmarinara and pickled hot peppers\n\n* entree\nveal scaloppine = 4 stars\nporcini and marsala\n\n<mark>Filet Mignon</mark> = 5 stars\n\n* sides\nmascarpone & guanciale mashed potatoes = 5 stars\n\nsauteed mixed mushrooms with spring onion = 4 stars\n\n* dessert\nmarket napoleon tart = 5 stars\nricotta cream & candied pistachios\n-------------------------\n\nmy favorite part of the meal was the mashed potatoes and i'm always about the meat, or so i thought.  they break a poached egg into the mashed potatoes upon serving. it was absolutely divine!\n\ni ordered the <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> cooked medium and that's exactly what i got.  i usually get a sauce on top but it doesn't always satisfy so i opted for no sauce and loved it.  the flavor of the meat really came through and the steak was juicy in every bite.\n\nthe sides are ordered \\u00e0 la carte, much like other steakhouses.  they are priced reasonably at $9 each.\n\nthe dessert really surprised me.  it certainly wasn't a contender upon reading the menu, even though i love ricotta.  our waiter highly recommended it and described it with such passion that i could almost taste it. we had to try it!  it is not what you expect in a \"tart\" so you should try for yourself.\n\nour total bill was just under $275 (including tax and gratuity).  it was worth every penny, from the ambiance to the food to the service.", 
            "okay - i hate to do this - but i can only give carnevino a three star rating. now, maybe i just had an off day, since everyone and their mother loves this place, but i did not love my meal. \n\nwe first started off with <mark>Fried Calamari</mark> and potato gnocchi bolognese to share. the calamari was good (not out of this world) and the gnocchis were a bit on the hard side. not what i expected. i am sure they were homemade, however they needed to be cooked just a tad bit more. \n\nfor my meal, i had the <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> and our table shared a number of different sides. as far as the filet is concerned, i asked for it to be medium rare and it was just plain old rare. so rare that i couldn't really eat it. i should have sent it back to be cooked a bit longer (my fault), however i didn't want to be \"that\" girl at the table. \n\nas far as the sides are concerned, the <mark>Fregula, Pecorino Romano, Butternut Squash</mark> dish was delicious. the spinach was a bit on the salty side. the mushrooms were a bit overcooked, they were just a little bit too crispy. \n\nthe dessert however was very good. we had the lemon cheesecake, assorted cookies, butter cream crepes and something else that i can't remember. my favorite would have to be the assorted cookies.\n\nas far as the staff is concerned, everyone was extremely friendly and attentive.", 
            "the first time i went to carnevino (last year) it was one of the best meals i've ever had. this time around the experience fell short.\n\nto start we ordered the <mark>Fried Calamari</mark> and the big eye tuna crudo. the calamari was excellent and the hot peppers in the dish added a good amount of heat without dominating the flavor. the tuna came with approximately eight small slices and were arranged in order of leanest to fattiest. all were delicious, especially the fatty ones. just don't expect large chunks of fish to come out if you order this dish.\n\nnext up was the black fettucine. served as a small portion, this is meant to be the equivalent of an appetizer. it sounded good when our waiter recommended it, because it came with crab, jalape\\u00f1os, and shallots. but the dish just didn't deliver. there wasn't much crab to speak of and the taste and overly-firm texture of the pasta was a turn off.\n\nfor our entrees, both couples ordered the dry aged bone-in ribeye for two. at $65 per person, it wasn't cheap but if was more than enough meat for all of us. they wheel it out on a cart and slice it tableside. the dish is finished with a touch of sea salt and olive oil. our ribeye was a slightly bloody medium rare as we ordered and absolutely delicious. they also leave the bone on the table which was one of the best parts of the meal. i wasn't going to be shy about trying it either. i picked it up and gnawed on it for a while, cleaning off all the meat i could. and, i have to say that the meat from the bone was the most flavorful and memorable bites of the night. as good as that steak was however, i prefer the ribeye at cut to this one. not only is it cheaper (per person), but the smaller and thinner cut of beef allowed for more seasoning and more of the crust on each bite.\n\nour sides were the sauteed mixed mushrooms with spring onions, brussels sprouts with pancetta, and a <mark>Fregula, Pecorino Romano, Butternut Squash</mark> dish with pine nuts and capers. all were amazing and the brussels sprouts were some of the best i've ever had.\n\nso, while i still think carnevino is an excellent restaurant, i would recommend it for the appetizers and sides (you can't go wrong with any of the ones we tried) but the pastas can be hit or miss. their <mark>Filet Mignon</mark>, which i had my previous visit, is amazing and still ranks as the best filet i've ever had. i'm still tempted to go back and try their porterhouse for two or their riserva steak -- aged for over a year.\n\n4.5 stars", 
            "i always hear about carnevino and we finally got a chance to try it.  hostess was great, adjusted our table and sat us right away.  the restaurant has a nice atmosphere.  a huge window towards the back to overlook the strip.  in the middle of the room is a large wine table.  \n\nfor appetizers we ordered:\n**<mark>Carne Cruda</mark> alla piemontese\nchopped to order steak tartare with raw mushrooms.\n--my friend loves this dish,  for me, it was ok.  i don't eat raw beef that often unless i'm in canada, but this was ok.  not too memorable for me.\n**<mark>Grilled Octopus</mark>\npickled vegetables and limoncello\n--this dish was my favorite.  the minute you bite into it there's a shot of flavor that goes into your mouth.  \n**<mark>Fried Calamari</mark>\nmarinara and pickled hot peppers\n--you can never go wrong with <mark>Fried Calamari</mark>\n\nfor the entrees we ordered:\n**black fettucine\ncrab, jalapenos, and shallots\n--i've never seen black fettucine and i tried a bit from my friend's plate.  it was very flavorful.  i definitely want to go back and try a full plate\n**tortelloni\nlobster and tarragon\n--this was a delicious dish as well.  this and the black fettucine itself would be a reason for me to come back\n**dry aged bone in ribeye (medium rare)\n--this thing is huge.  they first show you as a whole, and then cut it table side.  they put the bone on the side and explain that it's the meat is very sweet on the bone\n**<mark>Filet Mignon</mark>\n--you're typical <mark>Filet Mignon</mark>\n\nfor our sides we ordered:\n**roasted beets with pistachios and gorgonzola\n**sauteed brussels sprouts with pancetta\n**roasted shiitakes with aceto balsamico\n**italian broccoli with house smoked pork \n\nall the sides were delicious and complimented what we ordered.  \n\ndessert:  \n**sorbetti:  quince, blood orange, pear\n--i loved all 3 flavors.  quince tasted a little like apple sauce, blood orange and pear was just refreshing after a heavy meal\n\nso overall the food was great, service.....well that could've used some improvement.  we had to wave down the server a few times, which didn't make me happy.  when he first approached our table to take our order, one of my friends asked him a question and he excused himself and didn't come back for a while.  later on, when we asked for our bill (after waving him down again) my friends brought it to his attention that they had made it clear it was my birthday when they made the reservations.  we also noticed that one of my friends didn't get the 'vanilla bean affogato' he ordered.  instead it appeared the waiter ordered an americano.  the waiter tried to rectify the situation by bringing out a dark chocolate cake w/ vanilla huckleberries + a candle.  the dessert was delicious, but sort of ruined my refreshing dessert i had ordered previously.  \n\nas my friend duke says, bad service i can tolerate, but i can't tolerate bad food.   so carnevino, you're lucky your food is oh so good lol.  i will be returning to try the black fettucine + tortellini.", 
            "really a 3.5 star at most, overall\n\ncame here with some friends/couples for a valentines dinner. i did research the reviews on this place and was a bit discouraged to find that it had 3.5 stars with over 240 reviews. i do understand that there are other high caliber steak houses in town that must be taken in consideration when critiquing a place like this. well, i need to find out myself!\n\nthe lowdown on food:\n\ncheese croquettes: complimentary bite sized balls with a lightly fried breaded crust and a mild salty/cheesy filling. not bad, others thought it was good and salty for the most part.\n\nciabatta square bread with \"lardo\" spread (pork fat) and unsalted butter. bread was ok. the lardo spread was pretty good just the thought brought so much guilt! the plain butter was fine and surprisingly tasty.\n\n<mark>Fried Calamari</mark>: small delicately breaded squid on a thin layer of marinara and pickled hot peppers. not chewy and had a oceany flavor to it. not much bang for the buck ($19)\n\nroasted cauliflower with pine nuts, capers and peperonata: it was definitely roasted and nothing extraordinary. i think they forgot to add in the capers too.. didn't see any and didn't taste any?\n\n* i'm only giving them the benefit of the doubt because of the 2 following orders i'm about to mention:\n\n1. dry aged bone-in ribeye: served for 2, approximately 32 ounces and cost a whopping $130! \"bbl is often beyond regular usda prime standards for marbling and flavor\". claimed to be all natural, hand selected, aged in house and rubbed with only sea salt, black pepper and fresh rosemary.\n\n- i'm giving this place the 4 star advantage because the steak was irresistible!! i got it cooked medium well, slight pink through the middle of the thin slices (cut tableside) and a little char on the crust. came with a massive bone (like a foot and quarter long and around 2 inches in diameter!) and server says \"the best part of the steak, go ahead and nibble on it!\" i also had their \"first batch extra virgin olive oil\" drizzled around one side of my plate to wipe my meat slices as i pleased. plus, i ordered a side of bearnaise sauce for dipping. the steak was very tender and their custom dull \"carnevino stamped steak knife\" sliced through it with ease. the simplicity of the few seasonings were light and sensitively used but exactly how a piece of real quality meat should be treated/seasoned!! no ifs, ands or buts, top 3 steaks i've had in my life!! it didn't need anything to support the flavors but i did try dipping a few pieces in the bearnaise and it was absurd how much better it tasted!!  my friend next to me ordered the bearnaise with crab mixed in it. i took a scoop with a chunk of creamy crab, it had nice delicate flavors and it transformed the steak into something positively different.. all in all, this came with  with a heavy weight  price and probably not worth it too most.. but it really was iron chef/mario batali worthy!!!\n\n2. signature mashed potato with poached egg and bacon: oh so smooth, soft textured mash with strips of lightly crisped bacon and an egg on top begging for its yolk to be broken and spread through the little iron dish it was served in. sinfully delicious!! only complaint, it was too small!!\n\n* service: one of the worse service i had ever experienced! many mistakes and amateur decisions such as forgetting to ask everybody what beverage they wanted, extremely long wait with no updates, had to be reminded to serve another soda, hostess and staff member was lacking knowledge of menu items.... \n\nfor the price they should of fed us and wiped our a&%!!!!! on the other hand, the place was quite nice, had a somewhat royal feel to it and i really liked the chinese style \"lazy susan\" embedded in their huge round table (convenient  to share the appetizers, sides and such). lastly, the bone in ribeye was one of the best i've had and the signature mashed potato with egg was drop dead delicious!!", 
            "service - couldn't be better\natmosphere - posh\nfood - excellent\n\nour party of ten had their sights set on some serious meat and most of us decided on either the dry aged bone in ribeye or the la fiorentina (florentine porterhouse).\n\nbecause our group was fairly large, the waiter suggested doing a family style dinner and allowing the chef to bring out his recommendations. he asked for our per person budget and said the chef would tailor the dinner to our party. \n\nso much food was served that i lost track of what exactly we had, but based on our tab, below is what i think we ate. all i remember was that the food was truly amazing! \n\nthe porterhouse is the the steak that everyone must try. so flavorful, so buttery, so good. \n\nour menu...\n\n- <mark>Grilled Octopus</mark>\n- <mark>Fried Calamari</mark>\n- cheese balls in a napkin\n- affettati (chef's selection of house cured meats)\n\n- beef cheek ravioli\n- cannoloni\n- gnocchi\n- truffle\n\n- ribeye\n- porterhouse\n- <mark>Lamb Chops</mark>\n- black rossini\n\n- mash potatoes\n- spinach\n- mushroom\n\n- fernet branca -- the waiter recommended this menthol smelling, bitter tasting, alcohol infused after dinner drink. it had a medicinal quality to it and was suppose to be good for our digestion, even curing or at least preventing a possible a hangover.\n\nwe did bring two magnum bottles of our own wine. and, whoa, the corkage fee was an astounding $75 per bottle.\n\nwell...a steak house serving their finest foods omakase style.  i loved it. this is one of the best steakhouses that i've ever been to. the service and presentation were superb. everything from the appetizers to the pastas to the steaks was just fantastic. \n\nthe astronomical price (even for vegas) is the only thing holding it back from a fifth star.", 
            "i had dinner here on a friday night with my wife.  8:30pm seating.\nall i can say considering some of the other good reviews is that we must have hit it a bad night, time and server.  we were seated on time.  place was jumping full.  music was pumping.  restaurant or club?  our bus boy tried to entertain us while our waiter was nowhere to be found.  about 15 minutes later, we'd had a few refills of our water and ordered and received a bottle of wine from the som. when our waiter finally showed up.  he turned out to be particularly annoying like he'd taken a happy pill. \na good laugh was had when the guy who brought our bread and butter described the butter and second dish of salted lard.  we looked at him questioning the lard and he stated he'd never tasted it thinking it was disgusting and questioned why they served it.  his honesty was great and pretty much set the tone for the night.  i tasted it and it's not good.  lard?!?!\nfunny thing, as we were finishing our appetizer of pretty good <mark>Fried Calamari</mark> but, not yet finished, i saw our bus boy walk by with our entrees.  he found somebody to set our table for the entrees and ask if we were finished with the calamari.  the timing and obviousness of all this was unfortunate.  anyway, the two filets we had were good but not great.  i know this is vegas but at $50 an 8oz filet they better be really good. \nthe rest was uneventful and we left convinced we'll not be back.  sorry mario.  kick it up a notch.", 
            "rather than write an actual review, i will share the letter that i wrote to the general manager. hope it's helpful.\n\ncarnevino restaurant\nrichard douglas/general manager\n\ndear mr. douglas,\n\nmy fiance and i decided to try carnevino because one, i love mario batali and two, we enjoy trying new places.  it was also his 39th birthday and i decided to take him somewhere fancy.  i wanted to express my sentiments in writing so that you may get a full understanding of our dining experience.\n\nfirst off, the bar service was awesome.  i had one greyhound and i was tipsy.  thankfully, the bartender gave me a great drink for a great price of $15.  if you want a better variety of patrons, you may consider dropping some of your drink prices.  las vegas being a tourist town, it's hard to enjoy a drink if you are paying through the nose.  not to mention, it's not like he used grey goose, russo-baltique, belvedere or oval.  he used kettle one. sorry, that's not a $15 drink.\n\nwe were excited to try the food since i reviewed the menu prior to making the reservation.  i already knew that we would not be eating steak even though carnevino is a \"steak house\" type restaurant simply because i refuse to pay $72 per person just for rib-eye, when i can get a great steak at maggiano's for a much reasonable price.  plus, my guy and i are not big meat eaters.  before i get to the food aspect of my letter, i wanted to talk about your staff.  we had two waiters:  marco and danielle.  we loved danielle.  she was the type of person you could have sitting at your table like she was an old friend.  her energy and knowledge of food preparation and description of items was awesome.  i felt like we belonged there and she made us feel very welcomed.  then, there was marco.  marco reminded me of those european waiters who has been serving people in fine restaurants for probably over 15 years.  he personally made me feel like i was not good enough to eat at your restaurant.  it's a feeling i have experienced before and it certainly is very disappointing especially when i knew that our dinner would be pricey.  i expected better service and frankly, my fiance felt the same way.  if it weren't for danielle, we would have left upon being seated.\n\nas a starter we ordered the <mark>Fried Calamari</mark> which was amazing.  i also loved the bread and topping options.  i am a little bit of a risk taker, more so than my fiance and i decided on trying the roasted quail.  we enjoyed our vegetable selection of italian broccoli with roast pork,  fried eggplant and the best mashed potatoes we have ever had.  now comes the fun part: the bird.  the quail smelled like wet dog and i tried it, just once.  i was polite and asked danielle to remove it from my table because it actually made me nauseaous.  i am sure that it was cooked the way it should be but the reality is, not everyone has the same palate.  chef's take the kind of thing personally so i assured the manager and everyone else that it was nothing the chef did.  i simply did not want it.  if it was new york pigeon, i would have guessed that instead.  the manager was kind enough to bring me something else even though i was fine with paying for my quail.  we weren't looking for a free meal. \n\ni like it when wait-staff come to your table to check on you but marco coming to our table a total of 9 times in 10 minutes was not needed.  it was as though he was checking to make sure that we had not left without paying.  maybe the fact that my fiance and i are heavily tattooed, one might think that we must not have much money.  afterall, it's not like tattoos are expensive, right?  i must not be employed to be able to wear a bcbg dress, have 70% of my body tattooed and manage to pay a $125 bill without blinking. my mistake.\n\nwe won't be returning.  though we enjoyed the side options of the menu, the food overall was not what we expected.  the atmosphere was nice though you really need to consider a different option for music.  not everyone likes the rolling stones, especially on repeat.  and have a chat with marco about his demeanor.  though i am sure because of his many years of experience as a waiter, he must assume that this equates the same for how you treat people.  i could stoop down to his level and say something like, \"afterall, he is only just a waiter\" but then again, i am above that.  i respect people and respect what people do for a living.  maybe one day, he will have a waiter quite like himself and remember that he serves the public, much like a janitor. \n\nsincerely,\n\nilene huffman\n\np.s.  i find it amusing that some of your staff members have to wear a suit to pour water.  that's a bit much, don't you think?", 
            "happy and fat. \n\nthe operative words that come to mind when i hear the name mario batali. sadly, the overpriced, lackluster fare at carnevino only made me the latter! but, as a disclaimer, it has been quite a while since my visit here, so hopefully they've made some improvements since then. \n\nlocated in the palazzo, carnevino semi-failed from the get-go. while it maintains the top-notch customer service and decadent, chic decor expected of a high-end vegas establishment, the ambience was marred by the raucous sound of beastie boys blarring from the stereo system. i'm not neccessarily opposed to them, but the likes of \"intergalatic\" and \"sabatoge\" didn't jive well with the up-scale environment.  \n\nthe menu was sneaky too. so, watch out! case in point, the prices listed for the pastas range from $17-$31; however, these are for appetizer portions only. an additional $15 needs to be tacked on for the entree size. also, the steak for two is listed as $72, but it's $72 per person, making it a whopping $144.  a steak legitimately worth that much wouldn't be for eating, as it should be plated in precious metals and embedded with swarvoski crystals.\n\nwe ended up ordering the bison carpaccio & <mark>Fried Calamari</mark> appetizers, 16-oz <mark>Bone-In New York Strip</mark>, grilled sweetbreads, & pork milanese. pretty much all the main courses failed, and for an establishment that boasts \"the highest-quality, excellently prepared steaks\" i was seriously expecting more than the the chewy, bland <mark>Bone-In New York Strip</mark> that was served. the appetizers were actually pretty good, and i'd recommend getting the bison capaccio. but other than that, the highlights of the meal were the complimentary cheese puffs & the bread w/butter & peppered lard. \n\nneedless to say, this was a sad way to start out our trip in vegas. luckily, our night of debauchery at xs later on that night made up for it. two stars!", 
            "one of the most unique steakhouses in vegas offering a rare culinary delight:  months aged dry aged beef.\n\nread on, i promise not to talk about what the process really is.\n\ncalled \"riserva\", the once usda prime beef is aged six to 11 months before being trimmed and served.  the result is unlike \"younger\", 30-75 day dry aged beef.  the shorter aged steaks retain a beefy texture, very tender with a pronounced nutty, bleu cheese aroma and flavor with a massive umame finish.  the months aged beef, think prosciutto.  broiled rare to mid rare at a low temperature.  there is no thick outer crust.  the flavor is mild and nutty with only the hint of bleu cheese aroma.  the beef is dense and oily.  it has a very different mouth feel.  it is extremely sweet.  amazing but not for everyone.\n\ntip:  request the \"riserva\" steaks when making reservation.  the amount of aging doesn't matter.  the piece is selected when it has reached the correct characteristics.\n\ntraditional dry aged steaks are excellent.  the rib eye <mark>Italian Broccoli with Garlic and Pork</mark> both possess the classic umame packed dry aged goodness.  excellent sear, tender and juicy.  both steaks are meant to be shared.  if dining alone, both the bone in <mark>Bone-In New York Strip</mark> and bone in <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> offer the same experience as the porterhouse in a more manageable 16oz portion.\n\nall steaks are rubbed with rosemary before cooking.  it imparts a strong, woodsy flavor that enhances the sweetness of the beef.\n\nnot into aged beef?  the 20oz bone in veal chop is excellent.  natural, pasture raised veal, it has a light beef flavor with a soft texture.  it's dry rubbed with thyme <mark>Italian Broccoli with Garlic and Pork</mark> powder that imparts a very flavorful earthy goodness.  a drizzle of fresh olive oil adds the perfect richness.\n\nfor starters, the <mark>Fried Calamari</mark>, \"shrimp alla diavola\", and bucatini amatriciana are excellent but why fill up.  you can get these at batali's italian eatery, b&b ristorante.\n\nthe restaurant captures the spirit of italy, an enjoyable, casual, jovial evening.  don't go with an elegant stick up your, you know.  the bread will make your hands oily and gnawing the bone is encouraged.\n\nbravo!", 
            "the food was really good. we had the <mark>Fried Calamari</mark>--probably the best i've ever eaten. my husband and i split the bone-in ribeye for 2. the medium rare was really rare so make sure and clarify this with the waiter. my husband thought the steak was too salty; i thought it was fine. the sides we had were the mashed potatoes and eggplant. both were superb. we split a tiramisu for dessert. it was delicious. i had a lemony flavor to it. the only drawback was the loud music. if you want a more quiet dining experience, ask to be seated in the wine room. we will do that next time. we went to mix at mandalay bay last night and i would give it 5 stars compared to the 4 for carnevino..",

            "i was staying at the venetian for a work conference and we're going through a late night dry-run with a couple colleagues when we got hungry around 8:30pm. we really wanted some steak and stopped by cut(?) first however their wait was 45 minutes. we called the concierge to see what our other options were for steak with a shorter wait time and she recommended carnevino. so off we went.\n\nthe restaurant itself is located away from restaurant row and through the casino in the palazzo. it had a nice ambiance, dim lighting and quite intimate with racks of their great wine selection on the walls. we grabbed a couple drinks while waiting to be seated and i got a moscow mule which was ok.\n\nonce seated we ordered the <mark>Fried Calamari</mark> which was pretty good. they brought out bread with two sides of butter <mark>Italian Broccoli with Garlic and Pork</mark> fat which they recommended mixing together before spreading it on the bread and oh my god it was delish. i mean pork fat and butter? c'mon. they also gave us complimentary mini bread rolls with cheese inside and it pretty much tasted like a crispy cheese ball which is amazing.\n\na colleague and i ordered the dry aged bone-in ribeye which has the option on menu to split between two for $72 each. we were unsure until our waiter told us this particular dish was in the running for the best steak in the country. so we pretty much were validated in our reasoning for getting it lol. another colleague got the <mark>Bone-In New York Strip</mark>. we also got the charred brussels sprouts and the saut\\u00e9ed mushrooms. \n\nthe waiters (yes, more than one) came and rolled out a table with the bone-in ribeye and holy mother of god was this thing huge. i mean i'm all of 5'1 and it could've knocked me out. they cut the entire dish in front of us and served it neatly sliced on our plates and then placed the bone in the middle of the table. ok time for the big taste...simply put it was the best steak i've ever had in my life. i mean perfectly seasoned and moist and melt in your mouth goodness. after getting over the massive bone just chillin on the table i savored every bite. the brussels sprouts were pretty good but i thought the mushrooms were very good. \n\nin addition i have to say what really gave my review the full five stars was the exceptional service. working in a field that pretty much values service i mean they were very at tentative. they took the time to explain everything to us, make sure we were comfortable, and checked on us regularly - even making sure to fold our napkins of we went to the bathroom. \n\ni had a really great experience here. good food, good company, good service. i left full and satisfied and honestly i would recommend this place if you are looking for a really great steak that you definitely don't mind splurging on.", 
            "very fine italian steakhouse. went with industry collagues and did a 3-course tasting. just... delicious.\n\ncan't tell you everything, but we did have <mark>Fried Calamari</mark>, dry aged beef tortellini, some other pasta and sliced meat with these little bread rolls you wrapped the meat around, and the meat included the chop, dry aged bone-in ribeye, <mark>Filet Mignon</mark>, and dry aged <mark>Bone-In New York Strip</mark>. i'd say the temp came in just a hair over medium-rare, but all in all... fantastic meal.\n\nalso had the chocolate & peanut butter torte for dessert. heaven.\n\nyou won't be disappointed.", 
            "carnevino is the new batali steakhouse in the palazzo (venetian). i had very high expectations for one of my favorite chefs, and as usual, batali did not disappoint! everything about it was great - knowledgeable, efficient, good service; warm inviting decor; and great food and wine! i was in heaven! they gave us each a complimentary cheese puff - so yummy and creamy! i think the cheese was parmesan but i'm not positive... who cares? it was good and that's all that matters!\n\nwe started out with a couple of appetizers - <mark>Fried Calamari</mark> in a light tomato sauce (lightly fried so that the calamari was still supple and tender, and the sauce was a nice complement, not overwhelming) and a fabulous caprese salad (perfectly ripe tomatoes with the creamiest, most buttery mozzarella)... mmm... that was soon followed by two pastas - the oriechette with sweet sausage (one of my faves!) and papperdelle with mushrooms. both were wonderful - perfectly salted pasta with fresh straightforwards ingredients. afterwards we were served with our entrees - most of us had steaks(wonderfully flavored and perfectly cooked). i also tried sweetbreads for the first time - quite good! i can't remember whick malbec we had but it went very well with the entire meal. i finished off the feast with some moscato d'asti. \n\nthe entire evening was simply lovely - great company and great food and wine."

            "this is a mario batali restaurant in vegas' palazzo hotel and casino - it's right across the skybridge from the wynn. we came here for my sister's birthday dinner and left stuffed.\n\nprobably one of the more expensive places i've ever eaten at coming in at little over $100/person for a table of 7. i guess two bottles of $125 wine didn't help the matter =p their somelier was really friendly, though. she did this whole presentation for priming the glasses for our wine by pouring a little into each ginormous sized wine glass and rolling it around to clear it of polish, detergents, etc and to prep the glass with the smell of the wine. did it help? i'll have to try primed/non-primed glasses at home to compare =p i didn't really notice that much of a difference, but i'm not a huge wine snob...\n\nthe restaurant's setting is decent - a sorta steakhouse feel right inside the palazzo - but close enough to casion floor that you can still hear the sounds of slots. one look at the wine list and you sorta remember where you're at - wines from $100 - $5,000. holy crap... haha.\n\nanyways, on our server's suggestion, we shared 2 appetizers with the table and each ordered our own entrees and some sides.\n\ncomplements of the chef:\nfried parmesean balls - just like it sounded... delicious =p on a side note, one of our asian servers came up and pronounced the whole thing in fluent italian. that was trippy... (*psst* did he just speak italian???)\n\nappetizers: \nfresh mozeralla over toasted bread - pretty tasty stuff... but i was surprised when they brought out a huge slab of mozeralla and one tiny piece of bread. when the server described the plate, we thought each person would get a piece of bread... instead it was one regular sized piece of bread - we had to ask the server to cut it into seven for us =p\n<mark>Grilled Octopus</mark> - excellent - wonderful smokey flavor with a hint of spice to three clearly different parts of the octopus - tentacle, body, and a bit of \"carpaccio\" style octopus over a bed of greens and hot peppers. \n\ni ended up sharing the ribeye with my brother-in-law. this must be ordered by 2 people and is $65/person. the presentation of the thing was pretty awesome. they come out with a huge plate with a ginormous slab of meat and bone, and after showing you, they trim the meat off and place the bone in front of you to tempt you... then they go and slice the meat into smaller portions so it's easier on you to cut and eat. i thought it was done really well - perfectly medium rare, tender, and a nice dry rub on the outside. i can't say it was the best piece of meat i've ever had... especially at that price... but it was good.\n\nmy sister had their spaghetti ai fruti di mare and it looked amazing. huge prawns (head on), an entire lobster, crab... the works over spaghetti. wish i had a bite =p\n\nsides:\ntheir sides come a la carte - so be careful! at $9 a pop, they add up, but the few we tried were pretty good.\n\nrisotto cake - sorta like a crab cake, but stuffed with risotto. i enjoyed it... you get two large cakes.\nspinach with garlic and hot peppers - pretty tasty, but nothing super special.\n\nwe wanted the strawberry panna cotta for desert, but they ran out =(\n\nin any case, it was a good dinner, but a little expensive. the wine was superb. the waiters were very helpful, if not a little overbearing... but i guess they try extra hard there. i'd go back to try some of their pastas... after winning big at the tables =p", 
            "i am so damn broke.  damn you mario batali & joseph bastianich.\n\nwe stayed at the palazzo so we figured... we might as well choose a restaurant within the property and finally decided on carnevino.  the restaurant itself is pretty big and we were brought all the way to the back, which was nice since it wasn't as loud as the main dining room and the high ceiling definitely makes it a nicer place to dine at.\n\nafter looking through the menu, the server somehow convinced us to go the \"family-style\" way, which is priced at a minimum of $100 per person but he would have the chefs prepare the top dishes in each course to share: 5 appetizers, 4 pastas, and 5 different cuts of meat.  he also guaranteed that we would not go hungry even though it was 9 guys.  \n\nit ended up as one of the most expensive meals but pretty legit.  they started out by bringing rosemary infused bread that everybody gets with 2 kinds of spread: housemade butter and flavored pork back fat.  yes, pork back fat, aka lard.  don't be scared cause it was amazing haha.\n\n for appetizers, they brought out:\n\n1. <mark>Insalata Caprese</mark> - amazing caprese salad with thick slices of heirloom tomatoes and a mozarella & cream combo called burrata.\n2. <mark>Grilled Octopus</mark> - freaking amazing.  i never had octopus that tender and the limoncello reduction over it was genius.  \n3. <mark>Fried Calamari</mark> - common item... but damn when it is done this well, i don't want it anywhere else. \n4. hanger steak carpaccio - special of the night and pretty much a pile of arugula with a delicious steak carpaccio underneath and over it.\n5. <mark>Affettati Misti</mark> - selection of house cured meats with a variety of grilled peppers.  the pork belly seriously just melts in your mouth.\n6. grilled foie gras - umm..... yes yes yes.  i think they drizzled a balsamic reduction over it too.  crap.. i'm seriously drooling right now.\n\nas for the pastas, each dish are all appetizer servings but if you want, you can add $15 more to make it into entree size.  all the pasta dishes are much more about the ingredients.  they brought out:\n\n1. potato gnocchi bolognese - just.. really really solid gnocchi with a really good bolognese.  wish there was more bolognese though.\n2. puttanesca - olives, capers, and anchovies with penne.  simple but so good.\n3. beef cheek ravioli - beef cheek = one of the most tender cut of meat ever and they even drizzle aged real balsamic over it.  yea.  heaven.\n4. black truffle pasta - when this came out, i was just... at a loss for words since it had real shaved slices of black truffle all over it rather than the typical truffle oil you see at many places.  the spaghetti itself with made with extra yolk too so the texture was amazing.  favorite out of all.\n\nfor the meats, they bring it all out and they carve it off the bone right in front of you:\n\n1. veal chop - tender, perfectly done.  the bone-in probably gave it extra flavor.\n2. dry-aged bone-in ribeye - i love the seasoning and the crust.  italian seasoned steaks is just good eating.  i still think gallagher's dry-age beef is better though!\n3. <mark>Lamb Chops</mark> - ok this was the best lamb i've had.  i'm not a big fan of lamb because of the gaminess, but somehow it's all good and it is absolutely amazing.  \n4. <mark>Pork Chop</mark> - done medium well, and the way it is brined gives what seems like a really boring piece of pork good flavors.\n5. maine lobster tail - they only brought out one so it was kinda hard to share among all of us but... it was buttery goodness!  hahah.\n\nthey also brought out two sides: mashed potatoes with marscapone & guanciale (type of unsalted bacon) with raw egg yolk mixed in, and sauteed mushrooms & onions.  both were perfect as side dishes.\n\nat first we were afraid that we weren't gonna get full since the appetizer and pastas' portions were not big at all but after everything, we couldn't finish all the protein and it ended up being the perfect late night snack after xs :p\n\nif you come with a big group, definitely think about getting the \"family-style\" since you'll get to truly taste what carnevino is all about.  just expected to drop... quite a bit of money especially if you order wine and after the 20% gratuity charge.", 
            "not the greatest location, with it being on the casino floor, but it had a nice ambiance. we had an interesting experience here with several odd things happening.\n\nfirst of all, one of our party ordered a glass of wine, and as the server poured the wine, he appeared to be spilling wine all over the table, and being indifferent his poor pouring ability. once the splashing was noticed, he realized what was happening, and it turns out that the wine glass had a hole the size of a quarter in the glass. a perfect circle cut out of the side of the glass. very strange. he replaced the glass and served a new glass of wine, and it became a comical event. then things took a turn for the worse.\n\nwe ordered a filet, orecchiette, a ravioli dish, and mushrooms. we ordered the <mark>Grilled Octopus</mark>, as an appetizer, on the servers recommendation. and we also debated on whether to order the brussel sprouts or the broccoli, and again the server recommended the brussel sprouts, so went on his recommendation and went that route.\n\nthen the dinner came, and we were given the broccoli, not the brussel sprouts, and no <mark>Grilled Octopus</mark>. when we asked about the octopus, the server replied 'oh, i forgot to put it in.'.... ?!?!?! then we asked about the brussel sprouts, and he told us we ordered the broccoli, which had definitely not ordered. at this point, things were not looking good for carnevino, it seemed to be a comedy of errors. the server then came and told us he put in the <mark>Grilled Octopus</mark> and he would comp it, which was unnecessary, but appreciated.\n\nfinally, we ate our food..... and all was forgiven. the orecchiette was great, a little small in portion, especially while splitting it between two people, but it had great flavor. the steak was well cooked and had excellent taste. i did not taste the ravioli, but i heard no complaints either. while we were eating they brought out the <mark>Grilled Octopus</mark> and it was completely worth the wait. it tasted amazing. i was with three people who had never had octopus, and were reluctant to try it, but i badgered them to give it a taste, and they all three equally loved it.\n\ndespite the serving snafu's the actual meal was very pleasing. and the server did atone for any mistakes he may have made throughout the meal. i don't know if i would return here, due to all the eating options at the palazzo/venetian, but i would recommend others to give it a try and taste the octopus at the very least.", 
            "i always hear about carnevino and we finally got a chance to try it.  hostess was great, adjusted our table and sat us right away.  the restaurant has a nice atmosphere.  a huge window towards the back to overlook the strip.  in the middle of the room is a large wine table.  \n\nfor appetizers we ordered:\n**<mark>Carne Cruda</mark> alla piemontese\nchopped to order steak tartare with raw mushrooms.\n--my friend loves this dish,  for me, it was ok.  i don't eat raw beef that often unless i'm in canada, but this was ok.  not too memorable for me.\n**<mark>Grilled Octopus</mark>\npickled vegetables and limoncello\n--this dish was my favorite.  the minute you bite into it there's a shot of flavor that goes into your mouth.  \n**<mark>Fried Calamari</mark>\nmarinara and pickled hot peppers\n--you can never go wrong with <mark>Fried Calamari</mark>\n\nfor the entrees we ordered:\n**black fettucine\ncrab, jalapenos, and shallots\n--i've never seen black fettucine and i tried a bit from my friend's plate.  it was very flavorful.  i definitely want to go back and try a full plate\n**tortelloni\nlobster and tarragon\n--this was a delicious dish as well.  this and the black fettucine itself would be a reason for me to come back\n**dry aged bone in ribeye (medium rare)\n--this thing is huge.  they first show you as a whole, and then cut it table side.  they put the bone on the side and explain that it's the meat is very sweet on the bone\n**<mark>Filet Mignon</mark>\n--you're typical <mark>Filet Mignon</mark>\n\nfor our sides we ordered:\n**roasted beets with pistachios and gorgonzola\n**sauteed brussels sprouts with pancetta\n**roasted shiitakes with aceto balsamico\n**italian broccoli with house smoked pork \n\nall the sides were delicious and complimented what we ordered.  \n\ndessert:  \n**sorbetti:  quince, blood orange, pear\n--i loved all 3 flavors.  quince tasted a little like apple sauce, blood orange and pear was just refreshing after a heavy meal\n\nso overall the food was great, service.....well that could've used some improvement.  we had to wave down the server a few times, which didn't make me happy.  when he first approached our table to take our order, one of my friends asked him a question and he excused himself and didn't come back for a while.  later on, when we asked for our bill (after waving him down again) my friends brought it to his attention that they had made it clear it was my birthday when they made the reservations.  we also noticed that one of my friends didn't get the 'vanilla bean affogato' he ordered.  instead it appeared the waiter ordered an americano.  the waiter tried to rectify the situation by bringing out a dark chocolate cake w/ vanilla huckleberries + a candle.  the dessert was delicious, but sort of ruined my refreshing dessert i had ordered previously.  \n\nas my friend duke says, bad service i can tolerate, but i can't tolerate bad food.   so carnevino, you're lucky your food is oh so good lol.  i will be returning to try the black fettucine + tortellini.", 
            "who's been to mario batali restaurant? hand slowly rises, head droops in shame. face turns red with embarrassment. \n\ndo not be embarrassed!!!! i cannot wait to return to this palace of ultimate indulgence. there's a reason mario's famous and we're not. the food is good. italian steak? seriously, mind boggling - beyond my wildest dreams. i adore steak. abe & louie's is my favorite place in the city followed closely by grill 23, benjamin's nyc, joseph's bridgeport, ct, sammy's roumanian nyc.\n\nsituated in the palazzo hotel and casino, the atmospheric attempt at old italy is gaudy and flawed but balanced by the servers in white jackets with proper demeanor. the attentiveness of service is almost astonishing - if you lift your head, a server appears at your side - unobtrusive but very observant. \n\nthe wine list essentially starts at $100 bottle. we ordered sapphires and tonics - perfect mixture:  gin, topped off with tonic. a bottle of carema \"etichetta nera,\" ferrando 2007 breathed while we decided what to order ($150). aired, a deliciously dry vino, perfect to accompany red meat. \n\nthe special cut was a bbl special, bone in rib eye, dry aged for twelve months, for two. this is apparently proprietary beef, trademarked as such. $90 a head. we chose the menu bone in rib eye for two; bbl beef dry aged for nine months at $65/pp. my buddy didn't want to order a starter, but the server wisely suggested that since the steak was going to take about 40 minutes to prepare, it was probably best that we order an appetizer. \n\n<mark>Grilled Octopus</mark> with micro greens, a limoncello drizzle and \"pickled\" vegetables, grilled hot peppers, beets and an olive oil balsamic reduction,  outstanding. meaty octopus tendons, juicy, thick and succulent. the perfect accompaniment to fresh baked foccacia loaf served with house whipped creamed butter and a ramekin of lardo. toasted hot and buttery foccacia - crispy outer shell, pepper coatrd and fluffy inside. \n\nsee picture of whole steak. note the size of steak in comparison to the server's hand on the plate: g-inormous. wheeled over on a cart, placed on a butcher block and carved select slice by select slice and arranged on your plate for consumption, perfect. see arrangement picture, grilled perfectly medium rare. crusted in a tasty black pepper, sea salt and rosemary rub. remaining bone sliced in two and let on separate place for our enjoyment. the meat is really a cut above. i've enjoyed a couple steaks here and there. this was different. succulent, melt in your mouth goodness. primest of the prime. \n\nside of mashed potatoes with poached egg, spinach and ham. unique but exquisite. \n\nthe bill was also prime but you get what you pay for. enjoy.", 
            "service - couldn't be better\natmosphere - posh\nfood - excellent\n\nour party of ten had their sights set on some serious meat and most of us decided on either the dry aged bone in ribeye or the la fiorentina (florentine porterhouse).\n\nbecause our group was fairly large, the waiter suggested doing a family style dinner and allowing the chef to bring out his recommendations. he asked for our per person budget and said the chef would tailor the dinner to our party. \n\nso much food was served that i lost track of what exactly we had, but based on our tab, below is what i think we ate. all i remember was that the food was truly amazing! \n\nthe porterhouse is the the steak that everyone must try. so flavorful, so buttery, so good. \n\nour menu...\n\n- <mark>Grilled Octopus</mark>\n- <mark>Fried Calamari</mark>\n- cheese balls in a napkin\n- affettati (chef's selection of house cured meats)\n\n- beef cheek ravioli\n- cannoloni\n- gnocchi\n- truffle\n\n- ribeye\n- porterhouse\n- <mark>Lamb Chops</mark>\n- black rossini\n\n- mash potatoes\n- spinach\n- mushroom\n\n- fernet branca -- the waiter recommended this menthol smelling, bitter tasting, alcohol infused after dinner drink. it had a medicinal quality to it and was suppose to be good for our digestion, even curing or at least preventing a possible a hangover.\n\nwe did bring two magnum bottles of our own wine. and, whoa, the corkage fee was an astounding $75 per bottle.\n\nwell...a steak house serving their finest foods omakase style.  i loved it. this is one of the best steakhouses that i've ever been to. the service and presentation were superb. everything from the appetizers to the pastas to the steaks was just fantastic. \n\nthe astronomical price (even for vegas) is the only thing holding it back from a fifth star.", 
            "we chose carnevino for our fancy dinner out during a recent bachelorette party. we were happy to find that they were able to accommodate our large group (8 girls) for dinner, but were a little paranoid when they told us they'd charge us $50 for each person that didn't show up. they were also really persistent about checking up on us in the days leading up to the dinner - maybe they have a lot of experience with flakes in vegas?\n\nanyway, we were immediately really impressed by the space. it's dim and romantic and very upscale. they put us in a semi-private little nook which i liked because we were still able to see out into the main dining area but still got some privacy. \n\ni have to say the service here was excellent, though i wasn't so impressed with the food. our waiter was really helpful in determining how much we should order and making recommendations, though i did get the impression that he was trying to upsell us. if we ordered as much as he suggested we would have been too stuffed to walk after our meal! however, he took it in stride when we ordered only some of what he recommended. \n\nthe meal started with some tiny little complementary cheese croquettes, which were a small bite and very savory and tasty, as well as a bread basket with choice of butter or lardo to spread on top, which i thought was a nice touch. \n\nto start, we had the <mark>Grilled Octopus</mark> and two of their salads. i enjoyed the <mark>Arugula Salad</mark> with a triple cream cheese but the other starters were not so memorable. we also went with the ribeye, which was yummy but to be honest nothing special compared to other steakhouses i've been too, both expensive and more affordable. we also weren't super impressed with the pastas we had - a black fettucine with crab, a gnocchi and orrechiette with sausage and broccoli. they were all fine but definitely not memorable (i just had to look up the menu on the website to recall what we ordered!) to be honest, the highlight of the meal was the side of mashed potatoes we ordered, which comes with a poached egg and some sort of bacon type meat. it was so indulgent and rich! but i was a bit disappointed that the mashed potatoes were the highlight of this extravagant meal. \n\nthough i was totally impressed with the ambiance and service, the food unfortunately didn't measure up for me. with so many wonderful restaurants in las vegas, i don't think there's time to waste on mediocre expensive meals!", 
            "i'm surprised that carnevino doesn't have better reviews. i was very impressed the time that i went here with the quality of the steaks. i have to say that based on the quality alone, this is probably one of the best steaks that i have had in las vegas, and surprisingly i didn't have the bone-in rib eye, like i usually do. the price of the restaurant may be a reason for the low ratings, but if solely on the quality of the food, this should be a 5 star rating. the aged steaks are beyond great and probably the reason i am a big fan. they have a huge bone-in rib eye for 2 (that my friends had) and the meat was super tender and cooked to perfection. i had the double <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> that in my opinion was the best <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> that i have ever had - excellent quality of meat, aged and cooked to perfection, a perfect medium rare.\n\nwhat is also great about this place is not only the great steaks, but since they are an italian steakhouse, they also have some really great pastas. we shared the spaghetti frutti di mare which had numerous and generous pieces of seafood. overall very good pasta with many other selections available too. also, the appetizers that we got were delicious. a must try is the <mark>Grilled Octopus</mark>! we also tried the bruscetta which was also very good.\n\nthe one thing that i was disappointed with here was that we did have some leftovers (mainly the huge bone-in rib eye for 2) and we attempted to take them home. however, for some unknown reason, we were given the wrong bag when we left. we discovered the error and i think that they accidentally threw our leftovers out when the table was cleared but they would not say they did that, so we left with no leftovers at all - and i know the steak would have tasted great the next day. the manager did take our drinks off our bill, which was a nice gesture, but we were still perplexed as to what happened. \n\noverall, a must visit steakhouse for those of you coming to las vegas and wanting a higher end steakhouse.", 
            "i concur with many of the remarks about the price.  being an angeleno, i'm familiar with the big bucks for big steak concept but do bring a suitcase of small unmarked bills with you to carnevino.  however, the heart palpitations of the sticker shock subside once you pop that first forkful in your mouth.  i think a good dining experience is one that you are able to relive after the fact by closing your eyes and your mouth waters.  yep, that's carnevino.  \n\nthe <mark>Grilled Octopus</mark> appetizer was an ideal balance of flavors...slight tang to accompany the succulent octopus that you could cut with your fork.  but the magic moment happened when the bone-in ny steak arrived. i hate to attempt to relive it because it makes me want to cry that i can't have it now.  don't bother with the sauces...they are unnecessary. and do yourself a favor and eat your veggies...try the brussel sprouts!  the perfect sip to accompany this dinner?  the saluces colline saluzzesi red.   \n\nheading to vegas?  crack that piggy bank open and experience carnevino.", 
            "***carnevino is expensive, but the meat choices (like the <mark>Bone-In New York Strip</mark> and veals chops) as well as the grill octopus and lobster ravioli are very good***\n\nwhile i am not a big fan of las vegas restaurants, mario batali's carnevino definitely excels at putting out great meat dishes.  we had several of their meat offerings including the <mark>Bone-In New York Strip</mark> and the veal chop and both were very good.\n\nthe <mark>Bone-In New York Strip</mark> was a thick cut and it had a great crispy outside sear, which was flavorful.  the meat was very tender.  it was undercooked at rare, but it still had a good flavor (and was of course moist).\n\nthe veal chop was better.  it was also very thick, but it was cooked more appropriately.  veal chops should be between medium rare and medium and this one was.  the meat was moist and tender while the outside crust was distinct and flavorful.  veal can often be a tad bland, but this one had a good flavor.  this was probably the best veal chop i have ever had.\n\nthe <mark>Lamb Chops</mark> were just okay.  unlike the other meats, the <mark>Lamb Chops</mark> were not that thick.  they were a tad overcooked and while they did have a decent flavor and were tender, they were just not as juicy as they should have been.  also, the outside crust was not as good as the veal or the <mark>Bone-In New York Strip</mark>.\n\nwe had two other dishes that were also very good.  one was their <mark>Grilled Octopus</mark>.  i've heard batali's <mark>Grilled Octopus</mark> at osteria mozza is very good.  this one was exceptional.  the octopus was very soft (which can be difficult with octopus) and it had a great flavor.  there were some good pickled vegetables on the side and maybe something else like prosciutto to give it a nice savory flavor.\n\ni have not enjoyed many of batali's pastas, but i did like his lobster anolini.  the lobster filled ravioli was very good--moist with a great lobster flavor.  the cream sauce was mixed with tarragon and it was flavorful and fragrant without being overly buttery or rich.\n\nmost of the other items were in the just okay range.  the <mark>Arugula Salad</mark> featured a triple cream, but the triple cream was surprisingly dry and a little hard.  the bruschetta was okay (as was the big eye tuna crudo).\n\nwe had the pappardelle <mark>Italian Broccoli with Garlic and Pork</mark> mushrooms and while the pasta sheets were good, the pasta went cold quickly.  it was also a little bland.  i was expecting the braised pork agnolotti to have a more impactful filling, but it was not as moist or savory as i was hoping for.  the garnish of chanterelles was good though.  there was a little bit of <mark>Fregula, Pecorino Romano, Butternut Squash</mark> on the plate, but it did not provide the sweet flavor i was expecting.\n\nmost of the sides were just okay (like the spinach and the roasted beets), but the mashed potatoes with mascarpone and a poached egg were rich, creamy and quite good.\n\ni had the flourless chocolate cake for dessert and it was okay.  i am not the biggest fan of flourless chocolate cake because it can be too dry.  while it was a little bit dry, it had a good (but maybe not great) chocolate flavor.\n\nservice was good.  the staff was attentive and the food came out at a good pace.\n\nprices were high (which is common in las vegas), but when you share several of their dishes (family style), you might be able to save a little bit of money.\n\ncarnevino has very high ceilings and a loud atmosphere.  the place has the look of other expensive steakhouses--kind of masculine looking with lots of dark browns.\n\nthe meat at carnevino is very good and it is up there with some of the best a la carte steakhouses i've tried.  i am not the biggest fan of these steakhouses, but carnevino is one of the better ones and they even have a few other good things (like the lobster ravioli) to balance out the meal.\n\ncarnevino is located in the palazzo, which has free parking (valet or self).", 
            "steak and wine! what else can i say! been to this place 2 times already and just sat at the bar..... i guess i like doing that!  this place is pretty expensive so i hope that you are going after a strong dice roll at the tables! we started with  the <mark>Grilled Octopus</mark> and the jamon plate... both were fantastic! we had a aperitif and then a glass of wine suggested by john the bartender. he also suggested a pasta before the steak, on one occasion we had the gnocchi and the other the raviolo which i thought the raviolo was much better.  we then had a masterpiece of steak slightly charred from a blazing oven, the dry aged bone in rib eye!  absolutely mouth watering tender  with that amazing char broiled flavor!   one of the best ive ever had , even though i was a little drunk by then! the next time we tried the filet and the <mark>Bone-In New York Strip</mark> .... both were good, but not the same as the rib eye. needless to say you will pay for the rib eye, but i would strongly suggest that if you were going to go there. our bartender with his salvador dali moustache was mixology at its finest making a perfect cocktail and keeping our wine glasses full. we even got to try a few unique different spirits on the house to try next time! well worth it and a fantastic place in vegas!", 
            "i absolutely love this restaurant! i actually had dinner alone at the bar and had one of the best experiences in las vegas! first--you must ask if j.t. is working the bar. he is so much fun and really knows his drinks and mixology. actually, the entire staff is beyond amazing and this is one of my new fav spots. \nif you love sipping on a great bourbon, tequila or vodka and don't mind spending $$ on a great drink, you have to ask the bartenders what their favorites are! \ni met so many great people at the bar that had actually come back from the previous night just to see j.t. and have him make them cocktails and recommend what they should have for dinner.\n<mark>Grilled Octopus</mark> - yummy (4 people has it while i was there)\ni had the orecchiette pasta, it was really great and the portion size was perfect.\ni love that you can order side dishes, salads, dinner and desert at the bar or in the main dining room, which is beautiful! \nsuch an amazing experience! ask for beluga vodka, if you are into sipping on an amazing imported vodka from russia. it is perfect chilled with a twist.", 
            "omg you must get the <mark>Grilled Octopus</mark>!!! best dish of the night besides the porterhouse steak. \n\ngreat service and hot server!  definitely a family style meal with the dishes.  we had a party of 7 and ordered 2 steaks and a bunch of sides. if you're also looking for a pasta dish, the gnocchi was great.", 
            "food is out of this world.  very expensive but worth it. try the <mark>Grilled Octopus</mark>!", 
            "even my mom was impressed with carnevino...and that's a high standard to meet.\n\nwe came here with a group of 7. the gm came out and personally greeted us at the hostess stand when he heard our party had arrived. they had a beautiful table set up all the way in the back of the restaurant (through the wine cellar room, which i thought would have been a cool place to sit as well). with very high ceilings and paintings on the wall, the back room felt like we were in someone's old world castle. it was quiet, romantic and i loved the ambiance. needless to say, service was absolutely impeccable. \n\nsome of us started with bellinis. the chef also sent out some complimentary apertifs. our food order was massive:\n\nappetizers:\n-caprese salad\n-stracciatela (proscuitto and mozz)\n-<mark>Grilled Octopus</mark> served over octopus sashimi (my favorite, the <mark>Grilled Octopus</mark> really was perfectly prepared and so tender)\n-steamed clams (the broth was soooo amazing)\n-lobster with the tail served sashimi style\n\npasta:\n-garganelle bolognese (because i was craving some sort of spicy pasta i requested the bolognese sauce to be made spicy and the chef added a very nice amount of heat)\n-orrechiette \n-beef agnolotti\n\nentrees:\n-dry aged bone-in ribeye (for 2 people) this thing was massive, i will upload a pic. we took the gigantic bone home for my mom's teacup malteses. so spoiled.\n-<mark>Filet Mignon</mark>\n-<mark>Lamb Chops</mark>\n-bison (available on their special menu)\n*note that the meat prepared at carnevino is prepared a little less than requested. for example, if you request medium rare, it will come out closer to rare.\n\nsides:\n-spinach\n-mashed potatoes\n-<mark>Fregula, Pecorino Romano, Butternut Squash</mark>\n-cauliflower gratin\n-porcini mushrooms\n\ni tried little bites of everything. we were all so full that dessert could not even be considered. the service and food were absolutely outstanding and i can't wait to experience carnevino again soon.", 
            "always a spot on our trips to vegas, and certainly not disappointed.\n\nthree of us at the bar had a latest dinner and put our faith in the staff (thanks cooper and josh) to pick food for us.\n\nstarted with perfect steak tartare, <mark>Grilled Octopus</mark> that again was done perfectly (no easy feat to not under or over cook).\n\nthere was some beef cheek ravioli, and finished with a bison bone in ribeye that they sliced up for us to share and was cooked and seasoned perfectly.\n\nwow, great wine list - super hot hostesses although i wouldn't ask them a question again...", 
            "great service, nice ambiance, awesome octopus and a standard steak for the price you pay for it. for me, the steak was the weakest part of the meal, but by no means does that mean that it was bad. in fact, it was excellent, just nothing new. \n\nthe highlight was the <mark>Grilled Octopus</mark>, soft and full of flavor. i also tried the gnocchi and yellow tail, both which were great, but not octopus level. \n\nwe ordered a side of mashed potatoes, which came with a \"super egg\" as it was described to us. apparently the chicken is only given a diet of flax seed and chrysanthemum flower. whatever.. mixed into the potatoes it was awesome.", 
            "absolutely wonderful!! took my wife for her birthday dinner. were greeted by this server who has the most luscious beard in aall of vegas. mind you he is not even that old. we try their <mark>Grilled Octopus</mark> which was cooked to perfection and their steak is simply phenomenal.\n\ni tried their linguine al fruite di mare which did not dissapoint with the grreat portion of seafood. just too little of a pasta i guess.\n\ngreat dessert combination and wonderful service. absolutely must try for those of you who like to wine and dine.", 
            "as a self proclaimed foodie i was very excited to check out carnevino and wow, it completely exceeded all of my expectations!  i must say if you are visiting this restaurant you need to ask for the server mj, he walked us through the menu and every suggestion was spot on to what we were looking for and he was incredibly knowledgable from the wine to the dishes and provided the highest level of service.  (even came back from the restroom with folded napkins -little details of service matter!) my husband and i love eating out and if you are looking for great quality food, awesome music, ambiance and exceptional service, do yourself a favor and go here.  mj suggested wonderful options from the <mark>Grilled Octopus</mark> and prosciutto to wonderful handmade pasta to our favorite the bone in ribeye for two omg, you haven't had \"steak\" till you have carnevino steak.  by far an all around winner, thanks carne and our server for making this experience one for our favorite food experiences ever!  will definitely be back!", 
            "located in the palazzo hotel and casino, owners batali and bastianich's carnevino stays true to its billing as an italian steakhouse. the menu is varied and has some unique options, including a <mark>Grilled Octopus</mark> starter and a 20oz bone-in veal chop, both of which were superb. the service on the other hand was weaksauce. after ordering dinner and a (very expensive) bottle of wine, we didn't see our server again until dessert. overall, decent food, but if you're looking for attentive service you may want to look elsewhere.", 
            "beautiful restaurant, but don't want to pay for atmosphere. <mark>Grilled Octopus</mark> was delicious. <mark>Zach's Chopped Salad</mark> was ok.    rib eye for 2  priced at $74. each was very overpriced.  i did not finished my portion and asked to take with me.  they did not give me what i left on my plate.  would definitely not recommend.  service was just ok.  if you have to waste about 2 1/2 to 3 hours for dinner this is the place for you.  overall very overpriced.  delmonico steakhouse is a much better choice at the palazzo.  take my advice if you are looking for an excellent steak.", 
            "i came to carnevino this past saturday with a group of friends (8 in all).  we all enjoy great food and wine and don't mind paying for it, which you will certainly have to do here. \n\nwe shared a lot of food family style. arugula and <mark>Zach's Chopped Salad</mark> were both excellent. the <mark>Arugula Salad</mark> has some type of pickled onions in it, making it super tasty. we had the <mark>Grilled Octopus</mark>, which was cooked absolutely perfectly, steak tartare and tuna carpaccio. all the apps were spot on. \n\nwe shared 4 pastas for 8 of us and they were all good. the spaghetti frutti di mare was fantastic. all the others, i felt, were too similar and not adequate enough in portion. i feel like a little bit more of them would have been more suitable. \n\nthen, we shared entrees. we had the lamb, which i didn't try but looked good, the porterhouse (amazing!), the salmon (which i found a little boring), the bbl new york (out of this world taste - so super herbaceous and so intense), brussels sprouts (love the simple preparation). \n\nin terms of service... hmmm. i'm torn. our front service seemed absolutely ambivalent about his work there. he did a good job, but kinda seemed \"over it.\"  the back waiter, on the other hand, was super nice. we were in one of the side rooms, which was a little disappointing because you want to be in the middle of the action. we had 4 bottles of wine for the table and both were a great pairing with the food. \n\none last note: in the middle of the waiter's initial menu spiel, i accidentally spilled my $15 glass of wine that i got from the bar.  the waiter didn't refill it. it's subtle, and it isn't that we were in any way lacking for food or wine, but when you're spending $170/person to eat (which is what our bill came out to), i would expect that service point to be paid attention to.", 
            "my son and i recently had dinner at this restaurant in the pallazo owned by mario batalli and i have always wanted to eat at one of his places. we sat at the bar and had incredible service from eric and cooper. we asked them what the best things on the menu were and they instantly recommended the steak tartar and the <mark>Grilled Octopus</mark> to start. we ordered those and they were insane...cannot believe <mark>Grilled Octopus</mark> could be so tender and delicious. so then they said we need to share the bone in sirloin which had been aged 120 days. it to was fantastic and they actually carve it off the bone for you table side. i cannot recommend this place enough but i think sitting at the bar made the difference for us as the conversation with these two bartenders was really fun", 
            "we dined at the bar, which was super, due to dominick d. and eric, h. by following their recommendations, we had an awesome experience. they gave us excellent service, friendly, and knowledgeable of their menu and huge wine list. the <mark>Grilled Octopus</mark> was outstanding! beef cheeks ravioli,  unique,as well as the sweetbreads. dessert of chocolate and peanut butter, and crunchy, was not sickening sweet.  thank you dominick and eric, and the mgmt., for hiring such a team !", 
            "attention meat eaters!\n\nfirst, logistics: full menu at the bar unlike many of the competing steakhouses in town. this makes it inexcusable for you to miss this place. no reservations--just plop down at the bar and go to town.\n\nit saddens me to think that a meat lover would visit vegas and not get an opportunity to try the riserva because they read some ridiculous reviews on yelp. i was almost one of those people. i was even afraid after realizing how easy it was to get reservations here compared to other places which were full. but i listened to my gut and it didn't fail me. and since you don't need reservations at the bar, if you are in town more than a couple of days, just swing by every night to see if the riserva is available.\n\ncut and craftsteak are frequently mentioned as having the best steak in town. i've never been so i won't even doubt that the overall experience and service is better. however, when in the land of excess, do something you cannot do elsewhere. i can eat imported japanese wagyu where i live or buy 3-5 week dry aged or prime beef, give it a lovely smokiness with oak or hickory and make it taste as good as many steakhouses. but can you eat 280 day dry aged beef (the age on my visit) anywhere in this country??? no!\n\nsome do not like the taste of dry aged meat. if you are one of those people, then your money is probably better spent at some other restaurant. but, if you are one of those that like the nuttiness and funkiness then come here. i repeat: you cannot get this kind of meat anywhere else in this country. i repeat: you can get basically the same cut of meat from almost any other restaurant at home. most of these guys get their meat from allen brothers, lobel, pat lafrieda or debragga. as an aside, the miyazaki filet from debragga online is the 2nd best steak i've ever had. the riserva was #1.\n\ntheir regular steaks i believe are aged 60-90 days, twice the standard time. i do want to come back to see if this is noticeably different from a shorter time. usually the funkiness really starts developing after  4-5 weeks.\n\ni was here a couple of weeks ago on a monday. i sat at the bar like i usually do. i was alone. this removes a lot of the problems with service that invariably occur. i got there around 7:30 pm. i asked if they had they had the riserva and i lucked out. vegas baby!\n\nbartender also recommended the <mark>Grilled Octopus</mark>. i grew up eating octopus but in my later years didn't really enjoy it as much. having said that, get this! delicious. these are big chunks, meaty, tasty, not chewy at all, lovely texture and in some type of sweet balsamic reduction ... or something like that. anyway, so good. went well with my negroni and vieux carre.\n\nas for the steak? freaking amazing. got 1 inch worth which was maybe 12 oz of actual meat. this was more than enough. the meat is so heavy (not gristly fatty but an \"oily\" fatty) that you can't eat that much. two could easily share the riserva ribeye but of course as a man, i ate it alone. amazing. best steak ever. yes, it could have used a tiny bit more salt but the meat was the star. not as funky and cheesy as i thought it would be but still more than your average steak. very tender. got mine medium rare and it was fantastic.\n\nfor those complaining about prices, this is the strip. everything is overpriced. you want overpriced? go to some of the other places and pay $34 per ounce of japanese wagyu when you can get it back home for $20/ounce or buy it for $12.50. it's the same stuff you can get from debragga. but $108/inch cut of 280 day dry aged beef? totally worth it.", 
            "carnevino is one of the early restaurants i've bookmarked on yelp (2011!), and i've finally kicked this one off my food bucket list. \n\nfirst a disclaimer - my friend has a sister who used to work with the the staff here, so we had amazing service. with that said, onto the food...\n\nthe appetizers - we got to try the <mark>Grilled Octopus</mark>, <mark>Carne Cruda</mark> alla piemontese (steak tartar), and the lonza.\n\n1. <mark>Grilled Octopus</mark> - i've never tried octopus this tender. always have i thought that octopus is always chewy and tough, but the way carnevino cooked it was amazing. the light citrusy sauce and the sprouts complemented the octopus well - easily one of my favorite things of the night.\n\n2. <mark>Carne Cruda</mark> alla piemontese (steak tartar) - solid steak tartar. comes with mushrooms on top and what i believe are thinly sliced oyster(?) mushrooms on the side. very good, comes with delicious crostinis. \n\n3. lonza - interesting fava beans and ricotta salad. it was a great balancer to other heavier things, although i wouldn't really put this on the top of my list to order. \n\nonto the pasta. \n\n1. beef cheek ravioli - this is a secret dish that i believe is from mario's other restaurant, b&b. we got it with truffle on top. this was heavily talked up, but not exactly my cup of tea. when it comes to pasta, i prefer red sauce over white, meaning this dish was way too rich for me. delicious nonetheless, but not my favorite.\n\n2. gnocchi - surprisingly good. i never usually like gnocchi so this is quite possibly the best gnocchi i've had. comes with english peas, prosciutto, ricotta salata. it's not over the top rich and it's really chewy. \n\n3. orecchiette - sweet sausage and broccoli rabe, come in red sauce. this was the best pasta of the night. so addicting and chewy. get it.\n\nnow the main course - meat.\n\n1. <mark>Lamb Chops</mark> - split between 6 people, we got one rack each. the lamb was so tender and did not have that gamy flavor lamb usually has. v\n\n2. porterhouse for 2 - definitely the star of the show. you come here to get this. the filet side of the porterhouse was soo tender and juicy. especially the part attached to the bone. one of the best steaks i've ever had. \n\n3. bone in ribeye - this was better than the strip part of the porterhouse, but worse than the filet. all around, it felt like the better bang for the buck than the porterhouse.\n\nof course they wouldn't let us leave without dessert...we had two things but the strawberry shortcake was money.", 
            "i was in town with friends to celebrate my bday and we chose this restaurant to have a classy dinner. the ambiance was very cool although i was curious why they needed an anatomically correct bull in the restaurant. \n\nthe service was phenomenal from our very helpful waiter to the sweet sommelier who recognized a girl who knows what she wants when he sees one. \n\nfood wise, we sampled a lot. this included our standout favorite, <mark>Grilled Octopus</mark>, light citrusy scallops and a salad to start. for our entrees, we shared a variety if steaks. they sure do undercook things here by a lot so mention your preferences more than twice. they thankfully refired the bloody as hell new york that i asked to be well done. i don't dig red cow- just brown cow for me. our sides of asparagus and the mashed potatoes were to die for though. love. never had an egg in the potatoes before though. our desserts were the pans cotta, a peanut butter thingy and cannoli. the peanut butter dessert came with a bday candle in it and happy bday written on the plate. yay! \n\nall in all, i can happily recommend this place and will return.",

            "we keep coming back to this place every time we are in vegas. from the drinks to the dessert , perfection. the bone in ribeye is the best steak we have ever had ! the wine list is extensive . we had the <mark>Grilled Octopus</mark> appetizer and it was so tender. we chose sides of roasted beets which were juicy and the decadent mashed potatoes. every bite of the ribeye was heaven on earth. the homemade gelato - i had pumpkin spice - was the perfect ending to this dining experience. the service is second to none, friendly without being stuffy. i love it when i learn things about food from the staff and they are well versed in all aspects of the choices on the menu. worth every penny spent there !",

            "i finally had the chance to join four others and have dinner at carnevino.  we have heard so much about this restaurant from michael u.  he set up the dinner with the staff at carnevino.\n\nwe started with some cheese puffs and then we were each given a nice roll.  with the roll came to spreads, lardo and butter.  the lardo was superb!  fatty, salty, and just the right accompaniment to a tasty roll.\n\nseven appetizers were next up served family style.  the items were <mark>Grilled Octopus</mark> with pickled vegetables and limoncello; <mark>Carne Cruda</mark>--their made to order chopped steak tartare; pastrami slices with two fried eggs and some greens; stracciatella; two wood platters of cured meats--one with mortadella, salumi, coppa, lomo, and nduja and one with prosciutto; and a dish of peppers, some stuffed with cheese.  with the appetizers, we got some sliced, toasted bread and some more lardo.  there were also more rolls brought to each person.\n\nnext up we had two pastas--beef cheek ravioli topped with sliced white truffles and gnocchi with fresh cut figs.  \n\nnext was the reason we were there--meat, in particular, their riserva, a dry aged meat done in a way no other restaurant is.  our two inch slice of riserva was aged 254 days.  we also got a veal chop and a ribeye that was 100 day aged.  after showing all three meats on the table, they were cut table side and then placed back on the table.  with these meats, we had five vegetable dishes--mashed potatoes with an egg that was mixed into the potatoes at the table to make them creamier and tastier; brussels sprouts, eggplant parmigiana, saut\\u00e9ed spinach, and thick cut garlic fries.\n\nthe meal ended with four desserts.  we had some cheesecake, panna cotta, a chocolate, peanut butter torte, and semifreddo.\n\nthe star of the evening was the riserva.  the flavor is hard to describe.  there's a small bleu cheese flavor but the flavor comes from the oils from the fat that are in the meat.  we were warned to eat some of the ribeye first and then move on to the riserva.  the difference was remarkable.  the appetizers and sides were good.  the vegetables should have been hotter.  perhaps they were waiting too long while the meat was cut.\n\nservice was outstanding.  our waiter, shepard, was on top of everything and he had a great personality that made dinner a little more special.\n\nall in all, a special evening with some friends enjoying some good meat.  a return visit sometime is a must.",

            "vegas is a city of decadence, and if you're staying at the venetian, carnevino is a pretty good place to splash down your cash. it's fancy and expensive, with a lovely upscale ambiance and top notch service. the carne and vino are excellent.\n\ni went for dinner with my family during a weekend stay at the venetian. there were six of us, and we sat at a comfortable tucked-away table that felt like a luxury poolside cabana looking into the rest of the opulent dining room. service was on point. our waiter corey was friendly and attentive, and he took really good care of us. the sommelier was also helpful. we asked her to recommend a wine and ended up getting a magnum of barolo. it was a wonderful wine, perfect for our meal, and it came in the largest decanter i've ever seen, which the thin sommelier hefted around like a champ.\n\nthe food was delicious, actually much better than i expected given the yelp reviews. i thought carnevino was on par with other batali restaurants, and i love me some batali. our meal kicked off with complimentary cheese bread, soft warm puffs packed with flavor, along with some crusty rosemary ciabatta rolls served with butter and lardo. we then shared a neat spread of appetizers. the best of these was the <mark>Grilled Octopus</mark> with pickled vegetables and limoncello. this was some of the best octopus i've ever had, tender and meaty, firm without any toughness. there was some nice heat to it too--i think there were some fresno chiles in those pickled vegetables. the prosciutto di parma \"riserva\" was great to share, a large platter of silky prosciutto ribbons, served with sliced apple. we added gnocchi fritto, these fried bready pillows, to eat with the prosciutto, and they were lovely. we also shared two pastas, which became appetizer-sized when split six ways. the beef cheek ravioli was tremendously good. delicate triangles of pasta came stuffed with a rich, hearty filling of beef cheek, all served in a butter sauce drizzled with 20-year balsamic vinegar. this dish is a carnevino and batali signature (i'm pretty sure i've seen and coveted it...iron chef??), but it is technically off menu. your server is sure to mention it, but if not, it's worth an inquiry. the orecchiette with sweet sausage and broccoli rabe was also fantastic, the thick, toothsome ears of pasta in a satisfying tomato sauce.\n\nfor the meat of our meal, we ordered both of the large format steaks--the dry aged bone-in ribeye and la fiorentina, or classic florentine porterhouse. this was a real feast, with both steaks carved up and served on enormous plates. both were cooked a beautiful rare medium rare, red velvet with a seared, seasoned crust. they tasted different from each other but not in a way i could describe well, even at the time--they were both juicy and perfectly cooked, and i couldn't state a preference for one over the other. just bring everyone you know and get both. we also ordered a couple sides--the charred brussels sprouts and the mascarpone and guanciale mashed potatoes. these were tiny sides, definitely sized for individuals, but we each all got a few bites of each. they were great. the sprouts were nice and roasty, with a pleasant brightness from the lemon zest in the gremolata. the mashed potatoes were rich and creamy, laced with face bacon and a poached egg.\n\nwe were pretty stuffed by the time dessert came around, but we rallied and split a couple between the six of us. the chocolate peanut butter torte was a dense, gorgeous slice of indulgence, served with peanut brittle and salted caramel sauce. the gelato and sorbet was a great way to end the meal--we got lemon curd gelato and tangerine and blood orange sorbets, all citrusy, light, and not too sweet. about what i want after a whole lot of steak.\n\nthis was an expensive meal (most of it was comped, courtesy of the venetian's love of asian gamblers), but probably worth a splurge if you're looking to eat and drink well while on vacation. it's hard to beat good steak and wine, even harder to beat good steak, wine, octopus, pasta, etc. i'd love to come back to carnevino, and will keep it in mind next time i'm looking to go big in vegas.", 
            "singularly spectacular meal. of note, the <mark>Grilled Octopus</mark> is not. to. be. missed. additionally, seriously consider the tartare... very, very well done. the dry aged ribeye for two was our choice, one of the best steaks any of us have ever tasted. \n\nall told, this was a top five.. if not the very best... of lifelong meal experiences. not cheap. not for the faint of heart. well worth it, if only to say that you've enjoyed the best possible steaks and accoutrement available. \n\nsuitable only for the most special of special occasions... if you ate this well every day, you'd be an utter and complete asshole, and very, very fat. cheers.", 
            "my wife and i visited vegas for a weekend which meant we had to be selective about where to eat. we heard about carnevino and given the celebrity chefs involved and decent reviews we decided to give it a shot. \n\nupon arrival we were promptly seated. it took a minute for water to arrive but that was fine. the menus are ridiculously oversized, nearly 2 feet tall and 3 of the 4 pages are bottled wine. the menu is so large it's awkward to hold. more on the menu later. our young waiter was eager to help but slightly arrogant and trained to push you toward the more expensive options. he left us to review the menu. \n\none of their specials is listed on a smaller menu which consists of a multi meat tasting, i think it was 5 varieties, and a desert. no sides or salads included. of the 5 courses one had pasta. given that both celebrity chefs are italian we definitely wanted to try some pasta. the tasting is $150 per person while the matching wine pairing is $80 per person. add a couple sides and you are over $500 for a couple, which is fine, but the food and service better be top notch for there to be any value at this price. \n\nafter considering the tasting we decided against it mainly because we wanted more variety from the and thought selecting exactly what we wanted provided a better value. from the antipasta section we choose the <mark>Grilled Octopus</mark> and the beat salad. \n\nwe really struggled with choosing entrees and here is were the menu really became a hindrance and frustration. remember the menu is sized for a giant at nearly 2ft tall so holding it and talking with others at your table is a challenge. the entrees are broken down into pasta, veal, lamb, fish and red meat. the meat section which is what they are known for is in the middle and has 5 or 6 options. the signature steaks are the dry aged bone in ribeye and the porterhouse. the waiter made sure to point out the dry aged ribeye and explained the steaks are \"hand carved\" table side. sounds simple enough. the trouble began when the pricing for both of these meats were listed for 2 people, $152 for the ribeye and $170 for the porterhouse. since we really wanted to try the pasta this left us with a dilemma. we asked the waiter for assistance and he explained they could serve the ribeye for one at $95 but that the porterhouse was only served for 2. we asked for more time to decide. i love steak like anyone but $95 for a ribeye, even dry aged, is pricey. i asked the waiter how many oz. but he did not know and the menu does not specify sizes anywhere. ultimately we choose the ribeye for one and the beef cheek ravioli which the waiter highly recommended. \n\nthe bread arrived along with the butter <mark>Italian Broccoli with Garlic and Pork</mark> fat. the butter was excellent but i didn't care for the overly salty flavor of the fat. the appetizers arrived quickly and we really enjoyed both the octopus and the beats. if i'm being picky the octopus was slightly over cooked but we ate every piece.\n\nwhile waiting for the entrees to arrive we asked the waiter for wine recommendations with our entrees. he immediately recommended a glass of italian red wine without much hesitation. we are not wine experts and neither of us were familiar with the grape variety. we asked for a taste and he kindly brought a sample. the wine was not full bodied as he described although it was peppery and spicy, maybe he confused the two. my wife liked it and ordered a glass while i asked for something with make body, more tannins, like a cab. he brought a glass of a cab which worked out much better for me. given the importance of wine, 3 pages full on the menu, i was not impressed with the waiters knowledge. \n\nthe entrees took about the amount of time you would expect. the steak was rolled to the table on a cart for carving. one of my biggest disappointments was they never once asked if the steak was cooked to our liking. we ordered the ribeye medium but received medium rare, red throughout. i don't mind a rare steak, i order a filet rare but i prefer a ribeye cooked medium to allow the fat to loosen up more. since they already carved it and placed it on the table we choose to let it go rather than complain and delay the meal. if you've ever eaten at an eddie v's the ribeye will remind you of their tomahawk bone in ribeye. the steak was good had a unique flavor perhaps due to the dry age but i was not blown away. the value just wasn't there. if you are going to set my expectations with a lofty price then you better bring your a game. my wife sort of enjoyed the beef cheek ravioli but i thought it was awful. the pasta was good but the beef cheek filling had the texture of baby food and the flavor wasn't much better. i'm a texture guy so your mileage may vary. \n\nlong story short, high price, poor/average experience means no value. i recommend you look elsewhere in vegas. i debated between 2 or 3 stars but after thinking through our meal again i left it at a 2. harsh but fair given the expectations they set.", 
            "my wife and i had an early dinner here on mother's day. the atmosphere was well done, and the service was exceptional.\n\nour waiter recommended a <mark>Grilled Octopus</mark> appetizer. we're not generally seafood eaters, but thought it would be fun to try something new. it was outstanding, and i highly recommend it. \n\nwe skipped the pasta course and went straight for the 90 day dry aged new york steaks. they were well prepared and gid tasting. i think they may have oversold the aging process. it was certainly a delicious steak, but i feel i've had equally delicious cuts at ruth's chris or similar restaurants. the prices here were slightly higher in my view than those types of locales, so i feel like it's more of a premium for the mario batali name. just under $300 for a shared appetizer, two steaks, a shared side, and a glass of wine each. \n\nstill very good. mashed potato side was very tasty. i would recommend it,  just be prepared for the cost.",

            "6 of ate here together for dinner and loved it.  \n\nfor appetizers we shared the beef cheek ravioli and <mark>Grilled Octopus</mark>.  all was delicious, quick and hot.  my favorite was the beef cheek ravioli.  i'd be happy ordering that again as just a dinner. \n\n6 of us shared two of the bone in ribeye with two sides.  that was more than enough for our hungry and hearty group.  we ordered both medium rare.  our server informed us that they typically under cook the meat so we ordered one medium and one medium rare.  food arrived on time after our appetizers and was cut table side.  wonderful.  \n\nwe were frustrated with the wait time for our check.  this is one of my pet peeves for most restaurants.", 
            "we had the <mark>Grilled Octopus</mark>, oysters, and off-menu pasta - beef cheek ravioli - which were all super and extremely tasty. we also had the dry-aged ribeye steak for two. the server clarified that the steak price - at the time of our dining 2 for $76 - was $76 per person, so it was a $152 steak. i think that's a bit misleading on the menu, but okay, i get it. we ordered it anyway and while it was a good steak, i don't think it was a $152 steak. we had the grilled asparagus which was perfectly executed and i would definitely recommend. \n\nalthough the wine list was extensive - even including slovenian wines which we rarely see in the states (and had just come back from slovenia a week prior), the least expensive wine on the list was $75. depending on your tastes and how much you want to drink, it might make more sense to order from the selection of wines by the glass. if i were to go again, i think i'd make a meal out of appetizers and pasta and skip the entrees. \n\nmusic was a bit on the loud and hipster side and didn't really suit the overall feel of the restaurant which reminded me of being in an elegant hotel in europe.", 
            "my wife and i visited vegas for a short weekend which meant we had to be selective about where to eat. we heard about carnevino and given the celebrity chefs involved and decent reviews we decided to give it a shot. \n\nupon arrival we were promptly seated. the menus are ridiculously oversized, nearly 2 feet tall, and 3 of the 4 pages are bottled wine. the menu is so large it's awkward to hold. more on the menu later. our young waiter was eager to help but slightly arrogant and trained to push you toward the more expensive options. he left us to review the menu. \n\ntheir specials are listed on a smaller menu which consists of a multi meat tasting, i think it was 5 varieties, and a dessert. no sides or salads included. of the 5 courses one had pasta. given that both celebrity chefs are italian we definitely wanted to try some pasta. the tasting is $150 per person while the matching wine pairing is $80 per person. add a couple sides and you are over $500 for a couple, which is fine, but the food and service better be top notch for there to be any value. \n\nafter considering the tasting we decided against it mainly because we wanted more variety and thought selecting exactly what we wanted provided a better value. from the antipasta section we choose the <mark>Grilled Octopus</mark> and the beat salad. \n\nwe really struggled with choosing entrees and here is were the menu really became a hindrance and frustration. remember the menu is sized for a giant at nearly 2ft tall so holding it and talking with others at your table is a challenge. the entrees are broken down into pasta, veal, lamb, fish and red meat. the meat section which is what they are known for is in the middle and has 5 or 6 options. the signature steaks are the dry aged bone in ribeye and the porterhouse. the waiter made sure to point out the dry aged ribeye and explained the steaks are \"hand carved\" table side. sounds simple enough. the trouble began when the pricing for both of these meats were listed as, $76 for the ribeye and $170 for the porterhouse, except thats the price for each person. since we really wanted to try the pasta this left us with a dilemma. we asked the waiter for assistance and he explained they could serve the ribeye for one for $95 but that the porterhouse was only served for 2. we asked for more time to decide. i love steak like anyone but $95 for a ribeye, even dry aged, seemed pricey. i asked the waiter how many oz. but he did not know and the menu does not specify sizes anywhere. ultimately we choose the ribeye for one and the beef cheek ravioli which the waiter highly recommended. \n\nthe bread arrived along with the butter <mark>Italian Broccoli with Garlic and Pork</mark> fat. the butter was excellent but i didn't care for the overly salty flavor of the fat. the appetizers arrived quickly and we really enjoyed both the octopus and the beats. if i'm being picky the octopus was slightly over cooked but we ate every piece.\n\nwhile waiting for the entrees to arrive we asked the waiter for wine recommendations with our entrees. he immediately recommended a glass of italian red wine without much hesitation. we are not wine experts and neither of us were familiar with the grape variety. we asked for a taste and he kindly brought a sample. the wine was not full bodied as he described although it was peppery and spicy. my wife liked it and ordered a glass while i asked for something with more body, more tannins, like a cab. he brought a glass of a cab which worked out much better. given the importance of wine, 3 pages full on the menu, i was not impressed with the waiters knowledge. \n\nthe entrees took about the amount of time you would expect. the steak was rolled to the table on a cart for carving. one disappointment was they never once asked if the steak was cooked to our liking. we ordered the ribeye medium but received medium rare, red throughout. i don't mind a rare steak, i order a filet rare but i prefer a ribeye cooked medium to allow the fat to loosen up more. since they already carved it and placed it on the table we choose to let it go rather than complain and delay the meal. if you've ever eaten at an eddie v's the ribeye will remind you of their tomahawk bone in ribeye. the steak was good and had a unique flavor perhaps due to the dry age but i was not blown away. the value just wasn't there. if you are going to set my expectations with a lofty price then you better bring your a game. my wife enjoyed the beef cheek ravioli but i thought it was awful. the pasta was good but the beef cheek filling had the texture of baby food and the flavor wasn't much better. i'm a texture guy so your mileage may vary. \n\nlong story short, high price, poor/average experience means no value. i recommend you look elsewhere in vegas. i debated between 2 or 3 stars but after thinking through our meal again i left it at a 2. harsh but fair given the expectations they set.", 
            "if you're visiting and planning on splurging a bit on a nice dinner check out carnevino. the choices for our anniversary dinner consisted of mucho carne and a little octopus to keep the night interesting. we started our dinner with the <mark>Grilled Octopus</mark>. it was extremely tender, a fish/chicken texture that is surprisingly delightful. next entr\\u00e9e was the sharing of the beef pur\\u00e9ed ravioli which was recommended by the waiter. i shouldn't have shared!! ha! so far he was 2 for 2 on the recommendations!", 
            "most wonderful experience ever.  it was a perfect combination of exceptional food, service, and ambiance.  we actually chose to wait patiently to sit at the bar to be served there by brad and adam.  their knowledge of wine and drinks are second to none and heightened the whole experience.  \n\nwe had:\n<mark>Grilled Octopus</mark>\nred russian kale\ngnocchi\n2 inch 180 day aged new york reserve\ndry aged bone-in ribeye for two\nfried cauliflower\nroasted beets\n<mark>Italian Broccoli with Garlic and Pork</mark>\nmultiple hand-selected wines, bitters, <mark>Italian Broccoli with Garlic and Pork</mark>\n\nabsolute food porn with every sip and every bite.  going back for sure.", 
            "we came for a conference in vegas and would love to try the culinary experience of chef batali at palazzo. i am not much of a steak person but since it is one of the most brag dish, i and my girlfriend tried it and of course the two waiters were explaining several times the price is $76each as we share the rib eye bone in steak as our main dish.\n\ni specifically ask for medium well just pink in the center but it was served bloody  (my preference should have been heard not how they wanted it cooked!)after it was cut and was taken back to the kitchen of course it became well done!the steak was no longer moist and palatable and we ended up not finishing most if it!\n\nwe tried the pasta special with truffles which i can't barely taste it, and half a bowl for $55 and the <mark>Grilled Octopus</mark>  (i would say this was prepared and cooked right! ).\n\nfor the side, we had brussel sprouts and mashed potatoes with egg  (they added bacon tidbits that is the only thing that made it good)!but not out of this world.\n\nthen we completed our dish with tiramisu again a mistake was made so we got two desserts because they gave us the chocolate and peanut butter torte first which we did not order  (servers said it is now a compliment from the chef since it is already in our table).we got a cappuccino and a green tea.\n\ni paired my steak with pinot noir and  i must say it was good wine but for glass it was way out of price.\n\ni was hoping to get a well compensated worth of dining experience with respect to what i paid for but it failed my expectations .i must say the service was great except for not getting my order right with the steak and the dessert .\n\nlastly, we have a complimentary chef cheese puff pastry instead of a regular bread.", 
            "our 1st stop in a three-day batali restaurant trifecta beginning nov 5th at carnevino, the 6th at b & b, and the 7th at our happy place, otto.  paulo made the arrangements for us and our friends visiting from the east coast, and we felt very special by the pampered treatment, beginning with beautiful glasses of prosecco to complimentary tidbits.  we tried a wide assortment of dishes, and some of my favorites were the <mark>Grilled Octopus</mark> that was so flavorful and tender.  the scallops were gorgeous, and the moscato poached pears were devine!  subtle sweetness combined with a delicate prosciutto - very nice!\n\nfor our next course we opted for a few pastas.  i love that the menu is seasonal, and the pumpkin tortelli was done so elegantly.  of course we had to order some of their famous beef, which was succulent, tender, and oh-so-tasty.  carved table side, it's a wonderful part of the overall experience.  i had dreams of the guanciale mashed potatoes, and so there was no way i was going to miss those with the quail egg cracked open table side and gently stirred in, they are luscious!  one of our favorite servers from otto, louis, is at carnevino, and so it was very nice to see him and say \"hello!\".\n\nthank you to jeff metcalf, general manager, for making our 1st stop a very special evening!"

            "now this is an exercise in restaurant grandeur, and mario batali and his wait staff here do not disappoint.  walking by the restaurant in the palazzo, you do not get the sense of impressiveness; it just looks like a little restaurant tucked away near the entrance of the casino.  however once the maitre'd starts walking you to your table in the main dining room....the experience begins.  i was belittled by the tall ceilings, soaring arches, artwork and the feeling of old italia.  even better is that the restaurant goes on forever, and you'll know what i'm talking about when you go to the restroom (private dining room after private dining room flanked by rustic wooden cabinets filled with bottles and bottles of wine as far as the eye can see.  yeah, this is how they do it here, and it is no joke.  \n\nlet me state that i researched all the top vegas restaurants before deciding to eat here, and so glad we did.  at carnevino you're going to get the best of the best quality ingredients, and classic dishes prepared expertly.  i had the pre-theatre menu, going with the <mark>Tagliata di Manzo</mark> (<mark>Arugula Salad</mark> topped with slices of parmigianino and beef carpaccio), the <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> (medium rare), and the gelati.  we also added in two pasta dishes we wanted to try, beef cheek ravioli and black truffle linguini .... and both were so amazing; pasta perfectly tender and flavors beyond comprehensible.  i would highly recommend trying the pasta -- portions are small so you could easily split one or two.  it just doesn't get any better than the filet at carnevino.  expertly prepared, it is as good as it gets.  the great part about the pre-theatre menu is that you get the same steak on the full menu for a fraction of the price.  the wine list is also beyond.  had the las rocas tempranillo to start, and then went with a full-bodied italian for the steak.  \n\nnow for the service... in a word, top notch.  our waiter was the most articulate and knowledgeable of ingredients, food, preparation i can remember.  he actually got us excited about the history of food...now that is a good waiter. \n\nin sum...carnevino is an experience...so come planning to spend a lot of time having your meal.  my one regret is that we were on our way to a show so couldn't linger for longer. i've been to several of batali's restaurants...del posto, babbo, lupa, and carnevino is my favorite so far.  don't miss this place.", 
            "after spending so many years in the restaurant industry i thought i had a good understanding of what a steak house should be. i have never been so wrong in my life! carnevino from the service to the execution of each plate was nothing less then perfect.\n\nmy fiancee and i were amazed at just how attentive and just how perfectly the staff worked together to take care of not only us but each table.\n\nour dining experience started off with <mark>Tagliata di Manzo</mark> arugula, parmigiano drizzled with ages balsamic and the <mark>Grilled Octopus</mark> pickled vegetables and limoncello. the bar was set high with these first offerings and only got better and better with the progression of each course.\n\nwe moved on to our pasta course. we had \nricotta and egg raviolo with brown butter. i have to say that each bite was blissful and decadent. it's one of those dishes you will think about long after its gone. we also had the beef cheek raviolis with aged balsamic. the plate was all to quickly bare and i just wanted more!!\n\nnow we come to the meat which is the realm of one of the most talented chefs i know adam perry lang. \n\n                                  ( bbl beef\n\nour all natural bbl beef is hand selected and aged in our meat chamber by our man adam perry lang. bbl beef is often beyond regular usda prime standards for marbling and flavor and is hormone and antibiotic free. we rub all of our beef with sea salt, black pepper and fresh rosemary to get a delicious and slightly charred crust.)\n\nmy fianc\\u00e9e chose the filet i had the \n<mark>Bone-In New York Strip</mark> 16 oz dry aged bbl beef. \nto co-star with our steaks we ordered the porcini bearnaise, mascarpone & guanciale mashed potatoes, <mark>Tuscan Fries</mark> and \"creamed\" corn with <mark>Chopped Pickled Peppers</mark>. \n\nto begin with the steaks are masterfully carved for you table side then sprinkled with finishing salt and drizzled with olive oil. to say my steak was good would be not only one of the greatest understatements of my life but it would be sacrilege. it was prefectly cooked and it melted in my mouth. the co-stars or sides just seem to enhance what we were consuming. my favorite were the mashed potatoes maybe because of the yolk or because of the bacon either way everything was incredible.\n\nour dining journey ended with caramel panna cotta caramelized bananas, raspberries as well as \nplum, peach and mango sorbeti. \n\nthis is one of those places that will change the way you look at food and is an experience you must have at least once.",

            "as a huge fan of osteria mozza, i was really looking forward to eating at carnevino and had high hopes.  my expectations, however, were a bit tempered by the fairly large number of negative reviews on yelp.  i have to say that overall the food was very good as was the service, but nothing was particularly memorable and it was definitely overpriced - even for a steakhouse.\n\nperusing the menu beforehand, km and i were interested in the beef tasting menu, but the very first thing the waiter told us when we sat down was that the tasting menu was only available if all five of us wanted it.  since three folks didn't, km and i were out of luck.  our group ended up sharing a couple appetizers, sides, bottles of wine, and km and i shared the bone in ribeye for two.\n\nour dishes included:\n-- bread with lardo: this came to the table right away.  i wasn't particularly enamored with the lardo.  it has an interesting flavor but i would've preferred some olive oil.\n-- <mark>Carne Cruda</mark> (steak tartare): excellent preparation of steak tartare.  exactly as it should be done.\n-- italian brocolli with smoked pork: pork makes everything better but even with the pork this dish just wasn't very exciting.\n-- mashed potatoes with poached egg: very good, rich, and creamy.  i'll have to try to make this at home.\n-- bone-in ribeye for two: the waiter cut this tableside and added a bit of salt and olive oil.  a very good steak, cooked perfectly, but definitely not the best i've ever had.", 
            "if in the future i commit some terrible crime and am sentenced to death and therefore offered the historical \"last meal\" i will request carnevino. yes my friends, it really is that good. \n\nmy better half and myself ordered the \"beef tasting\" menu with the supplemental \"wine flight\". as soon as we sat down, our server promptly greeted us and slowly went through each of the specials for the evening. we hemmed and hawed on splitting the rib eye for two but she talked us into the beef tasting menu assuring us we would not be disappointed. what we ate: hand-cut <mark>Carne Cruda</mark> with brioche and local egg. to die for. i could have ate five servings of this. it was delicious, slightly buttery, melt in your mouth meat. my boyfriend loathes eggs with a passion but even he admitted that somehow mario batali magically transformed that egg into something he relished. next came the beef cheek ravioli with aceto balsamico. the server explained to us that the balsamic was aged 125 years. 125 year old balsamic? i fought the urge to channel my inner ghetto child, however, she won out and i asked for more bread so i could sop up the extra balsamic that was left on my plate. seriously it was that good. next we had a wet aged beef that was served with some sort of thinly sliced au gratin potatoes. next was a dry aged beef. desert was a chocolate panna cotta and vanilla biscotti. \n\nevery single thing i ate that night surpassed my expectations. the service was spot on. i loved that they literally educated you on several processes, varietals, etc. while you sat there. for the quality of food and service i felt the price point was more than fair.",

            "i would say my experience here was an outlier.  my party gave the waiter carte blanc about the meal we wanted to eat tonight.  with a little bit of a lot of alcohol i am sure we were taken advantage of. our meal topped out with tip above a grand.  please be sure to not buy what ever remainder of truffle they may want to sell you by the gram.  the shaving over whatever you shave it on after you drank as much as we did won't make any difference to your already blunted senses.  i think we paid for the 10grams of truffle $150. we probably used 2-3 grams on our food and did even bother to take the rest home.  \n\nthe waiter brought out several things on or off the menu per our preferences.  we told him before hand that we like meat and pasta.  we also told him, them, whom ever was taking care of us, that if they saw the glass less than 3/4 full that they need to be johnny on the spot with the refills.  they were a bit slow on that but its not like we noticed.\n\ni am not exactly sure what we ordered but i will describe them and if you find that it is something you want to try then you might be able to describe it.\n\nwe ordered the prociutto, <mark>Carne Cruda</mark>, and bison carpaccio for starters.  i was not a fan of the prociutto which i thought was cut to thin to handle. the cruda was terrific.  \n\nwe also ordered the ravioli and the wet aged beef with the quail egg.  my personal opinion is that the beef with quail egg was the best part of the meal.  the ravioli was soft and filling.  we also ordered the beef that came out with a giant rib that sits on the table.  when we walked into the restaurant a gentleman was actually eating from this rib that resembled a dinosaur rib that was stolen from some natural history museum.  \n\nat this point we were into a second bottle of wine.  what was interesting which i thought was a nice touch is that they opened the wine and poured it into a decantur.  all other restaurants i have been too did not do this and this was different and kind of cool.  \n\nof note, try the lardo.  it is the fat off a pigs back. if anyone has read the book \"heat\" which is written by a food journalist who worked out of mario batoli's kitchen in new york knows what i am talking about.  the journalist describes lardo quite well.  my friends thought this to be a bit heavy and thought it was lard.  it is not.  it does kind of have a tang to it but its good and worth trying.\n\nyou certainly don' have to spend a fortune to eat here.  we overendulged ourselves and made the most of it.  i liked it and the staff was eager to please but its probably because we kept ordering stuff.  the atmosphere is dark and sophisticated and great for meat lovers and wine drinkers.", 
            "the food in general was pretty good, what i went for (the steak) was incredible in flavor. but everything else just annoyed me about this place. also, i was saddened that such minor and stupid mistakes can really screw a place up. i wish these so-called money-making chefs such as mario batali would keep a closer eye on their establishments. i want to like all his food, restaurants, regardless of the city it's located in or the type of cuisine he has chosen.\n\nthis is what i had:\n1. <mark>Carne Cruda</mark> alla piemontese - chopped to order steak tartar with raw mushrooms\n- is there any other way to make steak tartar besides doing it to order? \n- the steak was fresh and delicate. the only criticism i have on this is; i wish it had a tad bit of acidity. \n2. shrimp \"alla diavola\" - in the style of calabria\n- this was the biggest shrimp i have ever seen. \n- it was one big ass shrimp on a spicy and very delicious tomato sauce. \n- had i known it was going to be one big ass shrimp, i would not have ordered it. as big shrimp tend to be tough and flavorless. the smaller ones are sweeter and juicier. \n- plus it was fishy. \n3. dry age bone in rib eye (for 2)\n- this is what i came here for. \n- it arrived flintstone-style and was cut table side, just the way i like it. \n- perfectly cooked\n- smelled of what i imagine heaven smells like.\n- juicy, tender and melts in your mouth like butter\n- only complaint: i wish they did a better job cutting this beautiful piece of meat. the rib eye gods would not be happy.   it was slightly sloppy and did not have a very appetizing presentation once it was put on my plate. \n4. sides:\n- mascarpone and guanciale mash potatoes: pretty good. probably will forget about this after this blog is done. \n- shelling beans with pancetta: not good, except for the large chunks of pancetta, which i could have had anywhere. \n\nif you wanna read more go to : http://www.bitchingitout.com/index/carnevino.aka.meatwine", 
            "truly a meat lover's paradise.  got the beef tasting menu and overdosed on beef .  bbl aged ribeye was fantastic.  <mark>Carne Cruda</mark> was excellent.  highly recommend those 2 dishes.  tasting menu portions are pretty large so not sure if it would be worthwhile.  you may be better off sharing plates of the same dishes rather than forking out $150 pp.", 
            "i am really baffled by all the hate for carnevino in the reviews. i first came here about 5 years ago when i cam to vacation in las vegas and have been back probably 10-15 times since i moved to las vegas. i always go when people are in from out of town and want a good steak place so i have been with about 20-30 different people. never have any of us gotten a bad item, had bad service, or not loved it. i am a unapologetic fine dining snob and until gordon ramsay steak opened this was my favorite steak restaurant in vegas- and for the steak itself it is probably slightly better than grk (grk has better non steak dishes and desserts). i can't wait for someone else to visit so i can try the new beef tasting menu. \n\nthe restaurant comes from mario batali (orange crocs) and joe bastianich (the mean judge on amster chef). if you have been to any of their other restaurants carnevino is similar in many regards- formal fine dining atmosphere, similar slowly paced service, the waitstaff likes to talk etc. this isn't for everyone- some people just want to order their food and have it delivered in less than 10 minutes without a lecture on italian after dinner drinks (grappa by the way is an acquired taste- i almost gagged the first time i had it but now i love it). if you do go to carnevino give yourself at least two hours and have a backup liver waiting for transplant. \n\nthe steaks\nusually i would start with appetizers but let's be honest- you are here for a giant slab of meat. \n\n here are the steaks i have had ranked in order\n\n1. bone in ribeye for two. this is carved tableside. if you like ruths chris serve your steak at 1500 degrees sizzling deal you might not like this as it is served more room temperature- and if it is warm at all the heat quickly goes away from the thinly sliced meat. it is very tasty though- the seasoning is very light so its all beef taste.\n2. ny strip- not usually one of my favorite cuts but i have gotten it a few times for variety and it is better here than elsewhere i have had it.\n3. bone in filet- superior to the boneless imo- has the very soft texture and less beefy taste you expect from a filet. \n\nnow, not always, but most of the time, they have a special steak that is aged longer- if this is available for the love of all that is holy get it. pay whatever they ask- 100$ a pound, 200$ a pound, your first born- whatever it takes. these steaks taste like nothing you have ever had or likely will have again in the future. they have an almost blue cheese like flavor that is incredible. i have had plenty of expensive food that i would say was not worth it- this is not one of those. \n\nnon steak items- i have ordered a few of these - <mark>Pork Chop</mark>, osso buco, and they are great- if you are a local and can come here frequently i highly encourage you to try them. if you are in from out of town though, you probably just want to get a steak or you will return him and find yourself lying awake in bed, filled with regrets.\n\nappetizers- there are quite a few beef appetizers. you can go two ways with this- some people will find beef on beef on beef to be too much- we call them french. so if you are worried about your blood test results get something else, if you love america here are some suggested apps (not all of these are beef but are meat)\n\n\n1. <mark>Carne Cruda</mark>- raw beef good. \n\n2.prosciutto di parma and <mark>Affettati Misti</mark>- picking between these two is slightly harder than sophie's choice\n\n3. beef cappallacci -this has some really strong goat cheese which is amazing but may knock your socks off. \n\n4. anolini- lobster pasta- whats not to love", 
            "carnevino is one of the early restaurants i've bookmarked on yelp (2011!), and i've finally kicked this one off my food bucket list. \n\nfirst a disclaimer - my friend has a sister who used to work with the the staff here, so we had amazing service. with that said, onto the food...\n\nthe appetizers - we got to try the <mark>Grilled Octopus</mark>, <mark>Carne Cruda</mark> alla piemontese (steak tartar), and the lonza.\n\n1. <mark>Grilled Octopus</mark> - i've never tried octopus this tender. always have i thought that octopus is always chewy and tough, but the way carnevino cooked it was amazing. the light citrusy sauce and the sprouts complemented the octopus well - easily one of my favorite things of the night.\n\n2. <mark>Carne Cruda</mark> alla piemontese (steak tartar) - solid steak tartar. comes with mushrooms on top and what i believe are thinly sliced oyster(?) mushrooms on the side. very good, comes with delicious crostinis. \n\n3. lonza - interesting fava beans and ricotta salad. it was a great balancer to other heavier things, although i wouldn't really put this on the top of my list to order. \n\nonto the pasta. \n\n1. beef cheek ravioli - this is a secret dish that i believe is from mario's other restaurant, b&b. we got it with truffle on top. this was heavily talked up, but not exactly my cup of tea. when it comes to pasta, i prefer red sauce over white, meaning this dish was way too rich for me. delicious nonetheless, but not my favorite.\n\n2. gnocchi - surprisingly good. i never usually like gnocchi so this is quite possibly the best gnocchi i've had. comes with english peas, prosciutto, ricotta salata. it's not over the top rich and it's really chewy. \n\n3. orecchiette - sweet sausage and broccoli rabe, come in red sauce. this was the best pasta of the night. so addicting and chewy. get it.\n\nnow the main course - meat.\n\n1. <mark>Lamb Chops</mark> - split between 6 people, we got one rack each. the lamb was so tender and did not have that gamy flavor lamb usually has. v\n\n2. porterhouse for 2 - definitely the star of the show. you come here to get this. the filet side of the porterhouse was soo tender and juicy. especially the part attached to the bone. one of the best steaks i've ever had. \n\n3. bone in ribeye - this was better than the strip part of the porterhouse, but worse than the filet. all around, it felt like the better bang for the buck than the porterhouse.\n\nof course they wouldn't let us leave without dessert...we had two things but the strawberry shortcake was money.", 
            "everything still stands from my previous review plus they've added a cicchetti menu which is the italian version of tapas. my wife and i ordered one of each of the 10 offerings and they were all delicious with special consideration being given to the <mark>Carne Cruda</mark>. amazing cocktails and a very talented bar staff and props to the always amazing chef nicole.",

            "i finally had the chance to join four others and have dinner at carnevino.  we have heard so much about this restaurant from michael u.  he set up the dinner with the staff at carnevino.\n\nwe started with some cheese puffs and then we were each given a nice roll.  with the roll came to spreads, lardo and butter.  the lardo was superb!  fatty, salty, and just the right accompaniment to a tasty roll.\n\nseven appetizers were next up served family style.  the items were <mark>Grilled Octopus</mark> with pickled vegetables and limoncello; <mark>Carne Cruda</mark>--their made to order chopped steak tartare; pastrami slices with two fried eggs and some greens; stracciatella; two wood platters of cured meats--one with mortadella, salumi, coppa, lomo, and nduja and one with prosciutto; and a dish of peppers, some stuffed with cheese.  with the appetizers, we got some sliced, toasted bread and some more lardo.  there were also more rolls brought to each person.\n\nnext up we had two pastas--beef cheek ravioli topped with sliced white truffles and gnocchi with fresh cut figs.  \n\nnext was the reason we were there--meat, in particular, their riserva, a dry aged meat done in a way no other restaurant is.  our two inch slice of riserva was aged 254 days.  we also got a veal chop and a ribeye that was 100 day aged.  after showing all three meats on the table, they were cut table side and then placed back on the table.  with these meats, we had five vegetable dishes--mashed potatoes with an egg that was mixed into the potatoes at the table to make them creamier and tastier; brussels sprouts, eggplant parmigiana, saut\\u00e9ed spinach, and thick cut garlic fries.\n\nthe meal ended with four desserts.  we had some cheesecake, panna cotta, a chocolate, peanut butter torte, and semifreddo.\n\nthe star of the evening was the riserva.  the flavor is hard to describe.  there's a small bleu cheese flavor but the flavor comes from the oils from the fat that are in the meat.  we were warned to eat some of the ribeye first and then move on to the riserva.  the difference was remarkable.  the appetizers and sides were good.  the vegetables should have been hotter.  perhaps they were waiting too long while the meat was cut.\n\nservice was outstanding.  our waiter, shepard, was on top of everything and he had a great personality that made dinner a little more special.\n\nall in all, a special evening with some friends enjoying some good meat.  a return visit sometime is a must.",

            "we hit up carnevino for a very late lunch the day we got into vegas, and were very happy that a friend had recommended this lovely batali location.  despite the fact that it's situated in the palazzo, at the far end of the strip, it was well worth the death hike.  i can only speak for the taverna (open noon to who knows when) - sadly, we could not afford dinner here.  :)\n\nwe got the infamous hamburger and a <mark>House-Made Pastrami Sandwich</mark>, splitting each.  <mark>The Burger</mark> came with some with crispy pancetta and bleu cheese, and i believe some grilled onions.  my husband swears it's the best burger he's ever eaten ($19).  the pastrami ($18) was house-cured and very good - the sandwich's mustard overpowered it somewhat, but the meat itself was excellent.  <mark>The Burger</mark> came with boring, from-a-plastic-bag chips, but never fear - we got a side of the tuscan \"fries\" - really fingerling potatoes cut in half and roasted, then coated with garlic and parmesan.\n\nhandily enough, if you order an entree before 5pm, you can also get two beers, bellinis, or bloody marys for $11 - we got the bellinis, and they were extremely tasty.  smelled like a peach orchard.  :)  they also served us fresh focaccia that was was warm and basted with salt water and truly wonderful.\n\nthe decor was full of rich wood, marble flooring, and friendly, warm lighting.  it was like being in a very cozy, 5 star dining room (go figure).  we also watched wine being very properly decanted (two decanters and prepared glasses) at the table next to us.  i would love to try some of their steaks for dinner - i'm sure the experience would have been divine.  batali and his friend created a wonderful space that has something to offer every visitor, regardless of their income.  stop by for a snack, if nothing else!  it's worth a visit!", 
            "we were really excited to eat at a mario batali restaurant and was not disappointed by carnevino's food and service. to start off, the bread and butter were simply delicious. i ordered the cannelleno pasta (w/duck and cheese) - it was super good! the husband ordered the steak and eggs - he swears it's one of the best steak & eggs he's ever eaten. the steak and eggs were cooked perfectly, and the accompaniments (potatoes and arugula) went well. the husband's parentals got the ribs (just okay), beef carpachio (good) and the <mark>House-Made Pastrami Sandwich</mark> (yum). the end of the meal neared and they brought out gelato (vanilla, chocolate, espresso) and sorbet (blood orange, pear, peach) on the house! apparently the whole computer/register system was down, so they were trying to bide some time for it to get fixed - a nice touch to a potential bad situation. the blood orange sorbet and chocolate gelato were superb. an excellent meal, indeed!", 
            "crap. indeed such crap it single handedly put me on a \"famous chef\" hiatus.  my wife and i went to carnevino just for a quick bite. we ordered of the taverna menu as we didn't want the full \"experience.\"\nthe menu came, dirty, stained, and torn; nasty. the server brought out \"a complement from the chef\" some cold, greasy, hush-puppy like dough ball. i asked if it were supposed to be warm and the server said \"yes.\" well, sorry to surprise you, it wasn't.\nwe ordered the <mark>Arugula Salad</mark>, tagliatelle <mark>Italian Broccoli with Garlic and Pork</mark>, and the house made <mark>House-Made Pastrami Sandwich</mark>. the <mark>Arugula Salad</mark> was in a bath of white vinegar and nearly inedible. the tagliatelle was salty enough to choke a cow and cows lick pure salt! but worse, far worse, worst of all, was the <mark>House-Made Pastrami Sandwich</mark>; two massive slabs of dry, crumbly bread, more arugula, and the thinnest of thin slices of pastrami. i didn't see any pastrami so i opened the sandwich removed a slice to taste the pastrami. i still don't know what it tastes like! the horseradish mustard overpowered everything. i combined the two halves of the sandwich into one and it still had less pastrami than a sandwich you'd find in a vending machine at a train station yet just as appetizing!\nfrom now on, if i don't see that damn famous chef in his/her restaurant, i'm not eating there. never, ever again."

            "full review in the blog - only reason for a star off is the paucity of dessert choices at lunch.  at dinner i imagine this place is a solid 5.\n\narriving toward the end of the lunch hour we entered carnevino dressed casually - a tad out of place compared to the all black and white clad service staff.  seated promptly and greeted by josh nearly the moment we were seated the service never faltered throughout our stay - water was refilled rapidly, dishes served impeccably, and bread service...we'll get to that later.  browsing around the large room and high ceilings, dark woods, and white tablecloths covering widely spaced tables the restaurant definitely felt very batali - and the soundtrack of beatles, eagles, the who, and stones coming from the front of the house left no doubt.\n\nmy buddies having already begun their daily drinking at the tables and myself a non drinker we all opted for water - water with ice and multiple refills.  after taking orders and heading to the kitchen we were brought the first of a couple rounds of dinner rolls.  tasting the incredibly complex sweet yet salty and crisp exterior which yielded a pillow-soft interior not unlike a croissant i inquired of our server what exactly constituted these delicious pieces of carbohydrate - lardo, butter, flour, yeast, and \"a bit of parmesan\" i was informed.\n\nallowed to sit and chat for a while before our mains arrived i joked with my buddies about the fact that we had gone to, arguably, the best steak restaurant in vegas and neither had ordered a steak - one opting for the tuna caponata, cocoa agro dolce and the other choosing <mark>The Burger</mark> with pancetta and onion cheddar and <mark>Arugula Salad</mark>.  stating that steak was a \"dinner food' i clearly realized that i needed more epicurean friends.  all joking aside, both of them loved their meal and their dishes looked and smelled excellent  - while my one friend didn't prefer the cocoa accents to his tuna he loved the fish and my other friend stated <mark>The Burger</mark> was the best he'd ever tasted.\nfor myself, the decisions for this meal were based on previous batali experience and both dishes wowed - as expected.  served together since neither of my friends opted for an appetizer the first dish was from the dinner anti-pasti menu and was entitled \"house-cured pastrami\" with local duck egg and emerald butter lettuce.  while i generally don't prefer beef textures, particularly \"lunch meats\" such as pastrami i was told by mr. feit that this dish was more like beef bacon and was made from the dry-aged stock of bbl beef.  trusting his judgement i have to admit this dish was very impressive with the pastrami truly being like a clean and spicy pork bacon in texture - great fattiness and almost melt in the mouth texture despite its somewhat dehydrated nature.  accompanying the pastrami - a single duck egg sunny side up alongside a delicate and dare-i-say \"buttery\" lettuce.  atop the dish was a combination of aged balsamic, olive oil, cracked pepper, and pan juices from the slight pan-kissing of the pastrami.  breaking the yolk of the egg the dish was given a creamy contrast to the other sharp, spicy, and acidic flavors and truly impressed.\n\nthe second dish, also requested from the dinner menu, was entitled sweetbreads \"al boscaiolo\" which according to my server meant \"lumberjack style.\"  served with pan seared mixed/chopped mushrooms, fresh peas, spinach, and a reduction of honey, rosemary, and perhaps sage the sweetbreads were perfectly flash fried to retain their creamy texture and without a bit of brine.  clearly using a bit of salt, pepper, and perhaps cheese in the crispy coating the sweetbreads on their own would have been superb - but pairing their creamy and spicy preparation with the crisp yet mildly sweet greens, woody and smooth mushrooms, and heavily accented honey made the dish a truly one of a kind experience - while not as \"refined\" as guy savoy's preparation the night prior these may have actually been my favorite sweetbread preparation all time - or at least on par with the versions at alex, savoy, and (as much as i dislike admitting it) michael symon's lola.\n\nfinishing up our meals we were told that the dessert menu at lunch was limited to cheeses and ice creams and as such we deferred - too bad since the peach fritters and roasted spiced dates sounded excellent.  settling the tab the meal was actually my cheapest lunch or dinner in vegas yet extremely rewarding.  while i could've certainly done without the eagles (i hate the f&%ckin' eagles man! - lebowski) the service was excellent and accommodating from e-mail all the way to leaving the restaurant and the food was superb.", 
            "first thing i wanted to do while in vegas this year was get a burger at blt burger in the mirage. but on our way over there from our hotel (encore...meh) we saw a lunch \"special\" at carnevino. $30 for a burger, salad or homemade chips, and 2 drinks (a choice of bloody mary,  bellini's or peroni beer, mix and match at will). yeah, it's a little on the pricey side, but this is vegas so it's to be expected. \n\nfirst off, the hostess couldn't be nicer. and our server (along with his helper) were also super nice. even though we all went with <mark>The Burger</mark> special, not once did i feel like they were blowing us off because we didn't order the insane steaks or entrees. absolutely incredible service. completely different experience than the one we had a switch in the encore. but i'm straying off course. \n\n<mark>The Burger</mark> was a mix of 3 different meats, wish i could remember which ones, topped with pancetta and gorgonzola cheese. these burgers were cooked to absolute perfection!!! nice and medium, exactly how i asked for it. the flavors just make my tastebuds uber happy happy. my side of homemade chips were also excellent. i haven't had a potato chip in years and i couldn't stop eating these. i even stole a few from the better half when she turned away. for my drinks i ordered a bellnio and a peroni. the bellini was kinda fru-fru (peach and champagne i think) and refreshing but the peroni was just what i needed to beat the vegas heat. \n\nabsolutely an great experience while popping in for lunch. would definitely recommend hitting there for lunch if you're around the palazzo.", 
            "had <mark>The Burger</mark> brunch with two perfectly made bloody marys and it was perfect and spot on.  our burgers were perfectly made and huge.  the gorgonzola cheese and italian ham on it was a delicious combination.  i was pretty drunk by the end of the meal, so i did not flinch much at the $80 price tag for two.  our servers were really nice and infomative.  i am now a batali fan!  its a beautiful restaurant, i just wish there was one back home in san jose!",

            "i've been to carne vino several times now. i don't know why, well, yes, i do, it's for the bread sticks. they're to die for. if you want to have a drink and don't mind paying more than almost anywhere else on earth, then by all means stop in and enjoy. i rationalize that it's just the price of having those crack-like bread sticks.\n\nthat's really where my love for this place ends though. just a word about price. here's an example of how insane the prices are. i went in for lunch last week (and bread sticks) and the house special was $40 for  two drinks and a tuna sandwich. if you just wanted the tuna sandwich it was $19, and i believe <mark>The Burger</mark> was $20. i'll admit that i've had $120 burgers in europe, so it's not the most expensive, but for what you get (i sat for 30 minutes in an empty bar and the bartender never returned to take my order) it's just not worth it.\n\nfirst time in, we all had steaks. the quality of the meat was definitely far behind other steakhouses like the palm over at caesar's, sw steakhouse, delmonico's, del frisco's and the others we've tried here. overly fatty and tough. it's always possible that you just go on a bad night, so i never write a place off because of one so-so experience.\n\nso, we went again and my wife and i had the carpaccio (it was okay, just nothing to write home about) and i don't even remember the entrees. i just remember that both of us kept marveling throughout the meal at the prices vs. the quality, particularly in light of what you get for lower prices at the other restaurants in vegas, even in the same hotel (palazzo has equal and better food at woo (now closed), cut (amazingly good) and table 10 to name just a few.\n\nsave yourself some money and visit one of those other places where you'll get better food for less money, or for about the same money (at cut) just better food and service.", 
            "i sort of feel a little bad giving this place five stars (again) after our recent repeat trip here. after reading all the reviews, i guess service really does make that difference for most people (me included), however, once again we have walked out of this restaurant with happy sighs escaping our lips. \n\nnormally i am not a re-reviewer (tee hee) but our last meal and drinks here in the tavern prompted me. came in on a monday at lunch time and had drinks and burgers in the taverna area. scott, our bartender was great. we ordered two of the $19.00 burgers and as i cringed a little over <mark>The Burger</mark> price, i sipped on my blood orange martini to take the edge off. once <mark>The Burger</mark> arrived i realized i would have paid $25.00 for that burger. hands down the best burger i have ever had in my entire life. the beef was fabulous and topped with a generous thick slice of pancetta and white cheddar? oh my taste buds were singing an aria to mario. my boyfriend orders the house made chips as his side, while i opted for the <mark>Arugula Salad</mark>. we both agreed the <mark>Arugula Salad</mark> was a better choice as its bitterness and tartness balanced out the sheer delicious richness of <mark>The Burger</mark>. oh and the truffle aioli? i can honestly say i have found a mushroom i will eat. scott topped off my martini once too! thanks buddy! they have a special before 5, any two bloody mary's, bellini's, or beers for $11.00 bucks. hey that is a good deal, anywhere.", 
            "the staff is very friendly and accommodating. as expected, very expensive, but that is las vegas casino restaurants for you. i ordered \"<mark>The Burger</mark>\" and it was delicious, but definitely not the greatest burger i have ever eaten, especially for $30. the sides were actually the best part of the meal. the asparagus salad was amazing and the parmesan crusted french fries were out of this world. i went specifically for \"<mark>The Burger</mark>\" and if you are looking to splurge on something simple, delicious and expensive, then give this a try.", 
            "we have been here 5 times over multiple visits to vegas.  once for dinner and 4 times for lunch.  this review is for the lunch visits.\n\nthe first time <mark>The Burger</mark> was cooked medium rare which was nice and juicy with the perfect amount of pink.  the truffle aoli tasted great on <mark>The Burger</mark>.  the home-made chips was tasty and crispy.  our waiter was great and wish i caught his name.  told him we were sharing.  he had the sandwiches cut in half in the kitchen.  that extra effort earned him extra tip.\n\nthe second time <mark>The Burger</mark> were overcooked.  the waiter (different than the first time) did come by to ask how the meal was and we should have sent them back.  we didn't enjoy our burgers.\n\nthe third time <mark>The Burger</mark> was cooked medium rare again...yay!  would not recommend the house-made pastrami though.  for $21 you get a very small sandwich which was not all that memorable.  no fries or chips come with that $21 sandwich.\n\nthe fourth (and final time) <mark>The Burger</mark> was again overcooked.  getting tired of the inconsistency.  again, we would be sharing two different sandwiches so we asked the waiter to have the kitchen cut them in half before serving.  the waiter told us we could cut them in half ourselves table side.  seriously???  a customer is asking for a service and you tell the customer to do it?  the waiter was terrible, not attentive at all.  wish i remembered the waiter's name.  we were tempted not to tip but in the end we left him 15% anyway (grudgingly).\n\nthat last visit was the last straw though.  we won't go back.  too bad they can't be more consistent in cooking their burger and they really need to improve their lunch service.  even if it's not busy, it doesn't mean the service should slack off.", 
            "we came here for lunch on a saturday.  i was craving a hamburger, so when i saw a hamburger on the menu, i was thrilled. \n\n<mark>The Burger</mark> comes with house cured pancetta and sweet gorgonzola and i added the garlic fries.  my burger was so good, it was cooked to my desired temperature and it was so juicy.  the garlic fries were ok.  i was expecting just that; fries!  but they are (possibly) baked fingerling potatoes with fries, parsley, and parm cheese- still i am not complaining, but i guess i was just in the mood for french fries and some added garlic sounded even better.\n\nmy boyfriend had the house-made pastrami.  ohh hell's yeah! very tasty but i liked my burger better.  my burger was fatty and delicious.  i was full the whole entire day.  so lady's, if you have a small stomach like mine and are planing on having dinner later on  have two bites because you will not be able to move after this massive beast-of-a-burger.  \n\nservice is great and the place i guess can be a bit expensive to some.  if you are looking for a cheap italian place, then skip this one because you will complain after you pay, no matter if the food was beyond excellet.", 
            "it was my first trip to vegas and my husband took me to carnevino for lunch! being in a hotel, the atmosphere of the restaurant is very nice and has a very warm feel to it! \nmy husband got <mark>The Burger</mark>, which was out of this world! it was juciy, thick and hearty.. like what a burger should be like. i got the linguini, which was not what i had expected it to be like. perhaps the spice of the sauce was overwhelming and lots and lots of carrots! but the linguini itself was very good! the texture was just right.. talk about al dente! if i got a diferent sauce, it would have been a 5 star!\n\nthe beef tartar with mushroom was also absolutely delish! i like my meat medium rare, but if you are going to eat a meat raw, it should really be at a place like carnevino where they know what they are doing and can make it taste... yummmm!\n\ni havent gone for dinner, but if you are looking for a nice dinner that you cant go wrong, make sure to stop by carnevino!", 
            "hard to beat late-night eats like this.  mario batali, steakhouse, cocktails, thank you and good night.\n\nlocated within the bowels of palazzo, we were happy to find that this is open until midnight, allowing us to get a (hopefully!) great bite to eat before continuing the night.\n\ntheir late night menu has a stripped down list of items to choose from - some quick hits like burgers, steak and eggs, and a selection of apps, salads and entrees.\n\nwe started with the <mark>Fried Calamari</mark>, lightly crispy and very tender.\n\ni had the steak and eggs - a nice cut of steak (medium-rare), eggs and a whole bunch of fingerling potatoes.  i was full and happy for it.\n\nmy buddy had <mark>The Burger</mark> with fries.  i've never seen him so happy to eat a burger.\n\nthey have a wide variety of italian beers (most of which i'd never seen before, even in fancy craft brew bars) and cocktails, like the honeyed ginger ale (wild turkey \"american honey\" bourbon liqueur, ginger beer, fresh ginger) - so gingery it hurt.  but in a good way.\n\n\nwould go back here in a second for any beef-related cravings.", 
            "the wife and i have been here on 3 occasions, 1 for dinner and 2 for lunch. as a steakhouse in las vegas, you know that it's going to be a little pricy. our dinner visit here was alright, but we really loved our 2 most recent visits for lunch. things are a little low key for lunch and you can just relax in the bar area and enjoy a good meal. for me <mark>The Burger</mark> or the mortadella sandwich were great options. the service at the bar is always attentive despite the bartender being the only one there to help. \n\nthe wife and i really like to hang out in the palazzo casino as it's bright and has high ceilings so you don't feel like your really in a casino. also the adjoining shops are great to visit. even for lunch, the prices can be steep a little, but at least the portions are good and remember, you are on the las vegas strip.", 
            "i recently went to carne vino for the third time, and it has gone very downhill. a group of 7 of us came right at the lunch opening of noon. first we had to wait as they couldn't open on time due to a health department review. second the waitress offered us only the dinner menu saying it was similar to the lunch menu (but it lacks the $25 very popular burger and other less expensive options). our table had to ask for the lunch menu twice before receiving it. next they were out of pesto, at lunch for an item on the lunch menu, and when i asked for other sauce options she told me to look at the menu and other sauces for other pastas instead of stating what sauces they currently had. after we ordered it took 40 minutes for <mark>The Burger</mark> to arrive and everyone's was overdone. overall my entire group was treated incredibly poorly for a uncrowded restaurant and spending over $250 on lunch. the service needs a serious adjustment."

            "this is the third mario battali place i have dined at. babbo and enoteca san marco being the other two- this was right on par with babbo!! the hostess was extremely nice without coming across as vegas cheesy- which happens alot.  wine list was above average but adnittedly, i am not up to speed on the italian wines. i decided to venture out and let the sommelier pick based on my likes for the table- he nailed it! dinner went like this:\nclams by the dozen\n\"al forno\" with pancetta and fresno chilies\n\"<mark>Zach's Chopped Salad</mark>\"\nbeans, pepperoncini, parmigiano\nricotta and egg raviolo\ndry aged bone in ribeye\n<mark>Bone-In New York Strip</mark>\n\"spago\" with lamb ragu\n\nthis was shared by 6 guys and we were stuffed afterwards! each dish was exceptional whether it was pasta or meat- which was cooked perfectly! the drizzle of olive oil on the steak was perfection as well. it was a little pricey compared to some other places- but worth every penny of it! will definitely revisit every trip to vegas- which is a minimum 4 times a year! big fan", 
            "if it wasn't for winning big in poker the night before, i would have ended up at delmonico instead of carnevino (where they nickel and dime you for everything.) from our experience at pizzeria mozza, i knew better to order a coke (for $5.) but i did not expect every sauce to be an additional $5. i understand a good steak doesn't need the frills of a sauce but i just thought it was funny even the lamb had an optional $5 mint sauce. another example of crazy costs is $22 appetizer pasta. that's right, pasta is an appetizer here, haha. it is an additional $15 to make it an entr\\u00e9e. whatever batali, you win. you're food is still fantastic. every bite of food perplexes the mind; even the bread (delicious) with peppered lard that turned out to be pretty good. highlights of the night:\n\n+ + (appetizer) black fettuccine with crab, jalapeno and shallots - wow, what an amazing dish\n+ (entr\\u00e9e) <mark>Bone-In New York Strip</mark>\n+ (side) <mark>Italian Broccoli with Garlic and Pork</mark> and hot peppers - if only the pork was its own dish, yum!\n\nnote: 20% off your tab after 10pm and make your reservations on opentable.com for points and ease. i changed our reservation 3 times that night since we were running late from love. also, don't worry too much about the \"business casual\" dress code. you're still on the casino floor for goodness sake. it's not that dressy.\n\nif and when i'm on a hot streak again, i'm taking my winnings to carnevino.", 
            "i wasn't sure what to expect at mario batalli's restaurant in the palazzo hotel and casino and this was going to be our big night out so our fingers were crossed that this would be good. our debit card had been suspended due to a shopping trip i had taken earlier to la perla (oops) so s was on the phone trying to tell bank of america that we were in fact in las vegas while i waited for him at the restaurant's entrance (they wouldn't seat us until we were both there). this wasn't a big deal because they offered prosciutto wrapped bread sticks which were delicious. when seated s remarked that there were only 4-tops in the restaurant which was fabulous for a party of two - you could stretch out while feeling cozy at the same time. the restaurant's atmosphere echo's its steakhouse vibe and i was surprised at how gigantic the restaurant really is. we were seated in the front room and only realized on a trip to the restroom that the place goes back quite far. upon sitting down, we were brought our immense menus and if i thought nobu's menu was confusing i was in for quite a time with this one. this menu isn't confusing so much as immense. it's physically quite large and our waiter explained that typical of italian dining you order an antipasti, a pasta and then a meat course. we dove right it. to start, i had the big eye tuna crudo and s had the dry aged beef carpaccio on arugula and both were delicious. for our pasta course, i ordered the ricotta and egg raviolo while s had the \"spago\" with lamb ragu. my plate was insane. one lone raviolo sat in a pool of brown butter and when you cut into it the egg underneath ran out and the cheese mixed with it and made just utter fabulous-ness all around. finally, the meat. up to this point we were impressed but given that this was a steak house, we were holding back all judgment until our final course. i ordered the <mark>Lamb Chops</mark> \"scottadita\" with a cumin scented yogurt sauce and s had the bone in <mark>Bone-In New York Strip</mark>. we were blown away. s said that his steak was amazing - with a nice char on the outside while the inside was perfectly pink. my <mark>Lamb Chops</mark> were delicious and had that gamey flavor that comes with good lamb. what struck us the most was that while this was a high end dining establishment, there was also a certain amount of casualness that made it comfortable. in this beautiful and dim dining room they were blasting the rolling stones. the sommelier was really approachable and  became like a good friend when he realized our interest in wine which was a nice touch as he recommended some great ones (which i sadly can't remember now). the wine list is incredible so if you like italian wines, go crazy. essentially, carnevino felt like mario batalli was in the kitchen cooking your dinner. no detail was overlooked and everything was incredible. i wish he'd open a restaurant in the bay area because that man knows italian food.", 
            "ate at carnevino on a wednesday night (december 15th) with four other adults. the meal and experience were excellent with the following exceptions. the prices were a bit high and the portion sizes smaller than at other high-end italian restaurants and steak houses. think of the place as a good-quality european restaurant and you won't be disappointed. if you expect the prices and serving sizes of a typical las vegas restaurant, you may be disappointed.\n\nhaving said that, we all agreed it was an exceptional and very enjoyable dinner (and one in our party is a formally trained chef.) we were not rushed; the food, drinks, desserts, wine and drinks were top notch as was the service. they have a sommelier who was very helpful without being \"snooty.\"\n\none warning - the excellent bread rolls are served both with containers of butter and a pork fat spread (? a traditional italian item.) the fat spread is a bit greasy and certainly an acquired taste.\n\nall of the pasta dishes we tried were excellent, especially the spago with lamp ragu. all of the pastas are priced as appetizer sized portions (for $15 - $30.) don't expect large servings but all were excellent. we ordered several and shared bites. for 15.00, any of the pastas can be ordered as an entr\\u00e9e. i had the puttanesca pasta (a favorite of mine.) it had clearly been under the heat lamp, so the surface was a bit dried and i had to stir it a bit. it was also under cooked and i almost sent it back. our resident chef said it was in acceptable limits, so i didn't.\n\ntwo in our party split the <mark>Bone-In New York Strip</mark> steak. at $54.00, it seemed overpriced, but it was extremely good - better than many other steak houses i go to (e.g. ruth's chris, eddie v's, etc.) we all shared two desserts - the apple fritters and maple panna cotta. both were excellent, as they should be at ~$16 per serving.\n\none final warning - all coffee is espresso based - so don't expect free refills. my request for \"decaf\" coffee was served as a decaf caf\\u00e9 americano. they have no pots of brewed coffee. an extra cup would have cost me an extra caf\\u00e9 americano.\n\nall in all, we had an excellent dinner. the serving sizes were adequate and expensive, but all in all worth it for a special occasion.", 
            "carnevino is mario batali's high-end steakhouse in las vegas (located in the palazzo).  with steakhouses, the first thing people want to know is if the steak is good.  the steak here was very good (some of the best i've had).  of course, a lot of these high-end steakhouses put out good quality steaks that are cooked to the appropriate temperature.  they tend to struggle with the other menu items though--the starters, sides and desserts.  unfortunately, carnevino is too similar to other steakhouses in that respect.\n\ncarnevino is huge and boisterous.  they keep the restaurant pretty dark.  the decor is nice and the seating is comfortable, but the overall look and design of the restaurant is nothing new (or impactful).  they do feature a large bronze bull statue at the front.\n\nthe complimentary bread included cheese puffs that were good.  i cannot remember what other bread was served, but it was at least okay.\n\ni started with the big eye tuna crudo, which featured tuna sashimi dressed in a vinaigrette with a side of radish and cucumber salad.  the tuna was fresh and good though it was a very small portion.  some of it was a little over salted.  the radish and cucumber salad was fresh and crisp.\n\nfor my pasta, i had the fruit di mare, which featured spaghetti with a tomato sauce, lobster, squid, shrimp, and clams.  the seafood was a generous portion.  i liked the lobster and the shrimp.  the squid was fine.  the clams were just okay; i've had better.  the clams here were not as meaty and tender as i would have liked.  there was a little bit of grit and sand in some of the shellfish though.\n\nthe tomato sauce had a little bit of heat to it, but it was quite thin, watery and bland.  the waiter said that all of their pastas were housemade, but the spaghetti did not taste like housemade spaghetti.  maybe it was, but i have had better housemade spaghetti at other restaurants.\n\ni tried my friend's pappardelle dish, which was served with mushrooms.  we both agreed that her pasta was a little bland.  the texture of the pasta was good though.  i was not a fan of the pastas at batali's osteria mozza (though the pastas there were not bland but salty).\n\nthe main course was good though.  i had a <mark>Bone-In New York Strip</mark> and it had a great char to it.  the inside was nicely medium rare.  it was juicy, flavorful and tender (which is hard to do with a <mark>Bone-In New York Strip</mark> because it is lean).\n\nthey also offer a dry aged bone-in ribeye for two people.  this ribeye gives new meaning to the word bone-in (check the photos on yelp to see what i mean).  the ribeye was huge and they carve it tableside.  the ribeye was very good--great marbling, juicy, flavorful, and tender (one of the best steaks i've had).\n\ni also sampled a little bit of the filet portion from the porterhouse.  this was my least favorite of the steaks.  maybe the filet was too thick because the center of it was kind of bland.\n\nthey offer sauces on the side and i tried their wine reduction (barolo ristretto), which was oily and had no flavor.\n\ni did not get to try many of the sides, but i did try their creamy mashed potatoes (mixed with mascarpone and a poached egg).  the mashed potatoes were very creamy and flavorful.  the other sides sounded good.\n\nit was my friend's birthday so carnevino made a big chocolate cake for the occasion.  the chocolate cake was rich and fudgy, but it was just okay.  we also had some of their gelato on the side (chocolate, vanilla and coffee).  the gelato was a little icy and lacked the creamy, smooth texture that is common with gelato.  the flavors were not that prominent as well.\n\nservice was good.  food came out at a good pace.  we were a large party, but they had a large and attentive staff supporting us.  before ordering at most restaurants, i engage the server to understand what are the most popular dishes and how are they prepared.  more often than not, i let the server direct me in what to order especially if i sense the server is passionate about the food.  here though, the waiter was a little pushy.  as soon as we sat down, he was directing us on what to order, how much we need to order and so forth.  service was still good, but the waiter was just not for me.\n\ncarnevino's meat was very good and unlike several las vegas restaurants i've dined at, i walked away satisfied.  prices here (like other vegas restaurants) were pretty steep, but at least i felt that the main food here (steak) would match up well with some of the other very good steak places i've tried, which makes carnevino a good las vegas option for steak lovers.\n\nby the way, my friends said they saw mario batali (he was eating with john cusack near the bar).\n\nthe palazzo has complimentary valet parking.  i would imagine like other major casinos that they have complimentary self-parking as well.", 
            "***carnevino is expensive, but the meat choices (like the <mark>Bone-In New York Strip</mark> and veals chops) as well as the grill octopus and lobster ravioli are very good***\n\nwhile i am not a big fan of las vegas restaurants, mario batali's carnevino definitely excels at putting out great meat dishes.  we had several of their meat offerings including the <mark>Bone-In New York Strip</mark> and the veal chop and both were very good.\n\nthe <mark>Bone-In New York Strip</mark> was a thick cut and it had a great crispy outside sear, which was flavorful.  the meat was very tender.  it was undercooked at rare, but it still had a good flavor (and was of course moist).\n\nthe veal chop was better.  it was also very thick, but it was cooked more appropriately.  veal chops should be between medium rare and medium and this one was.  the meat was moist and tender while the outside crust was distinct and flavorful.  veal can often be a tad bland, but this one had a good flavor.  this was probably the best veal chop i have ever had.\n\nthe <mark>Lamb Chops</mark> were just okay.  unlike the other meats, the <mark>Lamb Chops</mark> were not that thick.  they were a tad overcooked and while they did have a decent flavor and were tender, they were just not as juicy as they should have been.  also, the outside crust was not as good as the veal or the <mark>Bone-In New York Strip</mark>.\n\nwe had two other dishes that were also very good.  one was their <mark>Grilled Octopus</mark>.  i've heard batali's <mark>Grilled Octopus</mark> at osteria mozza is very good.  this one was exceptional.  the octopus was very soft (which can be difficult with octopus) and it had a great flavor.  there were some good pickled vegetables on the side and maybe something else like prosciutto to give it a nice savory flavor.\n\ni have not enjoyed many of batali's pastas, but i did like his lobster anolini.  the lobster filled ravioli was very good--moist with a great lobster flavor.  the cream sauce was mixed with tarragon and it was flavorful and fragrant without being overly buttery or rich.\n\nmost of the other items were in the just okay range.  the <mark>Arugula Salad</mark> featured a triple cream, but the triple cream was surprisingly dry and a little hard.  the bruschetta was okay (as was the big eye tuna crudo).\n\nwe had the pappardelle <mark>Italian Broccoli with Garlic and Pork</mark> mushrooms and while the pasta sheets were good, the pasta went cold quickly.  it was also a little bland.  i was expecting the braised pork agnolotti to have a more impactful filling, but it was not as moist or savory as i was hoping for.  the garnish of chanterelles was good though.  there was a little bit of <mark>Fregula, Pecorino Romano, Butternut Squash</mark> on the plate, but it did not provide the sweet flavor i was expecting.\n\nmost of the sides were just okay (like the spinach and the roasted beets), but the mashed potatoes with mascarpone and a poached egg were rich, creamy and quite good.\n\ni had the flourless chocolate cake for dessert and it was okay.  i am not the biggest fan of flourless chocolate cake because it can be too dry.  while it was a little bit dry, it had a good (but maybe not great) chocolate flavor.\n\nservice was good.  the staff was attentive and the food came out at a good pace.\n\nprices were high (which is common in las vegas), but when you share several of their dishes (family style), you might be able to save a little bit of money.\n\ncarnevino has very high ceilings and a loud atmosphere.  the place has the look of other expensive steakhouses--kind of masculine looking with lots of dark browns.\n\nthe meat at carnevino is very good and it is up there with some of the best a la carte steakhouses i've tried.  i am not the biggest fan of these steakhouses, but carnevino is one of the better ones and they even have a few other good things (like the lobster ravioli) to balance out the meal.\n\ncarnevino is located in the palazzo, which has free parking (valet or self).", 
            "best steak i've ever had.\n\nthat pretty much sums it up.  i was determined to try this mythical 6-9 month aged beef i had heard about, so we strolled in, got a side table, and managed to coax up a <mark>Bone-In New York Strip</mark> steak for two.  that wasn't quite what i was aiming for, but it turned out well.\n\ni can see how some people might complain that the \"ambiance\" isn't quite there, but i was so focused on my objective (eat the old steak) that it didn't matter to me at all.  and boy, did it pay off.\n\ni have to say, i was not really expecting what i got.  i don't run around looking for great steaks, and i usually dump worcestershire sauce on everything.  but that was not needed here.\n\nthe meat itself arrives and the first thing you notice is the waxy deep red color.  this is meat ... but meat that has *evolved* before hitting your plate.  the waxy look is not just for show either ... the beef is tender and suffused with the waxy texture as much as the look.  it was literally as if the fat had endeavored to permeate the fibers of the meat itself and succeeded.  the flavor was just slightly funky, but deep and textured.  it paired perfectly with vegetables.  post-bite, you could still feel the flavor seeping into your taste buds.  until you lifted your fork and did it all again.\n\ndefinitely call ahead to be sure they'll have the right aged meat ready for you and some better seats.  if you want to eat a meal you can talk about later, you will not be disappointed by coming here.", 
            "steak and wine! what else can i say! been to this place 2 times already and just sat at the bar..... i guess i like doing that!  this place is pretty expensive so i hope that you are going after a strong dice roll at the tables! we started with  the <mark>Grilled Octopus</mark> and the jamon plate... both were fantastic! we had a aperitif and then a glass of wine suggested by john the bartender. he also suggested a pasta before the steak, on one occasion we had the gnocchi and the other the raviolo which i thought the raviolo was much better.  we then had a masterpiece of steak slightly charred from a blazing oven, the dry aged bone in rib eye!  absolutely mouth watering tender  with that amazing char broiled flavor!   one of the best ive ever had , even though i was a little drunk by then! the next time we tried the filet and the <mark>Bone-In New York Strip</mark> .... both were good, but not the same as the rib eye. needless to say you will pay for the rib eye, but i would strongly suggest that if you were going to go there. our bartender with his salvador dali moustache was mixology at its finest making a perfect cocktail and keeping our wine glasses full. we even got to try a few unique different spirits on the house to try next time! well worth it and a fantastic place in vegas!", 
            "happy and fat. \n\nthe operative words that come to mind when i hear the name mario batali. sadly, the overpriced, lackluster fare at carnevino only made me the latter! but, as a disclaimer, it has been quite a while since my visit here, so hopefully they've made some improvements since then. \n\nlocated in the palazzo, carnevino semi-failed from the get-go. while it maintains the top-notch customer service and decadent, chic decor expected of a high-end vegas establishment, the ambience was marred by the raucous sound of beastie boys blarring from the stereo system. i'm not neccessarily opposed to them, but the likes of \"intergalatic\" and \"sabatoge\" didn't jive well with the up-scale environment.  \n\nthe menu was sneaky too. so, watch out! case in point, the prices listed for the pastas range from $17-$31; however, these are for appetizer portions only. an additional $15 needs to be tacked on for the entree size. also, the steak for two is listed as $72, but it's $72 per person, making it a whopping $144.  a steak legitimately worth that much wouldn't be for eating, as it should be plated in precious metals and embedded with swarvoski crystals.\n\nwe ended up ordering the bison carpaccio & <mark>Fried Calamari</mark> appetizers, 16-oz <mark>Bone-In New York Strip</mark>, grilled sweetbreads, & pork milanese. pretty much all the main courses failed, and for an establishment that boasts \"the highest-quality, excellently prepared steaks\" i was seriously expecting more than the the chewy, bland <mark>Bone-In New York Strip</mark> that was served. the appetizers were actually pretty good, and i'd recommend getting the bison capaccio. but other than that, the highlights of the meal were the complimentary cheese puffs & the bread w/butter & peppered lard. \n\nneedless to say, this was a sad way to start out our trip in vegas. luckily, our night of debauchery at xs later on that night made up for it. two stars!", 
            "i ate here the evening of october 8th.  after an extremely disappointing start, it was a very good dinner.  i dined with a party of five business associates.  we were shown to our seats and assured that the waiter would be over shortly, but we waited about 30 minutes for him to come over and take our drink orders.  we saw him taking other tables food orders, but i would think priority would be to put drinks in front of the guests.  who knows.  regardless once he finally came over with the wine, the experience was excellent.  we put our fate in his hands and let him pick the appetizers, main coarse and sides and don't think any of us could have done a better job on our own.\n\nhe brought us out the <mark>Bone-In New York Strip</mark> <mark>Italian Broccoli with Garlic and Pork</mark>, then cut it up for individual portions for the table.  the taste was amazing as was his selections for our sides.  the dinner was extremely expensive and we probably would not ordered the way we did if i wasn't on an expense account.", 
            "my lips quivered when i took the first bite from the 60 day aged <mark>Bone-In New York Strip</mark>. that's all i have to say about that.", 
            "one of the most unique steakhouses in vegas offering a rare culinary delight:  months aged dry aged beef.\n\nread on, i promise not to talk about what the process really is.\n\ncalled \"riserva\", the once usda prime beef is aged six to 11 months before being trimmed and served.  the result is unlike \"younger\", 30-75 day dry aged beef.  the shorter aged steaks retain a beefy texture, very tender with a pronounced nutty, bleu cheese aroma and flavor with a massive umame finish.  the months aged beef, think prosciutto.  broiled rare to mid rare at a low temperature.  there is no thick outer crust.  the flavor is mild and nutty with only the hint of bleu cheese aroma.  the beef is dense and oily.  it has a very different mouth feel.  it is extremely sweet.  amazing but not for everyone.\n\ntip:  request the \"riserva\" steaks when making reservation.  the amount of aging doesn't matter.  the piece is selected when it has reached the correct characteristics.\n\ntraditional dry aged steaks are excellent.  the rib eye <mark>Italian Broccoli with Garlic and Pork</mark> both possess the classic umame packed dry aged goodness.  excellent sear, tender and juicy.  both steaks are meant to be shared.  if dining alone, both the bone in <mark>Bone-In New York Strip</mark> and bone in <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> offer the same experience as the porterhouse in a more manageable 16oz portion.\n\nall steaks are rubbed with rosemary before cooking.  it imparts a strong, woodsy flavor that enhances the sweetness of the beef.\n\nnot into aged beef?  the 20oz bone in veal chop is excellent.  natural, pasture raised veal, it has a light beef flavor with a soft texture.  it's dry rubbed with thyme <mark>Italian Broccoli with Garlic and Pork</mark> powder that imparts a very flavorful earthy goodness.  a drizzle of fresh olive oil adds the perfect richness.\n\nfor starters, the <mark>Fried Calamari</mark>, \"shrimp alla diavola\", and bucatini amatriciana are excellent but why fill up.  you can get these at batali's italian eatery, b&b ristorante.\n\nthe restaurant captures the spirit of italy, an enjoyable, casual, jovial evening.  don't go with an elegant stick up your, you know.  the bread will make your hands oily and gnawing the bone is encouraged.\n\nbravo!", 
            "my first batali/bastianich experience and unfortunately it'll probably be my last. there's very little good i could find in my experience at carnevino. first, the service was horrendous. after ordering a bottle of wine, the waiter poured us a glass, then took the bottle away from the table where we were left waiting 20-25 minutes for someone to bring it back to fill up an empty glass. we also had to ask for a basket of bread after realizing all the other tables except ours received one upon arriving. \n\nfood:\n\ntagliatelle <mark>Italian Broccoli with Garlic and Pork</mark> trifolati: sauce was decent, pasta was overcooked. in a restaurant that's owned by these 2? weird.\n\ngrilled sweetbreads: saved this place from getting 1 star. this dish was awesome. if you find yourself here and you like sweetbreads i'd highly recommend them. \n\n16 oz <mark>Bone-In New York Strip</mark>:  four people at our table ordered it medium rare and they all came cooked a different way. truly surprising and really unacceptable. one of the steaks felt and tasted like it had been sitting for at least 30 minutes. when we brought the inedible steak up to the waiter he didn't even blink when telling us we wouldn't be charged for it. the impression i got was that it happens all the time.\n\nin a place like vegas where every world-class chef has at least one restaurant i would absolutely go somewhere else. i guess you could chalk my story up to \"a bad night\" but it really was dreadful. i expected better from batali and bastianich.", 
            "hmmmm, more like 3.5, but i'm rounding up to 4 stars because the service was absolutely fantastic. when my sister and i came in here, we weren't sure what to expect. we were following our \"when in vegas, go all in\" mantra so we decided to splurge on some batali fare. i had the <mark>Bone-In New York Strip</mark> on the bone and my sister had duck. both items were absolutely delicious. nevertheless, we couldn't help but feel as if we might have overpaid for our meals. to royalty, corporate and inheritance snobs, this meal might just cost chump change. not necessarily the case for us east la cats. however, the service that we got from the staff was top notch and then some, so it made our visit quite comfortable. will we be back? probably not, unless we win the lottery. but it was a hell of a meal and experience.",

            "disclaimer: i am not a very discerning steak person, so my palette may not be at the caliber necessary to appreciate good meat.\n\nthis was my first experience trying dry aged meat, and i did so on recommendation of the server.  i ordered the dry aged <mark>Bone-In New York Strip</mark> because my friend didn't want to share the bone in ribeye with me.  it was flavorful enough not to require sauce, but wasn't anything special to me.  it's supposedly dry aged for three months or something, but that's definitely not necessary.\n\nfor the sides, we ordered the mashed potatoes, which featured a poached egg!  that's the first time i've had mashed potatoes prepared in that way, but it was so delicious! definitely a must have.\n\nthe service was a little weird.  we ordered two glasses of wine, but enjoyed the wine so much we wanted the bottle.  our server forgot about this and didn't come back to refill our glasses for most of the meal, so we ended up having to basically chug the rest of the wine.  also, he crumbed our table with a spoon.  is that normal?  another thing was that we ordered flat water, which the busser confirmed when first refilling our glasses.  however, the second time he came around, he gave us sparkling water.  \n\ni wouldn't return to carnevino, as i don't think the meal was worth the price, especially with the service shortfalls.  i think many people agree with me, as the restaurant was empty at 7:00 p.m. on a monday night.", 
            "we had a beautiful dinner, <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> and the <mark>Bone-In New York Strip</mark> steak...with mashed potatoes and italian broccoli...to die for!! i recommend a nice glass of reisling with your meal. be prepared to spend a pretty penny, but totally worth it :)", 
            "i will cut carnevino a bit of slack because we visited them\nvery very late and probably ate one of their last meals of the night. we opted for the dry aged <mark>Bone-In New York Strip</mark> at the recommendation of the bartender. we ordered them medium. my boyfriend's steak was perfection, however mine tasted a bit overdone due to a crispy charcoal-like outer covering. atmosphere was nice but for the price, i was pretty disappointed.", 
            "i was staying at the venetian for a work conference and we're going through a late night dry-run with a couple colleagues when we got hungry around 8:30pm. we really wanted some steak and stopped by cut(?) first however their wait was 45 minutes. we called the concierge to see what our other options were for steak with a shorter wait time and she recommended carnevino. so off we went.\n\nthe restaurant itself is located away from restaurant row and through the casino in the palazzo. it had a nice ambiance, dim lighting and quite intimate with racks of their great wine selection on the walls. we grabbed a couple drinks while waiting to be seated and i got a moscow mule which was ok.\n\nonce seated we ordered the <mark>Fried Calamari</mark> which was pretty good. they brought out bread with two sides of butter <mark>Italian Broccoli with Garlic and Pork</mark> fat which they recommended mixing together before spreading it on the bread and oh my god it was delish. i mean pork fat and butter? c'mon. they also gave us complimentary mini bread rolls with cheese inside and it pretty much tasted like a crispy cheese ball which is amazing.\n\na colleague and i ordered the dry aged bone-in ribeye which has the option on menu to split between two for $72 each. we were unsure until our waiter told us this particular dish was in the running for the best steak in the country. so we pretty much were validated in our reasoning for getting it lol. another colleague got the <mark>Bone-In New York Strip</mark>. we also got the charred brussels sprouts and the saut\\u00e9ed mushrooms. \n\nthe waiters (yes, more than one) came and rolled out a table with the bone-in ribeye and holy mother of god was this thing huge. i mean i'm all of 5'1 and it could've knocked me out. they cut the entire dish in front of us and served it neatly sliced on our plates and then placed the bone in the middle of the table. ok time for the big taste...simply put it was the best steak i've ever had in my life. i mean perfectly seasoned and moist and melt in your mouth goodness. after getting over the massive bone just chillin on the table i savored every bite. the brussels sprouts were pretty good but i thought the mushrooms were very good. \n\nin addition i have to say what really gave my review the full five stars was the exceptional service. working in a field that pretty much values service i mean they were very at tentative. they took the time to explain everything to us, make sure we were comfortable, and checked on us regularly - even making sure to fold our napkins of we went to the bathroom. \n\ni had a really great experience here. good food, good company, good service. i left full and satisfied and honestly i would recommend this place if you are looking for a really great steak that you definitely don't mind splurging on.", 
            "i had the dry aged <mark>Bone-In New York Strip</mark> and it was amazing! the steak was cooked to perfection. we also had the charged peppers. they are oaky , i don't think i would get them again. all the other apps and sides we had where good but the steak was the main star here and the reason i'm giving the stars i did.", 
            "very fine italian steakhouse. went with industry collagues and did a 3-course tasting. just... delicious.\n\ncan't tell you everything, but we did have <mark>Fried Calamari</mark>, dry aged beef tortellini, some other pasta and sliced meat with these little bread rolls you wrapped the meat around, and the meat included the chop, dry aged bone-in ribeye, <mark>Filet Mignon</mark>, and dry aged <mark>Bone-In New York Strip</mark>. i'd say the temp came in just a hair over medium-rare, but all in all... fantastic meal.\n\nalso had the chocolate & peanut butter torte for dessert. heaven.\n\nyou won't be disappointed.", 
            "my husband and i had a lovely first night here. our waiter was kind of enough to suggest that we split the salad, pasta, and steak entree so that we both can share and try everything. the <mark>Arugula Salad</mark> with goat cheese was great. we had the special pasta beef cheek ravioli which was fantastic. finally, the dry-aged <mark>Bone-In New York Strip</mark> was excellent and wasn't gamey at all. they have a nice selection of sauces to go with your steak. definitely, will eat here again on our next visit to vegas!",

            "it was worth every penny. the ambience was excellent (for the main side which we were on) caprese was delcious, our tasting portion of the sausage orchiette was perfectly al dente, my osso bucco was very good and my girlfriends <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> was fantastic (even for medium-well). i think that since this is a celebrity chef restaurant inside of one of the top 3 hotels on the vegas strip, the prices could have been higher! honestly! yes it is all al a carte, but the sides are only $9 when they could be $12 like other steakhouses. the petite filet was about $10 less than it is at other steakhouses, i think its one of the best bargain celebrity upscale restaurants in vegas.", 
            "on our last trip to vegas my friend and i had seen carnevino on our way to table 10 and after a quick glimpse of the menu had made it a point to visit on our next trip.\n\non a recent long weekend we decided to hit up carnevino on saturday night. so much on the menu looked tempting but we both ended up opting for the 8 oz. <mark>Filet Mignon</mark>. to compliment our steaks we chose two sauces, myself choosing the porcini bernaise which was the perfect accompaniment to my tender and scrumptious steak. the steak was juicy and cooked perfectly! the sauce was not a thick consistency, i would liken it to a thicker au jus. for our sides we chose the <mark>Tuscan Fries</mark>- made with fingerling potatoes roasted with parmesan and herbs and parmesan/potato cakes (i can't remember their name!)- mashed potatoes mixed with parmesan cheese and deep fried into a small yummy cake. so good!\n\nafter dinner we were full! but my friend wanted to see if they had an olive oil gelato she had had in batali's ny restaurant. to her dismay they didn't. however, we asked our server (rather our server's assistant) and he took the extra step and put our request into the chef. to our surprise the chef accomodated our request! a few minutes later our server brought out our olive oil gelato. what yummy goodness! smooth and sweet vanilla gelato, light and fruity olive oil and crushed sea salt. an unusual combination but so delicious! a must try! \n\nour dinner overall was a great dining experience. the service was professional, friendly, attentive and courteous. the food was brought out timely, hot and delicious! the fact that one of our servers made a special request and was able to deliver just made the dinner that much more enjoyable and the reason i gave this review 5 stars!", 
            "$65 per person to share one ribeye?  yes you read that correctly.  we had our annual guys trip to vegas and we always try to visit a different steak house every time we visit.  this year was carnevino.  we were surprised in order to order a ribeye or porterhouse, two people had to order it.  we found it a bit odd but we had no problems with it.   we found it even more odd the waiter suggested we have the steaks family style (they cut up the meat and put it on a plate for people to share).   anyways, a bunch us order different cuts of meat.  ny strip, <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> and the folks that wanted porterhouse or ribeye's paired up.   so when the steaks finally arrived, i got my ny strip and the folks that got the ribeye or porterhouse had to share one steak for two people!?!!?  wtf?  the size of the steak was a serving for one at any other steakhouse (cut, delmonico's,  boa).   we felt basically we were paying $130 for one ribeye.   the meat was definitely tasty but not outstanding where they can charge double the price.   let's just say we'll never come back to carnevino when we hit vegas again.  we'll go back to demonico's.", 
            "my friends and i spent another wonderful evening at carnevino during our last trip to vegas.  we made last minute reservations for 12 people.  the restaurant is big enough to accommodate large groups.  it's a bit of a maze, so pay attention when you walk all the way to the back of the restaurant.  the staff was once again very knowledgeable about the food and made suggestions accordingly.  they didn't offer sangria, but the waiter suggested a sangiovese mixed drink that tasted like crushed strawberries.  it was so refreshing and hit the spot.  i tried the veal saltimbocca & bacon-wrapped asparagus.  the veal was salty as it should be.  the asparagus was perfectly breaded, crunchy, and crisp.  my friends ordered the <mark>Lamb Chops</mark> with <mark>Mint Pesto</mark>, osso bucco, beef carpaccio, seafood spaghetti, la fiorentina, and the <mark>Filet Mignon</mark>.  all of the dishes were delicious.  one of my friends ordered the caprese salad to start and we were delighted that the mozzarella was freshly hand-pulled and creamy.  the combination of tomato, basil, and mozzarella was divine!  another great experience in las vegas.", 
            "went here for my 22nd birthday dinner with four friends. we were excited for a night of las vegas's magical cuisine. this place really delivers!\n\nthe waiter were so knowledgeable about everything being placed on the table, in or around us. it almost became to much, when explaining specials, their presentation, and suggestions they were very long winded. i guess i felt like when deep in conversation with close friends, give us some space. but really, i'd rather have a wait staff over doing it than under doing it, so i can't complain too much.\n\nthe restaurant is huge with really expensive looking art and furniture. dark toned brown leathers it felt grand. deep red paint covered most of the walls and creme linens lined the tables. i felt comfortable with the table set up and comfy chairs. it was exactly how i imagined dinner with tony soprano would be like. this italian steakhouse made sparks fly for me. \n\nfor entrees i got the beef carpaccio and the <mark>Fried Calamari</mark>. everyone enjoyed those tasty dishes. i ordered the <mark>Filet Mignon</mark>, the waiter said it was hormone and antibiotic free, sounds even better i'll take it. when my filet finally came out i was starving, i didn't wanna fill up too much on the super bread! oh heaven's me, i was on cloud nine. it was perfectly seasoned with their own blend of sea salt, pepper, and rosemary. i will always come back.", 
            "what high end restaurant does not serve chardonnay by the glass? i will tell you....it is below sub par joint that lacks quality, service, and experience. \n\nfrom the moment we walked to the host stand i was skeptical. the hostesses were paying more attention to what they were planning to do that evening than getting us a table. once seated, we noticed that the air conditioning was blowing like a gale wind. when asked if we could move tables, our waitress said it would be like that for every table but that she would get the manager and see if he could turn down the air. while we waited for the hurricane winds to subside we ordered a couple martinis and one of our guests ordered a glass of chardonnay. the waitress then informed her that they did not have chardonnay by the glass but that they had bottles from $110 and up. once explained that she did not need a bottle since she was the only one out of our group having chardonnay, the waitress asked if she would like to try any of their other whites by the glass. after trying about 10 different wines, none of which were anything comparable to chardonnay, she went with the least offensive. after the chardonnay charade, we all noticed that it el vino's winds were still a blowing. we asked to see a manager and once graced with his presence (15 minutes later) told him the situation. he apologized but explained that the casino controlled the air. so why were we told that they were turning the air down? by now we were just ready to order some food and hoped it would save the evening. \n\ndinner breakdown: \n\nmy mom: \nspaghetti ai frutti di mare - pasta tasted very good but did not stay hot long. the size of the pasta was very small and should have been listed as an antipasti. \n\nmy girlfriend: \n<mark>Filet Mignon</mark> 8oz - she like the taste of filet very much and said it was cooked perfectly. \n\nmy father and i: \nla fiorentina(classic florentine porterhouse) - the steak was a very good size, definitely was not worth $140. looked hot when it arrived but after the waiter was done carving the meat, the heat had succumbed to el vino. the meat was cold, chewy, and for the most part flavorless. \n\nneedless to say, we did not have coffee or dessert. i have done two of mario batali's restaurants and will not be visiting another. check out my b&b review coming soon. i will be posting it as soon as i get over the exhaustion of this review.\n\ni will say that in no way was this our waitresses fault and she did great for what she had to work with.  bravo! gets you 1 star.", 
            "location: in venetian/palazzo walkway.  we stayed at the venetian in a suite, b&b was already taken, so we went to the other mario batali restaurant in the hotel.\n\nfood: we had a party of 9.  ribeye (each order is for 2 people at 65 per person, ny strip, <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> ($40), <mark>Lamb Chops</mark>)  for sides we got the spinach with garlic & hot peppers, sauteed mixed mushrooms with cipollini onions, mascarpone & guanciale mashed potatoes (sorry for the caps, i copy/pasted from the website, forgot what the sides were called and what was included).  each side is for a portion for 2 ppl to share, so we got 2 orders of each of the previous sides.  each of the sides were recommended by the waiter.  personally i liked the mushroom with cipollini onions the best, the onions were absolutely amazing.  as for the entrees, noone was dissapointed.  i heard \"best <mark>Lamb Chops</mark> ever\".  the rib eye had insane marbling, and was cooked to perfection.  the cv steak sauce that we got with the steaks tasted like a vinegrette based with rosemary and other herbs infused.  ive had better steak sauce before.  also the ribeye comes with a massive bone, which they give to you.  on it has meat as well, the meat was very good, with a beef jerky like flavor but obviously much more delicious.\n\nprice: for the party of 9, and 6 sides with a bottle of wine, 1 appetizer (cured meats), no dessert.  comes out to be about 100/person.  almost a thousand total.  kind of pricey, but noone complained about it being overpriced, meaning they all thought they got their moneys worth.\n\nservice: excellent. period.\n\noverall: great food, sides could use improving, but the entrees more than makes up for it.  the quality of the ribeye is probably the best ive ever had.  if the sides were up to par, it would easily get 5 stars.", 
            "we were here for christmas eve.  i wish i remembered the name of our waiter, as i really enjoyed him, but unfortunately i forget his name.  we each did the prix fix meal at $49 a person that included a salad, 8 oz <mark>Filet Mignon</mark>, and dessert.  we then added in two pasta dishes and their version of steak frites.  we had a $108 bottle of wine and i had a cocktail.  grand total = $300.  not too bad as it was a lot of food and very tasty.  \n\naside from the steaks and salad, we tried the black fettucini which was awesome - odd combo (black pasta, jalapeno's, crab, caramelized shallots) and a special lobster ravioli.  the lobster ravioli's were good but not my favorite - i just would not try them again and out of everything we had that night i liked them the least.  the steak frites were amazing.  i know, i know.... just potatoes but really garlicky and salty.... mmmm.  dessert was caramel gelato for me - which was not too sweet and a nice way to end the meal.  the boyfriend had the apple sorbet.\n\ni think some of the complaints about this restaurant taking too long are from people that don't go to \"nice\" restaurants very often.  anytime you go to a fancier restaurant, expect your dinner to last about 2 hours.\n\nonly thing we decided we weren't that enthusiastic about was the fact this place was so close to the casino floor.  didn't really like eating my meal with the sound of slot machines in the background or watching over the casino floor.", 
            "freakin' good!  maybe it's what people order or when we go, but we weren't disappointed with a thing.  started off with the focaccia bread that they pass around, nice and hot.  we shared the <mark>Zach's Chopped Salad</mark>, it had the right amount spice with chopped jalapenos, crisp romaine, shaved and chopped parmesan cheese.  one salad was enough to share between two people.  i had the black fettucini with crab, jalapenos and a garlic like sauce.  i wasn't spicy, but the flavors blended very nicely.  he ordered the <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> with the crab bernaise sauce on top.  he said it was one of the best steaks he has eaten ever.  we shared the mashed potatoes side dish.  ohhhhh, so good.  mashed potatoes with marscapone cheese and a soft cooked egg, a little bacon, stirred together and it was like eating heaven.  for dessert we shared cookies for one and espresso gelato.  a great finish to a fantastic meal.\n\nwe did see a lot of people ordering the ribeye, but the filet looked ten times better.", 
            "fantastic place!  my wife and i went here for valentines dinner.  everything was great and the prices weren't so ridiculous...about what i thought i would pay and they also gave us a 15% locals discount!  on a sunday night!!  awesome.  \n\nstarted w/ the steak tartare...my wife and i loved it.  we've been to some places w/ great tartare like craftsteak but this was done in a really unique way.  whatever olive oil they used to mix is really brought out the flavor in the whole thing.  each bite was great and i could've eaten that as an entree.\n\nwe decided to split a small pasta course and got the ricotta and egg ravioli w/ some brown butter sauce on top.  $21...for one ravioli!!  but it was one damn good ravioli..perhaps the best i've ever had...maybe i just tried to convince myself of this due to the obscene price though...\n\nmy wife is a <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> woman all the way and if that's what she wants for v-day..that's what she's gonna get.  even though i was dying for the ribeye for 2.  i was thinking how wrong it would've been had i just ordered a ribeye for 2 for myself.  what a pig i would've been hahaha.  most tables around us got it and it looked so friggin good.  i also got the filet since i'm not into paying a lot for ny strip.  \n\nthe filet was incredible.  i'm not sure how this steak was prepped or aged or whatever but it was very clear that the quality was very high.  there was a unique kind of tenderness to the filet unlike any other i've had.  \n\ni'm going back and i'm getting the ribeye for 2 next time.  no question about it.", 
            "i've been here on three separate occasions and every time i come here, it seems to get better and better. the way i seem to think of this place is that its simply prepared food but done right. its probably not the most accurate description but by this i mean that its not too many different flavors or seasoning added to food yet its simple ingredients such as salt and pepper used to draw out the natural flavors of the steaks and other meals. \nthe wine list is pretty decent and the sommelier seems pretty knowledgeable. the last time we were here the sommelier recommended a bottle of french cru for us, something us loyal napa valley wine drinkers would rarely do. we liked it a lot though so we'd have to say he made a good choice. good overall service here as well. we've never had to wait too long for anything and always feel pretty well taken care of here. \none of my absolute favorite dishes i've had here and had anywhere in recent memory is the steak carpaccio. to be honest, i'm not exactly sure what it is, perhaps some type of raw meat so maybe its better i don't know. but all i know is it was really good! i'd definitely recommend it. \ni almost always order <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> at steakhouses and carnevino is no exception. i get medium, no blood, probably more overcooked than a true meat eater prefers but i think the steak is perfect here. not over seasoned, just done right. a definite must is their mashed potatoes for the side dish. i'm not sure of the name of it but its the potato dish where they add an egg to it at your table. it's probably raised my cholesterol level but it's worth it! \nthe only weak point i've noticed about this restaurant is the desserts. however, i'm usually pretty full by the dessert anyway so it doesn't bother me too much but it is a bit of a let down. i specifically remember the panna cotta and some sort of date cake and both were merely okay and paled in comparison to the rest of the meal. the desserts are a little too bland for me. however, i don't think i can fathom deducting a star for that since the rest of the meal more than makes up for it.", 
            "i had an excellent meal there on my birthday.  the restaurant is located in the palazza hotel, and i made a reservation the same day and received it with no difficulty.  the restaurant is one of mario batali's restaurants, and it is an italian steakhouse.  outside of the restaurant they are selling some mario batali books.  my party and i got there early and wouldn't let us in earlier than our reserved time, but whatever.  \n\nthe ambiance is dark and understated.  there is a large bronze cow sculpture inside.  we sat in a room that had shelves built into the walls holding wine.  the menu is gigantic and very long, but only because the first page has all the food items while the rest detail their many wines they serve.  they also serve some signature cocktails, but didn't try any.  \n\nthe bread was warm and tasted like ciabatta with rosemary.  there is a dedicated bread person who distributes hot bread to everyone one at a time.  there is european butter and aged lard to accompany your bread.  the bread server explained how the lard is actually lower in saturated fat than butter.  the lard was tastier than the butter.  \n\nwe got the dry aged bone in ribeye which says it serves 2, but that would be 2 very hungry carnivores.  the waiter assured us it would feed 3 and said it would take about 20 minutes.  we also ordered veal scallopine, black fettucine as a main dish, and spinach and mashed potatoes as sides all to share.  \n\nthe black fettucine dish has jalopenos, shallots and crab.  it was excellent.  i have no idea what was in the fettucine to make it black.  it didn't have a lot of crab.  it was kind of small considering we ordered it as a main dish.  \n\nthey bring out the steak and the manager sliced it for us and wished me a happy birthday.  the steak is drizzled in olive oil, and she strategically places the sliced meat in a tepee formation to keep the inner pieces of <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> hot while the t bone pieces are on the outside.  she also saves the bone and says the best meat is around the bone.  the outside of the steak has some kind of seasoning which is good.  \n\ni don't know how they can have two different cuts of meat on one steak, but both were amazing.  first there was the tougher pieces of t bone or ribeye, can't remember, and then there were the super tender pieces of <mark>Filet Mignon</mark>.  we ordered it medium well, but it still came out kind of pink.  the waiter warned us to order one category more done than what we are typically used to at other steak restaurants.  \n\nthe veal scallopine was excellent as well.  the sauce and mushrooms on there were tasty.  the mashed potatoes with marscapone and guanciale was served with a poached egg on top which the waiter asked if we wanted mashed into the potatoes.  it was so good and the hot potatoes cooked the egg and added a richness to it.  the spinach with garlic and peppers side was pretty typical and nothing special.  the sides were $9 each and served in small skillets.  each side would be sufficient to feed 2 or more people.   \n\nthere are many different sauces you can order for $5.  we didn't try any, but looking back that might have been a nice option.  \n\nwe were all completely stuffed by the end and actually left a little bit of veal that no one could eat.  they had a dessert menu with everything for $12.  none of them personally appealed to me so i skipped it.  great place to go to to splurge for a special occasion.", 
            "the pre-theatre prix fixe menu is a great deal! for $46, i got the calamari fritti (not too battered or fried, it sits in a spicy tomato sauce), the 8 oz. <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> (cooked to perfection and seasoned very nicely) and a trio of gelato. you order your side dishes ala carte so we had the mashed potatoes (soooooo rich and creamy!) they do it with mascarpone cheese and a little pork belly and then mix in a poached egg at your table. a-mazing! one of the best versions of mashed potatoes i've ever had.  we also had the brocolini, which also had a little pork belly. it was also pretty nice.  my eye was wandering toward the pasta but after our server told us that they are known for their steaks, i had to indulge and it was worth it!  the food here is definitely very rich, i feel like i after eating here too many times my physique would start looking like that of chef batali's. but all in all, a very nice meal.  good meat and good wine!", 
            "okay, i am a huge of mario batali. he just seems like a fun guy to hang around... so, when the opportunity arose for a chance to go to one of his restaurants, i jumped at it!\n\nbefore going, i reserved a table online from the restaurant's website. as far as wait time, i can not comment. when it came to seating, we were not seated a minute before our time... this kind of peeved me a little bit, but not enought to ding the entire experience. they did, however, seat us on time... i was just getting excited and wanted to be seated early. \n\non to the food: we ordered off the pre-theater menu. it was $49 each for a three-course meal. the menu offered 2 or 3 items to choose from for each course. pre-ordering, the chef does bring out little nibblets... that night it was some cheese ball. very tasty, it was. \n\ni had ordered the <mark>Insalata Romana</mark>, <mark>Filet Mignon</mark>, and vanilla bean gelato. the filet does not come with a side, everything is a la cart... so i ordered a side of mascarpone & guanciale mashed potatoes. \n\nthe salad was actually stacked kind of like an iceberg wedge, but with slivers of radichio inbetween every couple layers of romaine lettuce. on top, was a large crouton with an anchovy laying on top. the dressing was well balanced, not too salty or oily from the anchovy, nor was the garlic too over-powering. \n\nthe filet (i ordered medium-rare) was cooked perfectly. cool center, red throughout, and browned exterior with a single set of score lines on top and bottom. it was seasoned nicely and felt well balanced with the salt to meat ratio.\n\nthe mascarpone & guanciale mashed potatoes created a very hearty dish. it came out in a little skillet and was very hot (temp). let this guy cool down for a bit before attacking it. it did have an egg on top that the waiter mixed into the dish before handing the fork over to me. the dish was very rich and creamy from the mascarpone. the guanciale (italian bacon) was tasty and provided little bacon morsels to find and i ate. it was fun finding those little bits... remember folks, bacon is a major food group!\n\nthe gelato felt more crisp than the street vendors. i wouldn't say that it was as creamy as you can get elsewhere, but the flavor was particularly crisp. i enjoyed it.\n\ni know it has floated down the board that you can get lardo for a spread on your ciabatta. yes, you can. i tried it and was pleasantly surprised at the texture. it was like eating a spoonful of mayonaise and slowly drags down your tongue. it was seasoned with parmesan and rosemary and therefore tasted great. don't be scared to try it folks!!\n\ni know this is a really long review, but i'm almost done! the finale is the wine selection. for those that followed the tv show \"master chef\", chef joe (one of the judges) is mario's partner for this restaurant. he has his own private label of wine called bastianich (sp??). try the bianco vespa, it was a truly wonderful white-wine blend. \n\nwould i go back? yes, in a heartbeat i would.", 
            "loved, loved, loved  carnevino!\n\nevery time my fianc\\u00e9 and i take a trip to vegas we have at least 1 nice/romantic dinner that's different from the buffet and cafe dining. during our recent labor day trip we chose to eat at carnevino.  there were so many restaurants on our list but this was recommended by a friend so we decided to give it a try and i'm glad we did!\n\ntrue, this place is a bit on the pricey side but you get what you pay for. from the moment you walk in, you feel different. classy. elegant. important.  our waiter was well spoken, offered nice recommendations, and humorous. i give their service 5 stars.\n\nwe started the evening with a magnum bottle of champagne. yes, magnum. a regular bottle just wasn't enough. haha\n\n-------------------------\nhere's what we ordered:\n\n* appetizer\n<mark>Fried Calamari</mark> = 5 stars\nmarinara and pickled hot peppers\n\n* entree\nveal scaloppine = 4 stars\nporcini and marsala\n\n<mark>Filet Mignon</mark> = 5 stars\n\n* sides\nmascarpone & guanciale mashed potatoes = 5 stars\n\nsauteed mixed mushrooms with spring onion = 4 stars\n\n* dessert\nmarket napoleon tart = 5 stars\nricotta cream & candied pistachios\n-------------------------\n\nmy favorite part of the meal was the mashed potatoes and i'm always about the meat, or so i thought.  they break a poached egg into the mashed potatoes upon serving. it was absolutely divine!\n\ni ordered the <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> cooked medium and that's exactly what i got.  i usually get a sauce on top but it doesn't always satisfy so i opted for no sauce and loved it.  the flavor of the meat really came through and the steak was juicy in every bite.\n\nthe sides are ordered \\u00e0 la carte, much like other steakhouses.  they are priced reasonably at $9 each.\n\nthe dessert really surprised me.  it certainly wasn't a contender upon reading the menu, even though i love ricotta.  our waiter highly recommended it and described it with such passion that i could almost taste it. we had to try it!  it is not what you expect in a \"tart\" so you should try for yourself.\n\nour total bill was just under $275 (including tax and gratuity).  it was worth every penny, from the ambiance to the food to the service.", 
            "okay - i hate to do this - but i can only give carnevino a three star rating. now, maybe i just had an off day, since everyone and their mother loves this place, but i did not love my meal. \n\nwe first started off with <mark>Fried Calamari</mark> and potato gnocchi bolognese to share. the calamari was good (not out of this world) and the gnocchis were a bit on the hard side. not what i expected. i am sure they were homemade, however they needed to be cooked just a tad bit more. \n\nfor my meal, i had the <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> and our table shared a number of different sides. as far as the filet is concerned, i asked for it to be medium rare and it was just plain old rare. so rare that i couldn't really eat it. i should have sent it back to be cooked a bit longer (my fault), however i didn't want to be \"that\" girl at the table. \n\nas far as the sides are concerned, the <mark>Fregula, Pecorino Romano, Butternut Squash</mark> dish was delicious. the spinach was a bit on the salty side. the mushrooms were a bit overcooked, they were just a little bit too crispy. \n\nthe dessert however was very good. we had the lemon cheesecake, assorted cookies, butter cream crepes and something else that i can't remember. my favorite would have to be the assorted cookies.\n\nas far as the staff is concerned, everyone was extremely friendly and attentive.", 
            "i came here recently for a business dinner. the service is phenomenal. knowledgable about everything on the menu, including the individual farms all the produce came from. when served, it was perfectly choreographed so everyone at the table received their food at the same time.\n\nok on to the food. i started with the caprese salad which was the best i've ever had. the mozzarella just melted in my mouth. the starter bread was fantastic, crusty on the outside but soft and warm on the inside. it came with a soft butter and i thought whipped olive oil, which turned out to be lardo (lard or back fat) - which tastes good but this non meat eater had to put it down. the roast chicken was good, not outstanding but good. mashed potatoes were ok but the mushrooms were delish. others at my table got the <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> with shaved truffles an they all said it was the best steak they've ever had. \n\ndessert was a trio of sorbet, again good but nothing special. \n\noverall the experience was fantastic and decor was romantic. the food was good but a bit inconsistent. i would go again just for the service and to try the pasta, which i was admiring on another table. it's a bit expensive for what you get.", 
            "the first time i went to carnevino (last year) it was one of the best meals i've ever had. this time around the experience fell short.\n\nto start we ordered the <mark>Fried Calamari</mark> and the big eye tuna crudo. the calamari was excellent and the hot peppers in the dish added a good amount of heat without dominating the flavor. the tuna came with approximately eight small slices and were arranged in order of leanest to fattiest. all were delicious, especially the fatty ones. just don't expect large chunks of fish to come out if you order this dish.\n\nnext up was the black fettucine. served as a small portion, this is meant to be the equivalent of an appetizer. it sounded good when our waiter recommended it, because it came with crab, jalape\\u00f1os, and shallots. but the dish just didn't deliver. there wasn't much crab to speak of and the taste and overly-firm texture of the pasta was a turn off.\n\nfor our entrees, both couples ordered the dry aged bone-in ribeye for two. at $65 per person, it wasn't cheap but if was more than enough meat for all of us. they wheel it out on a cart and slice it tableside. the dish is finished with a touch of sea salt and olive oil. our ribeye was a slightly bloody medium rare as we ordered and absolutely delicious. they also leave the bone on the table which was one of the best parts of the meal. i wasn't going to be shy about trying it either. i picked it up and gnawed on it for a while, cleaning off all the meat i could. and, i have to say that the meat from the bone was the most flavorful and memorable bites of the night. as good as that steak was however, i prefer the ribeye at cut to this one. not only is it cheaper (per person), but the smaller and thinner cut of beef allowed for more seasoning and more of the crust on each bite.\n\nour sides were the sauteed mixed mushrooms with spring onions, brussels sprouts with pancetta, and a <mark>Fregula, Pecorino Romano, Butternut Squash</mark> dish with pine nuts and capers. all were amazing and the brussels sprouts were some of the best i've ever had.\n\nso, while i still think carnevino is an excellent restaurant, i would recommend it for the appetizers and sides (you can't go wrong with any of the ones we tried) but the pastas can be hit or miss. their <mark>Filet Mignon</mark>, which i had my previous visit, is amazing and still ranks as the best filet i've ever had. i'm still tempted to go back and try their porterhouse for two or their riserva steak -- aged for over a year.\n\n4.5 stars", 
            "i always hear about carnevino and we finally got a chance to try it.  hostess was great, adjusted our table and sat us right away.  the restaurant has a nice atmosphere.  a huge window towards the back to overlook the strip.  in the middle of the room is a large wine table.  \n\nfor appetizers we ordered:\n**<mark>Carne Cruda</mark> alla piemontese\nchopped to order steak tartare with raw mushrooms.\n--my friend loves this dish,  for me, it was ok.  i don't eat raw beef that often unless i'm in canada, but this was ok.  not too memorable for me.\n**<mark>Grilled Octopus</mark>\npickled vegetables and limoncello\n--this dish was my favorite.  the minute you bite into it there's a shot of flavor that goes into your mouth.  \n**<mark>Fried Calamari</mark>\nmarinara and pickled hot peppers\n--you can never go wrong with <mark>Fried Calamari</mark>\n\nfor the entrees we ordered:\n**black fettucine\ncrab, jalapenos, and shallots\n--i've never seen black fettucine and i tried a bit from my friend's plate.  it was very flavorful.  i definitely want to go back and try a full plate\n**tortelloni\nlobster and tarragon\n--this was a delicious dish as well.  this and the black fettucine itself would be a reason for me to come back\n**dry aged bone in ribeye (medium rare)\n--this thing is huge.  they first show you as a whole, and then cut it table side.  they put the bone on the side and explain that it's the meat is very sweet on the bone\n**<mark>Filet Mignon</mark>\n--you're typical <mark>Filet Mignon</mark>\n\nfor our sides we ordered:\n**roasted beets with pistachios and gorgonzola\n**sauteed brussels sprouts with pancetta\n**roasted shiitakes with aceto balsamico\n**italian broccoli with house smoked pork \n\nall the sides were delicious and complimented what we ordered.  \n\ndessert:  \n**sorbetti:  quince, blood orange, pear\n--i loved all 3 flavors.  quince tasted a little like apple sauce, blood orange and pear was just refreshing after a heavy meal\n\nso overall the food was great, service.....well that could've used some improvement.  we had to wave down the server a few times, which didn't make me happy.  when he first approached our table to take our order, one of my friends asked him a question and he excused himself and didn't come back for a while.  later on, when we asked for our bill (after waving him down again) my friends brought it to his attention that they had made it clear it was my birthday when they made the reservations.  we also noticed that one of my friends didn't get the 'vanilla bean affogato' he ordered.  instead it appeared the waiter ordered an americano.  the waiter tried to rectify the situation by bringing out a dark chocolate cake w/ vanilla huckleberries + a candle.  the dessert was delicious, but sort of ruined my refreshing dessert i had ordered previously.  \n\nas my friend duke says, bad service i can tolerate, but i can't tolerate bad food.   so carnevino, you're lucky your food is oh so good lol.  i will be returning to try the black fettucine + tortellini.", 
            "honestly, two stars is generous.\n\nfrom the moment we sat down, it was painfully obvious that our waiter had one thing on his mind: to convince us to spend as much money as possible. before we even said a word about the appetizers, he was telling us we should order two, because they are small. same for the pasta. same for the side dishes. (they are small, by the way. we paid $19 for one single lonely raviolo, but if you are getting a steak and some sides, you just don't need individual appetizers and plates of pasta.) he told us we needed to try the $120/person tasting menu, because it really showcased what mario batali is known for, and then proceeded to name-drop \"mario batali\" about half a dozen more times before leaving our table. oh, and then there was the older couple at a table nearby who were obviously spending more money than we were, and when they tried to get the waiter's attention, he stopped in the middle of explaining something to us and scurried over to their table without saying a word to excuse himself. the minute we ordered diet coke instead of wine, any pretenses of good service were all out the window. what? i just don't like wine.\n\nbut what about the food? okay, well, i've had better. specifically, i've had better steaks and sides at cut, also at palazzo. (it's a bit more expensive but worth every single penny.) the <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> i had at cv was just all right. it was also way overcooked; i ordered medium rare and it came out more like medium well, despite the waiter's insistence that \"their\" medium rare was a bit rarer than usual. so much for that!\n\nskip this place. it is crappy. if you are going to spend $200+ at a meal, it needs to be a lot better than this.", 
            "we had dinner here two weekends ago with our girls before our 9:30 pm show (phantom). i'm quite surprised with some of the negative reviews here, esp. about the service, because we had a wonderful fine-dining experience. \n\nour server, michael, was professional and knowledgeable and the pacing was perfect. the sommelier on the other hand was just \"ok\". for $50 corkage, i guess i expected a little more service in addition to the accoutrements. she poured at the right time, she did give us the correct glassware, decanted and everything but she really didn't say much. i was expecting for her to at least give us a menu recommendation that will compliment the wine and highlight the food the restaurant has to offer.\n\nthe setting. it was grand and luxurious. yes, there was \"rock\" music playing. not my preference but it wasn't that loud so it didn't really bother me. i just thought the music didn't quite match the atmosphere.\n\nthe wine. carnevino has an impressive wine list but wildly expensive so we brought our own bottle. (we brought one of our favorites, 97 mondavi to kalon, which of course was not on their list.)\n\nthe food. everything was delicious and perfectly prepared. starting with an amuse of \"cheese puff\" from the chef. then the rosemary ciabatta bread served with the savory \"lardo\" spread.  we started with orders of beef carpaccio, raviolo di stracotto (duck liver & balsamic vinegar) and <mark>Arugula Salad</mark> w/coach farm triple goat cheese, trumpet royale mushrooms, & onion pickles. for our main course, we had veal sweetbread primavera, black fettuccine with crab, jalapenos & shallots, \"fall off the bone\" osso buco alla milanese, saffron orzo & gremolata and 8 oz aged <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> <mark>Italian Broccoli with Garlic and Pork</mark> bearnaise. i thought the osso buco could use a tad more flavor but it was good, nonetheless. then we ordered sides of sauteed spinach w/garlic & hot peppers, & creamy mashed potatoes w/poached egg. the poached egg in the mashed potato made it even creamier. it was perhaps the best mashed potato i've ever had.\n\nlast but not the least, the dessert. most of us were too full but managed to share mascarpone panna cotta w/blueberry sauce and espresso gelati, rhubard gelati & blueberry sorbet. both delicious, creamy and refreshing. perfect way to end a fantastic meal.", 
            "divine ribeye, very rich and fatty but a must-try!  hubby had <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> but thought ribeye was a better choice.  the only negative is that ribeye is only sold as a hunk of meat for two people at 72 dollars per person!!  granted you get a lot of meat but never in my life had i paid 140 dollars for a ribeye!  a bit of sticker shock to say the least!  overall great food but overpriced.  sides were small and nine dollars a pop and very average tasting (ordered garlic spinach and snapeas and carrots, both of which were just \"meh\").  they should just include your choice of sides to the meat dishes, why nickle and dime me when everything is already so pricey?  also, a simple pasta dish consisting of spaghetti, olive oil and parmesan for two-year-old daughter...19.00.  ouch. and, no, i am not exaggerating.  look at the photo of the receipt i downloaded.", 
            "mr. batali, you r good...first of all, just know the prices are over...overpriced...but the food and service was quite delicious. \n\nthe items we tried was the beef tartar...which i loved with the toasted bread.  another must dish is the fruiti de mari....either it be an antipasta or a full meal.  the sauce was amazing...it came with amazing huge lobster tail in half and shrimp, calimari, and clams...it was so delicious..the sauce was most memorable.  it was like eating lobster bisque with pasta..it wasen't just your regular tomato sauce from a jar...it has a seafoodish flavor to it to pair well with the shellfish it came with.  \n\nwe also shared the 8oz. <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> which was served perfectly medium and also came with table service where they sliced the meat into pieces for us and presented it beautifully.  \n\nwe also had the arugala salad which was probably the worst thing we got from this place...it was so acidic, you had to eat lots of cheese to balance the acidity it had on it....we complained to the waiter but all he could do was notify the chef about it....what a sucker.  not there greatest decision there from a waiters point of view.....they could have taken it off the receipt for use...especially since it was the cheapest thing we ordered....and it was quite acidic and discusting. \n\nwe had no room for desert and ate everything else.  glad we didn't waste any food.  great 3 meals out of 4 .\n\noh yeah...after the waiter cuts your meat and ask to add rock salt to your meat...don't do it!!!  just ask for it on the side and taste the meat first before you he does that.  just a safety measure for htn and salty tongue ppl.  :p", 
            "i'm surprised that carnevino doesn't have better reviews. i was very impressed the time that i went here with the quality of the steaks. i have to say that based on the quality alone, this is probably one of the best steaks that i have had in las vegas, and surprisingly i didn't have the bone-in rib eye, like i usually do. the price of the restaurant may be a reason for the low ratings, but if solely on the quality of the food, this should be a 5 star rating. the aged steaks are beyond great and probably the reason i am a big fan. they have a huge bone-in rib eye for 2 (that my friends had) and the meat was super tender and cooked to perfection. i had the double <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> that in my opinion was the best <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> that i have ever had - excellent quality of meat, aged and cooked to perfection, a perfect medium rare.\n\nwhat is also great about this place is not only the great steaks, but since they are an italian steakhouse, they also have some really great pastas. we shared the spaghetti frutti di mare which had numerous and generous pieces of seafood. overall very good pasta with many other selections available too. also, the appetizers that we got were delicious. a must try is the <mark>Grilled Octopus</mark>! we also tried the bruscetta which was also very good.\n\nthe one thing that i was disappointed with here was that we did have some leftovers (mainly the huge bone-in rib eye for 2) and we attempted to take them home. however, for some unknown reason, we were given the wrong bag when we left. we discovered the error and i think that they accidentally threw our leftovers out when the table was cleared but they would not say they did that, so we left with no leftovers at all - and i know the steak would have tasted great the next day. the manager did take our drinks off our bill, which was a nice gesture, but we were still perplexed as to what happened. \n\noverall, a must visit steakhouse for those of you coming to las vegas and wanting a higher end steakhouse.", 
            "i cannot believe how disappointing this meal was.  our group thought, \"mario batali?  must be amazing, right?\".. wrong.  mr. batali needs to get his orange crocs into vegas and try to figure out what is going wrong here.\n\nfirst off, the meal was so expensive.  we were dining with a group who all love good food and don't mind paying a lot for really amazing meals, but this wasn't worth half of what we paid.  \n\nthe service was so bad and they sat our group of 6 at a giant round table that was so large you could only speak to the people directly to your left or right, not conducive to good conversation.  our server was pretentious and frankly had the personality of a rock. \n\nmy husband and i started with proscuitto with seasonal fruit as an antipasti, we shared the gnocchi bolognese as a pasta course, we had the roasted beets as a side, and i had an 8 ounce <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> ($50) and he ordered the 20 ounce bone-in veal chop ($85).  \n\nthe proscuitto was delicious, melt in your mouth, just salty enough, it was really wonderful.  the pasta was disappointing.  at our table we had several different pasta dishes, and every single one of them was a let down.  gnocchi was a little too chewy and the bolognese sauce was just... meh.  nothing special.\n\nmy steak was very good, it was really tender, but i have had (much) better steaks at other steakhouses, paying less, and often the steaks elsewhere are accompanied with something (sides, garnish, something!).  my husband's veal also was good, it was tender and had nice flavor.  again, for me, it's more about the price.  that veal chop was not worth $85.\n\nwe got the roasted beets as a side, and i enjoyed them, but i love beets.  other side dishes at the table went untouched.\n\nthe other dishes ordered at the table included a veal scaloppine and <mark>Lamb Chops</mark>, and the general concensus was that the food was unmemorable and nothing special at all. \n\ni think that if we had paid less for our meals or if we had really exceptional service, we likely would have left carnevino feeling better about the experience.  but when you combine mediocre food, terrible service, a poor table setting, and a sky-high bill, the overall opinion was that this was a bad dining experience.  with all the great restaurants in las vegas, we are sorry we chose this one.", 
            "upside- 12oz. <mark>Filet Mignon</mark>. best steak i've ever had. perfectly cooked medium rare.\n\nthe surprise- the sauteed mushrooms (slight kick to it) and the mashed potatos (w/ a fried egg mixed in) was incredible. i was expecting a great steak (especially for the price) but the sides were the dark horse.\n\ndownside- two things- \n\n1. price, however this was expected and was a special occasion. \n\n2. alcohol, lack of selection for beers to be exact.  i'll admitted i'm not a wine guy but i am a beer guy. i thought that for this caliber of restaurant  they should have more craft beers that you can pair with the meal. however i was told was pretty solid.", 
            "now this is an exercise in restaurant grandeur, and mario batali and his wait staff here do not disappoint.  walking by the restaurant in the palazzo, you do not get the sense of impressiveness; it just looks like a little restaurant tucked away near the entrance of the casino.  however once the maitre'd starts walking you to your table in the main dining room....the experience begins.  i was belittled by the tall ceilings, soaring arches, artwork and the feeling of old italia.  even better is that the restaurant goes on forever, and you'll know what i'm talking about when you go to the restroom (private dining room after private dining room flanked by rustic wooden cabinets filled with bottles and bottles of wine as far as the eye can see.  yeah, this is how they do it here, and it is no joke.  \n\nlet me state that i researched all the top vegas restaurants before deciding to eat here, and so glad we did.  at carnevino you're going to get the best of the best quality ingredients, and classic dishes prepared expertly.  i had the pre-theatre menu, going with the <mark>Tagliata di Manzo</mark> (<mark>Arugula Salad</mark> topped with slices of parmigianino and beef carpaccio), the <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> (medium rare), and the gelati.  we also added in two pasta dishes we wanted to try, beef cheek ravioli and black truffle linguini .... and both were so amazing; pasta perfectly tender and flavors beyond comprehensible.  i would highly recommend trying the pasta -- portions are small so you could easily split one or two.  it just doesn't get any better than the filet at carnevino.  expertly prepared, it is as good as it gets.  the great part about the pre-theatre menu is that you get the same steak on the full menu for a fraction of the price.  the wine list is also beyond.  had the las rocas tempranillo to start, and then went with a full-bodied italian for the steak.  \n\nnow for the service... in a word, top notch.  our waiter was the most articulate and knowledgeable of ingredients, food, preparation i can remember.  he actually got us excited about the history of food...now that is a good waiter. \n\nin sum...carnevino is an experience...so come planning to spend a lot of time having your meal.  my one regret is that we were on our way to a show so couldn't linger for longer. i've been to several of batali's restaurants...del posto, babbo, lupa, and carnevino is my favorite so far.  don't miss this place.", 
            "food 4 stars.  service 2 stars.\n\ni'm a fan of osteria mozza in la so was psyched to try out carnevino by batali in vegas.  first of all i was shocked by how enormous it was, definitely could fit several hundred people no problem.  \n\nthe service started out great, with an amuse bouche, attentive waitering etc, but slowly it started to wain.  he stopped coming by as much and by the end we had to really go track him down which was annoying since we were late for a show.  he also refused to split the check on more than 3 credits cards for our party of 10 which was lame.\n\nthe food was great.  i would definitely say go there for the meat.  the pastas were just ok in comparison and the bruschetta just pass on. but the steak tartare and the <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> and ribeye were amazing.", 
            "i absolutely loved the dry aged rib-eye.  the steak itself earns five stars, but i'm knocking off a star because of the beginning and end of our meal. i was starving already and what felt like an eternity was probably a half hour before our waiter took our order. but i must say that the food came fairly quickly after the order was placed. \n\nwe came with a party of 10. i shared the rib-eye, in addition to two sides, with my husband and a girlfriend.  the rib-eye was well worth the money and should be tried at least once. i would actually eat it a second time.  for the sides, we order the shitake mushooms and asparagus - both were good. \n\nother people on our table ordered the <mark>Filet Mignon</mark>, the porterhouse, and the truffle pasta - none of which were as good as the rib-eye. i tried my friends' dishes as well, but there wasn't much worth remembering about the <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> or the porterhouse. i don't remember the name of the pasta dish, but as soon as the waiter mentioned \"truffle\", the two girls that ordered it were sold on it. unfortunately, truffle is not always good on everything.  the pasta was drenched in truffle oil - definitely too rich for my palate. \n\nby the end of the meal, we were beyond stuffed and didn't have room for desserts. however, we were celebrating the birthday of three of the guys and the restaurant was nice enough to give us some cookies.. or not. though the gesture was nice, other restaurants like elephant bar gives better desserts than cookies to birthday folks. i didn't taste the cookies because the appearance didn't look appealing already, but those that did said it was stale. perhaps they like to age their cookies too???", 
            "3.5*\n\nfirst off, i'm a big fan of osteria mozza (another mario batali joint).  came here for a bachelor party and was hoping this place would live up to mozza.  i got the black fettuccine and grilled halibut.  i also took a couple slices of the bone-in rib eye that was $72/person (serves 2).  \n\ni really enjoyed the black fettuccine.  the flavor of the crab was just perfect, not overwhelming or underwhelming.  if i remember correctly, this was an appetizer.  \n\ngrilled halibut was ok...nothing special.  didn't wow me at all.  maybe this was put on the menu for non beef eaters.  \n\nslices of the rib-eye were disappointing compared to the bone-in rib-eye at osteria mozza.  the texture and flavors were better at mozza.  maybe if i never went to osteria mozza, i would be impressed.  \n\ni will definitely give this place a try again.  i had a slice of <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> too but it was too small of sample to give it a definitive judgement.  i liked the slice of <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> (non bone-in) that i had.",

            "even my mom was impressed with carnevino...and that's a high standard to meet.\n\nwe came here with a group of 7. the gm came out and personally greeted us at the hostess stand when he heard our party had arrived. they had a beautiful table set up all the way in the back of the restaurant (through the wine cellar room, which i thought would have been a cool place to sit as well). with very high ceilings and paintings on the wall, the back room felt like we were in someone's old world castle. it was quiet, romantic and i loved the ambiance. needless to say, service was absolutely impeccable. \n\nsome of us started with bellinis. the chef also sent out some complimentary apertifs. our food order was massive:\n\nappetizers:\n-caprese salad\n-stracciatela (proscuitto and mozz)\n-<mark>Grilled Octopus</mark> served over octopus sashimi (my favorite, the <mark>Grilled Octopus</mark> really was perfectly prepared and so tender)\n-steamed clams (the broth was soooo amazing)\n-lobster with the tail served sashimi style\n\npasta:\n-garganelle bolognese (because i was craving some sort of spicy pasta i requested the bolognese sauce to be made spicy and the chef added a very nice amount of heat)\n-orrechiette \n-beef agnolotti\n\nentrees:\n-dry aged bone-in ribeye (for 2 people) this thing was massive, i will upload a pic. we took the gigantic bone home for my mom's teacup malteses. so spoiled.\n-<mark>Filet Mignon</mark>\n-<mark>Lamb Chops</mark>\n-bison (available on their special menu)\n*note that the meat prepared at carnevino is prepared a little less than requested. for example, if you request medium rare, it will come out closer to rare.\n\nsides:\n-spinach\n-mashed potatoes\n-<mark>Fregula, Pecorino Romano, Butternut Squash</mark>\n-cauliflower gratin\n-porcini mushrooms\n\ni tried little bites of everything. we were all so full that dessert could not even be considered. the service and food were absolutely outstanding and i can't wait to experience carnevino again soon.", 
            "** i somehow just discovered that i had an 'unfinished review' that i started at least a year ago. wow. i'll portion off the section i wrote originally, and continue below it. **\n\n-----------original------------\ni've eaten here twice, about 18 months apart. both times, i noted that the ribeye was one of the best steaks i've ever enjoyed.\n\na couple days ago, i took my dad and my roommate here for dinner. they seated us despite sandals, caps, and general raggedness, as we'd spent the whole day moving to a new condo. service was impeccable and friendly. most notably, the timing of the servers' trips to the table was flawless. my dad and i shared a ribeye for two with black pepper horseradish sauce, while my roommate had an 8oz <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> with the same sauce. we all shared sides of romana beans and <mark>Tuscan Fries</mark>. everything was amazing.\n\nmy roommate and i got beers, of which they have a nice selection of imports, but my dad stuck with water, having to drive back to la right after dinner.\n\nall dishes were excellent. they did, however, play an entire rolling stones album during the meal. that was fairly annoying.\n-------------------------------------\n\nah yes. i have now eaten here three times, another shortly after the recount above. i took both of my parents and my roommate back only a couple months later, and had another fantastic meal. even fewer little details to complain about this time.\n\nmy mom is allergic to cow's milk, so sometimes it's a challenge for a restaurant to avoid all dishes with butter or milk used in any stage of the prep - especially butter. but this place handled it marvelously, customizing everything for her with no issues. and the server immediately understood what her request was, which is a rare mark of quality in our experience.\n\nyet again, this meal was tremendous. we did order red wine this time around, which, in my opinion, is just-about imperative at a nice steakhouse. unfortunately, they didn't have my favorite spanish red in stock, but the sommelier reccomended a very nice and affordable bottle that we all enjoyed.\n\ni'm rambling. this steakhouse kicks serious butt. every side is classic, rustic, and delicious. never too salty, sweet, cheesy, or anything strong enough to take away from the relatively subtle flavors of aged steaks. the wine and beer selections are top-notch. service is immaculate. and the steaks...you'd contemplate killing your best friend to get one of their steaks on your plate.\n\nbut man...the music. it's consistently annoying. it's probably just me and there are probably a lot of people who either don't notice or enjoy it, so i'm not making much of a point about it. but i am docking a star.\n\nhighly recommended!", 
            "things have changed a bit at carnevino since the first time i went.  it's still a top notch steakhouse but if and only if you come in prepared and knowing what to order and not order.  \n\ni've had the pleasure of dining here a few more times and this is what i can say for sure:\n\n- only go if you're ordering the riserva (call ahead), the dry aged bone in ribeye for 2 or the florentine porterhouse for 2.  i usually go with the ribeye.  sure it's more than the usual steak but no one should be coming here to pinch pennies.  which leads to my next suggestion...\n\n- don't be a cheap ass.  outback is at casino royale next door.  there's nothing wrong with being frugal but your experience won't be good if you're trying to do it here.  \n\n- the sauces are a waste of time.  you don't need it if the steak is awesome.  \n\n- the <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> quality has changed since they opened and i don't think it's worth ordering anymore.\n\n- think of the pasta as an appetizer to share among friends or just a pricier side dish.  they are not dinner entree portions and don't bother ordering it if that's your plan.  b&b is just on the other side at venetian and you'd have a better experience there.  that being said, i really like the ricotta and egg raviolo with brown butter and get it almost every time i go.  the spago is excellent as well.  \n\n- what's even better than great meat for an entree?  great meat for an appetizer!!  the prosciutto di parma 'riserva' is heavenly.  one order is good for 4.  \n\n- this isn't a very romantic spot.  the music is mostly rockin and the tables are positioned a little weird with that middle section making you feel like you're dining in a hallway. \n\ngod bless mario batali!!",

            "(our group's reservation was made a comfortable two days before our visit) \nthe evening was already soured when our hostess rudely broke her centimeter-thick temper. our group of five asked to be seated in the main restaurant, and not the small, triangle room completely separated and across the hotel hallway. the hostess then told us that they only have two tables in the entire restaurant that can accommodate 5 people. we were then seated in \"the wine cellar\" beneath the hotel escalators. first encounter with a restaurant should not be a poor mannered hostess. ambience was off putting as music choice was loud and inappropriate for an italian steakhouse that only offers very few bottles of red wine under $200. \n\nhowever-\n\nour waiter and sommelier were very kind and very knowledgable of the menu and wine list. major props to them- when asked about wine pairings for a crab and white truffle sformato, they were able to offer great, educated choices (we ended up pairing the dish with a heavy chardonnay which, though wildly overpriced, worked well). other notes on the food:\n\n(everything was overpriced- so i won't mention it in every description)\n\nporterhouse steak (mr): not sure what happened here, the cut more resembled venison as it tasted unusually gamy. \n\n<mark>Filet Mignon</mark> (mr): my order- very tasty, great portion, well cooked, and cut like butter. \n\n\nbeet carpaccio: lots of flavors, fun presentation, very light, very small portion. \n\npastas: we ordered two pastas which were both relatively underwhelming, though very fresh- mostly poor meal pairing on our part i suppose?\n\ndesserts: light and tasty, no flavor complaints.\n\nin general- everything was very harsh on the palate, which made building our meal in three-course form, as the restaurant suggested, difficult. there were some pleasant notes in the evening, but overall we were underwhelmed and unimpressed.", 
            "we had a beautiful dinner, <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> and the <mark>Bone-In New York Strip</mark> steak...with mashed potatoes and italian broccoli...to die for!! i recommend a nice glass of reisling with your meal. be prepared to spend a pretty penny, but totally worth it :)", 
            "disappointing experience. i went with my mom for her birthday. i was expecting a spectacular life-changing meal. carnevino did not deliver.\n\nfirstly the table that was given to us was a four top that was obstructed by one of the columns in the restaurant so that you couldn't pull out your chair the entire way. bad start. also, as a person with mobility issues sometimes i need to arrange the chairs and table so i can access them. our host had helped us move the table out so that i could sit down and our waiter immediately came and moved it back and was quite cross with the host for moving the table.\n\nthe breadbasket was okay but nothing spectacular. i didn't care for the lard that was served with it. \n\ni'm a pretty small person and can't eat more than a 10 ounce steak at best. unfortunately this puts me at a disadvantage to some of the more specialty steaks on their menu. i was also going with someone whose choice of doneness varies from mine, so sharing was not an option.\n\nwe both ordered the <mark>Filet Mignon</mark>; i ordered mine medium rare and mom ordered hers medium well. having read the reviews before hand and their unique take on doneness we specifically indicated that i wanted my red in the middle and that she wanted her's pink. our waiter indicated that in order to do medium well, the chef required it to be butterflied. my mom was hesitant but i recommended that if the chef required it to be done medium well and that's how she should do it. what a mistake. my filet was good it did have a nice crust on it and it was a medium rare. my moms was certainly well done. no pink at all. our waiter checked on us before we had started eating and at that time everything was fine. we could not catch his attention until my mom was 90% done her steak. we complained about the doneness of it and he said we should've complained earlier because now there was nothing he could do about it. he did not offer to redo the steak and he did not offer to compensate us in anyway for the experience.\n\nour sides did not improve the experience greatly. we ordered the caprese salad, the bucatini amatriciana and the fregola. the caprese were cherry tomatoes which i don't care for and did not say in the description. the fregola was very cheese forward and salty. the bucatini was good, pasta al dente and a nice sauce with a spicy kick.\n\ni had the panna cotta rhubarb compote for dessert. the bitterness of the rhubarb was a nice contrast to the sweetness of the panna cotta. \n\nmaybe i erred in not ordering their special aged steak, but the rest of the experience was so poor that i'm not going back to find out.", 
            "very fine italian steakhouse. went with industry collagues and did a 3-course tasting. just... delicious.\n\ncan't tell you everything, but we did have <mark>Fried Calamari</mark>, dry aged beef tortellini, some other pasta and sliced meat with these little bread rolls you wrapped the meat around, and the meat included the chop, dry aged bone-in ribeye, <mark>Filet Mignon</mark>, and dry aged <mark>Bone-In New York Strip</mark>. i'd say the temp came in just a hair over medium-rare, but all in all... fantastic meal.\n\nalso had the chocolate & peanut butter torte for dessert. heaven.\n\nyou won't be disappointed.", 
            "this is supposed to be an italian steakhouse restaurant. the rosemary bread (stale) was served with a dish of lard and a dish of butter, neither ever served in italy (where is the olive oil?). the <mark>Zach's Chopped Salad</mark> was full of cabbage - also never found in italy (maybe in germany like the lard). the salad had no dressing and none of the italian cheese or meat that was suppposed to be in it. the ricotta and egg raviolo had a raw egg yolk in it which when cut into ran all over the plate (the egg yolk should be thickened like eggs benedict). it was gross. the <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> was so tough that i had to squash the filet against the plate using the red handled steak knife they supplied to cut through it. it was cooked properly medium rare. there was no salt and pepper on the table.  we asked for some and they brought out a small dish with large crystals of salt (imported from london they said).  they said to pick some up and grind it between your thumb and forefinger to break down the large salt crystals. i don't like grinding my salt myself and it is not very sanitary. my wife ordered the veal. it was served floating in a dish of brown water.  she was looking for a place to pour off all the liquid so she could eat the veal but there was no way to do this. we ordered sparkling water.  they said it is trucked in from montana and filtered 7 different ways. the water tasted like plain water - san pelligrino water would have been much better. this restaurant is trying to be trendy and failing. i ordered a grappa for after dinner. they served it in a very small wine type glass, only around 1/4 of a shot. at least my wife's grand marnier after dinner drink was 1 shot is size. i do not recommend this restaurant and it is not italian.", 
            "the best steak i've had in my life. we tried ordering the <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> but the server talked us out of it and convinced us that we had to try the dry aged new york steak. it came out rare with a thin sear and usually i need my steaks at least medium rare but the quality of the meat was so awesome that i actually preferred it being that red. the spinach was a good side dish and of course a little wine to make an event of the whole meal.\nwe told the staff that we were in a hurry and they rushed out the order and had us out of there in less than 45 minutes. it was so worth it even though we wouldn't spend a lot of time there to be able to try the steak. i wasn't even mad at the waiter for upselling us, it was almost like he did us a favor by convincing us to get the new york steak. prime."

            "i was incredibly satisfied with the quality of service and delicious food!\ni came here with a group of girls and we shared our main courses in pairs, so we could try a bit of everything.  we got the <mark>Zach's Chopped Salad</mark>, rib eyes for 2, <mark>Lamb Chops</mark>, fillet mignon, and a few sides, and everything came out perfectly cooked and delicious.  i'm not a big meat eater but i finished my portion of the rib eye.  i loved the fact they cut our giant rib eye for 2 at the table.  they cut them into perfect portions and plated them onto individual plates for us.  the steak knives were cool looking too, not the typical steak knives you usually get at a steak house.  \nthe wine list was huge, it was the entire 3 out of 4 pages of the menu.  they have a lot of good offerings for glasses of wine or by the bottle. \ni would definitely come here again when i'm in vegas.", 
            "my friends and i spent another wonderful evening at carnevino during our last trip to vegas.  we made last minute reservations for 12 people.  the restaurant is big enough to accommodate large groups.  it's a bit of a maze, so pay attention when you walk all the way to the back of the restaurant.  the staff was once again very knowledgeable about the food and made suggestions accordingly.  they didn't offer sangria, but the waiter suggested a sangiovese mixed drink that tasted like crushed strawberries.  it was so refreshing and hit the spot.  i tried the veal saltimbocca & bacon-wrapped asparagus.  the veal was salty as it should be.  the asparagus was perfectly breaded, crunchy, and crisp.  my friends ordered the <mark>Lamb Chops</mark> with <mark>Mint Pesto</mark>, osso bucco, beef carpaccio, seafood spaghetti, la fiorentina, and the <mark>Filet Mignon</mark>.  all of the dishes were delicious.  one of my friends ordered the caprese salad to start and we were delighted that the mozzarella was freshly hand-pulled and creamy.  the combination of tomato, basil, and mozzarella was divine!  another great experience in las vegas.", 
            "location: in venetian/palazzo walkway.  we stayed at the venetian in a suite, b&b was already taken, so we went to the other mario batali restaurant in the hotel.\n\nfood: we had a party of 9.  ribeye (each order is for 2 people at 65 per person, ny strip, <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> ($40), <mark>Lamb Chops</mark>)  for sides we got the spinach with garlic & hot peppers, sauteed mixed mushrooms with cipollini onions, mascarpone & guanciale mashed potatoes (sorry for the caps, i copy/pasted from the website, forgot what the sides were called and what was included).  each side is for a portion for 2 ppl to share, so we got 2 orders of each of the previous sides.  each of the sides were recommended by the waiter.  personally i liked the mushroom with cipollini onions the best, the onions were absolutely amazing.  as for the entrees, noone was dissapointed.  i heard \"best <mark>Lamb Chops</mark> ever\".  the rib eye had insane marbling, and was cooked to perfection.  the cv steak sauce that we got with the steaks tasted like a vinegrette based with rosemary and other herbs infused.  ive had better steak sauce before.  also the ribeye comes with a massive bone, which they give to you.  on it has meat as well, the meat was very good, with a beef jerky like flavor but obviously much more delicious.\n\nprice: for the party of 9, and 6 sides with a bottle of wine, 1 appetizer (cured meats), no dessert.  comes out to be about 100/person.  almost a thousand total.  kind of pricey, but noone complained about it being overpriced, meaning they all thought they got their moneys worth.\n\nservice: excellent. period.\n\noverall: great food, sides could use improving, but the entrees more than makes up for it.  the quality of the ribeye is probably the best ive ever had.  if the sides were up to par, it would easily get 5 stars.", 
            "this place is amazingly delicious -- had a 4-person party that ordered the 2-person ribeye, the <mark>Lamb Chops</mark> and the daily special, a lobster pasta soup sort of affair.  the meat is amazingly juicy, cooked perfectly.   \n\ni don't usually write on the internet really embarassing things, but the lamb was so good that i kept making those rachael ray yummo faces.  and i always make fun of people on the food network who do that!  but when you have a huge plate of perfectly cooked lamb at your command, there's nothing you can do but make a face and go mmmmm.  even the calamari was done right, a dish so easily screwed up at most restaurants.\n\nthe drinks we ordered were well-mixed and my only complaint is that 70%+ of the wine list was insanely expensive for a $45ish entree place.  i mean, really.  expensive.  \n\nthis place is delicious, and your waiter will treat you amazing.   try it!", 
            "i recently went to carnevino on a friends recommendation and was blown away. the arugula and goat cheese salad was incredible, and the cheeze puffs were as good as they get. i have never been a <mark>Lamb Chops</mark> fan, but i am now addicted to them because of this place. the wine was impeccable as well as the service. go carnevino!!!!!", 
            "i am so damn broke.  damn you mario batali & joseph bastianich.\n\nwe stayed at the palazzo so we figured... we might as well choose a restaurant within the property and finally decided on carnevino.  the restaurant itself is pretty big and we were brought all the way to the back, which was nice since it wasn't as loud as the main dining room and the high ceiling definitely makes it a nicer place to dine at.\n\nafter looking through the menu, the server somehow convinced us to go the \"family-style\" way, which is priced at a minimum of $100 per person but he would have the chefs prepare the top dishes in each course to share: 5 appetizers, 4 pastas, and 5 different cuts of meat.  he also guaranteed that we would not go hungry even though it was 9 guys.  \n\nit ended up as one of the most expensive meals but pretty legit.  they started out by bringing rosemary infused bread that everybody gets with 2 kinds of spread: housemade butter and flavored pork back fat.  yes, pork back fat, aka lard.  don't be scared cause it was amazing haha.\n\n for appetizers, they brought out:\n\n1. <mark>Insalata Caprese</mark> - amazing caprese salad with thick slices of heirloom tomatoes and a mozarella & cream combo called burrata.\n2. <mark>Grilled Octopus</mark> - freaking amazing.  i never had octopus that tender and the limoncello reduction over it was genius.  \n3. <mark>Fried Calamari</mark> - common item... but damn when it is done this well, i don't want it anywhere else. \n4. hanger steak carpaccio - special of the night and pretty much a pile of arugula with a delicious steak carpaccio underneath and over it.\n5. <mark>Affettati Misti</mark> - selection of house cured meats with a variety of grilled peppers.  the pork belly seriously just melts in your mouth.\n6. grilled foie gras - umm..... yes yes yes.  i think they drizzled a balsamic reduction over it too.  crap.. i'm seriously drooling right now.\n\nas for the pastas, each dish are all appetizer servings but if you want, you can add $15 more to make it into entree size.  all the pasta dishes are much more about the ingredients.  they brought out:\n\n1. potato gnocchi bolognese - just.. really really solid gnocchi with a really good bolognese.  wish there was more bolognese though.\n2. puttanesca - olives, capers, and anchovies with penne.  simple but so good.\n3. beef cheek ravioli - beef cheek = one of the most tender cut of meat ever and they even drizzle aged real balsamic over it.  yea.  heaven.\n4. black truffle pasta - when this came out, i was just... at a loss for words since it had real shaved slices of black truffle all over it rather than the typical truffle oil you see at many places.  the spaghetti itself with made with extra yolk too so the texture was amazing.  favorite out of all.\n\nfor the meats, they bring it all out and they carve it off the bone right in front of you:\n\n1. veal chop - tender, perfectly done.  the bone-in probably gave it extra flavor.\n2. dry-aged bone-in ribeye - i love the seasoning and the crust.  italian seasoned steaks is just good eating.  i still think gallagher's dry-age beef is better though!\n3. <mark>Lamb Chops</mark> - ok this was the best lamb i've had.  i'm not a big fan of lamb because of the gaminess, but somehow it's all good and it is absolutely amazing.  \n4. <mark>Pork Chop</mark> - done medium well, and the way it is brined gives what seems like a really boring piece of pork good flavors.\n5. maine lobster tail - they only brought out one so it was kinda hard to share among all of us but... it was buttery goodness!  hahah.\n\nthey also brought out two sides: mashed potatoes with marscapone & guanciale (type of unsalted bacon) with raw egg yolk mixed in, and sauteed mushrooms & onions.  both were perfect as side dishes.\n\nat first we were afraid that we weren't gonna get full since the appetizer and pastas' portions were not big at all but after everything, we couldn't finish all the protein and it ended up being the perfect late night snack after xs :p\n\nif you come with a big group, definitely think about getting the \"family-style\" since you'll get to truly taste what carnevino is all about.  just expected to drop... quite a bit of money especially if you order wine and after the 20% gratuity charge.", 
            "i wasn't sure what to expect at mario batalli's restaurant in the palazzo hotel and casino and this was going to be our big night out so our fingers were crossed that this would be good. our debit card had been suspended due to a shopping trip i had taken earlier to la perla (oops) so s was on the phone trying to tell bank of america that we were in fact in las vegas while i waited for him at the restaurant's entrance (they wouldn't seat us until we were both there). this wasn't a big deal because they offered prosciutto wrapped bread sticks which were delicious. when seated s remarked that there were only 4-tops in the restaurant which was fabulous for a party of two - you could stretch out while feeling cozy at the same time. the restaurant's atmosphere echo's its steakhouse vibe and i was surprised at how gigantic the restaurant really is. we were seated in the front room and only realized on a trip to the restroom that the place goes back quite far. upon sitting down, we were brought our immense menus and if i thought nobu's menu was confusing i was in for quite a time with this one. this menu isn't confusing so much as immense. it's physically quite large and our waiter explained that typical of italian dining you order an antipasti, a pasta and then a meat course. we dove right it. to start, i had the big eye tuna crudo and s had the dry aged beef carpaccio on arugula and both were delicious. for our pasta course, i ordered the ricotta and egg raviolo while s had the \"spago\" with lamb ragu. my plate was insane. one lone raviolo sat in a pool of brown butter and when you cut into it the egg underneath ran out and the cheese mixed with it and made just utter fabulous-ness all around. finally, the meat. up to this point we were impressed but given that this was a steak house, we were holding back all judgment until our final course. i ordered the <mark>Lamb Chops</mark> \"scottadita\" with a cumin scented yogurt sauce and s had the bone in <mark>Bone-In New York Strip</mark>. we were blown away. s said that his steak was amazing - with a nice char on the outside while the inside was perfectly pink. my <mark>Lamb Chops</mark> were delicious and had that gamey flavor that comes with good lamb. what struck us the most was that while this was a high end dining establishment, there was also a certain amount of casualness that made it comfortable. in this beautiful and dim dining room they were blasting the rolling stones. the sommelier was really approachable and  became like a good friend when he realized our interest in wine which was a nice touch as he recommended some great ones (which i sadly can't remember now). the wine list is incredible so if you like italian wines, go crazy. essentially, carnevino felt like mario batalli was in the kitchen cooking your dinner. no detail was overlooked and everything was incredible. i wish he'd open a restaurant in the bay area because that man knows italian food.",

            "i cannot believe how disappointing this meal was.  our group thought, \"mario batali?  must be amazing, right?\".. wrong.  mr. batali needs to get his orange crocs into vegas and try to figure out what is going wrong here.\n\nfirst off, the meal was so expensive.  we were dining with a group who all love good food and don't mind paying a lot for really amazing meals, but this wasn't worth half of what we paid.  \n\nthe service was so bad and they sat our group of 6 at a giant round table that was so large you could only speak to the people directly to your left or right, not conducive to good conversation.  our server was pretentious and frankly had the personality of a rock. \n\nmy husband and i started with proscuitto with seasonal fruit as an antipasti, we shared the gnocchi bolognese as a pasta course, we had the roasted beets as a side, and i had an 8 ounce <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> ($50) and he ordered the 20 ounce bone-in veal chop ($85).  \n\nthe proscuitto was delicious, melt in your mouth, just salty enough, it was really wonderful.  the pasta was disappointing.  at our table we had several different pasta dishes, and every single one of them was a let down.  gnocchi was a little too chewy and the bolognese sauce was just... meh.  nothing special.\n\nmy steak was very good, it was really tender, but i have had (much) better steaks at other steakhouses, paying less, and often the steaks elsewhere are accompanied with something (sides, garnish, something!).  my husband's veal also was good, it was tender and had nice flavor.  again, for me, it's more about the price.  that veal chop was not worth $85.\n\nwe got the roasted beets as a side, and i enjoyed them, but i love beets.  other side dishes at the table went untouched.\n\nthe other dishes ordered at the table included a veal scaloppine and <mark>Lamb Chops</mark>, and the general concensus was that the food was unmemorable and nothing special at all. \n\ni think that if we had paid less for our meals or if we had really exceptional service, we likely would have left carnevino feeling better about the experience.  but when you combine mediocre food, terrible service, a poor table setting, and a sky-high bill, the overall opinion was that this was a bad dining experience.  with all the great restaurants in las vegas, we are sorry we chose this one.", 
            "***carnevino is expensive, but the meat choices (like the <mark>Bone-In New York Strip</mark> and veals chops) as well as the grill octopus and lobster ravioli are very good***\n\nwhile i am not a big fan of las vegas restaurants, mario batali's carnevino definitely excels at putting out great meat dishes.  we had several of their meat offerings including the <mark>Bone-In New York Strip</mark> and the veal chop and both were very good.\n\nthe <mark>Bone-In New York Strip</mark> was a thick cut and it had a great crispy outside sear, which was flavorful.  the meat was very tender.  it was undercooked at rare, but it still had a good flavor (and was of course moist).\n\nthe veal chop was better.  it was also very thick, but it was cooked more appropriately.  veal chops should be between medium rare and medium and this one was.  the meat was moist and tender while the outside crust was distinct and flavorful.  veal can often be a tad bland, but this one had a good flavor.  this was probably the best veal chop i have ever had.\n\nthe <mark>Lamb Chops</mark> were just okay.  unlike the other meats, the <mark>Lamb Chops</mark> were not that thick.  they were a tad overcooked and while they did have a decent flavor and were tender, they were just not as juicy as they should have been.  also, the outside crust was not as good as the veal or the <mark>Bone-In New York Strip</mark>.\n\nwe had two other dishes that were also very good.  one was their <mark>Grilled Octopus</mark>.  i've heard batali's <mark>Grilled Octopus</mark> at osteria mozza is very good.  this one was exceptional.  the octopus was very soft (which can be difficult with octopus) and it had a great flavor.  there were some good pickled vegetables on the side and maybe something else like prosciutto to give it a nice savory flavor.\n\ni have not enjoyed many of batali's pastas, but i did like his lobster anolini.  the lobster filled ravioli was very good--moist with a great lobster flavor.  the cream sauce was mixed with tarragon and it was flavorful and fragrant without being overly buttery or rich.\n\nmost of the other items were in the just okay range.  the <mark>Arugula Salad</mark> featured a triple cream, but the triple cream was surprisingly dry and a little hard.  the bruschetta was okay (as was the big eye tuna crudo).\n\nwe had the pappardelle <mark>Italian Broccoli with Garlic and Pork</mark> mushrooms and while the pasta sheets were good, the pasta went cold quickly.  it was also a little bland.  i was expecting the braised pork agnolotti to have a more impactful filling, but it was not as moist or savory as i was hoping for.  the garnish of chanterelles was good though.  there was a little bit of <mark>Fregula, Pecorino Romano, Butternut Squash</mark> on the plate, but it did not provide the sweet flavor i was expecting.\n\nmost of the sides were just okay (like the spinach and the roasted beets), but the mashed potatoes with mascarpone and a poached egg were rich, creamy and quite good.\n\ni had the flourless chocolate cake for dessert and it was okay.  i am not the biggest fan of flourless chocolate cake because it can be too dry.  while it was a little bit dry, it had a good (but maybe not great) chocolate flavor.\n\nservice was good.  the staff was attentive and the food came out at a good pace.\n\nprices were high (which is common in las vegas), but when you share several of their dishes (family style), you might be able to save a little bit of money.\n\ncarnevino has very high ceilings and a loud atmosphere.  the place has the look of other expensive steakhouses--kind of masculine looking with lots of dark browns.\n\nthe meat at carnevino is very good and it is up there with some of the best a la carte steakhouses i've tried.  i am not the biggest fan of these steakhouses, but carnevino is one of the better ones and they even have a few other good things (like the lobster ravioli) to balance out the meal.\n\ncarnevino is located in the palazzo, which has free parking (valet or self).", 
            "visited carnevino with two business associates last night. i had very high expectations going in, given that this is a mario batali establishment, and quite frankly for the price, i was disappointed. the restaurant was beautiful, but the music was waaaaay too loud! the entire night, i had led zeppelin, u2 and some other weird junk blasting in my ears. i love classic rock, but i found this very out of character with the restaurant. not sure mario would have approved that music choice. the waiter and wait staff were excellent. very attentive without being overbearing. allowed us to move along at our own pace. we never felt rushed. the wine list was extensive, and exhaustive to read. their focus is obviously on imported wines, primarily italian, which fits with the theme of the restaurant. great selection, vegas prices, what can i say?! the food was a mixed bag. bread (buns?) came with a salted butter, and some gelatinous pork fat spread. it was no pork rillette, for sure. it tasted like flavored lard. as for antipasto, i had the <mark>Insalata Caprese</mark>. it was nothing like the pictures you see on the web site here. obviously getting fresh tomatoes in vegas in february must be a challenge, but this had 4 slices of like re-hydrated sun dried tomatoes with a pesto sauce with some very mild white cheese. where is the buffalo mozzarella? where are the heirloom tomatoes. very disappointing. one of may associates had the caesar salad and didn't finish it. we also tried the beef cheek ravioli's. very good, especially with the aged balsamic as a kicker. now for the main attraction, the meats. these wee 3 of the finest cuts of meat i have ever seen. i had the 16 oz bone in new york. wow!!!!! cooked to perfection, beautifully seasoned, and tasted incredible. another associate had the 8 oz filet. again, a superb piece of meat. i think he licked the plate!!! however, the main attraction were the <mark>Lamb Chops</mark>. three of the biggest (they are double cut), juiciest and most perfectly cooked chops i have ever seen. the flavor was beyond words. the chops were a work of art! so large though that my associate could not finish it all. we also had the fries as a side dish. pass on those. soft, soggy and drenched in oil. yuck! \n\ni would recommend carnvino for the meats. they are spectacular. as for everything else, they were very mediocre to poor. as a restaurant owner, i was a little disturbed by the quality and consistency of the experience given the steep price tag you pay.", 
            "went for dinner on 11/9 at 6pm.  i thought it was strange that the restaurant was split into 2 sides.  one side had a bar and looked bigger.  we were seated in the other half.  \nambience:  very low key, and kinda boring.\nservice:  was good but nothing out of the ordianary.  waiter came right away and made some good recommendations.  water was promptly refilled. our table (as well as the one next to ours) was unbalanced.  so one of the servers had to get down on his knees and make some adjustments.  kind of awkward.\ndrinks:  had a decent wine list (nothing like cut) and approx 10-15 different scotch's to choose from.\nfood:  we had been comped a prix fixed dinner menu and decided to stick with it.  first off, the bread and lard butter(?) was amazing.  we then started off with a steak tartare and chop salad. the salad was ok, but the tartare was really good.  for the main course, i had the best <mark>Lamb Chops</mark> ever.  it came with a pesto sauce, but the meat alone was really flavorful.  my friend had the filet and it was just ordinary.  dessert was really really good.  we had the carrot cake and a lemon italian doughnut.  both were really excellant.  \n\nall in all, a nice dining experience", 
            "even my mom was impressed with carnevino...and that's a high standard to meet.\n\nwe came here with a group of 7. the gm came out and personally greeted us at the hostess stand when he heard our party had arrived. they had a beautiful table set up all the way in the back of the restaurant (through the wine cellar room, which i thought would have been a cool place to sit as well). with very high ceilings and paintings on the wall, the back room felt like we were in someone's old world castle. it was quiet, romantic and i loved the ambiance. needless to say, service was absolutely impeccable. \n\nsome of us started with bellinis. the chef also sent out some complimentary apertifs. our food order was massive:\n\nappetizers:\n-caprese salad\n-stracciatela (proscuitto and mozz)\n-<mark>Grilled Octopus</mark> served over octopus sashimi (my favorite, the <mark>Grilled Octopus</mark> really was perfectly prepared and so tender)\n-steamed clams (the broth was soooo amazing)\n-lobster with the tail served sashimi style\n\npasta:\n-garganelle bolognese (because i was craving some sort of spicy pasta i requested the bolognese sauce to be made spicy and the chef added a very nice amount of heat)\n-orrechiette \n-beef agnolotti\n\nentrees:\n-dry aged bone-in ribeye (for 2 people) this thing was massive, i will upload a pic. we took the gigantic bone home for my mom's teacup malteses. so spoiled.\n-<mark>Filet Mignon</mark>\n-<mark>Lamb Chops</mark>\n-bison (available on their special menu)\n*note that the meat prepared at carnevino is prepared a little less than requested. for example, if you request medium rare, it will come out closer to rare.\n\nsides:\n-spinach\n-mashed potatoes\n-<mark>Fregula, Pecorino Romano, Butternut Squash</mark>\n-cauliflower gratin\n-porcini mushrooms\n\ni tried little bites of everything. we were all so full that dessert could not even be considered. the service and food were absolutely outstanding and i can't wait to experience carnevino again soon.", 
            "mario batali....what have you done?  i'm your biggest fan of osteria mozza in la and was expecting mozza quality and deliciousness at carnevino.  with the quality of a sizzler and the service of olive garden (actually although i hate their food, the service is even better), i am taking some of my \"i'm your foodie groupie\" points away big time!!  that's what happens when these great restaurant owners grow too quickly.  service and quality goes way down.  :(  \n\nchris was our first waiter, but then we got stuck with goose.  rude, sarcastic, made racist jokes, just unbelievable.  maybe he should have been stuffed and served on a platter instead of serving customers.  i can't imagine a guy like that making it at macaroni grill, let alone a mario batali restaurant.  \n\nok, on to the food.  the steak tartare was decent, but it went down from there.  i ordered the <mark>Lamb Chops</mark> as my entree.  as many others said, they way undercook things.  i asked for medium rare, but the meat was oozing with blood!  yuck!  and it was at least 75% fat.  fortunately, chris came to the rescue when he sent it back to the kitchen for me and took it off the bill.  i had ordered the brussel spouts as a side.  they were mediocre at best.  needless to say, i skipped on the dessert.  mr. batali...please, don't ruin the image i've had of you.  keep a few restaurants that you can manage and consistently deliver mozza quality.  otherwise, you will be boxed in with the outback steakhouse & olive garden.  fortunately, osteria mozza is still 5 stars in my book.",

            "carnevino is one of the early restaurants i've bookmarked on yelp (2011!), and i've finally kicked this one off my food bucket list. \n\nfirst a disclaimer - my friend has a sister who used to work with the the staff here, so we had amazing service. with that said, onto the food...\n\nthe appetizers - we got to try the <mark>Grilled Octopus</mark>, <mark>Carne Cruda</mark> alla piemontese (steak tartar), and the lonza.\n\n1. <mark>Grilled Octopus</mark> - i've never tried octopus this tender. always have i thought that octopus is always chewy and tough, but the way carnevino cooked it was amazing. the light citrusy sauce and the sprouts complemented the octopus well - easily one of my favorite things of the night.\n\n2. <mark>Carne Cruda</mark> alla piemontese (steak tartar) - solid steak tartar. comes with mushrooms on top and what i believe are thinly sliced oyster(?) mushrooms on the side. very good, comes with delicious crostinis. \n\n3. lonza - interesting fava beans and ricotta salad. it was a great balancer to other heavier things, although i wouldn't really put this on the top of my list to order. \n\nonto the pasta. \n\n1. beef cheek ravioli - this is a secret dish that i believe is from mario's other restaurant, b&b. we got it with truffle on top. this was heavily talked up, but not exactly my cup of tea. when it comes to pasta, i prefer red sauce over white, meaning this dish was way too rich for me. delicious nonetheless, but not my favorite.\n\n2. gnocchi - surprisingly good. i never usually like gnocchi so this is quite possibly the best gnocchi i've had. comes with english peas, prosciutto, ricotta salata. it's not over the top rich and it's really chewy. \n\n3. orecchiette - sweet sausage and broccoli rabe, come in red sauce. this was the best pasta of the night. so addicting and chewy. get it.\n\nnow the main course - meat.\n\n1. <mark>Lamb Chops</mark> - split between 6 people, we got one rack each. the lamb was so tender and did not have that gamy flavor lamb usually has. v\n\n2. porterhouse for 2 - definitely the star of the show. you come here to get this. the filet side of the porterhouse was soo tender and juicy. especially the part attached to the bone. one of the best steaks i've ever had. \n\n3. bone in ribeye - this was better than the strip part of the porterhouse, but worse than the filet. all around, it felt like the better bang for the buck than the porterhouse.\n\nof course they wouldn't let us leave without dessert...we had two things but the strawberry shortcake was money.", 
            "wow the dry-aged ribeye for 2 was amazing along with the <mark>Lamb Chops</mark>.  ribeye was very tender, moist and flavorful.  <mark>Lamb Chops</mark> were the best i've ever had - they kept the fat caps on so it was very fatty, juicy, and also flavorful and sweet (though my mom thought they were too fatty but i thought that was the best part).  for 3 people this was more than enough food.  we almost couldn't finish it all with a side of roasted beets which was also very yum.  be prepared to spend some $$$ as the ribeye for 2 was $72/person and the <mark>Lamb Chops</mark> alone was $63.  i think you can easily get either the ribeye or <mark>Lamb Chops</mark> and share a pasta or appetizer to compliment.  great selection of wine as well.  would definitely come back!!", 
            "i've been here three times now and always come away impressed, though i have to say my recent third visit was a little less impressive than the first two. the first time i came, i had the ny strip and it was, without a doubt, the best steakhouse beef i've ever had. the second time i had the filet at the bar and it was also delicious. this time, a buddy and i made our own surf and turf, as he got the ny strip and i got the seafood pasta and we shared. the steak was not as good as the first two times. oh, it was still good, it just wasn't great like the first couple. the seafood pasta was nice, but a couple of bits of the lobster were tough and i was hoping for more spice. i will give them major props for the octopus appetizer, which was hands down the best octopus i've ever had. incredibly tender and with rich flavor from a superb limoncello marinade. batali has a way with the eight-tentacled creature, because the second-best octopus i've ever had was at the b&b over in the venetian. another person at the table got the three double-cut <mark>Lamb Chops</mark> and it was enormous almost to the point of being ridiculous. i mean, this was not mary's little lamb--this was a monster. as some others have mentioned, the sauces here are entirely extraneous and unnecessary. for the vast majority of dishes, the regular preparation is plenty of seasoning. the sides were hit and miss. the hit was the spinach with garlic and hot pepper, which was a cool take on steakhouse spinach, being something other than creamed. the mascarpone mashed potatoes, though, were the sorriest excuse for mashed potatoes ever placed in front of me at a steakhouse. i'd say they tasted like instant, except that would be an insult to instant. i really hope it was just an off night for the potato chef. \n\nservice and pacing were on point, as you would expect from these owners in this location.\n\ncouple of other notes: when we ordered the ny strip medium-rare, we were told, \"our medium-rare is more like rare.\" huh? isn't this thing supposed to be somewhat standardized? i mean, if it's \"more like rare\", then call it rare and stop confusing people who went to double helix and had two pear winetinis before dinner.\nalso, this restaurant is huge. (i guess it would have to be, just to store the <mark>Lamb Chops</mark>.) but i mean really, i believe there are palazzo guestroom bathrooms that are closer to the tables than the one in the restaurant. plan ahead and start walking when you sort of have to tinkle; don't wait until you really have to tinkle.",

            "i am so damn broke.  damn you mario batali & joseph bastianich.\n\nwe stayed at the palazzo so we figured... we might as well choose a restaurant within the property and finally decided on carnevino.  the restaurant itself is pretty big and we were brought all the way to the back, which was nice since it wasn't as loud as the main dining room and the high ceiling definitely makes it a nicer place to dine at.\n\nafter looking through the menu, the server somehow convinced us to go the \"family-style\" way, which is priced at a minimum of $100 per person but he would have the chefs prepare the top dishes in each course to share: 5 appetizers, 4 pastas, and 5 different cuts of meat.  he also guaranteed that we would not go hungry even though it was 9 guys.  \n\nit ended up as one of the most expensive meals but pretty legit.  they started out by bringing rosemary infused bread that everybody gets with 2 kinds of spread: housemade butter and flavored pork back fat.  yes, pork back fat, aka lard.  don't be scared cause it was amazing haha.\n\n for appetizers, they brought out:\n\n1. <mark>Insalata Caprese</mark> - amazing caprese salad with thick slices of heirloom tomatoes and a mozarella & cream combo called burrata.\n2. <mark>Grilled Octopus</mark> - freaking amazing.  i never had octopus that tender and the limoncello reduction over it was genius.  \n3. <mark>Fried Calamari</mark> - common item... but damn when it is done this well, i don't want it anywhere else. \n4. hanger steak carpaccio - special of the night and pretty much a pile of arugula with a delicious steak carpaccio underneath and over it.\n5. <mark>Affettati Misti</mark> - selection of house cured meats with a variety of grilled peppers.  the pork belly seriously just melts in your mouth.\n6. grilled foie gras - umm..... yes yes yes.  i think they drizzled a balsamic reduction over it too.  crap.. i'm seriously drooling right now.\n\nas for the pastas, each dish are all appetizer servings but if you want, you can add $15 more to make it into entree size.  all the pasta dishes are much more about the ingredients.  they brought out:\n\n1. potato gnocchi bolognese - just.. really really solid gnocchi with a really good bolognese.  wish there was more bolognese though.\n2. puttanesca - olives, capers, and anchovies with penne.  simple but so good.\n3. beef cheek ravioli - beef cheek = one of the most tender cut of meat ever and they even drizzle aged real balsamic over it.  yea.  heaven.\n4. black truffle pasta - when this came out, i was just... at a loss for words since it had real shaved slices of black truffle all over it rather than the typical truffle oil you see at many places.  the spaghetti itself with made with extra yolk too so the texture was amazing.  favorite out of all.\n\nfor the meats, they bring it all out and they carve it off the bone right in front of you:\n\n1. veal chop - tender, perfectly done.  the bone-in probably gave it extra flavor.\n2. dry-aged bone-in ribeye - i love the seasoning and the crust.  italian seasoned steaks is just good eating.  i still think gallagher's dry-age beef is better though!\n3. <mark>Lamb Chops</mark> - ok this was the best lamb i've had.  i'm not a big fan of lamb because of the gaminess, but somehow it's all good and it is absolutely amazing.  \n4. <mark>Pork Chop</mark> - done medium well, and the way it is brined gives what seems like a really boring piece of pork good flavors.\n5. maine lobster tail - they only brought out one so it was kinda hard to share among all of us but... it was buttery goodness!  hahah.\n\nthey also brought out two sides: mashed potatoes with marscapone & guanciale (type of unsalted bacon) with raw egg yolk mixed in, and sauteed mushrooms & onions.  both were perfect as side dishes.\n\nat first we were afraid that we weren't gonna get full since the appetizer and pastas' portions were not big at all but after everything, we couldn't finish all the protein and it ended up being the perfect late night snack after xs :p\n\nif you come with a big group, definitely think about getting the \"family-style\" since you'll get to truly taste what carnevino is all about.  just expected to drop... quite a bit of money especially if you order wine and after the 20% gratuity charge.",

            "overrated is being kind. we find carnevino grossly overrated, ridiculously overpriced, and completely underwhelming.\n\non second thought: we found it insulting.\n\nwe were in town for a weekend with couple friends, wanted elegant italian, and got a strong recommendation from a local (cab driver).\n\nwine list, for which this place is famous, is absurdly pricey. almost nothing under $100.

            "i am really baffled by all the hate for carnevino in the reviews. i first came here about 5 years ago when i cam to vacation in las vegas and have been back probably 10-15 times since i moved to las vegas. i always go when people are in from out of town and want a good steak place so i have been with about 20-30 different people. never have any of us gotten a bad item, had bad service, or not loved it. i am a unapologetic fine dining snob and until gordon ramsay steak opened this was my favorite steak restaurant in vegas- and for the steak itself it is probably slightly better than grk (grk has better non steak dishes and desserts). i can't wait for someone else to visit so i can try the new beef tasting menu. \n\nthe restaurant comes from mario batali (orange crocs) and joe bastianich (the mean judge on amster chef). if you have been to any of their other restaurants carnevino is similar in many regards- formal fine dining atmosphere, similar slowly paced service, the waitstaff likes to talk etc. this isn't for everyone- some people just want to order their food and have it delivered in less than 10 minutes without a lecture on italian after dinner drinks (grappa by the way is an acquired taste- i almost gagged the first time i had it but now i love it). if you do go to carnevino give yourself at least two hours and have a backup liver waiting for transplant. \n\nthe steaks\nusually i would start with appetizers but let's be honest- you are here for a giant slab of meat. \n\n here are the steaks i have had ranked in order\n\n1. bone in ribeye for two. this is carved tableside. if you like ruths chris serve your steak at 1500 degrees sizzling deal you might not like this as it is served more room temperature- and if it is warm at all the heat quickly goes away from the thinly sliced meat. it is very tasty though- the seasoning is very light so its all beef taste.\n2. ny strip- not usually one of my favorite cuts but i have gotten it a few times for variety and it is better here than elsewhere i have had it.\n3. bone in filet- superior to the boneless imo- has the very soft texture and less beefy taste you expect from a filet. \n\nnow, not always, but most of the time, they have a special steak that is aged longer- if this is available for the love of all that is holy get it. pay whatever they ask- 100$ a pound, 200$ a pound, your first born- whatever it takes. these steaks taste like nothing you have ever had or likely will have again in the future. they have an almost blue cheese like flavor that is incredible. i have had plenty of expensive food that i would say was not worth it- this is not one of those. \n\nnon steak items- i have ordered a few of these - <mark>Pork Chop</mark>, osso buco, and they are great- if you are a local and can come here frequently i highly encourage you to try them. if you are in from out of town though, you probably just want to get a steak or you will return him and find yourself lying awake in bed, filled with regrets.\n\nappetizers- there are quite a few beef appetizers. you can go two ways with this- some people will find beef on beef on beef to be too much- we call them french. so if you are worried about your blood test results get something else, if you love america here are some suggested apps (not all of these are beef but are meat)\n\n\n1. <mark>Carne Cruda</mark>- raw beef good. \n\n2.prosciutto di parma and <mark>Affettati Misti</mark>- picking between these two is slightly harder than sophie's choice\n\n3. beef cappallacci -this has some really strong goat cheese which is amazing but may knock your socks off. \n\n4. anolini- lobster pasta- whats not to love", 
            "we ordered the beef ribeye for two, the <mark>Pork Chop</mark>, the beef cheek ravioli, mixed mushrooms with onion, and the parmesan potatoes. it was so amazing. it was the biggest steak i've ever seen. something out of the flintstones with the bone attached. they carve it table side and finish it with extra virgin olive oil. the beers and wine were light and complemented the meat. the ambiance, the expert waiting staff, and the location  are all part of the experience. you get what you pay for and this, abiet expensive was worth it.", 
            "this steak house has hands-down the best <mark>Pork Chop</mark> i've ever had in my life.  medium well, thick juicy tender cut of heaven.  that and the lard spread are both to die for!  if i were on death row and was to request a last meal before i part this world.. i would choose this <mark>Pork Chop</mark>.",

            "this is actually one of the more difficult reviews i've had to piece together.\n\nhad booked a table for 7 of us a month or so in advance of a guy's trip out to vegas.  knew we wanted a big bold steak night and had obviously heard good things.  the steak did not disappoint.  in fact, it was the single best piece of beef i've ever had.\n\nobviously, this place is incredibly expensive.  i knew this going in and had zero problems.  200 dollars later (for myself), and my problems were still minimal, but present.\n\nwe ordered multiple plates of food to pass, and in addition to trying a few bites of beef cheek pasta (underwhelming) and the <mark>Pork Chop</mark> (slightly overcooked, but deliciously porky), i ordered the sweetbreads and the dry aged strip.  sweetbreads were very well cooked for the 4-5 bites that existed for the ~40 dollar price, but the accompaniments of artichoke and lemon combined to overwhelm with their astringency.  the strip steak was magical.  the unbelievable funk that permeated the meat put me into a carnivorous coma.  amazing, and worth the price tag.\n\nordered a young bottle of cabernet, decanted per request.  service was numerable and polite.  room itself is rather....bland? certainly not the most beautiful place to eat, but try and forget whilst focusing on your steak.  if you're not planning on ordering the steak, make reservations somewhere else.  but if you're in the mood to ravage like a carnivore with a bottle of red, this is your place.",

            "i was dinning alone and was disappointed that the steaks were both too large and too expensive.   i'm very familiar with premium steakhouses and the rise in beef costs but the they were offering a 16oz ny strip for $70.   why not a 10oz or even a 12oz?\n\ni was talking to the couple next to me and they made the same observation.  they had trouble finishing the one steak they split.\n\ni ordered the <mark>Pork Chop</mark> milanese style and it lacked the dark, crusty fried outside i prefer.  the meat was good and it was not overcooked but it was under flavored.   instead of a chopped arugala or green salad it had a braised fennel topping with very sparse grape tomato halves.   again, for me these was a miss in that i prefer flavorful greens and more tomatoes.  i like this dish because you don't need to order a salad usually, the topping, along with shaved parm  usually fills the bill,  but this topping disappointed.\n\nthe butter served with the bread was great but the bread itself reminded me of the bread they serve in italy....good but lacking in salt....bland in other words.\n\nthe house fruilino by bastinich is very good.\n\nthe bar area is lively.....walk all the way to the back....the beauty of the restaurant is hidden in the back.\n\nalso, a word to the tall bartender....if someone asks you for an ice water, serve it with ice.  this is america and we like ice in our ice water.  and don't frown if a single person isn't ordering sides.  your menu is too geared to large parties.", 
            "went to vegas with some of my buddies back in january and of course we had to hit up carnevino for some steaks. a friend and i had the 90 day dry aged ribeye for 2 which was served table side. i also had the pasta with lamb ragu. the pasta was alright but nothing to write home about. when the steak arrived we were pretty excited because it looked awesome. they carve it then drizzled it with some olive oil (i think?) and sprinkled some salt ontop. i thought it was weird that they drizzled the oil but what the hell do i know. anyways the steak was med rare as we requested but i didn't find that it tasted anymore delicious than a steak you got a ruth chris. i actually found the oil off putting. one of my friends got the <mark>Pork Chop</mark> which he said was absolutely delicious. i'm on the fence as i would come back again. it gets 3 stars because it wasn't terrible but it was delicious. however, for the price maybe this place only deserves 2*..."

            "i've always come to yelp to read helpful no-hold-barred reviews but this is the first time i've been moved to write one of my own because no one should waste their time and money at this \"fine dining\" restaurant. \nbefore we sat at our table we had a nice glass of prosecco at the bar with a very affable bartender - it looked like we were in for a great night...until we got seated with a server who was part used car salesman part annoying high school substitute teacher.  this guy proceeded to go through and lecture us on the menu for literally 10 minutes...we can read guy and we get it you want us to order the most expensive steak you offer.  this server (i use this term very loosely because we didn't get his name) proceeded to tell us that we shouldn't consider the filet or the fish dishes (really, batali puts items on his menu that aren't good?) and that the sides aren't like ruth chris \"you can't just order them\" - what does that even mean?  so after mentioning that they keep many of the items in italian to encourage \"a dialogue\" we knew that this was one strange place.  \nthe night before my vegetarian friend suggested i get the buccatini without the pork and she recommended i get the small size, which is literally enough for one person but i should have been tipped off when they said they'll try and push the big size.  ok i'm a vegetarian and even though i'm going to a place called meat & wine i'm allowed to be there and eat what i like.  so after asking for the buccatini sans pork he looked and me and said he wouldn't do it...\"if we start taking things out of our dishes it'll just get strange and i don't want to put a plate of strange in front of you.\"  i'll be the judge of strange buddy and don't bs me because my friend ordered it last night.  he wouldn't take my order and said \"i'll come back to you!\"  what happened to the \"dialogue\" he promised earlier?  needless to say he hassled everyone of my friends about our orders saying zingers like \"that's just 5 bites and won't be enough\" \"you have to get all of your orders in now because it'll just get awkward if you want more food later.\"  after we ordered we all decided to leave because we were made to feel so uncomfortable - these servers must be working on commission. \ni spoke to the matre'd on the way out who to his credit was very apologetic and flabbergasted the waiter wouldn't adhere to my vegetarian request.  he offered to seat us in another section - we just wanted to get out of this boiler room so he paid for our drinks.  if this restaurant wants to survive they need to chill out on the hard sell and let people order sizes <mark>Italian Broccoli with Garlic and Pork</mark> they feel comfortable with - even though i wasn't getting a steak for 2 i would have drank for two!", 
            "if i was a good girl (which i'm not most of the time), and i died (which will happen one day) i would end up at carnevino for the rest of my life.\n\nnestled between three (no four, no six) of my most favorite things (craps, blackjack, the schlots, and the strip bitches)is carnevino, tucked under the back escalators of the palazzo . \n\nwith high ceilings, huge windows, and an intimate, darker settling, mario batali has cooked up some of the best food i've have ever had. ever! i repeat ever! carnevino is a must have on my list every time i visit my home away from home, the city of sin. \n\nwith delicious starters, like petite fried cheeseballs delicately wrapped in a napkin with amazingly fresh butter, your palate begins to sing while reading the menu. the fresh mozzarella with heirloom tomato salad was incredible. the cheese had flavor i haven't had since italy. the olive oil by itself was flavorful, delicate, rich, but didn't overpower anything. the basil was perfect and aromatic beyond belief.\n\nand then came the pasta. parpardelle <mark>Italian Broccoli with Garlic and Pork</mark> mushrooms with a fresh reggiano grated on top that was to die for. perfectly al dente, with amazing texture and flavor, i ate until i thought i would throw up, literally. \n\nhis steak, the larger fillet mignon was done to perfection, black and blue. beautiful and pink in the inside, charred on the outside, plated, alone on a large white plate. nothing, just the steak of perfection, seated, alone. you can choose a variety of sauces to come with the meat, he, choosing after my favorites, opted for the black truffle sauce. we expected a flavored truffle oil, but no, a full gravy sized dish came, laden with amazing petite pieces of black truffle, all nestled at the bottom. when he looked left, i dug into the sauce with my spoon, and it was true. they were pieces of truffle, no essence, not shavings, but pieces. i was in heaven. i could die now, or maybe after i make 50k at craps first. \n\nwe were too full, and couldn't eat anymore, but our server, who i have had many times, recommended the pumpkin doughnuts. anyone who knows me can answer the question, \"if danielle had 24 hours to live, what would she eat?\" and answer with confidence, \"doughnuts\". is that your final answer? well, maybe doughnuts and truffles, but separately of course.\n\nthe tiny doughtnut hole sized bites were fried pieces of perfection. crispy, covered with sugar and cinnamon, with a thick, rich pumpkin interior. it was like the best pumpkin pie you've ever had, on crack, mixed with a doughnut. amazing! it took twenty minutes to get up from the table after that.\n\nbut craps was calling me, and you know what i'm like when i gamble. i only stop to pee, drink, smoke, and eat, at carnevino of course.", 
            "warning: if you want to be able to eat here and live with yourself, you'll have to dumb yourself down a bit and pretend you don't understand the word \"lardo\" when you read it on the menu. are you ready? good.\n\nthat said . . . helloooooo, beef carpaccio with \"warm lardo crostini.\" loved that this was one of the pre-theater menu antipasti offerings. so delicious. \n\ni have to admit, i was less slightly less charmed by my main course -- the pappardelle <mark>Italian Broccoli with Garlic and Pork</mark>, served with a fresh grating of parmesano-reggiano (chef's suggestion) -- than i was with the first. it's hard to follow a tender meat-and-lardo pairing with truffles and pasta, no matter how perfectly al dente that pasta may be. \n\nit is even more difficult -- if not impossible -- to then be delighted by a simple gelato/sorbet. the texture doesn't follow, the flavor doesn't quite match; nothing is really right about the arrangement.\n\nso i left with mixed feelings about carnevino. on the one hand, my departing taste was that of bland, \"espresso\"-flavored gelato (flavor not really recommended). on the other hand, it's nearly a week later, and i still drool every time i think about the carpaccio or the delightful <mark>Tuscan Fries</mark> my husband had with his filet. perhaps skipping the dessert would just be your best option.", 
            "if it wasn't for winning big in poker the night before, i would have ended up at delmonico instead of carnevino (where they nickel and dime you for everything.) from our experience at pizzeria mozza, i knew better to order a coke (for $5.) but i did not expect every sauce to be an additional $5. i understand a good steak doesn't need the frills of a sauce but i just thought it was funny even the lamb had an optional $5 mint sauce. another example of crazy costs is $22 appetizer pasta. that's right, pasta is an appetizer here, haha. it is an additional $15 to make it an entr\\u00e9e. whatever batali, you win. you're food is still fantastic. every bite of food perplexes the mind; even the bread (delicious) with peppered lard that turned out to be pretty good. highlights of the night:\n\n+ + (appetizer) black fettuccine with crab, jalapeno and shallots - wow, what an amazing dish\n+ (entr\\u00e9e) <mark>Bone-In New York Strip</mark>\n+ (side) <mark>Italian Broccoli with Garlic and Pork</mark> and hot peppers - if only the pork was its own dish, yum!\n\nnote: 20% off your tab after 10pm and make your reservations on opentable.com for points and ease. i changed our reservation 3 times that night since we were running late from love. also, don't worry too much about the \"business casual\" dress code. you're still on the casino floor for goodness sake. it's not that dressy.\n\nif and when i'm on a hot streak again, i'm taking my winnings to carnevino.", 
            "went there for a celebration dinner over the labor day weekend and glad we did!\n\nmario batali is an amazing chef, i try to keep track of all the shows he does on tv, even get inspiration for my own cooking from him (never copy). we sort of stumbled on the restaurant while walking around palazzo and venetian and immediately i wanted to go, after changing into the best clothes we brought with us, of course! \n\nso, we went in with a feeling of honor and excitement and very high expectations. and, boy, were they met! their service was amazing, at first we thought 4 or 5 people were waiting just exclusively on us, but than asked and turns out they all work as a team and keep an eye on all the tables and don't let a dirty plate or an empty glass go without notice, everything is cleaned up and refilled momentarily!!!\n\nnow the food. oh the food! i decided not to worry about my waistline and talked my companion out of any guilty feelings he may have had! we ordered  <mark>Insalata Caprese</mark> to share, and a bottle of sicilian wine (their wine list is just unfair, it takes up 2.5 pages on huge menu sheets!). \n\nwhile we waited for the main courses, someone brought freshly whipped butter and a lardo with rosemary spread with warm chiabata rolls then came duck liver pasta and gnocchi with gorgonzola and nut sprinkled  beets and baby <mark>Italian Broccoli with Garlic and Pork</mark> (only sure about half of the dishes, the ones i ordered). it all looked and smelled delicious! like a childhood memory i've never had! \n\nwe also ordered desert, which i did not have room for, but tried a bit anyway, looked fabulous! \n\nnot something we would do every day, the bill came to about $100 per person, but it is so worth it!", 
            "food:\nwe started with the caprese salad. it was amazing. they served fresh, local heirloom tomatoes with creamy burrata cheese. 4 large slices and one generous portion of cheese.\nthen we had 2 pastas. one was the crab and jalapeno black fettucine. the sweetness of the crab blended perfectly with the spicy jalapeno. the fettucine was also cooked perfectly al dente. the other was the duck liver ravioli (4 big pieces in small order). the best part was aged balsamic vinegar that they drizzled over the ravioli that balanced the heaviness of the liver. the best pastas we have ever had in our lives (even in italy)\nwe ordered the ribeye that was shared by 2 ($65 each person). they serve it tableside, cutting the bone off first and then slicing different parts of the ribeye <mark>Italian Broccoli with Garlic and Pork</mark> it out so that each person has the same amount of different cuts of the ribeye. it was perfectly cooked and the flavor was amazing. they did drizzle some olive oil on the ribeye, which i didn't think was necessary. i would have preferred some more vinegar on the side since the ribeye was so rich and fatty.\n\nservice:\ni was really high maintenance and they were excellent. first, i'm not a fan of rosemary and they had served rosemary rolls. i asked if there were other types, and they checked in on it for me. the manager came by and asked what was wrong and explained my options (which was not much - just crostini that was pre-cooked and not warm). i said that was fine and my waiter came by later to also check in on my satisfaction with the crostini.\nthen, i had ordered a glass of wine with the ribeye. my waiter opened a new bottle for me and poured a tasting. i unexpectedly thought it was too light for the ribeye and said \"i guess it'll be ok\". the waiter took notice of my response and offered a glass of another wine instead. he then poured a sample of a heavier wine which matched much better with the ribeye. after i approved of the new wine, he poured me a glass of this new wine.\n\nall in all, this was an excellent restaurant. i wish it was cheaper, but the food was worth the cost. \n\none note: the prix-fixe pre-theater menus are only available at certain times (for example, being seated before 6:30). although we were actually dining before a show, our reservation was at 7 (for a show at 9:30) so the prix fixe dinner was not available. we're actually glad it wasn't because we wouldn't have had a chance to try the excellent dishes we ended up ordering.", 
            "wow!  where do i start?\nprobably with the most sincere thank you for making my cousin brian's wedding dinner phenomenal.  with the limited number of guests attending their destination wedding, they were looking forward to enjoying a stellar dinner with a small group.\n\ncarlos, our waiter, made sure jessica and brian received the best treatment!  he carefully explained the different elements of the menu and made the best recommendations on how to go about choosing each course.\n\nour sommelier also did a perfect job in helping us select wines to go with each course.\n\nour dinner:\nappetizers: calamari and ahi tuna\npasta: black fettucine and pappardelle\nmain course: rib eye <mark>Italian Broccoli with Garlic and Pork</mark> steaks\n\none word: amazing!\n\nagain, thank you to the chef and carlos for an unforgettable evening!", 
            "pasta:\nwhoever said there was no flavor might be lacking some taste buds because the flavor was all there. i wanted to slurp the whole bowl into my mouth at once. you can't go wrong with any of the pasta's because they're fresh made, and it's apparent! they claim the pasta is batalli's forte. it's too bad it is so ridiculously expensive <mark>Italian Broccoli with Garlic and Pork</mark> are tiny. i only tried it because we had a vegetarian at the table (oops, my bad for choosing a steakhouse on our last night!).\n\nmeat:\nmy. god. rib. eye. so good! this is the first time i have been impressed by meat in vegas. especially because i've made my rounds to steakhouses like craft, i had my doubts given this place had a half star less. no.. it is so delicious, you must come here for the meat.\n\nsides:\nso the mashed potatoes with egg didn't blow me away, but it was still good. i was actually a little nauseated by the complimentary focaccia with \"emulsified\" (read: mushy) lard. we opted for the <mark>Italian Broccoli with Garlic and Pork</mark> belly (tastes like bacon!), and they can make this vegetarian if desired (don't know who in their right mind would want to do that). sides aren't that big but they're unnecessary because the meat is enough to really tide you over.\n\nservice:\nthe service was not as pushy as i thought they would be. they did drop batalli's name several times, but he was nice enough, and offered what i felt were reasonable and helpful suggestions.\n\nnote: for parties of 6 or more, they require a credit card deposit.", 
            "we had dinner here two weekends ago with our girls before our 9:30 pm show (phantom). i'm quite surprised with some of the negative reviews here, esp. about the service, because we had a wonderful fine-dining experience. \n\nour server, michael, was professional and knowledgeable and the pacing was perfect. the sommelier on the other hand was just \"ok\". for $50 corkage, i guess i expected a little more service in addition to the accoutrements. she poured at the right time, she did give us the correct glassware, decanted and everything but she really didn't say much. i was expecting for her to at least give us a menu recommendation that will compliment the wine and highlight the food the restaurant has to offer.\n\nthe setting. it was grand and luxurious. yes, there was \"rock\" music playing. not my preference but it wasn't that loud so it didn't really bother me. i just thought the music didn't quite match the atmosphere.\n\nthe wine. carnevino has an impressive wine list but wildly expensive so we brought our own bottle. (we brought one of our favorites, 97 mondavi to kalon, which of course was not on their list.)\n\nthe food. everything was delicious and perfectly prepared. starting with an amuse of \"cheese puff\" from the chef. then the rosemary ciabatta bread served with the savory \"lardo\" spread.  we started with orders of beef carpaccio, raviolo di stracotto (duck liver & balsamic vinegar) and <mark>Arugula Salad</mark> w/coach farm triple goat cheese, trumpet royale mushrooms, & onion pickles. for our main course, we had veal sweetbread primavera, black fettuccine with crab, jalapenos & shallots, \"fall off the bone\" osso buco alla milanese, saffron orzo & gremolata and 8 oz aged <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> <mark>Italian Broccoli with Garlic and Pork</mark> bearnaise. i thought the osso buco could use a tad more flavor but it was good, nonetheless. then we ordered sides of sauteed spinach w/garlic & hot peppers, & creamy mashed potatoes w/poached egg. the poached egg in the mashed potato made it even creamier. it was perhaps the best mashed potato i've ever had.\n\nlast but not the least, the dessert. most of us were too full but managed to share mascarpone panna cotta w/blueberry sauce and espresso gelati, rhubard gelati & blueberry sorbet. both delicious, creamy and refreshing. perfect way to end a fantastic meal.", 
            "carne vino - meat and wine, that is what this place is all about. only the highest quality beef, veal, <mark>Italian Broccoli with Garlic and Pork</mark> are served here. the bread is served with not only butter, but also cured lardo. cheese fritters, almost like gougeres, are served before the meal.  and we were delighted to find that they had several different vintages of our favorite wine - solaia, from the antinori vineyard we visited on our honeymoon - on the list.\n\nwe decided to go with something we had not seen anywhere else before - the beef tasting menu. four courses of beef - what could be wrong with that? nothing, as it turns out.\n\nfirst course - wagyu beef (think kobe) served raw in a crudo with olive oil, vinegar, coriander, and saffron, topped with fennel. this was elegant and complex - the bright hits of saffron and the warm nuttiness from the coriander lent an exotic feel to a traditionally italian dish\n\nsecond course (a favorite from the whole trip) - beef cheek ravioli. savory and satisfying slow cooked meat inside perfect pasta (this is a batali restaurant, after all), finished with a balsamic aged so long it has become thick and sweet - perfection.\n\nthird course - a wet aged beef served with a breaded quail egg and deliciously garlicky spinach. i love beef paired with egg, so i was very happy here.\n\nfourth course - dry aged beef with bearnaise. i didn't particularly care for the potatoes that accompanied this course, but the beef was excellent. because of the tasting, we had the chance to compare wet and dry aged beef directly which was very interesting. we felt that there was more of a textural difference than a flavor difference.\n\non to the desserts - i had the the vanilla semifreddo that was listed on the menu; served with pistachio rum sauce and extremely fresh strawberries.  my husband told the server that he preferred chocolate, and the pastry chef made a flourless chocolate cake with raspberries for him.\n\nthe first two courses were far better than the two main courses, so i would recommend carnevino for italian inspired dishes (like the crudo) and fabulous pasta.", 
            "no offense but i came with a bachelorette party of 8 for some fine dining. and yes while we got good food, it wasn't worth the almost $600 tab, especially when alcohol wasn't even involved.\n\nwe had to share:\n- fruiti di mare spaghetti ($31) - your basic sea food red sauce pasta. nice inclusions were the lobster bites.\n- pappardelle with 'porcini trifolati' ($22 for the \"appetizer portion\", $37 for the dinner portion) - this was good but i've had just as good for less than the appetizer price.\n\nhere's the doosie:\n-bone in ribeye for 2 - watch out for the price - they list it as $72 but it is really $72 x 2 = $144 for one large ribeye steak\n- porterhouse for 2 - again same tricky pricing wording - they list as $80 but it is really $80 x 2 = $160 for one large porterhouse.\n\ni'll be honest, i've had ribeye <mark>Italian Broccoli with Garlic and Pork</mark> steaks and they tasted as good but no steak should cost $160 unless it is encased in gold. seriously, this was ridiculous\n\ni don't even want to bother telling you about the sides and dessert we ordered because in the end, the outrageousness of the steak prices boggles my mind.\n\nthe food and service were fine. but i'm telling everyone now, save your money and go somewhere else. you can get just as good at any other place and still have money to go gamble.", 
            "***carnevino is expensive, but the meat choices (like the <mark>Bone-In New York Strip</mark> and veals chops) as well as the grill octopus and lobster ravioli are very good***\n\nwhile i am not a big fan of las vegas restaurants, mario batali's carnevino definitely excels at putting out great meat dishes.  we had several of their meat offerings including the <mark>Bone-In New York Strip</mark> and the veal chop and both were very good.\n\nthe <mark>Bone-In New York Strip</mark> was a thick cut and it had a great crispy outside sear, which was flavorful.  the meat was very tender.  it was undercooked at rare, but it still had a good flavor (and was of course moist).\n\nthe veal chop was better.  it was also very thick, but it was cooked more appropriately.  veal chops should be between medium rare and medium and this one was.  the meat was moist and tender while the outside crust was distinct and flavorful.  veal can often be a tad bland, but this one had a good flavor.  this was probably the best veal chop i have ever had.\n\nthe <mark>Lamb Chops</mark> were just okay.  unlike the other meats, the <mark>Lamb Chops</mark> were not that thick.  they were a tad overcooked and while they did have a decent flavor and were tender, they were just not as juicy as they should have been.  also, the outside crust was not as good as the veal or the <mark>Bone-In New York Strip</mark>.\n\nwe had two other dishes that were also very good.  one was their <mark>Grilled Octopus</mark>.  i've heard batali's <mark>Grilled Octopus</mark> at osteria mozza is very good.  this one was exceptional.  the octopus was very soft (which can be difficult with octopus) and it had a great flavor.  there were some good pickled vegetables on the side and maybe something else like prosciutto to give it a nice savory flavor.\n\ni have not enjoyed many of batali's pastas, but i did like his lobster anolini.  the lobster filled ravioli was very good--moist with a great lobster flavor.  the cream sauce was mixed with tarragon and it was flavorful and fragrant without being overly buttery or rich.\n\nmost of the other items were in the just okay range.  the <mark>Arugula Salad</mark> featured a triple cream, but the triple cream was surprisingly dry and a little hard.  the bruschetta was okay (as was the big eye tuna crudo).\n\nwe had the pappardelle <mark>Italian Broccoli with Garlic and Pork</mark> mushrooms and while the pasta sheets were good, the pasta went cold quickly.  it was also a little bland.  i was expecting the braised pork agnolotti to have a more impactful filling, but it was not as moist or savory as i was hoping for.  the garnish of chanterelles was good though.  there was a little bit of <mark>Fregula, Pecorino Romano, Butternut Squash</mark> on the plate, but it did not provide the sweet flavor i was expecting.\n\nmost of the sides were just okay (like the spinach and the roasted beets), but the mashed potatoes with mascarpone and a poached egg were rich, creamy and quite good.\n\ni had the flourless chocolate cake for dessert and it was okay.  i am not the biggest fan of flourless chocolate cake because it can be too dry.  while it was a little bit dry, it had a good (but maybe not great) chocolate flavor.\n\nservice was good.  the staff was attentive and the food came out at a good pace.\n\nprices were high (which is common in las vegas), but when you share several of their dishes (family style), you might be able to save a little bit of money.\n\ncarnevino has very high ceilings and a loud atmosphere.  the place has the look of other expensive steakhouses--kind of masculine looking with lots of dark browns.\n\nthe meat at carnevino is very good and it is up there with some of the best a la carte steakhouses i've tried.  i am not the biggest fan of these steakhouses, but carnevino is one of the better ones and they even have a few other good things (like the lobster ravioli) to balance out the meal.\n\ncarnevino is located in the palazzo, which has free parking (valet or self).", 
            "for me, this is the type of meal that is once in a lifetime. maybe later in life i will have others that compare but this meal was truly memorable. \n\ni was so excited that we got to sit in the wine cellar at carnevino, being that i love red wine. it was so charming and swanky to be seated next to a stellar collection of wine. i'm sure that is mostly thanks to joe bastianich, mario's partner for carnevino. \n\nanyways, onto the food. they give you a delicious loaf of warm bread along with whipped butter <mark>Italian Broccoli with Garlic and Pork</mark> fat. i usually shy away from such decadence but we are talking mario batalli here!! i indulged...multiple times...throughout the night. this is what it's all about people! we decided to order 5 appetizer portions of pasta in lieu of steak, is that bad? if it is, i don't care because the pasta was the best pasta i ever ate. we had pork ragu, frutti de mare (seafood), and spicy tomato and basil. \n\nthe wine list is expansive and impressive, not to be missed. go and trust the waiters, they know their menu and are happy to talk it out with you. i loved every minute and carnevino!", 
            "what an outstanding meal! we had a group of 9 and had ribeye <mark>Italian Broccoli with Garlic and Pork</mark> steaks ... along with ravioli, salad, shrimp, <mark>Pork Chop</mark>. everything was a 10 out of 10. all were very satistied and all enjoyed the quality. wait service was outstanding. however, i am extremely disappointed with a restaurant of this stature having left a group of 9 waiting 35 minutes past the reservation time ... basically not honoring a reservation. having brought this to the attention of the hostess several times, we kept hearing \"just a few more minutes\". we even brought it to the attention of the manager, who just reiterated this and said that he didn't want to have to throw the prior party out. poor excuse. no comp was offered, even after it was requested.", 
            "i ate here the evening of october 8th.  after an extremely disappointing start, it was a very good dinner.  i dined with a party of five business associates.  we were shown to our seats and assured that the waiter would be over shortly, but we waited about 30 minutes for him to come over and take our drink orders.  we saw him taking other tables food orders, but i would think priority would be to put drinks in front of the guests.  who knows.  regardless once he finally came over with the wine, the experience was excellent.  we put our fate in his hands and let him pick the appetizers, main coarse and sides and don't think any of us could have done a better job on our own.\n\nhe brought us out the <mark>Bone-In New York Strip</mark> <mark>Italian Broccoli with Garlic and Pork</mark>, then cut it up for individual portions for the table.  the taste was amazing as was his selections for our sides.  the dinner was extremely expensive and we probably would not ordered the way we did if i wasn't on an expense account.", 
            "crap. indeed such crap it single handedly put me on a \"famous chef\" hiatus.  my wife and i went to carnevino just for a quick bite. we ordered of the taverna menu as we didn't want the full \"experience.\"\nthe menu came, dirty, stained, and torn; nasty. the server brought out \"a complement from the chef\" some cold, greasy, hush-puppy like dough ball. i asked if it were supposed to be warm and the server said \"yes.\" well, sorry to surprise you, it wasn't.\nwe ordered the <mark>Arugula Salad</mark>, tagliatelle <mark>Italian Broccoli with Garlic and Pork</mark>, and the house made <mark>House-Made Pastrami Sandwich</mark>. the <mark>Arugula Salad</mark> was in a bath of white vinegar and nearly inedible. the tagliatelle was salty enough to choke a cow and cows lick pure salt! but worse, far worse, worst of all, was the <mark>House-Made Pastrami Sandwich</mark>; two massive slabs of dry, crumbly bread, more arugula, and the thinnest of thin slices of pastrami. i didn't see any pastrami so i opened the sandwich removed a slice to taste the pastrami. i still don't know what it tastes like! the horseradish mustard overpowered everything. i combined the two halves of the sandwich into one and it still had less pastrami than a sandwich you'd find in a vending machine at a train station yet just as appetizing!\nfrom now on, if i don't see that damn famous chef in his/her restaurant, i'm not eating there. never, ever again.", 
            "one of the most unique steakhouses in vegas offering a rare culinary delight:  months aged dry aged beef.\n\nread on, i promise not to talk about what the process really is.\n\ncalled \"riserva\", the once usda prime beef is aged six to 11 months before being trimmed and served.  the result is unlike \"younger\", 30-75 day dry aged beef.  the shorter aged steaks retain a beefy texture, very tender with a pronounced nutty, bleu cheese aroma and flavor with a massive umame finish.  the months aged beef, think prosciutto.  broiled rare to mid rare at a low temperature.  there is no thick outer crust.  the flavor is mild and nutty with only the hint of bleu cheese aroma.  the beef is dense and oily.  it has a very different mouth feel.  it is extremely sweet.  amazing but not for everyone.\n\ntip:  request the \"riserva\" steaks when making reservation.  the amount of aging doesn't matter.  the piece is selected when it has reached the correct characteristics.\n\ntraditional dry aged steaks are excellent.  the rib eye <mark>Italian Broccoli with Garlic and Pork</mark> both possess the classic umame packed dry aged goodness.  excellent sear, tender and juicy.  both steaks are meant to be shared.  if dining alone, both the bone in <mark>Bone-In New York Strip</mark> and bone in <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> offer the same experience as the porterhouse in a more manageable 16oz portion.\n\nall steaks are rubbed with rosemary before cooking.  it imparts a strong, woodsy flavor that enhances the sweetness of the beef.\n\nnot into aged beef?  the 20oz bone in veal chop is excellent.  natural, pasture raised veal, it has a light beef flavor with a soft texture.  it's dry rubbed with thyme <mark>Italian Broccoli with Garlic and Pork</mark> powder that imparts a very flavorful earthy goodness.  a drizzle of fresh olive oil adds the perfect richness.\n\nfor starters, the <mark>Fried Calamari</mark>, \"shrimp alla diavola\", and bucatini amatriciana are excellent but why fill up.  you can get these at batali's italian eatery, b&b ristorante.\n\nthe restaurant captures the spirit of italy, an enjoyable, casual, jovial evening.  don't go with an elegant stick up your, you know.  the bread will make your hands oily and gnawing the bone is encouraged.\n\nbravo!", 
            "my first batali/bastianich experience and unfortunately it'll probably be my last. there's very little good i could find in my experience at carnevino. first, the service was horrendous. after ordering a bottle of wine, the waiter poured us a glass, then took the bottle away from the table where we were left waiting 20-25 minutes for someone to bring it back to fill up an empty glass. we also had to ask for a basket of bread after realizing all the other tables except ours received one upon arriving. \n\nfood:\n\ntagliatelle <mark>Italian Broccoli with Garlic and Pork</mark> trifolati: sauce was decent, pasta was overcooked. in a restaurant that's owned by these 2? weird.\n\ngrilled sweetbreads: saved this place from getting 1 star. this dish was awesome. if you find yourself here and you like sweetbreads i'd highly recommend them. \n\n16 oz <mark>Bone-In New York Strip</mark>:  four people at our table ordered it medium rare and they all came cooked a different way. truly surprising and really unacceptable. one of the steaks felt and tasted like it had been sitting for at least 30 minutes. when we brought the inedible steak up to the waiter he didn't even blink when telling us we wouldn't be charged for it. the impression i got was that it happens all the time.\n\nin a place like vegas where every world-class chef has at least one restaurant i would absolutely go somewhere else. i guess you could chalk my story up to \"a bad night\" but it really was dreadful. i expected better from batali and bastianich.", 
            "i was staying at the venetian for a work conference and we're going through a late night dry-run with a couple colleagues when we got hungry around 8:30pm. we really wanted some steak and stopped by cut(?) first however their wait was 45 minutes. we called the concierge to see what our other options were for steak with a shorter wait time and she recommended carnevino. so off we went.\n\nthe restaurant itself is located away from restaurant row and through the casino in the palazzo. it had a nice ambiance, dim lighting and quite intimate with racks of their great wine selection on the walls. we grabbed a couple drinks while waiting to be seated and i got a moscow mule which was ok.\n\nonce seated we ordered the <mark>Fried Calamari</mark> which was pretty good. they brought out bread with two sides of butter <mark>Italian Broccoli with Garlic and Pork</mark> fat which they recommended mixing together before spreading it on the bread and oh my god it was delish. i mean pork fat and butter? c'mon. they also gave us complimentary mini bread rolls with cheese inside and it pretty much tasted like a crispy cheese ball which is amazing.\n\na colleague and i ordered the dry aged bone-in ribeye which has the option on menu to split between two for $72 each. we were unsure until our waiter told us this particular dish was in the running for the best steak in the country. so we pretty much were validated in our reasoning for getting it lol. another colleague got the <mark>Bone-In New York Strip</mark>. we also got the charred brussels sprouts and the saut\\u00e9ed mushrooms. \n\nthe waiters (yes, more than one) came and rolled out a table with the bone-in ribeye and holy mother of god was this thing huge. i mean i'm all of 5'1 and it could've knocked me out. they cut the entire dish in front of us and served it neatly sliced on our plates and then placed the bone in the middle of the table. ok time for the big taste...simply put it was the best steak i've ever had in my life. i mean perfectly seasoned and moist and melt in your mouth goodness. after getting over the massive bone just chillin on the table i savored every bite. the brussels sprouts were pretty good but i thought the mushrooms were very good. \n\nin addition i have to say what really gave my review the full five stars was the exceptional service. working in a field that pretty much values service i mean they were very at tentative. they took the time to explain everything to us, make sure we were comfortable, and checked on us regularly - even making sure to fold our napkins of we went to the bathroom. \n\ni had a really great experience here. good food, good company, good service. i left full and satisfied and honestly i would recommend this place if you are looking for a really great steak that you definitely don't mind splurging on.", 
            "my wife and i visited vegas for a weekend which meant we had to be selective about where to eat. we heard about carnevino and given the celebrity chefs involved and decent reviews we decided to give it a shot. \n\nupon arrival we were promptly seated. it took a minute for water to arrive but that was fine. the menus are ridiculously oversized, nearly 2 feet tall and 3 of the 4 pages are bottled wine. the menu is so large it's awkward to hold. more on the menu later. our young waiter was eager to help but slightly arrogant and trained to push you toward the more expensive options. he left us to review the menu. \n\none of their specials is listed on a smaller menu which consists of a multi meat tasting, i think it was 5 varieties, and a desert. no sides or salads included. of the 5 courses one had pasta. given that both celebrity chefs are italian we definitely wanted to try some pasta. the tasting is $150 per person while the matching wine pairing is $80 per person. add a couple sides and you are over $500 for a couple, which is fine, but the food and service better be top notch for there to be any value at this price. \n\nafter considering the tasting we decided against it mainly because we wanted more variety from the and thought selecting exactly what we wanted provided a better value. from the antipasta section we choose the <mark>Grilled Octopus</mark> and the beat salad. \n\nwe really struggled with choosing entrees and here is were the menu really became a hindrance and frustration. remember the menu is sized for a giant at nearly 2ft tall so holding it and talking with others at your table is a challenge. the entrees are broken down into pasta, veal, lamb, fish and red meat. the meat section which is what they are known for is in the middle and has 5 or 6 options. the signature steaks are the dry aged bone in ribeye and the porterhouse. the waiter made sure to point out the dry aged ribeye and explained the steaks are \"hand carved\" table side. sounds simple enough. the trouble began when the pricing for both of these meats were listed for 2 people, $152 for the ribeye and $170 for the porterhouse. since we really wanted to try the pasta this left us with a dilemma. we asked the waiter for assistance and he explained they could serve the ribeye for one at $95 but that the porterhouse was only served for 2. we asked for more time to decide. i love steak like anyone but $95 for a ribeye, even dry aged, is pricey. i asked the waiter how many oz. but he did not know and the menu does not specify sizes anywhere. ultimately we choose the ribeye for one and the beef cheek ravioli which the waiter highly recommended. \n\nthe bread arrived along with the butter <mark>Italian Broccoli with Garlic and Pork</mark> fat. the butter was excellent but i didn't care for the overly salty flavor of the fat. the appetizers arrived quickly and we really enjoyed both the octopus and the beats. if i'm being picky the octopus was slightly over cooked but we ate every piece.\n\nwhile waiting for the entrees to arrive we asked the waiter for wine recommendations with our entrees. he immediately recommended a glass of italian red wine without much hesitation. we are not wine experts and neither of us were familiar with the grape variety. we asked for a taste and he kindly brought a sample. the wine was not full bodied as he described although it was peppery and spicy, maybe he confused the two. my wife liked it and ordered a glass while i asked for something with make body, more tannins, like a cab. he brought a glass of a cab which worked out much better for me. given the importance of wine, 3 pages full on the menu, i was not impressed with the waiters knowledge. \n\nthe entrees took about the amount of time you would expect. the steak was rolled to the table on a cart for carving. one of my biggest disappointments was they never once asked if the steak was cooked to our liking. we ordered the ribeye medium but received medium rare, red throughout. i don't mind a rare steak, i order a filet rare but i prefer a ribeye cooked medium to allow the fat to loosen up more. since they already carved it and placed it on the table we choose to let it go rather than complain and delay the meal. if you've ever eaten at an eddie v's the ribeye will remind you of their tomahawk bone in ribeye. the steak was good had a unique flavor perhaps due to the dry age but i was not blown away. the value just wasn't there. if you are going to set my expectations with a lofty price then you better bring your a game. my wife sort of enjoyed the beef cheek ravioli but i thought it was awful. the pasta was good but the beef cheek filling had the texture of baby food and the flavor wasn't much better. i'm a texture guy so your mileage may vary. \n\nlong story short, high price, poor/average experience means no value. i recommend you look elsewhere in vegas. i debated between 2 or 3 stars but after thinking through our meal again i left it at a 2. harsh but fair given the expectations they set.", 
            "fantastic across the board. the ambiance and decor are upscale and relaxed. the service is impeccable, and the food and wine list are outstanding. we started with the <mark>Zach's Chopped Salad</mark> and <mark>Grilled Octopus</mark>. the <mark>Grilled Octopus</mark> was amazingly well executed. it had a nice char but was not overcooked or rubbery at all. highly recommended. next we had the grilled asparagus, spinach with bacon, <mark>Italian Broccoli with Garlic and Pork</mark> steak. the asparagus was nicely charred but still crisp and crunchy and the porterhouse was amazing. we decided to split the steak (portion for 2) among three because they looked huge. i'm glad we did. the steak was monstrous and with the sides easily fed three people. overall a great experience and highly recommended just be prepared to shell out some $$",

            "we had a fantastic experience with both service and food here last night! our server, diego, was prompt, knowledgeable, and kind. jimmy also helped our table and was super sweet and very quick to bring us anything we needed. loved them both. \n\n-beef cheek ravioli - fantastic. i could eat them by the handful. don't skip this. \n-fiorentina porterhouse for 2 - cooked perfectly medium rare and was a great size with everything else we ordered. one of the best flavored steaks we've had. \n\n** though the steak didn't need a sauce, we got the porcini bernaise and it was phenomenal. so tasty. \n\n-marscapone/guanciale mashed potatoes - super creamy and delicious. \n-brussel sprouts <mark>Italian Broccoli with Garlic and Pork</mark> belly - good, but not wow. ended up dipping these in the bernaise! \n\ngreat wine (loved the super tuscan and cab sav by the glass the most) and finished it off with an affogato. yum!",

            "i've never been much of a mario batali fan and after reading some of the reviews of carnevino i was a little apprehensive about trying it. but, i decided to give it a shot anyway and i'm thrilled that i did. i think it was the best steak i've ever had. now, i haven't been to any of the other big name steak houses in vegas, but from my limited experience at fine-dining steakhouses i do have to say that it was fabulous.\n\nthe restaurant looks very formal with it's high ceilings, dark wood, white linens, and ornate interior. and the service started off as very formal and a little cold. but by the end it was an extremely enjoyable experience all around (maybe the wine had something to do with that).\n\nthe beef tasting menu looked impressive, but we decided to order a la carte:\n- tuna crudo: thinly sliced pieces of tuna and yellowtail adorned one side of the plate and a stack of potatoes and radishes (?) with pomegranate seeds on the other. we had to construct each bite by putting the separate ingredients together.  it was a playful dish that was delicious and different. i could have eaten 2 or three of those things.\n\n- pappardelle: fresh pasta and tasty mushrooms. it was a perfect size for a pasta dish to share\n\n- <mark>Fregula, Pecorino Romano, Butternut Squash</mark>, fregola, and parmigano reggiano: a perfect side dish with great flavor.\n\n- sauteed mixed mushrooms: this was probably my least favorite dish of the night. the mushrooms were a little too chewy for my liking and too oily and buttery. \n\n- filet w/lobster: as other review mention, steaks are brought out on a cart and sliced in front of you. our server made the slicing and plating of it look effortless. they're very formal in the way that they do it, making sure to pick up the sliced filet using one hand holding both a fork and spoon (kinda like chop sticks). after the filet was plated, our server finished it off with a touch of salt and a little bit of olive oil. the filet was cooked perfectly (medium to medium rare), seasoned just right, and was the most tender cut of beef i've ever had. the lobster tasted great but wasn't mind-blowing.\n\n- desserts: we had two desserts. one was like a chocolate mousse... i don't remember the description... it was good but not spectacular. however, the second dessert was. the pumpkin-filled donuts were unbelievable! i wanted to eat a whole bowl full of those little guys. the donuts were warm and moist and the pumpkin filling was like eating the best pumpkin pie ever.\n\nour server, phoenix, was great. she gets high marks for not laughing at me as i mispronounced \"aragone\" and \"paperdelle.\" what can i say... i'm asian not italian. we ordered wine by the glass and she was a little heavy on the pour, which was an added bonus. it was a great experience all around... great food, service and wine. if you have left overs they'll give you a ticket so you can pick them up at the hostess station on the way out. if you're a local make sure you ask for the discount. we got 15% off our bill. woohoo!", 
            "the bf took me here for my birthday because mario batali is one of my favorite chefs and i have been to his other restaurant b&b as well as babbo in new york.  for drinks i chose the blood orange martini (yum), and the bf got a peroni beer (pretty good).  our waiter listed the specials and immediately i was set on the foie gras with freshly shaved white truffles (two off my obsession list).  glazed and perfectly tasty.  even at $50 a pop, i was tempted to get another!  i resisted and awaited my entree of lamb with a side of <mark>Fregula, Pecorino Romano, Butternut Squash</mark> and the seafood pasta.  my bf got the veal.  the lamb was surprisingly a large portion (3 double chops).  the pasta was not very good unfortunately... it did come with a good amount of seafood, which was overcooked and the pasta was a little too al dente for my taste.  my bf said the veal was ok.  the <mark>Fregula, Pecorino Romano, Butternut Squash</mark> side was not what i was expecting, but was good.  the bill came out to around $300 with tax and tip (we tipped about 25% - service was good and it's not his fault the food was bad!).  the foie gras was worth the trip, but maybe next time we will go to b&b or have the bf stick to the steak, which i hear is pretty good.   all in all, i was pretty disappointed, but then again, we did go to a steak house and did not get the steak.  or maybe i'm too spoiled by the amazing food in new york.", 
            "big big fan. another expensive meal in las vegas but this was truly exceptional and worth the $$. the decor is what would expect for mario - masculine, dark-ish, library-type walls, wine as far as the eye can see. really attractive. service was so enjoyable - a charming waiter who knew everything he should and then some. he stated he was from the south and his manners matched. if every server could be like him dining out would be so pleasurable all the time. to start - a carpaccio \"salad\" if you will. thins slices over arugula dressed with an amazing balsamic and some parmigiana reggiano. it was a special that evening and it was special. we had the orecchiette with sweet sausage and broccoli rabe and the potato gnocchi bolognese second. both were delicious. pasta done to perfection, sausage and bolognese both so flavorful and simple. next i had the 12 oz filet. she had the 20 oz bone-in chop. meat was cooked to perfection, perfect seasoning, and plating was beautiful. portion was equal to the price we both felt. for sides = mascarpone mashed potato and roasted <mark>Fregula, Pecorino Romano, Butternut Squash</mark>. the mashed potatoes are served with a poached egg on top that you break and then mix in. it's out-of-this-world delicious. i was just sad that there wasn't a larger dish of them. wine was amazing - the list is crazy extensive and our new southern friend navigated it with us very well. dessert was 3 flavors of gelato and a cappuccino. \nmario hits it out of the park again. can't wait to return.", 
            "okay - i hate to do this - but i can only give carnevino a three star rating. now, maybe i just had an off day, since everyone and their mother loves this place, but i did not love my meal. \n\nwe first started off with <mark>Fried Calamari</mark> and potato gnocchi bolognese to share. the calamari was good (not out of this world) and the gnocchis were a bit on the hard side. not what i expected. i am sure they were homemade, however they needed to be cooked just a tad bit more. \n\nfor my meal, i had the <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> and our table shared a number of different sides. as far as the filet is concerned, i asked for it to be medium rare and it was just plain old rare. so rare that i couldn't really eat it. i should have sent it back to be cooked a bit longer (my fault), however i didn't want to be \"that\" girl at the table. \n\nas far as the sides are concerned, the <mark>Fregula, Pecorino Romano, Butternut Squash</mark> dish was delicious. the spinach was a bit on the salty side. the mushrooms were a bit overcooked, they were just a little bit too crispy. \n\nthe dessert however was very good. we had the lemon cheesecake, assorted cookies, butter cream crepes and something else that i can't remember. my favorite would have to be the assorted cookies.\n\nas far as the staff is concerned, everyone was extremely friendly and attentive.", 
            "the first time i went to carnevino (last year) it was one of the best meals i've ever had. this time around the experience fell short.\n\nto start we ordered the <mark>Fried Calamari</mark> and the big eye tuna crudo. the calamari was excellent and the hot peppers in the dish added a good amount of heat without dominating the flavor. the tuna came with approximately eight small slices and were arranged in order of leanest to fattiest. all were delicious, especially the fatty ones. just don't expect large chunks of fish to come out if you order this dish.\n\nnext up was the black fettucine. served as a small portion, this is meant to be the equivalent of an appetizer. it sounded good when our waiter recommended it, because it came with crab, jalape\\u00f1os, and shallots. but the dish just didn't deliver. there wasn't much crab to speak of and the taste and overly-firm texture of the pasta was a turn off.\n\nfor our entrees, both couples ordered the dry aged bone-in ribeye for two. at $65 per person, it wasn't cheap but if was more than enough meat for all of us. they wheel it out on a cart and slice it tableside. the dish is finished with a touch of sea salt and olive oil. our ribeye was a slightly bloody medium rare as we ordered and absolutely delicious. they also leave the bone on the table which was one of the best parts of the meal. i wasn't going to be shy about trying it either. i picked it up and gnawed on it for a while, cleaning off all the meat i could. and, i have to say that the meat from the bone was the most flavorful and memorable bites of the night. as good as that steak was however, i prefer the ribeye at cut to this one. not only is it cheaper (per person), but the smaller and thinner cut of beef allowed for more seasoning and more of the crust on each bite.\n\nour sides were the sauteed mixed mushrooms with spring onions, brussels sprouts with pancetta, and a <mark>Fregula, Pecorino Romano, Butternut Squash</mark> dish with pine nuts and capers. all were amazing and the brussels sprouts were some of the best i've ever had.\n\nso, while i still think carnevino is an excellent restaurant, i would recommend it for the appetizers and sides (you can't go wrong with any of the ones we tried) but the pastas can be hit or miss. their <mark>Filet Mignon</mark>, which i had my previous visit, is amazing and still ranks as the best filet i've ever had. i'm still tempted to go back and try their porterhouse for two or their riserva steak -- aged for over a year.\n\n4.5 stars", 
            "i went here on christmas eve with my mom, and i just have to say it was one of the best meals i had ever had.\n\nthe location is a little bit awkward and unconventional, since it's split into two with the two areas being right near the slots and escalators. i didn't mind much, because it's not awfully noisy or terrible.\n\nour waiter was amazing. he was very professional, very quick, and he carved our steak with such elegance that i was actually, actually awe-struck.\n\nwe got the dry aged bone in ribeye (for two) with sauteed brussel sprouts and a seasonal side of <mark>Fregula, Pecorino Romano, Butternut Squash</mark>. the <mark>Fregula, Pecorino Romano, Butternut Squash</mark> was delightful; i had no complaints about that one. but, the sauteed brussel spouts were really delicious. they were cooked just right, and had a light crispy crunch to them, while at the same time, not being too greasy. \n\nonto the good part. i have to say, if you go to carnevino, you need to get the dry aged bone in ribeye. yeah, so it's $65 per person, but i would have to say it's totally worth it. they brought this ginormous thing of meat out on this wooden board over this dainty little cart. our waiter carved it right in front of us, and served it to us, arranging it nicely on our plates with wonderful presentation as if we weren't already impressed. when they were done, they left the giant bone on a plate for us and advised that the meat next to the bone is amazing. that we should try it. well, of course!\n\nalthough there was too much steak, and as much as i wanted to finish everything, i stuffed myself until i physically could just not fit any more meat into my stomach. i did end up trying the meat off the bone. it was divine. not only was the texture different, but the taste was different from the rest!\n\nwe also asked our waiter for a wine suggestion. he poured us a nice glass of cabernet, which went amazingly with the beef.\n\ni'm confident about this place enough to say that it was probably the best meal i have ever, ever had. and i've had many meals in my lifetime.", 
            "***carnevino is expensive, but the meat choices (like the <mark>Bone-In New York Strip</mark> and veals chops) as well as the grill octopus and lobster ravioli are very good***\n\nwhile i am not a big fan of las vegas restaurants, mario batali's carnevino definitely excels at putting out great meat dishes.  we had several of their meat offerings including the <mark>Bone-In New York Strip</mark> and the veal chop and both were very good.\n\nthe <mark>Bone-In New York Strip</mark> was a thick cut and it had a great crispy outside sear, which was flavorful.  the meat was very tender.  it was undercooked at rare, but it still had a good flavor (and was of course moist).\n\nthe veal chop was better.  it was also very thick, but it was cooked more appropriately.  veal chops should be between medium rare and medium and this one was.  the meat was moist and tender while the outside crust was distinct and flavorful.  veal can often be a tad bland, but this one had a good flavor.  this was probably the best veal chop i have ever had.\n\nthe <mark>Lamb Chops</mark> were just okay.  unlike the other meats, the <mark>Lamb Chops</mark> were not that thick.  they were a tad overcooked and while they did have a decent flavor and were tender, they were just not as juicy as they should have been.  also, the outside crust was not as good as the veal or the <mark>Bone-In New York Strip</mark>.\n\nwe had two other dishes that were also very good.  one was their <mark>Grilled Octopus</mark>.  i've heard batali's <mark>Grilled Octopus</mark> at osteria mozza is very good.  this one was exceptional.  the octopus was very soft (which can be difficult with octopus) and it had a great flavor.  there were some good pickled vegetables on the side and maybe something else like prosciutto to give it a nice savory flavor.\n\ni have not enjoyed many of batali's pastas, but i did like his lobster anolini.  the lobster filled ravioli was very good--moist with a great lobster flavor.  the cream sauce was mixed with tarragon and it was flavorful and fragrant without being overly buttery or rich.\n\nmost of the other items were in the just okay range.  the <mark>Arugula Salad</mark> featured a triple cream, but the triple cream was surprisingly dry and a little hard.  the bruschetta was okay (as was the big eye tuna crudo).\n\nwe had the pappardelle <mark>Italian Broccoli with Garlic and Pork</mark> mushrooms and while the pasta sheets were good, the pasta went cold quickly.  it was also a little bland.  i was expecting the braised pork agnolotti to have a more impactful filling, but it was not as moist or savory as i was hoping for.  the garnish of chanterelles was good though.  there was a little bit of <mark>Fregula, Pecorino Romano, Butternut Squash</mark> on the plate, but it did not provide the sweet flavor i was expecting.\n\nmost of the sides were just okay (like the spinach and the roasted beets), but the mashed potatoes with mascarpone and a poached egg were rich, creamy and quite good.\n\ni had the flourless chocolate cake for dessert and it was okay.  i am not the biggest fan of flourless chocolate cake because it can be too dry.  while it was a little bit dry, it had a good (but maybe not great) chocolate flavor.\n\nservice was good.  the staff was attentive and the food came out at a good pace.\n\nprices were high (which is common in las vegas), but when you share several of their dishes (family style), you might be able to save a little bit of money.\n\ncarnevino has very high ceilings and a loud atmosphere.  the place has the look of other expensive steakhouses--kind of masculine looking with lots of dark browns.\n\nthe meat at carnevino is very good and it is up there with some of the best a la carte steakhouses i've tried.  i am not the biggest fan of these steakhouses, but carnevino is one of the better ones and they even have a few other good things (like the lobster ravioli) to balance out the meal.\n\ncarnevino is located in the palazzo, which has free parking (valet or self).", 
            "even my mom was impressed with carnevino...and that's a high standard to meet.\n\nwe came here with a group of 7. the gm came out and personally greeted us at the hostess stand when he heard our party had arrived. they had a beautiful table set up all the way in the back of the restaurant (through the wine cellar room, which i thought would have been a cool place to sit as well). with very high ceilings and paintings on the wall, the back room felt like we were in someone's old world castle. it was quiet, romantic and i loved the ambiance. needless to say, service was absolutely impeccable. \n\nsome of us started with bellinis. the chef also sent out some complimentary apertifs. our food order was massive:\n\nappetizers:\n-caprese salad\n-stracciatela (proscuitto and mozz)\n-<mark>Grilled Octopus</mark> served over octopus sashimi (my favorite, the <mark>Grilled Octopus</mark> really was perfectly prepared and so tender)\n-steamed clams (the broth was soooo amazing)\n-lobster with the tail served sashimi style\n\npasta:\n-garganelle bolognese (because i was craving some sort of spicy pasta i requested the bolognese sauce to be made spicy and the chef added a very nice amount of heat)\n-orrechiette \n-beef agnolotti\n\nentrees:\n-dry aged bone-in ribeye (for 2 people) this thing was massive, i will upload a pic. we took the gigantic bone home for my mom's teacup malteses. so spoiled.\n-<mark>Filet Mignon</mark>\n-<mark>Lamb Chops</mark>\n-bison (available on their special menu)\n*note that the meat prepared at carnevino is prepared a little less than requested. for example, if you request medium rare, it will come out closer to rare.\n\nsides:\n-spinach\n-mashed potatoes\n-<mark>Fregula, Pecorino Romano, Butternut Squash</mark>\n-cauliflower gratin\n-porcini mushrooms\n\ni tried little bites of everything. we were all so full that dessert could not even be considered. the service and food were absolutely outstanding and i can't wait to experience carnevino again soon.", 
            "best steak ever!!!  yes, it was pricey, but so worth it!  we ordered the only thing on the menu that should be ordered - the aged bone-in ribeye.  side dishes - who cares.  we had the <mark>Fregula, Pecorino Romano, Butternut Squash</mark> rissoto and it was nothing to write home about.  the dinner comes with bread and two kinds of butter - butter and butter with fat and the fat is good!  there are sauces you can choose to add on to the steak, i.e. truffle sauce, etc.  we did not do that, the steak was amazing on its own.  they cut up the steak and explained each part to us.  the presentation was nice and the atmosphere was nice.  wait staff was pleasant and even encouraged me to munch on the bone with my bare hands and yes i did it - some of the best morsels were on that bone.  it was around $75/person and the total bill with wine, side dish, and dessert was $200.00 - not too shabby for a once a year splurge.  there are a lot worse things to spend $200 on.  my husband and i were happy and stuffed.  definitely going back next year!"

            "on our last trip to vegas my friend and i had seen carnevino on our way to table 10 and after a quick glimpse of the menu had made it a point to visit on our next trip.\n\non a recent long weekend we decided to hit up carnevino on saturday night. so much on the menu looked tempting but we both ended up opting for the 8 oz. <mark>Filet Mignon</mark>. to compliment our steaks we chose two sauces, myself choosing the porcini bernaise which was the perfect accompaniment to my tender and scrumptious steak. the steak was juicy and cooked perfectly! the sauce was not a thick consistency, i would liken it to a thicker au jus. for our sides we chose the <mark>Tuscan Fries</mark>- made with fingerling potatoes roasted with parmesan and herbs and parmesan/potato cakes (i can't remember their name!)- mashed potatoes mixed with parmesan cheese and deep fried into a small yummy cake. so good!\n\nafter dinner we were full! but my friend wanted to see if they had an olive oil gelato she had had in batali's ny restaurant. to her dismay they didn't. however, we asked our server (rather our server's assistant) and he took the extra step and put our request into the chef. to our surprise the chef accomodated our request! a few minutes later our server brought out our olive oil gelato. what yummy goodness! smooth and sweet vanilla gelato, light and fruity olive oil and crushed sea salt. an unusual combination but so delicious! a must try! \n\nour dinner overall was a great dining experience. the service was professional, friendly, attentive and courteous. the food was brought out timely, hot and delicious! the fact that one of our servers made a special request and was able to deliver just made the dinner that much more enjoyable and the reason i gave this review 5 stars!", 
            "warning: if you want to be able to eat here and live with yourself, you'll have to dumb yourself down a bit and pretend you don't understand the word \"lardo\" when you read it on the menu. are you ready? good.\n\nthat said . . . helloooooo, beef carpaccio with \"warm lardo crostini.\" loved that this was one of the pre-theater menu antipasti offerings. so delicious. \n\ni have to admit, i was less slightly less charmed by my main course -- the pappardelle <mark>Italian Broccoli with Garlic and Pork</mark>, served with a fresh grating of parmesano-reggiano (chef's suggestion) -- than i was with the first. it's hard to follow a tender meat-and-lardo pairing with truffles and pasta, no matter how perfectly al dente that pasta may be. \n\nit is even more difficult -- if not impossible -- to then be delighted by a simple gelato/sorbet. the texture doesn't follow, the flavor doesn't quite match; nothing is really right about the arrangement.\n\nso i left with mixed feelings about carnevino. on the one hand, my departing taste was that of bland, \"espresso\"-flavored gelato (flavor not really recommended). on the other hand, it's nearly a week later, and i still drool every time i think about the carpaccio or the delightful <mark>Tuscan Fries</mark> my husband had with his filet. perhaps skipping the dessert would just be your best option.", 
            "omg, the food here is insanely delicious!  love the attentive but not smuthering service.  the ciabatta bread is one of my fav, besides the steak of course... beef capaccio, mmmm mmmm melts in your mouth good, and the date cake is out of this world!!! a few things however, were so so... i'd definitely think twice about ordering the following sides- <mark>Tuscan Fries</mark> sure had the yummy garlic smell, but isn't as tasty as it smelled, then the poached egg mascarpone mashed potatoes, ok but again, nothing extraordinary, though good to try since it's a bit different, the cheese balls were too salty and the nougets, omg were too sweet!  would defintely dine there again!  ask for mark, he was a great host", 
            "a delicious meal with some wonderful friends made for an awesome christmas eve dinner.\n\nwhat i ate:\n- bread was ciabatta rolls. came out with rosemary lardo and sweet butter. the ciabatta rolls were yummy and oily. i loved the rosemary lardo, but i was the only one at the table who liked it. tasted like yummy rosemary flavored fat! whats not to like?!\n- rib eye for two: omg, perfection! just enough fat to make it tasty, tender and juicy. cooked to perfection. they carved the huge fred flinstone sized steak table side and drizzled our plates with some extra virgin olive oil. the lady at the other table straight up picked up the huge rib bone and actually gnawed on it. shes kind of my hero.\n- porcini bearnaise sauce: yummy yummy. rich and deep mushroom flavor. pretty awesome and oh so fatty. \n- bison: perfection. i really loved the bison!!! didnt taste gamey at all! soooooooo tender and perfectly made\n- parpadelle: delicious! fresh pasta! wonderful flavors of mushroom\n- sauteed brussel sprouts w/pancetta (side): not a fan of brussel sprouts in general so this wasnt the best for me \n- italian broccoli w/house smoked pork (side): good\n- spinach w/garlic and hot peppers (side): loved this. the hot peppers gave this a nice kick\n- cesare's '<mark>Tuscan Fries</mark>' (side): basically potato wedges with garlic and parm.\n- white truffle pasta dish. im sorry, i didnt order it so i wasnt sure what it was called, but it was one of the specials for the day. this was so disappointing. you ate and tried so hard to love it, but there was nothing to love. you think white truffles and you expect to get your socks knocked off, but nothing happened after a bite. it wasnt that the dish was bad, it was nice and buttery and rich, but it wasnt outstanding. totally not worth the $50 that came with it so we sent it back. \n- cheese plate: not on the menu! but we asked, and our server said they could whip something up. came out with a blue cheese, double cream goat cheese, parm, pecorino, pear slices, and i asked our server to give us some almonds and some crostini.\n\npros:\n- the meat! all the meat was cooked to perfection. i cant speak for anything else, but if its a steakhouse, i highly suggest sticking to the meat! if you cant wrangle someone else to share the rib eye with you, go for the bison!\n- service: fairly attentive and outrageously polite and sooooooo accommodating! they let us move when we didnt like the first table we were placed. they were so polite when we complained about the white truffle dish and replaced it quickly. there was always quick and attentive refills of all our water and wine glasses. i asked if they had a cheese plate and they said no, but our server said they would whip something up for us. when i asked for almonds to come out with our cheese plate, he was more than happy to bring us some. \n\ncons:\n- the sides were ... unimpressive. they were tasty, but at $9 a pop, i was expecting a bit more. maybe we picked the wrong sides. \n- white truffle pasta dish. my review of it is above.\n- empty! on our way to the bathroom i was so surprised to see how empty the restaurant was. i guess with all the high end dining available in vegas, its difficult to compete. \n\nwould i come again? ... maybe. but, i think id prefer trying another place out on my next vegas trip.", 
            "glad i went with two other people.  this is a restaurant you want more people so you can try more of their menu.  \n\nfor three people we ordered potato gnocchi bolognese (good), duck cannelonni (strange flavor), dry-aged bone in ribeye (dinosaur bone, fun to watch them cut tableside, but lacked flavor), brussel sprouts & pancetta (good) and <mark>Tuscan Fries</mark> (salty, seasoned potatoes) and for dessert a sorbetti (quince (basically lemon), blood orange, and pear) i would have preferred to get two scoops of the pear to one of the lemon or blood orange, but it was the perfect ending to the meal.  \n\nservice was excellent!  explanation of menu was great.  the progression of food was perfect.  the servers did not seem to rush us, even though it was saturday night.  for that i'd give them 5 stars.  \n\nit's definitely a restaurant for wine lovers.  too bad i'm not one.  \neveryone seemed happy- servers and patrons.  glad i tried it!", 
            "** i somehow just discovered that i had an 'unfinished review' that i started at least a year ago. wow. i'll portion off the section i wrote originally, and continue below it. **\n\n-----------original------------\ni've eaten here twice, about 18 months apart. both times, i noted that the ribeye was one of the best steaks i've ever enjoyed.\n\na couple days ago, i took my dad and my roommate here for dinner. they seated us despite sandals, caps, and general raggedness, as we'd spent the whole day moving to a new condo. service was impeccable and friendly. most notably, the timing of the servers' trips to the table was flawless. my dad and i shared a ribeye for two with black pepper horseradish sauce, while my roommate had an 8oz <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> with the same sauce. we all shared sides of romana beans and <mark>Tuscan Fries</mark>. everything was amazing.\n\nmy roommate and i got beers, of which they have a nice selection of imports, but my dad stuck with water, having to drive back to la right after dinner.\n\nall dishes were excellent. they did, however, play an entire rolling stones album during the meal. that was fairly annoying.\n-------------------------------------\n\nah yes. i have now eaten here three times, another shortly after the recount above. i took both of my parents and my roommate back only a couple months later, and had another fantastic meal. even fewer little details to complain about this time.\n\nmy mom is allergic to cow's milk, so sometimes it's a challenge for a restaurant to avoid all dishes with butter or milk used in any stage of the prep - especially butter. but this place handled it marvelously, customizing everything for her with no issues. and the server immediately understood what her request was, which is a rare mark of quality in our experience.\n\nyet again, this meal was tremendous. we did order red wine this time around, which, in my opinion, is just-about imperative at a nice steakhouse. unfortunately, they didn't have my favorite spanish red in stock, but the sommelier reccomended a very nice and affordable bottle that we all enjoyed.\n\ni'm rambling. this steakhouse kicks serious butt. every side is classic, rustic, and delicious. never too salty, sweet, cheesy, or anything strong enough to take away from the relatively subtle flavors of aged steaks. the wine and beer selections are top-notch. service is immaculate. and the steaks...you'd contemplate killing your best friend to get one of their steaks on your plate.\n\nbut man...the music. it's consistently annoying. it's probably just me and there are probably a lot of people who either don't notice or enjoy it, so i'm not making much of a point about it. but i am docking a star.\n\nhighly recommended!", 
            "after spending so many years in the restaurant industry i thought i had a good understanding of what a steak house should be. i have never been so wrong in my life! carnevino from the service to the execution of each plate was nothing less then perfect.\n\nmy fiancee and i were amazed at just how attentive and just how perfectly the staff worked together to take care of not only us but each table.\n\nour dining experience started off with <mark>Tagliata di Manzo</mark> arugula, parmigiano drizzled with ages balsamic and the <mark>Grilled Octopus</mark> pickled vegetables and limoncello. the bar was set high with these first offerings and only got better and better with the progression of each course.\n\nwe moved on to our pasta course. we had \nricotta and egg raviolo with brown butter. i have to say that each bite was blissful and decadent. it's one of those dishes you will think about long after its gone. we also had the beef cheek raviolis with aged balsamic. the plate was all to quickly bare and i just wanted more!!\n\nnow we come to the meat which is the realm of one of the most talented chefs i know adam perry lang. \n\n                                  ( bbl beef\n\nour all natural bbl beef is hand selected and aged in our meat chamber by our man adam perry lang. bbl beef is often beyond regular usda prime standards for marbling and flavor and is hormone and antibiotic free. we rub all of our beef with sea salt, black pepper and fresh rosemary to get a delicious and slightly charred crust.)\n\nmy fianc\\u00e9e chose the filet i had the \n<mark>Bone-In New York Strip</mark> 16 oz dry aged bbl beef. \nto co-star with our steaks we ordered the porcini bearnaise, mascarpone & guanciale mashed potatoes, <mark>Tuscan Fries</mark> and \"creamed\" corn with <mark>Chopped Pickled Peppers</mark>. \n\nto begin with the steaks are masterfully carved for you table side then sprinkled with finishing salt and drizzled with olive oil. to say my steak was good would be not only one of the greatest understatements of my life but it would be sacrilege. it was prefectly cooked and it melted in my mouth. the co-stars or sides just seem to enhance what we were consuming. my favorite were the mashed potatoes maybe because of the yolk or because of the bacon either way everything was incredible.\n\nour dining journey ended with caramel panna cotta caramelized bananas, raspberries as well as \nplum, peach and mango sorbeti. \n\nthis is one of those places that will change the way you look at food and is an experience you must have at least once.",

            "if you do not care for good service this is the place for you.  it is sad that a place with mario's name attached could be so lacking in service.  it is clear that he does not spend any time in the restaurant.\n\ni almost forgot but bread was never brought to our table.  maybe this is standard here???\n\nwe came for a birthday dinner & decided to have cocktails instead of wine.  our waiter managed to offer us a total of 2 drinks, one before the meal & one during the middle of the main course.  appetizers,  salads and first course, be damned!!!  you do not need no stinking cocktails...  maybe there is not enough of a markup for them to try to get you to drink a lot of cocktails.  it seemed like $12 for a drink was a money making enterprise...\n\nwho cares about service & beverages we are here for the food anyway.  the food was amazing, bravo to mario & kitchen staff.  if only the rest of the restaurant was as good as this.  at least they have something to strive for.  if it was up to me they would all be looking for new work.  i am sure the existing staff could get a job @ chili's or applebee's.\n\nappetizer: duck egg & pastrami over a bed of asparagus.\n     whatever disappointment i had in the staff was quickly forgotten as this was a tasty treat.\n\n1st course: bucatini all'amatriciana\n     again this felt like mario had prepared it himself.  this is why i am such a big fan of his.  i almost changed my order to order a larger portion of this as my main course.  i was even tempted to order it to go for a late night snack.  i was told that the pastas were all hand made.  it would not surprise me, this was perfect.  easily the best past i ever had.\n\nmain entre: ny strip with bone.  i added the <mark>Gorgonzola Mascarpone</mark> sauce.\n     this was aged to perfection & my taste buds eruppted as a river of flavor engulfed them.\n\ndesert: flourless chocolate cake with a chocolate sauce on the inside.\n     this was the one disappointing part of the food.  usually these are made to order & are very hot as the chocolate oozes out of the cake when you cut it.  there was no oozing here as the cake was warm & not hot enough for the chocolate to spill out of it.  it was still very good but clearly not made to order, or perhaps it was.  you never know with this waitstaff.", 
            "a lot of mixed reviews on this one. some 3s, some 5s. i'll go with the middle option. here's why:\n\nstarting with the food: the complimentary parmesan balls that a few other yelpers have mentioned are delicious, and a nice small start to what ended up being a really great meal. appetizers shared by the table included the <mark>Insalata Romana</mark> and a daily special which consisted of a baked bread topped with burrata and ramps. the special was quite tasty -- the ramps provided a very subtle complement to the burrata. the salad, on the other hand, comes with anchovies that overpowered everything else about the salad.\n\na friend and i split the florentine porterhouse which was delicious - very nice crusting on the outside and cooked to a excellent-looking medium rare on the inside. really didn't think it could get any better until the friend, who had been previously and gotten the same cut, ordered the additional <mark>Gorgonzola Mascarpone</mark> (one of around six sauce options). amazing. this definitely elevated the porterhouse a few steps and i now consider it the best steak i've ever had. the grilled spinach with hot peppers provided a nice spicy vegetable side which had just the right amount of kick without leaving you with an aftertaste that might otherwise interfere with the steak.\n\nso why, with all that, am i giving mario's steakhouse a four star review? a  few annoyances: first, the service was just average with a few missteps along the way; the biggest problem came when the steak florentine presentation came out. we had ordered medium rare and the steak was indeed medium rare. however, the line chef had written medium on the ticket and our waiter announced what the chef had written. we caught this and let them know we definitely wanted the medium rare. they went and double checked, but in between they had to roll the whole presentation tray back in, pretty humorous but a bit odd. next, the   atmosphere seemed off. from what i glanced quickly on my way out, they may have another (possibly main) dining room in the other half of the restaurant, but our party was placed in the other side of the split which was open-air to the casino. now i love my hometown, and the palazzo has a very good smoke filtration system, so it's not that bad, but i can't for the life of me figure out any reason you'd want the noises and scenery of the casino right there. it really seems like an odd and definitely annoying choice.\n\nso because of all that, and the fact that they couldn't seem to do a $18 salad right. four stars.", 
            "i dined at mario batali's and joe bastianich's carnevino recently at the palazzo with my wife and son, and the dry-aged bone-in ribeye was the very best steak i have ever tasted--and i have sampled quite a few on my quest to find the finest steak in las vegas.  in fact, i supped at santa fe station's charcoal room and del frisco's double eagle steakhouse within two weeks of my venture to carnevino, and at n9ne inside palms and union within aria at city center not long afterward.  all four dining establishments served excellent, well-prepared steaks--but not on a par with what carnevino produced.  the same is true of earlier ventures to emeril lagasse's delmonico steakhouse in the neighboring venetian and golden steer on sahara avenue near the stratosphere.  thus far, stripsteak at mandalay bay comes the closest.  when chewing on the tender morsels of medium-rare meat, carnevino's dry-aged ribeye yielded deep, rich, pleasing, and penetrating bursts of flavor that is difficult to describe in words, and the pasta that preceded it (potato gnocchi bolognese and pappardelle noodles with a delicate mushroom sauce) was very clean-tasting and refined.  i hope to return for lunch there soon just to savor the pasta again.  one can only eat steak so often before the body's cholesterol level will jump skyward!  but the well-aged ribeye at carnevino will definitely be experienced again after a respectable break.  it is something to savor more than once, and to treasure each time. \n\ncomplimentary doughy cheese puff balls were an appreciated amuse-bouche from the chef.  but i still prefer butter on my warm bread to offered lardo.  bearnaise sauce was excellent; <mark>Gorgonzola Mascarpone</mark> less so only because its strong flavor tended to dominate rather than harmonize with the meat.  warm apple fritters served with refreshing vanilla bean and chocolate gelato topped off a great meal.  i am glad that we took the advice of our server to place only a single order for two of dry-aged bone-in ribeye, which yielded about 40 ounces of meat.  this amount of prime beef proved to be more than adequate to feed three hungry diners-especially with two pastas and two vegetable sides to share.  ambiance was that of a clubby, white-table-clothed steakhouse in a spacious setting that featured a labyrinth of rooms; and service was friendly, helpful, and attentive.  although very expensive, carnevino will serve up a most memorable and satisfying meal!",

            "kind of surprised at the only 3-star rating for carnevino by the yelp peeps. i totally would agree with that for the other batoli restaurant, b&b, but carnevino really is outstanding. everything in vegas is overpriced, but this one doesn't seem out of place, like mix las vegas. for what you're getting, it seems solid. carnevino has since replaced craftsteak at mgm as our favorite steak place in vegas (although you can, perhaps surprisingly, get a great filet at mon ami gabi).\n\nwhat we like about carnevino is the great florentine steakhouse approach. it's a great grill, and feels comfortable, not over the top like many places in vegas. the caprese here is the best i've had outside of italy or homemade (which doesn't sound like it should be hard; but there are a lot of bad capreses out there). black fettuccine and the bucatini allamatriciana (one of my favorites) are solid starters on your way to the main course. the meat portions are big, and typically, my wife and i split the 12 oz filet, but the \"fiorentina\" experience is also memorable. don't forget the  <mark>Black Truffle Vinaigrette</mark>.\n\nalso, slight warning for you coffee people. they don't do house-brewed. your closest bet will be an americano, so if you don't know what that is, don't expect the folgers.",
