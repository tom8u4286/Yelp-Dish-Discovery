            "i had my hopes of trying pink's <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> for the longest time, and i finally tried it here at planet hollywood's race & sports book. \n\nooooooo... what a disappointment!\n\nit was just a small little stand with one worker who looked like he didn't want to be there!\n\ni ordered a regular <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> combo, which came with chips, that cost $5.95. the <mark><mark><mark><mark>Nacho Cheese</mark> <mark>Polish <mark>Bacon Chili <mark>Polish <mark>Brooklyn Pastrami <mark>Swiss Cheese</mark> Dog</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark> combo was $6.95. it just tasted like a regular <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark>, except that it had a nice \"snap\" to it (which made me give the place an extra star!). other than that, nothing special about it. the chili tasted like crap on it, probably because it was old and in the container all day! ewww! actually, i bet all the food they served there was old! ekkkk! =o\n\ni had asked the guy working there when they will be opening the actual official stand, and he said he wasn't sure. however, they will be opening one near the hawaiian tropic entrance of planet hollywood. sooo..look out! hopefully by that time, <mark>The Showgirl Dog</mark> will be better...", 
            "decent. if you've been to the original la location, prepare to be somewhat disappointed. \n\nfood: meh. <mark>The Showgirl Dog</mark> seemed precooked, the buns were plain, and the mushrooms looked canned. the <mark>Planet Hollywood Dog</mark> was damn near $8 alone. i had to ask for a side of <mark>Nacho Cheese</mark>, because the ph dog here only comes with a slice of what looked like kraft cheese. the prices were at least $2 more than the la location, but i guess its understandable since its las vegas. the fries weren't freshly prepared like the la location either. and to top it off, they didn't have grape crush soda or yoo-hoo like the la location. \n\nservice: the cashier chicks were nice. <mark>The Showgirl Dog</mark> and sides were served up/made in assembly line unlike the personal attention you get from one person at the la location. \n\noverall, it was just meh. i'd rather drive 4 hours, then wait in line for another hour to have an authentic pink's <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark>. i probably won't come back here unless they somehow manage to replicate everything that the la location offers. this place seemed like the \"mcdonalds\" version of pink's. the only good thing is that they accept credit cards, while the la location is only accepts cash.", 
            "what?!  pink's in vegas??\n\ni was so excited to see that they opened a pink's which is located at planet hollywood, just outside and facing the strip.  to my surprise, there wasn't a huge 1 hour line.  i also saw that they didn't have the extensive menu that they have in their original west hollywood location. \n\n i had heard so many great things about this place that i had to check it out.  i had a dog with their famous chili, <mark>Nacho Cheese</mark>, onions and jalape\\u00f1os.   just like they brag, the <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> does have a nice snap to it and flavor.  and they steam their buns.  next to a fenway park frank, these were pretty damn good and would definitely go back!\n\ntip #1: can't find your favorite pink's <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark>?  just ask and have them customize your favorite creation.", 
            "i was super excited that this past weekend, i got to have pinks in las vegas. it's there people's, but it's located on the outside corner of planet hollywood\n\npros: \n-pinks's was vegas out,,,,super bright pink signs\n-didn't even have to wait in line\n-quick food for vegas\n- yummy bacon\n-order of fries is automatically seasoned, yumo!\n\ncons:\n-it's too hot to eat outside in vegas during summer, we took our food into the planet hollywood mall and ate at the tables near fat tuesday's\n-canned mushrooms\n-didn't like the taste of the <mark>Polish <mark>Bacon Chili <mark>Polish <mark>Brooklyn Pastrami <mark>Swiss Cheese</mark> Dog</mark></mark></mark></mark> here \n-scaled down menu from the original\n\n***so i still haven't found the right dog for me at pink's la or lv, but i'd definitely give it a another shot**\n\nbut honestly....i still love my sf mission bacon wrapped <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> (with <mark>Grilled Onion</mark> from the carts)  and costco <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> (super duper cheap) way better.", 
            "this place is meh times twenty. i've had a better <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> from the refrigerator section at the grocery store. \n\ni would definitely skip this place all together. although all the glitz and glam of the pinks restaurant sign and ambiance is nice, it is so not worth digesting this <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark>. \n\ni ordered the <mark>Chicago <mark>Polish <mark>Brooklyn Pastrami <mark>Swiss Cheese</mark> Dog</mark></mark></mark> and the bf ordered the <mark><mark><mark>Nacho Cheese</mark> <mark>Polish <mark>Bacon Chili <mark>Polish <mark>Brooklyn Pastrami <mark>Swiss Cheese</mark> Dog</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark>. both were forgettable and <mark>The Showgirl Dog</mark> did not have a lot of flavor, such a bummer. the total of two <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> and one large drink was $20, so not worth it. \n\ni am guessing this is not the pink's of la, because that pink's has a much better reputation than this two star joint.", 
            "ok it was like 107 degrees in vegas when i visited and pinks only offer outdoor seating. \n\nsucky seating aside, the food is way overrated.  i mean like $6 for a nothing special <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark>... that's ridics even for vegas.  my <mark><mark><mark><mark>Nacho Cheese</mark> <mark>Polish <mark>Bacon Chili <mark>Polish <mark>Brooklyn Pastrami <mark>Swiss Cheese</mark> Dog</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark> was bitter, and <mark>The Showgirl Dog</mark> itself is skinny, and tastes like any dog you can get in the deli section of safeway.  \n\ni will not eat here again.", 
            "it was pretty exciting to try pink's for the very first time. but my sis said this location is $3-$4 more per item compared to the la location. not only that, but the menu is shorter and the specials are not the same. the good thing is, there's no crazy hour wait like in la. \n\nhad the vegas strip <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark>. two <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark>, served with chili, mustard, guacamole and jalapenos. very tasty, but a bit on the heavy side. especially in 100+ degree weather since there's only outdoor seating. sis had the bacon <mark><mark><mark>Nacho Cheese</mark> <mark>Polish <mark>Bacon Chili <mark>Polish <mark>Brooklyn Pastrami <mark>Swiss Cheese</mark> Dog</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark>, which was pretty good too. gotta love chili! had a bite of the <mark>Pastrami Burrito</mark>. now that was just weird. <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark>, pastrimi, chili, cheese and onions. odd combo and taste. pass. lastly, their fries were very good. seasoned and crispy, just the way i like it. \n\nafter combo-ing my <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark>, it came out to like $12! wow. that's some expensive <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> that i couldn't even finish. not because it was big, but it was just too difficult to eat in that hot weather.", 
            "so i've never been to the pink's in la.  i'm not a big fan of <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark>, so waiting in line for an hour + does not sound enticing at all.\n\nno lines at the one in vegas!  that and not wanting to eat two hours at a buffet led us to pink's.  located right next to the miracle mile @ planet hollywood, this place only has outdoor seating, under giant umbrellas.  it would have been nicer if it wasn't 100+ degrees that day, but i digress.\n\n$17.30 gets you a spicy mojave and a planet hollywood (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/uqb9ks7lzesghltmuunmea?select=ku-m_3hod0dxaty6-8yqnq).  warning, the spicy mojave is not for the weak.  those jalapenos can kick your taste <mark>Bud</mark> in the butt!", 
            "pink's is one of those over-hyped places and since this location is in vegas, also super over-priced! it was located right outside the planet hollywood hotel and wasn't hard to find with its bright, pink name etched on the glass. at least there was no line at all when we got there. only outdoor seating so refrain from getting anything too spicy in the humid weather.\n\nit was $6.75 for my bacon <mark><mark><mark>Nacho Cheese</mark> <mark>Polish <mark>Bacon Chili <mark>Polish <mark>Brooklyn Pastrami <mark>Swiss Cheese</mark> Dog</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark>...not really worth it especially when the ones at the original pink's in la cost almost half that. it was topped with bacon, tomato, cheese, and mustard since i didn't want onions on mine. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/uqb9ks7lzesghltmuunmea?select=3fcshb9yqxmpuyvnn8fyxa) the bacon was nice and crispy but the <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> was tiny and wasn't anything special. the ones from costco are way bigger! \n\nmy bun was also flimsy and broke in half after 2 bites. it could have used much more chili and the cheese wasn't melted enough. it was still a tasty meal overall but totally not worth the price tag.", 
            "the <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> are quite expensive. i had a swiss/mushroom <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark>, i think the mushrooms came out of a can. the <mark>Swiss Cheese</mark> was cold was not even melted. the <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> itself was small, but it had that \"snap\" that i really like. the bun was alright.\n\nthe young asian lady that got our order was not friendly at all. she doesn't even smile...\"what's your problem, miss???\"\n\nbetter luck next time... pink's las vegas....very disappointing!", 
            "really, you want to charge me 7 dollards for a <mark>Chili</mark> <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark>?  one star for having pepsi on tap and unlimited refills and a cool place to people watch, but wow <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> literally cost 20 cents. what's up with the 3500% markup?\n\nand, it wasn't even noticeably better than wienerschnitzel's. disappointed and $7 more in the hole.", 
            "i am a lover of the weiner!... but, this place was all talk and no show.  i have to say that i enjoy the <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> ladies at usc, sac downtown, or tj over pinks...  yes. i'd much rather have some sacramento capitol dawg over pink's... and, (if you know me) that's saying alot...", 
            "i came to the strip to hang out with some friends i haven't seen in a while. since i live in la, i know pink's and introduced them to it and they love it. some of those friends have since moved away from la and are deprived of the pink's that they have come to love. well upon hearing that there was one in vegas, one of my friends was so happy because she was totally anticipating it and hyping it to her husband. \n\nwell we found it outside on the strip by p.f. chang's at the planet hollywood casino. there was no line. not a good sign, but we thought that the pink's name that we know and love in la would suffice so no worries. \n\nwe all ordered our dogs and sides of <mark>French Fries</mark> and chili <mark><mark><mark>Deluxe Chili Cheese Fries</mark></mark></mark>. the orders came back rather quickly and we proceeded out to the patio to sit and eat. \n\nso how was it? not very good. the toppings were cold and the <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> was limp and just didn't ooze of the flavor and kick that the la spot has. it's also more expensive here even without the wait. and one of my friends wanted a <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> she had in la, but they changed the names to fit the vegas theme and lacked the same kick in la. and the husband? he was less than impressed with the place. we ended up being belligerent and threw the fries at each other rather than eat it. \n\nall in all, disappointed with the experience in vegas. again, the nonexistent line should have been a clue. not impressed. they really have to overhaul the place to make it match la's! my friends and i gladly wait in line and are satisfied in la. here, not so much. disappointed to say the least.", 
            "let me just preface this by saying the only similarity this place has with the original pink's on melrose ave. in la is the name. overpriced, mediocre <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> (where's the beef?) made worse by forgettable service (people who work there look like they want to be anywhere but there). anyway, i would save my $7 and go somewhere else, the small <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> stand outside home depot on rainbow & charleston serves up way better <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> at 1/4 the price. ironic since this is how pink's started. i'm disappointed that pink's would even lend their brand to this poseur, it lacks the awesome hot-dogs, charm, nostalgia, location vantage and obviously the patrons swarming the original dinky shack.", 
            "definitely not the awesome experience that i had with the pink's <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> that i tried in la.  the place in planet hollywood is of course cleaner and newer.  but the <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> i ordered (with pastrami, <mark>Swiss Cheese</mark> and mustard) was nothing special.  what i thought was surprisingly good were their <mark>Onion Ring</mark>.\n\nmy friends that i went to eat with all had similar reactions. (one ordered the <mark>Plain Polish Sausage</mark>-based dog, which he said was overcooked and dried).\n\nmaybe it is new and they are still trying to get up to speed, but just under $8 for a <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark>! not including any beverage, that is totally not worth going back to try again, no matter how much i miss the pink's <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> from la.", 
            "not sure what all the pink's hype is about. my friends from la stand in line for an hour at the one out there (never been, just to the one in vegas i'm reviewing). basic <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark>. had better at ball parks (fenway!). it was a 10 minute line wait here, but i think that was more due to the incompetence of the staff behind the counter. glad i've been, cause i now i don't have to endure the wait in line in la (as in i wouldn't go out of my way to return to pinks anywhere).", 
            "been wanting to try the pink's in la for years, but somehow just never made it.  was tickled 'pink' to see that there was an outlet on the strip at the new planet hollywood.  carnegie deli and pinks in vegas?  heck, i won't have to travel as much now if i can have it all here. :)  after a fun night of drinking, i headed there and excitedly ordered the chili-dog.\n\nit was okay...didn't wow me, but was pretty much a regular chili-dog.  maybe i expected a little too much?  i mean how much can you expect from a <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark>?  even then, i expected something just a little more special.  the snap i had been expecting was nowhere to be found either, but perhaps the hot chili was a factor.\n\nthe outdoor seating and watching the crowds go by on the strip made it all the more entertaining.  bonus points for having seen jerry springer (for real) standing in the same spot just a few hours earlier.\n\nsadly, the chili-dog was so small that i ended up at sirocco's for a late night slice afterwards.  not a bad way to end a night at all.", 
            "for a <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> place, even in vegas, the prices are crazy. pretty decent chili-dog. the <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> had the right snap to it.  the chili was pretty good. \n\ni really hope that pink's in la is better than this, or it might be one of the most overrated places of all time.", 
            "i do feel the need to paint a little picture before writing this review... its monday morning, last day in vegas, ish needs too go down. bottle of gentlemen jack - killed by 1030am. 4 rounds of flip cup for shots donezo by noon. the day is now set for ultimate triumph or complete utter disaster. \n\nwalking down the strip, i had seen pinks the day before. i had no clue that pinks had expanded from la and was stoked! when we got in, i had to ask if it was the same and homeboy at the counter said \"yeah, its exactly the same but we just charge a lot more.\" i laughed and asked where he was from.... 408... gotta love the bay!! \n\ni ordered a las <mark>Vegas Strip Dog</mark>: 2 <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark>, chili, cheese, guac, onions, mustard, jalapeno. \na friend order some kind of bacon, cheese chili craziness dog. wow \nto top it all off, we split some <mark><mark><mark>Deluxe Chili Cheese Fries</mark></mark></mark>. \n\nok - i get that its really pricey for a <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> but i was so full that it didn't matter. when it comes down to it, 9 bucks isnt that bad if you end up satisfied it is?\n\nthe perfect end to an awesome weekend in lv.", 
            "holy crap! there is a pink's <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> in vegas! i honestly don't remember the name but i had a dog with bbq sauce and cole slaw. friggin awesome! my wife had a less inspired dog that had chili, onions, cheese, and mustard. twas still really good but not as good as mine. i really have no cons about it. friendly staff, good eats, simple set up, good price. bonus - shot walk from the bellagio water shows. so try to grab some pinks after 3pm.", 
            "during my thanksgiving vacation my first dinner in vegas is pink's <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark>. i was told the pink <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> is the most famous one in hollywood. since i never got a chance to visit the hollywood one, we decided to give it a try and see how their \"hollywood\" tastes.\n\nmy <mark>Planet Hollywood Dog</mark> comes with some bacon and melted cheese, along with the <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark>. it was not that bad but i did feel a little bit ripped off. i guess anyone who has bacon, american cheddar, <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> and bun could easily make a <mark>Planet Hollywood Dog</mark> at home with a much lower price. is it because it's on the strip and they need to pay for the rent and renovation (and advertising as well)? \n\ni would think even the costco <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> has more cost-performance value than pink's at las vegas. after visiting this store, i think i need to find out how the real socal, hollywood pink's <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> tastes, not the fake hollywood!\n\noh by the way - don't order their fries. very expensive and small portion.", 
            "pink's <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> is a good place to go eat just for the experience. i guess it is famous in la and just opened here, so with all the hype for this new location i decided to try it one day when i was at the miracle mile shops. when you walk in it is a small little stand, just like if it was to be its own independant trailer on a corner, all the seating is at tables outside facing the strip. they have a large menu posted on the wall as you walk in. i got the mushroom swiss <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark>, i think that is what it was. it was good, but didn't care for the mayonnaise they drizzle on as if it was mustard. the prices are a little high, i believe i spent xlose to 12 dollars on just a dog and a soda, but sitting outside is nice, i am a big fan of patio dining. all in all it was a cool experience to be a part of the famous pink's <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark>, but i couldn't see going there too often. definitely more for tourists than locals, but the strip in general gets old for locals so maybe i am just too biased.", 
            "i do not normally eat <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark>, but i love a good bratwurst or italian sausage.\n\nbetween the four of us we had four <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> and sausage dishes, plus a burger, the <mark>Onion Ring</mark>, and chili-fries.\n\nwe expected the <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> and sausages to be of great quality, but we found them to be lacking in flavor.     i would have given the restaurant 1 star, but bumped them up to two stars for the following:\n- the bacon on my planet hollywood was amazing (but everything else in it was blah)\n- the <mark>Onion Ring</mark> were very tasty (the chili-<mark><mark><mark>Deluxe Chili Cheese Fries</mark></mark></mark> on the other hand were not).\n- when they messed up our order, they quickly corrected it and additionally let us keep the sausage plate that we hadn't ordered.\n- my friends said that unlike <mark>The Showgirl Dog</mark>, the burger was actually quite tasty\n\nfor me, i think the sausages that one finds at an outdoor fair have much better taste/quality than what i found at pinks.   \n\ni recalled the meals being much better at the one in l.a......was that  because after waiting an hour in line in the cold in l.a. anything they served me would have tasted good?   i don't know, but i know i won't be returning to the vegas pink's.", 
            "had to see if this place lives up to par with the infamous pink's in la. i actually kind of missed the special celeb dogs from la.. this place only had 3-4 specials: the kim kardashian, holly madison, and 2 others that i can't remember at the moment because they are probably insignificant. i ended up getting a <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> with <mark>Plain Polish Sausage</mark> and chili which was good, but definitely not worth $7. but whatever, a meal is a meal. and i was fed and happy.", 
            "i had the chicago <mark>Polish <mark>Bacon Chili <mark>Polish <mark>Brooklyn Pastrami <mark>Swiss Cheese</mark> Dog</mark></mark></mark></mark> (figured i should counter all the grease and calories with the lettuce, tomato, and relish that comes on this dog), almost like a mini salad on top of my <mark>Plain Polish Sausage</mark>! it was ok except for the fact that my bun completely fell apart, thus defeating the purpose of eating a <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark>. my friend had the bacon <mark><mark><mark>Nacho Cheese</mark> <mark>Polish <mark>Bacon Chili <mark>Polish <mark>Brooklyn Pastrami <mark>Swiss Cheese</mark> Dog</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark>, which i had a bite of and really enjoyed. the bacon added just the right amount of salty goodness. the fries here were really tasty, and although we didn't order <mark>Onion Ring</mark>, almost every other table around us had them so i'm guessing they're popular. \n\nwhat is nice about this place is its location on the strip and the outdoor seating. a great place to people-watch and enjoy the weather. as a sun-starved seattleite, it was nice to be able to get some vitamin d and uv rays in since most of our vegas cavorting usually happens at night.\n\nif you want yummy <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> and fries, or just some hangover food that hits the spot, i'd recommend. if you're a tourist in vegas and are trying to experience pink's in the city of sin, this surely isn't it. too clean, too friendly, too flashy. <mark>The Showgirl Dog</mark> and dirtiness, and hour-long wait in line that you'll find at the original pink's in la is what makes it special, for better or for worse.", 
            "i go every time i go for a trek up and down the strip and will continue to do so.\n\nthe reason i'm only giving three stars is that although the service is good, and the place is clean, and <mark>The Showgirl Dog</mark> aren't bad, they're not all that great either.  mainly i like the place for the variety.\n\n<mark>The Showgirl Dog</mark> by itself can't hold up to a properly done nathans, but it's nowhere near as bad as a bar s.\n\nthe rueben dog is good, but the <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> itself gets lost in the reuben part, which isn't bad, but i'd like to taste <mark>The Showgirl Dog</mark> if it's there.\n\nnow, what makes pinks (la anyways) famous is the <mark><mark><mark><mark>Nacho Cheese</mark> <mark>Polish <mark>Bacon Chili <mark>Polish <mark>Brooklyn Pastrami <mark>Swiss Cheese</mark> Dog</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark>.  i recently had the bacon chili <mark><mark>Poli Bacon Burrito Dog</mark></mark>.  the bacon was nice if undercooked, but that's about it.  the cheese and onions got lost in the chili which was pretty dang boring.  it's not spicy, it's not flavourful.  it tastes kind of like bean powder was mixed with ground beef, gravy, and a dash of tabasco.  not anything special.\n\nif a place is famous for something, it should be good, that's why they're famous.  so it was very disappointing to discover it tastes like something out of a <mark>Bud</mark> can.", 
            "this pink's serves up tasty dogs for sure - but i suppose it's all about the toppings. i opted for the cheesy-grilled mush/onion-<mark>Bacon</mark> goodness of the <mark>Planet Hollywood Dog</mark> (i guess a new creation just for this las vegas location) which was exactly what i'd expect a polish piled with melted cheese, grilled stuff, and good bacon to taste like. \n\nmy only qualm is the outdoor-only seating where you see large hordes of asian families hovering around the deck heaters (perhaps this was simply a product of being here around christmastime), and the pricing - which is a little more than i'd expect out of a <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> (considering for the price i could have a pretty decent lunch at a many a sit-down restaurant).",

            "i should've checked yelp instead of listening to all the hype. while on vacation there were a few places my friends and i had heard about quite often and wanted to check out - pink's was one of them. located right in our hotel, we figured it'd be one of the better places to eat during our trip, but ... not so much.\n\nmaybe it's because i've been spoiled by all the good food here in san francisco, but pink's didn't strike me as anything special. most of the items seemed to be pretty similar, mostly consisting of chili, bacon, onions, cheese, and other meats; not a ton of variety overall. though i have to say, the portions-to-price ratio was pretty good - you get a gigantic, filling meal for about $10 or so, and unless you have a monstrous appetite you won't need a second <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark>.\n\nas for the food itself? average. even though most of my friends and i were feeling ravenous i think only one out of nine of us managed to finish, and it wasn't really because of how filling the <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> were. sure, they're packed to the brim with condiments and other things, but it's mostly standard fare. i actually felt kind of sick and bloated for a few hours afterward, and i certainly didn't feel like finishing the leftovers after looking at it later than day.\n\nunfortunately for people thinking they'll get to sit indoors and have a <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> in an ac-dominated environment, the only seating is outdoors in the hot, hot vegas sun, with only a few tables sitting underneath a bit of shade. it's a pretty small location, so if it's crowded you might just want to bring everything back to your room instead. it'll be less messy that way anyway.\n\noverall i don't think pink's met the hype at all. perhaps because the original is in los angeles and not in vegas, and in addition i've had better <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> at local joints (sorry!). it's probably worth a stop if you're in vegas, but don't go there expecting the best <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> you've ever had. you'll only set yourself up for disappointment in the end.",

            "first off, this is nothing like the pinks in la. i've been living in san diego for a year now, after having lived in la and i miss pinks. so when i was in vegas and saw pinks on the strip i got really excited. as soon as i walked in, i should have known. this place is everything pink and looks like a retro 50's diner. this caught me off guard considering the real pinks is basically a rundown bungalow covered in photographs and the only thing that's actually pink is the sign out front. next was the menu. i didn't recognize a single 'special <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark>'. the original pinks special <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> either have a la themed name or are named after a celebrity. the pinks in las vegas has special dogs named with a las vegas theme. so i had to ask the girl at the front counter if they knew which dogs were renamed and which dog was the martha stewart dog. she had a list behind the counter that listed which special <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> were renamed but she told me that most of their special dogs were not their own creations, not renamed dogs from the original location. uhhhh... ok. so basically this pinks is a completely different restaurant with the name pinks slapped on.\n\nnow for the food. i ordered a <mark><mark><mark>Nacho Cheese</mark> <mark>Polish <mark>Bacon Chili <mark>Polish <mark>Brooklyn Pastrami <mark>Swiss Cheese</mark> Dog</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark> (with a <mark>Plain Polish Sausage</mark> subbed for the <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark>) with mustard and a side of fries, totally $13 and some odd cents. i waited a few minutes and my order number was called. i went to retrieve my food and got really confused as soon as i saw the <mark>French Fries</mark> which are nothing like the la pinks <mark>French Fries</mark>. i made a comment to the person who gave me my food about it looking nothing like food from the original pinks, and a woman, also from la, walked up behind me and said the same. \n\nso was the food good? yeah, it was decent. but not worth the 13 bucks i spent on it. the shoe-string fries were nothing like the cajun fries (that the la pinks serves) i was expecting but the were good nonetheless. worth the $5.99 i paid for them? no. but that's what you get for eating on the strip. the <mark>Plain Polish Sausage</mark> was pretty good and the chili was... not so flavorful. but overall i'm glad i tried it.\n\nthe verdict: if you're on the strip near planet hollywood and craving <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark>, this is probably the best you'll find. however, if you're a lover of the original pinks and have your heart set on your usual order, don't come here. you'll leave with a craving that wasn't curbed, disappointed, and with a wallet that weighs less than when you walked in.",

            "i have long heard about pink's <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> being a go-to hot spot late at night for grub and the chance to run into celebrities out in hollywood but have never had the chance to go.  thus i was really excited when i saw that pink's had opened a storefront right on the strip in vegas.  \n\nafter a long night of debauchery, i walked halfway across the strip just so i could eat at pink's.  i have to give them credit, they sure know how to jazz up a <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark>.  i ordered a <mark>The Spicy Mojave Dog</mark>, which is a <mark>Plain Polish Sausage</mark> with <mark>Nacho Cheese</mark>, guacamole and jalape\\u00f1o peppers on it.  i ordered relish on it as well.  \n\nthe combination works well in theory as well as in practice.  but in practice all of that stuff on a <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> makes it damn near impossible to eat as you would normally.  picking it up makes all the toppings fall off, and a sloppy mess gets all over your hands.  so i had to resort to eating <mark>The Showgirl Dog</mark> with a fork and knife.  i felt pretty stupid, but it was the only way to do it and plenty of people around me were doing the same.  \n\nbut eating like that made the bun soggy, which is not good.  i appreciate the effort they put into dressing up a <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark>, but i only give it three stars because i've had amazing \"gourmet\" <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> in chicago before, with toppings piled high, but with which i could still eat as <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> are intended to be eaten - with your hands.",

            "i'm a big fan of pink's, being from the la area so i was happy to try out the one here in vegas.  i came here with my family and luckily we were able to take advantage of the groupon deal a couple of weeks before.  all 3 of us opted for the <mark>Chicago <mark>Polish <mark>Brooklyn Pastrami <mark>Swiss Cheese</mark> Dog</mark></mark></mark>, except i had it with a regular <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> instead of the <mark>Plain Polish Sausage</mark>.  <mark>The Showgirl Dog</mark> are loaded with toppings.  the casing around <mark>The Showgirl Dog</mark> has a nice snap when you bite into it and tastes just as good as the pink's in la.  the <mark>French Fries</mark> are shoestring fries which i happen to looove.  i'm not a fan of fat fries, so these were perfect and crispy.  i'm not sure if the make their <mark>Onion Ring</mark> but those are also fantastic, just the right amount of breading and cooked perfectly.  it was chilly out so i also ordered a <mark>Hot Chocolate</mark> only to find the gal behind the counted mixing up a pouch of the powdered stuff with water.... boo! oh well, the <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> were what we came for and they sure did hit the spot. \n\nalso, you can get a naked dog and add ketchup, mustard, onions, relish and pickles for no charge... yum!", 
            "went to my first pink's of any kind today. heading into the first bite, i definitely did have high expectations, mainly because i was hungry, and also because the prices looked pretty darn high, even after accounting for the recent groupon deal. however, keep in mind that this in in the heart of the las vegas strip, so really you'd almost expect it to be pricey. it's not fair to compare this to costco <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> on price.\n\nwhen i tried my friend's <mark><mark><mark>Nacho Cheese</mark> <mark>Polish <mark>Bacon Chili <mark>Polish <mark>Brooklyn Pastrami <mark>Swiss Cheese</mark> Dog</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark>, my eyes, taste <mark>Bud</mark>, and probably everything else just lit up. yeah, hunger is the best sauce or whatever, but every component of that dog - bun, sausage, chili, and <mark>Grilled Onion</mark> - was really delicious and made me wish that i had chosen it. instead, i had gone with the <mark>Planet Hollywood Dog</mark>, which was also quite tasty with bacon and some sort of enhanced 'shrooms. i also loved the <mark>Plain Polish Sausage</mark>, which is fatter than the normal wiener, and the <mark>Nacho Cheese</mark> went surprisingly well with the rest of the ingredients.\n\nwe also shared some deluxe chili <mark><mark><mark>Deluxe Chili Cheese Fries</mark></mark></mark>, which had a crapload of toppings on them. in hindsight, if i had known how loaded the <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> would be, i would've ordered normal fries for about half the price because my friend was pretty much evacuating his toppings onto the fries. oh well, live and learn.\n\nanyway, i've seen the other reviews, and i'm sure it doesn't match everything that people like about the original pink's - which i still hope to go to some day - but it's still good eating. not considering the price, the only problem i have is that i'd rather go to earl of sandwich, which is right next door and which i love to death, so i might not really see this place much at all in the future. oh well, it was yummy knowing you.", 
            "first off, this is nothing like the pinks in la. i've been living in san diego for a year now, after having lived in la and i miss pinks. so when i was in vegas and saw pinks on the strip i got really excited. as soon as i walked in, i should have known. this place is everything pink and looks like a retro 50's diner. this caught me off guard considering the real pinks is basically a rundown bungalow covered in photographs and the only thing that's actually pink is the sign out front. next was the menu. i didn't recognize a single 'special <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark>'. the original pinks special <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> either have a la themed name or are named after a celebrity. the pinks in las vegas has special dogs named with a las vegas theme. so i had to ask the girl at the front counter if they knew which dogs were renamed and which dog was the martha stewart dog. she had a list behind the counter that listed which special <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> were renamed but she told me that most of their special dogs were not their own creations, not renamed dogs from the original location. uhhhh... ok. so basically this pinks is a completely different restaurant with the name pinks slapped on.\n\nnow for the food. i ordered a <mark><mark><mark>Nacho Cheese</mark> <mark>Polish <mark>Bacon Chili <mark>Polish <mark>Brooklyn Pastrami <mark>Swiss Cheese</mark> Dog</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark> (with a <mark>Plain Polish Sausage</mark> subbed for the <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark>) with mustard and a side of fries, totally $13 and some odd cents. i waited a few minutes and my order number was called. i went to retrieve my food and got really confused as soon as i saw the <mark>French Fries</mark> which are nothing like the la pinks <mark>French Fries</mark>. i made a comment to the person who gave me my food about it looking nothing like food from the original pinks, and a woman, also from la, walked up behind me and said the same. \n\nso was the food good? yeah, it was decent. but not worth the 13 bucks i spent on it. the shoe-string fries were nothing like the cajun fries (that the la pinks serves) i was expecting but the were good nonetheless. worth the $5.99 i paid for them? no. but that's what you get for eating on the strip. the <mark>Plain Polish Sausage</mark> was pretty good and the chili was... not so flavorful. but overall i'm glad i tried it.\n\nthe verdict: if you're on the strip near planet hollywood and craving <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark>, this is probably the best you'll find. however, if you're a lover of the original pinks and have your heart set on your usual order, don't come here. you'll leave with a craving that wasn't curbed, disappointed, and with a wallet that weighs less than when you walked in.",

            "so here goes, i will say the one thing bad about this place has got to be the price. i guess with it being on the strip, one has to overlook that. but, i had gotten the <mark>Plain Polish Sausage</mark> with pastrami, swiss, onions and mustard. and they charge 7.79$!!! wow, thats a lot of money. now with that being said, <mark>The Showgirl Dog</mark> itself was good. the pastrami, wasn't juicy but it also wasn't dry. i usually like my pastrami, juicy, and a little bit of fat on the outside. the polish itself was the highlight. the first bite, it's juices ran down my lip and onto my jaw. great flavor and a great crunch. with that being said, i don't know if i am sold on it being an 8$ dog....plus tax of course.",

Turkey Dog</mark> has grown only stronger with age. i just see <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> and i'm hungry. i pass by vendors, and i have to stop. doesn't even matter if i've just eaten a three course meal and my jeans are unbuttoned. i will never pass up a <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark>. steamed, boiled, fried, or grilled.\n\nso imagine me, in vegas, a <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> place attached to the front of my hotel! how superfrikkinexciting. i'm all by my lonesome, just the way i like it, and i am starving!\n\npink's is where my tired feet carry me. i take my place in the ever growing line outside <mark>The Showgirl Dog</mark>. the smell is fantastic. i am like a little kid hopping from foot to foot, trying to look over me and determine my wait time.\n\nevidently, a few people ahead of me a woman is struggling with what kind of dog to order. c'mon, lady! i'm withering away here!\n\ni get close enough to check the menu and now have to decide between a regular dog with some mustard, or a specialty dog. the list is massive. how many ways can you tweak a <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark>. now i am seeing there are many! \n\ni order a specialty. hell, i am in vegas. go big or go home. a <mark><mark>Poli Bacon Burrito Dog</mark></mark>. fries. and a soda.\n\ni wait five minutes and whoot! number 80 is called. that's me! i sit down at the one table that's open, still dirty from the previous diner. i unwrap this massive thing, and take a huge bite. bleh!\n\nit felt like i was biting through a rubber dog drenched in chili. and through the rubber <mark>The Showgirl Dog</mark> wasn't very tasteful. if you've ever over-boiled a <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark>, you know the flavor i speak of. it's like cooking the flavor right out. i choked down half of it. after all, i was starving and needed to eat some of my money's worth. but half is all i got through. and i am a woman who can eat quite a few dogs in one sitting. the rest got tossed.\n\nlas vegas needs a few <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> vendors on the street.", 
            "no big deal is all i can really say. \n\npink's looked pretty busy and happening, and its menu sounded mouthwatering. its multiple \"celebrity\" endorsements and \"new\" <mark>Plain Veggie Dog (Soy) or 1/4 Lb. Turkey Dog</mark> sold me, and $7-something later i was settling down with a <mark>Plain Veggie Dog (Soy) or 1/4 Lb. Turkey Dog</mark> piled with swiss and sauerkraut. \n\nit was the perfect <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> - for a 5-year-old. i don't know what i was expecting but it certainly wasn't a rubbery boiled <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> stuck in a web of gooey melted processed swiss, sandwiched inside a cloudlike wonderbread style bun. it was all right, but completely lacking in sophistication. generous on the sauerkraut, though, i will give them that. \n\ni doubt i'll be revisiting pink's anytime soon - not with so many other options for quick bites crowding the strip and vying for my money.", 
            "i don't meat, but i still came here. really, i don't miss eating meat, but i do miss a good <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> + bun combo! so we came here, also because of the cheap prices. \n\nended up getting the only veggie option - <mark>Plain Veggie Dog (Soy) or 1/4 Lb. Turkey Dog</mark>. was cooked to order, but pretty good - got tomatoes, ketchup, mustard, lettuce for my toppings. only downside was that the bread was a bit too flimsy for my liking - when i eat a dog, i want some solid bread that can withstand any amount of toppings! costed about $6 or so. i'd like to know what it was made out of, actually... texture-wise, it was very <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark>.\n\nbummer that <mark>The Showgirl Dog</mark> don't come with a side... and i wasn't about to spend $4 just to have some <mark>Onion Ring</mark>. but a friend did get the <mark><mark><mark>Deluxe Chili Cheese Fries</mark></mark></mark>, which they described as covered with \"low grade meat\" but delicious \"once you're drunk enough.\" speaking of drunk - on the weekends they are open late - about 3 am or so - so a perfect place for the drunk munchies! \n\nwhat else? $20 for a bucket of 5 beers, you mix and match.", 
            "i never got to go to the one in la... but anyway, they have <mark>Plain Veggie Dog (Soy) or 1/4 Lb. Turkey Dog</mark>!  haha, the pink lemonade slushie was pretty good (a little too sweet though).  they  have a lot of toppings (my boyfriend got sausage with chili and i don't remember what else but it looked insane and insanely good) and they are famous in la... sorry, can't give too much insight because i kind of like <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> haha.  3.5!", 
            "since this place is also pinks <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark>, i believe i have the right to compare it to the original pinks in la, which would probably laugh at this place.\n\ni was so excited when i hear ph was opening a pinks <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark>. i was even more excited when i got to the place and saw that there was almost no line to wait in. in la i had to wait in line for over an hour just to get a delicious dog. however, i was very disappointed when i got to their menu.\n\nthis pinks is nothing compared to the la pinks. the selection pretty much sucks. i could make these <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> at home in my kitchen <mark>Plain Veggie Dog (Soy) or 1/4 Lb. Turkey Dog</mark> the street at 7-11 for a lot cheaper. just because everything is piled on high, doesn't mean it's any good. \n\nthere aren't even many side orders or any additional toppings from what i see on the menus. what kind of place is this!? you should be able to create your own monster or pick something incredible off of the menu, but you can't. even the fries are boring. you can get better fries at any mexican fast food joint. \n\nno wonder this place barely has a line whenever i pass by. the staff at the la pinks should come by and teach them a thing or two before this place goes out of business.", 
            "after working up an appetite wandering up and down the strip and in the planet hollywood shops, my friends and i decided pinks would be the perfect place to grab a quick lunch. coincidently, we also happened to each be wearing pink (not planned!) so it seemed even more fitting. \n\ni ordered the <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> with mushrooms and swiss. my friend ordered a <mark><mark><mark><mark>Nacho Cheese</mark> <mark>Polish <mark>Bacon Chili <mark>Polish <mark>Brooklyn Pastrami <mark>Swiss Cheese</mark> Dog</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark>, and another ordered the <mark>Plain Veggie Dog (Soy) or 1/4 Lb. Turkey Dog</mark>. we also ordered a side of fries and rings to share. \n\nfood came out quickly and i thought my dog was delicious. the fries were good but got cold quickly...most likely because it was cold outside where we were sitting, but still. the <mark>Onion Ring</mark> were ginormous and tasty. \n\nlunch came out to a bit under $10 per person which i don't think is bad. i would come back.", 
            "pink's was one of the cheapest meals we had in vegas! $26 for three people was a nice change of pace from spending triple & quadruple that at other eateries. \n\nthis was my first time eating at this vegas location but i'd been to the original so cal one a few times. i ordered my usual: a veggie <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> covered in chili cheese & onions. completely messy & totally heavy in the stomach; exactly what junk food should be. my companions ordered <mark>Polish <mark>Bacon Chili <mark>Polish <mark>Brooklyn Pastrami <mark>Swiss Cheese</mark> Dog</mark></mark></mark></mark>. \n\neven though i don't eat meat <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark>, i like that i don't have to be excluded from dining at pink's with people who do because they serve <mark>Plain Veggie Dog (Soy) or 1/4 Lb. Turkey Dog</mark>. brownie points for that. pink's food is kind of 'eh' but it's fun to eat outside, under heating lamps & surrounded by lights on the strip.", 
            "well it was a 105 out and the nice cool misting fans were looking nice. \nthe wait was to at the mall restaurants so we ended up here! i really do enjoy a good <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> when they can be found and the last couple i have had were very average. also seeing this on food network a few time made for some big expectations. \n\ni was excited to try pink's and the line was moving fast. i normally just go with a normal dog with ketchup when trying new places but the <mark><mark>Poli Bacon Burrito Dog</mark></mark> was sounding good and it sounded big! \n\nwe got our order pretty fast and the serve pepsi bleh, so went with sierra mist when in this situation. \n\nthen i went for the ketchup and then ooooo no cisco ketchup, blehhh, how could you pink's? i don't think i've had to have cisco ketchup since i was at the last country fair. that would be my only complaint here. ketshup is one of the only condiments i enjoy and if i'm eating a top quality <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> and fries, i need the good stuff! \n\nalas, my giant burrito filled with bacon, chili, cheese and 2 <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> was really to be devoured and it was. it was great, filling, and had some hearty chili which is something you either like <mark>Plain Veggie Dog (Soy) or 1/4 Lb. Turkey Dog</mark>'t, but i did. \n\ni was pretty full after that and i would have this again for sure. \n\nif i had coke, some heinz, and a cooled indoor seat, you could have had that 1 extra star!", 
            "pink's is okay.  i like that they have the option to sub a <mark>Plain Veggie Dog (Soy) or 1/4 Lb. Turkey Dog</mark>.  i do not, however, enjoy the chewy casing on the <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark>.  it's hard to bite through and kinda... rubbery.  overall, i eat here sometimes because it's (usually) pretty quick and easy.  i wouldn't necessarily go out of my way, though.", 
            "in my experience, finding a decent <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> when you don't eat red meat or pork is pretty tough.  i had all but given up on the idea of enjoying a sloppy dog... that is, until i went to pink's.  \n\ni had friends in town who were massively hungover, so they chose pink's <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> as their pick-me-up spot.  i usually just order a side dish (hello, fried food) at this type of joint, but then something caught my eye.  a quarter-pound turkey <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark>??  could it be???\n\ni took the chance, and ordered the <mark>Plain Veggie Dog (Soy) or 1/4 Lb. Turkey Dog</mark> with a simple dressing of ketchup and relish.  i keep it classic.  and what they served looked more like a kielbasa or bratwurst, it was so big.  thick, juicy, and great flavor.  success!  \n\nlong story longer, i will definitely be visiting pink's again.  great location, great atmosphere (outside seating), and great food.  the <mark>Onion Ring</mark> and <mark><mark><mark>Deluxe Chili Cheese Fries</mark></mark></mark> rocked as well.  bravo, pink's!", 
            "this bad review is my fault.  i am a terrible person, but i came here and ordered a <mark>Plain Veggie Dog (Soy) or 1/4 Lb. Turkey Dog</mark> with gauc.  before i lose 100% credibility as a meat eater, i have to say that i had been in vegas for days already eating nothing but greasy greasy food...burgers fries and alcohol.  i don't think i had pooped since i got to vegas...i'm serious, and the thought of trying a delicious <mark><mark><mark>Nacho Cheese</mark> <mark>Polish <mark>Bacon Chili <mark>Polish <mark>Brooklyn Pastrami <mark>Swiss Cheese</mark> Dog</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark> would probably make me puke.\n\nit i were to go right now, i would have gotten the biggest meatiest delicious thing there.  but i have to review my guac <mark>Plain Veggie Dog (Soy) or 1/4 Lb. Turkey Dog</mark>.\n\ni've eaten a fair share of <mark>Veggie Burger (Vegan)</mark> and dogs, so that being said it wasn't bad.  my issue was that the consistency was off, not super off like terrible, but i've had better.  the guac was not that good.  it wasn't like chipotle or home made, but it was some like green spread that was thin and kind of looked like bird shit honestly.  taste wise, it wasn't bad though.  i ate it and stole pastrami off my boyfriends for more flavor.  so, if you're in vegas feeling as i was, try to get a salad with bacon instead of a <mark>Plain Veggie Dog (Soy) or 1/4 Lb. Turkey Dog</mark> at pinks.", 
            "tried to eat at g<mark>Plain Veggie Dog (Soy) or 1/4 Lb. Turkey Dog</mark> ramsay burgr, but there was an hour and a half wait.  pinks was right around the corner, so we decided to get a quick lunch.  i was with 5 other people. \n\ni ordered the polish bacon burrito.  the <mark>Plain Polish Sausage</mark> was okay, the skin was tough.  i liked the bacon and the chili, but it was very, very, very greasy.  my tortilla was soaked and dripping with grease, it was disgusting.  the others that i was with ordered <mark>Bacon Chili <mark>Polish <mark>Brooklyn Pastrami <mark>Swiss Cheese</mark> Dog</mark></mark></mark>, no tortilla, still really greasy.  the <mark>Pastrami Reuben Dog</mark> that was ordered looked good.  the regular <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> didnt really have all that much flavor, it was nothing special.  the fries were thin cut and crispy. \n\ni probably won't be back, nothing really special or different about <mark>The Showgirl Dog</mark>.", 
            "my mom and i both enjoyed it. we each ordered a <mark>Plain Veggie Dog (Soy) or 1/4 Lb. Turkey Dog</mark> and split a fry and <mark>Onion Ring</mark>. it was pretty good. we got to sit outside, eat, and people watch. we are not big fans of <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> of any type so we probably won't be back. but we're glad we tried it.", 
            "wow what a let down. for a day of fun, as las vegas locals, we valet'd at paris and walked over to pink's - there was no line and nobody eating at all. i ordered a <mark>Plain Veggie Dog (Soy) or 1/4 Lb. Turkey Dog</mark> (maybe that was my mistake) and <mark><mark><mark>Deluxe Chili Cheese Fries</mark></mark></mark>. the fries were the best part of the meal - i hate, i mean i hate gray, boiled looking <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> -- gosh i wish it was grilled i guess i should've asked but being from l.a. this place is suppose to be the best so i figured i'd leave it all in their hands....it was a let down and i won't be going back.",

            "i stopped here for a quick snack while i was in vegas.  i'm vegan and supposedly their <mark>Plain Veggie Dog (Soy) or 1/4 Lb.

Turkey Dog</mark> with ketchup, mustard and relish.  my dog plus a bottle of water was $9.00.  logical price for a snack on the strip!\n\nthe <mark>Plain Veggie Dog (Soy) or 1/4 Lb.

Turkey Dog</mark> either!  \n\ni have walked past here when the line is insane, so just keep that in mind if you plan on going.  no indoor seating, only outdoor patio with table umbrellas for shade.  it was about 90 degrees the day i went, but i was still comfortable with the shade.",

            "you wouldn't believe how difficult it is to locate a <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> restaurant on the vegas strip that carries vegetarian <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark>. we went to three different places on our hunt and were unable to find any place that carried such a thing. i get it, most veggie wieners are pretty bland and \"adequate\" would be a stretch for quality, but most of us who eat them know this and have found ways to make them appealing. when you don't carry any vegetarian options for <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark>, you lose out on our business, plus any business that might come with those non-vegetarians that are with us!\n\nfortunately after an hour of searching, we stopped in at pink's and they had a <mark>Plain Veggie Dog (Soy) or 1/4 Lb. Turkey Dog</mark> listed on their menu!  yay!  i ordered one, dressed as a <mark>Chicago <mark>Polish <mark>Brooklyn Pastrami <mark>Swiss Cheese</mark> Dog</mark></mark></mark> and my partner ordered a beef <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> with minimal toppings. we skipped out on fries as we just wanted a light snack, but we did each get a drink (beer and cider in cans). \n\nwe sat outside in the awesome weather and dug in. my <mark>Plain Veggie Dog (Soy) or 1/4 Lb. Turkey Dog</mark> was covered in amazing toppings and was delicious. i had to get a fork to clean up the bits that dropped out, i didn't want to leave anything behind. my partner enjoyed his meal as well, and we were able to leave knowing that we both got exactly what we wanted.\n\nthanks for carrying a <mark>Plain Veggie Dog (Soy) or 1/4 Lb.

            "for lunch i wanted to try pink's--finally.  i heard that their <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> were very good and decided to try for myself.  there are a few things to keep in mind when it comes to pink's--size and cost. i'll explain in a minute.\n\njust to let everyone know, pink's it outside of planet hollywood/miracle mile shops facing the boulevard.  i walked around for awhile till i found the sign in the building and realized it was outside.  anyway, there wasn't a line and their seating is all outside, so i went in to take a look at their menu.\n\nthe menu is simple with pre-made options for you and even burgers if you aren't into their dogs. at almost 10 dollars a dog it was pretty pricey, but i expected that from a famous <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> eaterie.  they even have their special dogs from celebrities on a flyer at the entrance and near the menu, so check those out, too.\n\ni went for a <mark>Guadalajara Dog</mark>--<mark>Sour Cream</mark>, tomatoes, onions and relish--and my husband ate their classic <mark><mark><mark><mark>Nacho Cheese</mark> <mark>Polish <mark>Bacon Chili <mark>Polish <mark>Brooklyn Pastrami <mark>Swiss Cheese</mark> Dog</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark> with onions.  we grabbed a water and fountain drink for a total of 25 dollars and moved on down to the pick up area. when i saw our <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> i freaked out.  i love toppings, but really?  really?  this was definitely a fork and knife dog.\n\ni love eating my <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> by hand.  it's just the way that it should be, but at pink's it's difficult to do so.  too many toppings on <mark>The Showgirl Dog</mark> cause the flavor of <mark>The Showgirl Dog</mark> to be lost, so i scraped everything off on one half to get down to what matters--that fried dog.  the <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> is good with a slight snap to it, but it's not an amazing.  i ate the rest with my utensils, feeling as if i violated some ethical <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> code by not eating with my hands.\n\nif you want to try <mark>The Showgirl Dog</mark>, buy a plain one and ask for toppings on the side if you need them, that way you can really taste what a pink's dog is all about.  if you want something really good, their <mark><mark><mark><mark>Nacho Cheese</mark> <mark>Polish <mark>Bacon Chili <mark>Polish <mark>Brooklyn Pastrami <mark>Swiss Cheese</mark> Dog</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark> was decent.\n\noverall <mark>The Showgirl Dog</mark> was decent and i can at least say that i've tried it once. would i fight my way down there through traffic again for it?  nope.  but it's something you have to try once so you can say that you have.",

            "oh pink's, how you have been able to somewhat redeem yourself. going to college in los angeles, you're bound to go to pink's at least once. after having it there, i really thought this place was overrated. the <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> were just ok, and were definitely not worth the wait in line (at least 30 minutes).\n\nbecause of that, i really did not want to give this location a chance. however, we were leaving las vegas and wanted something were it would've be relatively quick. hesitantly, i agreed to go to pink's. and you know what, i'm really glad i did.\n\nfor those that do not know where pink's is, it's outside on the strip. when we got here, i was honestly surprised that there was no line here. i had to initially do a double take to make sure i was at the right location. there were the familiar pictures of celebrities on the wall which helped me know that i was at the right place.\n\ndue to being hungry, i ordered <mark>The Spicy Mojave Dog</mark> and the <mark>Guadalajara Dog</mark>. the <mark>Guadalajara Dog</mark> was good, the mix of <mark>Sour Cream</mark>, tomatoes, and relish was a nice combination with the <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark>. i'm not the biggest fan of relish, but i liked it in this case. <mark>The Spicy Mojave Dog</mark> was pretty awesome. to warn you in advance, make sure you have napkins, a fork, and a knife. i rarely eat <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> with a knife and fork, but in this case, you must! the <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> have a nice pop when you take a bite, which i love in a <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark>.\n\nthere's no room to eat inside, but there are tables outside for you to sit and enjoy the strip on a nice warm day. especially after a big night of partying, this is a nice way to recover. \n\noverall, i'd give it 3.5 stars. the reason i rounded it down to a 3 was due to my experiences at the hollywood location. though i'll definitely would come back to this location whenever i'm in vegas.",

            "i had never been to pink's before, but had a groupon that was running out, and so we ventured out for dinner on a late thursday night to beat the deadline.  no problem, right?  by all appearances, it was just an unremarkable thursday night.  \n\nso off to planet hollywood we went.  but when we pulled up to valet parking behind three stretch limos, and no valet was in sight, something seemed off.  then i saw that we were about six blocks from the valet stand, again with no valet in view.  so, off to self-parking we went, with uniformed police everywhere, to find a parking spot.  at length we found one--the only one.  something unusual was definitely going on.\n\nso, diane and i walked from the parking garage into the miracle mile shops, and walked and walked.  as we finally reached the entrance to planet hollywood on the other side of the shopping promenade, 9 uniformed sheriff's deputies were assembled together, and fashionably suited males and well-dressed females were everywhere.  about then i realized that we had left the groupon in the car.  oh, well (sigh).  i decided that i wasn't going to walk all the way back and return again just to save a mere $5!  so, we continued on and out the main doors until we finally saw pink's facing las vegas boulevard, and examined the vast menu on the wall before making our selections.\n\nthis story does end well.  i really enjoyed my brooklyn pastrami swiss <mark><mark><mark>Nacho Cheese</mark> <mark>Polish <mark>Bacon Chili <mark>Polish <mark>Brooklyn Pastrami <mark>Swiss Cheese</mark> Dog</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark> with pickles, onions, mustard, and sauerkraut added, on a soft old country bun.  it included a generous amount of tender pastrami, and although the <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> was thin, it was long and had a very nice snap to it when one bit into the casing.  beer-battered <mark>Onion Ring</mark> and nicely salted shoestring fries were both good and tasty.  and i liked the mild <mark>Nacho Cheese</mark> sauce for dipping my fries, while diane enjoyed <mark>Mini Corn Dogs</mark>.  to my surprise, one single <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> sufficed to quell my appetite.  and, there were free refills of lemonade and all other available soft drinks.  \n\nthe place is nothing fancy, seating is all outside, and there is only counter service.  but staff members were friendly and helpful.  we had a nice view of the strip before us, but it was a mite cold and windy at 10:47 p.m.  heat lamps were present, but not in service.  hard driving music overhead added to the casual ambiance.  so, we finished our food, walked all the way back to the car, and left the parking lot as we were directed out by at least 6 police officers.  just as we were turning onto tropicana avenue, diane asked the last officer if she knew what was going on at planet hollywood, and was told, \"soul train awards!\"\n\nnow i'm sort of glad that i still have my groupon for pink's, which, as luck would have it, does not really expire for another month.  for, it means that i can return again soon to enjoy another tasty classic dog!",

            "i went here twice while i was in vegas. don't trust my review though, since i wasn't exactly sober lol.\n\nthe first night, i went for the <mark><mark><mark>Nacho Cheese</mark> <mark>Polish <mark>Bacon Chili <mark>Polish <mark>Brooklyn Pastrami <mark>Swiss Cheese</mark> Dog</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark>. from what i can remember, it was freaking amazing. my best friend told me i scarfed it down.\n\nthe second day, i went for the <mark>Mushroom Swiss Dog</mark> (i forgot the exact name). it was just a-ok.\n\ndefinitely going back when i go back to vegas though :)", 
            "we were looking for something fast so we decided to stop here thinking it would be a quick and cheap stop. i know they have more of these in california and i heard they're pretty popular but after eating here, i cannot find a single reason why.\n\ni don't really like <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> (which maybe discredits my review) but my two other friends got <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> and nobody enjoyed their food. i got a cheeseburger which are usually hard to mess up. it wasn't burnt or anything but there was absolutely no flavor and the tomatoes were diced and the lettuce shredded. i get that shredded premade veggies may be easier but who puts diced tomatoes on a burger? it made it really messy to eat. and at almost 9 bucks for a standard burger (with no fries or drink) i expected a little more. my friends <mark>Mushroom Swiss Dog</mark> had mushrooms that tasted old and my other friend got the bacon <mark><mark><mark><mark>Nacho Cheese</mark> <mark>Polish <mark>Bacon Chili <mark>Polish <mark>Brooklyn Pastrami <mark>Swiss Cheese</mark> Dog</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark>. we all got halfway through and looked at each other with dissatisfied faces and tossed the rest. sadly, i think you'd be better off at a mcdonalds.\n\noh and to top it off some blaring alarm was going off the whole time and no one seemed to mind it or address to their customers that everything was fine or that it would be turned off shortly. i think it was the fire alarm, idk lights were flashing and a siren going. i understand that it may have been out of their control, but i think good customer service would have acknowledged it and let the customer know the roof wasn't going to fall in or something like that."

            "i discovered this place on my friend's instagram, but i thought that i'd never try it because a norcal girl like me wouldn't be in socal too often. however, to my luck, it was fate that my vegas trip brought me here to dine with my girlfriends for a bite. we ordered the <mark>Planet Hollywood Dog</mark>, the las <mark>Vegas Strip Dog</mark>, and <mark><mark><mark>Deluxe Chili Cheese Fries</mark></mark></mark>.\n\nthe <mark><mark><mark>Deluxe Chili Cheese Fries</mark></mark></mark> were super crispy and fresh, and definitely one of the best fries i've ever tasted. they were gone instantly among the four of us. i split the las <mark>Vegas Strip Dog</mark> with my friend since it had two dogs inside of it, and i never thought i'd be eating guacamole on a <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> until that day. it was delicious! i have no other words to describe it, but both guacamole and chili were great additions to my <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark>. i haven't tried the <mark>Planet Hollywood Dog</mark>, but my friends gushed about how great it tasted.\n\nthe prices may be expensive for something like a <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark>, but you're paying for the presentation and quality of the <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> combinations, which are all pretty amazing.", 
            "finally got to try this place.\n\nverdict: <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> were as plain as you can get, tasted just like a plain ol' nathan's <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark>. i got the <mark>Vegas Strip Dog</mark> which had two <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> in one bun + mustard + ketchup + chili + cheese + guacamole + jalape\\u00f1os. basically they serve a <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> with various junk you can add on top. \n\nthe fries were really good though. perfect level of crispiness on the outside and fluffiness on the inside.\n\none other downside is that this place only has an outdoor patio for seating.", 
            "omg so this place is better than words can even describe! i know i had no business ending up here last weekend but i'm sure glad i did! i've always wanted to try this place out! after a long night of having fun and gambling a group of my friends stumbled across this place! sometimes there are certain foods that taste even better when your drunk and this place happens to be one if them! i ordered the vegas style <mark>Vegas Strip Dog</mark> and added <mark>Sour Cream</mark>! a bit messy and kind of expensive for a <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> meal but it was worth every penny spent :-) the fact that they offer a huge variety of <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> styles means i will be returning until i've tried all the ones i'd like to try!",

            "this place is pretty good, nothing too amazing though. it's more expensive than the la pink's and not as tasty, but i expected as much eating in vegas. ordered a <mark>Vegas Strip Dog</mark> (2 dogs, jalpenos, cheese, onions) which came out pretty quickly with chili <mark><mark><mark>Deluxe Chili Cheese Fries</mark></mark></mark>. it's a lot of food though. an order of chili <mark><mark><mark>Deluxe Chili Cheese Fries</mark></mark></mark> is enough to feed one or even two people. seating is outside and with the wind it's a bit annoying but you get to see all the weirdos down the street and sometimes cool performers.", 
            "i've had many opportunities to go to the pink's in la, but i just can't stand waiting in lines for things. oh please let me patronize your business. i'll do anything! i'll wait for an hour for the right to hand you money in exchange for food! those kind of places just seem obscene to me, like they are disrespecting the customers valuable time just to seem more popular. the long lines places want to have that hip vibe like they just can't keep up with the demand, but realistically they could have hire more people or expand. but they choose not to because they want the long lines.\n\nbut the location in <mark>Vegas Strip Dog</mark>'t have that kind of jackassery and i could just try their food without the surrounding crap. it was quite good! very creative toppings. good portions for the money. <mark>The Showgirl Dog</mark> itself had a proper snap and was juicy.\n\ni want to give it more than 3 stars, but 4 stars is entering fine dining territory. i'm surprised that after all these years yelp has not done half star system yet to be more precise in the ratings. 3.5 stars would be the actual proper rating for this. it's worth a trip!", 
            "i'd have to say that my experience here was neither good or bad. there were many different style <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> on the menu to choose from. the cashier was super friendly and inviting. we ordered a mushroom <mark>Polish <mark>Brooklyn Pastrami <mark>Swiss Cheese</mark> Dog</mark></mark> and a <mark>Vegas Strip Dog</mark>, both of which were under $8 each. the <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> i have to say in my opinion were bland. i don't think the flavors were anything exciting or memorable. i was most disappointed with my mushroom <mark>Polish <mark>Brooklyn Pastrami <mark>Swiss Cheese</mark> Dog</mark></mark> because i felt the mushrooms were too rubbery and flavorless. however, it was nice to sit outside with the water mist to cool us down.", 
            "this was another cheap place to have lunch and it was close to the hotel (planet hollywood) which we where staying at while in vegas. they had a number interesting <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark>. we decided to get the <mark>Vegas Strip Dog</mark> which was awesome and the and the ruben dog which was really good and a order of <mark>Onion Ring</mark> which you can't go wrong with. this place was a nice little find and the service was fast. \n\nseating was restricted to outside only which was ok they did have the heat warmers which made it better the only down fall was there was a lot of birds that where always around but they weren't to bad. it was a nice place to have a quick cheap lunch and just enjoy some people watching. i really don't think you could find a bad dog on the menu as it was a pretty large menu! i will definitely be back!"

            "decent. if you've been to the original la location, prepare to be somewhat disappointed. \n\nfood: meh. <mark>The Showgirl Dog</mark> seemed precooked, the buns were plain, and the mushrooms looked canned. the <mark>Planet Hollywood Dog</mark> was damn near $8 alone. i had to ask for a side of <mark>Nacho Cheese</mark>, because the ph dog here only comes with a slice of what looked like kraft cheese. the prices were at least $2 more than the la location, but i guess its understandable since its las vegas. the fries weren't freshly prepared like the la location either. and to top it off, they didn't have grape crush soda or yoo-hoo like the la location. \n\nservice: the cashier chicks were nice. <mark>The Showgirl Dog</mark> and sides were served up/made in assembly line unlike the personal attention you get from one person at the la location. \n\noverall, it was just meh. i'd rather drive 4 hours, then wait in line for another hour to have an authentic pink's <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark>. i probably won't come back here unless they somehow manage to replicate everything that the la location offers. this place seemed like the \"mcdonalds\" version of pink's. the only good thing is that they accept credit cards, while the la location is only accepts cash.", 
            "way overpriced for some tiny dogs, but they're pretty good. i haven't eaten the one in los angeles yet, so i need to give that a try. once i go to la, i will definitely update this review. \n\ngetting it to go is such a mess!! we had no choice but to and the huge stack of napkins totally helped. the <mark><mark><mark><mark>Nacho Cheese</mark> <mark>Polish <mark>Bacon Chili <mark>Polish <mark>Brooklyn Pastrami <mark>Swiss Cheese</mark> Dog</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark> basically exploded in the bag and it was messy for sure.\n\ncome to pinks for <mark>The Showgirl Dog</mark>, not the fries or <mark>Onion Ring</mark>. they are soo greasy that i felt like a tub of lard eating just one ring!",

            "went to pink's on the weekend of oct 2nd.  after drinking on an empty stomach, my two friends and i decided to go to pink's before meeting up with the rest of our friends at a club.  i'm not sure what it is about my group of friends but we like to have a few drinks before an intermission of (greasy but quick) food.  this can either be good or bad when it comes to writing reviews.  \n\nwe were starving and needed food asap.  we actually took a cab to ph for the sole purpose of getting pink's (instead of just eating something in the vicinity of our first spot or the next drinking spot) because after 2 nights of eating at expensive restaurants, clubs, and losing money at the tables - we wanted to eat something noteworthy but cheap.  \n\naccording to my friend who is born/raised socal, it is not as good as the original in cali.  i figured this was a mind-over-matter slash original-is-always-better-duhhh situation.  we ordered the bacon <mark><mark><mark>Nacho Cheese</mark> <mark>Polish <mark>Bacon Chili <mark>Polish <mark>Brooklyn Pastrami <mark>Swiss Cheese</mark> Dog</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark>, fries, and beer.   my other friend (a newyorker) and i thought it was good but agreed it wasn't awesome.  considering the acclamation pink's receives from born and bred la-ers, i changed my assumption and decided it probably is better at the original stand in la.  i remember thinking it wasn't as amazing of an experience as i was hoping to get - and was a bit disappointed by the lack of \"snap\" in <mark>The Showgirl Dog</mark> itself.  also, it was a bit... much.  i have a feeling <mark>The Showgirl Dog</mark> had better snap to it before it got doused in the chili.   \n\nthat being said, i did enjoy my experience there.  it was exactly what i was looking for at that moment.  we were buzzed and looking to eat something extremely unhealthy but tasty - and that's exactly what we got.\n\ni'd definitely try it again because for some reason, i think it was just an off night.  and we had some strange concoction of drinks before going there so all of this might be completely in my head.", 
            "wanted to try pink's in hollywood, but the line was crazy long.  was surprised to see it on the strip in vegas, i gave it a try.  <mark>The Showgirl Dog</mark> was really good and tasty with lots of toppings.  the only thing is the price, but it's just like going to the baseball or football game and buying a dog there.  i had the chicago this time.  i'll try something else next time.", 
            "i do not normally eat <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark>, but i love a good bratwurst or italian sausage.\n\nbetween the four of us we had four <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> and sausage dishes, plus a burger, the <mark>Onion Ring</mark>, and chili-fries.\n\nwe expected the <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> and sausages to be of great quality, but we found them to be lacking in flavor.     i would have given the restaurant 1 star, but bumped them up to two stars for the following:\n- the bacon on my planet hollywood was amazing (but everything else in it was blah)\n- the <mark>Onion Ring</mark> were very tasty (the chili-<mark><mark><mark>Deluxe Chili Cheese Fries</mark></mark></mark> on the other hand were not).\n- when they messed up our order, they quickly corrected it and additionally let us keep the sausage plate that we hadn't ordered.\n- my friends said that unlike <mark>The Showgirl Dog</mark>, the burger was actually quite tasty\n\nfor me, i think the sausages that one finds at an outdoor fair have much better taste/quality than what i found at pinks.   \n\ni recalled the meals being much better at the one in l.a......was that  because after waiting an hour in line in the cold in l.a. anything they served me would have tasted good?   i don't know, but i know i won't be returning to the vegas pink's.",

            "i go every time i go for a trek up and down the strip and will continue to do so.\n\nthe reason i'm only giving three stars is that although the service is good, and the place is clean, and <mark>The Showgirl Dog</mark> aren't bad, they're not all that great either.  mainly i like the place for the variety.\n\n<mark>The Showgirl Dog</mark> by itself can't hold up to a properly done nathans, but it's nowhere near as bad as a bar s.\n\nthe rueben dog is good, but the <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> itself gets lost in the reuben part, which isn't bad, but i'd like to taste <mark>The Showgirl Dog</mark> if it's there.\n\nnow, what makes pinks (la anyways) famous is the <mark><mark><mark><mark>Nacho Cheese</mark> <mark>Polish <mark>Bacon Chili <mark>Polish <mark>Brooklyn Pastrami <mark>Swiss Cheese</mark> Dog</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark>.  i recently had the bacon chili <mark><mark>Poli Bacon Burrito Dog</mark></mark>.  the bacon was nice if undercooked, but that's about it.  the cheese and onions got lost in the chili which was pretty dang boring.  it's not spicy, it's not flavourful.  it tastes kind of like bean powder was mixed with ground beef, gravy, and a dash of tabasco.  not anything special.\n\nif a place is famous for something, it should be good, that's why they're famous.  so it was very disappointing to discover it tastes like something out of a <mark>Bud</mark> can.", 
            "good and one of the few places on the strip where you can get full or under $10. i'm not a fan of the snap/almost crunch of <mark>The Showgirl Dog</mark>, but the toppings are plentiful and the prices are reasonable for vegas. i went mid afternoon and waited 5 minutes, i'm a pretty big guy and ordered two dogs...mistake! one is plenty, like i said not my favorite type of dog, but what they do they do well, i'll probably be back.",

            "dude, it's pink's...in vegas. my two favorite things in the world. ok, i really don't feel that way. but if i was a surfer dude from redondo beach out with my <mark>Bud</mark> for a vegas weekend, this would certainly be my dining destination of choice. since i'm not, i guess i can be a little more discriminating. but dude, it's pink's. well not quite pink's. just a reasonable facsimile in an apt setting, planet hollywood. \n\njamie w. and i really wanted some dogs after strolling through the sterile city center complex which has none of the kitsch that really is vegas. luckily, pink's has kitsch to spare in its patio setting outside the hotel entrance. the menu looked familiar. we decided to each get a $4.75 giant 12-inch jalapeno dog with <mark>Nacho Cheese</mark> and chili, and share a $6.50 \"planet hollywood\" dog, which consisted of a <mark>Plain Polish Sausage</mark>, <mark>Grilled Onion</mark>, <mark>Grilled Mushroom</mark>, bacon and cheese (see photos). oh did i mention the fries, too? nice and tasty they were. \n\nindigestion thy name is pink's. the jalapeno dog has that snap to the wiener that i don't care for much. i prefer a meatier dog to the tooth, and the mustard was way overwhelming, but chili, cheese and diced onions are bulletproof on a dog as far as i'm concerned. the \"planet hollywood\" dog has quite a pile of toppings to maneuver in your mouth starting with the bacon strips lording over the sausage already drowning in melted cheese. the mushrooms seemed almost incidental to the creation, but they were good. hell, it was all good in a bad, bad way. \n\nfood - 3 stars....quite an abundance of toppings on those dogs but not quite the pink's i remember in la \nambiance - 2 stars...hell, it's just a patio...in pink \nservice - 2.5 stars...just keep moving the line and <mark>The Showgirl Dog</mark> will eventually be there \ntotal - 3 stars...a middling experience based on a distant memory of the pink's in la",

            "so me and my girlfriend planned a vegas birthday trip with a group of our friends for the weekend back in january. at this time, city center had just barely opened and we were staying at aria in the sky suites. the sky suites at aria blew me away and they are amazing!!! but that's for another review... anyway, that morning we arrived, we decided to leave our comfy suite at aria and to take a stroll down the strip. being that it's january and still winter, i was stupid and brought a thin-ass jacket to wear and of course it did nothing to keep me warm. \n\nas we walk across the street from city center into planet hollywood, we see some people walking into pink's <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark>. and since we were all freezing in the cold and hungry, we decided to rush to <mark>The Showgirl Dog</mark> and order up some <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark>!\n\nlet me make something clear: we're la folk and we love heading down la brea ave in la to have a pink's <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> late at night after leaving the clubs. so you can imagine my excitement as we stepped in through <mark>The Showgirl Dog</mark> and out of the cold. i was gearing up to order myself a \"martha stewart\" dog but sadly, they don't offer it at this location. ok, not a big deal. i'll order whatever is on the menu. i think i had the holly madison... insert sad face. to make a long story short, this did not please me. \n\ni don't care what condiments and sides came with that damn <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark>, when i bit into that thing, i wanted to spit it right out. i know what a pink's <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> tastes like and that was not a pink's <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark>. it was soft and mushy and didn't have that firm, juicy texture that i'm accustomed to at the pink's in la. i firmly believe that if you're going to call yourself pink's <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark>, you better serve it up like it's pink's <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark>! \n\nam i being a bit overdramatic? maybe. but think of it like this... what if you walked into a mcdonald's and ordered a big mac but it ended up looking like and tasting like something that came from an elementary school cafeteria? or out of the back of some fat guy's ass? what then? i would rather pass out in the bosom of an obese woman with three eyes, one large breast and one little breast, and a tentacle hanging from her double-chin than eat another of those things. \n\nif not for beer and gambling, i would have done nothing that entire weekend in vegas but complain that it's not the same. and since i'm not in vegas and i'm sober, i'll say it anyway... \n\nit's not the same!!", 
            "on my last day in vegas, i went on a search for this pink's <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> as i was told by my girlfriend that their <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> are suppose to be really good.  i guess it is more than a <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark>, it's an experience.  well...experience is the right word for it.  they not only have regular dogs, but they have specialty dogs as well with everything imaginable on top.\n\nfirst...the entrance to pinks is from the sidewalk on the strip.  i was parked in the back parking garage, so coming from the backside of the miracle mile, i was lost.  i thought pinks was inside or would have an entrance from the inside.  they do not.  i walked around for about 20 min. trying to find it before i realized it was outside.\n\nlooking over the menu i just didn't want to have an old fashioned <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark>, i wanted to try one of their special dogs.  i ordered up a <mark>Planet Hollywood Dog</mark>, which is a <mark>Plain Polish Sausage</mark> with cheese sauce, mushrooms, <mark>Grilled Onion</mark> and bacon.  they have a list of other dogs as well for anything you are craving.  my order arrived and i was ready to eat.  \n\nwell...it was an experience that's for sure!  trying to eat this huge dog with all the toppings gave a new meaning to messy!  i had to finish with a fork because it was just too much!\n\nwhile the prices of <mark>The Showgirl Dog</mark> are a bit high ($8 for my ph dog), it's a good place to try a specialty dog while you are in vegas.  would i try it again?  possibly...", 
            "being a huge travel channel fan, i have often seen pink's <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> on the shows featured on there. luckily it was right in my hotel, planet hollywood. i was able to try the <mark><mark><mark><mark>Nacho Cheese</mark> <mark>Polish <mark>Bacon Chili <mark>Polish <mark>Brooklyn Pastrami <mark>Swiss Cheese</mark> Dog</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark> (minus the mustard & onions), fries, and <mark>Onion Ring</mark>. the fries and <mark>Onion Ring</mark> were really good and the chili on <mark>The Showgirl Dog</mark> had great flavor to it!\n\nminus 2 stars for how slow the line moves and the higher than usual prices (but i guess it's expected since it is right on the strip).",

            "purely average at best.  for $9.00 <mark>The Showgirl Dog</mark> was not up to standards in taste, quality and size.  the combo fries and <mark>Onion Ring</mark> were average also.  four of us ate here and all had the same opinion of pink's.  you can do much better on the strip.", 
            "ever since seeing the original pink's highlighted on a food channel travelogue, i've always wanted to give this a whirl. since central la isn't high on my list of visited places, i'll settle for a branch office.\n\nthe \"snap\" of <mark>The Showgirl Dog</mark> was just amazing! i had mine with mustard, onions, and kraut. that's how i like it, and i liked it. i asked the counter staff whether i should get fries or <mark>Onion Ring</mark>. they said, \"how about half and half?\" nice touch. after trying both, i would have opted for all rings. very good.", 
            "we tried 4 different dogs and they were ok at best. the buns weren't super fresh and <mark>The Showgirl Dog</mark> themselves didn't taste great. <mark>The Showgirl Dog</mark> were covered with toppings which probably helped to hide the bad taste of <mark>The Showgirl Dog</mark>. but they had a wide selection and various types of <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> and sausages to pick from.", 
            "nothing special here, <mark>The Showgirl Dog</mark> is ok, as is the bun.  the chili was bland and the fries ok.  there are a lot better food options in the area i would probably pass pink's by next time around."

            "oh pink's, how you have been able to somewhat redeem yourself. going to college in los angeles, you're bound to go to pink's at least once. after having it there, i really thought this place was overrated. the <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> were just ok, and were definitely not worth the wait in line (at least 30 minutes).\n\nbecause of that, i really did not want to give this location a chance. however, we were leaving las vegas and wanted something were it would've be relatively quick. hesitantly, i agreed to go to pink's. and you know what, i'm really glad i did.\n\nfor those that do not know where pink's is, it's outside on the strip. when we got here, i was honestly surprised that there was no line here. i had to initially do a double take to make sure i was at the right location. there were the familiar pictures of celebrities on the wall which helped me know that i was at the right place.\n\ndue to being hungry, i ordered <mark>The Spicy Mojave Dog</mark> and the <mark>Guadalajara Dog</mark>. the <mark>Guadalajara Dog</mark> was good, the mix of <mark>Sour Cream</mark>, tomatoes, and relish was a nice combination with the <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark>. i'm not the biggest fan of relish, but i liked it in this case. <mark>The Spicy Mojave Dog</mark> was pretty awesome. to warn you in advance, make sure you have napkins, a fork, and a knife. i rarely eat <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> with a knife and fork, but in this case, you must! the <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> have a nice pop when you take a bite, which i love in a <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark>.\n\nthere's no room to eat inside, but there are tables outside for you to sit and enjoy the strip on a nice warm day. especially after a big night of partying, this is a nice way to recover. \n\noverall, i'd give it 3.5 stars. the reason i rounded it down to a 3 was due to my experiences at the hollywood location. though i'll definitely would come back to this location whenever i'm in vegas.",

            "i have long heard about pink's <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> being a go-to hot spot late at night for grub and the chance to run into celebrities out in hollywood but have never had the chance to go.  thus i was really excited when i saw that pink's had opened a storefront right on the strip in vegas.  \n\nafter a long night of debauchery, i walked halfway across the strip just so i could eat at pink's.  i have to give them credit, they sure know how to jazz up a <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark>.  i ordered a <mark>The Spicy Mojave Dog</mark>, which is a <mark>Plain Polish Sausage</mark> with <mark>Nacho Cheese</mark>, guacamole and jalape\\u00f1o peppers on it.  i ordered relish on it as well.  \n\nthe combination works well in theory as well as in practice.  but in practice all of that stuff on a <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> makes it damn near impossible to eat as you would normally.  picking it up makes all the toppings fall off, and a sloppy mess gets all over your hands.  so i had to resort to eating <mark>The Showgirl Dog</mark> with a fork and knife.  i felt pretty stupid, but it was the only way to do it and plenty of people around me were doing the same.  \n\nbut eating like that made the bun soggy, which is not good.  i appreciate the effort they put into dressing up a <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark>, but i only give it three stars because i've had amazing \"gourmet\" <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> in chicago before, with toppings piled high, but with which i could still eat as <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> are intended to be eaten - with your hands.", 
            "i believe i got <mark>The Spicy Mojave Dog</mark>, which was topped with cheese, salsa, jalapenos, and guacamole. it was heavenly, to put it short. i don't understand why people give it 2-3 stars for being hard to eat without forks and spoons. well, it's topped with goodies, duh!\nthe reason i gave it a 4-star was bc i ordered a coleslaw. worst slaw i ever had. i think it was b/c they used something other than cabbage. but can't blame it on others, who orders a slaw at a <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> place? lesson learned!",

            "i was getting a little hungry in the afternoon after walking so much and decided to get a quick bite to eat at pink's. the key word here is decided to get a quick bite to eat. when we jumped in line, there were only 10 other people in front of us but it took nearly 30 minutes just to get up to the counter to order. this place is freakin' slow! while we were waiting in line for 30 minutes the line grew to epic proportions... easily like 50+ people behind us in line. i hate to think what they had to wait at the end just to order.\n\ni ended up ordering a <mark><mark><mark>Nacho Cheese</mark> <mark>Polish <mark>Bacon Chili <mark>Polish <mark>Brooklyn Pastrami <mark>Swiss Cheese</mark> Dog</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark> with a side of fries (it only took me 45 seconds from pulling up to the counter to order to leaving the line and not the average of 3 minutes to order per person. it isn't that hard.). the <mark><mark><mark>Nacho Cheese</mark> <mark>Polish <mark>Bacon Chili <mark>Polish <mark>Brooklyn Pastrami <mark>Swiss Cheese</mark> Dog</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark> was good... slightly above average for a <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark>. \n\nthe problem with pink's is the wait time to order to taste ratio. its good to try once but it definitely isn't worth the wait. the second thing is the seating area outside is very very small. if you come at a busy time, you might have to hover until you find a place to sit. it didn't happen with me, but i can see it happening.",

            "first off, this is nothing like the pinks in la. i've been living in san diego for a year now, after having lived in la and i miss pinks. so when i was in vegas and saw pinks on the strip i got really excited. as soon as i walked in, i should have known. this place is everything pink and looks like a retro 50's diner. this caught me off guard considering the real pinks is basically a rundown bungalow covered in photographs and the only thing that's actually pink is the sign out front. next was the menu. i didn't recognize a single 'special <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark>'. the original pinks special <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> either have a la themed name or are named after a celebrity. the pinks in las vegas has special dogs named with a las vegas theme. so i had to ask the girl at the front counter if they knew which dogs were renamed and which dog was the martha stewart dog. she had a list behind the counter that listed which special <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> were renamed but she told me that most of their special dogs were not their own creations, not renamed dogs from the original location. uhhhh... ok. so basically this pinks is a completely different restaurant with the name pinks slapped on.\n\nnow for the food. i ordered a <mark><mark><mark>Nacho Cheese</mark> <mark>Polish <mark>Bacon Chili <mark>Polish <mark>Brooklyn Pastrami <mark>Swiss Cheese</mark> Dog</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark> (with a <mark>Plain Polish Sausage</mark> subbed for the <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark>) with mustard and a side of fries, totally $13 and some odd cents. i waited a few minutes and my order number was called. i went to retrieve my food and got really confused as soon as i saw the <mark>French Fries</mark> which are nothing like the la pinks <mark>French Fries</mark>. i made a comment to the person who gave me my food about it looking nothing like food from the original pinks, and a woman, also from la, walked up behind me and said the same. \n\nso was the food good? yeah, it was decent. but not worth the 13 bucks i spent on it. the shoe-string fries were nothing like the cajun fries (that the la pinks serves) i was expecting but the were good nonetheless. worth the $5.99 i paid for them? no. but that's what you get for eating on the strip. the <mark>Plain Polish Sausage</mark> was pretty good and the chili was... not so flavorful. but overall i'm glad i tried it.\n\nthe verdict: if you're on the strip near planet hollywood and craving <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark>, this is probably the best you'll find. however, if you're a lover of the original pinks and have your heart set on your usual order, don't come here. you'll leave with a craving that wasn't curbed, disappointed, and with a wallet that weighs less than when you walked in.",

Turkey Dog</mark> listed on their menu!  yay!  i ordered one, dressed as a <mark>Chicago <mark>Polish <mark>Brooklyn Pastrami <mark>Swiss Cheese</mark> Dog</mark></mark></mark> and my partner ordered a beef <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> with minimal toppings. we skipped out on fries as we just wanted a light snack, but we did each get a drink (beer and cider in cans). \n\nwe sat outside in the awesome weather and dug in. my <mark>Plain Veggie Dog (Soy) or 1/4 Lb. Turkey Dog</mark> was covered in amazing toppings and was delicious. i had to get a fork to clean up the bits that dropped out, i didn't want to leave anything behind. my partner enjoyed his meal as well, and we were able to leave knowing that we both got exactly what we wanted.\n\nthanks for carrying a <mark>Plain Veggie Dog (Soy) or 1/4 Lb. Turkey Dog</mark> when very few others are pink's!", 
            "wow, has it really been 5 years since my last review at pink's??  well, other than satisfy my craving for a <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark>, nothing's really changed from my last experience here except for the prices which have increased since then.\n\nchicago <mark>Polish <mark>Bacon Chili <mark>Polish <mark>Brooklyn Pastrami <mark>Swiss Cheese</mark> Dog</mark></mark></mark></mark> -- http://bit.ly/1fssnto\nmustard, relish, lettuce & tomatoes\nthe <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> was good but it was basically a salad on a <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark>.  because it's on their classic dog side of the menu, the price wasn't too bad but still pricey though for what i got.  i guess i probably should've ordered the <mark>Planet Hollywood Dog</mark> (http://bit.ly/1jikjji) again because at least it has more of a 'wow' factor.\n\nfor convenience on being right on the strip, i like pink's.  but i think i'd rather get my gourmet <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> fix off the strip at buldogis or even at g<mark>Plain Veggie Dog (Soy) or 1/4 Lb. Turkey Dog</mark> ramsay burgr.", 
            "i'd have to say that my experience here was neither good or bad. there were many different style <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> on the menu to choose from. the cashier was super friendly and inviting. we ordered a mushroom <mark>Polish <mark>Brooklyn Pastrami <mark>Swiss Cheese</mark> Dog</mark></mark> and a <mark>Vegas Strip Dog</mark>, both of which were under $8 each. the <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> i have to say in my opinion were bland. i don't think the flavors were anything exciting or memorable. i was most disappointed with my mushroom <mark>Polish <mark>Brooklyn Pastrami <mark>Swiss Cheese</mark> Dog</mark></mark> because i felt the mushrooms were too rubbery and flavorless. however, it was nice to sit outside with the water mist to cool us down.",

            "after hearing so much hype about the pink's in la, i could not wait to finally try their famous <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> when i was in vegas. the line, was what i expected it to be.. long. what made the wait seem 10x longer was the fact that the actual place is so small that once about 5 people are inside, the rest of the line is waiting outside in the scorching heat. in a way i was glad that there was a line so that my party and i would have time to browse the menu. i also noticed their had a few special celebrity <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark>, which certain celebrities conned, obviously. there were <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> by holly madison and kim kardashian, and a few others too. after a few minutes, i decided on the swiss mushroom <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark>, which was a <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> with <mark>Swiss Cheese</mark>, mayo, and of course, mushrooms. my mom got the chili cheese and <mark>Bacon Chili <mark>Polish <mark>Brooklyn Pastrami <mark>Swiss Cheese</mark> Dog</mark></mark></mark> while my dad played it safer with just the <mark><mark><mark>Nacho Cheese</mark> <mark>Polish <mark>Bacon Chili <mark>Polish <mark>Brooklyn Pastrami <mark>Swiss Cheese</mark> Dog</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark>. i must say that i was definitely not impressed with any of the <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> we ordered. i am a fan of mayo but the amount of mayo on my <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> was just way too much for my liking. the mushrooms were almost flavorless and the cheese was not even melted; it was as if it was just placed on top of the <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> for decoration. although my parents' chili cheese <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> were pretty similar, besides the bacon on my mom's, they were nothing special at all. i think i would have enjoyed a <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> from top dog in berkeley or even a <mark><mark><mark>Nacho Cheese</mark> <mark>Polish <mark>Bacon Chili <mark>Polish <mark>Brooklyn Pastrami <mark>Swiss Cheese</mark> Dog</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark> from wienerschnitzel.. would have saved us a few dollars, too. i don't know about ya'll but $7-8 for a <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> topped with basic kitchen ingredients just doesn't seem right. maybe the la location is better? but will i ever know? nope, because i doubt i'll go outta my way to try another one of their <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark>.",

            "went to my first pink's of any kind today. heading into the first bite, i definitely did have high expectations, mainly because i was hungry, and also because the prices looked pretty darn high, even after accounting for the recent groupon deal. however, keep in mind that this in in the heart of the las vegas strip, so really you'd almost expect it to be pricey. it's not fair to compare this to costco <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> on price.\n\nwhen i tried my friend's <mark><mark><mark>Nacho Cheese</mark> <mark>Polish <mark>Bacon Chili <mark>Polish <mark>Brooklyn Pastrami <mark>Swiss Cheese</mark> Dog</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark>, my eyes, taste <mark>Bud</mark>, and probably everything else just lit up. yeah, hunger is the best sauce or whatever, but every component of that dog - bun, sausage, chili, and <mark>Grilled Onion</mark> - was really delicious and made me wish that i had chosen it. instead, i had gone with the <mark>Planet Hollywood Dog</mark>, which was also quite tasty with bacon and some sort of enhanced 'shrooms. i also loved the <mark>Plain Polish Sausage</mark>, which is fatter than the normal wiener, and the <mark>Nacho Cheese</mark> went surprisingly well with the rest of the ingredients.\n\nwe also shared some deluxe chili <mark><mark><mark>Deluxe Chili Cheese Fries</mark></mark></mark>, which had a crapload of toppings on them. in hindsight, if i had known how loaded the <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> would be, i would've ordered normal fries for about half the price because my friend was pretty much evacuating his toppings onto the fries. oh well, live and learn.\n\nanyway, i've seen the other reviews, and i'm sure it doesn't match everything that people like about the original pink's - which i still hope to go to some day - but it's still good eating. not considering the price, the only problem i have is that i'd rather go to earl of sandwich, which is right next door and which i love to death, so i might not really see this place much at all in the future. oh well, it was yummy knowing you.", 
            "you know what? this place is just as disappointing as the one in la, minus the waiting time.\n\nlet's start with the fries. thin, too crispy, hallow. it's like mcd's fries but hallowed out. and the cheese they throw on for the chili <mark><mark><mark>Deluxe Chili Cheese Fries</mark></mark></mark> is disgusting nacho-cheese type shit that comes from a huge industrial container type thing. it's gross.\n\nthe <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> are less than stellar. they don't taste anything better than what i can buy at a supermarket. let's talk toppings. just as bad. why are my mushrooms cold, wet, and straight out of a can? canned mushrooms are disgusting. especially when they're still wet. my swiss is not even half melted.\n\nyou get one point for being fast, and decently cheap. and you open until 1am. guys, don't come here. go inside planet hollywood, turn the corner, and visit earl of sandwiches. they're open 24hrs.", 
            "this should probably be a 3.5 star review - but since you can't do that, and i can't give pink's a 4 star review, i'm going with the 3. i ended up ordering a chili-<mark><mark><mark>Nacho Cheese</mark> <mark>Polish <mark>Bacon Chili <mark>Polish <mark>Brooklyn Pastrami <mark>Swiss Cheese</mark> Dog</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark> and a dog with mustard, sauerkraut and relish. although not the best <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> i've ever had, i do have to say that they were probably the most filled <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> i've ever had. there was almost a bowl full of chili on the chili-<mark><mark><mark>Nacho Cheese</mark> <mark>Polish <mark>Bacon Chili <mark>Polish <mark>Brooklyn Pastrami <mark>Swiss Cheese</mark> Dog</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark>, and a pot full of kraut on the other dog. so if you're hungry, i would definitely go here. i had to eat both of my <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> (didn't finish them..lol..) with a fork and knife - there is that much stuff on them. if you aren't starving, do yourself a favor and order one <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark>. also, if you want to have fries - you can split an order amongst 3 people - they're huge. but, size doesn't always equate to quality, and the quality of <mark>The Showgirl Dog</mark> is just a little lacking (not much though).", 
            "i've always heard about pink's while living in colorado and i actually discovered it by watching the travel channel best eats show. the location in atlanta is the prime location for pink's but the one out here in vegas is on point as well! i had my very first experience 5 days ago and ordered the bacon <mark><mark><mark>Nacho Cheese</mark> <mark>Polish <mark>Bacon Chili <mark>Polish <mark>Brooklyn Pastrami <mark>Swiss Cheese</mark> Dog</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark> and and corona to wash it down. needless to say i smashed it! lol but it was so much food i didn't know where to begin and take my first bite. whatever you do bite high and at an angle or it'll be all over the place. then bite low at an angle on the 2nd bite, and repeat! my new favorite place to get a quick bite :-)", 
            "in my experience, finding a decent <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> when you don't eat red meat or pork is pretty tough.  i had all but given up on the idea of enjoying a sloppy dog... that is, until i went to pink's.  \n\ni had friends in town who were massively hungover, so they chose pink's <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> as their pick-me-up spot.  i usually just order a side dish (hello, fried food) at this type of joint, but then something caught my eye.  a quarter-pound turkey <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark>??  could it be???\n\ni took the chance, and ordered the <mark>Plain Veggie Dog (Soy) or 1/4 Lb. Turkey Dog</mark> with a simple dressing of ketchup and relish.  i keep it classic.  and what they served looked more like a kielbasa or bratwurst, it was so big.  thick, juicy, and great flavor.  success!  \n\nlong story longer, i will definitely be visiting pink's again.  great location, great atmosphere (outside seating), and great food.  the <mark>Onion Ring</mark> and <mark><mark><mark>Deluxe Chili Cheese Fries</mark></mark></mark> rocked as well.  bravo, pink's!", 
            "pink's serves a good dog. but with all the hype i expected more. the toppings are unique and <mark>The Showgirl Dog</mark> are good sized, but at $8/$9 a pop they should be. thanks to groupon, the wife and i have been here twice in the last month. both times we waddled away very content. we had a variety of dogs, <mark>Polish <mark>Bacon Chili <mark>Polish <mark>Brooklyn Pastrami <mark>Swiss Cheese</mark> Dog</mark></mark></mark></mark>, and even a pastrami/<mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> burrito. all very good. the <mark>Onion Ring</mark> are thick and crunchy. i'm a great fan of windy city beefs-n-dogs on lake mead, so i'm not sure if i will be back, but it was fun trying pink's out.", 
            "first off, this is nothing like the pinks in la. i've been living in san diego for a year now, after having lived in la and i miss pinks. so when i was in vegas and saw pinks on the strip i got really excited. as soon as i walked in, i should have known. this place is everything pink and looks like a retro 50's diner. this caught me off guard considering the real pinks is basically a rundown bungalow covered in photographs and the only thing that's actually pink is the sign out front. next was the menu. i didn't recognize a single 'special <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark>'. the original pinks special <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> either have a la themed name or are named after a celebrity. the pinks in las vegas has special dogs named with a las vegas theme. so i had to ask the girl at the front counter if they knew which dogs were renamed and which dog was the martha stewart dog. she had a list behind the counter that listed which special <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> were renamed but she told me that most of their special dogs were not their own creations, not renamed dogs from the original location. uhhhh... ok. so basically this pinks is a completely different restaurant with the name pinks slapped on.\n\nnow for the food. i ordered a <mark><mark><mark>Nacho Cheese</mark> <mark>Polish <mark>Bacon Chili <mark>Polish <mark>Brooklyn Pastrami <mark>Swiss Cheese</mark> Dog</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark> (with a <mark>Plain Polish Sausage</mark> subbed for the <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark>) with mustard and a side of fries, totally $13 and some odd cents. i waited a few minutes and my order number was called. i went to retrieve my food and got really confused as soon as i saw the <mark>French Fries</mark> which are nothing like the la pinks <mark>French Fries</mark>. i made a comment to the person who gave me my food about it looking nothing like food from the original pinks, and a woman, also from la, walked up behind me and said the same. \n\nso was the food good? yeah, it was decent. but not worth the 13 bucks i spent on it. the shoe-string fries were nothing like the cajun fries (that the la pinks serves) i was expecting but the were good nonetheless. worth the $5.99 i paid for them? no. but that's what you get for eating on the strip. the <mark>Plain Polish Sausage</mark> was pretty good and the chili was... not so flavorful. but overall i'm glad i tried it.\n\nthe verdict: if you're on the strip near planet hollywood and craving <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark>, this is probably the best you'll find. however, if you're a lover of the original pinks and have your heart set on your usual order, don't come here. you'll leave with a craving that wasn't curbed, disappointed, and with a wallet that weighs less than when you walked in.", 
            "call me cheap, but without a deal, i would not have come to pink's on my own account, knowing it's hyped, mediocre, and over-priced <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark>. luckily, i used a groupon deal that allowed me to try pink's at an affordable price.\n\nthe stand is located outside the miracle mile shops, with no access from the planet hollywood casino. we learned that the hard way. -_-\n\ni ordered the brooklyn pastrami swiss <mark><mark><mark>Nacho Cheese</mark> <mark>Polish <mark>Bacon Chili <mark>Polish <mark>Brooklyn Pastrami <mark>Swiss Cheese</mark> Dog</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark>. i like keeping my dogs plain, and dressed with mustard. so i enjoyed this dog, but would have liked it even more if the pastrami came out hot, rather than lukewarm.\n\ni also sampled some of the bf's <mark><mark>Poli Bacon Burrito Dog</mark></mark> (2 dogs, bacon, chili, cheese, onions). we ordered <mark>The Showgirl Dog</mark> without onions, but it came out standard, so he brought it back to have it re-made. the cook was nice about it, probably because there was hardly a line at 4 pm, and served up a new one within 3 minutes, spit-free! it was interesting... glad we tried, but wouldn't order it again. it is also best eaten with the wrapper, because the burrito drips chili grease... yum!\n\nwith our $15 groupon, we had to fork out a whopping $0.52. overall, $7.52... i would not mind paying that price, but $15.52 is a bit steep for 2 dogs. i'd rather use that money to buy 2 sammiches from earl's inside. i'll be back once i get my hands on another deal!",

            "wanting for many years to visit the hollywood location, i jumped at the chance to finally taste one of these famous dogs albeit in the planet hollywood in las vegas. it probably isn't the same experience, but hey, it was a pretty good <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark>. it's located right on the strip, outside of the planet hollywood hotel and casino. there is a gated off area outside to sit and eat that is cooled by mist fans. it was still hot, but i was enjoying my dog too much to care.\n\ni ordered the bacon <mark><mark><mark>Nacho Cheese</mark> <mark>Polish <mark>Bacon Chili <mark>Polish <mark>Brooklyn Pastrami <mark>Swiss Cheese</mark> Dog</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark>. it was a mouth watering experience with the popping <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> casing, to the beefy flavor, the addition of chili, and the paramount additive that is crispy bacon. the crusty sweet <mark>Onion Ring</mark> put it all over the top. honestly on this trip, this was probably the best <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> i had. the other being from nathan's in ny ny (http://www.yelp.com/biz/nathans-famous-hot-dogs-las-vegas), but i'm sure it was a result of the fashion in which it was prepared (i.e. griddle which is best vs hot rollers).\n\nyeah, i didn't see any hollywood stars but who cares. i was there for the <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> and it was really good.",

            "i've heard a lot about this place and i think i was expecting too much from the <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark>. honestly, they didn't taste special to me at all. it was a good <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark>, but definitely not worth the hype. we ordered the <mark>Vegas Strip Dog</mark> which came with 2 <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark>, guacamole, jalapenos, chili cheese, mustard and onions. we also got the <mark>Planet Hollywood Dog</mark> which was a <mark>Polish <mark>Bacon Chili <mark>Polish <mark>Brooklyn Pastrami <mark>Swiss Cheese</mark> Dog</mark></mark></mark></mark> that came with <mark>Grilled Onion</mark>, mushroom, bacon and cheese. both tasted decent. the chili <mark><mark><mark>Deluxe Chili Cheese Fries</mark></mark></mark> were mediocre. it was worth a shot but i don't plan on visiting this place again.", 
            "thoroughly over-rated!\n\n7.50$ for a greasy <mark>Plain Polish Sausage</mark>, covered in \"chili\" that looks like a pile of poo-poo & tastes accordingly (( this stuff looked synthetic - im talking taco bell might be better)\n\nthe sausage was okay but it was super salty and greasy, the bun was completely soggy (think wonderbread) & the chilli was honestly repulsive (i scooped as much as possible off before eating)\n\nthe relish and <mark>Grilled Onion</mark> were the only things that saved the day.\n\ni would seriously pick the  costco <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark>/<mark>Plain Polish Sausage</mark> over this stuff any day!", 
            "i don't know what they we're thinking with this pink's. most if not all <mark>The Showgirl Dog</mark> offered in hollywood have been replaced or renamed for vegas. i was so confused. \n\neither way, i went with the desert named one, sonora or what have you. it came loaded in a fry dolly. bun, dog, <mark>Grilled Onion</mark>, <mark>Nacho Cheese</mark>, and jalape\\u00f1os. i think i got it all, honestly j could have forgot something. there was so much junk on it that i couldn't pick it up and ha to cradle it with the fry holder. \n\nit was a huge mess that didn't taste amazing but got the job done. i was hungover as usual and this was a good fix. throw a cold beer in, and i was good to go. \n\ni won't return, it's a tourist spot that doesn't need to be there. pack up shop and move to hollywood where you could alleviate the long lines at the flagship joint.", 
            "for a celebrity <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> craze..... it's good! \n\ntheir #1 is the bacon chili cheese: topped with onions, tomatoes, chili, cheese and bacon... not really my cup of tea.\n\ntheir #2 is the planet hollywood (fitting, considering their located @ ph) and it's pretty bomb! <mark>Grilled Onion</mark>, mushrooms, cheese and bacon! \n\nthe best compliment they offer i'd have to say is the <mark>Onion Ring</mark>:)\n\ntheir downfall, hence the 2 stars: their staff and lack of customer service!!!\n\nseriously... \n\n#1: you sell <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark>!!! not diamonds! i guess a smile and a skosh of patience would be a stretch, no?\n#2: you are the cashier!!! if you're gonna have that kind of impatient demeanor, you think it'd be more fitting to stock up inventory in the back or something right???\n\nwow.", 
            "wow! best. <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark>. ever!\n\ni forget the name of the <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> i ordered but it was a <mark>Plain Polish Sausage</mark>, cheese, <mark>Grilled Onion</mark> and mushrooms (i think it was the ph <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> but i could be wrong).. a-freakin'-mazing! toppings over load! there were lots of <mark>Grilled Onion</mark> and mushrooms which i much appreciated because most places are so skimpy with the toppings. the <mark>Plain Polish Sausage</mark> was fat and juicy, just the way i like them ;)\nboyfriend got the <mark>Polish <mark>Brooklyn Pastrami <mark>Swiss Cheese</mark> Dog</mark></mark> with just a <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark>, pastrami and mustard - i don't like mustard so i didn't get to try a bite but he said it was good and i'll trust him on that. i can't imagine it being anything amazing like mine though because it just seems so plain!\n\ncan't say to much for the service because you wait in line, walk up, order and pick up your food at the next spot so there isn't too much interaction with the employees. but i can say the girl who took my order was very friendly and patience because i still wasn't sure of what i wanted and i didn't feel rushed by her at all.\n\nsomeone please open a pink's in the bay!!!", 
            "i was looking forward to trying this place out all weekend!\n\nafter having drinks all day and night, i really wanted something bad.. real bad for me..\n\ni decided to order a <mark>Planet Hollywood Dog</mark>.  this had bacon, <mark>Grilled Onion</mark>, mushrooms, and <mark>Nacho Cheese</mark> on top of a <mark>Polish <mark>Bacon Chili <mark>Polish <mark>Brooklyn Pastrami <mark>Swiss Cheese</mark> Dog</mark></mark></mark></mark>.  let me tell ya, it was exactly what i was craving.  it was a bit on the salty side though.  i was already dehydrated enough, the bacon was real salty... and i love salty things ;)  other than that, i've never had a <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> so yummy and so big!  i couldn't finish it.\n\nthe wait wasn't too bad when we came and actually getting our dogs didn't take long either.  i liked the environment, it was fun and exciting.\n\ni'll probably come back here when i have a huge appetite and i haven't done my make-up.  by the end of eating your dog, you've wiped off all the <mark>Nacho Cheese</mark> that's gotten on your face and your freshly put on make-up!", 
            "3.5 stars again.  i don't know how i ended up here, but i did!  got <mark>Grilled Mushroom</mark> and <mark>Grilled Onion</mark> this time.  not the best (i'm a veggie though), but pretty damn good, and it's quick and filling!\n\nnote: for meat-eaters... every time i go here, i hear someone say to their friend \"get everything on it\"", 
            "we are a little spoiled living in chicago, because we have every cuisine here!  however, something as simple as a <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> should not be that difficult, but i have had some from other places and trust me they were a fail. we tried pinks while in las vegas i had a turkey <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> with mayo, mustard, <mark>Grilled Onion</mark>, mushrooms, and cheese. ( i forgive them for asking me if i want ketchup, i live in chicago we dont do ketchup on a <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark>). i have to admit it was a pleasant surprise, and i am kinda bummed out that i didnt make it to pinks one more time before leaving lv but i am definately a fan!", 
            "went to my first pink's of any kind today. heading into the first bite, i definitely did have high expectations, mainly because i was hungry, and also because the prices looked pretty darn high, even after accounting for the recent groupon deal. however, keep in mind that this in in the heart of the las vegas strip, so really you'd almost expect it to be pricey. it's not fair to compare this to costco <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> on price.\n\nwhen i tried my friend's <mark><mark><mark>Nacho Cheese</mark> <mark>Polish <mark>Bacon Chili <mark>Polish <mark>Brooklyn Pastrami <mark>Swiss Cheese</mark> Dog</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark>, my eyes, taste <mark>Bud</mark>, and probably everything else just lit up. yeah, hunger is the best sauce or whatever, but every component of that dog - bun, sausage, chili, and <mark>Grilled Onion</mark> - was really delicious and made me wish that i had chosen it. instead, i had gone with the <mark>Planet Hollywood Dog</mark>, which was also quite tasty with bacon and some sort of enhanced 'shrooms. i also loved the <mark>Plain Polish Sausage</mark>, which is fatter than the normal wiener, and the <mark>Nacho Cheese</mark> went surprisingly well with the rest of the ingredients.\n\nwe also shared some deluxe chili <mark><mark><mark>Deluxe Chili Cheese Fries</mark></mark></mark>, which had a crapload of toppings on them. in hindsight, if i had known how loaded the <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> would be, i would've ordered normal fries for about half the price because my friend was pretty much evacuating his toppings onto the fries. oh well, live and learn.\n\nanyway, i've seen the other reviews, and i'm sure it doesn't match everything that people like about the original pink's - which i still hope to go to some day - but it's still good eating. not considering the price, the only problem i have is that i'd rather go to earl of sandwich, which is right next door and which i love to death, so i might not really see this place much at all in the future. oh well, it was yummy knowing you.", 
            "for all the hype and love this place gets, it really isn't good. in fact, it was gross. i'd rather go to mcdonalds, at least bad food is cheap there. \n\nthe <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark>, the actual meat part of it tasted acceptable, but not good. and they were too skinny. skinny <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> are for suckers. go big or go home. if i get a dog, i want it to be mostly meat inside the bun and all the other toppings pouring out of the top of it. thats a <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark>. a skinny <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> covered in onions is as dissatisfying as, well a skinny <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> covered in onions. the \"grilled\" onions had clearly only been acquainted with the grill top for a few seconds before hoping on to the long twig that was my <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark>, and didn't have any of that yummy caramelized taste that real <mark>Grilled Onion</mark> have. the pastrami was plain and dry. call me picky but isn't pastrami supposed to taste like something other than newspaper? i've never had pastrami this disgusting. and i've had a lot of pastrami in my time. you can make yourself a better dog for a 5th of the price by going to the deli section at your local grocery store. this was like an imitation that reminds you of a real <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark>, if a real <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> were a gross, tasteless and pathetic lump of turd.\n\nthe only thing keeping this from being a 1 star review was that they sell booze. and i was able to finish half of my friend's giant margarita and get enough of a brain freeze to forget how gross and skinny that <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> was.", 
            "i love <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark>!  it is my go-to, guilty pleasure when i am hungry in between meals.  trying to find a good one in vegas use to be very tough until i found pink's right outside planet hollywood.  you can pretty much have any style dog with any toppings your heart desires.  i had an all beef dog loaded with sauerkraut, <mark>Grilled Onion</mark> and peppers and plenty of mustard.  it was delish!  my only complaint here is that the people taking your order are rude and seem rushed.  the seating is horrible.  we sat outside and pigeons constantly invade your space which is very annoying.  i actually saw idiots feeding them which only encourages them to stick around.  in addition to this, the place was unclean which really turns me off.  i will still stop here on future visits but will get my dog to go.", 
            "i had the ph <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> and it was pretty good.  it's loaded w/ bacon, <mark>Grilled Onion</mark>, <mark>Nacho Cheese</mark>, and some mushrooms.  the <mark>Nacho Cheese</mark> kinda masked the taste of the <mark>Plain Polish Sausage</mark>, i think next time i'll get it w/ just a light amount of cheese.  the <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> itself is pretty huge too (to the point it's almost difficult to eat lol).  the price tag is reasonable, at $9 i felt this was a decent deal.\n\nmy <mark>Bud</mark> ordered some weird stuff that had <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> wrapped in tortillas or actual burritos.  i'd pass on this weird stuff as it didn't look good.  if you are coming to pinks then order a <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark>, don't order this weird stuff.  that's like ordering a burger at a taco joint lol. \n\ntip-\n-grab a fat tuesday just in the same shopping plaza of ph!  \n-pass on getting the <mark>Onion Ring</mark> (rating 2/5).  they were so sweet they tasted horrible\n-eating only availabe in the outdoor patio.  so if it's in the middle of the day i probably wouldn't eat here.  just come here for late night eats", 
            "after seeing so many television programs about pink's and how amazing it is, i had to try it when i was in vegas.  i ordered the <mark>Planet Hollywood Dog</mark> which is a <mark>Plain Polish Sausage</mark> in a bun with <mark>Grilled Onion</mark>, <mark>Grilled Mushroom</mark>, bacon, and <mark>Nacho Cheese</mark>.  the onions and mushrooms were scarce and barely grilled. the <mark>Nacho Cheese</mark> was just the normal <mark>Nacho Cheese</mark> you get anywhere else.  there were about 5 strips of crispy bacon, but that didn't seem to justify the price of $8.99.  the sausage wasn't even particularly amazing either.  \n\ni also didn't like how cramped <mark>The Showgirl Dog</mark> and overall space was.  only two parties can stand in line before people must wait outside in the 100+ degree weather.  while the seating area did have fans, they were so powerful that they were more bothersome than pleasant - my napkins kept flying away and my hair flew in my face!\n\ni'm glad i checked it off of my places to try, but i wouldn't go back again.  i'd much rather spend $1.50 at costco and get a soda as well!", 
            "so this place is awesome.  don't come here looking for something healthy -- come here to splurge and indulge to your hearts content.  \n\ni ordered  the <mark>Planet Hollywood Dog</mark>, which had <mark>Plain Polish Sausage</mark>, <mark>Grilled Onion</mark> & mushrooms, a pancetta-like bacon that was out of this world, all smothered in <mark>Nacho Cheese</mark>.  this was divine.  of course, i could barely finish half of it.  but it was worth every penny and every calorie.  \n\nmy friend ordered the <mark>Vegas Strip Dog</mark>, which had 2 dogs in one bun, mustard, onions, chili, <mark>American Cheese</mark>, guacamole and jalape\\u00f1os.  she said it was just as amazing.  \n\nand of course, we had to get chili <mark><mark><mark>Deluxe Chili Cheese Fries</mark></mark></mark>.  \n\nthe ambiance was fun - we sat on the patio and got to people watch.  it's right in the middle of the vegas strip, so it's a great location.  the cashier was friendly and helpful, the food took maybe 5 minutes to prepare.  it was just a great experience.  if/when i go back to vegas, i will definitely come again!  maybe this time i'll use it as hangover food though.... ;)", 
            "pink's is entering its 73rd year in business. admittedly, when comparing prices with the original los angeles venue, the vegas spot appears much more expensive. predictable.\n\nnot really seeing a deathly spicy option (not saying that i was gonna find one), i got whatever could be interpreted as spicy to some people. <mark>The Spicy Mojave Dog</mark> ($8.49) was my choice. yeah, you read that right. it was gonna basically be $9 with tax for a damn <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark>. <mark>Plain Polish Sausage</mark>, <mark>Nacho Cheese</mark>, pickled jalapenos, <mark>Grilled Onion</mark>, guacamole, and tomatoes.\n\nit looked and tasted like your basic <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> bun here. with the larger <mark>Plain Polish Sausage</mark> and an abundance of toppings, it really needed one of those large gourmet buns to even give me a shot to pick it up. fork and knife would have to do.\n\nflavor-wise, it did the job. it's basically as good as i could have expected this to be. great snap from the <mark>Polish <mark>Bacon Chili <mark>Polish <mark>Brooklyn Pastrami <mark>Swiss Cheese</mark> Dog</mark></mark></mark></mark>. <mark>Nacho Cheese</mark> felt like it came from a container. the veggies and the guacamole tasted fresh. my issue is simply the price. there's no way this poor panda would even want to pay around $9 for a <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark>, even if edible gold was attached to this sucker. besides, i'd take the edible gold and try to extract monetary value from it anyway.\n\ni look at the yelp reviews for the los angeles pink's, and it's around a three-star average, same as the vegas spot. any complaints are likely directed at the price or the <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> not living up to the hype. the line's also longer in l.a., so that probably also affects the reviewer's rating. still, it makes me wonder if the los angeles spot is better.\n\npink's was good for the experience. i can't complain much about the food other than not being able to pick it up. but i also don't want my wallet to have a reason to riot again.", 
            "so we went there to soak up some alcohol like everyone else on a friday night after a hard night of clubbing. the service was prompt and the food hot. hense the 2 stars. \n\nhowever it is worth noting that as a chicagoan i have high expectations for <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> (and pizza of course). so when i walk in and saw chicago style <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> on the menu i got psyched! wrong!\n\nmy friend pointed out that it actually said \"chicago style polish.\" now if you're from the chi you know our polishes are called \"maxwell street polishes\" and if you're a lil older you may even know them as \"jew town polishes\" but not chicago style. but whatever. so my <mark>Bud</mark> orders one for shits and giggles. ugh!\n\nhe gets the thing and it's got lettuce, tomato, and relish (not even neon green). the eff? no celery salt? no peppers? no mustard? no <mark>Grilled Onion</mark>? blasphemy! \n\nmy polish was underwhelming too. i got grilled oinions and mustard on mine. it's worth noting however that the onions were chopped not grilled in slices. gross! \n\nso does pinks do the job? yes. would i go back when i go to vegas? sure i guess. but please for the love of beans take chicago off you menu if you can't get it right. k? thanks!", 
            "ok. i don't know how much better than average these <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> are. buns are standard. we ate the <mark>Planet Hollywood Dog</mark>, which had the potential to be a super guilty, but worth-it experience, but it was just that - standard ingredients of a <mark>Plain Polish Sausage</mark> with <mark>Grilled Onion</mark>, mushrooms, and bacon with <mark>Nacho Cheese</mark>. you can probably just load it up like that at home and make it just as good, or better. maybe i was just expecting more with the hype.",

(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/uqb9ks7lzesghltmuunmea?select=3fcshb9yqxmpuyvnn8fyxa) the bacon was nice and crispy but the <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> was tiny and wasn't anything special. the ones from costco are way bigger! \n\nmy bun was also flimsy and broke in half after 2 bites. it could have used much more chili and the cheese wasn't melted enough. it was still a tasty meal overall but totally not worth the price tag.",

            "first off, this is nothing like the pinks in la. i've been living in san diego for a year now, after having lived in la and i miss pinks. so when i was in vegas and saw pinks on the strip i got really excited. as soon as i walked in, i should have known. this place is everything pink and looks like a retro 50's diner. this caught me off guard considering the real pinks is basically a rundown bungalow covered in photographs and the only thing that's actually pink is the sign out front. next was the menu. i didn't recognize a single 'special <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark>'. the original pinks special <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> either have a la themed name or are named after a celebrity. the pinks in las vegas has special dogs named with a las vegas theme. so i had to ask the girl at the front counter if they knew which dogs were renamed and which dog was the martha stewart dog. she had a list behind the counter that listed which special <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> were renamed but she told me that most of their special dogs were not their own creations, not renamed dogs from the original location. uhhhh... ok. so basically this pinks is a completely different restaurant with the name pinks slapped on.\n\nnow for the food. i ordered a <mark><mark><mark>Nacho Cheese</mark> <mark>Polish <mark>Bacon Chili <mark>Polish <mark>Brooklyn Pastrami <mark>Swiss Cheese</mark> Dog</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark> (with a <mark>Plain Polish Sausage</mark> subbed for the <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark>) with mustard and a side of fries, totally $13 and some odd cents. i waited a few minutes and my order number was called. i went to retrieve my food and got really confused as soon as i saw the <mark>French Fries</mark> which are nothing like the la pinks <mark>French Fries</mark>. i made a comment to the person who gave me my food about it looking nothing like food from the original pinks, and a woman, also from la, walked up behind me and said the same. \n\nso was the food good? yeah, it was decent. but not worth the 13 bucks i spent on it. the shoe-string fries were nothing like the cajun fries (that the la pinks serves) i was expecting but the were good nonetheless. worth the $5.99 i paid for them? no. but that's what you get for eating on the strip. the <mark>Plain Polish Sausage</mark> was pretty good and the chili was... not so flavorful. but overall i'm glad i tried it.\n\nthe verdict: if you're on the strip near planet hollywood and craving <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark>, this is probably the best you'll find. however, if you're a lover of the original pinks and have your heart set on your usual order, don't come here. you'll leave with a craving that wasn't curbed, disappointed, and with a wallet that weighs less than when you walked in.",

            "i had never been to pink's before, but had a groupon that was running out, and so we ventured out for dinner on a late thursday night to beat the deadline.  no problem, right?  by all appearances, it was just an unremarkable thursday night.  \n\nso off to planet hollywood we went.  but when we pulled up to valet parking behind three stretch limos, and no valet was in sight, something seemed off.  then i saw that we were about six blocks from the valet stand, again with no valet in view.  so, off to self-parking we went, with uniformed police everywhere, to find a parking spot.  at length we found one--the only one.  something unusual was definitely going on.\n\nso, diane and i walked from the parking garage into the miracle mile shops, and walked and walked.  as we finally reached the entrance to planet hollywood on the other side of the shopping promenade, 9 uniformed sheriff's deputies were assembled together, and fashionably suited males and well-dressed females were everywhere.  about then i realized that we had left the groupon in the car.  oh, well (sigh).  i decided that i wasn't going to walk all the way back and return again just to save a mere $5!  so, we continued on and out the main doors until we finally saw pink's facing las vegas boulevard, and examined the vast menu on the wall before making our selections.\n\nthis story does end well.  i really enjoyed my brooklyn pastrami swiss <mark><mark><mark>Nacho Cheese</mark> <mark>Polish <mark>Bacon Chili <mark>Polish <mark>Brooklyn Pastrami <mark>Swiss Cheese</mark> Dog</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark> with pickles, onions, mustard, and sauerkraut added, on a soft old country bun.  it included a generous amount of tender pastrami, and although the <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> was thin, it was long and had a very nice snap to it when one bit into the casing.  beer-battered <mark>Onion Ring</mark> and nicely salted shoestring fries were both good and tasty.  and i liked the mild <mark>Nacho Cheese</mark> sauce for dipping my fries, while diane enjoyed <mark>Mini Corn Dogs</mark>.  to my surprise, one single <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> sufficed to quell my appetite.  and, there were free refills of lemonade and all other available soft drinks.  \n\nthe place is nothing fancy, seating is all outside, and there is only counter service.  but staff members were friendly and helpful.  we had a nice view of the strip before us, but it was a mite cold and windy at 10:47 p.m.  heat lamps were present, but not in service.  hard driving music overhead added to the casual ambiance.  so, we finished our food, walked all the way back to the car, and left the parking lot as we were directed out by at least 6 police officers.  just as we were turning onto tropicana avenue, diane asked the last officer if she knew what was going on at planet hollywood, and was told, \"soul train awards!\"\n\nnow i'm sort of glad that i still have my groupon for pink's, which, as luck would have it, does not really expire for another month.  for, it means that i can return again soon to enjoy another tasty classic dog!",

            "pink's is one of those over-hyped places and since this location is in vegas, also super over-priced! it was located right outside the planet hollywood hotel and wasn't hard to find with its bright, pink name etched on the glass. at least there was no line at all when we got there. only outdoor seating so refrain from getting anything too spicy in the humid weather.\n\nit was $6.75 for my bacon <mark><mark><mark>Nacho Cheese</mark> <mark>Polish <mark>Bacon Chili <mark>Polish <mark>Brooklyn Pastrami <mark>Swiss Cheese</mark> Dog</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark>...not really worth it especially when the ones at the original pink's in la cost almost half that. it was topped with bacon, tomato, cheese, and mustard since i didn't want onions on mine. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/uqb9ks7lzesghltmuunmea?select=3fcshb9yqxmpuyvnn8fyxa) the bacon was nice and crispy but the <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> was tiny and wasn't anything special. the ones from costco are way bigger! \n\nmy bun was also flimsy and broke in half after 2 bites. it could have used much more chili and the cheese wasn't melted enough. it was still a tasty meal overall but totally not worth the price tag.",

            "went to pink's on the weekend of oct 2nd.  after drinking on an empty stomach, my two friends and i decided to go to pink's before meeting up with the rest of our friends at a club.  i'm not sure what it is about my group of friends but we like to have a few drinks before an intermission of (greasy but quick) food.  this can either be good or bad when it comes to writing reviews.  \n\nwe were starving and needed food asap.  we actually took a cab to ph for the sole purpose of getting pink's (instead of just eating something in the vicinity of our first spot or the next drinking spot) because after 2 nights of eating at expensive restaurants, clubs, and losing money at the tables - we wanted to eat something noteworthy but cheap.  \n\naccording to my friend who is born/raised socal, it is not as good as the original in cali.  i figured this was a mind-over-matter slash original-is-always-better-duhhh situation.  we ordered the bacon <mark><mark><mark>Nacho Cheese</mark> <mark>Polish <mark>Bacon Chili <mark>Polish <mark>Brooklyn Pastrami <mark>Swiss Cheese</mark> Dog</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark>, fries, and beer.   my other friend (a newyorker) and i thought it was good but agreed it wasn't awesome.  considering the acclamation pink's receives from born and bred la-ers, i changed my assumption and decided it probably is better at the original stand in la.  i remember thinking it wasn't as amazing of an experience as i was hoping to get - and was a bit disappointed by the lack of \"snap\" in <mark>The Showgirl Dog</mark> itself.  also, it was a bit... much.  i have a feeling <mark>The Showgirl Dog</mark> had better snap to it before it got doused in the chili.   \n\nthat being said, i did enjoy my experience there.  it was exactly what i was looking for at that moment.  we were buzzed and looking to eat something extremely unhealthy but tasty - and that's exactly what we got.\n\ni'd definitely try it again because for some reason, i think it was just an off night.  and we had some strange concoction of drinks before going there so all of this might be completely in my head.",

            "never quite had the patience to stand in line in la for this place - tried 2x and gave up before the line even curved towards the front. sorry, but i'll only wait in line for <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark>'s in chicago. we're in vegas, there's a pink's here (right in front of the planet hollywood hotel), there was no line, and i figured it was worth a shot. i had the <mark><mark><mark><mark>Nacho Cheese</mark> <mark>Polish <mark>Bacon Chili <mark>Polish <mark>Brooklyn Pastrami <mark>Swiss Cheese</mark> Dog</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark> - <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> itself was very good - well spiced, no \"weird bits\", and nice snap. the chili tasted fine, but the texture was gluey and kind of unappetizing. i ended up taking most of it off the <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark>. husband had the chicago <mark>Polish <mark>Bacon Chili <mark>Polish <mark>Brooklyn Pastrami <mark>Swiss Cheese</mark> Dog</mark></mark></mark></mark>. great flavor, but the skin was a bit tough. the fries were great though. overall, 3 stars. would come back if in the mood for a <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark>, but not a destination place.", 
            "went to my first pink's of any kind today. heading into the first bite, i definitely did have high expectations, mainly because i was hungry, and also because the prices looked pretty darn high, even after accounting for the recent groupon deal. however, keep in mind that this in in the heart of the las vegas strip, so really you'd almost expect it to be pricey. it's not fair to compare this to costco <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> on price.\n\nwhen i tried my friend's <mark><mark><mark>Nacho Cheese</mark> <mark>Polish <mark>Bacon Chili <mark>Polish <mark>Brooklyn Pastrami <mark>Swiss Cheese</mark> Dog</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark>, my eyes, taste <mark>Bud</mark>, and probably everything else just lit up. yeah, hunger is the best sauce or whatever, but every component of that dog - bun, sausage, chili, and <mark>Grilled Onion</mark> - was really delicious and made me wish that i had chosen it. instead, i had gone with the <mark>Planet Hollywood Dog</mark>, which was also quite tasty with bacon and some sort of enhanced 'shrooms. i also loved the <mark>Plain Polish Sausage</mark>, which is fatter than the normal wiener, and the <mark>Nacho Cheese</mark> went surprisingly well with the rest of the ingredients.\n\nwe also shared some deluxe chili <mark><mark><mark>Deluxe Chili Cheese Fries</mark></mark></mark>, which had a crapload of toppings on them. in hindsight, if i had known how loaded the <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> would be, i would've ordered normal fries for about half the price because my friend was pretty much evacuating his toppings onto the fries. oh well, live and learn.\n\nanyway, i've seen the other reviews, and i'm sure it doesn't match everything that people like about the original pink's - which i still hope to go to some day - but it's still good eating. not considering the price, the only problem i have is that i'd rather go to earl of sandwich, which is right next door and which i love to death, so i might not really see this place much at all in the future. oh well, it was yummy knowing you.", 
            "this should probably be a 3.5 star review - but since you can't do that, and i can't give pink's a 4 star review, i'm going with the 3. i ended up ordering a chili-<mark><mark><mark>Nacho Cheese</mark> <mark>Polish <mark>Bacon Chili <mark>Polish <mark>Brooklyn Pastrami <mark>Swiss Cheese</mark> Dog</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark> and a dog with mustard, sauerkraut and relish. although not the best <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> i've ever had, i do have to say that they were probably the most filled <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> i've ever had. there was almost a bowl full of chili on the chili-<mark><mark><mark>Nacho Cheese</mark> <mark>Polish <mark>Bacon Chili <mark>Polish <mark>Brooklyn Pastrami <mark>Swiss Cheese</mark> Dog</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark>, and a pot full of kraut on the other dog. so if you're hungry, i would definitely go here. i had to eat both of my <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> (didn't finish them..lol..) with a fork and knife - there is that much stuff on them. if you aren't starving, do yourself a favor and order one <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark>. also, if you want to have fries - you can split an order amongst 3 people - they're huge. but, size doesn't always equate to quality, and the quality of <mark>The Showgirl Dog</mark> is just a little lacking (not much though).", 
            "i've always heard about pink's while living in colorado and i actually discovered it by watching the travel channel best eats show. the location in atlanta is the prime location for pink's but the one out here in vegas is on point as well! i had my very first experience 5 days ago and ordered the bacon <mark><mark><mark>Nacho Cheese</mark> <mark>Polish <mark>Bacon Chili <mark>Polish <mark>Brooklyn Pastrami <mark>Swiss Cheese</mark> Dog</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark> and and corona to wash it down. needless to say i smashed it! lol but it was so much food i didn't know where to begin and take my first bite. whatever you do bite high and at an angle or it'll be all over the place. then bite low at an angle on the 2nd bite, and repeat! my new favorite place to get a quick bite :-)", 
            "the variety of toppings you can have on your <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> is pretty amazing (i.e. the different types you can get)....bacon on top, pastrami, etc... weird.... but not too shabby. i wasn't adventurous to try the ones with bacon on them, but adventurous to try a mushroom <mark>Polish <mark>Brooklyn Pastrami <mark>Swiss Cheese</mark> Dog</mark></mark> instead of the <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark>. haha $7 for a mushroom <mark>Polish <mark>Brooklyn Pastrami <mark>Swiss Cheese</mark> Dog</mark></mark> and i thought it was not bad at all. the portion was decent, lots of mayo (which i love) and they did not skimp on the mushrooms. i have to say though, if the mushrooms were grilled, it would've received more stars for me because non-<mark>Grilled Mushroom</mark> just don't taste the same. \n\nhowever, if you just want a quick bite to carry you onto your next activity, this is not a bad stop.", 
            "while playing tourist this weekend, we decided to try pink's <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> and see what the buzz was about (and we had a groupon, so that helped influence the decision).\n\nthe <mark>Chicago <mark>Polish <mark>Brooklyn Pastrami <mark>Swiss Cheese</mark> Dog</mark></mark></mark> was huge.  holy crap, i wasn't really expecting that large of a dog, but i guess that is why they are $7+.\n\neverything was fresh and pretty good.  not super great to make me want to go back immediately, but wouldn't turn it down if someone in town wanted me to stop in with them.", 
            "pink's serves a good dog. but with all the hype i expected more. the toppings are unique and <mark>The Showgirl Dog</mark> are good sized, but at $8/$9 a pop they should be. thanks to groupon, the wife and i have been here twice in the last month. both times we waddled away very content. we had a variety of dogs, <mark>Polish <mark>Bacon Chili <mark>Polish <mark>Brooklyn Pastrami <mark>Swiss Cheese</mark> Dog</mark></mark></mark></mark>, and even a pastrami/<mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> burrito. all very good. the <mark>Onion Ring</mark> are thick and crunchy. i'm a great fan of windy city beefs-n-dogs on lake mead, so i'm not sure if i will be back, but it was fun trying pink's out.", 
            "first off, this is nothing like the pinks in la. i've been living in san diego for a year now, after having lived in la and i miss pinks. so when i was in vegas and saw pinks on the strip i got really excited. as soon as i walked in, i should have known. this place is everything pink and looks like a retro 50's diner. this caught me off guard considering the real pinks is basically a rundown bungalow covered in photographs and the only thing that's actually pink is the sign out front. next was the menu. i didn't recognize a single 'special <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark>'. the original pinks special <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> either have a la themed name or are named after a celebrity. the pinks in las vegas has special dogs named with a las vegas theme. so i had to ask the girl at the front counter if they knew which dogs were renamed and which dog was the martha stewart dog. she had a list behind the counter that listed which special <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> were renamed but she told me that most of their special dogs were not their own creations, not renamed dogs from the original location. uhhhh... ok. so basically this pinks is a completely different restaurant with the name pinks slapped on.\n\nnow for the food. i ordered a <mark><mark><mark>Nacho Cheese</mark> <mark>Polish <mark>Bacon Chili <mark>Polish <mark>Brooklyn Pastrami <mark>Swiss Cheese</mark> Dog</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark> (with a <mark>Plain Polish Sausage</mark> subbed for the <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark>) with mustard and a side of fries, totally $13 and some odd cents. i waited a few minutes and my order number was called. i went to retrieve my food and got really confused as soon as i saw the <mark>French Fries</mark> which are nothing like the la pinks <mark>French Fries</mark>. i made a comment to the person who gave me my food about it looking nothing like food from the original pinks, and a woman, also from la, walked up behind me and said the same. \n\nso was the food good? yeah, it was decent. but not worth the 13 bucks i spent on it. the shoe-string fries were nothing like the cajun fries (that the la pinks serves) i was expecting but the were good nonetheless. worth the $5.99 i paid for them? no. but that's what you get for eating on the strip. the <mark>Plain Polish Sausage</mark> was pretty good and the chili was... not so flavorful. but overall i'm glad i tried it.\n\nthe verdict: if you're on the strip near planet hollywood and craving <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark>, this is probably the best you'll find. however, if you're a lover of the original pinks and have your heart set on your usual order, don't come here. you'll leave with a craving that wasn't curbed, disappointed, and with a wallet that weighs less than when you walked in.", 
            "call me cheap, but without a deal, i would not have come to pink's on my own account, knowing it's hyped, mediocre, and over-priced <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark>. luckily, i used a groupon deal that allowed me to try pink's at an affordable price.\n\nthe stand is located outside the miracle mile shops, with no access from the planet hollywood casino. we learned that the hard way. -_-\n\ni ordered the brooklyn pastrami swiss <mark><mark><mark>Nacho Cheese</mark> <mark>Polish <mark>Bacon Chili <mark>Polish <mark>Brooklyn Pastrami <mark>Swiss Cheese</mark> Dog</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark>. i like keeping my dogs plain, and dressed with mustard. so i enjoyed this dog, but would have liked it even more if the pastrami came out hot, rather than lukewarm.\n\ni also sampled some of the bf's <mark><mark>Poli Bacon Burrito Dog</mark></mark> (2 dogs, bacon, chili, cheese, onions). we ordered <mark>The Showgirl Dog</mark> without onions, but it came out standard, so he brought it back to have it re-made. the cook was nice about it, probably because there was hardly a line at 4 pm, and served up a new one within 3 minutes, spit-free! it was interesting... glad we tried, but wouldn't order it again. it is also best eaten with the wrapper, because the burrito drips chili grease... yum!\n\nwith our $15 groupon, we had to fork out a whopping $0.52. overall, $7.52... i would not mind paying that price, but $15.52 is a bit steep for 2 dogs. i'd rather use that money to buy 2 sammiches from earl's inside. i'll be back once i get my hands on another deal!",

            "i had never been to pink's before, but had a groupon that was running out, and so we ventured out for dinner on a late thursday night to beat the deadline.  no problem, right?  by all appearances, it was just an unremarkable thursday night.  \n\nso off to planet hollywood we went.  but when we pulled up to valet parking behind three stretch limos, and no valet was in sight, something seemed off.  then i saw that we were about six blocks from the valet stand, again with no valet in view.  so, off to self-parking we went, with uniformed police everywhere, to find a parking spot.  at length we found one--the only one.  something unusual was definitely going on.\n\nso, diane and i walked from the parking garage into the miracle mile shops, and walked and walked.  as we finally reached the entrance to planet hollywood on the other side of the shopping promenade, 9 uniformed sheriff's deputies were assembled together, and fashionably suited males and well-dressed females were everywhere.  about then i realized that we had left the groupon in the car.  oh, well (sigh).  i decided that i wasn't going to walk all the way back and return again just to save a mere $5!  so, we continued on and out the main doors until we finally saw pink's facing las vegas boulevard, and examined the vast menu on the wall before making our selections.\n\nthis story does end well.  i really enjoyed my brooklyn pastrami swiss <mark><mark><mark>Nacho Cheese</mark> <mark>Polish <mark>Bacon Chili <mark>Polish <mark>Brooklyn Pastrami <mark>Swiss Cheese</mark> Dog</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark> with pickles, onions, mustard, and sauerkraut added, on a soft old country bun.  it included a generous amount of tender pastrami, and although the <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> was thin, it was long and had a very nice snap to it when one bit into the casing.  beer-battered <mark>Onion Ring</mark> and nicely salted shoestring fries were both good and tasty.  and i liked the mild <mark>Nacho Cheese</mark> sauce for dipping my fries, while diane enjoyed <mark>Mini Corn Dogs</mark>.  to my surprise, one single <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> sufficed to quell my appetite.  and, there were free refills of lemonade and all other available soft drinks.  \n\nthe place is nothing fancy, seating is all outside, and there is only counter service.  but staff members were friendly and helpful.  we had a nice view of the strip before us, but it was a mite cold and windy at 10:47 p.m.  heat lamps were present, but not in service.  hard driving music overhead added to the casual ambiance.  so, we finished our food, walked all the way back to the car, and left the parking lot as we were directed out by at least 6 police officers.  just as we were turning onto tropicana avenue, diane asked the last officer if she knew what was going on at planet hollywood, and was told, \"soul train awards!\"\n\nnow i'm sort of glad that i still have my groupon for pink's, which, as luck would have it, does not really expire for another month.  for, it means that i can return again soon to enjoy another tasty classic dog!",

            "another place that can not live up the hype and days on reputation are numbered. i ordered a brooklyn <mark>Polish <mark>Brooklyn Pastrami <mark>Swiss Cheese</mark> Dog</mark></mark> & an order of <mark>Onion Ring</mark>. it was created very quickly, and presented to me. visually it looked amazing, however once i took a bite & tasted the dry lifeless dog my disappointment set in. the <mark>Onion Ring</mark> were fantastic, maybe i will try it again however my first visit was anything but life changing.",

            "disgusting!!!! \n\nthat's all i can say. i was dying for some pinks in la and happened to run into this location. i ordered the <mark><mark><mark><mark>Nacho Cheese</mark> <mark>Polish <mark>Bacon Chili <mark>Polish <mark>Brooklyn Pastrami <mark>Swiss Cheese</mark> Dog</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark> and the chicago and hoped it tasted the same. boy was i wrong!\n\nthe sausage did not taste the same as the ones in la. i ended up feeling sick after eating it. \n\nlisten to the reviews folks so you don't end up like me with a bad stomach ache."

            "for lunch i wanted to try pink's--finally.  i heard that their <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> were very good and decided to try for myself.  there are a few things to keep in mind when it comes to pink's--size and cost. i'll explain in a minute.\n\njust to let everyone know, pink's it outside of planet hollywood/miracle mile shops facing the boulevard.  i walked around for awhile till i found the sign in the building and realized it was outside.  anyway, there wasn't a line and their seating is all outside, so i went in to take a look at their menu.\n\nthe menu is simple with pre-made options for you and even burgers if you aren't into their dogs. at almost 10 dollars a dog it was pretty pricey, but i expected that from a famous <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> eaterie.  they even have their special dogs from celebrities on a flyer at the entrance and near the menu, so check those out, too.\n\ni went for a <mark>Guadalajara Dog</mark>--<mark>Sour Cream</mark>, tomatoes, onions and relish--and my husband ate their classic <mark><mark><mark><mark>Nacho Cheese</mark> <mark>Polish <mark>Bacon Chili <mark>Polish <mark>Brooklyn Pastrami <mark>Swiss Cheese</mark> Dog</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark> with onions.  we grabbed a water and fountain drink for a total of 25 dollars and moved on down to the pick up area. when i saw our <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> i freaked out.  i love toppings, but really?  really?  this was definitely a fork and knife dog.\n\ni love eating my <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> by hand.  it's just the way that it should be, but at pink's it's difficult to do so.  too many toppings on <mark>The Showgirl Dog</mark> cause the flavor of <mark>The Showgirl Dog</mark> to be lost, so i scraped everything off on one half to get down to what matters--that fried dog.  the <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> is good with a slight snap to it, but it's not an amazing.  i ate the rest with my utensils, feeling as if i violated some ethical <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> code by not eating with my hands.\n\nif you want to try <mark>The Showgirl Dog</mark>, buy a plain one and ask for toppings on the side if you need them, that way you can really taste what a pink's dog is all about.  if you want something really good, their <mark><mark><mark><mark>Nacho Cheese</mark> <mark>Polish <mark>Bacon Chili <mark>Polish <mark>Brooklyn Pastrami <mark>Swiss Cheese</mark> Dog</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark> was decent.\n\noverall <mark>The Showgirl Dog</mark> was decent and i can at least say that i've tried it once. would i fight my way down there through traffic again for it?  nope.  but it's something you have to try once so you can say that you have.",

            "oh pink's, how you have been able to somewhat redeem yourself. going to college in los angeles, you're bound to go to pink's at least once. after having it there, i really thought this place was overrated. the <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> were just ok, and were definitely not worth the wait in line (at least 30 minutes).\n\nbecause of that, i really did not want to give this location a chance. however, we were leaving las vegas and wanted something were it would've be relatively quick. hesitantly, i agreed to go to pink's. and you know what, i'm really glad i did.\n\nfor those that do not know where pink's is, it's outside on the strip. when we got here, i was honestly surprised that there was no line here. i had to initially do a double take to make sure i was at the right location. there were the familiar pictures of celebrities on the wall which helped me know that i was at the right place.\n\ndue to being hungry, i ordered <mark>The Spicy Mojave Dog</mark> and the <mark>Guadalajara Dog</mark>. the <mark>Guadalajara Dog</mark> was good, the mix of <mark>Sour Cream</mark>, tomatoes, and relish was a nice combination with the <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark>. i'm not the biggest fan of relish, but i liked it in this case. <mark>The Spicy Mojave Dog</mark> was pretty awesome. to warn you in advance, make sure you have napkins, a fork, and a knife. i rarely eat <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> with a knife and fork, but in this case, you must! the <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> have a nice pop when you take a bite, which i love in a <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark>.\n\nthere's no room to eat inside, but there are tables outside for you to sit and enjoy the strip on a nice warm day. especially after a big night of partying, this is a nice way to recover. \n\noverall, i'd give it 3.5 stars. the reason i rounded it down to a 3 was due to my experiences at the hollywood location. though i'll definitely would come back to this location whenever i'm in vegas.",

(what? a <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> in a tortilla?? they did it!)\n\ni have to give them three stars based on the following:\n1. i dont usually like <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> but i enjoyed my experience and would def go back\n2. originality in both names, flavors, various types of dogs and condiments",

            "i've been wanting to try this for a while after seeing it on a food network special.  while in vegas, this was my first and last meal.  the first meal was a classic dog with chili, mustard, onions, and tomatoes (possibly cheese too but i can't remember for sure).  the last meal of my trip was a life saver after a very long night out.  i got the <mark>Western Guacamole Burger</mark> (with a scoop of chili on top).  it was a amazing, the chili had great flavor and the <mark>Onion Ring</mark> with guacamole were a nice touch as well.", 
            "was out in vegas for a quick and cheap getaway and  did the casino thing and took plenty of pics but now it was time for lunch after walking the strip and taking in sites.i had a groupon coupon for pinks <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark>. i think it for $15.00 off my purchase and for me it won't take me long .a chillidog,<mark>Onion Ring</mark> and a powerade-large for all the walking.first bite was that snap in <mark>The Showgirl Dog</mark> that reminds me of <mark>The Showgirl Dog</mark> in nyc off the push carts in midtown or on fordham rd in the bronx days,<mark>Onion Ring</mark> were crisp and hot and the powerade well i needed it.sat outside on the patio and watched the people on the strip go by and as they watched me digg into my meal.had a good talk with the staff and you get that loud \"welcome to pinks\" when you enter <mark>The Showgirl Dog</mark>.wish they had one near me..**,", 
            "pink's serves a good dog. but with all the hype i expected more. the toppings are unique and <mark>The Showgirl Dog</mark> are good sized, but at $8/$9 a pop they should be. thanks to groupon, the wife and i have been here twice in the last month. both times we waddled away very content. we had a variety of dogs, <mark>Polish <mark>Bacon Chili <mark>Polish <mark>Brooklyn Pastrami <mark>Swiss Cheese</mark> Dog</mark></mark></mark></mark>, and even a pastrami/<mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> burrito. all very good. the <mark>Onion Ring</mark> are thick and crunchy. i'm a great fan of windy city beefs-n-dogs on lake mead, so i'm not sure if i will be back, but it was fun trying pink's out.", 
            "expensive for just plain old <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark>. upon arriving in vegas on my previous trip, this was my first stop with my friends for lunch. since my friend's mom had made spam musubis for the plane ride, i didn't really have enough room to be too adventurous when i ate here. i ended up just getting a <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> with bbq sauce. however, my one friend got a <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> with bacon and onions while another friend of mine got the bacon burrito. the bacon burrito was not bad, but it was oily. the oil was literally dripping out of the wrapping. i'm not afraid of oil, but for some reason this made me feel kinda gross. although my first experience here at pink's wasn't a bad one, i don't think i will be returning. the price is a little too much (i think it was like $5 for <mark>Onion Ring</mark>? ... uhhh, i'll pass) and the food isn't extremely amazing - i would be more satisfied with a $1.50 costco <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> that comes with a drink.",

            "i had the ph <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> and it was pretty good.  it's loaded w/ bacon, <mark>Grilled Onion</mark>, <mark>Nacho Cheese</mark>, and some mushrooms.  the <mark>Nacho Cheese</mark> kinda masked the taste of the <mark>Plain Polish Sausage</mark>, i think next time i'll get it w/ just a light amount of cheese.  the <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> itself is pretty huge too (to the point it's almost difficult to eat lol).  the price tag is reasonable, at $9 i felt this was a decent deal.\n\nmy <mark>Bud</mark> ordered some weird stuff that had <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> wrapped in tortillas or actual burritos.  i'd pass on this weird stuff as it didn't look good.  if you are coming to pinks then order a <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark>, don't order this weird stuff.  that's like ordering a burger at a taco joint lol. \n\ntip-\n-grab a fat tuesday just in the same shopping plaza of ph!  \n-pass on getting the <mark>Onion Ring</mark> (rating 2/5).  they were so sweet they tasted horrible\n-eating only availabe in the outdoor patio.  so if it's in the middle of the day i probably wouldn't eat here.  just come here for late night eats",

            "i had never been to pink's before, but had a groupon that was running out, and so we ventured out for dinner on a late thursday night to beat the deadline.  no problem, right?  by all appearances, it was just an unremarkable thursday night.  \n\nso off to planet hollywood we went.  but when we pulled up to valet parking behind three stretch limos, and no valet was in sight, something seemed off.  then i saw that we were about six blocks from the valet stand, again with no valet in view.  so, off to self-parking we went, with uniformed police everywhere, to find a parking spot.  at length we found one--the only one.  something unusual was definitely going on.\n\nso, diane and i walked from the parking garage into the miracle mile shops, and walked and walked.  as we finally reached the entrance to planet hollywood on the other side of the shopping promenade, 9 uniformed sheriff's deputies were assembled together, and fashionably suited males and well-dressed females were everywhere.  about then i realized that we had left the groupon in the car.  oh, well (sigh).  i decided that i wasn't going to walk all the way back and return again just to save a mere $5!  so, we continued on and out the main doors until we finally saw pink's facing las vegas boulevard, and examined the vast menu on the wall before making our selections.\n\nthis story does end well.  i really enjoyed my brooklyn pastrami swiss <mark><mark><mark>Nacho Cheese</mark> <mark>Polish <mark>Bacon Chili <mark>Polish <mark>Brooklyn Pastrami <mark>Swiss Cheese</mark> Dog</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark> with pickles, onions, mustard, and sauerkraut added, on a soft old country bun.  it included a generous amount of tender pastrami, and although the <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> was thin, it was long and had a very nice snap to it when one bit into the casing.  beer-battered <mark>Onion Ring</mark> and nicely salted shoestring fries were both good and tasty.  and i liked the mild <mark>Nacho Cheese</mark> sauce for dipping my fries, while diane enjoyed <mark>Mini Corn Dogs</mark>.  to my surprise, one single <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> sufficed to quell my appetite.  and, there were free refills of lemonade and all other available soft drinks.  \n\nthe place is nothing fancy, seating is all outside, and there is only counter service.  but staff members were friendly and helpful.  we had a nice view of the strip before us, but it was a mite cold and windy at 10:47 p.m.  heat lamps were present, but not in service.  hard driving music overhead added to the casual ambiance.  so, we finished our food, walked all the way back to the car, and left the parking lot as we were directed out by at least 6 police officers.  just as we were turning onto tropicana avenue, diane asked the last officer if she knew what was going on at planet hollywood, and was told, \"soul train awards!\"\n\nnow i'm sort of glad that i still have my groupon for pink's, which, as luck would have it, does not really expire for another month.  for, it means that i can return again soon to enjoy another tasty classic dog!",

            "another place that can not live up the hype and days on reputation are numbered. i ordered a brooklyn <mark>Polish <mark>Brooklyn Pastrami <mark>Swiss Cheese</mark> Dog</mark></mark> & an order of <mark>Onion Ring</mark>. it was created very quickly, and presented to me. visually it looked amazing, however once i took a bite & tasted the dry lifeless dog my disappointment set in. the <mark>Onion Ring</mark> were fantastic, maybe i will try it again however my first visit was anything but life changing.", 
            "we were starving and only had 45 min before jeff dunham started so we got <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> and <mark>Onion Ring</mark> and took it back to our room! they were great and the cashier mad a combo to save us money without us asking. i like that! they have a hard frozen lemonade there that was the best frozen drink i had in vegas. we got the showgirl (no relish) and <mark>The Spicy Mojave Dog</mark>. we ate the whole thing. we will be back next time we are in vegas and will absolutely  get my frozen drink there instead of the other syrupy sweet places.", 
            "ever since seeing the original pink's highlighted on a food channel travelogue, i've always wanted to give this a whirl. since central la isn't high on my list of visited places, i'll settle for a branch office.\n\nthe \"snap\" of <mark>The Showgirl Dog</mark> was just amazing! i had mine with mustard, onions, and kraut. that's how i like it, and i liked it. i asked the counter staff whether i should get fries or <mark>Onion Ring</mark>. they said, \"how about half and half?\" nice touch. after trying both, i would have opted for all rings. very good.", 
            "this was another cheap place to have lunch and it was close to the hotel (planet hollywood) which we where staying at while in vegas. they had a number interesting <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark>. we decided to get the <mark>Vegas Strip Dog</mark> which was awesome and the and the ruben dog which was really good and a order of <mark>Onion Ring</mark> which you can't go wrong with. this place was a nice little find and the service was fast. \n\nseating was restricted to outside only which was ok they did have the heat warmers which made it better the only down fall was there was a lot of birds that where always around but they weren't to bad. it was a nice place to have a quick cheap lunch and just enjoy some people watching. i really don't think you could find a bad dog on the menu as it was a pretty large menu! i will definitely be back!"

            "nom! i love pinks! especially their spicy sausages, they are extremely flavorful and are happily spicy.\n\nbut one of the main reasons why i love pinks is because of its location, it is located right outside of miracle mile so you can enjoy a one mile stroll and work up an appetite before you gorge yourself on <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> and sausages. but make sure you take an extra stroll at the forum shops before hand so you can enjoy the delectable chilli <mark><mark><mark>Deluxe Chili Cheese Fries</mark></mark></mark>. they are super yummy, and if you get in a decent work out during your shopping run you won't even feel that guilty about it.",

            "something isn't the same with pink's here vs la, i know the names are different - i stood there searching for my martha steward dog.  anyway, ordered the show girl and chili <mark><mark><mark>Deluxe Chili Cheese Fries</mark></mark></mark>.  fries were really good but my show girl wasn't the same as la... maybe it's the waiting in line for over an hour and it just tastes better because you earned it...hmmm well 3 stars because there's barely anywhere to eat your dog, the outside patio has a couple of tables and then you kinda just look like a bum", 
            "pink's is located near ph towers so i was finally able to see what the hype was all about!!! it's really small inside, there's no seating area inside, but they have a small patio, so if you come here on a cold/windy night like i did, i'd suggest to take your food to go!\n\nsince it was my first time, i asked the girl working there what she'd recommend! she recommended the <mark>Polish <mark>Bacon Chili <mark>Polish <mark>Brooklyn Pastrami <mark>Swiss Cheese</mark> Dog</mark></mark></mark></mark>, which was definitely one of my favorite! it was huge! the bacon <mark><mark><mark>Nacho Cheese</mark> <mark>Polish <mark>Bacon Chili <mark>Polish <mark>Brooklyn Pastrami <mark>Swiss Cheese</mark> Dog</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark> was also good! i was starving after an hour and a  half of walking the strip and going in and out of casinos, so i was able to finish my <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> with some chili <mark><mark><mark>Deluxe Chili Cheese Fries</mark></mark></mark>!!! the chili <mark><mark><mark>Deluxe Chili Cheese Fries</mark></mark></mark> will cost you a little over five dollars! but one order is a lot!", 
            "the food here is served in huge portions. it's also good, but greasy. the <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> taste really good and the chili <mark><mark><mark>Deluxe Chili Cheese Fries</mark></mark></mark> are good because of the cheese sauce used instead of shredded cheese. it's a good place to eat if you're on the strip and want something not pretentious. it's all normal fast food with huge portions and tastes good.", 
            "really excited to finally try pink's <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark>, certainly a visit i'll never forget. i can't even remember which dogs we ordered but it was all just ok not as great as i thought it would be. my dog consisted of two dogs with guacamole, <mark>Nacho Cheese</mark>, and onions. my fiance's was jalapenos, <mark>Nacho Cheese</mark>, guac, and tomato,  threw in some chili <mark><mark><mark>Deluxe Chili Cheese Fries</mark></mark></mark> too. i also ordered an alcoholic drink lemonade slushy but it was just filling and not strong at all. so the reason i will never forget this place is because we stopped here before we made our way back home to riverside. as soon as we hit the road my tummy started growling and hurting alot. we reached a rest stop on the 15 fwy and i ran as fast as i could and then all hell broke loose! i'd never experienced anything like it. i felt so weak after and we had such a long way to go, do you know how scary it was to drive for hours and not know when the next restroom stop would come. we bought lots of pepto bismol and thankfully no accidents occurred lol. i know this story is really embarrassing but i just want to warn others , stock up on some pepto and if you do eat here don't do it before a 4 hour drive home hahaha.", 
            "after exploring the strip thus far, i noticed a familiar la sign..but in the middle of the strip in vegas at planet hollywood..no way! unlike the la location this place was not so crowded. i knew i had to verify if this was the real deal pinks or not. no way better to test my curiosity than to grab my favorite pinks items, the <mark><mark><mark>Nacho Cheese</mark> <mark>Polish <mark>Bacon Chili <mark>Polish <mark>Brooklyn Pastrami <mark>Swiss Cheese</mark> Dog</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark> and chili <mark><mark><mark>Deluxe Chili Cheese Fries</mark></mark></mark>. as i was placing my order, i noticed the menu was somewhat different. when i got my food, it looked as delicious as the original in la, but definitely did not taste the same. needless to say of course the hollywood theme hotel would want one of la's famous eateries in their establishment. though it is flattering to bestow such honor upon pinks, the quality of the classic pinks was not there. it is cool to see this out in vegas and they serve alcohol and collectible pinks cups, but it just isn't the same.",

            "went to my first pink's of any kind today. heading into the first bite, i definitely did have high expectations, mainly because i was hungry, and also because the prices looked pretty darn high, even after accounting for the recent groupon deal. however, keep in mind that this in in the heart of the las vegas strip, so really you'd almost expect it to be pricey. it's not fair to compare this to costco <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> on price.\n\nwhen i tried my friend's <mark><mark><mark>Nacho Cheese</mark> <mark>Polish <mark>Bacon Chili <mark>Polish <mark>Brooklyn Pastrami <mark>Swiss Cheese</mark> Dog</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark>, my eyes, taste <mark>Bud</mark>, and probably everything else just lit up. yeah, hunger is the best sauce or whatever, but every component of that dog - bun, sausage, chili, and <mark>Grilled Onion</mark> - was really delicious and made me wish that i had chosen it. instead, i had gone with the <mark>Planet Hollywood Dog</mark>, which was also quite tasty with bacon and some sort of enhanced 'shrooms. i also loved the <mark>Plain Polish Sausage</mark>, which is fatter than the normal wiener, and the <mark>Nacho Cheese</mark> went surprisingly well with the rest of the ingredients.\n\nwe also shared some deluxe chili <mark><mark><mark>Deluxe Chili Cheese Fries</mark></mark></mark>, which had a crapload of toppings on them. in hindsight, if i had known how loaded the <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> would be, i would've ordered normal fries for about half the price because my friend was pretty much evacuating his toppings onto the fries. oh well, live and learn.\n\nanyway, i've seen the other reviews, and i'm sure it doesn't match everything that people like about the original pink's - which i still hope to go to some day - but it's still good eating. not considering the price, the only problem i have is that i'd rather go to earl of sandwich, which is right next door and which i love to death, so i might not really see this place much at all in the future. oh well, it was yummy knowing you.",

            "skip <mark>The Showgirl Dog</mark>! they're horrible! i mean, terrible! the chili was definitely delicious, so if you're really stuck on going here, grab the chili <mark><mark><mark>Deluxe Chili Cheese Fries</mark></mark></mark> and please save yourself the money and skip <mark>The Showgirl Dog</mark>. i've never been so adamant on telling someone to skip something as i am about this! the bun was stale, <mark>The Showgirl Dog</mark> itself was bad- it had that pop when you take your first bite, and though i know that is the goal of some places that serve dogs, i know that's not the goal for pinks and i'm pretty sure it poped because it was way overly old and over cooked. i'm sad to have to give a place with such a great reputation in la such a bad review, but clearly they sold themselves out when coming to vegas and just got dollar signs in their eyes without making sure the quality followed with them. i seriously have had much better <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> at the movie theater. i couldn't even finish my over-priced <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> because it was that bad. i know i sound like a snob, but i'm not, i promise. i was hungry after having a long day of walking and beers and all i wanted was a delicious juicy <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> and this was very disappointing. i keep going on but it was that bad. good luck to you if you ignore this and still get a dog, i pray i just caught them on a really really off and bad day, but from what i understand, i'm not too far off from what others were saying.sorry friends!",

            "i came here for dinner last saturday before watching a movie at the regal on the other side of the casino.  i'm from la and have been to the original pinks, so my initial feelings were a bit mixed, but i decided to give a go.    \n\nwe had about an hour before our movie started so we figured we had plenty of time to enjoy our meal.  a nice bonus of this location was that we were able to sit around the edge of the restaurant and watch college football in the sports betting area.  i was hoping that my rival college team would lose, but i guess that is what i get for wishing ill on a team...even my rivals.\n\nif there were half stars i would have given pink's 3.5, but i rounded down for a couple reasons.  one of reasons was that the speed of service left a bit to be desired.  it was a pretty busy saturday night and they only had two people working (one in the kitchen and one at the register) so service was slow.  there was a part of me that thought the menu items were a little over priced...but i rounded down more for the slow service\n\nnow to the important part, the food:\n\nthe las vegas <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> - came with cheese, chili, jalapenos, guacamole and two <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark>.  this was definitely the better of the two dogs we tried.  it was a little less than $7.  really though how can you not like chill and cheese on a <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark>...everything else was just a bonus.\n\nthe spicy mojave (with sauerkraut) - the extra sauerkraut definitely saved this <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark>.  it just didn't seem like much without it, especially for almost $7.  \n\nchili <mark><mark><mark>Deluxe Chili Cheese Fries</mark></mark></mark> - i think this was the highlight of the meal.  there was a great portion of chili and cheese.  and the fries were perfect.  they were a little thicker on than a pencil, crispy outside soft inside.\n\nif you are looking for some comfort fast food while watching a game...or many games at once...this could be a fun spot for you to hit.",

            "i go every time i go for a trek up and down the strip and will continue to do so.\n\nthe reason i'm only giving three stars is that although the service is good, and the place is clean, and <mark>The Showgirl Dog</mark> aren't bad, they're not all that great either.  mainly i like the place for the variety.\n\n<mark>The Showgirl Dog</mark> by itself can't hold up to a properly done nathans, but it's nowhere near as bad as a bar s.\n\nthe rueben dog is good, but the <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> itself gets lost in the reuben part, which isn't bad, but i'd like to taste <mark>The Showgirl Dog</mark> if it's there.\n\nnow, what makes pinks (la anyways) famous is the <mark><mark><mark><mark>Nacho Cheese</mark> <mark>Polish <mark>Bacon Chili <mark>Polish <mark>Brooklyn Pastrami <mark>Swiss Cheese</mark> Dog</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark>.  i recently had the bacon chili <mark><mark>Poli Bacon Burrito Dog</mark></mark>.  the bacon was nice if undercooked, but that's about it.  the cheese and onions got lost in the chili which was pretty dang boring.  it's not spicy, it's not flavourful.  it tastes kind of like bean powder was mixed with ground beef, gravy, and a dash of tabasco.  not anything special.\n\nif a place is famous for something, it should be good, that's why they're famous.  so it was very disappointing to discover it tastes like something out of a <mark>Bud</mark> can.", 
            "dude, it's pink's...in vegas. my two favorite things in the world. ok, i really don't feel that way. but if i was a surfer dude from redondo beach out with my <mark>Bud</mark> for a vegas weekend, this would certainly be my dining destination of choice. since i'm not, i guess i can be a little more discriminating. but dude, it's pink's. well not quite pink's. just a reasonable facsimile in an apt setting, planet hollywood. \n\njamie w. and i really wanted some dogs after strolling through the sterile city center complex which has none of the kitsch that really is vegas. luckily, pink's has kitsch to spare in its patio setting outside the hotel entrance. the menu looked familiar. we decided to each get a $4.75 giant 12-inch jalapeno dog with <mark>Nacho Cheese</mark> and chili, and share a $6.50 \"planet hollywood\" dog, which consisted of a <mark>Plain Polish Sausage</mark>, <mark>Grilled Onion</mark>, <mark>Grilled Mushroom</mark>, bacon and cheese (see photos). oh did i mention the fries, too? nice and tasty they were. \n\nindigestion thy name is pink's. the jalapeno dog has that snap to the wiener that i don't care for much. i prefer a meatier dog to the tooth, and the mustard was way overwhelming, but chili, cheese and diced onions are bulletproof on a dog as far as i'm concerned. the \"planet hollywood\" dog has quite a pile of toppings to maneuver in your mouth starting with the bacon strips lording over the sausage already drowning in melted cheese. the mushrooms seemed almost incidental to the creation, but they were good. hell, it was all good in a bad, bad way. \n\nfood - 3 stars....quite an abundance of toppings on those dogs but not quite the pink's i remember in la \nambiance - 2 stars...hell, it's just a patio...in pink \nservice - 2.5 stars...just keep moving the line and <mark>The Showgirl Dog</mark> will eventually be there \ntotal - 3 stars...a middling experience based on a distant memory of the pink's in la", 
            "it's like comparing <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> and hamburgers!!! i lived in so-cal for a while and was lucky enough to be dating a young lady who went to school off of lebrea and sunset and just down the street was pinks. \" the real pinks\"  you would wait in line for an hour to get a dog but it was worth it. this sad rendition of pinks let me down.\n\na good dog is hard to find no matter where you look. since i lucky enough to have the original maybe it is just a bias opinion, but when you say light mustard on a dog and it tastes like <mark>The Showgirl Dog</mark> is stuffed with mustard it just does not fly with me.   maybe it has a lot to do with the fact that i waited in line for about the same amount of time i did in sunny california and i was expecting the same amazing culinary experience.... can i call a <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> a culinary experience?\n\nthis is turning into a rant of sorts, so i am calling this review... the food was not good, not worth the price, and not worth the experience, so in this case there is no saving grace for this pinks in my eye!! \n\ni guess if you have a craving for a dog and there is no sams club near by this might be an option.. enjoy at your own risk, and apologize to your taste <mark>Bud</mark> ahead of time.", 
            "if you are hungry in vegas, and are trying to eat on a <mark>Bud</mark>, go here. it is right by he planet hollywood miracle mile shops entry on the strip, and also conveniently located next to another great place earl of sandwich.", 
            "went to my first pink's of any kind today. heading into the first bite, i definitely did have high expectations, mainly because i was hungry, and also because the prices looked pretty darn high, even after accounting for the recent groupon deal. however, keep in mind that this in in the heart of the las vegas strip, so really you'd almost expect it to be pricey. it's not fair to compare this to costco <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> on price.\n\nwhen i tried my friend's <mark><mark><mark>Nacho Cheese</mark> <mark>Polish <mark>Bacon Chili <mark>Polish <mark>Brooklyn Pastrami <mark>Swiss Cheese</mark> Dog</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark>, my eyes, taste <mark>Bud</mark>, and probably everything else just lit up. yeah, hunger is the best sauce or whatever, but every component of that dog - bun, sausage, chili, and <mark>Grilled Onion</mark> - was really delicious and made me wish that i had chosen it. instead, i had gone with the <mark>Planet Hollywood Dog</mark>, which was also quite tasty with bacon and some sort of enhanced 'shrooms. i also loved the <mark>Plain Polish Sausage</mark>, which is fatter than the normal wiener, and the <mark>Nacho Cheese</mark> went surprisingly well with the rest of the ingredients.\n\nwe also shared some deluxe chili <mark><mark><mark>Deluxe Chili Cheese Fries</mark></mark></mark>, which had a crapload of toppings on them. in hindsight, if i had known how loaded the <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> would be, i would've ordered normal fries for about half the price because my friend was pretty much evacuating his toppings onto the fries. oh well, live and learn.\n\nanyway, i've seen the other reviews, and i'm sure it doesn't match everything that people like about the original pink's - which i still hope to go to some day - but it's still good eating. not considering the price, the only problem i have is that i'd rather go to earl of sandwich, which is right next door and which i love to death, so i might not really see this place much at all in the future. oh well, it was yummy knowing you.", 
            "i had the ph <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> and it was pretty good.  it's loaded w/ bacon, <mark>Grilled Onion</mark>, <mark>Nacho Cheese</mark>, and some mushrooms.  the <mark>Nacho Cheese</mark> kinda masked the taste of the <mark>Plain Polish Sausage</mark>, i think next time i'll get it w/ just a light amount of cheese.  the <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> itself is pretty huge too (to the point it's almost difficult to eat lol).  the price tag is reasonable, at $9 i felt this was a decent deal.\n\nmy <mark>Bud</mark> ordered some weird stuff that had <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> wrapped in tortillas or actual burritos.  i'd pass on this weird stuff as it didn't look good.  if you are coming to pinks then order a <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark>, don't order this weird stuff.  that's like ordering a burger at a taco joint lol. \n\ntip-\n-grab a fat tuesday just in the same shopping plaza of ph!  \n-pass on getting the <mark>Onion Ring</mark> (rating 2/5).  they were so sweet they tasted horrible\n-eating only availabe in the outdoor patio.  so if it's in the middle of the day i probably wouldn't eat here.  just come here for late night eats", 
            "so we went there to soak up some alcohol like everyone else on a friday night after a hard night of clubbing. the service was prompt and the food hot. hense the 2 stars. \n\nhowever it is worth noting that as a chicagoan i have high expectations for <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> (and pizza of course). so when i walk in and saw chicago style <mark>Plain Hot Dog</mark> on the menu i got psyched! wrong!\n\nmy friend pointed out that it actually said \"chicago style polish.\" now if you're from the chi you know our polishes are called \"maxwell street polishes\" and if you're a lil older you may even know them as \"jew town polishes\" but not chicago style. but whatever. so my <mark>Bud</mark> orders one for shits and giggles. ugh!\n\nhe gets the thing and it's got lettuce, tomato, and relish (not even neon green). the eff? no celery salt? no peppers? no mustard? no <mark>Grilled Onion</mark>? blasphemy! \n\nmy polish was underwhelming too. i got grilled oinions and mustard on mine. it's worth noting however that the onions were chopped not grilled in slices. gross! \n\nso does pinks do the job? yes. would i go back when i go to vegas? sure i guess. but please for the love of beans take chicago off you menu if you can't get it right. k? thanks!"
