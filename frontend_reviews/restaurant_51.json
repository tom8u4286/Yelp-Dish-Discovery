            "an all-inclusive place to hang out, eat, drink, and watch the latest sports on their multiple tvs!  with it being vegas, no dress code or cover charge means it will be very popular!\n\nwalking in on a saturday night, expect a wait of at least an hour because that's how long we waited for our party of four.  call ahead to get yourself on the list since they don't take reservations for parties less than 10!  if you're lucky, you can squeeze yourself over by the bar and try one of their 100 to 250 beers on tap.  they say they do offer the \"world's largest selection of draft beer.\"  you can order it by the pint or half yard, but watch out if you break the half yard glass; it'll cost you an extra $10!  but if you want a sampling, request their six-pack.  it's a weekly rotating variety of six different beers so you can get a taste of each.\n\nthe best seats are in the booths, which can fit five comfortably.  the tables in the middle are for the big parties, but you're constantly being bumped into as people and staff attempt to squeeze on by.\n\nwe went for a variety of appetizers to share:\n\n* grilled jamaican wings: \"tossed in jerk spices with rum bbq sauce\" $10.25 - a generous amount of wings, but not enough of that sauce.  full of flavor though and tasty!\n\n* firecracker wings: \"tossed in a spicy sesame garlic plum glaze\" $10.25 - favored over the jamaican wings because of the spice kicker.\n\n* grilled hearts of romaine: \"topped with red onions, candied walnuts and a gorgonzola champagne vinaigrette\" $8.95 - good enough to share with really nice walnuts and yummy dressing.  even the guys in our group were fighting over it!\n\n* baby leaf spinach: \"portabella mushrooms, red onions, smoked gouda, tomatoes, croutons, and balsamic vinaigrette\" $7.95 - not enough portabella mushrooms, but i like the gouda.\n\n* lobster, crab & <mark>Lobster, Crab & Artichoke Dip</mark>: \"main lobster, blue crab and artichoke hearts baked with a <mark>Four Cheese</mark> blend served with tortilla chips and grilled flat bread\" $11.45 - good dip, but not the most popular dish we ordered.\n\n* barnaise sliders: \"four mini burgers made from naturewell natural angus beef served with fried onions, barnaise sauce, fries and pickle $9.95 - the fried onions make it taste really good, although the side of barnaise sauce sure doesn't hurt.  even the thin fries taste good!\n\n* <mark>Classic Sliders</mark>: \"four mini burgers made from naturewell natural angus beef served with cheddar cheese, our house special sauce, fries and pickle\" $9.95 - only okay after you try the barnaise ones, stick to that one instead.  \n\n* fresh baked brownie: \"topped with mint chocolate chip, caramel or vanilla ice cream\" $7.95 - takes about fifteen minutes and meant for sharing.\n\n* draft beer float: \"lindeman's framboise with vanilla ice cream\" $6.50 - like a root beer float, but with lindeman's.\n\nthey do offer regular entrees like sandwiches, steaks, burgers, chicken, pizza, and seafood.  there's bound to be something on the menu for everyone, which makes this place a good choice.  the noise level is over the top though and you'll find yourself screaming to be heard.  (not exactly the best place for a date if you're sitting across from each other.  but a good place to check out people and possibly make some new friends.  we ran into quite a few people we knew that saturday night, so it's definitely a hopping place!)\n\nsince i'm still not a beer drinker, i like the yard house because they serve up lindeman's ($8, in a goblet) and wyder's.  i can drink something i enjoy while everyone else is having their rounds of beer.\n\nthey do offer happy hours: monday through friday, 3 pm to 6 pm; sunday through wednesday, 11 pm to close. select appetizers are half-priced and drinks are discounted.  after 11 pm on friday and saturday nights, it's 21 years and older.  the crowd does change a bit and the skirts become shorter.  there's even a line outside by then, so come in earlier and get yourself acquainted at the bar.\n\nthis place is kid-friendly since they do offer a kids' menu and their \"kids klub.\"  but you probably don't want to take them here on weekend nights.\n\nupdate! 05/31/08 - this time tried their (mac & cheese)2 \"roasted <mark>Southern Fried Chicken Breast</mark>, applewood bacon, wild mushrooms, cheddar and parmesan cheese with castellane pasta and white truffle oil.\"  next time, i'm going to skip the chicken because it's dried out.  but so yummy though when you get past the poultry part.", 
            "our daughter, who lives in vegas and comes here frequently, took us here for lunch on nfl championship game sunday. it was crowded, but not packed, which was nice since we got a late start. the hostess said 20-30 mins and we were seated in 10. there are plasma tvs everywhere here, so i can't imagine there being a bad seat in the house to watch a game. \n\nif i were designing the perfect sports bar (for me at least), this place would be the model. start with the beer. the selection is impressive. you can take a beer tour of the world without leaving your seat. if you aren't sure where to start, do the 6 pack taster. \n\nthe food?  i think the hardest part about ordering is picking something. all of the appetizers looked delicious. we had the lobster, crab and <mark>Lobster, Crab & Artichoke Dip</mark>. excellent choice!  e, who is a salad connoisseur, had the walnut pear salad.  r had the sliders.  both were excellent!  i had the bbq bacon and cheese burger.  that burger is now on my \"top 5 burgers i've ever had\" list.  the meat was full of flavor and juicy and the rum bbq sauce had a nice tang to it.\n\nthe atmosphere?  nice and clean inside, with an upscale feeling to it.  the clientele was a good age mix, attractive and dressed like they actually cared about their appearance.\n\nlast but definitely not least, the service.  our server was great.  i think her name was cyndi.  she was attentive without being intrusive and best of all, when it comes to us at least, she was patient.\n\nthe bottom line?  i wish they would seriously consider a location in northern california.  might i suggest the streets of brentwood shopping center?  this is definitely in our rotation of vegas places to go when we're there.", 
            "i decided to wait for mi amigas at the bar, so i waited...waited...and waited for the bartender to acknowledge me...and it wasn't even busy!  after a good 10 minutes, i finally got my drink and, at the same time, mi amigas showed up ready to eat.  as crowds started to pile in for dinner, my very bright red disco-light pager thing went off. we were seated in one of their very long booths, that can take forever to get out of if you're sitting by the wall.  we had the pleasure of having a waiter who was training a newbie (shadowing).  it's cool to train new staff, but it seemed like our \"veteran\" waiter had difficulty multi-tasking with serving, remembering small stuff, and training.  other waiters were gracious enough to help out.  \n \nthe large selection of beers, happy hour, and the fact that it's located in the new town square mall, away from casinos, inspires me to come back.  my new favorites at yh are the mouth-freakin-watering ahi dishes (<mark>Ahi Crunchy </mark> salad and seared <mark>Ahi Sashimi </mark> appetizer), <mark>Lettuce Wraps</mark>, and the lobster-crab-<mark>Lobster, Crab & Artichoke Dip</mark>.  mi amiga's grilled <mark>Rib Eye</mark> steak was not cooked to her specs, so she returned it.  next thing you know, the general manager personally serves her a new <mark>Rib Eye</mark> steak done right...on the house.  now that's the way to do it!", 
            "awesome happy hour!\n\nour party of four took a short cab ride from the strip to check out their happy hour and were not disappointed. they had a great selection of beer and all of the half price apps we got (chinese <mark>Chicken <mark>Shiitake <mark>Lobster Garlic Noodles</mark></mark></mark>, <mark>Lobster, Crab & Artichoke Dip</mark>, buffalo wings, nachos, pizza) were both large in size and and very tasty. our server was friendly and fast! we will be back here for happy hour again on our next vegas trip :)", 
            "awesome place. has a ton of beers on tap and a pretty big menu. never been there before, i asked one of my buddies what was good and he pointed to the <mark>Spicy Jambalaya</mark>. i decided to give it a whirl.\n\nwe started with the crab/<mark>Lobster, Crab & Artichoke Dip</mark> which was pretty good, a bit salty though. the onion rings on the tower were very nice. fried perfectly and great dipping sauce.\n\njambalaya was pretty spicy.  you have your choice of pasta, jasmine rice or brown rice. comes with peppers, sausage, crawfish, and some giant grilled prawns. i stuck with the pasta. it was tasty. of like big brewery chains like bjs and gordon biersch, this one is probably the best of the pack.", 
            "i kept hearing about this place, so i was happy when me and one of my girls decided to come for a girls night out. we had a couple of cocktails each, and 2 appetizers. the drinks were surprisingly good! even though i love beer, i just wasn't in the mood. we ordered the lobster/crab/<mark>Lobster, Crab & Artichoke Dip</mark> and the <mark>Spicy Tuna Roll</mark> (which is not your typical cut roll. it's delicious art). they are must orders. we ate every bite. they service was pretty good at the bar, but that's because we went on a slow night. i will come back again and i need to have some of those beers. then i can give it 5 stars, maybe :-)", 
            "had lunch at the yard house today , sunday football season fairly busy. ordered the crab, lobster and <mark>Lobster, Crab & Artichoke Dip</mark> . lots of crab meat and crab flavor, nice chunks of lobster, can't really taste the lobster because the crab was over powering . maybe they should omit lobster and give a bigger portion or charge less. i'm guessing maybe 5oz portion of dip, comes w flat bread and chips. onion rings served red robin style on a metal peg. i like these better then rr looked like made in house w/ a beer batter, and dusted w/ parm cheese. if this is the batter they use for there fish and chips , nice. i had the crab cake hoagie bread was toasted nicely , it came with two <mark>Blue Crab Cakes</mark> about 2 -3oz ea. bacon,tom  lett and onion. i could only eat half i didn't care for the cajun aioli it came with, but that's not yh fault my own personal taste, next time i know to get tartar sauce. fries was shoe string very good. wife had the mac and cheese , with  chix , mushroom and bacon , i had a little taste . no big deal she liked it,i'm sure she'll write her review. menu reminds me of claim jumper , something for everyone's taste . i would eat here again .", 
            "this place had the looks, there were big screens every where, football on and i didn't see a bad seat in the house for watching the game. \n\nwhen i go out for food, i am usually with my partner, he being a big foodie, loves to make suggestions for what we'll try. sometimes, he's spot on and sometimes he misses the mark. \n\ni chose to start with a beer, after all they make their own, and well, it just sounded right. my selection would be a house honey blonde ale. it was good and cold, smooth tasting with a lightly flavorable sweetness to it. (definitely the best thing i would have and recommend.) i would go back for it in a minute. the rest of my meal was not so great. \n\nwe started out with two apps. the towering ring of onions, which was a tall stack of beer battered rings dusted lightly with some parmesan cheese. there was two dipping sauces, the standard ranch and the chipotle severed in tiny cups too small to dip a full size ring in. the batter was good, but nothing special. it was just onion rings. \n\nthe second app was lobster, crab, <mark>Lobster, Crab & Artichoke Dip</mark>. it had maine lobster, blue crab, artichoke hearts, four blended cheeses and came with chips and flat bread. it was sprinkled with bread crumbs on top and lightly toasted, so it had a little bit of crunch. it was actually better than i expected. \n\nthe main entree' was the (mac + cheese)2. it was roasted chicken with applewood bacon, wild mushrooms, cheddar, parmesan, camponella pasta and truffle oil. i don't know if it was the truffle oil, or the oil from the cheeses but it was oily! the overall texture was nice when you got a bite of the chicken, the wild mushroom and the pasta altogether, but each individual bite was just weak! i didn't care for it that much. i took most of it home. \n\nmy partner tried a crab cake sandwich and fries. i took one bite and wasn't that impressed, at least the fries were crisp. would i go back? yes, only to try more of their beers, perhaps the lobster, crab, <mark>Lobster, Crab & Artichoke Dip</mark> but not sure if i would try anything else.", 
            "yardhouse is renowned for the selection of beer they have. to my shock and excitement, my favorite german beer (which just so happens to be warsteiners!) is featured here for only $4.50! the beers here are magnificently cheap, depending on which you order of course, but its definitely in an affordable range. if you're looking for an adventure to venture away from the general beers of bud light and corona, they have a variety of different beers from different countries... on tap. yes, you heard me right. on tap. \n\ni only tried the ahi and the flatbread with <mark>Lobster, Crab & Artichoke Dip</mark>, which wasn't that bad (flatbread and artichoke is beginning to be a little more redundant for an appetizer meal nowadays, but the ahi was seasoned and seared deliciously!) it was only a wednesday night and the bar was crowded and lively. this is definitely my place in town to where i want to go for beer that's from different countries and you don't need to feel like you're getting ripped off like you would at other places on the strip.", 
            "yard house has been one of my favorite hang out spots with friends for the longest time. it's at town square and right by unlv, perfect place to go to during happy hour with the amount of draft beers they have!!\n\nthe restaurant is huge inside with outdoor seating!! i like sitting outside during fall/spring time frame and definitely indoors during winter and summer. it's a laid back chill environment that's good for everyone. the ambient lighting is good for that kind of romantic feeling if you want it to be, but also just to relax and chill. \n\ni'm here for happy hour with a bunch of friends usually, we used to frequent this place at least once a week, now not so much as we're getting tired of the same ol' thing, lol. \n\ni like trying something different every time i come here as far as the draft beer goes. i've tried almost everything and found some of my favorite types through doing this! just gotta keep an open mind and be willing to try something new in order for this to work out! amber ales have been my favorites, followed by stouts, and then lagers, but i've also been spoiled by what's on tap and now i stay away from bottled beer as much as possible! it really does taste different.\n\nwith my friends and i, we usually just stick around to what's on the appetizer menu, because they're half off during happy hour. some of our favorites include the <mark>Chicken Nachos</mark>, chicken tenders, seared <mark>Ahi Sashimi </mark>, sliders, spinach <mark>Lobster, Crab & Artichoke Dip</mark>, and pizza. you'll almost always see these items on our table from the happy hour menu. other items we usually end up ordering are the <mark>Truffle Fries</mark> and the mac & cheese. the portions are decent for the appetizers and good for sharing, especially the <mark>Chicken Nachos</mark>. \n\nit's good for just all around hang out with a bunch of friends to just relax and catch up. i don't usually do large groups at other places, but here it's fine, because it does get pretty loud.",

            "food was really good and even the half portions were large enough to satisfy 2 hungry full-grown american men. i enjoy having my awesome nephew visiting me, and we ate well. the lobster, crab & <mark>Lobster, Crab & Artichoke Dip</mark> was superb (maybe a little more dip). the cheese & bread fuzed together in my <mark><mark>French Onion</mark> Soup</mark>, so this was the only soup i ever needed a knife for.", 
            "yardhouse's  customer service is on point. they had messed up my order and the manager kindly went up to my table and apologized. the food was great as always! we started with the lobster <mark>Lobster, Crab & Artichoke Dip</mark>. there were way too many chips and pitts for a small dip size. the dip was tasty. we had the macaroni and cheese with <mark>Gardein Orange Peel Chicken</mark> with truffle sauce so yummy! my favorite! \n\nour only disappointment was that my bf's burger didn't have a bearnaise sauce.  and on the menu it says bernaise burger. it was just a reg burger he got. he was hungry so he just ate it. we didn't even tell our waiter.",

            "fun place to go for drinks and good times with friends!  i agree that the happy hour from 3-6 pm is definitely pretty sweet.  can't go wrong with 1/2 on appetizers and drinks.  for appetizers, we tried the onion rings, <mark><mark>California Roll</mark></mark>, <mark><mark>Gardein Fried Chicken Strips</mark></mark>, <mark>Fried Calamari</mark>, <mark>Spicy Tuna Roll</mark>, and <mark>Blue Crab Cakes</mark>.  onion rings, <mark>Fried Calamari</mark>, and <mark>Blue Crab Cakes</mark> were all nice & crispy.  <mark><mark>Gardein Fried Chicken Strips</mark></mark> came with fries and were good as well, but nothing out of the ordinary.  the <mark><mark>California Roll</mark></mark> and <mark>Spicy Tuna Roll</mark> were interesting, in that their presentation was unlike that of those you see in a sushi restaurant.  they actually came as one huge, cut sushi piece, kind of like a cake or a tart.  the presentation was pretty unique, but the taste was also good but nothing really special.  if i was really craving sushi, i'd probably go check out normal sushi places like osaka, sushi club, or something along those lines.  for drinks, i've tried the mangolicious martini, the malibu peach martini, blue moon beer, and wyder's raspberry cider.  i'm usually not a huge beer drinker, but the wyder's was good...nice raspberry taste! of course, looove the martinis!  and to top it all off, we all shared a kona coffee ice cream sundae, which was to die for!!! i would definitely be hitting up yard house a lot for happy hour with different groups of friends in the future.", 
            "i don't know if the yard house at town center is typical of other yard house locations... but my first impression of the one at town center is \"wow! the largest bar / sports bar i've ever been to!\" the bar must have been forty yards long with a circular seating arrangement... that's almost a football field length of seating just to consume liquor or watch your favorite team on one of the lcd tvs. don't feel comfortable at the \"bar\"? ... well there's dimly lit table seating around the extremities of the interior of the yard house, as well as outside seating under a covered patio.\n\nif you're not consuming your liquor at happy hour here at the yard house... you have a lot more money to spare than i do, or you're just being extravagant for no rational reason. lindeman's framboise at only $4.00 a glass! raspberry cider, also at the same price! and, the happy hour extends late into the night...\n\nas for the food... specifically the appetizers... the menu needs work...\n\n  <mark>Spicy Thai Chicken</mark> pizza (*) first of all, it's a thin-crust pizza.. a \n      negative already! carrots, green onion, cilantro, mozzarella, \n      macadamia nuts, and firecracker sauce as a topping... essentially \n      very, very close to a vegan pizza. prior apologies to all vegans... \n      yecch!\n  chicken lettuce wrap (**** 1/2) stir fried, smoked tofu, pine nuts and \n      green onions with three dipping sauces with a meat choice of either \n      chicken, tiger shrimp, or shiitake and portabella mushrooms. very, \n      very good. \n  <mark>Onion Ring Tower</mark> (****) beer battered and dusted with parmesan \n      cheese... served with chipotle and ranch dip sauces. and... i don't \n      even like onion rings... that's saying a lot for the perfectly made \n      onion rings!\n  <mark>Chicken Nachos</mark> (**) thin, and i mean thin tortilla chips with cheddar \n      and jack cheese, tomato, cilantro, onions, guacamole and spicy \n      whole pinto beans. chips were deteriorating as we sat. word to the \n      wise... consume this appetizer quickly, or it just turns into mush. \n      definitely, not as good as one of the many cheap, late-night taquerias \n      you can find around las vegas.\n  <mark>Fried Calamari</mark> (**** 1/2) an appetizer which i never order because most \n      restaurants usually over-fry the calamari where it becomes \n      super-tough and chewy... but not that night when we consumed it! \n      served with spicy tomato and tartar sauces.\n  <mark>Spicy Tuna Roll</mark> (**) definitely, not a favorite at the table. not enough \n      tuna, maybe? or it could've been the odd mixture of textures with an \n      almost crunchy edamame. <mark>Pan Seared Ahi</mark> tuna with avocado, edamame, \n      cucumber and wasabi soy sauce.\n  <mark>Classic Sliders</mark> (***) nothing special here. four mini burgers made from \n      naturewell natural angus beef served with cheddar cheese, house \n      special sauce, fries and pickle. preparation of the fries were better \n      than the sliders!\n\ndo you know what it takes to transport all the liquor over to the bar area? as i was looking around yard house to take some pics... i noticed the shiny pipes running along the ceiling emanating from the entrance area of yard house heading off in the direction of the bar. there are, literally, dozens of pipes that feed liquor to the bar stored in an orange-hued room ( http://static.px.yelp.com/bphoto/uxe7cbax8_9h82ljsg2jxw/l ) ( http://static.px.yelp.com/bphoto/a1ufhhyumxc145flbncylw/l ) to the left of the entrance as you walk in. moving that much liquor takes quite a bit of technology!\n\nliquor @ happy hour (*****)\nappetizers (***)\n\ndessert? not tonight. went back to my son's house for guava cake ( http://www.yelp.com/biz/akis-bakery-san-jose#hrid:nkspkohhhesyqkf1wn_nog ), which i brought over from san jose...",

            "my fave place for happy hour. especially great during football season. they have happy hour for monday night football from 'kick off' to the final play. i usually order their <mark>Fried Calamari</mark> and a glass of white wine. hubby and i consider ourselves \"regulars\". we've been to both yard houses in vegas. looking forward to the yard house that will be opening in san jose santana row in february 2011.", 
            "this has by far been one of the best happy hour menu's.  they have their sliders, pizza's, and popular appetizers at a low price.  well, if you bring a big group or if you're sharing for 2.  you can get about 3 to 4 dishes for almost $13.00.  \n\nthe atmosphere of this place is ok, if you like that fast paced and loud noise ambiance.  it's tolerable, and i have yet to experience bad service.  the servers are quick to get your order, great with drink refills, and the food comes out in less than 20 mins.  (*quick note: never eat here, not unless it's happy hour, otherwise you'd be paying $10 - $15 for appetizers and entree's*) \n\nthings to order:  \n- chicken lettuce wrap - ground chicken sauteed with diced mushrooms, onion leaves, and spices, served upon a fried wonton bowl accompanied with 8-9 <mark>Lettuce Wraps</mark>.  there are three types of sauces, i think regular, mild and spicy?  i'm not too sure on that, but the regular sauce is my favorite.  \n\n- <mark>Fried Calamari</mark> - nothing too special, but a definite must have for a vast mix.  the calamari is always fried to a crisp, tossed in a salt a pepper mix served with tartar sauce and a marinara sauce i think?  \n\n- hawaiian <mark>Poke Stack</mark> - for some reason the fish tastes very fresh, as opposed to other restaurants who try their hardest to execute a poke dish.  yardhouse i'd say, prepares it well.  ahi poke tossed in a hawaiian style marinade, served upon two wonton crisps with soy & sesame oil bean sprouts and carrots.  \n\n- onion ring stack - an <mark>Onion Ring Tower</mark> served with two types of sauces: ranch and chipotle.  i personally like the chipotle sauce.  the onion rings are fried to perfection, the onions doesn't slip out of the fried batter.  \n\n- <mark>Chicken Nachos</mark> - mmmmmm, a huge plate of nachos served with the toppings of a mexican nacho.  the cheese sizzles when served and the chicken is quite succulent, although the pieces should be chopped up a little more.  \n\n- <mark>Spinach Cheese Dip</mark> - my very favorite, spinach and cheese mixed together in a hot mix (not spicy).  served with largely cut toasted bread instead of chips!  what's even better, they lightly top the bread with parmesan! \n\nthis a definite must go to if you're having a get together.  the food is good, and so is the experience.  another pro to this, is that after eating you can go watch a movie.  since the movie theatre is in fact right across the building.", 
            "been wanting to try this place for a long time. i was with a friend, a vegetarian friend, and trying to decide where to eat, i remembered about yard house serving vegan food. i also like vegan dishes but i like to add meat to them just for flavor. i ordered the <mark>Fried Calamari</mark>, not calamari rings, this one had tentacles and all. also ordered the <mark>Vodka Shrimp Pasta</mark>, which it was very good even though i couldn't taste the vodka.

            "absolutely our favorite.  we eat here at least 40 times already.  they have two location one at red rock casino and one at town square.  if you are picky about the food, the food at red rock is slightly better than the one at town square so is the service.  happy hour is from 3-6 pm monday to wednesday.  late happy hour is after 11 pm til 2 am sunday to wednesday.  we recommend the <mark><mark>Bbq Chicken</mark></mark> pizza, <mark>Blue Crab Cakes</mark>, jamaican jerk wings, chinese chicken lettuce wrap, turkey slider not burger, <mark>Fried Calamari</mark>, try most of the happy hour appitizer they are pretty damn good.  outside of the happy hour menu, the food is pretty good and a little expensive for what it's worth to us.  beer seletction here is ridiculous!  something like over 100 different one.  they have tv all around with sport channel usually showing so this is great for all those that watch sports.",

            "not sure what's more embarrassing: the fact that the other day before going to see the master at rave (two thumbs up!) that i spent $120 on dinner for 2 at yard house, or the fact that i thought it was worth every penny.  this is not to say that the average opinion on the yardhouse is low, but i do think it's typically thought of as a place to grab some cheap happy hour appetizers and some beer and not a place to spend $30 on entrees.  well i did that, and i was damn happy with the results.\n\nwe arrived shortly before happy hour ended and i started with a black and tan and we also ordered the seared <mark>Ahi Sashimi </mark> appetizer which i was pleasantly surprised to find half off on the happy hour menu (which also discounted the price on the beer a bit).   i've had the ahi appetizer here several times and it's almost always a winner.  i'll venture to say it's the best of it's kind among chain restaurants.  for entrees my dining partner got the <mark>Pepper Crusted Filet</mark> mignon and i ordered the <mark>Ginger Crusted Norwegian Salmon</mark>.   both were accompanied with wasabi mashed potatoes which i've always enjoyed for that slight hint of wasabi in every bite.  my salmon was a little masked with all the toppings (namely carrot strings, the ginger crust, and the sesame vinaigrette).   usually i would find this to be a negative, but i''ll be damned if all of the ingredients really work together here.  i've been known to sneak a bite of the salmon on it's own from time to time anyhow and found it to be nicely cooked.\n\nthe one issue with the entire meal was the filet which was ordered medium was a little inconsistently cooked.  some of it seemed cooked medium well (little to no pink) while some of it did seem cooked as ordered.  i was able to taste a little of both sections and found them both tasty, though the one with some pink was more to my liking.  \n\nservice was great throughout and we ordered several jack and cokes once happy hour ended and they were constantly being refreshed.  when we informed the waitress we had a movie to make she made sure to bring the check to us quickly.  when the check first arrived i was slightly taken aback by the price (and the amount of alcohol we'd consumed), but realized it had been worth it.  it also made me appreciate that i could go into the yardhouse and make a choice on whether to have a great $30 experience of a couple of drinks, an <mark>Onion Ring Tower</mark> and a sandwich, or go all out and have a great steak or piece of fish for extra.  you can't do that (or much of anything else) at applebee's folks!  \n\nlater on in the theater while everyone else was fleeing for the exit midway through, we sat content.  i initially blamed this on poor movie taste by the others, but in retrospect perhaps it was the contentedness of the meal beforehand that transferred over to our cinema experience.", 
            "i admit it, i'm a yard house whore. \n\ni seriously love this place. the restaurant has such a chill and laid back vibe. it's huge and has ample seating. they have nice cushiony booths so if you and a date come by then you can have a semi-romantic dinner on one of those. want to sit outside? they have a nice patio area in which they have heaters for the chillier days. they have tvs all over the place with different channels. games are on most of the time. if you want to watch a specific game on a specific tv, all you have to do is ask.\n\ni'm not a big beer person. but yard house is the one place i will indulge in a glass (or two...or three...). my favorite beer is the lindeman's framboise. a belgian lambic beer, it has the perfect cidery raspberry taste. they serve it in some sort of champagne glass - it makes me want to pinky up because i feel almost sophisticated drinking it! i also love their fruit ciders, especially their pear cider. the snakebite is also divine - it's a blend of the pear cider and harp. besides their beer, they have pretty good specialty mixed drinks. one that comes to mind is their pomegranate margarita. tart and pomegranite-y with a pretty presentation!\n\ntheir food awesome! my faves are listed below:\n\n[before i list specific food items, i'd like to say that yard house has really really good fries. they're super thin and super addicting. if you're into the thick cut steak fries, you won't find them here]\n\nappetizers\n- seared <mark>Ahi Sashimi </mark>: about 6 pieces of seared tuna covered in soy vinaigrette is served next to a small bed of red cabbage also covered in the vinaigrette. i really like this dish when it's made right. sometimes they over-drench the sashimi pieces and the dish becomes ultra salty.\n- <mark>Onion Ring Tower</mark>: literally, the name says it all. it's apparently beer battered and comes with a chipotle ketchup and ranch dressing. \n- <mark>Spicy Tuna Roll</mark>: if you're expecting a typical sushi roll, then don't. this is served without rice and as a stack. bottom layer are edamame and cucumbers. middle layer is your tuna and the top layer is the avocado. it's a pretty dish. very innovative. \n- sliders: specifically the bearnaise or ahi sliders. four sliders plus a handful of fries. they call this an appetizer, but the portions are not appetizer-like!\n\nentree\n- mac & cheese squared: chicken, bacon, mushrooms, truffle oil. can't go wrong with this one. they use wild mushrooms that elevated your boring mac & cheese to the next level. \n[this is it for entrees. i usually stick with their appetizers.]\n\ndessert\n- chocolate souffle: small souffle good for one. scoop of vanilla ice cream on top with mint garnish. do not leave without trying this. i'm seriously serious. \n\nyard house has great happy hour. 3 pm - 6 pm monday - friday and 10 pm - close sunday - thursday. drink specials and half off on a lot of their appetizers! their sliders are discounted as well. perfect late night meal.", 
            "yard house has been one of my favorite hang out spots with friends for the longest time. it's at town square and right by unlv, perfect place to go to during happy hour with the amount of draft beers they have!!\n\nthe restaurant is huge inside with outdoor seating!! i like sitting outside during fall/spring time frame and definitely indoors during winter and summer. it's a laid back chill environment that's good for everyone. the ambient lighting is good for that kind of romantic feeling if you want it to be, but also just to relax and chill. \n\ni'm here for happy hour with a bunch of friends usually, we used to frequent this place at least once a week, now not so much as we're getting tired of the same ol' thing, lol. \n\ni like trying something different every time i come here as far as the draft beer goes. i've tried almost everything and found some of my favorite types through doing this! just gotta keep an open mind and be willing to try something new in order for this to work out! amber ales have been my favorites, followed by stouts, and then lagers, but i've also been spoiled by what's on tap and now i stay away from bottled beer as much as possible! it really does taste different.\n\nwith my friends and i, we usually just stick around to what's on the appetizer menu, because they're half off during happy hour. some of our favorites include the <mark>Chicken Nachos</mark>, chicken tenders, seared <mark>Ahi Sashimi </mark>, sliders, spinach <mark>Lobster, Crab & Artichoke Dip</mark>, and pizza. you'll almost always see these items on our table from the happy hour menu. other items we usually end up ordering are the <mark>Truffle Fries</mark> and the mac & cheese. the portions are decent for the appetizers and good for sharing, especially the <mark>Chicken Nachos</mark>. \n\nit's good for just all around hang out with a bunch of friends to just relax and catch up. i don't usually do large groups at other places, but here it's fine, because it does get pretty loud.",

            "for my first time at a yard house, i was very impressed. it reminded me of bj's, but it was more of a college/older crowd place rather than a place you can bring your family. \n\nwe went here during their happy hour, 3-6 pm monday-friday. appetizers were 1/2 off, as well as beer/martinis. i tried the pomegranate martini, which was excellent! i love pom juice, and this drink didn't make my face squint. i couldn't even taste the alcohol! by the end of the night, i had my asian glow face after a few sips from my glass. geez! it was that good!\n\nfor appetizers, my friends and i had an array of different foods: <mark>Blue Crab Cakes</mark>, ham and pineapple pizza, firecracker wings, buffalo wings, chicken lettuce wrap, <mark>Chicken <mark>Shiitake <mark>Lobster Garlic Noodles</mark></mark></mark>, sliders, and <mark>Spicy Tuna Roll</mark>. all of the appetizers were pretty good.\n\ni was also able to try their raspberry beer, lindemans framboise. it was mighty tasty, and again tasted like juice. i also found out you can make floats out of the draft beers. maybe the chocolate stout with vanilla ice cream? yum!\n\ni definitely would come back here and bring another group of friends. \n\nbtw, you can call ahead thurs-sun to get a table.", 
            "fun place to go for drinks and good times with friends!  i agree that the happy hour from 3-6 pm is definitely pretty sweet.  can't go wrong with 1/2 on appetizers and drinks.  for appetizers, we tried the onion rings, <mark><mark>California Roll</mark></mark>, <mark><mark>Gardein Fried Chicken Strips</mark></mark>, <mark>Fried Calamari</mark>, <mark>Spicy Tuna Roll</mark>, and <mark>Blue Crab Cakes</mark>.  onion rings, <mark>Fried Calamari</mark>, and <mark>Blue Crab Cakes</mark> were all nice & crispy.  <mark><mark>Gardein Fried Chicken Strips</mark></mark> came with fries and were good as well, but nothing out of the ordinary.  the <mark><mark>California Roll</mark></mark> and <mark>Spicy Tuna Roll</mark> were interesting, in that their presentation was unlike that of those you see in a sushi restaurant.  they actually came as one huge, cut sushi piece, kind of like a cake or a tart.  the presentation was pretty unique, but the taste was also good but nothing really special.  if i was really craving sushi, i'd probably go check out normal sushi places like osaka, sushi club, or something along those lines.  for drinks, i've tried the mangolicious martini, the malibu peach martini, blue moon beer, and wyder's raspberry cider.  i'm usually not a huge beer drinker, but the wyder's was good...nice raspberry taste! of course, looove the martinis!  and to top it all off, we all shared a kona coffee ice cream sundae, which was to die for!!! i would definitely be hitting up yard house a lot for happy hour with different groups of friends in the future.",

            "what a great, great last time out in vegas.\n\ni was invited to a get together with some work folks and was accompanied by the ultimate gentleman.  i have fond memories of many of their locations (costa mesa, irvine, long beach and west palm beach) and it was always with a crowd, so this is one of those chain places where good times are guaranteed.  \n\nwe went for happy hour since the appetizers were half priced and pints were 3.25.  the beer selection is huge and my companion and i had a hard time in choosing something to start with.  one of the two servers taking care of our table suggested we get a \"pre-designed\" sampler.  this is when the bar selects six beers for you, rather than you choosing six, and they stay within a certain medium, such as pale ales, darks, etc.  we wanted something in the medium category.  \n\nthe sampler is something i totally recommend you do if you're undecided about what beer you'd like and you have someone to share with you.  we sipped each beer, rated them accordingly, and decided our top three, in order, were redhook esb, redhook blond, and fat tire's new belgium.  since the top two were the new belgium and the blond, we ordered pints of each and shared 'em.\n\nas for the appetizers, we picked up an order of the <mark><mark>Gardein Fried Chicken Strips</mark></mark> and hawaiian <mark>Poke Stack</mark>.  great choices (kinda hard to mess up <mark><mark>Gardein Fried Chicken Strips</mark></mark>, though); the poke was a pretty good portion for an appetizer and was tasty!  \n\nboth of the servers were outstanding in tending to our party of 14.  very attentive, didn't miss a beat, and were great about reminding everyone to get their last orders in before happy hour ended.  can't beat that!\n\nif only the yard house were in the dmv.....", 
            "yardhouse is a nice, laid back restaurant with hundreds of beers to try, many on tap, and some great food.  the first time i tried this restaurant was a few years back, and i absolutely love it.\n\nif you love beer and some great food, you must try this place.  they serve fresh fish every day and it's cooked to order.  we always have the fresh fish when we eat dinner there.  lunch time is usually something else, like their mac n cheese squared or some sliders.  what i enjoy about this place is their variety of foods, from american to asian.  \n\nwant to save money and still eat well?  their appetizers could be a meal in itself!  they are huge portions and things like <mark><mark>Gardein Fried Chicken Strips</mark></mark> come with fries, anyway, so you can always order a beer and save money on the food. i really do love eating here and haven't tried everything on the menu yet.  i'm looking forward to more culinary adventures here soon!\n\nsome great tips: always ask your server about their favorite beers, or what beer they prefer from lagers, stouts, etc.  they are well versed in their beer and usually their preference is really good.  another thing--their portions are big, so if you're a small eater order one dish for 2 people.  seating can take awhile in the evenings, so coming in around 830/9pm may help seat you sooner.  if you want to eat dinner between 5-7 and you can't find parking, just use the valet right next to the restaurant side of town square.  it's open till the early morning and saves tons of time on finding that open space.", 
            "the cheesecake factory of beer and food. \n\ndinner is a little pricey so i like to come out more for the happy hour where you can get pizzas, wings, <mark><mark>Gardein Fried Chicken Strips</mark></mark>, etc.  it's probably a step up above kona in terms of the happy hour foods.\n\ni enjoy the beer flights so i can sample a little bit of everything.\n\none thing i don't like about the town square location (and this is probably true at all town square restaurants)  is that it is the dbc....dbc being douche bag central.....and the later u go, the more u will come across them.  no further explanation needed", 
            "boy is yard house pricey. good thing for the invention of happy hour. they hold theirs monday through friday from 4pm-6pm. my group got there at 4:45 and racked up most of the damage before hh ended, but the last few items boosted the check up by a third. \n\nthe well drinks run for four dollars and change, while the beers cost around four to six dollars. all the appetizers are half off and a great deal. if you are like me, a few of them makes for a better meal than any entree. \n\nwe got the <mark>Chicken Nachos</mark>, <mark><mark>Gardein Fried Chicken Strips</mark></mark>, <mark>Pan Seared Ahi</mark>, <mark>Classic Sliders</mark>, hummus, a pepperoni and mushroom pizza, and chicken wings. if you come during the designated time, then all of these except the hummus are half off. it is a great deal, but i would reconsider if it was at full price. they are generous with their portions. both the sliders and <mark><mark>Gardein Fried Chicken Strips</mark></mark> come in an order of four with fries. this was perfect because it matched the number of people at our table. both dishes would be worth it at the regular price. the ahi tuna was cooked nicely, but the sauce was too salty. it definitely did not need soy sauce, but i used up all the wasabi. the <mark>Chicken Nachos</mark> were nothing special. it is a generous portion, but the salsa looked more like marinara, the chicken was on the dry side, and the guacamole lacked the tang and spice. they were also bountiful with the wings. asking for them to be cooked extra crispy and having the sauce on the side guarantees for perfect wings. the hummus was packed with sodium and tasted a little bitter. the pizza came out quick, bubbling, and beautiful. too bad, i was too full by that time, but my friend liked it.  \n\nif you ever wanted to try a new beer, but afraid you might not like it, come for happy hour. at worst, you are out a few dollars. at best, you might meet your new best friend. \n\nanother thing worth mentioning, the staff were on their game tonight. it was not that busy, but our server was awesome. crystal was funny, sassy, and full of energy. \n\nthe only reason why i gave them three stars is because i worry about the amount of salt they use in all of their dishes. i know people complain about msg at chinese restaurant, but i drank five glasses of water while dining and am still guzzling it now. it was tasty, but my taste buds are on over drive and going nuts.", 
            "i have recently gone vegetarian and i find some sort of irony that this new diet is what has brought me to yardhouse in vegas for the first time. i have been to yardhouse before in a few other cities, but had a friend tell me last week about their vegetarian menu.\n\nthey use a meat substitute called gardein and it can be used in any of their dishes but they even have a section of the menu devoted to all of their vegetarian dishes. i decided to choose the chicken & veggie bowl with jasmine rice.. i expected it to be like a teriyaki sauce, but i have to admit that was my own assumption... in spite of not being sweet like i expected, it was a very delicious meal that i thoroughly enjoyed. my friend ordered the veggie <mark><mark>Gardein Fried Chicken Strips</mark></mark> with a side of <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>. of course i had to try this and i have to admit i would have loved to have ordered those too...\n\ni think this is going to be another one of my new spots to frequent as it can totally fit into my diet and keep others around me happy too...\n\nyay!!!\n\nps: can someone tell me why this isn't classified under vegetarian?? i would have found it a lot sooner...", 
            "i've been here a couple times before, but once i turned 21 this has been one of my go-to spots for happy hour because the specials are amazing! the fact that they have mini take home happy hour menus makes it all the more tempting as well. \n\nallow me break it down for you:\nhappy hour is mon-fri 3pm-6pm, sun-wed 10pm-close\n\ndomestic pints - $3.50, craft&import pints - $4.25-$4.75\nsliders served on a bed of fries  ($6.75): classic, bearnaise, pastrami, turkey, veggie. ahi is $9.95\n\nhalf priced pizzas: <mark><mark>Bbq Chicken</mark></mark>, 4cheese, ham & pineapple, margherita, pepperoni & mushroom, <mark>Spicy Thai Chicken</mark>\n\nhalf priced apps: <mark>Blue Crab Cakes</mark>, calamari, cali roll, chinese <mark>Chicken <mark>Shiitake <mark>Lobster Garlic Noodles</mark></mark></mark>, <mark>Chicken Nachos</mark>, <mark>Onion Ring Tower</mark>, wings, boneless wings, veggie wings, hawaiian <mark>Poke Stack</mark>, <mark>Spicy Tuna Roll</mark>, seared <mark>Ahi Sashimi </mark>, chicken <mark>Lettuce Wraps</mark>, <mark><mark>Gardein Fried Chicken Strips</mark></mark>, <mark>Spinach Cheese Dip</mark>, <mark>Moo Shu Egg Rolls</mark>\n\ndoesn't that just blow your mind? it's like a plethora of cheap happy hour eats and you'll probably get full off of one order of sliders, or 2 of their apps. \n\nso far i've tried:\n-bearnaise sliders (bearnaise sauce and fried shoestring onions on the patty w/ a side of very skinny fries that are tenderly cooked with a very light batter coating which gives them a perfectly crunchy exterior and \"juicy\" inside)\n-<mark><mark>Bbq Chicken</mark></mark> and <mark>Margherita Pizza</mark> (they pretty much taste as they should. sometimes the <mark><mark>Bbq Chicken</mark></mark> is a little too saucy for my taste though)\n-calamari (yum. perfectly fried on the outside and melting on the inside. served w/ marinara and, i wanna say tartar sauce? i usually go with the red..)\n-traditional wings (first and last time i had these, they were so spicy! my bf couldn't even handle them and he claims to love hot stuff, hehe. the thing that i don't like about these wings is that you can't choose how spicy you want them, so you have to be prepared for whatever they give you)\n\neverything i've tried has been pretty good so far and there is still so much more i have yet to try! i know my boyfriend has been having some sort of frenzy over the happy hour <mark>Poke Stack</mark>. he's gone to this location about 4 times in the past month, by himself, just to sit and eat the <mark>Poke Stack</mark>, so i can only guess how delicious it must be. \n\nkey points:\n-happy hour is awesome here\n-traditional wings are hot! (at least for me)\n-calamari is delectable\n-french fries are close to perfect\n-great for groups\n-service has been pretty fast on the days that i've gone", 
            "visit on 1/21/12\n\nnormally i experience a 4 at the yard house but this experience was a 2 at best...i'm giving them a 3 for benefit of the doubt.  service was s  l  oooooooooow... it was semi-busy but we have been there at busier times.  we started with the onion rings-tasty as usual.  my husband ordered the <mark>Grilled Pastrami</mark> which he said was very good.  i had the <mark>Spicy Thai Chicken</mark> noodle salad.  there was a generous serving of perfectly grilled <mark><mark>Gardein Fried Chicken Strips</mark></mark> on the salad.  the noodles were slightly tough but otherwise a tasty dish.\n\nthe music was extremely loud during our visit.  we gave up on talking.  getting our check took at least 10 minutes until my husband had to ask another passing waiter.", 
            "surprisingly good food all around. i got to try a lot of things, including a blue crab cake hoagie with house <mark><mark>Classic Ranch Salad</mark></mark> (lunch menu), <mark>Chicken Nachos</mark>, <mark>Onion Ring Tower</mark>, <mark>Fried Calamari</mark>, and <mark><mark>Gardein Fried Chicken Strips</mark></mark> w/ fries (disclaimer: didn't double-check the menu, so not all names of food items may be accurate). for some reason, out of all of those, i found myself munching on the fries and dipping them on the honey mustard that accompanied the chicken. i guess the fries were just in the sweet spot of crunchiness and fluffiness, and the honey mustard was way too addictive. i can't speak for the beer, but everybody at my table seemed to enjoy theirs and they have a huge selection. finally,  gotta love a place that plays some beatles and some george harrison.\n\ni also wanted to add a tip for finding this place. gotta locate it before you can enjoy it, you know? it's kinda hidden if you're driving along most of the streets, so locate it on a map of town square beforehand or else just park somewhere and walk around. i think it might be best if you park near h&m and take the alley that starts off with the sushi bar and yogurtland, then walk past the \"clearing\" in the middle. you should see it on the right.",

            "i don't know if the yard house at town center is typical of other yard house locations... but my first impression of the one at town center is \"wow! the largest bar / sports bar i've ever been to!\" the bar must have been forty yards long with a circular seating arrangement... that's almost a football field length of seating just to consume liquor or watch your favorite team on one of the lcd tvs. don't feel comfortable at the \"bar\"? ... well there's dimly lit table seating around the extremities of the interior of the yard house, as well as outside seating under a covered patio.\n\nif you're not consuming your liquor at happy hour here at the yard house... you have a lot more money to spare than i do, or you're just being extravagant for no rational reason. lindeman's framboise at only $4.00 a glass! raspberry cider, also at the same price! and, the happy hour extends late into the night...\n\nas for the food... specifically the appetizers... the menu needs work...\n\n  <mark>Spicy Thai Chicken</mark> pizza (*) first of all, it's a thin-crust pizza.. a \n      negative already! carrots, green onion, cilantro, mozzarella, \n      macadamia nuts, and firecracker sauce as a topping... essentially \n      very, very close to a vegan pizza. prior apologies to all vegans... \n      yecch!\n  chicken lettuce wrap (**** 1/2) stir fried, smoked tofu, pine nuts and \n      green onions with three dipping sauces with a meat choice of either \n      chicken, tiger shrimp, or shiitake and portabella mushrooms. very, \n      very good. \n  <mark>Onion Ring Tower</mark> (****) beer battered and dusted with parmesan \n      cheese... served with chipotle and ranch dip sauces. and... i don't \n      even like onion rings... that's saying a lot for the perfectly made \n      onion rings!\n  <mark>Chicken Nachos</mark> (**) thin, and i mean thin tortilla chips with cheddar \n      and jack cheese, tomato, cilantro, onions, guacamole and spicy \n      whole pinto beans. chips were deteriorating as we sat. word to the \n      wise... consume this appetizer quickly, or it just turns into mush. \n      definitely, not as good as one of the many cheap, late-night taquerias \n      you can find around las vegas.\n  <mark>Fried Calamari</mark> (**** 1/2) an appetizer which i never order because most \n      restaurants usually over-fry the calamari where it becomes \n      super-tough and chewy... but not that night when we consumed it! \n      served with spicy tomato and tartar sauces.\n  <mark>Spicy Tuna Roll</mark> (**) definitely, not a favorite at the table. not enough \n      tuna, maybe? or it could've been the odd mixture of textures with an \n      almost crunchy edamame. <mark>Pan Seared Ahi</mark> tuna with avocado, edamame, \n      cucumber and wasabi soy sauce.\n  <mark>Classic Sliders</mark> (***) nothing special here. four mini burgers made from \n      naturewell natural angus beef served with cheddar cheese, house \n      special sauce, fries and pickle. preparation of the fries were better \n      than the sliders!\n\ndo you know what it takes to transport all the liquor over to the bar area? as i was looking around yard house to take some pics... i noticed the shiny pipes running along the ceiling emanating from the entrance area of yard house heading off in the direction of the bar. there are, literally, dozens of pipes that feed liquor to the bar stored in an orange-hued room ( http://static.px.yelp.com/bphoto/uxe7cbax8_9h82ljsg2jxw/l ) ( http://static.px.yelp.com/bphoto/a1ufhhyumxc145flbncylw/l ) to the left of the entrance as you walk in. moving that much liquor takes quite a bit of technology!\n\nliquor @ happy hour (*****)\nappetizers (***)\n\ndessert? not tonight. went back to my son's house for guava cake ( http://www.yelp.com/biz/akis-bakery-san-jose#hrid:nkspkohhhesyqkf1wn_nog ), which i brought over from san jose...",

            "this has by far been one of the best happy hour menu's.  they have their sliders, pizza's, and popular appetizers at a low price.  well, if you bring a big group or if you're sharing for 2.  you can get about 3 to 4 dishes for almost $13.00.  \n\nthe atmosphere of this place is ok, if you like that fast paced and loud noise ambiance.  it's tolerable, and i have yet to experience bad service.  the servers are quick to get your order, great with drink refills, and the food comes out in less than 20 mins.  (*quick note: never eat here, not unless it's happy hour, otherwise you'd be paying $10 - $15 for appetizers and entree's*) \n\nthings to order:  \n- chicken lettuce wrap - ground chicken sauteed with diced mushrooms, onion leaves, and spices, served upon a fried wonton bowl accompanied with 8-9 <mark>Lettuce Wraps</mark>.  there are three types of sauces, i think regular, mild and spicy?  i'm not too sure on that, but the regular sauce is my favorite.  \n\n- <mark>Fried Calamari</mark> - nothing too special, but a definite must have for a vast mix.  the calamari is always fried to a crisp, tossed in a salt a pepper mix served with tartar sauce and a marinara sauce i think?  \n\n- hawaiian <mark>Poke Stack</mark> - for some reason the fish tastes very fresh, as opposed to other restaurants who try their hardest to execute a poke dish.  yardhouse i'd say, prepares it well.  ahi poke tossed in a hawaiian style marinade, served upon two wonton crisps with soy & sesame oil bean sprouts and carrots.  \n\n- onion ring stack - an <mark>Onion Ring Tower</mark> served with two types of sauces: ranch and chipotle.  i personally like the chipotle sauce.  the onion rings are fried to perfection, the onions doesn't slip out of the fried batter.  \n\n- <mark>Chicken Nachos</mark> - mmmmmm, a huge plate of nachos served with the toppings of a mexican nacho.  the cheese sizzles when served and the chicken is quite succulent, although the pieces should be chopped up a little more.  \n\n- <mark>Spinach Cheese Dip</mark> - my very favorite, spinach and cheese mixed together in a hot mix (not spicy).  served with largely cut toasted bread instead of chips!  what's even better, they lightly top the bread with parmesan! \n\nthis a definite must go to if you're having a get together.  the food is good, and so is the experience.  another pro to this, is that after eating you can go watch a movie.  since the movie theatre is in fact right across the building.",

            "i've been here a couple times before, but once i turned 21 this has been one of my go-to spots for happy hour because the specials are amazing! the fact that they have mini take home happy hour menus makes it all the more tempting as well. \n\nallow me break it down for you:\nhappy hour is mon-fri 3pm-6pm, sun-wed 10pm-close\n\ndomestic pints - $3.50, craft&import pints - $4.25-$4.75\nsliders served on a bed of fries  ($6.75): classic, bearnaise, pastrami, turkey, veggie. ahi is $9.95\n\nhalf priced pizzas: <mark><mark>Bbq Chicken</mark></mark>, 4cheese, ham & pineapple, margherita, pepperoni & mushroom, <mark>Spicy Thai Chicken</mark>\n\nhalf priced apps: <mark>Blue Crab Cakes</mark>, calamari, cali roll, chinese <mark>Chicken <mark>Shiitake <mark>Lobster Garlic Noodles</mark></mark></mark>, <mark>Chicken Nachos</mark>, <mark>Onion Ring Tower</mark>, wings, boneless wings, veggie wings, hawaiian <mark>Poke Stack</mark>, <mark>Spicy Tuna Roll</mark>, seared <mark>Ahi Sashimi </mark>, chicken <mark>Lettuce Wraps</mark>, <mark><mark>Gardein Fried Chicken Strips</mark></mark>, <mark>Spinach Cheese Dip</mark>, <mark>Moo Shu Egg Rolls</mark>\n\ndoesn't that just blow your mind? it's like a plethora of cheap happy hour eats and you'll probably get full off of one order of sliders, or 2 of their apps. \n\nso far i've tried:\n-bearnaise sliders (bearnaise sauce and fried shoestring onions on the patty w/ a side of very skinny fries that are tenderly cooked with a very light batter coating which gives them a perfectly crunchy exterior and \"juicy\" inside)\n-<mark><mark>Bbq Chicken</mark></mark> and <mark>Margherita Pizza</mark> (they pretty much taste as they should. sometimes the <mark><mark>Bbq Chicken</mark></mark> is a little too saucy for my taste though)\n-calamari (yum. perfectly fried on the outside and melting on the inside. served w/ marinara and, i wanna say tartar sauce? i usually go with the red..)\n-traditional wings (first and last time i had these, they were so spicy! my bf couldn't even handle them and he claims to love hot stuff, hehe. the thing that i don't like about these wings is that you can't choose how spicy you want them, so you have to be prepared for whatever they give you)\n\neverything i've tried has been pretty good so far and there is still so much more i have yet to try! i know my boyfriend has been having some sort of frenzy over the happy hour <mark>Poke Stack</mark>. he's gone to this location about 4 times in the past month, by himself, just to sit and eat the <mark>Poke Stack</mark>, so i can only guess how delicious it must be. \n\nkey points:\n-happy hour is awesome here\n-traditional wings are hot! (at least for me)\n-calamari is delectable\n-french fries are close to perfect\n-great for groups\n-service has been pretty fast on the days that i've gone",

            "birthday party on a budget.  happy hour half off appetizers and drinks after 10pm, say what?!\n\nlast night, i joined two of my friends at the yard house to celebrate one of their birthdays.  i've eaten at the yard house many o' times  and love the beer choices.  the experience/food is not the worst, but it's not the best.  it's great for happy hour and i'm sticking to that!\n\nfor drinks, i just got the fat tire pint for about $5.  although i appreciate the 130+ beer choices, i'm partial to my fat tire/newcastle beers.  for food, we got a few appetizers which were all half off:  first, the  jamaican jerk style boneless wings.  came with a sweet hoisin type dipping sauce. the chicken was tender and the batter was delightful.  next, we had <mark>Moo Shu Egg Rolls</mark>-chicken, chili cream cheese, carrots, green onions, cilantro, spinach with apple ginger plum sauce.  the chicken was a little dry but was redeemed with the sweet plum sauce.  lastly, we got the <mark>Chicken Nachos</mark>-spicy pinto beans, cheddar, jack, red & green sauce, tomato, cilantro, onions, guacamole, sour cream.  it's a huge serving, but just your average bar nachos.  the cheese was a little hard.\n\ni did appreciate the great service that night.  the manager came over a few times, because a drunk lady invited herself on our table and then asked for us to pay her bar tab.  she was a little loud but somewhat funny.  our server was cordial, but not to impressionable.  \n\nthe happy hour will continue bringing me back to the yard house.  it isn't busy and we got a table right away.  there's typically a younger crowd which offers a hip vibe in my opinion.  let's just say that overall, i wouldn't necessarily wait longer than 15 minutes for a table unless you're crazy about beer.",

            "great service and great atmosphere! it had a lot of items to choose from on the menu which was a real plus. our waitress stayed on top of everything and was very nice. i had the wings which were good, the sauce was a lot like al's garage but were bigger but the meat was a little tough. liked the <mark>Onion Ring Tower</mark>, so good!! good prices too!", 
            "this has by far been one of the best happy hour menu's.  they have their sliders, pizza's, and popular appetizers at a low price.  well, if you bring a big group or if you're sharing for 2.  you can get about 3 to 4 dishes for almost $13.00.  \n\nthe atmosphere of this place is ok, if you like that fast paced and loud noise ambiance.  it's tolerable, and i have yet to experience bad service.  the servers are quick to get your order, great with drink refills, and the food comes out in less than 20 mins.  (*quick note: never eat here, not unless it's happy hour, otherwise you'd be paying $10 - $15 for appetizers and entree's*) \n\nthings to order:  \n- chicken lettuce wrap - ground chicken sauteed with diced mushrooms, onion leaves, and spices, served upon a fried wonton bowl accompanied with 8-9 <mark>Lettuce Wraps</mark>.  there are three types of sauces, i think regular, mild and spicy?  i'm not too sure on that, but the regular sauce is my favorite.  \n\n- <mark>Fried Calamari</mark> - nothing too special, but a definite must have for a vast mix.  the calamari is always fried to a crisp, tossed in a salt a pepper mix served with tartar sauce and a marinara sauce i think?  \n\n- hawaiian <mark>Poke Stack</mark> - for some reason the fish tastes very fresh, as opposed to other restaurants who try their hardest to execute a poke dish.  yardhouse i'd say, prepares it well.  ahi poke tossed in a hawaiian style marinade, served upon two wonton crisps with soy & sesame oil bean sprouts and carrots.  \n\n- onion ring stack - an <mark>Onion Ring Tower</mark> served with two types of sauces: ranch and chipotle.  i personally like the chipotle sauce.  the onion rings are fried to perfection, the onions doesn't slip out of the fried batter.  \n\n- <mark>Chicken Nachos</mark> - mmmmmm, a huge plate of nachos served with the toppings of a mexican nacho.  the cheese sizzles when served and the chicken is quite succulent, although the pieces should be chopped up a little more.  \n\n- <mark>Spinach Cheese Dip</mark> - my very favorite, spinach and cheese mixed together in a hot mix (not spicy).  served with largely cut toasted bread instead of chips!  what's even better, they lightly top the bread with parmesan! \n\nthis a definite must go to if you're having a get together.  the food is good, and so is the experience.  another pro to this, is that after eating you can go watch a movie.  since the movie theatre is in fact right across the building.", 
            "i was debating between 4 and 5 stars. but when i couldn't think of a single reason for a deduction... duh! 5 stars!!\nfat tire, peroni, newcastle brown, molson, lev... all on tap! what a beautiful and most wonderful thing to have over 100 beers on tap. \nand the food, my god, the food jerry!! i had the crabcake hoagie and loved it... we also had <mark>Pan Seared Ahi</mark> salad, <mark>Chicken <mark>Carnitas Enchilada Stack</mark></mark>, chicken fried chicken and an <mark>Onion Ring Tower</mark> at our table and each was unique and excellent in its own way.\nthe servers were friendly, fun and knew what they were doing. sharp, crisp service and decor. the music was a tad loud, making it difficult to have a conversation, but with all the beers, let's be honest... our conversation would have been mostly gibberish and forgotten by the next morning anyway.\nlove it here! this is a must when in vegas.", 
            "second time here, after a sunday evening at the movies, decided to return to yard house for dinner. i had the blonde house ale and that came fast and cold! i was thirsty and this hit the spot. \n\nfor an app, we had had the <mark>Onion Ring Tower</mark> once before and my husband ordered it again. it was just like our previous version, just fried onion rings served with dipping sauce, it was just okay. \n\ni wanted to try the <mark><mark>French Onion</mark> Soup</mark> and i could add that to my pastrami sandwich. the soup was really good, served with deep rich flavors of the beef broth and onions all covered with melted cheese and under cover, the french baguette bread. very good soup. \n\nmy pastrami sandwich was served with pickle and fries and had a fair amount of meat. it was served on fresh bread and was a decent size, my husband had ordered the seared tuna sandwich and we decided to trade off, he took half mine and i took half his. i do have to admit, my pastrami was better. the tuna was lightly seared and seemed fresh, but i like my tuna sashimi style without any bread! \n\nwe did enjoy the meal, however, i guess it's not an impressive place for eating. since their focus is on the over 100 beers served, this is more of a drinking place.", 
            "i've been here a couple times before, but once i turned 21 this has been one of my go-to spots for happy hour because the specials are amazing! the fact that they have mini take home happy hour menus makes it all the more tempting as well. \n\nallow me break it down for you:\nhappy hour is mon-fri 3pm-6pm, sun-wed 10pm-close\n\ndomestic pints - $3.50, craft&import pints - $4.25-$4.75\nsliders served on a bed of fries  ($6.75): classic, bearnaise, pastrami, turkey, veggie. ahi is $9.95\n\nhalf priced pizzas: <mark><mark>Bbq Chicken</mark></mark>, 4cheese, ham & pineapple, margherita, pepperoni & mushroom, <mark>Spicy Thai Chicken</mark>\n\nhalf priced apps: <mark>Blue Crab Cakes</mark>, calamari, cali roll, chinese <mark>Chicken <mark>Shiitake <mark>Lobster Garlic Noodles</mark></mark></mark>, <mark>Chicken Nachos</mark>, <mark>Onion Ring Tower</mark>, wings, boneless wings, veggie wings, hawaiian <mark>Poke Stack</mark>, <mark>Spicy Tuna Roll</mark>, seared <mark>Ahi Sashimi </mark>, chicken <mark>Lettuce Wraps</mark>, <mark><mark>Gardein Fried Chicken Strips</mark></mark>, <mark>Spinach Cheese Dip</mark>, <mark>Moo Shu Egg Rolls</mark>\n\ndoesn't that just blow your mind? it's like a plethora of cheap happy hour eats and you'll probably get full off of one order of sliders, or 2 of their apps. \n\nso far i've tried:\n-bearnaise sliders (bearnaise sauce and fried shoestring onions on the patty w/ a side of very skinny fries that are tenderly cooked with a very light batter coating which gives them a perfectly crunchy exterior and \"juicy\" inside)\n-<mark><mark>Bbq Chicken</mark></mark> and <mark>Margherita Pizza</mark> (they pretty much taste as they should. sometimes the <mark><mark>Bbq Chicken</mark></mark> is a little too saucy for my taste though)\n-calamari (yum. perfectly fried on the outside and melting on the inside. served w/ marinara and, i wanna say tartar sauce? i usually go with the red..)\n-traditional wings (first and last time i had these, they were so spicy! my bf couldn't even handle them and he claims to love hot stuff, hehe. the thing that i don't like about these wings is that you can't choose how spicy you want them, so you have to be prepared for whatever they give you)\n\neverything i've tried has been pretty good so far and there is still so much more i have yet to try! i know my boyfriend has been having some sort of frenzy over the happy hour <mark>Poke Stack</mark>. he's gone to this location about 4 times in the past month, by himself, just to sit and eat the <mark>Poke Stack</mark>, so i can only guess how delicious it must be. \n\nkey points:\n-happy hour is awesome here\n-traditional wings are hot! (at least for me)\n-calamari is delectable\n-french fries are close to perfect\n-great for groups\n-service has been pretty fast on the days that i've gone", 
            "surprisingly good food all around. i got to try a lot of things, including a blue crab cake hoagie with house <mark><mark>Classic Ranch Salad</mark></mark> (lunch menu), <mark>Chicken Nachos</mark>, <mark>Onion Ring Tower</mark>, <mark>Fried Calamari</mark>, and <mark><mark>Gardein Fried Chicken Strips</mark></mark> w/ fries (disclaimer: didn't double-check the menu, so not all names of food items may be accurate). for some reason, out of all of those, i found myself munching on the fries and dipping them on the honey mustard that accompanied the chicken. i guess the fries were just in the sweet spot of crunchiness and fluffiness, and the honey mustard was way too addictive. i can't speak for the beer, but everybody at my table seemed to enjoy theirs and they have a huge selection. finally,  gotta love a place that plays some beatles and some george harrison.\n\ni also wanted to add a tip for finding this place. gotta locate it before you can enjoy it, you know? it's kinda hidden if you're driving along most of the streets, so locate it on a map of town square beforehand or else just park somewhere and walk around. i think it might be best if you park near h&m and take the alley that starts off with the sushi bar and yogurtland, then walk past the \"clearing\" in the middle. you should see it on the right.", 
            "pros:\n* delicious food. you have to try the <mark><mark>Gardein Blackened Chicken Torta</mark></mark> soup.\n* friendly staff.\n* modern menu and decor.\n\ncons:\n* expensive. the food while good is slightly too expensive.\n* due to the popularity, they're generally crowded with long waits.\n\ni believe town square to be the best shopping and restaurant plaza in las vegas. the quantity of choices for either is only matched by the quality. there certainly is no shortage of great food at town square and on yelp, yard house is rated best of them all. i haven't tried them all but i can definitely say yard house is the best i've had yet.\n\ni went with a group of four on a late tuesday afternoon. they weren't busy or crowded but i have seen the line pour out the door enough times to know i was lucky. we were promptly sat down just time to enjoy the happy hour menu. we ordered their famous tower of onion rings while we sifted through the massive menu. i ordered the <mark>Gardein Bbq Chicken Salad</mark> with a cup of <mark>Grilled Cheese & <mark><mark><mark>Organic Tomato Bisque</mark></mark></mark></mark> soup. the other members of my party ordered the barbeque <mark>Gardein Bbq Chicken Salad</mark> with a cup of <mark><mark>Gardein Blackened Chicken Torta</mark></mark> soup, pastrami sandwich, and a mushroom burger. \n\nwhen the <mark>Onion Ring Tower</mark> arrived it instantly lived up to the expectations. thin, lightly battered, crispy onion rings sprinkled with parmesan cheese and served with ranch and chipotle ranch. they bursted with flavor to die for. at first the tower seems so incredibly large but when you finish the memory feels small in hindsight. my soup and salad was good with a pleasant, creamy, rich ranch dressing and well-seasoned <mark>Grilled Cheese & <mark><mark><mark>Organic Tomato Bisque</mark></mark></mark></mark> soup. however, it paled in comparison to the nothing short of perfect, <mark><mark>Gardein Blackened Chicken Torta</mark></mark> soup. i have never had a <mark>Chicken Tortilla Soup</mark> so creamy and flavorful. they put a large piece of avocado in the cup along with the crispy tortilla strips and large chunks of chicken. together, they blend to create a truly wonderful and hearty cup of soup. i had a bite of the barbeque <mark>Gardein Bbq Chicken Salad</mark> and while it was a bit too saucy for my tastes, the barbeque dressing wasn't overpowering and went well with the large pile of onion strings atop the salad. the pastrami sandwich looked great and the burger looked even better. the burger bun instantly caught my eye with a smooth crisp surface devoid of any grease or sheen. next time i will surely try a burger. \n\nthe town square location is large and wide open. the lighting is dim and creates a hip vibe that went well with the modern menu. everyone in my group had a few questions about the menu and the server was friendly, knowledgeable, and willing to help. the prices however are a bit steep and you might want to arrive early to take advantage of the happy hour choices. one specific item that caught my eye was the 17 dollar macaroni and cheese. it looked delicious but it would have to be at that price.\n\nin the end i walked away satisfied and yearning to return to try a burger or maybe even that posh mac and cheese entree.", 
            "easily the best place to eat in ts without spending tons of money (ahem, texas de brazil). \n\nlove, love, love the food here! actually, i need to amend that. i've had the same entree every time i've gone to the yardhouse. every time. it's that good. the <mark>Pan Seared Ahi</mark> <mark>New York Steak Sandwich</mark>. the fish is always excellent quality and very fresh. onions caramelized to melt-in-my-mouth goodness. and the garlic aioli...i'd take a bath in it if i could. \n\nanyway, everyone else i've gone with says the other entrees are also delicious. the appetizers are pretty tasty, notably the <mark>Grilled Artichoke</mark>. the <mark>Onion Ring Tower</mark> is also worth a try! the house brews are really good. can't say anything about dessert, as i've always been too full from dinner and beer to smash more food into my belly. \n\nthis is one of those places that gets very crowded, so be prepared for a wait. obviously, if you're flexible about where you sit, you sit faster. fyi: they keep the patio tables open during the winter, but they pull down canvas \"walls\" and crank up space heaters to keep the warm in and cold out, so don't immediately pass up the patio when it's chilly!\n\nthe service is nothing special, but is also not terrible. they also play sports on the tvs, if you're into that sort of thing ;)\n\nyardhouse is another staple!", 
            "not sure what's more embarrassing: the fact that the other day before going to see the master at rave (two thumbs up!) that i spent $120 on dinner for 2 at yard house, or the fact that i thought it was worth every penny.  this is not to say that the average opinion on the yardhouse is low, but i do think it's typically thought of as a place to grab some cheap happy hour appetizers and some beer and not a place to spend $30 on entrees.  well i did that, and i was damn happy with the results.\n\nwe arrived shortly before happy hour ended and i started with a black and tan and we also ordered the seared <mark>Ahi Sashimi </mark> appetizer which i was pleasantly surprised to find half off on the happy hour menu (which also discounted the price on the beer a bit).   i've had the ahi appetizer here several times and it's almost always a winner.  i'll venture to say it's the best of it's kind among chain restaurants.  for entrees my dining partner got the <mark>Pepper Crusted Filet</mark> mignon and i ordered the <mark>Ginger Crusted Norwegian Salmon</mark>.   both were accompanied with wasabi mashed potatoes which i've always enjoyed for that slight hint of wasabi in every bite.  my salmon was a little masked with all the toppings (namely carrot strings, the ginger crust, and the sesame vinaigrette).   usually i would find this to be a negative, but i''ll be damned if all of the ingredients really work together here.  i've been known to sneak a bite of the salmon on it's own from time to time anyhow and found it to be nicely cooked.\n\nthe one issue with the entire meal was the filet which was ordered medium was a little inconsistently cooked.  some of it seemed cooked medium well (little to no pink) while some of it did seem cooked as ordered.  i was able to taste a little of both sections and found them both tasty, though the one with some pink was more to my liking.  \n\nservice was great throughout and we ordered several jack and cokes once happy hour ended and they were constantly being refreshed.  when we informed the waitress we had a movie to make she made sure to bring the check to us quickly.  when the check first arrived i was slightly taken aback by the price (and the amount of alcohol we'd consumed), but realized it had been worth it.  it also made me appreciate that i could go into the yardhouse and make a choice on whether to have a great $30 experience of a couple of drinks, an <mark>Onion Ring Tower</mark> and a sandwich, or go all out and have a great steak or piece of fish for extra.  you can't do that (or much of anything else) at applebee's folks!  \n\nlater on in the theater while everyone else was fleeing for the exit midway through, we sat content.  i initially blamed this on poor movie taste by the others, but in retrospect perhaps it was the contentedness of the meal beforehand that transferred over to our cinema experience.", 
            "i admit it, i'm a yard house whore. \n\ni seriously love this place. the restaurant has such a chill and laid back vibe. it's huge and has ample seating. they have nice cushiony booths so if you and a date come by then you can have a semi-romantic dinner on one of those. want to sit outside? they have a nice patio area in which they have heaters for the chillier days. they have tvs all over the place with different channels. games are on most of the time. if you want to watch a specific game on a specific tv, all you have to do is ask.\n\ni'm not a big beer person. but yard house is the one place i will indulge in a glass (or two...or three...). my favorite beer is the lindeman's framboise. a belgian lambic beer, it has the perfect cidery raspberry taste. they serve it in some sort of champagne glass - it makes me want to pinky up because i feel almost sophisticated drinking it! i also love their fruit ciders, especially their pear cider. the snakebite is also divine - it's a blend of the pear cider and harp. besides their beer, they have pretty good specialty mixed drinks. one that comes to mind is their pomegranate margarita. tart and pomegranite-y with a pretty presentation!\n\ntheir food awesome! my faves are listed below:\n\n[before i list specific food items, i'd like to say that yard house has really really good fries. they're super thin and super addicting. if you're into the thick cut steak fries, you won't find them here]\n\nappetizers\n- seared <mark>Ahi Sashimi </mark>: about 6 pieces of seared tuna covered in soy vinaigrette is served next to a small bed of red cabbage also covered in the vinaigrette. i really like this dish when it's made right. sometimes they over-drench the sashimi pieces and the dish becomes ultra salty.\n- <mark>Onion Ring Tower</mark>: literally, the name says it all. it's apparently beer battered and comes with a chipotle ketchup and ranch dressing. \n- <mark>Spicy Tuna Roll</mark>: if you're expecting a typical sushi roll, then don't. this is served without rice and as a stack. bottom layer are edamame and cucumbers. middle layer is your tuna and the top layer is the avocado. it's a pretty dish. very innovative. \n- sliders: specifically the bearnaise or ahi sliders. four sliders plus a handful of fries. they call this an appetizer, but the portions are not appetizer-like!\n\nentree\n- mac & cheese squared: chicken, bacon, mushrooms, truffle oil. can't go wrong with this one. they use wild mushrooms that elevated your boring mac & cheese to the next level. \n[this is it for entrees. i usually stick with their appetizers.]\n\ndessert\n- chocolate souffle: small souffle good for one. scoop of vanilla ice cream on top with mint garnish. do not leave without trying this. i'm seriously serious. \n\nyard house has great happy hour. 3 pm - 6 pm monday - friday and 10 pm - close sunday - thursday. drink specials and half off on a lot of their appetizers! their sliders are discounted as well. perfect late night meal.", 
            "how have i not reviewed yard house yet?! it's been a while since i've eaten here (usually we just come for beer) so we decided to stop by yesterday for happy hour, which is mon thru fri 3 to 6 pm. happy hour features half priced appetizers, $2 off glasses of wine, and $4-5 beer. since i never know what kind of beer to get, i looked at the menu until something sounded good...ok, i'll have a spaten oktoberfest...isn't this beer only seasonal though? \n\nwe ordered some appetizers to share: <mark>Onion Ring Tower</mark>, <mark>Spicy Tuna Roll</mark>, bernaise sliders w/ fries, and chicken <mark>Lettuce Wraps</mark>. our favorite were the <mark>Lettuce Wraps</mark>, where the chicken was perfectly cooked and the sauces provided went well with it, especially the sweet and sour that had a little kick to it. the onion rings were a little over cooked and brown/over crispy but were still ok, especially when dipped in ranch. the sliders are always delicious, topped with fried onion strings and 1 of my favorite items on their menu. i didn't have the <mark>Spicy Tuna Roll</mark> since i don't eat fish so i can't comment on that dish.\n\nyard house is one of my favorite places to grab a drink or hang with friends, especially this one since it's located right in town square and near the movie theater, making it a good place to drink before catching a movie. they also have a large number of tvs, so it's a good place to catch a game although i'm never on this side of town on football sundays...they also have plenty of patio seating which is perfect on those spring and summer nights",

            "fun place to go for drinks and good times with friends!  i agree that the happy hour from 3-6 pm is definitely pretty sweet.  can't go wrong with 1/2 on appetizers and drinks.  for appetizers, we tried the onion rings, <mark><mark>California Roll</mark></mark>, <mark><mark>Gardein Fried Chicken Strips</mark></mark>, <mark>Fried Calamari</mark>, <mark>Spicy Tuna Roll</mark>, and <mark>Blue Crab Cakes</mark>.  onion rings, <mark>Fried Calamari</mark>, and <mark>Blue Crab Cakes</mark> were all nice & crispy.  <mark><mark>Gardein Fried Chicken Strips</mark></mark> came with fries and were good as well, but nothing out of the ordinary.  the <mark><mark>California Roll</mark></mark> and <mark>Spicy Tuna Roll</mark> were interesting, in that their presentation was unlike that of those you see in a sushi restaurant.  they actually came as one huge, cut sushi piece, kind of like a cake or a tart.  the presentation was pretty unique, but the taste was also good but nothing really special.  if i was really craving sushi, i'd probably go check out normal sushi places like osaka, sushi club, or something along those lines.  for drinks, i've tried the mangolicious martini, the malibu peach martini, blue moon beer, and wyder's raspberry cider.  i'm usually not a huge beer drinker, but the wyder's was good...nice raspberry taste! of course, looove the martinis!  and to top it all off, we all shared a kona coffee ice cream sundae, which was to die for!!! i would definitely be hitting up yard house a lot for happy hour with different groups of friends in the future.", 
            "this is always a convenient spot to drop by at town square for happy hour or a drink to cool yourself down from walking around town square in 100f+, or while you're waiting to watch a movie.\n\ni like that they have framboise on tap and i'm a fan of that.  the half price happy hour items feature their regular appetizers that come in full portion.  the tuna tartare stack or <mark><mark>California Roll</mark></mark> (a stack of avacado, edamame and raw spicy tuna) are great.  their <mark>Spicy Thai Chicken</mark> pizza is a great beer food item.  <mark>Chicken Nachos</mark> is also good if you can handle the portion.\n\ni used to go to blue martini upstairs a lot more but since they changed the menu yardhouse just became a better choice.", 
            "***disclaimer - really long review in regards to late night happy hour not being honored on st. patrick's day\n\ncame to yard house at town square to celebrate my birthday with my husband and i was very excited to order quite a bit of things on the menu, both food and drink.  however, i was very disappointed to find out that happy hour was not being honored.  my birthday is on st patricks day and the server informed me that there was no happy hour because it was a holiday.  i informed the server that it's not a national holiday and there happy hour policy on their menu does not state that holidays are not included.  we were not informed when we entered the restaurant that there was no happy hour.  we were also not informed when we were seated and our first orders were taken that there was no happy hour.  if my husband had not inquired if a certain beer was on the happy hour menu, i believe we would not have been informed that happy hour was not being honored.  \n\nmy evening was ruined because there was no happy hour.  i did not want to order as many items as i would have liked because there was no happy hour.  my husband did not want to cause a scene that evening so i did not ask for a manager that night.  \n\nthe food that we did order was good for the most part, but it wasn't great.  we ordered the spicy tuna and <mark><mark>California Roll</mark></mark>.  the spicy tuna was good but the <mark><mark>California Roll</mark></mark>'s rice was hard and undercooked.  the hummus lacked flavor.  the only really good thing i ate was the jamaican jerk wings.  \n\nthe next day i called other yard house's in las vegas and the one at red rock informed me that they honor happy hour on holidays, it just depended on which holiday.  they said it was at the manager's discretion.  they said that they had happy hour but only from 3 p.m. - 6 p.m. and not the late night happy hour.  i also called blue martini, mcfaddens, and buffalo wild wings who said they had happy hour on st. patricks day.  \n\ni then called the yard house at town square and asked to speak to a manager.  i spoke to leo and he informed me that the policy for no happy hour came from corporate.  he informed me that customers were being informed at the door that there was no happy hour and i informed him that was not the case with us.  he explained there was nothing he could do for me because corporate sent that policy.  he informed me that no yard house in the country had late night happy hour on st. patrick's day.  i asked him for the number to corporate and thanked the manager for his time.  \n\ni then called four other yard houses in the country and three out of the four said they had happy hour both early and late, even though it was st. patrick's day.  i contacted corporate and left a message since it was after hours.  i waited 2 days but heard nothing back.  i called corporate again on friday, march 21 and spoke to customer service who researched the information for me.  he was first unaware of the policy so he said he would contact the yard house in town square and give me a call back.  after calling back he informed me that there may have been some miscommunication and that he was new and that is why he may not have heard of the happy hour policy for st. patrick's day.  he asked if the manager at yard house did anything for me and i informed him that he did not.  in the end, he said he would do more research and send me some gift certificates in the mail.  \n\nas of 3/28/14.  i have not received them but he did say they would take approximately 7-10 business days.\n\nall in all, i was just very disappointed with the way they went about the happy hour policy.  they should have made a sign out front or placed a note on the menu, or trained all staff to inform everyone before they were seated.", 
            "great beer and even cocktails menus. love leinenkugel sunset wheat, sam adams cherry wheat or ruby red cocktail. hard to pick a winner. i've heard the new beer cocktails are \"weird\" so haven't tried those.\n\nservice is usually good. the servers attitudes are sometimes better than the food runners. i've had plates slung at me...i laughed it off on all accounts, it's a tough job, i get it. they try to keep drinks filled, sometimes they succeed. better at keeping the alcohol flowing than the water, if you get my drift aka $$. \n\nsome of my family's favorites are chicken fingers (kids menu), their fries, <mark>Spicy Tuna Roll</mark> & <mark><mark>California Roll</mark></mark> (two of my faves), seared <mark>Ahi Sashimi </mark>, pastrami sliders & the chicken <mark>Lettuce Wraps</mark>. mac n cheese is amazing, but i usually allow myself to order it once a year- it's so rich. also, loved the lobster garlic noodle; it's a special occasion dish, too! any of their salads are good. the gorgonzola dressing is great. skip their pizzas. \n\ncheck their hh special before you go.\n\noverall, i am especially fond of the vibe, the layout/lighting & decor, and their great playlist. service and food are good enough and the drinks are great!", 
            "best happy hour around. try the <mark><mark>California Roll</mark></mark> poke style. not a fan of the <mark>Rib Eye</mark>. a little on the small side and over cooked. the chocolate suffe is excellent though. also try to order beers that are on the popular side as the ones that sit in the draft lines get flat.", 
            "5 stars goes tooooo...happy hour.\n\nmy friends and i can't get enough of yard house's happy hour. they serve delicious food and for a great price! their servings are pretty big! i always go to happy hour with a group of friends and we all end up sharing everything at the table. \n\nbuffalo chicken wings- yummy, tasty, and has a little kick! served with celery sticks and ranch.\nchicken <mark>Lettuce Wraps</mark>- healthy and crunchy. they give you about 5 or 6 lettuce cups and three different sauces. so the flavor choice is all up to you!\n<mark><mark>California Roll</mark></mark>- don't be fooled by it being just \"one\" <mark><mark>California Roll</mark></mark>, but it's huge. it's a jumbo <mark><mark>California Roll</mark></mark>!\ncalamari- crispy and cooked perfectly! squeeze some lemons and dip it in the spicy tomato sauce and it is to die for.\n<mark>Spinach Cheese Dip</mark>- delicious!! comes with chips. and it's a lot.\n<mark>Classic Sliders</mark>- comes with 4 mini sliders. they give you mustard and ketchup bottles. it comes with a pickle slice and fries. the fries are skinny, crispy, and leave you wanting more!\nahi poke- though it could be a little bigger of a portion, it's really tasty.\n<mark>Onion Ring Tower</mark>- they stack a huge tower of onions, fresh to eat!\n\ni've been coming to yard house forever now and they always have great service and good quality food for their prices.", 
            "i love the yard house. the ahi tuna poke, <mark>Coconut Shrimp</mark>, and macaroni and cheese are my absolute favorites. they also have the <mark><mark>California Roll</mark></mark> type sushi appetizer that is as big as a regular meal - and delicious! \n\nthis time though, something seemed off. there was an extended wait, even though the restaraunt was not super busy and plenty of tables were open. when we finally were seated, drinks came promptly, and then we didn't see waitstaff for about 20 minutes. when he finally came around i asked a few questions about the ahi tuna - i hadn't tried it before and i wanted to - the waiter was completely disinterested. maybe he was having a bad day...\n\nour food came, and it was good, but not the same. i'm not sure if they have changed recipes, but it was kind of lackluster (considering most of their food is pretty amazing usually). i tried the tuna, and it was tasty, but warm which is a no no for sushi-related food. \n\ni hope to be able to return one day, but i was disappointed significantly by this visit, which is kind of upsetting.", 
            "went here last night for dinner to try again after my last visit. i have to say the service was prompt and our drinks came out almost immediately. tim was our waiter first (then it changed to heather later in the evening). \n\ni ordered the <mark><mark>California Roll</mark></mark> for an appetizer, and it was superb. the food took a little time to come out, but honestly the place was packed so i understand.\n\nfor dinner we ordered the mac and cheese and the applewood smoked bacon burger. both entrees were piping hot, and delicious, which satisfied my disappointment over my last visit. heather took great care of us, and because of her i will be back.", 
            "i love coming here during happy hours. the food is delicious! it's not good enough to be paid for full price but definitely worth when it's half off lol \nso we got the <mark>Chicken Nachos</mark>, <mark><mark>Queso Dip</mark></mark>, chicken wings, <mark>Spicy Tuna Roll</mark> and <mark><mark>California Roll</mark></mark>. the california is a big giant roll. it's not like a traditional roll. it's just one big roll. the rice was under cooked so we ask them to take it back but literally everything else was great. best buffalo sauce ever! i especially loved the wings because i'm a chicken person lol \nthey have great quality fish for their <mark>Spicy Tuna Roll</mark>, they use ahi fish instead tuna bc it's a better fish i guess. \nthe <mark>Chicken Nachos</mark> is huge, you can check the picture, one order of <mark>Chicken Nachos</mark> is enough to share with your whole party. it's ginormous. \ntheir <mark><mark>Queso Dip</mark></mark> was really really good. the cheese was a bit spicy, for white people, but it was delicious for me. haha \nour server, mike, was really friendly and helpful. \nthe only thing that i think would be a concern for some people is the loud noise. but then again people only come here for the loudness. lol bc they have like a million tv in here with sports turned on. haha \nanyway, i hope you enjoy it and hopefully this helped. :)", 
            "well, i usually go there to order two things, the blacken pepper gonzola burger or <mark>Chicken <mark>Shiitake <mark>Lobster Garlic Noodles</mark></mark></mark> excellent! but this time i went during happy hour and they had great presentation on food, but my son and i were not thrilled on the <mark><mark>California Roll</mark></mark>. the rice was mushy, and there wasn't much seaweed on it. i took a photo and you can see for yourself. other than that, the service was great. i just wouldn't recommend that <mark><mark>California Roll</mark></mark>."

            "this was our first time at yard house and maybe my expectations were higher than they should've been.  the place reminded me a lot of bj's restaurant, although this place had more of a different twist to their menu.  they also serve a ton of beer!  the display of all of the beer kegs right when you enter is quite impressive!  since i'm not much of a beer drinker, i opted for the fruitier belgian drink called the lindeman's framboise.  it's seriously an alcoholic juice...very dangerous!  \n\nas for food, i think our eyes were hungrier than our stomachs!  we ordered the <mark>Truffle Fries</mark> (shredded parmesan and herbs) with a hint of garlic.  it was delish!  then we ordered the <mark>Ahi Poke Bowl </mark> with some fried wontons that were also quite tasty.  then we ordered pastrami sliders which did not meet my standards.  i have had better <mark>Pastrami Benedict Burger</mark> and this one was on the salty side.  the hubby also ordered <mark>Moo Shu Egg Rolls</mark> (no good) and chinese <mark>Chicken <mark>Shiitake <mark>Lobster Garlic Noodles</mark></mark></mark>.  maybe i was delusional to think that the <mark>Chicken <mark>Shiitake <mark>Lobster Garlic Noodles</mark></mark></mark> would come close to thanh long's.  \n\nall in all, if you want lots of beer variety and a good atmosphere, then this place is for you.  just don't expect them to excel in the food department.", 
            "i've been here a couple times before, but once i turned 21 this has been one of my go-to spots for happy hour because the specials are amazing! the fact that they have mini take home happy hour menus makes it all the more tempting as well. \n\nallow me break it down for you:\nhappy hour is mon-fri 3pm-6pm, sun-wed 10pm-close\n\ndomestic pints - $3.50, craft&import pints - $4.25-$4.75\nsliders served on a bed of fries  ($6.75): classic, bearnaise, pastrami, turkey, veggie. ahi is $9.95\n\nhalf priced pizzas: <mark><mark>Bbq Chicken</mark></mark>, 4cheese, ham & pineapple, margherita, pepperoni & mushroom, <mark>Spicy Thai Chicken</mark>\n\nhalf priced apps: <mark>Blue Crab Cakes</mark>, calamari, cali roll, chinese <mark>Chicken <mark>Shiitake <mark>Lobster Garlic Noodles</mark></mark></mark>, <mark>Chicken Nachos</mark>, <mark>Onion Ring Tower</mark>, wings, boneless wings, veggie wings, hawaiian <mark>Poke Stack</mark>, <mark>Spicy Tuna Roll</mark>, seared <mark>Ahi Sashimi </mark>, chicken <mark>Lettuce Wraps</mark>, <mark><mark>Gardein Fried Chicken Strips</mark></mark>, <mark>Spinach Cheese Dip</mark>, <mark>Moo Shu Egg Rolls</mark>\n\ndoesn't that just blow your mind? it's like a plethora of cheap happy hour eats and you'll probably get full off of one order of sliders, or 2 of their apps. \n\nso far i've tried:\n-bearnaise sliders (bearnaise sauce and fried shoestring onions on the patty w/ a side of very skinny fries that are tenderly cooked with a very light batter coating which gives them a perfectly crunchy exterior and \"juicy\" inside)\n-<mark><mark>Bbq Chicken</mark></mark> and <mark>Margherita Pizza</mark> (they pretty much taste as they should. sometimes the <mark><mark>Bbq Chicken</mark></mark> is a little too saucy for my taste though)\n-calamari (yum. perfectly fried on the outside and melting on the inside. served w/ marinara and, i wanna say tartar sauce? i usually go with the red..)\n-traditional wings (first and last time i had these, they were so spicy! my bf couldn't even handle them and he claims to love hot stuff, hehe. the thing that i don't like about these wings is that you can't choose how spicy you want them, so you have to be prepared for whatever they give you)\n\neverything i've tried has been pretty good so far and there is still so much more i have yet to try! i know my boyfriend has been having some sort of frenzy over the happy hour <mark>Poke Stack</mark>. he's gone to this location about 4 times in the past month, by himself, just to sit and eat the <mark>Poke Stack</mark>, so i can only guess how delicious it must be. \n\nkey points:\n-happy hour is awesome here\n-traditional wings are hot!

            "birthday party on a budget.  happy hour half off appetizers and drinks after 10pm, say what?!\n\nlast night, i joined two of my friends at the yard house to celebrate one of their birthdays.  i've eaten at the yard house many o' times  and love the beer choices.  the experience/food is not the worst, but it's not the best.  it's great for happy hour and i'm sticking to that!\n\nfor drinks, i just got the fat tire pint for about $5.  although i appreciate the 130+ beer choices, i'm partial to my fat tire/newcastle beers.  for food, we got a few appetizers which were all half off:  first, the  jamaican jerk style boneless wings.  came with a sweet hoisin type dipping sauce. the chicken was tender and the batter was delightful.  next, we had <mark>Moo Shu Egg Rolls</mark>-chicken, chili cream cheese, carrots, green onions, cilantro, spinach with apple ginger plum sauce.  the chicken was a little dry but was redeemed with the sweet plum sauce.  lastly, we got the <mark>Chicken Nachos</mark>-spicy pinto beans, cheddar, jack, red & green sauce, tomato, cilantro, onions, guacamole, sour cream.  it's a huge serving, but just your average bar nachos.  the cheese was a little hard.\n\ni did appreciate the great service that night.  the manager came over a few times, because a drunk lady invited herself on our table and then asked for us to pay her bar tab.  she was a little loud but somewhat funny.  our server was cordial, but not to impressionable.  \n\nthe happy hour will continue bringing me back to the yard house.  it isn't busy and we got a table right away.  there's typically a younger crowd which offers a hip vibe in my opinion.  let's just say that overall, i wouldn't necessarily wait longer than 15 minutes for a table unless you're crazy about beer.",

            "what a great, great last time out in vegas.\n\ni was invited to a get together with some work folks and was accompanied by the ultimate gentleman.  i have fond memories of many of their locations (costa mesa, irvine, long beach and west palm beach) and it was always with a crowd, so this is one of those chain places where good times are guaranteed.  \n\nwe went for happy hour since the appetizers were half priced and pints were 3.25.  the beer selection is huge and my companion and i had a hard time in choosing something to start with.  one of the two servers taking care of our table suggested we get a \"pre-designed\" sampler.  this is when the bar selects six beers for you, rather than you choosing six, and they stay within a certain medium, such as pale ales, darks, etc.  we wanted something in the medium category.  \n\nthe sampler is something i totally recommend you do if you're undecided about what beer you'd like and you have someone to share with you.  we sipped each beer, rated them accordingly, and decided our top three, in order, were redhook esb, redhook blond, and fat tire's new belgium.  since the top two were the new belgium and the blond, we ordered pints of each and shared 'em.\n\nas for the appetizers, we picked up an order of the <mark><mark>Gardein Fried Chicken Strips</mark></mark> and hawaiian <mark>Poke Stack</mark>.  great choices (kinda hard to mess up <mark><mark>Gardein Fried Chicken Strips</mark></mark>, though); the poke was a pretty good portion for an appetizer and was tasty!  \n\nboth of the servers were outstanding in tending to our party of 14.  very attentive, didn't miss a beat, and were great about reminding everyone to get their last orders in before happy hour ended.  can't beat that!\n\nif only the yard house were in the dmv.....",

            "i was surprised that i haven't written a review for the yard house...weird. \n\nwell to sum it up, this latest visit to the yard house was for a close friends birthday dinner. i was only expecting five people or so, but she reserved almost 20 some-odd seats!!! so good to know that the yard house does take reservations in advance for such a huge party.  the party didn't start off as planned since the birthday girl was nearly two hours late for her own party!! lol. however, thank goodness for the large lcd tv screens plastered on every inch and corner of this place, we were able to kill the time, starting with some drinks and enjoying sunday night football at the same time...so it all didn't go to waste :) the beer selection is amazing! they dedicate a whole two pages of the menu just for the beer, i've also seen beer floats and i have yet to try one. if you don't want to spend full price on alcoholic beverages, they have happy hour from 10pm-close. \n\nthe yard house...its an interesting restaurant. the ambiance in this place is...well....amazing!? ha ha. it's weird, you sit there at your table and the lighting is dim and serene, yet at the same time, with the lcd screens and the bar smacked right in the middle of the restaurant, it's also like a pub! so...like a high class restaurant/pub/sports bar/lounge? does this make any sense? because i'm just typing away and totally going off subject..........\n\nfood! i usually start off with the calamari, the baby-squid type, not that o-ring type! yum yum....and my main dish is always the crab crusted swordfish on wasabi mashed potatoes. absolutely amazing! the swordfish is cooked just right, every time i have ordered this dish, and not once was the fish over cooked. its pretty pricey, $23.00 (give or take), but the portion is well worth your money! :) however this time i decided to try something else and a bit lighter. since i filled my body with a lot of alcohol for the night, something big would get me sick so i decided to order something small. so i figured an appetizer, that's small enough right? i ordered the ahi <mark>Poke Stack</mark> which was $11.95. ahi poke is cubed raw tuna tossed in a mix of soy sauce, sesame seed oil, onions, limu, green onions. i grew up on this stuff, so i was quite curious of the yard house's recipe. i was very satisfied. when i received my plate, first layer was ahi poke, then a layer of \"fried something\", next topped with seasoned sauteed carrots, another layer of  the fried \"crispy something\", topped with more poke. it was light, refreshing, and absolutely delish!!! the taste was just as amazing as its presentation. :) my new favorite dish! don't forget to finish off with the kona coffee sundae for dessert, it's quite big, so you can share with a friend or significant other! \n\nusually with big groups, taking orders could be tricky. it makes sense for a group of 14, to assign two waiters to take orders. after that experience, unless the two waiters can communicate good, its not a good idea. problems such as taking double orders (esp with drinks..) not cool! but it was all squared away with no problems. other than that the waiters were on their game and totally cool!", 
            "this has by far been one of the best happy hour menu's.  they have their sliders, pizza's, and popular appetizers at a low price.  well, if you bring a big group or if you're sharing for 2.  you can get about 3 to 4 dishes for almost $13.00.  \n\nthe atmosphere of this place is ok, if you like that fast paced and loud noise ambiance.  it's tolerable, and i have yet to experience bad service.  the servers are quick to get your order, great with drink refills, and the food comes out in less than 20 mins.  (*quick note: never eat here, not unless it's happy hour, otherwise you'd be paying $10 - $15 for appetizers and entree's*) \n\nthings to order:  \n- chicken lettuce wrap - ground chicken sauteed with diced mushrooms, onion leaves, and spices, served upon a fried wonton bowl accompanied with 8-9 <mark>Lettuce Wraps</mark>.  there are three types of sauces, i think regular, mild and spicy?  i'm not too sure on that, but the regular sauce is my favorite.  \n\n- <mark>Fried Calamari</mark> - nothing too special, but a definite must have for a vast mix.  the calamari is always fried to a crisp, tossed in a salt a pepper mix served with tartar sauce and a marinara sauce i think?  \n\n- hawaiian <mark>Poke Stack</mark> - for some reason the fish tastes very fresh, as opposed to other restaurants who try their hardest to execute a poke dish.  yardhouse i'd say, prepares it well.  ahi poke tossed in a hawaiian style marinade, served upon two wonton crisps with soy & sesame oil bean sprouts and carrots.  \n\n- onion ring stack - an <mark>Onion Ring Tower</mark> served with two types of sauces: ranch and chipotle.  i personally like the chipotle sauce.  the onion rings are fried to perfection, the onions doesn't slip out of the fried batter.  \n\n- <mark>Chicken Nachos</mark> - mmmmmm, a huge plate of nachos served with the toppings of a mexican nacho.  the cheese sizzles when served and the chicken is quite succulent, although the pieces should be chopped up a little more.  \n\n- <mark>Spinach Cheese Dip</mark> - my very favorite, spinach and cheese mixed together in a hot mix (not spicy).  served with largely cut toasted bread instead of chips!  what's even better, they lightly top the bread with parmesan! \n\nthis a definite must go to if you're having a get together.  the food is good, and so is the experience.  another pro to this, is that after eating you can go watch a movie.  since the movie theatre is in fact right across the building.", 
            "got some disappointing news so my man decided to cheer me up with an evening at yard house. as usual we sat at the bar (its where the most chill and fun people sit ...my kind of people) and we were greeted quick as lightning by nick. he was very nice and got us our beer (i chose my usual pyramid apricot ale....great girl beer...and my man switched it up and got a murphy's stout). the evening was looking up. \n\non the menu they have amazing mac n' cheese squared. it has pasta that looks kinda like a combination of girl's and guy's junk...and makes me laugh....throw on some bacon, mushrooms, chicken, and a plethora of cheese and you have a fantastic dish. i wasn't quite feeling that on this somewhat somber evening so i opted for the hawaiian <mark>Poke Stack</mark> and my man got his favorite bernaise burger. it was cooked perfectly and quite delicious. \n\ni wanted to throw caution to the wind and try a new beer. i asked kristen to point me in the right direction. she gave me a tangerine white ale (i think) and was very knowledgeable about all the beers. unfortunately, the tangerine beer didn't agree with my taste buds. i informed kristen of this and she couldn't have been nicer, cooler or more apologetic about it (super professional). it truly was not a big deal to me for i just went back to my usual beer. \n\nmy night got waaaay better thanks mostly to my wonderful man but i must say yard house helped out the situation lots and lots. will be back for mac n' cheese soon :)", 
            "april 3rd, 2011 (10pm happy hour)\n\nordered:\ntraditional wings\nbernaise sliders\n<mark><mark>Bbq Chicken</mark></mark> pizza\n\npros:\n * good happy hour menu selections (including brews)\n * decent sized portions\n * lively atmosphere \n\ncons:\n * super packed\n * slow service\n * expensive for happy hour (food)\n\ntips:\n* new on the menu : ahi sliders !\n* order your water with lemon to help cleanse you of that food smell after grubbing on finger foods. it's a natural antibacterial cleanser.\n* scan life avail. for those with smartphones... its on their coasters !!\n\n  okay, this place is another one of those places where service is not really a concern.  service was a bit slow, but what do you expect from such a busy place during happy hour?  the food is good, especially the bernaise sliders (comes with fries).  i found it disappointing that there i wasn't asked how hot i wanted my wings.  i guess i've been spoiled with buffalo wild wings.  i didn't get a chance to sample the pizza, but my friend ate up every last piece and had no complaints.  happy hour selection is pretty broad.  the prices are a bit higher than most happy hour menus, but the portions make up for it.  other choices include ahi <mark>Poke Stack</mark>, domestic pints for $3.50, and calamari.  a great place for late night eats with friends/co-workers. i'll be back for more for sure!", 
            "undoubtedly one of the best happy hour specials in las vegas, when considering quality and price. sure, you can go to the neighborhood bar and find $1 beers on tap at odd hours...but the quality offered by yard house is seldom seen in combination with their prices. expect to pay $4-5 for a delicious imported beer, $4 wells, or $5-6 for one of their signature martinis and cocktails. \n\non top of that, their food is delicious. and by delicious, i mean i've never eaten anything there that wasn't. generously portioned half priced appetizers will undoubtedly keep you satiated to the tune of $6-7, or you can enjoy their sliders or pizza selection for similar pricing. \n\ni rang in my 21st birthday here in 2009, and my friends had a blast exposing me to all sorts of fun delicious drinks - i can give yard house some credit for the eclectic taste in spirits i have now. take me seriously when i say, they have beer for everyone. if you hate beer, they have beer for you. if you love beer, they have 250 of them! if you think beer is tolerable but haven't found one you love yet, get in your car *right now* and go to yard house. i'm serious. my personal favorites are goose island matilda, a belgian style pale ale that tastes a little bit fruity with a lot of kick, and stone ruination ipa. they always card - always - which i also enjoy ;)\n\nthe reason they lose a star isn't even really their fault, but it does deserve to be said - cell phone service is rare. i've received many angry text messages and voicemails after being unreachable for the few hours i spent enjoying my goose island matilda and ahi <mark>Poke Stack</mark>. no bueno. however, although yard house doesn't provide wifi as stated on this page, town square does and i have been known to bring my laptop with me for a working lunch here. \n\nwith both afternoon and late night happy hours - you can't lose. unless you hate food and alcohol and prefer to live in a cave chewing on cardboard. in that place, you should probably get off yelp.", 
            "i've been here a couple times before, but once i turned 21 this has been one of my go-to spots for happy hour because the specials are amazing! the fact that they have mini take home happy hour menus makes it all the more tempting as well. \n\nallow me break it down for you:\nhappy hour is mon-fri 3pm-6pm, sun-wed 10pm-close\n\ndomestic pints - $3.50, craft&import pints - $4.25-$4.75\nsliders served on a bed of fries  ($6.75): classic, bearnaise, pastrami, turkey, veggie. ahi is $9.95\n\nhalf priced pizzas: <mark><mark>Bbq Chicken</mark></mark>, 4cheese, ham & pineapple, margherita, pepperoni & mushroom, <mark>Spicy Thai Chicken</mark>\n\nhalf priced apps: <mark>Blue Crab Cakes</mark>, calamari, cali roll, chinese <mark>Chicken <mark>Shiitake <mark>Lobster Garlic Noodles</mark></mark></mark>, <mark>Chicken Nachos</mark>, <mark>Onion Ring Tower</mark>, wings, boneless wings, veggie wings, hawaiian <mark>Poke Stack</mark>, <mark>Spicy Tuna Roll</mark>, seared <mark>Ahi Sashimi </mark>, chicken <mark>Lettuce Wraps</mark>, <mark><mark>Gardein Fried Chicken Strips</mark></mark>, <mark>Spinach Cheese Dip</mark>, <mark>Moo Shu Egg Rolls</mark>\n\ndoesn't that just blow your mind? it's like a plethora of cheap happy hour eats and you'll probably get full off of one order of sliders, or 2 of their apps. \n\nso far i've tried:\n-bearnaise sliders (bearnaise sauce and fried shoestring onions on the patty w/ a side of very skinny fries that are tenderly cooked with a very light batter coating which gives them a perfectly crunchy exterior and \"juicy\" inside)\n-<mark><mark>Bbq Chicken</mark></mark> and <mark>Margherita Pizza</mark> (they pretty much taste as they should. sometimes the <mark><mark>Bbq Chicken</mark></mark> is a little too saucy for my taste though)\n-calamari (yum. perfectly fried on the outside and melting on the inside. served w/ marinara and, i wanna say tartar sauce? i usually go with the red..)\n-traditional wings (first and last time i had these, they were so spicy! my bf couldn't even handle them and he claims to love hot stuff, hehe. the thing that i don't like about these wings is that you can't choose how spicy you want them, so you have to be prepared for whatever they give you)\n\neverything i've tried has been pretty good so far and there is still so much more i have yet to try! i know my boyfriend has been having some sort of frenzy over the happy hour <mark>Poke Stack</mark>. he's gone to this location about 4 times in the past month, by himself, just to sit and eat the <mark>Poke Stack</mark>, so i can only guess how delicious it must be. \n\nkey points:\n-happy hour is awesome here\n-traditional wings are hot! (at least for me)\n-calamari is delectable\n-french fries are close to perfect\n-great for groups\n-service has been pretty fast on the days that i've gone",

            "meeting up with a friend at yard house was a very good idea. it was a great idea to do before the soft opening of the container store. i was afraid they would not have many \"apps\" and \"small bites\" at the opening, so i figured yard house would be a good place to grab something to eat, after all they do have a happy hour! \n\ni began with a riesling, nothing special, but definitely on the hh menu, so the price made me happy at only $5.25 for a glass. after my friend joined me we decided to order our food. \n\nfood\n\ni had the the hawaiian <mark>Poke Stack</mark>, after recommendations from my friend and the bartender. omg. mouth-gasm! i am so sad i have been missing out on this dish because it was freaking amazing! in fact, i am sad i have been missing out on poke period. basically the dish consists of marinated raw ahi with crispy wontons, carrots, bean sprouts, avocado, wasabi soy sauce. i seriously probably would have eaten another one had we not been going to the opening of the container store. i highly recommend this dish.\n\ndrinks\n\ni had a riesling and then went on to try the hypnotini. also a recommend from my friend and let me tell you, if you're going to get anything that is not beer at yard house, you should get one of these drinks. also, if you're a light weight - this is the only drink you'll need. after i had this and a glass of wine i was delightfully buzzed. \n\nservice\n\nwe were seated at the bar, so our service came from the bartenders. they were quick to ask if we wanted more drinks and carefully laid out our spread for our food. i think the service was pretty awesome.\n\noverall\n\ni am upping my review previously from 3 stars to 4 stars. i still believe yh's prices on certain dishes to be a bit pricey, but honestly you can't go wrong with their happy hour.", 
            "i've been to yardhouse several times. i like that they have so much beer on tap. my wife enjoys the rose gaarden (a mix of framboise and hoegaarden that is really honestly delicious) and i usually go with the rogue hazelnut brown.\n\nthe food has always been solid. the (mac + cheese)^2 is usually good, the hawaiian <mark>Poke Stack</mark> is always tasty (their tuna in general is pretty nice), and they can cook a good burger. so why the three stars? \n\nwell, we brought some guests here and found ourselves sort of embarrassed. to be fair, it was a saturday night and they were very, very busy, but our waiter (ryan) stood out as rude enough that our guests actually commented on it afterwards.\n\nlest you think i'm being unfair, here's specifically what went wrong, in order.\n\nwe had a party of six and were seated at a round table set for five. the host said he'd have us an extra chair in \"just a second,\" after which i saw him speak to our waiter. our waiter looked at us and then, presumably, went off to find a chair. i stood there, waiting, for five minutes while i saw our waiter serve drinks and food to other tables, patiently waiting for my chair. i finally had to flag him down and ask for a chair, again, before i got one. this kind of set the tone for the evening, but i didn't know it at the time.\n\nfinally sitting, we ordered drinks. one of our guests ordered a framboise. that's pronounced \"fram-bwahs\" due to the final e. this is important in a second, so hold on. our waiter replied \"that's framb-wah.\" my wife, looking embarrassed that our waiter had just corrected our guest, told him that no, it's pronounced fram-bwahs. i know this sounds like a silly thing, but \n\n1. she's right, and\n2. she's had people try to mansplain at her that she's wrong before, which is exactly what this dude was doing. \n3. furthermore, in what universe does a waiter correct a guest's pronunciation, even if they are wrong (which she wasn't)?\n\nour waiter gave her kind of a funny look when she said that. okay, maybe he's just tired or just had a rude table or something. not going to let it bother me.\n\nhold on, because this is where it gets weird.\n\nthat's when he started blowing us off. we had to ask for silverware twice after our food showed up and sat there, cooling, with us unable to eat it. he passed our table six times (six times! yes, i counted!) without even offering to refill our drinks until i finally had to flag him down. when he did bring refills, he brought them for everyone except my wife.\n\nexplain that. i'll wait.\n\nlook, bottom line, i'm still going to go to yardhouse. in fact, we went back a couple of days after, if only to wash the bad taste out of our mouths. i'm not going to let this one dude ruin it for me. but if i get sat in his section again, i'm going to ask to be moved.", 
            "it been while but had my cousin and her husband in town from sac. i thinking of good place too go hang out have some good food, good beer, television around watch game, and not loud can hang out talk stories catch up. yard house would be the perfect place although it can be loud. i went on tuesday night so not so bad plus ended up sitting outside on the outdoor cover patio area. it worked out great! =)\n\ni checked in too my surprise the wait was not very long got buzzed less then ten mins. just first glance the place was packed that night. the server she was great about being patience since cousin guys running late. the first things i love about the yh but at the same time frustrating figure out beer too start the night, the list is so long if there something that not find or something similar too likely would be very surprised. i went with the kona brewery fire rock ale. i love my kona brewery not only because from hawaii but good beer! the most common one see is longboard so saw another one on tap! hell yay! the rest of the night went with another my favorite firestone pale ale. it another one that hardly see on tap at bars. i love there beer still have since visited firestone winery. \n\nthe food was good as always! it been while but remember the hawaiian <mark>Poke Stack</mark> stood out for me. poke never go wrong in life. i love the way everything balances together. the poke nice and fresh soy style poke. the crispy wonton that adds little crispy fried texture plus works out great scoop up all the poke. the vegetable gives it more depth and flavors too the dish. the wasabi soy drizzle around nice accent too the whole dish. it daunting looking at it start height. once break down all good stuff. the second app had the bearnaise slider. honestly not really big fan. i asked the server she recommend as second app. it more miss then hit. the slider meat itself nothing special little dry side. the bearnaise sauce itself nothing special. you combine the sauce with the fried onion on top of the slider and the bun. ok. sure pass on sliders plus heavy app start the meal.\n\ni had the street taco (<mark>Chicken Tinga</mark>). i wanted too try something different then my last visit. i glad i did! it was awesome. the combination of the chipotle tomatoe sauce plus the feta cheese right balance with spice and cheese. i enjoyed the fact not over stuffed with things in the taco. i added the beans and rice. the rice was tasty stuff. the beans honest never got too because the beers and apps all stuff. \n\ndessert my cousin and i split a lemon souffle off our sever recommendation. she got right on. it was not your traditional souffle. that it would be bursting like ballon out of the dish. it smaller portion really for one. dessert we were all pretty full but try something sweet. it was just right amount of lemon and whipping cream or ice cream on top. it perfect dish too end the night. good good, good times, and family!!",

            "big fan of yard house especially this location at town square, because it's a usual family friendly spot for happy hour where the parents can enjoy food and a few adult beverages and then walk it off at town square afterwards :)  yet it's also a cool spot to hang with co-workers or friends.  a good mix of either, yet when your their with the family you don't feel awkward because so many other people are having family nights out and then when you are there with adults only, you aren't bothered by all the kids around, which is pretty rare to find a place that can manage to do both at the same time.  maybe because it's a little dim and louder inside, but either way how the booths and tables are set up it's not too loud where you can't hear each other talk.\n\nhappy hour menu is one of the best i think in town.  a variety of good choices that aren't just appetizer size, but could be full meals, so getting a good amount for what you pay for. \n\n<mark>Chicken <mark>Shiitake <mark>Lobster Garlic Noodles</mark></mark></mark>, <mark>Poke Stack</mark>, sliders, onion stack and cheese pizza for the kids are our go-tos.  i have had items off the happy hour menu and those were delicious too.  i don't think i've ever had anything i don't like here.  recently had the mushroom <mark>Lettuce Wraps</mark> while doing the daniel fast and those were really good as well.\n\na good local go to spot for us, especially for family friday nights at town square :)",

(we come after we  perform in shows) \n\nlike i said i love the reverse happy hour menu so honestly that's the only things i've ever tried... and their dessert! yummy! my absolute favorite is the garlic <mark><mark>Chicken Noodle</mark></mark>!!! i see it more as a meal than an appetizer! lo mein type noodles <mark>Penne with Chicken</mark> chunks accompanied by garlic flavor, edamame seeds, parmesan cheese toppings, shiitake mushrooms, chunks of tofu, and sliced asparagus!!! who wouldn't love that?! it's absolutely delicious and just the right amount of garlic flavor. \n\nall of their happy hour appetizers are a must try. their half off pizzas are delicious, and my other favorite go to meal is the ahi-<mark>Poke Stack</mark>. perfectly lightly wasabi coated ahi tuna chunks stacked on wonton wafers accompanied with carrot and radish slices all lightly coated in the soy and wasabi ginger sauce with slices of fresh avocado on the side!!  \n\nwhen i order just the <mark>Chicken <mark>Shiitake <mark>Lobster Garlic Noodles</mark></mark></mark> and the <mark>Poke Stack</mark> during happy hour, with tip and tax included i walk out paying $15. can't beat that!!! \n\nnot to mention to amazing beer selection they have available!! pear cider is my go to! \n\ntry everything on their appetizer menu! i promise they do not disappoint",

            "i don't know if the yard house at town center is typical of other yard house locations... but my first impression of the one at town center is \"wow! the largest bar / sports bar i've ever been to!\" the bar must have been forty yards long with a circular seating arrangement... that's almost a football field length of seating just to consume liquor or watch your favorite team on one of the lcd tvs. don't feel comfortable at the \"bar\"? ... well there's dimly lit table seating around the extremities of the interior of the yard house, as well as outside seating under a covered patio.\n\nif you're not consuming your liquor at happy hour here at the yard house... you have a lot more money to spare than i do, or you're just being extravagant for no rational reason. lindeman's framboise at only $4.00 a glass! raspberry cider, also at the same price! and, the happy hour extends late into the night...\n\nas for the food... specifically the appetizers... the menu needs work...\n\n  <mark>Spicy Thai Chicken</mark> pizza (*) first of all, it's a thin-crust pizza.. a \n      negative already! carrots, green onion, cilantro, mozzarella, \n      macadamia nuts, and firecracker sauce as a topping... essentially \n      very, very close to a vegan pizza. prior apologies to all vegans... \n      yecch!\n  chicken lettuce wrap (**** 1/2) stir fried, smoked tofu, pine nuts and \n      green onions with three dipping sauces with a meat choice of either \n      chicken, tiger shrimp, or shiitake and portabella mushrooms. very, \n      very good. \n  <mark>Onion Ring Tower</mark> (****) beer battered and dusted with parmesan \n      cheese... served with chipotle and ranch dip sauces. and... i don't \n      even like onion rings... that's saying a lot for the perfectly made \n      onion rings!\n  <mark>Chicken Nachos</mark> (**) thin, and i mean thin tortilla chips with cheddar \n      and jack cheese, tomato, cilantro, onions, guacamole and spicy \n      whole pinto beans. chips were deteriorating as we sat. word to the \n      wise... consume this appetizer quickly, or it just turns into mush. \n      definitely, not as good as one of the many cheap, late-night taquerias \n      you can find around las vegas.\n  <mark>Fried Calamari</mark> (**** 1/2) an appetizer which i never order because most \n      restaurants usually over-fry the calamari where it becomes \n      super-tough and chewy... but not that night when we consumed it! \n      served with spicy tomato and tartar sauces.\n  <mark>Spicy Tuna Roll</mark> (**) definitely, not a favorite at the table. not enough \n      tuna, maybe? or it could've been the odd mixture of textures with an \n      almost crunchy edamame. <mark>Pan Seared Ahi</mark> tuna with avocado, edamame, \n      cucumber and wasabi soy sauce.\n  <mark>Classic Sliders</mark> (***) nothing special here. four mini burgers made from \n      naturewell natural angus beef served with cheddar cheese, house \n      special sauce, fries and pickle. preparation of the fries were better \n      than the sliders!\n\ndo you know what it takes to transport all the liquor over to the bar area? as i was looking around yard house to take some pics... i noticed the shiny pipes running along the ceiling emanating from the entrance area of yard house heading off in the direction of the bar. there are, literally, dozens of pipes that feed liquor to the bar stored in an orange-hued room ( http://static.px.yelp.com/bphoto/uxe7cbax8_9h82ljsg2jxw/l ) ( http://static.px.yelp.com/bphoto/a1ufhhyumxc145flbncylw/l ) to the left of the entrance as you walk in. moving that much liquor takes quite a bit of technology!\n\nliquor @ happy hour (*****)\nappetizers (***)\n\ndessert? not tonight. went back to my son's house for guava cake ( http://www.yelp.com/biz/akis-bakery-san-jose#hrid:nkspkohhhesyqkf1wn_nog ), which i brought over from san jose...", 
            "while the yardhouse is basically a restaurant for adults, it's also really great for families.\n\ni'm a huge fan of the yardhouse, and even though it's a chain (there are locations all over the west), it has really great food and probably the best on-tap beer selection i've seen in any restaurant.\n\nas for the food, i've tried all kinds of dishes and i've never been disappointed. my favorites are the <mark>Lobster Garlic Noodles</mark>, the surf and turf burger (a hamburger with asparagus, lobster and a bernaise sauce) and the \"<mark>Spicy Tuna Roll</mark>\" which may be the best appetizer in this type of restaurant in las vegas. it's basically a deconstructed <mark>Spicy Tuna Roll</mark> that looks like a birthday cake  - with layers of endamame, cucumber, tuna and avocado. it's awesome, and even my kids like snacking on the endamame before the entrees arrive.\n\nthe beer selection is immense, and it used to be perfect, but i have to take points off because they recently removed tetley's (one of my favorite beers). but honestly? any place that has both obscure belgian ales and pabst blue ribbon on draft can't be bad.\n\nas for the kids menu it is what you'd expect, but all the food is just a little better quality than you normally get in a similar restaurant. in fact the mac and cheese is so good (i'm pretty sure there's some truffle oil in there) that your kids might not like it. though, you'll probably enjoy it the next day for lunch.\n\ni can't vouch for the service in other yard houses, but the service in the one in vegas has always been outstanding. and in the very few instances where we've had a problem, they've taken money off the bill and rectified the situation immediately.\n\ni can't say enough good things about this restaurant, and if you find yourself shopping in town square and need a quick place for lunch, it's really the best.",

            "yard house has been updated to a 5 star, after several visits helped to elevate it to one of the best overall restaurants on the west end.\n\nthe most recent visit was after a disastrous experience at the gordon biersch down the street (see review). i am willing to admit that my disgust with gb's could have influenced this particular visit to yard house, but after all, the right time and the right place are also factors by which we develop opinions.\n\ni had two items off the happy-hour appetizer menu, the <mark>Pan Seared Ahi</mark> tuna and the <mark>Spicy Tuna Roll</mark>.\n\nthe bartender kindly warned me that the <mark>Spicy Tuna Roll</mark> was presented in a completely different manor than i was probably used to, offering my a bit of his personal insight to allow me an opportunity to rethink my decision. but i am a culinary warrior with the self-proclaimed fortitude that has catapulted me toward some of the worlds greatest food discoveries - and i was not about to be deterred by unconventionalism.\n\nthe presentation was unusual, to say the least. but this work of art was visionary delight, in a castle of tuna, a delightfully mild wasabi sauce and a number of items i wont embarrass myself trying to identify. it was almost too beautiful to want to breach the walls of this incredible castle, but the urge to sample its goods was too tempting. i can say, although its taste resembled a <mark>Spicy Tuna Roll</mark> in many ways, it uniqueness made it truly a one of a kind item.\n\nthe <mark>Pan Seared Ahi</mark> tuna, which i had had before, was delicious as always and its presentation rivaled that of its chivalrous brother.\n\ni am truly blessed to be within a stones throw of yard house. i suggest you stop in some time - you might just see me there.",

            "i admit it, i'm a yard house whore. \n\ni seriously love this place. the restaurant has such a chill and laid back vibe. it's huge and has ample seating. they have nice cushiony booths so if you and a date come by then you can have a semi-romantic dinner on one of those. want to sit outside? they have a nice patio area in which they have heaters for the chillier days. they have tvs all over the place with different channels. games are on most of the time. if you want to watch a specific game on a specific tv, all you have to do is ask.\n\ni'm not a big beer person. but yard house is the one place i will indulge in a glass (or two...or three...). my favorite beer is the lindeman's framboise. a belgian lambic beer, it has the perfect cidery raspberry taste. they serve it in some sort of champagne glass - it makes me want to pinky up because i feel almost sophisticated drinking it! i also love their fruit ciders, especially their pear cider. the snakebite is also divine - it's a blend of the pear cider and harp. besides their beer, they have pretty good specialty mixed drinks. one that comes to mind is their pomegranate margarita. tart and pomegranite-y with a pretty presentation!\n\ntheir food awesome! my faves are listed below:\n\n[before i list specific food items, i'd like to say that yard house has really really good fries. they're super thin and super addicting. if you're into the thick cut steak fries, you won't find them here]\n\nappetizers\n- seared <mark>Ahi Sashimi </mark>: about 6 pieces of seared tuna covered in soy vinaigrette is served next to a small bed of red cabbage also covered in the vinaigrette. i really like this dish when it's made right. sometimes they over-drench the sashimi pieces and the dish becomes ultra salty.\n- <mark>Onion Ring Tower</mark>: literally, the name says it all. it's apparently beer battered and comes with a chipotle ketchup and ranch dressing. \n- <mark>Spicy Tuna Roll</mark>: if you're expecting a typical sushi roll, then don't. this is served without rice and as a stack. bottom layer are edamame and cucumbers. middle layer is your tuna and the top layer is the avocado. it's a pretty dish. very innovative. \n- sliders: specifically the bearnaise or ahi sliders. four sliders plus a handful of fries. they call this an appetizer, but the portions are not appetizer-like!\n\nentree\n- mac & cheese squared: chicken, bacon, mushrooms, truffle oil. can't go wrong with this one. they use wild mushrooms that elevated your boring mac & cheese to the next level. \n[this is it for entrees. i usually stick with their appetizers.]\n\ndessert\n- chocolate souffle: small souffle good for one. scoop of vanilla ice cream on top with mint garnish. do not leave without trying this. i'm seriously serious. \n\nyard house has great happy hour. 3 pm - 6 pm monday - friday and 10 pm - close sunday - thursday. drink specials and half off on a lot of their appetizers! their sliders are discounted as well. perfect late night meal.",

            "great beer and even cocktails menus. love leinenkugel sunset wheat, sam adams cherry wheat or ruby red cocktail. hard to pick a winner. i've heard the new beer cocktails are \"weird\" so haven't tried those.\n\nservice is usually good. the servers attitudes are sometimes better than the food runners. i've had plates slung at me...i laughed it off on all accounts, it's a tough job, i get it. they try to keep drinks filled, sometimes they succeed. better at keeping the alcohol flowing than the water, if you get my drift aka $$. \n\nsome of my family's favorites are chicken fingers (kids menu), their fries, <mark>Spicy Tuna Roll</mark> & <mark><mark>California Roll</mark></mark> (two of my faves), seared <mark>Ahi Sashimi </mark>, pastrami sliders & the chicken <mark>Lettuce Wraps</mark>. mac n cheese is amazing, but i usually allow myself to order it once a year- it's so rich. also, loved the lobster garlic noodle; it's a special occasion dish, too! any of their salads are good. the gorgonzola dressing is great. skip their pizzas. \n\ncheck their hh special before you go.\n\noverall, i am especially fond of the vibe, the layout/lighting & decor, and their great playlist. service and food are good enough and the drinks are great!", 
            "i love coming here during happy hours. the food is delicious! it's not good enough to be paid for full price but definitely worth when it's half off lol \nso we got the <mark>Chicken Nachos</mark>, <mark><mark>Queso Dip</mark></mark>, chicken wings, <mark>Spicy Tuna Roll</mark> and <mark><mark>California Roll</mark></mark>. the california is a big giant roll. it's not like a traditional roll. it's just one big roll. the rice was under cooked so we ask them to take it back but literally everything else was great. best buffalo sauce ever! i especially loved the wings because i'm a chicken person lol \nthey have great quality fish for their <mark>Spicy Tuna Roll</mark>, they use ahi fish instead tuna bc it's a better fish i guess. \nthe <mark>Chicken Nachos</mark> is huge, you can check the picture, one order of <mark>Chicken Nachos</mark> is enough to share with your whole party. it's ginormous. \ntheir <mark><mark>Queso Dip</mark></mark> was really really good. the cheese was a bit spicy, for white people, but it was delicious for me. haha \nour server, mike, was really friendly and helpful. \nthe only thing that i think would be a concern for some people is the loud noise. but then again people only come here for the loudness. lol bc they have like a million tv in here with sports turned on. haha \nanyway, i hope you enjoy it and hopefully this helped. :)", 
            "let me tell you why yard house is one of the preferable chain restaurants over most. the beer selection is on point. if you love beers then this place is a go-to because of their extensive selection. my recommendations for people who like fruitier beers:\n* abita purple haze - raspberry belgian wheat\n* lindeman's framboise - raspberry\n* lindeman's peche - peach \nalso i highly recommend the house honey blonde for anyone who enjoys lagers.\n\nsecondly, i have not been disappointed by the food. if you're adventurous with your food, i recommend the <mark>Spicy Tuna Roll</mark> or ahi <mark>Poke Stack</mark>. it's always fresh and super flavorful. the shiitake <mark>Chicken <mark>Shiitake <mark>Lobster Garlic Noodles</mark></mark></mark> are so yummy! you could get full off of those two dishes alone. the <mark>Roasted Turkey Pot Pie</mark> is a classic and it's definitely something you need to try if you haven't already.\n\nwell played yard house, well played."

            "i've been to their location in long beach before & enjoyed it.  this is a nice addition to the area solely because of the outdoor seating. this time of year, i base my dining options on outdoor seating availability.  i'll sit outside when it's 105.  i love fresh air!\n\nanyway, a few of us stopped in for a drink & a snack one night.  the service was blah, she mixed up our beers (dark & light) & the food blah as well.  calamari boring.  <mark>Spinach Cheese Dip</mark>, too much pre chopped, undercooked garlic flavor.  blah.  \n\nhaving enjoyed it in ca we thought to give it another try.  this time we took the in-laws in town from the uk.  they were in need of a good pint or two.  our experience was a lot better this time.  our server was still a little blah, as if she wasn't comfortable interacting with her tables.  she was fairly competent at least.  the food was good for it being a chain.  in fact it's probably the best chain food out there, but truthfully i just go for the beer.  \n\ni'll go back to drink & eat...", 
            "whenever i feel the need to add some extra lbs, clog my arteries, and work on my beer gut i come here. so obviously i try to avoid this place like the plague for my own sanity. but when i have one of those \"ah screw it\" moment i get the mac and cheese squared. i think it only has 398,000 calories which 397,456 are from fat but how can you resist? different types of cheeses, chicken, bacon, mushrooms, truffle oil. i think i may be bold enough to say its one of the best macaroni and <mark>Spinach Cheese Dip</mark> you may have.\n\ni think everything i've had here has been decently good, when i try and eat healthy i'll order their chicken and veggie bowl. it probably has enough salt to flavor a sunflower seed factory but for it being somewhat low in fat and full in veggies, its pretty good. all in all not too many complaints, bad for my cholesterol levels and liver but hey we can still be friends yardhouse.", 
            "this has by far been one of the best happy hour menu's.  they have their sliders, pizza's, and popular appetizers at a low price.  well, if you bring a big group or if you're sharing for 2.  you can get about 3 to 4 dishes for almost $13.00.  \n\nthe atmosphere of this place is ok, if you like that fast paced and loud noise ambiance.  it's tolerable, and i have yet to experience bad service.  the servers are quick to get your order, great with drink refills, and the food comes out in less than 20 mins.  (*quick note: never eat here, not unless it's happy hour, otherwise you'd be paying $10 - $15 for appetizers and entree's*) \n\nthings to order:  \n- chicken lettuce wrap - ground chicken sauteed with diced mushrooms, onion leaves, and spices, served upon a fried wonton bowl accompanied with 8-9 <mark>Lettuce Wraps</mark>.  there are three types of sauces, i think regular, mild and spicy?  i'm not too sure on that, but the regular sauce is my favorite.  \n\n- <mark>Fried Calamari</mark> - nothing too special, but a definite must have for a vast mix.  the calamari is always fried to a crisp, tossed in a salt a pepper mix served with tartar sauce and a marinara sauce i think?  \n\n- hawaiian <mark>Poke Stack</mark> - for some reason the fish tastes very fresh, as opposed to other restaurants who try their hardest to execute a poke dish.  yardhouse i'd say, prepares it well.  ahi poke tossed in a hawaiian style marinade, served upon two wonton crisps with soy & sesame oil bean sprouts and carrots.  \n\n- onion ring stack - an <mark>Onion Ring Tower</mark> served with two types of sauces: ranch and chipotle.  i personally like the chipotle sauce.  the onion rings are fried to perfection, the onions doesn't slip out of the fried batter.  \n\n- <mark>Chicken Nachos</mark> - mmmmmm, a huge plate of nachos served with the toppings of a mexican nacho.  the cheese sizzles when served and the chicken is quite succulent, although the pieces should be chopped up a little more.  \n\n- <mark>Spinach Cheese Dip</mark> - my very favorite, spinach and cheese mixed together in a hot mix (not spicy).  served with largely cut toasted bread instead of chips!  what's even better, they lightly top the bread with parmesan! \n\nthis a definite must go to if you're having a get together.  the food is good, and so is the experience.  another pro to this, is that after eating you can go watch a movie.  since the movie theatre is in fact right across the building.", 
            "i've been here a couple times before, but once i turned 21 this has been one of my go-to spots for happy hour because the specials are amazing! the fact that they have mini take home happy hour menus makes it all the more tempting as well. \n\nallow me break it down for you:\nhappy hour is mon-fri 3pm-6pm, sun-wed 10pm-close\n\ndomestic pints - $3.50, craft&import pints - $4.25-$4.75\nsliders served on a bed of fries  ($6.75): classic, bearnaise, pastrami, turkey, veggie. ahi is $9.95\n\nhalf priced pizzas: <mark><mark>Bbq Chicken</mark></mark>, 4cheese, ham & pineapple, margherita, pepperoni & mushroom, <mark>Spicy Thai Chicken</mark>\n\nhalf priced apps: <mark>Blue Crab Cakes</mark>, calamari, cali roll, chinese <mark>Chicken <mark>Shiitake <mark>Lobster Garlic Noodles</mark></mark></mark>, <mark>Chicken Nachos</mark>, <mark>Onion Ring Tower</mark>, wings, boneless wings, veggie wings, hawaiian <mark>Poke Stack</mark>, <mark>Spicy Tuna Roll</mark>, seared <mark>Ahi Sashimi </mark>, chicken <mark>Lettuce Wraps</mark>, <mark><mark>Gardein Fried Chicken Strips</mark></mark>, <mark>Spinach Cheese Dip</mark>, <mark>Moo Shu Egg Rolls</mark>\n\ndoesn't that just blow your mind? it's like a plethora of cheap happy hour eats and you'll probably get full off of one order of sliders, or 2 of their apps. \n\nso far i've tried:\n-bearnaise sliders (bearnaise sauce and fried shoestring onions on the patty w/ a side of very skinny fries that are tenderly cooked with a very light batter coating which gives them a perfectly crunchy exterior and \"juicy\" inside)\n-<mark><mark>Bbq Chicken</mark></mark> and <mark>Margherita Pizza</mark> (they pretty much taste as they should. sometimes the <mark><mark>Bbq Chicken</mark></mark> is a little too saucy for my taste though)\n-calamari (yum. perfectly fried on the outside and melting on the inside. served w/ marinara and, i wanna say tartar sauce? i usually go with the red..)\n-traditional wings (first and last time i had these, they were so spicy! my bf couldn't even handle them and he claims to love hot stuff, hehe. the thing that i don't like about these wings is that you can't choose how spicy you want them, so you have to be prepared for whatever they give you)\n\neverything i've tried has been pretty good so far and there is still so much more i have yet to try! i know my boyfriend has been having some sort of frenzy over the happy hour <mark>Poke Stack</mark>. he's gone to this location about 4 times in the past month, by himself, just to sit and eat the <mark>Poke Stack</mark>, so i can only guess how delicious it must be. \n\nkey points:\n-happy hour is awesome here\n-traditional wings are hot! (at least for me)\n-calamari is delectable\n-french fries are close to perfect\n-great for groups\n-service has been pretty fast on the days that i've gone",

            "sad to say that i went on a friday during lent so i had the <mark>Four Cheese</mark> pizza rather than my usual meat filled p<mark>Latte</mark>. the pizza was pretty darn good though and huge considering during happy hour it only cost 6.50. talk about a deal! my roomie had the cuban sandwich and said it was amazing. overall the food tasted pretty great and if you during happy hour i really think it's hard to beat this level of food for this price. a lot of places serve really small portions for their lunch specials or happy hour but i think this place does it right and gives you huge portions hoping you stay around long enough to drink up a nice tab. i for one am willing to fall into this trap any day of the week as long as their food stays on point. last star is missing because although the service was acceptable it wasn't star worthy. \n\ngreat food, good size portions, happy hour makes their food cheap so plan accordingly.\n\n(spinach and <mark>Spinach Cheese Dip</mark> is pretty awesome btw.)",

            "an all-inclusive place to hang out, eat, drink, and watch the latest sports on their multiple tvs!  with it being vegas, no dress code or cover charge means it will be very popular!\n\nwalking in on a saturday night, expect a wait of at least an hour because that's how long we waited for our party of four.  call ahead to get yourself on the list since they don't take reservations for parties less than 10!  if you're lucky, you can squeeze yourself over by the bar and try one of their 100 to 250 beers on tap.  they say they do offer the \"world's largest selection of draft beer.\"  you can order it by the pint or half yard, but watch out if you break the half yard glass; it'll cost you an extra $10!  but if you want a sampling, request their six-pack.  it's a weekly rotating variety of six different beers so you can get a taste of each.\n\nthe best seats are in the booths, which can fit five comfortably.  the tables in the middle are for the big parties, but you're constantly being bumped into as people and staff attempt to squeeze on by.\n\nwe went for a variety of appetizers to share:\n\n* grilled jamaican wings: \"tossed in jerk spices with rum bbq sauce\" $10.25 - a generous amount of wings, but not enough of that sauce.  full of flavor though and tasty!\n\n* firecracker wings: \"tossed in a spicy sesame garlic plum glaze\" $10.25 - favored over the jamaican wings because of the spice kicker.\n\n* grilled hearts of romaine: \"topped with red onions, candied walnuts and a gorgonzola champagne vinaigrette\" $8.95 - good enough to share with really nice walnuts and yummy dressing.  even the guys in our group were fighting over it!\n\n* baby leaf spinach: \"portabella mushrooms, red onions, smoked gouda, tomatoes, croutons, and balsamic vinaigrette\" $7.95 - not enough portabella mushrooms, but i like the gouda.\n\n* lobster, crab & <mark>Lobster, Crab & Artichoke Dip</mark>: \"main lobster, blue crab and artichoke hearts baked with a <mark>Four Cheese</mark> blend served with tortilla chips and grilled flat bread\" $11.45 - good dip, but not the most popular dish we ordered.\n\n* barnaise sliders: \"four mini burgers made from naturewell natural angus beef served with fried onions, barnaise sauce, fries and pickle $9.95 - the fried onions make it taste really good, although the side of barnaise sauce sure doesn't hurt.  even the thin fries taste good!\n\n* <mark>Classic Sliders</mark>: \"four mini burgers made from naturewell natural angus beef served with cheddar cheese, our house special sauce, fries and pickle\" $9.95 - only okay after you try the barnaise ones, stick to that one instead.  \n\n* fresh baked brownie: \"topped with mint chocolate chip, caramel or vanilla ice cream\" $7.95 - takes about fifteen minutes and meant for sharing.\n\n* draft beer float: \"lindeman's framboise with vanilla ice cream\" $6.50 - like a root beer float, but with lindeman's.\n\nthey do offer regular entrees like sandwiches, steaks, burgers, chicken, pizza, and seafood.  there's bound to be something on the menu for everyone, which makes this place a good choice.  the noise level is over the top though and you'll find yourself screaming to be heard.  (not exactly the best place for a date if you're sitting across from each other.  but a good place to check out people and possibly make some new friends.  we ran into quite a few people we knew that saturday night, so it's definitely a hopping place!)\n\nsince i'm still not a beer drinker, i like the yard house because they serve up lindeman's ($8, in a goblet) and wyder's.  i can drink something i enjoy while everyone else is having their rounds of beer.\n\nthey do offer happy hours: monday through friday, 3 pm to 6 pm; sunday through wednesday, 11 pm to close. select appetizers are half-priced and drinks are discounted.  after 11 pm on friday and saturday nights, it's 21 years and older.  the crowd does change a bit and the skirts become shorter.  there's even a line outside by then, so come in earlier and get yourself acquainted at the bar.\n\nthis place is kid-friendly since they do offer a kids' menu and their \"kids klub.\"  but you probably don't want to take them here on weekend nights.\n\nupdate! 05/31/08 - this time tried their (mac & cheese)2 \"roasted <mark>Southern Fried Chicken Breast</mark>, applewood bacon, wild mushrooms, cheddar and parmesan cheese with castellane pasta and white truffle oil.\"  next time, i'm going to skip the chicken because it's dried out.  but so yummy though when you get past the poultry part.", 
            "i don't know if the yard house at town center is typical of other yard house locations... but my first impression of the one at town center is \"wow! the largest bar / sports bar i've ever been to!\" the bar must have been forty yards long with a circular seating arrangement... that's almost a football field length of seating just to consume liquor or watch your favorite team on one of the lcd tvs. don't feel comfortable at the \"bar\"? ... well there's dimly lit table seating around the extremities of the interior of the yard house, as well as outside seating under a covered patio.\n\nif you're not consuming your liquor at happy hour here at the yard house... you have a lot more money to spare than i do, or you're just being extravagant for no rational reason. lindeman's framboise at only $4.00 a glass! raspberry cider, also at the same price! and, the happy hour extends late into the night...\n\nas for the food... specifically the appetizers... the menu needs work...\n\n  <mark>Spicy Thai Chicken</mark> pizza (*) first of all, it's a thin-crust pizza.. a \n      negative already! carrots, green onion, cilantro, mozzarella, \n      macadamia nuts, and firecracker sauce as a topping... essentially \n      very, very close to a vegan pizza. prior apologies to all vegans... \n      yecch!\n  chicken lettuce wrap (**** 1/2) stir fried, smoked tofu, pine nuts and \n      green onions with three dipping sauces with a meat choice of either \n      chicken, tiger shrimp, or shiitake and portabella mushrooms. very, \n      very good. \n  <mark>Onion Ring Tower</mark> (****) beer battered and dusted with parmesan \n      cheese... served with chipotle and ranch dip sauces. and... i don't \n      even like onion rings... that's saying a lot for the perfectly made \n      onion rings!\n  <mark>Chicken Nachos</mark> (**) thin, and i mean thin tortilla chips with cheddar \n      and jack cheese, tomato, cilantro, onions, guacamole and spicy \n      whole pinto beans. chips were deteriorating as we sat. word to the \n      wise... consume this appetizer quickly, or it just turns into mush. \n      definitely, not as good as one of the many cheap, late-night taquerias \n      you can find around las vegas.\n  <mark>Fried Calamari</mark> (**** 1/2) an appetizer which i never order because most \n      restaurants usually over-fry the calamari where it becomes \n      super-tough and chewy... but not that night when we consumed it! \n      served with spicy tomato and tartar sauces.\n  <mark>Spicy Tuna Roll</mark> (**) definitely, not a favorite at the table. not enough \n      tuna, maybe? or it could've been the odd mixture of textures with an \n      almost crunchy edamame. <mark>Pan Seared Ahi</mark> tuna with avocado, edamame, \n      cucumber and wasabi soy sauce.\n  <mark>Classic Sliders</mark> (***) nothing special here. four mini burgers made from \n      naturewell natural angus beef served with cheddar cheese, house \n      special sauce, fries and pickle. preparation of the fries were better \n      than the sliders!\n\ndo you know what it takes to transport all the liquor over to the bar area? as i was looking around yard house to take some pics... i noticed the shiny pipes running along the ceiling emanating from the entrance area of yard house heading off in the direction of the bar. there are, literally, dozens of pipes that feed liquor to the bar stored in an orange-hued room ( http://static.px.yelp.com/bphoto/uxe7cbax8_9h82ljsg2jxw/l ) ( http://static.px.yelp.com/bphoto/a1ufhhyumxc145flbncylw/l ) to the left of the entrance as you walk in. moving that much liquor takes quite a bit of technology!\n\nliquor @ happy hour (*****)\nappetizers (***)\n\ndessert? not tonight. went back to my son's house for guava cake ( http://www.yelp.com/biz/akis-bakery-san-jose#hrid:nkspkohhhesyqkf1wn_nog ), which i brought over from san jose...", 
            "this is a review about their happy hour sliders.\n\nthe skinny: okay burgers that have a poor patty to bun ratio and need more interesting toppings (3), service - long wait times, reasonable service (2.5), value: it's reasonable - not too expensive and within keeping with other happy hour specials in town.\n\nwe ordered a plate of bearnaise sauce sliders and <mark>Classic Sliders</mark>. serving sizes are large - one plate comes with four sliders and a side of fries.\n\nthe sliders are served on a slightly sweet pan-styled bun. overall, there is probably a little too much bun and not enough meat inside. the patties are well-seasoned, crisp however are a might on the dry side. \n\nthe classic came with some standard cheese and pickle - which was okay but would have been better if there was some lettuce or tomato on top. the bearnaise sliders come with some fried onions which really improved the flavour of the sliders and texture. the bearnaise sauce wasn't anything i needed to go back for however.\n\nthe skinny fries are okay when they're hot but once again suffer once they've sat out for too long. they are crisp but are a little on the thin cut fries side of things so it lacks some of the lovely mealiness inside.\n\noverall, not bad sliders, but nothing really special. the edge goes out to the bearnaise sliders by virtue of the fried onion topping.", 
            "boy is yard house pricey. good thing for the invention of happy hour. they hold theirs monday through friday from 4pm-6pm. my group got there at 4:45 and racked up most of the damage before hh ended, but the last few items boosted the check up by a third. \n\nthe well drinks run for four dollars and change, while the beers cost around four to six dollars. all the appetizers are half off and a great deal. if you are like me, a few of them makes for a better meal than any entree. \n\nwe got the <mark>Chicken Nachos</mark>, <mark><mark>Gardein Fried Chicken Strips</mark></mark>, <mark>Pan Seared Ahi</mark>, <mark>Classic Sliders</mark>, hummus, a pepperoni and mushroom pizza, and chicken wings. if you come during the designated time, then all of these except the hummus are half off. it is a great deal, but i would reconsider if it was at full price. they are generous with their portions. both the sliders and <mark><mark>Gardein Fried Chicken Strips</mark></mark> come in an order of four with fries. this was perfect because it matched the number of people at our table. both dishes would be worth it at the regular price. the ahi tuna was cooked nicely, but the sauce was too salty. it definitely did not need soy sauce, but i used up all the wasabi. the <mark>Chicken Nachos</mark> were nothing special. it is a generous portion, but the salsa looked more like marinara, the chicken was on the dry side, and the guacamole lacked the tang and spice. they were also bountiful with the wings. asking for them to be cooked extra crispy and having the sauce on the side guarantees for perfect wings. the hummus was packed with sodium and tasted a little bitter. the pizza came out quick, bubbling, and beautiful. too bad, i was too full by that time, but my friend liked it.  \n\nif you ever wanted to try a new beer, but afraid you might not like it, come for happy hour. at worst, you are out a few dollars. at best, you might meet your new best friend. \n\nanother thing worth mentioning, the staff were on their game tonight. it was not that busy, but our server was awesome. crystal was funny, sassy, and full of energy. \n\nthe only reason why i gave them three stars is because i worry about the amount of salt they use in all of their dishes. i know people complain about msg at chinese restaurant, but i drank five glasses of water while dining and am still guzzling it now. it was tasty, but my taste buds are on over drive and going nuts.", 
            "came in at 10:15 p.m. and was told that the wait will be 35 minutes. we got seated 10 minutes after. under-promised and over-delivered. perfect way to do business.\n\nwe came here for the happy hour. the amazing thing is that the \"appetizers\" here are nothing short of greatness. we got the <mark>Classic Sliders</mark> (protein style), ahi poke, spicy tuna style (2), calamari, chicken lettuce wrap, and <mark>Ahi Sashimi </mark>.\n\nthe sliders are similar to any other bar food. the ahi tuna, <mark>Spicy Tuna Roll</mark> style was amazing. presented beautifully as well. i think the portion of the calamari was huge for $6. the chicken lettuce wrap alone will hit all of your taste buds! also, the sashimi here is amazing! i can't wait to arrive again!\n\nour server was bryan, and he got a great tip to accommodate his service!",

            "this was the second time i've been to a yard house.. the first time was in san diego.  i love the selection of beer and when you go you have to get your beer in the half-yard glass. it's a must. the best/worst part about it is when you get towards the bottom of your beer the glass acts more like a beer bong. the liquid just shoots down your throat. i guess it makes the experience more fun. \n\nthe food was good. we just got a bunch of appetizers. \n\nsliders: theses were okay, not out standing. \nasian glazed chicken wings: yummie! they were my favorite but a bit spicy. \n<mark>Coconut Shrimp</mark>: you get like two shrimps.. okay maybe three and they weren't that good. \nmac and cheese: yummie! i liked it but i couldn't really taste any truffle oil. \npear and walnut salad: i liked this dish a lot. almost finished all of it myself.\nchicken <mark>Lettuce Wraps</mark>: ehhh... like any other wrap. \n\nall in all go for the beer. i'm sure they'll have your favorite!", 
            "my first time at the yard house wasn't really anything special, but i can see why people would like it. the ambiance is cozy for sports enthusiasts and beer connoissers.  they have about 150 different beers on tap which is impressive. i sat at the bar and had one of the beers on tap. after looking thru their extensive beer menu, i ordered the sin city light; it was good. it's about $6 for a beer. so for the most part, the bar is what makes the place; along with all the flat screen tvs mounted throughout.\n\nas a restaurant...they need a lot of work. i ordered the <mark><mark>Roast Beef Dip</mark></mark>. a simple dish (it's a sandwich for crying out loud), how can anyone get that wrong...au jus was too salty. that's what makes the sandwich! also, they need to melt the provolone in the sandwich. they just slapped on a cold piece of cheese! one of my friends had the porter house steak. she had ordered it medium, but she realized as she was cutting into the steak that it was a little on the rare side. once she pointed that out to our non-attentive waiter, he did take the steak back and correct it. the manager even brought it back out to her and apologized for that and did not charge for her entree. that was nice of him... my cousin had the <mark>Lettuce Wraps</mark>. i didn't try them, but he says that the wraps were really good. my brother had the ahi salad. he liked it. the prices on their food menu are comparable to that of a chilis or chevy's.\n\nnow about our waiter...seems like he was trying to avoid us the whole time we were there. the sad thing is that he was also training someone on the floor that night; what a good example he is setting for the trainee! we had to wave him down a couple of times for drinks and a couple times for condiments. come to think of it, we didn't even get place settings until after our food arrived. we had to ask another waiter for that! he only came by to check on us once, and that was the same time he slapped us the bill.", 
            "i decided to wait for mi amigas at the bar, so i waited...waited...and waited for the bartender to acknowledge me...and it wasn't even busy!  after a good 10 minutes, i finally got my drink and, at the same time, mi amigas showed up ready to eat.  as crowds started to pile in for dinner, my very bright red disco-light pager thing went off. we were seated in one of their very long booths, that can take forever to get out of if you're sitting by the wall.  we had the pleasure of having a waiter who was training a newbie (shadowing).  it's cool to train new staff, but it seemed like our \"veteran\" waiter had difficulty multi-tasking with serving, remembering small stuff, and training.  other waiters were gracious enough to help out.  \n \nthe large selection of beers, happy hour, and the fact that it's located in the new town square mall, away from casinos, inspires me to come back.  my new favorites at yh are the mouth-freakin-watering ahi dishes (<mark>Ahi Crunchy </mark> salad and seared <mark>Ahi Sashimi </mark> appetizer), <mark>Lettuce Wraps</mark>, and the lobster-crab-<mark>Lobster, Crab & Artichoke Dip</mark>.  mi amiga's grilled <mark>Rib Eye</mark> steak was not cooked to her specs, so she returned it.  next thing you know, the general manager personally serves her a new <mark>Rib Eye</mark> steak done right...on the house.  now that's the way to do it!", 
            "this place has an awesome, fantastic happy hour.  i've been here a couple times for happy hour and the deals are great.  i always get an appetizer, pizza, and sliders to share.  i've never been disappointed.  everything is great.  i've tried most of the happy hour menu so i can say that with confidence.  i'd say if it's your first time the <mark>Lettuce Wraps</mark> are the thing you want to try.  the ciders are also great and not heavy in the alcohol taste, so perfect for the drinker that doesn't dig tasting alcohol.", 
            "ohhh i how i loathe reviewing another chain.  i have eaten here so many times and had an okay experience.\n\nhowever, yesterday i was there for happy hour with a small group, and we had our share of issues.  first - for whatever reason, the waitress stacked like 7 or more menus on the table, and never picked them up.  as people came to join us outside on the patio, we had to keep moving them on top of the planter divider things that separate the patio from the sidewalk.\n\nwe ordered different flavored teas.  the waitress brought separate ice cups and was very slow to refill tea.  she also never brought the limes my friend asked for twice, until we flagged her and reminded her - she had to write it down.\n\nfor happy hour, they make the chicken <mark>Lettuce Wraps</mark> half off but not the mushroom - weird.  so we opted for chicken...and out they came, with the nastiest lettuce cups i have ever seen - completely brown and pink, looking rotten and absolutely inedible.  since the waitress disappeared, i had to wait like 15 minutes before showing her and asking for new lettuce.  quite a while later, she brought a plate with nastier, browner, pinker lettuce.  i told her no way, and she took that away to show her manager.  she took that off the bill and replaced it with another item, and luckily the protocol is to have the manager come out.  the manager apologized for the \"bad lettuce shipment,\" but i explained to her that under no circumstances should anyone in the kitchen allow nasty lettuce to be served, especially not twice.  i told her i strongly recommend that they do not serve lettuce to another person that day.  i hope she took my advice.  kinda turned me off....would rather come back for beer than food now.", 
            "this has by far been one of the best happy hour menu's.  they have their sliders, pizza's, and popular appetizers at a low price.  well, if you bring a big group or if you're sharing for 2.  you can get about 3 to 4 dishes for almost $13.00.  \n\nthe atmosphere of this place is ok, if you like that fast paced and loud noise ambiance.  it's tolerable, and i have yet to experience bad service.  the servers are quick to get your order, great with drink refills, and the food comes out in less than 20 mins.  (*quick note: never eat here, not unless it's happy hour, otherwise you'd be paying $10 - $15 for appetizers and entree's*) \n\nthings to order:  \n- chicken lettuce wrap - ground chicken sauteed with diced mushrooms, onion leaves, and spices, served upon a fried wonton bowl accompanied with 8-9 <mark>Lettuce Wraps</mark>.  there are three types of sauces, i think regular, mild and spicy?  i'm not too sure on that, but the regular sauce is my favorite.  \n\n- <mark>Fried Calamari</mark> - nothing too special, but a definite must have for a vast mix.  the calamari is always fried to a crisp, tossed in a salt a pepper mix served with tartar sauce and a marinara sauce i think?  \n\n- hawaiian <mark>Poke Stack</mark> - for some reason the fish tastes very fresh, as opposed to other restaurants who try their hardest to execute a poke dish.  yardhouse i'd say, prepares it well.  ahi poke tossed in a hawaiian style marinade, served upon two wonton crisps with soy & sesame oil bean sprouts and carrots.  \n\n- onion ring stack - an <mark>Onion Ring Tower</mark> served with two types of sauces: ranch and chipotle.  i personally like the chipotle sauce.  the onion rings are fried to perfection, the onions doesn't slip out of the fried batter.  \n\n- <mark>Chicken Nachos</mark> - mmmmmm, a huge plate of nachos served with the toppings of a mexican nacho.  the cheese sizzles when served and the chicken is quite succulent, although the pieces should be chopped up a little more.  \n\n- <mark>Spinach Cheese Dip</mark> - my very favorite, spinach and cheese mixed together in a hot mix (not spicy).  served with largely cut toasted bread instead of chips!  what's even better, they lightly top the bread with parmesan! \n\nthis a definite must go to if you're having a get together.  the food is good, and so is the experience.  another pro to this, is that after eating you can go watch a movie.  since the movie theatre is in fact right across the building.", 
            "visited the yardhouse at red rock casino over the weekend.  it was pretty late, well after midnight, and we obviously got right in and sat down.  wasn't too crowded.   wait staff was accommodating and friendly.\n\ni had the chicken <mark>Lettuce Wraps</mark>.  my girlfriend had the asian pork bbq appetizer.  both were pretty good.  the beer is good and they do have quite the collection from which to choose.\n\nwe like to go there roughly once a month and that won't change after our latest visit.  definitely a pleasant atmosphere and good place to get some food whether it's early or late.\n\n4 stars!", 
            "a favorite local spot for my hubby and i as we live just 10 minutes from town square. the food is always very good, although the atmosphere can be annoying sometimes with the insanely huge singles crowd simply there to drink and look for a date. my only pet peeve about this spot is that they don't have any type of call ahead seating or reservations, so if you go on friday or saturday, expect to wait at least an hour for a table. something like that just bothers me, i don't care if you want to take a credit card to hold a reservation like the high end joints do here in vegas, but at least give us the option of reserving a table! other than the insane waits and sometimes slow service, the food is great! try the <mark>Lettuce Wraps</mark>!", 
            "i've been here a couple times before, but once i turned 21 this has been one of my go-to spots for happy hour because the specials are amazing! the fact that they have mini take home happy hour menus makes it all the more tempting as well. \n\nallow me break it down for you:\nhappy hour is mon-fri 3pm-6pm, sun-wed 10pm-close\n\ndomestic pints - $3.50, craft&import pints - $4.25-$4.75\nsliders served on a bed of fries  ($6.75): classic, bearnaise, pastrami, turkey, veggie. ahi is $9.95\n\nhalf priced pizzas: <mark><mark>Bbq Chicken</mark></mark>, 4cheese, ham & pineapple, margherita, pepperoni & mushroom, <mark>Spicy Thai Chicken</mark>\n\nhalf priced apps: <mark>Blue Crab Cakes</mark>, calamari, cali roll, chinese <mark>Chicken <mark>Shiitake <mark>Lobster Garlic Noodles</mark></mark></mark>, <mark>Chicken Nachos</mark>, <mark>Onion Ring Tower</mark>, wings, boneless wings, veggie wings, hawaiian <mark>Poke Stack</mark>, <mark>Spicy Tuna Roll</mark>, seared <mark>Ahi Sashimi </mark>, chicken <mark>Lettuce Wraps</mark>, <mark><mark>Gardein Fried Chicken Strips</mark></mark>, <mark>Spinach Cheese Dip</mark>, <mark>Moo Shu Egg Rolls</mark>\n\ndoesn't that just blow your mind? it's like a plethora of cheap happy hour eats and you'll probably get full off of one order of sliders, or 2 of their apps. \n\nso far i've tried:\n-bearnaise sliders (bearnaise sauce and fried shoestring onions on the patty w/ a side of very skinny fries that are tenderly cooked with a very light batter coating which gives them a perfectly crunchy exterior and \"juicy\" inside)\n-<mark><mark>Bbq Chicken</mark></mark> and <mark>Margherita Pizza</mark> (they pretty much taste as they should. sometimes the <mark><mark>Bbq Chicken</mark></mark> is a little too saucy for my taste though)\n-calamari (yum. perfectly fried on the outside and melting on the inside. served w/ marinara and, i wanna say tartar sauce? i usually go with the red..)\n-traditional wings (first and last time i had these, they were so spicy! my bf couldn't even handle them and he claims to love hot stuff, hehe. the thing that i don't like about these wings is that you can't choose how spicy you want them, so you have to be prepared for whatever they give you)\n\neverything i've tried has been pretty good so far and there is still so much more i have yet to try! i know my boyfriend has been having some sort of frenzy over the happy hour <mark>Poke Stack</mark>. he's gone to this location about 4 times in the past month, by himself, just to sit and eat the <mark>Poke Stack</mark>, so i can only guess how delicious it must be. \n\nkey points:\n-happy hour is awesome here\n-traditional wings are hot! (at least for me)\n-calamari is delectable\n-french fries are close to perfect\n-great for groups\n-service has been pretty fast on the days that i've gone",

            "i've been here a couple times before, but once i turned 21 this has been one of my go-to spots for happy hour because the specials are amazing! the fact that they have mini take home happy hour menus makes it all the more tempting as well. \n\nallow me break it down for you:\nhappy hour is mon-fri 3pm-6pm, sun-wed 10pm-close\n\ndomestic pints - $3.50, craft&import pints - $4.25-$4.75\nsliders served on a bed of fries  ($6.75): classic, bearnaise, pastrami, turkey, veggie. ahi is $9.95\n\nhalf priced pizzas: <mark><mark>Bbq Chicken</mark></mark>, 4cheese, ham & pineapple, margherita, pepperoni & mushroom, <mark>Spicy Thai Chicken</mark>\n\nhalf priced apps: <mark>Blue Crab Cakes</mark>, calamari, cali roll, chinese <mark>Chicken <mark>Shiitake <mark>Lobster Garlic Noodles</mark></mark></mark>, <mark>Chicken Nachos</mark>, <mark>Onion Ring Tower</mark>, wings, boneless wings, veggie wings, hawaiian <mark>Poke Stack</mark>, <mark>Spicy Tuna Roll</mark>, seared <mark>Ahi Sashimi </mark>, chicken <mark>Lettuce Wraps</mark>, <mark><mark>Gardein Fried Chicken Strips</mark></mark>, <mark>Spinach Cheese Dip</mark>, <mark>Moo Shu Egg Rolls</mark>\n\ndoesn't that just blow your mind? it's like a plethora of cheap happy hour eats and you'll probably get full off of one order of sliders, or 2 of their apps. \n\nso far i've tried:\n-bearnaise sliders (bearnaise sauce and fried shoestring onions on the patty w/ a side of very skinny fries that are tenderly cooked with a very light batter coating which gives them a perfectly crunchy exterior and \"juicy\" inside)\n-<mark><mark>Bbq Chicken</mark></mark> and <mark>Margherita Pizza</mark> (they pretty much taste as they should. sometimes the <mark><mark>Bbq Chicken</mark></mark> is a little too saucy for my taste though)\n-calamari (yum. perfectly fried on the outside and melting on the inside. served w/ marinara and, i wanna say tartar sauce? i usually go with the red..)\n-traditional wings (first and last time i had these, they were so spicy! my bf couldn't even handle them and he claims to love hot stuff, hehe. the thing that i don't like about these wings is that you can't choose how spicy you want them, so you have to be prepared for whatever they give you)\n\neverything i've tried has been pretty good so far and there is still so much more i have yet to try! i know my boyfriend has been having some sort of frenzy over the happy hour <mark>Poke Stack</mark>. he's gone to this location about 4 times in the past month, by himself, just to sit and eat the <mark>Poke Stack</mark>, so i can only guess how delicious it must be. \n\nkey points:\n-happy hour is awesome here\n-traditional wings are hot! (at least for me)\n-calamari is delectable\n-french fries are close to perfect\n-great for groups\n-service has been pretty fast on the days that i've gone", 
            "ok so my last 2 -3 trips to yh were lackluster, as i previously wrote about.\n\nbut i have to give props for my visit on 7/26, and our server jameson.\n\nhe didn't mess up a single order for our entire group, got drinks and shots and refills out quickly, and was really fun and entertaining.\n\nour group ordered the <mark>Coconut Shrimp</mark> appetizer, <mark>Chicken Nachos</mark>, <mark>Poke Stack</mark>, a vegan <mark>Gardein Bbq Chicken Salad</mark>, gardein pasta, a <mark>Chicken <mark>Carnitas Enchilada Stack</mark></mark>, a couple burgers and whatever else i can't remember.\n\nthe food was good, served hot and it makes all the difference in the world to have an efficient server!\n\nnice job, yard house.", 
            "absolutely our favorite.  we eat here at least 40 times already.  they have two location one at red rock casino and one at town square.  if you are picky about the food, the food at red rock is slightly better than the one at town square so is the service.  happy hour is from 3-6 pm monday to wednesday.  late happy hour is after 11 pm til 2 am sunday to wednesday.  we recommend the <mark><mark>Bbq Chicken</mark></mark> pizza, <mark>Blue Crab Cakes</mark>, jamaican jerk wings, chinese chicken lettuce wrap, turkey slider not burger, <mark>Fried Calamari</mark>, try most of the happy hour appitizer they are pretty damn good.  outside of the happy hour menu, the food is pretty good and a little expensive for what it's worth to us.  beer seletction here is ridiculous!  something like over 100 different one.  they have tv all around with sport channel usually showing so this is great for all those that watch sports.", 
            "we totally pigged out here!  a great alternative to vegas buffet.  the <mark>Chicken <mark>Shiitake <mark>Lobster Garlic Noodles</mark></mark></mark> are so yummy.  the <mark><mark>Bbq Chicken</mark></mark> pizza is not bad either.  even my preschooler found the food tasty.  the atmosphere is casual and everyone seemed to be having a good time.  it could be a bit loud, but worked out well since my kid was watching a video on the ipad.", 
            "one of the best happy hours on \"the boulevard\" better yet in the vegas valley.  happy hour runs from mon-fri 3pm to 6pm and sun-wed 10pm to close. half price select apps. and certain beers and martinis are also at a discount. beware, that during happy hour, the place is packed wall to wall wall with people. so, if you want to make in time for happy hour, i suggest coming right at three or not to long after three. they also have really good pizza. my favorite is the <mark>Four Cheese</mark>. i've also tried the <mark><mark>Bbq Chicken</mark></mark> pizza, but the bbq does not go to well with the pizza. the mac and cheese is off the hook. just also know, cell phone service is unlikely.", 
            "pros:\n* delicious food. you have to try the <mark><mark>Gardein Blackened Chicken Torta</mark></mark> soup.\n* friendly staff.\n* modern menu and decor.\n\ncons:\n* expensive. the food while good is slightly too expensive.\n* due to the popularity, they're generally crowded with long waits.\n\ni believe town square to be the best shopping and restaurant plaza in las vegas. the quantity of choices for either is only matched by the quality. there certainly is no shortage of great food at town square and on yelp, yard house is rated best of them all. i haven't tried them all but i can definitely say yard house is the best i've had yet.\n\ni went with a group of four on a late tuesday afternoon. they weren't busy or crowded but i have seen the line pour out the door enough times to know i was lucky. we were promptly sat down just time to enjoy the happy hour menu. we ordered their famous tower of onion rings while we sifted through the massive menu. i ordered the <mark>Gardein Bbq Chicken Salad</mark> with a cup of <mark>Grilled Cheese & <mark><mark><mark>Organic Tomato Bisque</mark></mark></mark></mark> soup. the other members of my party ordered the barbeque <mark>Gardein Bbq Chicken Salad</mark> with a cup of <mark><mark>Gardein Blackened Chicken Torta</mark></mark> soup, pastrami sandwich, and a mushroom burger. \n\nwhen the <mark>Onion Ring Tower</mark> arrived it instantly lived up to the expectations. thin, lightly battered, crispy onion rings sprinkled with parmesan cheese and served with ranch and chipotle ranch. they bursted with flavor to die for. at first the tower seems so incredibly large but when you finish the memory feels small in hindsight. my soup and salad was good with a pleasant, creamy, rich ranch dressing and well-seasoned <mark>Grilled Cheese & <mark><mark><mark>Organic Tomato Bisque</mark></mark></mark></mark> soup. however, it paled in comparison to the nothing short of perfect, <mark><mark>Gardein Blackened Chicken Torta</mark></mark> soup. i have never had a <mark>Chicken Tortilla Soup</mark> so creamy and flavorful. they put a large piece of avocado in the cup along with the crispy tortilla strips and large chunks of chicken. together, they blend to create a truly wonderful and hearty cup of soup. i had a bite of the barbeque <mark>Gardein Bbq Chicken Salad</mark> and while it was a bit too saucy for my tastes, the barbeque dressing wasn't overpowering and went well with the large pile of onion strings atop the salad. the pastrami sandwich looked great and the burger looked even better. the burger bun instantly caught my eye with a smooth crisp surface devoid of any grease or sheen. next time i will surely try a burger. \n\nthe town square location is large and wide open. the lighting is dim and creates a hip vibe that went well with the modern menu. everyone in my group had a few questions about the menu and the server was friendly, knowledgeable, and willing to help. the prices however are a bit steep and you might want to arrive early to take advantage of the happy hour choices. one specific item that caught my eye was the 17 dollar macaroni and cheese. it looked delicious but it would have to be at that price.\n\nin the end i walked away satisfied and yearning to return to try a burger or maybe even that posh mac and cheese entree.", 
            "known for its selection of beers on tap, the food here is always amazing.  thought monkey had already tried everything, the adult mac n cheese is as good as a friend described. if you're gonna break a diet rule, this is one dish to do it with.  \n\nhaving had terrible fake meat at vegan vietnamese restaurants, monkey took a shot and trusted yard house's reputation for excellence. \n\nmonkey do:\ngardein <mark><mark>Bbq Chicken</mark></mark> pizza tastes just like the real thing!  so much that our non-vegetarian friends argued that it was really chicken.\nprawns over jicama - excellent\npear salad - tasty and refreshing\n\nmonkey will definitely return to try other gardein selections!", 
            "anchor steam beer on tap!! the service was great and the <mark><mark>Bbq Chicken</mark></mark> salad i ordered was pretty good and surprisingly filling. patio seating was perfect for the weather that day and i'll definitely be coming back.", 
            "let me begin by saying i brought this on myself. i was hungry, really really hungry, and yes i went for a chain restaurant. further more, order poorly, like really really poorly. i blame my actions on fatigue, and pray you don't judge me. \ncame here today for lunch at 3pm. was seated in their lovely patio. started off with guacamole, it was fine. when it came to our lunches my friend asked if he could have a pizza half pepperoni half <mark><mark>Bbq Chicken</mark></mark>. we were told you can't do half pizzas when they have different sauces. what? he explained he didn't care if the topping ventured onto the wrong sauce (bbq/tomato) and the kitchen refused. then came my brilliant order of the hawaiian <mark>Poke Stack</mark>. at this time, an alarm should have sounded in my brain \"rachel! it's ahi tuna! it's raw! it takes skill and quality to create a sublime product and your at a chain!\". instead my tummy prevailed, and what i got  was a stringy, chewy, tough, pile of butchered fish. \nlesson learned, when hungry and if you wind up at a chain, pause, think, then order.\ni do want to mention the staff is great and this in no way reflects on them.", 
            "i'm baaaaack. we gave yardhouse another try and our experience was definitely better - but the santana row location will always be home. \n\nwe decided to come for lunch and since the weather was beautiful we decided to sit outside. i have no idea why yardhouse does this but they sit people when their servers are at lunch. the logic makes no sense to me because how is there supposed to be service at a table when the server assigned to it is off the clock. right? i'm not sure either. this happened last time and it happened again. thankfully the server wasn't on lunch for a godly amount of time and we were actually able to get our order in in a timely manner.\n\nthe food seems really consistent location to location and you can't get me away from their french fries or  bbq ranch <mark>Gardein Bbq Chicken Salad</mark> but seating your customers in an area that won't get any service needs to change. until then, this place is still just \"ok\"", 
            "i have been here several times and had only good experiences so far. they have a huge selection of beers, several micro brews, and  lots of great food items. \n\nwe were a party of 6 last night and we sat out the patio. the service was very quick and friendly, although the place was mostly empty. our waiter was a bit of a low talker so it was very hard to hear him throughout the meal. \n\nwe sat outside on the patio and i ordered the <mark><mark>Bbq Chicken</mark></mark> salad which was excellent, little spicy but oh so good. this place is a great place to have a nice meal and a few drinks, while watching a game on tv. \n\ndef will be back for more.", 
            "we went for lunch on a sunday afternoon for my friend's birthday.  i've never been to a yard house.  they were located  on las vegas blvd at town square in las vegas.\n\nwe shared an order of <mark>Fried Calamari</mark>.  it came with tartar and spicy tomato sauce.  there was a good amount of tentacles and body breaded in a heavy cornmeal breading.\n\nmy friend ordered the half order of <mark>Ahi Crunchy </mark> salad which had 4 pieces of seared rare ahi, <mark><mark>Mixed Field Greens</mark></mark>, asian slaw and crispy wontons tossed in soy vinaigrette.  the full order had 6 pieces of seared rare ahi and more <mark><mark>Mixed Field Greens</mark></mark>.\n\nmy other friend ordered the lunch portion of <mark>Gardein Bbq <mark>Gardein Spicy Thai <mark>Bbq Chicken Pizza</mark></mark></mark> and a <mark>Classic Ranch</mark> salad.  the salad was just iceberg lettuce with shredded carrots, cucumber, and tomatoes.\n\ni ordered the lunch portion of half a <mark><mark>Roast Beef Dip</mark></mark> and a cup of <mark><mark><mark>Clam Chowder</mark></mark></mark>.\nthere was not a spoon on the plate, so i had to track down our server.  the <mark><mark>Roast Beef Dip</mark></mark> was tender and the creamy horseradish was really good.  next time i would order a whole <mark><mark>Roast Beef Dip</mark></mark> which comes with fries.  i had also ordered a side of french fries.  they were warm, not freshly fried.\n\nthe server brought out a complimentary mini lemon souffle with fresh raspberries and house made whipped cream with a candle for my friend's birthday.  it was very light.\n\ni will be back.", 
            "consistent food, drink and service! great go to spot. the only negative is their fried food is always cold. \ngreat snack food and the kung pow calamari is really good. black velvet is a staple drink as well. <mark><mark>Bbq Chicken</mark></mark> salad is good....", 
            "we came back due to having a gift card from the last time we were there...huge thank you to the manager for giving us a second try, or vice versa! \n\nwe had great service this time. wonderful service. the waiter trey gave us several suggestions and never seemed annoyed with all of our questions and never rushed us on ordering. when he went on break he brought in blair and introduced her...i thought that was very nice. she was awesome as well giving is more suggestions for our second round of drinks. \n\nwe ordered cocktails from their special menu in honor of the world cup...they were yummy and strong! our appetizer was the hawaiian <mark>Poke Stack</mark>. i could eat this for days! ahi tuna with carrot and dikon over flat fried wontons with an avacado and a very flavorful sauce on top. it was great.\n\nwe decided to get a pizza which we never get except from a pizza place. the <mark><mark>Bbq Chicken</mark></mark> with onion, cilantro and tangy sauce was what we ordered. overall the taste was on point. i wish i had ordered more sauce to go on top! my other half got <mark><mark><mark>Clam Chowder</mark></mark></mark> and said it was very hearty and had a to die for taste. \n\nwe were too full to get dessert this time. we can't wait to go back!", 
            "i came here for the first time on my girlfriend's behalf. she's always had positive things to say about this place, so i finally decided to go for it. the food was above average. i ordered the <mark>Lamb Burger</mark> and the barbecue <mark>Gardein Bbq <mark>Gardein Spicy Thai <mark>Bbq Chicken Pizza</mark></mark></mark>. for the food, i give it a 7.5/10. i'd rate this place four stars if it were solely based on food, but that isn't the case. the service was 'meh.' our waiter ignored us on multiple occasions and disregarded us. it took four tries to get a refill on water. it was as if he looked down on us (probably because we're younger.) you'd think all consumers would be treated equally without stereotypes, but i guess that's not the case here at yard house! good food. bad service.", 
            "the food gets 4 stars. i was quite impressed for it being mainly a bar scene. i got the <mark>Gardein Spicy Thai <mark>Bbq Chicken Pizza</mark></mark> and my girlfriend got the <mark>Pepperoni Pizza</mark>. the dessert was a straight home run. got the smores brownie. we ordered 2 and the server only bought out one. he admitted to making a mistake but i actually thanked him because 2 would have been way too much. i ordered it with a side of chocolate mint ice cream. delicious! \n\n2 stars for the overall seating situation. they weren't that busy (many visible tables open) and they took 45 minutes to seat a table of 6. i was disappointed with that. \n\noverall good experience. i definitely recommend going. hopefully you get seated sooner to enjoy the good food.", 
            "it was my first time to have dinner at the yard house. after shopping at the town square, my friend and i got hungry, so we randomly picked a restaurant. when we get to the entrance of the yard house, we saw people walk in and out, and some of people were just gathering in front of the entrance. this restaurant was very busy that it took us about half an hour to get a seat. we sat in the restaurant booth, which is about 8ft from the bar. the design of the dinning room is pretty. the room is dark, but very comfortable. i ordered the small size <mark>Penne with Chicken</mark>, which is in the house favorite category. my friend ordered the small size <mark><mark>Bbq Chicken</mark></mark> salad. even though the restaurant was very busy, the service was very fast. it took only about 10 minutes for the dishes to be served. in the <mark>Penne with Chicken</mark>, the penne was nicely mixed with the asparagus, mushrooms, tomato, and cheese, and it also looked glossy. the size of the dish was about 12 to 16oz. the smell of the dishes is very good that it is not too strong but mild. the penne was smooth and a little bit creamy; it was slippery in the mouth. the chicken was tender, and its flavor was salty, a little acid, and creamy. the acid flavor of the tomato was balanced with the marsala cream sauce. the <mark><mark>Bbq Chicken</mark></mark> salad had a very fresh smell and bright colors. the fried onion had a weaker smell than the no fried one, and it was well mixed with other greens. the texture of the salad was crispy and moist. because avocado, tomato, beans, corn, cilantro, and pasilla were included in this dish, it had flavor of salty, sweet, acid, and spicy. the chicken of the salad had a little burnt taste. the size of the salad is big that we did not finish it even though the one we order was a small size. due to the good first impression, my friend and i would like plan for a return.", 
            "one of my favorite restaurants of all time! this is one of the places where pretty much anything that you order will be delicious! they also carry my favorite beer: the house belgian amber triple! delicious if you like a darker brew with a soft after taste. i highly recommend the <mark>Gardein Bbq Chicken Salad</mark> and their garlic fries! mmmm! i probably go here once a week!",

            "the first time coming here, i was pretty impressed that they had a vegetarian menu. that was already a plus for me. i came here with family that had come into town and almost all of us ordered vegetarian. we had hummus and pita, <mark>Truffle Fries</mark>, <mark><mark>Deviled Eggs</mark></mark>,the gardein <mark><mark>Gardein Orange Peel Chicken</mark></mark>, the gardein <mark>Penne with Chicken</mark>, and  hongos y rajas tacos. they were all really good. i was impressed. many places that offer vegetarian dishes mess them up by adding too much of something, whether it's tofu or vegetables. in this case, the gardein products were utilized perfectly. for dessert, we had a mini creme brulee, a mini peach apple <mark>Cobb</mark>, and a mini lemon souffle. this entire meal was demolished by my family. the only reason i gave it 4 stars is because i ordered root beer thinking that a place that makes their own beer would make their own homeade root beer and cream soda. sadly, they only had barq's root beer. what a disappointment! i will definitely come back and enjoy more selections next time.\n\n\nthat was my last review.\n\nhere's an update. last time i went to yardhouse, i ordered vegetarian jerk wings. they were pretty good until i realized the wings were definitely not vegetarian. that is a mistake a restaurant should never make. luckily, i'm not a customer who likes to cause problems since i work in the industry but i was shocked that happened. for that, i demoted yardhouse.",

            "the service was great considering how busy it was hence the 1 star i give this place. the food was 0 stars. other than that, i would have given this place no stars. i ordered the <mark>Angel Hair Pasta</mark>, my bf ordered the dip with a side of <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> and our friend ordered a grilled chicken sandwhich with broccoli. when all of our orders came out, i tried the fries and they were cold. i mentioned it to my boyfriend and when he touched his sandwhich, it was also cold. i thought that was a bit weird, but when my friend took a bite if his sandwhich he said his chicken was also cold. i was thinking, maybe because it's a sandwhich, it wouldn't be that warm even though my bf ordered the <mark><mark>Roast Beef Dip</mark></mark>. so, i took a bite of my pasta and my pasta was dry, bland, and cold. it seemed like they left it out for a long time because the pasta was kind of stale. it was by far the worst meal i have eaten. no one in my party enjoyed their cold food. the food is over priced and they serve cold food. what i did notice yesterday night because i was sitting in front of the kitchen, was the food was coming out fast, but the food was standing there forever. i saw 4 dishes waiting there to be picked up for roughly 10 min. no wonder the food was getting cold! not enough runners to even bring the food out. horrible way to manage a business that can't have enough staff to bring out orders. i will never return here for the food. like a huge company like this, they should have already gotten their shit together. horrible.", 
            "came here for a friend's birthday because this is one of the few locations outside the strip that can accommodate a party of twenty. service was good and they sat us at the table immediately. we made a reservation beforehand. \n\nwe ordered a bunch of stuff so i got to try a little bit of everything. the sweet and sour \"chicken\" off the vegetarian menu was so good!  it's made out of soy but it's crunchy sweet and sticky. i also enjoyed the texture. i got to try the truffle burger and garlic fries. liked it both. it was good, nothing really special but definitely a solid burger. the fries are cut thin and they were generous with the garlic. i got the <mark>Angel Hair Pasta</mark> with all kinds of vegetables and olives in the half size. portion is a little small but i wasn't that hungry so it worked out. i enjoyed it but it wasn't my favorite dish. i kept eyeing other people's food. i think there's too many olives in it.  i also liked their korean steak dish with rice. it came with saut\\u00e9ed spinach that were delicious. \n\nsince it was a birthday they were nice enough to give the birthday girl a free dessert. ice cream and a brownie. they also split the check for 20 people. that's amazing!  love it when places can do that so you don't have to worry about calculating it and splitting the tips and tax. saved us the headache!  will definitely come back for their happy hour."

            "the first time coming here, i was pretty impressed that they had a vegetarian menu. that was already a plus for me. i came here with family that had come into town and almost all of us ordered vegetarian. we had hummus and pita, <mark>Truffle Fries</mark>, <mark><mark>Deviled Eggs</mark></mark>,the gardein <mark><mark>Gardein Orange Peel Chicken</mark></mark>, the gardein <mark>Penne with Chicken</mark>, and  hongos y rajas tacos. they were all really good. i was impressed. many places that offer vegetarian dishes mess them up by adding too much of something, whether it's tofu or vegetables. in this case, the gardein products were utilized perfectly. for dessert, we had a mini creme brulee, a mini peach apple <mark>Cobb</mark>, and a mini lemon souffle. this entire meal was demolished by my family. the only reason i gave it 4 stars is because i ordered root beer thinking that a place that makes their own beer would make their own homeade root beer and cream soda. sadly, they only had barq's root beer. what a disappointment! i will definitely come back and enjoy more selections next time.\n\n\nthat was my last review.\n\nhere's an update. last time i went to yardhouse, i ordered vegetarian jerk wings. they were pretty good until i realized the wings were definitely not vegetarian. that is a mistake a restaurant should never make. luckily, i'm not a customer who likes to cause problems since i work in the industry but i was shocked that happened. for that, i demoted yardhouse.", 
            "this is probably the best restaurant at town square in $$ range for food and drinks. i love going to this place, because its located right across from the movie theater. my friends and i usually go here for a movie and dinner night. food is amazing at this location.\n\n i am a big fan of chicken nahos, its just loaded <mark>Penne with Chicken</mark>, guac, beans, etc. its a great starter for a big group. hungry folks will devour it immediately. if you are going there with just another person, than don't get it. its too big for both, and you can't take it home cause it will get soggy. my favorite are their ahi sliders. they are just delicious. the fish is fresh and its hint of citrus. its a must have for anyone who's trying to eat healthy.   \n\nthey also have awesome beer selection, it could be bit more pricy than other local places, but the variety negates the higher price on beers. \n\noverall, if you are hungry and if you are anywhere near town square than go here. on weekends, if does get really busy so if you have a big party than you might end up waiting for 15-30 minutes. i am not sure if you can reserve ahead of time.", 
            "one of the best happy hours! the beer selection the best that i've seen and tasted in vegas! \n\ni eat not so healthy when i come here, but what goes great with beer? nachos loaded <mark>Penne with Chicken</mark>! their guac is good too.\n\nservice is okay. sometimes slow, but not bad.\n\ngreat place to try if you have the opportunity!", 
            "this is my go-to late night reverse happy hour location!! awesome menu, usual great service, and great happy hour prices!\n\nthis town square location my usual spot. i will on occasion go to the red rock location if i'm in that area. but town square is the go to. \n\nevery time i come, it's usually always busy. meaning i've never come on an empty night. still receive great service and seated within an acceptable amount of time. there are great for large parties! ***side note: if you have a large party, be patient with them some servers look and act annoyed** i've come in with a party over 30 and they always accommodate us. (we come after we  perform in shows) \n\nlike i said i love the reverse happy hour menu so honestly that's the only things i've ever tried... and their dessert! yummy! my absolute favorite is the garlic <mark><mark>Chicken Noodle</mark></mark>!!! i see it more as a meal than an appetizer! lo mein type noodles <mark>Penne with Chicken</mark> chunks accompanied by garlic flavor, edamame seeds, parmesan cheese toppings, shiitake mushrooms, chunks of tofu, and sliced asparagus!!! who wouldn't love that?! it's absolutely delicious and just the right amount of garlic flavor. \n\nall of their happy hour appetizers are a must try. their half off pizzas are delicious, and my other favorite go to meal is the ahi-<mark>Poke Stack</mark>. perfectly lightly wasabi coated ahi tuna chunks stacked on wonton wafers accompanied with carrot and radish slices all lightly coated in the soy and wasabi ginger sauce with slices of fresh avocado on the side!!  \n\nwhen i order just the <mark>Chicken <mark>Shiitake <mark>Lobster Garlic Noodles</mark></mark></mark> and the <mark>Poke Stack</mark> during happy hour, with tip and tax included i walk out paying $15. can't beat that!!! \n\nnot to mention to amazing beer selection they have available!! pear cider is my go to! \n\ntry everything on their appetizer menu! i promise they do not disappoint",

            "we cam in at 5p and waited for 15-20 min for our table.   guest everyone is coming here for the happy hours.  decorations look nice and the hostesses are friendly.   we ordered the following items:\n1. <mark>Moo Shu Egg Rolls</mark> -  love this and strongly recommend to try it out\n2. calamari -  too oily,  which i'm having a heart burn now. \n3. buffalo wings -  super spicy.   i guess i should have asked for light on sauce; still good to order\n4. <mark>Penne with Chicken</mark> -  it was kinda good.   too much sauce even though my daughter requested for less sauce. \n5. jambalaya with brown rice - can't feel the spice of jambalaya except for excessive sauce. \n6. lobster <mark>Chicken <mark>Shiitake <mark>Lobster Garlic Noodles</mark></mark></mark> -  too salty.  if not salty then this will be a perfect dish. \nanyhow, kid's <mark>Pepperoni Pizza</mark> was amaze. i like it more than my dish . \ni gave this four stars due to the taste of the food.   overall,  still recommend people to eat here.", 
            "it was my first time to have dinner at the yard house. after shopping at the town square, my friend and i got hungry, so we randomly picked a restaurant. when we get to the entrance of the yard house, we saw people walk in and out, and some of people were just gathering in front of the entrance. this restaurant was very busy that it took us about half an hour to get a seat. we sat in the restaurant booth, which is about 8ft from the bar. the design of the dinning room is pretty. the room is dark, but very comfortable. i ordered the small size <mark>Penne with Chicken</mark>, which is in the house favorite category. my friend ordered the small size <mark><mark>Bbq Chicken</mark></mark> salad. even though the restaurant was very busy, the service was very fast. it took only about 10 minutes for the dishes to be served. in the <mark>Penne with Chicken</mark>, the penne was nicely mixed with the asparagus, mushrooms, tomato, and cheese, and it also looked glossy. the size of the dish was about 12 to 16oz. the smell of the dishes is very good that it is not too strong but mild. the penne was smooth and a little bit creamy; it was slippery in the mouth. the chicken was tender, and its flavor was salty, a little acid, and creamy. the acid flavor of the tomato was balanced with the marsala cream sauce. the <mark><mark>Bbq Chicken</mark></mark> salad had a very fresh smell and bright colors. the fried onion had a weaker smell than the no fried one, and it was well mixed with other greens. the texture of the salad was crispy and moist. because avocado, tomato, beans, corn, cilantro, and pasilla were included in this dish, it had flavor of salty, sweet, acid, and spicy. the chicken of the salad had a little burnt taste. the size of the salad is big that we did not finish it even though the one we order was a small size. due to the good first impression, my friend and i would like plan for a return."

            "i love going to yard house.  great atmosphere in the awesome town square that i have come to know and love as the best part of las vegas.  in addition to their friendly staff, they also have great food!  you can't miss the mac and cheese2 (squared).   their entire menu is made up of comfort food, so if you are down to eat <mark>Roasted Turkey Pot Pie</mark> and all the staples that grandma used to make, you have come to the right place.  they have a huge beer list, but unfortunately there are no descriptions of the beers, just names.  however, their staff is always happy to make suggestions by asking what you like.  their awesome food and friendly staff plus the location is enough for me to give this place the elusive 5 star rating.", 
            "to start off, i will confess...i am already a big yard house fan. the main reason is it's spin on comfort food and enormous beer selection. that being said...town center yard house gets the fourth star rating because of it's proximity in relation to everything around: shopping, movies, and bars. \n\nhere, yard house is the perfect addition to a night out at the mall. \n- gone shopping? get a beer. \n- seen a movie? get some dinner. \n- headed to the blue martini for a natural vibrations concert? drink here first.\n\nthe ambiance here is always great: kind of like a dark super sized pub full of beer selections from around the country, hell even the world. \n\nthe food is as i said before, comfort food (or it could be the only things i decide to order). my usual order consists of either the mac and cheese squared, <mark>Roasted Turkey Pot Pie</mark>, or grilled cheese (with bacon and tomato)/tomato soup. the m&c2 is perfect, what more could one ask of pasta, cheese, bacon, chicken, and truffle oil...brilliance in every spoonful. <mark>Roasted Turkey Pot Pie</mark> is an entire plate of turkey, cream sauce, and veggies covered in a flaky fresh crust. and lastly, the grilled cheese is the perfect accompaniment of a cold day...or cold beer. speaking of beer, try the sampler. daily, the beers of choice switch up so enjoy the variety. \n\nservice is quick with the drinks, courteous, and fun to be around. \n\nyard house in town center exceptional. beware, place gets crowded pretty quick. give it a try and see how new age comfort food is made.", 
            "this place is good for big parties and i mean 20+ people. we had my bf's and his friend's birthday dinner few weeks ago and had so much fun. the servers were very friendly and accommodating. everyone ordered the yardstick($13 for 2 glasses of beer) while i drank my water since i wasn't in the mood to drink. i ordered the steak and shrimp which i rarely order but since we were splitting the check, it wouldn't be fair if i paid $66 dollars for a pizza or a chicken <mark>Roasted Turkey Pot Pie</mark>. which by the way, the chicken <mark>Roasted Turkey Pot Pie</mark> is huge! \noverall, the restaurant is spacious for big parties.\n\nmet up with my friend last night. ordered the calamari since i wasn't that hungry. i must say, not really a martini person since some bartenders make it really strong. but my friend introduced me to the georgia peach and hawaiian sunset and absolutely loved it! not too strong but a creeper, so beware. \nmy bf ordered the lobster burger and it was surprisingly delish! \nwe also had the same server from a couple of weeks ago which she also was fantastic!", 
            "this place, in my humble opinion, is a notch above chili's. it's got a lot of beer, a lot of tv's, and is a good place to watch football. save for the fact that they don't have chicken wings :(\n\ni got the steak and shrimp...steak was tougher than shoe leather. didn't finish it. shrimp were cooked right and the green beans were good. \n\nmom got grilled cheese & tomato soup.  hard to mess this up but i'm sure someone can. she was happy. tomato soup there is really good.\n\ndad was the winner, he go the <mark>Roasted Turkey Pot Pie</mark>. thing was amazingly huge and was very tasty. i'd hate to see the calories in the thing but he was happy.\n\nlobster mac-n-cheese is amazing there.  another friend got the <mark>Spicy Thai Chicken</mark> pizza, it was ok, but was lacking flavor in my opinion. i mean, it is thai after all.", 
            "nice big restaurant. although i like smaller restaurants a bit better. but the food is great. and the service super friendly & young & handsome:) the portions are huge. so 2 people of us shared and we were both full. we had the <mark>Roasted Turkey Pot Pie</mark> which was very yummy. the blue crab cake hoagie was very delicious too. i would come again.",

            "this place blows.  management came to my table to blow smoke about the amount of head there should be on my beer. the <mark>Roasted Turkey Pot Pie</mark> had only 4 pieces of turkey in it and so much salt in it, it raised my blood pressure. frys were cold, scallops were the size of nickels. i have eaten here 3 times before and never had this bad service or food. i am very disappointed in the service and management that thinks every one just fell off turnip truck.  very sad will stick with the linq location.  they seem to understand that if \"you don't take care of the customer,  someone else will\".",

(that's what i got.. mostly because i've always wanted to say \"can i get the <mark>Spicy Thai Chicken</mark> sandwich please?\" i've never been able to say that before!). its the gardein substitute for meat, a gluten-free, soy-based protein that is supposed to duplicate the flavor/taste/texture of meat. i thought it was delish. moist and very filling. the aioli was great too. don't be afraid of the cabbage (i was, i hate cabbage). it's a thin layer, quite sparse and the other flavors conceal the cabbage anyway. i'm not sure if this is a nv thing or a new feature at the chain, bc the last one i went to in so cal didn't have that many veggie options (they had the regular amount, just not a half of a page in the menu dedicated to soy protein (fake meat) dishes!!\n\ni'd love to give them 5 stars, i really wanted to. the staff was friendly, they called when the order was ready (i picked up), they even had the water i requested all ready to go... but the <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> weren't cooked all the way through. not all of them, at least. as a giant fan of <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>, that is disappointing. it means enough to knock off a star even though yh knocked my socks off with the veggie menu. so stoked about that!", 
            "yardhouse's  customer service is on point. they had messed up my order and the manager kindly went up to my table and apologized. the food was great as always! we started with the lobster <mark>Lobster, Crab & Artichoke Dip</mark>. there were way too many chips and pitts for a small dip size. the dip was tasty. we had the macaroni and cheese with <mark>Gardein Orange Peel Chicken</mark> with truffle sauce so yummy! my favorite! \n\nour only disappointment was that my bf's burger didn't have a bearnaise sauce.  and on the menu it says bernaise burger. it was just a reg burger he got. he was hungry so he just ate it. we didn't even tell our waiter.",

            "enjoyed my time here a lot. it's a cozy large restaurant with booth and table seating. i arrived here with my sister on a stifling hot monday afternoon. we were quickly seated at a table and greeted about five minutes later by our server seth, who brought out our hibiscus tea and water. he was efficient and friendly and made great menu recommendations. we don't eat much at one sitting so we went straight in and my sister ordered their <mark>Classic Cheese</mark> burger with fries and i ordered the <mark>Shrimp <mark><mark>Gardein Orange Peel Chicken</mark> Rice Bowl</mark></mark> with rice. one thing i noticed was their drink selection was enormous. drafts, cocktails, mixed drinks and margaritas you name it they know it. looked like a great happy hour spot if only we could've came at 10 pm. but it was ok, once our food came out i was very happy with my choice as i love veggies with my food and this place did a <mark>Chicken <mark>Shrimp <mark><mark>Gardein Orange Peel Chicken</mark> Rice Bowl</mark></mark></mark> with veggies and shrimp perfectly. since we were pressed for time we did not stay long but overall satisfied with the experience, i recommend going for happy hour on the weekdays so your server isn't rushed because i got that vibe a few times from the look of the servers there. would go for happy hour!", 
            "i've been coming here for years. i don't care for chain restaurants - and you'd never know yard houses are affiliated with the same company that manages red lobster.\n\ngreat beer selection, food options, and service. i love that you can eat late here - great for vegas hours.\n\ni have so many favorites here. <mark><mark><mark>Clam Chowder</mark></mark></mark>, duck fat fries, jambalaya, <mark>Miso Glazed Sea Bass</mark>, <mark><mark>Gardein Orange Peel Chicken</mark></mark>, <mark>Roasted Turkey Pot Pie</mark>, macadamia nut crusted mahi mahi, all of the <mark>Street Tacos</mark>, medium rare <mark>Rib Eye</mark> with broccolini, many of the asian dishes with bok choy and jasmine rice - and plenty of desert options too! \n\ni'm not sure i've been to a restaurant where i can choose from so much and be pleased with every option."

            "an all-inclusive place to hang out, eat, drink, and watch the latest sports on their multiple tvs!  with it being vegas, no dress code or cover charge means it will be very popular!\n\nwalking in on a saturday night, expect a wait of at least an hour because that's how long we waited for our party of four.  call ahead to get yourself on the list since they don't take reservations for parties less than 10!  if you're lucky, you can squeeze yourself over by the bar and try one of their 100 to 250 beers on tap.  they say they do offer the \"world's largest selection of draft beer.\"  you can order it by the pint or half yard, but watch out if you break the half yard glass; it'll cost you an extra $10!  but if you want a sampling, request their six-pack.  it's a weekly rotating variety of six different beers so you can get a taste of each.\n\nthe best seats are in the booths, which can fit five comfortably.  the tables in the middle are for the big parties, but you're constantly being bumped into as people and staff attempt to squeeze on by.\n\nwe went for a variety of appetizers to share:\n\n* grilled jamaican wings: \"tossed in jerk spices with rum bbq sauce\" $10.25 - a generous amount of wings, but not enough of that sauce.  full of flavor though and tasty!\n\n* firecracker wings: \"tossed in a spicy sesame garlic plum glaze\" $10.25 - favored over the jamaican wings because of the spice kicker.\n\n* grilled hearts of romaine: \"topped with red onions, candied walnuts and a gorgonzola champagne vinaigrette\" $8.95 - good enough to share with really nice walnuts and yummy dressing.  even the guys in our group were fighting over it!\n\n* baby leaf spinach: \"portabella mushrooms, red onions, smoked gouda, tomatoes, croutons, and balsamic vinaigrette\" $7.95 - not enough portabella mushrooms, but i like the gouda.\n\n* lobster, crab & <mark>Lobster, Crab & Artichoke Dip</mark>: \"main lobster, blue crab and artichoke hearts baked with a <mark>Four Cheese</mark> blend served with tortilla chips and grilled flat bread\" $11.45 - good dip, but not the most popular dish we ordered.\n\n* barnaise sliders: \"four mini burgers made from naturewell natural angus beef served with fried onions, barnaise sauce, fries and pickle $9.95 - the fried onions make it taste really good, although the side of barnaise sauce sure doesn't hurt.  even the thin fries taste good!\n\n* <mark>Classic Sliders</mark>: \"four mini burgers made from naturewell natural angus beef served with cheddar cheese, our house special sauce, fries and pickle\" $9.95 - only okay after you try the barnaise ones, stick to that one instead.  \n\n* fresh baked brownie: \"topped with mint chocolate chip, caramel or vanilla ice cream\" $7.95 - takes about fifteen minutes and meant for sharing.\n\n* draft beer float: \"lindeman's framboise with vanilla ice cream\" $6.50 - like a root beer float, but with lindeman's.\n\nthey do offer regular entrees like sandwiches, steaks, burgers, chicken, pizza, and seafood.  there's bound to be something on the menu for everyone, which makes this place a good choice.  the noise level is over the top though and you'll find yourself screaming to be heard.  (not exactly the best place for a date if you're sitting across from each other.  but a good place to check out people and possibly make some new friends.  we ran into quite a few people we knew that saturday night, so it's definitely a hopping place!)\n\nsince i'm still not a beer drinker, i like the yard house because they serve up lindeman's ($8, in a goblet) and wyder's.  i can drink something i enjoy while everyone else is having their rounds of beer.\n\nthey do offer happy hours: monday through friday, 3 pm to 6 pm; sunday through wednesday, 11 pm to close. select appetizers are half-priced and drinks are discounted.  after 11 pm on friday and saturday nights, it's 21 years and older.  the crowd does change a bit and the skirts become shorter.  there's even a line outside by then, so come in earlier and get yourself acquainted at the bar.\n\nthis place is kid-friendly since they do offer a kids' menu and their \"kids klub.\"  but you probably don't want to take them here on weekend nights.\n\nupdate! 05/31/08 - this time tried their (mac & cheese)2 \"roasted <mark>Southern Fried Chicken Breast</mark>, applewood bacon, wild mushrooms, cheddar and parmesan cheese with castellane pasta and white truffle oil.\"  next time, i'm going to skip the chicken because it's dried out.  but so yummy though when you get past the poultry part.", 
            "if the goal here was a great place to hang out, eat, drink, and have fun, it could nary have been executed better.  from the bachelor-pad-sheik decor and numerous large flatscreens, to the cute and friendly waitstaff, and who could forget, the wonderful food and huge beer selection, this place is a winner.\n\ni'm not sure what problems some other reviewers had with the kitchen at this place, but they were on top of their game the afternoon i dropped by.  the korean bbq appetizer didn't have as strong a garlic flavor as one would expect, but the meat was perfectly cooked, and the flavor of the meat shone through well.  the rice could have been stickier, though.\n\nthe burger i ordered medium was perfectly cooked, and wonderously tender and flavorful.  it certainly goes down as one of the better burgers i've ever had.  the fries were light and crispy, but could have been more numerous.  my friend ordered a very tasty upscale mac'n'cheese which came adorned with perfectly cooked and juicy <mark>Southern Fried Chicken Breast</mark> pieces.\n\nthe servers were very attentive, and made for a very nice overall experience.  this is definitely the kind of place for you, if you're looking for great food and a relaxed, fun enviornment, but a touch more upscale than that little local hole in the wall.  whether the goal is after-work unwinding, weekend playtime, or just a nice meal in a comfortable place, the yard house delivers.",

            "yeah, i forget what i ordered here.  i want to say...it was some pretty good <mark>Southern Fried Chicken Breast</mark> and mashed potatoes.  something tells me my husband would have loved this place.  tvs everywhere, helpful staff...really really good diet coke!\n\nall i remember was the sheer embarrassment of being the only person wearing a sparkly gold dress and a friggin bridal veil, only in vegas...except we're not on the strip, so now i'm totally self-conscious about a restaurant full of people staring at me...though not embarrassed of rolling deep with 14 hot girlfriends wearing tight black clothing.  taxi service is slow at this venue, especially on a saturday.  doesn't really matter because you're in vegas and after you're done, the rest of it just kind of fades to black, don't judge me...you know what i'm talking about."

            "i've tried most of the watering holes and food joints in and around town square.  of course, it is always a hit and miss.  i've tried miller's ale house on the opposite side of the outdoor mall also and i can say that yard house is, hands down, way better than ale house - in so many levels.  am not a big fan of chain or franchised restaurants and tend to be very judgmental of them.  \n\nmy friend was starving after watching the most recent superman movie at the rave, or amc theaters.  i blamed my friend for choosing ale house the last time because that was just a waste of a hard earned money so we went to yard house which is literally a few steps away from the cinema.  i wasn't very happy of the choice, but hey, i might as well give it a try. \n\nwe were quickly seated and drinks were served in a flash.  i ordered their <mark>Spicy Jambalaya</mark> with linguini instead of rice, and my friend ordered their parmesan crusted chicken.   my review is based on the food that i pig out on.  my friend liked the chicken too, more than the pork medallion (actually pork schnitzel) from ale house.  \n\nwe didn't wait long for our entrees.  the jambalaya pasta came tolerably hot.  good servings, if i may add.  it was reasonably seasoned.  not that spicy as i was expecting but there sure was some kind of a bite and kick because of the paprika, cheyenne pepper and cajun seasonings.  the dish was perfectly tossed in cajun sauce generously packed with small shrimps, roasted red and green peppers, fresh tomatoes, slivers of andouille sausage and topped with two grilled huge shrimps (mini prawns).  i remember having jambalaya pasta from cheesecake factory and claim jumpers decades ago and i thought they were good, but yard house's is better.  \n\nwe liked the way our server/waitress didn't bother us every 5 minutes or so asking how everything was.   we were left to enjoy and savor our food, and only came when necessary (refilling our drinks, clearing up our table and bringing in the check).  suffice to say, i finished my plate and was happy with it.  total damage for me was $25.00.  a bit pricey for a pasta dish but considering the ambience and the service, it wasn't that bad.",

            "i'm baaaaack. we gave yardhouse another try and our experience was definitely better - but the santana row location will always be home. \n\nwe decided to come for lunch and since the weather was beautiful we decided to sit outside. i have no idea why yardhouse does this but they sit people when their servers are at lunch. the logic makes no sense to me because how is there supposed to be service at a table when the server assigned to it is off the clock. right? i'm not sure either. this happened last time and it happened again. thankfully the server wasn't on lunch for a godly amount of time and we were actually able to get our order in in a timely manner.\n\nthe food seems really consistent location to location and you can't get me away from their french fries or  bbq ranch <mark>Gardein Bbq Chicken Salad</mark> but seating your customers in an area that won't get any service needs to change. until then, this place is still just \"ok\"", 
            "i have been here several times and had only good experiences so far. they have a huge selection of beers, several micro brews, and  lots of great food items. \n\nwe were a party of 6 last night and we sat out the patio. the service was very quick and friendly, although the place was mostly empty. our waiter was a bit of a low talker so it was very hard to hear him throughout the meal. \n\nwe sat outside on the patio and i ordered the <mark><mark>Bbq Chicken</mark></mark> salad which was excellent, little spicy but oh so good. this place is a great place to have a nice meal and a few drinks, while watching a game on tv. \n\ndef will be back for more.",

            "consistent food, drink and service! great go to spot. the only negative is their fried food is always cold. \ngreat snack food and the kung pow calamari is really good. black velvet is a staple drink as well. <mark><mark>Bbq Chicken</mark></mark> salad is good....", 
            "we came back due to having a gift card from the last time we were there...huge thank you to the manager for giving us a second try, or vice versa! \n\nwe had great service this time. wonderful service. the waiter trey gave us several suggestions and never seemed annoyed with all of our questions and never rushed us on ordering. when he went on break he brought in blair and introduced her...i thought that was very nice. she was awesome as well giving is more suggestions for our second round of drinks. \n\nwe ordered cocktails from their special menu in honor of the world cup...they were yummy and strong! our appetizer was the hawaiian <mark>Poke Stack</mark>. i could eat this for days! ahi tuna with carrot and dikon over flat fried wontons with an avacado and a very flavorful sauce on top. it was great.\n\nwe decided to get a pizza which we never get except from a pizza place. the <mark><mark>Bbq Chicken</mark></mark> with onion, cilantro and tangy sauce was what we ordered. overall the taste was on point. i wish i had ordered more sauce to go on top! my other half got <mark><mark><mark>Clam Chowder</mark></mark></mark> and said it was very hearty and had a to die for taste. \n\nwe were too full to get dessert this time. we can't wait to go back!", 
            "i came here for the first time on my girlfriend's behalf. she's always had positive things to say about this place, so i finally decided to go for it. the food was above average. i ordered the <mark>Lamb Burger</mark> and the barbecue <mark>Gardein Bbq <mark>Gardein Spicy Thai <mark>Bbq Chicken Pizza</mark></mark></mark>. for the food, i give it a 7.5/10. i'd rate this place four stars if it were solely based on food, but that isn't the case. the service was 'meh.' our waiter ignored us on multiple occasions and disregarded us. it took four tries to get a refill on water. it was as if he looked down on us (probably because we're younger.) you'd think all consumers would be treated equally without stereotypes, but i guess that's not the case here at yard house! good food. bad service.", 
            "the food gets 4 stars. i was quite impressed for it being mainly a bar scene. i got the <mark>Gardein Spicy Thai <mark>Bbq Chicken Pizza</mark></mark> and my girlfriend got the <mark>Pepperoni Pizza</mark>. the dessert was a straight home run. got the smores brownie. we ordered 2 and the server only bought out one. he admitted to making a mistake but i actually thanked him because 2 would have been way too much. i ordered it with a side of chocolate mint ice cream. delicious! \n\n2 stars for the overall seating situation. they weren't that busy (many visible tables open) and they took 45 minutes to seat a table of 6. i was disappointed with that. \n\noverall good experience. i definitely recommend going. hopefully you get seated sooner to enjoy the good food.", 
            "it was my first time to have dinner at the yard house. after shopping at the town square, my friend and i got hungry, so we randomly picked a restaurant. when we get to the entrance of the yard house, we saw people walk in and out, and some of people were just gathering in front of the entrance. this restaurant was very busy that it took us about half an hour to get a seat. we sat in the restaurant booth, which is about 8ft from the bar. the design of the dinning room is pretty. the room is dark, but very comfortable. i ordered the small size <mark>Penne with Chicken</mark>, which is in the house favorite category. my friend ordered the small size <mark><mark>Bbq Chicken</mark></mark> salad. even though the restaurant was very busy, the service was very fast. it took only about 10 minutes for the dishes to be served. in the <mark>Penne with Chicken</mark>, the penne was nicely mixed with the asparagus, mushrooms, tomato, and cheese, and it also looked glossy. the size of the dish was about 12 to 16oz. the smell of the dishes is very good that it is not too strong but mild. the penne was smooth and a little bit creamy; it was slippery in the mouth. the chicken was tender, and its flavor was salty, a little acid, and creamy. the acid flavor of the tomato was balanced with the marsala cream sauce. the <mark><mark>Bbq Chicken</mark></mark> salad had a very fresh smell and bright colors. the fried onion had a weaker smell than the no fried one, and it was well mixed with other greens. the texture of the salad was crispy and moist. because avocado, tomato, beans, corn, cilantro, and pasilla were included in this dish, it had flavor of salty, sweet, acid, and spicy. the chicken of the salad had a little burnt taste. the size of the salad is big that we did not finish it even though the one we order was a small size. due to the good first impression, my friend and i would like plan for a return.", 
            "one of my favorite restaurants of all time! this is one of the places where pretty much anything that you order will be delicious! they also carry my favorite beer: the house belgian amber triple! delicious if you like a darker brew with a soft after taste. i highly recommend the <mark>Gardein Bbq Chicken Salad</mark> and their garlic fries! mmmm! i probably go here once a week!",

            "i don't know if the yard house at town center is typical of other yard house locations... but my first impression of the one at town center is \"wow! the largest bar / sports bar i've ever been to!\" the bar must have been forty yards long with a circular seating arrangement... that's almost a football field length of seating just to consume liquor or watch your favorite team on one of the lcd tvs. don't feel comfortable at the \"bar\"? ... well there's dimly lit table seating around the extremities of the interior of the yard house, as well as outside seating under a covered patio.\n\nif you're not consuming your liquor at happy hour here at the yard house... you have a lot more money to spare than i do, or you're just being extravagant for no rational reason. lindeman's framboise at only $4.00 a glass! raspberry cider, also at the same price! and, the happy hour extends late into the night...\n\nas for the food... specifically the appetizers... the menu needs work...\n\n  <mark>Spicy Thai Chicken</mark> pizza (*) first of all, it's a thin-crust pizza.. a \n      negative already! carrots, green onion, cilantro, mozzarella, \n      macadamia nuts, and firecracker sauce as a topping... essentially \n      very, very close to a vegan pizza. prior apologies to all vegans... \n      yecch!\n  chicken lettuce wrap (**** 1/2) stir fried, smoked tofu, pine nuts and \n      green onions with three dipping sauces with a meat choice of either \n      chicken, tiger shrimp, or shiitake and portabella mushrooms. very, \n      very good. \n  <mark>Onion Ring Tower</mark> (****) beer battered and dusted with parmesan \n      cheese... served with chipotle and ranch dip sauces. and... i don't \n      even like onion rings... that's saying a lot for the perfectly made \n      onion rings!\n  <mark>Chicken Nachos</mark> (**) thin, and i mean thin tortilla chips with cheddar \n      and jack cheese, tomato, cilantro, onions, guacamole and spicy \n      whole pinto beans. chips were deteriorating as we sat. word to the \n      wise... consume this appetizer quickly, or it just turns into mush. \n      definitely, not as good as one of the many cheap, late-night taquerias \n      you can find around las vegas.\n  <mark>Fried Calamari</mark> (**** 1/2) an appetizer which i never order because most \n      restaurants usually over-fry the calamari where it becomes \n      super-tough and chewy... but not that night when we consumed it! \n      served with spicy tomato and tartar sauces.\n  <mark>Spicy Tuna Roll</mark> (**) definitely, not a favorite at the table. not enough \n      tuna, maybe? or it could've been the odd mixture of textures with an \n      almost crunchy edamame. <mark>Pan Seared Ahi</mark> tuna with avocado, edamame, \n      cucumber and wasabi soy sauce.\n  <mark>Classic Sliders</mark> (***) nothing special here. four mini burgers made from \n      naturewell natural angus beef served with cheddar cheese, house \n      special sauce, fries and pickle. preparation of the fries were better \n      than the sliders!\n\ndo you know what it takes to transport all the liquor over to the bar area? as i was looking around yard house to take some pics... i noticed the shiny pipes running along the ceiling emanating from the entrance area of yard house heading off in the direction of the bar. there are, literally, dozens of pipes that feed liquor to the bar stored in an orange-hued room ( http://static.px.yelp.com/bphoto/uxe7cbax8_9h82ljsg2jxw/l ) ( http://static.px.yelp.com/bphoto/a1ufhhyumxc145flbncylw/l ) to the left of the entrance as you walk in. moving that much liquor takes quite a bit of technology!\n\nliquor @ happy hour (*****)\nappetizers (***)\n\ndessert? not tonight. went back to my son's house for guava cake ( http://www.yelp.com/biz/akis-bakery-san-jose#hrid:nkspkohhhesyqkf1wn_nog ), which i brought over from san jose...", 
            "went here for a dinner with 2 other couples for my hubbies birthday after a cmye yelp event. i couldn't decide since the menu is good sized, and everything sounded really good. they have \"snacks\" around $3 - $5, appetizers $6-10 and entrees $10+. i decided on the waitress' recommendation of the <mark>Spicy Thai Chicken</mark> sandwich on flat bread with truffle fires. i guess it depends what you order, the burgers and sandwiches come with a side, but not sure about other items. my sandwich was amazing. i did add avocado to it too! i was stuffed at the end and it wasn't a healthy meal but it wasn't heavy either. i'd definitely go back. remember if you are ordering mixed drinks to say \"light ice\" or you will get 3/4 cup ice and a few drops of alcohol :p", 
            "i've been here a couple times before, but once i turned 21 this has been one of my go-to spots for happy hour because the specials are amazing! the fact that they have mini take home happy hour menus makes it all the more tempting as well. \n\nallow me break it down for you:\nhappy hour is mon-fri 3pm-6pm, sun-wed 10pm-close\n\ndomestic pints - $3.50, craft&import pints - $4.25-$4.75\nsliders served on a bed of fries  ($6.75): classic, bearnaise, pastrami, turkey, veggie. ahi is $9.95\n\nhalf priced pizzas: <mark><mark>Bbq Chicken</mark></mark>, 4cheese, ham & pineapple, margherita, pepperoni & mushroom, <mark>Spicy Thai Chicken</mark>\n\nhalf priced apps: <mark>Blue Crab Cakes</mark>, calamari, cali roll, chinese <mark>Chicken <mark>Shiitake <mark>Lobster Garlic Noodles</mark></mark></mark>, <mark>Chicken Nachos</mark>, <mark>Onion Ring Tower</mark>, wings, boneless wings, veggie wings, hawaiian <mark>Poke Stack</mark>, <mark>Spicy Tuna Roll</mark>, seared <mark>Ahi Sashimi </mark>, chicken <mark>Lettuce Wraps</mark>, <mark><mark>Gardein Fried Chicken Strips</mark></mark>, <mark>Spinach Cheese Dip</mark>, <mark>Moo Shu Egg Rolls</mark>\n\ndoesn't that just blow your mind? it's like a plethora of cheap happy hour eats and you'll probably get full off of one order of sliders, or 2 of their apps. \n\nso far i've tried:\n-bearnaise sliders (bearnaise sauce and fried shoestring onions on the patty w/ a side of very skinny fries that are tenderly cooked with a very light batter coating which gives them a perfectly crunchy exterior and \"juicy\" inside)\n-<mark><mark>Bbq Chicken</mark></mark> and <mark>Margherita Pizza</mark> (they pretty much taste as they should. sometimes the <mark><mark>Bbq Chicken</mark></mark> is a little too saucy for my taste though)\n-calamari (yum. perfectly fried on the outside and melting on the inside. served w/ marinara and, i wanna say tartar sauce? i usually go with the red..)\n-traditional wings (first and last time i had these, they were so spicy! my bf couldn't even handle them and he claims to love hot stuff, hehe. the thing that i don't like about these wings is that you can't choose how spicy you want them, so you have to be prepared for whatever they give you)\n\neverything i've tried has been pretty good so far and there is still so much more i have yet to try! i know my boyfriend has been having some sort of frenzy over the happy hour <mark>Poke Stack</mark>. he's gone to this location about 4 times in the past month, by himself, just to sit and eat the <mark>Poke Stack</mark>, so i can only guess how delicious it must be. \n\nkey points:\n-happy hour is awesome here\n-traditional wings are hot! (at least for me)\n-calamari is delectable\n-french fries are close to perfect\n-great for groups\n-service has been pretty fast on the days that i've gone", 
            "mitch was my server, and he was the best ever.\n\ni came here the other day while i was on a short family visit.   my mom was looking for a dress in town square, and we decided to lunch at yard house.  generally i am a difficult person to eat with because of my dietary restrictions, but thanks to mitch my life was made easier.\n\nyard house, a veggie/vegan portion of the menu that has mock meat dishes.  this basicall means, you can can get most the items with meat on the menu, with veggie meat instead.  \n\ni had a grilled <mark>Spicy Thai Chicken</mark> sandwich on sourdough, with fries.  it was good,  not huge (which is good), and it came with fries...the yard house fries are so good, since they use truffle oil.  yay!  at the time i ordered my server wasn't sure if everything was 100 percent vegan, without having to ask he went out of his way to make sure i was eating no animal products. (thank you!).  having a server check with out asking is amazing.  no one ever does it, and nothing spoils a meal like hidden animal bits.  \n\ni will come back here again, especially when i am with family or other meat eaters.  a great place for non adventurous eaters.", 
            "this is always a convenient spot to drop by at town square for happy hour or a drink to cool yourself down from walking around town square in 100f+, or while you're waiting to watch a movie.\n\ni like that they have framboise on tap and i'm a fan of that.  the half price happy hour items feature their regular appetizers that come in full portion.  the tuna tartare stack or <mark><mark>California Roll</mark></mark> (a stack of avacado, edamame and raw spicy tuna) are great.  their <mark>Spicy Thai Chicken</mark> pizza is a great beer food item.  <mark>Chicken Nachos</mark> is also good if you can handle the portion.\n\ni used to go to blue martini upstairs a lot more but since they changed the menu yardhouse just became a better choice.", 
            "so let me say that mitch who was our server was awesome!  my sister is vegan & they have a whole section on their menu of vegetarian options.  he went back to the kitchen to ensure that the product was purely vegan!  not only that he was very accommodating with her order.  (she got the gardin <mark>Spicy Thai Chicken</mark> sandwich).  she said it was tasty & would come back.  i had the <mark>Turkey Burger</mark> which was one of the best tasting burgers i've had in a long time.  since i didn't want fries mitch patiently ran down my other options until i decided (on mixed veggies which were crisp & not covered in butter & crap).  my mom got the beef sliders & she was very pleased.  we will all come back again since the service was fab & they are vegan friendly!", 
            "i've been to town square many of times but never stepped foot inside of yard house til now. the resturaunt was huge and the staff was very friendly and welcoming. smiles and good times was all over the building, not only from the staff but also the customers.\n\nthe food was amazing and if you're a beer lover such as myself they have over 100 brews to choose from. the selection included everything from lagers to ale's and even mixed beer drinks if you want to mix raspberry lindermans framboise w/ a chocolate flavored beer. and worse case scenario, let's say that you can't make up your mind on a beer selection; they also have samples of every brew to find the perfect one for your taste buds... i prefer peroni.\n\nthe dinner was delicious. my girlfriend ordered a <mark>Spicy Thai Chicken</mark> flatbread sandwich with parmesan & herb fries. i had to take a bite lol, and that was bomb.com! chicken was grilled to perfection with avacado, cabbage, and spicy mustard. i ordered the <mark>BBQ Bacon Cheddar</mark> burger! heaven on earth. 1/2 lb sirloin cooked to order, melted cheddar cheese, smoked applewood bacon on a sweet hawaiian bun and <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> on the side. best burger i've ever had hands down.\n\nthe only downer i seen about the place is that its extremely loud inside of yard house. i'm not knocking anyone's fun but it was hard to carry a convo with my girlfriend without shouting at eachother and we're sitting next to eachother in a booth. but there's also outside dining so that probably could've been more peaceful to enjoy a nice elegant dinner. definitely is the spot if you're having a nice date and get hungry :-)", 
            "this place, in my humble opinion, is a notch above chili's. it's got a lot of beer, a lot of tv's, and is a good place to watch football. save for the fact that they don't have chicken wings :(\n\ni got the steak and shrimp...steak was tougher than shoe leather. didn't finish it. shrimp were cooked right and the green beans were good. \n\nmom got grilled cheese & tomato soup.  hard to mess this up but i'm sure someone can. she was happy. tomato soup there is really good.\n\ndad was the winner, he go the <mark>Roasted Turkey Pot Pie</mark>. thing was amazingly huge and was very tasty. i'd hate to see the calories in the thing but he was happy.\n\nlobster mac-n-cheese is amazing there.  another friend got the <mark>Spicy Thai Chicken</mark> pizza, it was ok, but was lacking flavor in my opinion. i mean, it is thai after all.", 
            "visit on 1/21/12\n\nnormally i experience a 4 at the yard house but this experience was a 2 at best...i'm giving them a 3 for benefit of the doubt.  service was s  l  oooooooooow... it was semi-busy but we have been there at busier times.  we started with the onion rings-tasty as usual.  my husband ordered the <mark>Grilled Pastrami</mark> which he said was very good.  i had the <mark>Spicy Thai Chicken</mark> noodle salad.  there was a generous serving of perfectly grilled <mark><mark>Gardein Fried Chicken Strips</mark></mark> on the salad.  the noodles were slightly tough but otherwise a tasty dish.\n\nthe music was extremely loud during our visit.  we gave up on talking.  getting our check took at least 10 minutes until my husband had to ask another passing waiter.", 
            "i love yard house. there atmosphere, the snooty bartenders, the great food and delicious drinks.. what's not to love. \n\nthey have a bunch of vegetarian options here! it's amazing. veggie \"beef\" sliders.. \"chicken\" <mark>Chicken <mark>Shrimp <mark><mark>Gardein Orange Peel Chicken</mark> Rice Bowl</mark></mark></mark>.. spicy \"chicken\" sandwich.. (that's what i got.. mostly because i've always wanted to say \"can i get the <mark>Spicy Thai Chicken</mark> sandwich please?\" i've never been able to say that before!). its the gardein substitute for meat, a gluten-free, soy-based protein that is supposed to duplicate the flavor/taste/texture of meat. i thought it was delish. moist and very filling. the aioli was great too. don't be afraid of the cabbage (i was, i hate cabbage). it's a thin layer, quite sparse and the other flavors conceal the cabbage anyway. i'm not sure if this is a nv thing or a new feature at the chain, bc the last one i went to in so cal didn't have that many veggie options (they had the regular amount, just not a half of a page in the menu dedicated to soy protein (fake meat) dishes!!\n\ni'd love to give them 5 stars, i really wanted to. the staff was friendly, they called when the order was ready (i picked up), they even had the water i requested all ready to go... but the <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> weren't cooked all the way through. not all of them, at least. as a giant fan of <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>, that is disappointing. it means enough to knock off a star even though yh knocked my socks off with the veggie menu. so stoked about that!", 
            "went here last evening and it was super busy. waited about 15 minutes to be seated and then we were placed at a table which was right between the bar and some booths. which were both packed.\n\nso it was super. fucking. noisy. which was great for my anxiety!\n\nfood wise, we got the macaroni and cheese which i thought was really good. and we also got the <mark>Spicy Thai Chicken</mark> pizza off of the gardenia menu. i was pretty impressed with all the things on the vegetarian menu, and they even have little v's next to the food names to indicate it is animal free. the <mark>Spicy Thai Chicken</mark> of course was not real chicken, not sure what brand they use and forgot to ask, but it was really amazing.\n\nthe waiter was cool, and frequently came back to check on us and brought our food out pretty fast despite the amount of traffic there was.\n\nthe only i recommend is, if you hate people, don't come here!\n\n it's super loud, you'll have to shout out your waiter to get them to hear you. by the end of the night i wanted to cry cause the sound was unbearable. but that's just cause i'm a weirdo! everyone else seemed to be having a good time.",

            "this place is always pretty awesome with a decent wait time. i like it a little less than the one by the linq because the service is just a little less up to par. the prices seem identical to other yardhouses in the area and the atmosphere seems the same.\n\ni do have one main complaint. my last time i was served here.my waiter seemed confused as to what i was saying as if i had a hearing problem. i asked for pepper for my <mark>Chicken Noodle Soup</mark>, and he thought i said the opposite.\n\nhe then promptly walked away without me having the chance to correct him. he never truly took the time to ensure our orders were correct. for instance, we were brought the wrong beer and had to have another server fix the mistake.\n\nunfortunately, i do not recall his name, but he was a young tall man with long hair. \n\nalthough i just ranted about service, you must know that the food is incredible. i love the <mark>Grilled Korean Pork Belly</mark> tacos, the <mark>Blue Crab Cakes</mark>, and <mark>Spicy Thai Chicken</mark> pizza. i'll always come back here for a good happy hour special.",

            "an all-inclusive place to hang out, eat, drink, and watch the latest sports on their multiple tvs!  with it being vegas, no dress code or cover charge means it will be very popular!\n\nwalking in on a saturday night, expect a wait of at least an hour because that's how long we waited for our party of four.  call ahead to get yourself on the list since they don't take reservations for parties less than 10!  if you're lucky, you can squeeze yourself over by the bar and try one of their 100 to 250 beers on tap.  they say they do offer the \"world's largest selection of draft beer.\"  you can order it by the pint or half yard, but watch out if you break the half yard glass; it'll cost you an extra $10!  but if you want a sampling, request their six-pack.  it's a weekly rotating variety of six different beers so you can get a taste of each.\n\nthe best seats are in the booths, which can fit five comfortably.  the tables in the middle are for the big parties, but you're constantly being bumped into as people and staff attempt to squeeze on by.\n\nwe went for a variety of appetizers to share:\n\n* grilled jamaican wings: \"tossed in jerk spices with rum bbq sauce\" $10.25 - a generous amount of wings, but not enough of that sauce.  full of flavor though and tasty!\n\n* firecracker wings: \"tossed in a spicy sesame garlic plum glaze\" $10.25 - favored over the jamaican wings because of the spice kicker.\n\n* grilled hearts of romaine: \"topped with red onions, candied walnuts and a gorgonzola champagne vinaigrette\" $8.95 - good enough to share with really nice walnuts and yummy dressing.  even the guys in our group were fighting over it!\n\n* baby leaf spinach: \"portabella mushrooms, red onions, smoked gouda, tomatoes, croutons, and balsamic vinaigrette\" $7.95 - not enough portabella mushrooms, but i like the gouda.\n\n* lobster, crab & <mark>Lobster, Crab & Artichoke Dip</mark>: \"main lobster, blue crab and artichoke hearts baked with a <mark>Four Cheese</mark> blend served with tortilla chips and grilled flat bread\" $11.45 - good dip, but not the most popular dish we ordered.\n\n* barnaise sliders: \"four mini burgers made from naturewell natural angus beef served with fried onions, barnaise sauce, fries and pickle $9.95 - the fried onions make it taste really good, although the side of barnaise sauce sure doesn't hurt.  even the thin fries taste good!\n\n* <mark>Classic Sliders</mark>: \"four mini burgers made from naturewell natural angus beef served with cheddar cheese, our house special sauce, fries and pickle\" $9.95 - only okay after you try the barnaise ones, stick to that one instead.  \n\n* fresh baked brownie: \"topped with mint chocolate chip, caramel or vanilla ice cream\" $7.95 - takes about fifteen minutes and meant for sharing.\n\n* draft beer float: \"lindeman's framboise with vanilla ice cream\" $6.50 - like a root beer float, but with lindeman's.\n\nthey do offer regular entrees like sandwiches, steaks, burgers, chicken, pizza, and seafood.  there's bound to be something on the menu for everyone, which makes this place a good choice.  the noise level is over the top though and you'll find yourself screaming to be heard.  (not exactly the best place for a date if you're sitting across from each other.  but a good place to check out people and possibly make some new friends.  we ran into quite a few people we knew that saturday night, so it's definitely a hopping place!)\n\nsince i'm still not a beer drinker, i like the yard house because they serve up lindeman's ($8, in a goblet) and wyder's.  i can drink something i enjoy while everyone else is having their rounds of beer.\n\nthey do offer happy hours: monday through friday, 3 pm to 6 pm; sunday through wednesday, 11 pm to close. select appetizers are half-priced and drinks are discounted.  after 11 pm on friday and saturday nights, it's 21 years and older.  the crowd does change a bit and the skirts become shorter.  there's even a line outside by then, so come in earlier and get yourself acquainted at the bar.\n\nthis place is kid-friendly since they do offer a kids' menu and their \"kids klub.\"  but you probably don't want to take them here on weekend nights.\n\nupdate! 05/31/08 - this time tried their (mac & cheese)2 \"roasted <mark>Southern Fried Chicken Breast</mark>, applewood bacon, wild mushrooms, cheddar and parmesan cheese with castellane pasta and white truffle oil.\"  next time, i'm going to skip the chicken because it's dried out.  but so yummy though when you get past the poultry part.", 
            "one of the best happy hours on \"the boulevard\" better yet in the vegas valley.  happy hour runs from mon-fri 3pm to 6pm and sun-wed 10pm to close. half price select apps. and certain beers and martinis are also at a discount. beware, that during happy hour, the place is packed wall to wall wall with people. so, if you want to make in time for happy hour, i suggest coming right at three or not to long after three. they also have really good pizza. my favorite is the <mark>Four Cheese</mark>. i've also tried the <mark><mark>Bbq Chicken</mark></mark> pizza, but the bbq does not go to well with the pizza. the mac and cheese is off the hook. just also know, cell phone service is unlikely.", 
            "sad to say that i went on a friday during lent so i had the <mark>Four Cheese</mark> pizza rather than my usual meat filled p<mark>Latte</mark>. the pizza was pretty darn good though and huge considering during happy hour it only cost 6.50. talk about a deal! my roomie had the cuban sandwich and said it was amazing. overall the food tasted pretty great and if you during happy hour i really think it's hard to beat this level of food for this price. a lot of places serve really small portions for their lunch specials or happy hour but i think this place does it right and gives you huge portions hoping you stay around long enough to drink up a nice tab. i for one am willing to fall into this trap any day of the week as long as their food stays on point. last star is missing because although the service was acceptable it wasn't star worthy. \n\ngreat food, good size portions, happy hour makes their food cheap so plan accordingly.\n\n(spinach and <mark>Spinach Cheese Dip</mark> is pretty awesome btw.)", 
            "having finished up with a few errands and hunger took all decision making skills from the wife and i, we settled on yard house, as we hadn't been there in a while and the food seemed good on previous visits.\n\nwe were told it would be 15-20 minutes for a table in the very packed restaurant, no problem, we will enjoy the padded seats for a bit. by the time we sat down and got comfortable, our pager went off, and to the table we ventured.\n\nweaving through groves of people, we arrived at a table toward the back of the restaurant, furthest from the kitchen. i think the host was trying to talk to us during the trip, however, it is so ungodly loud in there, that i couldn't hear a word he was saying.\n\nflipping through the menu, neither of us remembered it being that expensive and of course, our lack of decision making skills due to hunger kicked in again and nothing looked good.\n\ni, for the second time in the night, settled and chose the <mark>Four Cheese</mark> pizza. one type of food that i had expressly stated i did not want prior to arriving. oh well, can't win them all.\n\nit seemed to take forever for our server to bring two glasses of water, almost as if they made her go to lake mead, fill a jug with water, bring it to a purification center, then make some ice cubes and finally, deliver filled ice water glasses to our table.\n\nour orders were taken and again, it seemed like an eternity for the food to get delivered. it was an ok pizza, about what you would expect from a non-pizza-centric establishment. i did find it odd though, that the crust was soaked with grease or water or something, and was as flimsy as a wet noodle.\n\nfinishing the food, the service seemed to pick up, plates were cleared almost the instant they were clean, the check was dropped off, a moment later, was picked up, with our payment. then... the waiting began again. i think yard house makes the staff bring the credit cards to the issuing bank to extract their funds.\n\nonce we were able to reclaim our card and head to the exit, the wife was almost bowled over by an employee that was on a mission. escaping into the very windy night, we both agreed this was our last visit to yard house for the foreseeable future."

            "talk about a beer lovers heaven. can you say 150 beers on tap? i can't hear you! well, if that doesn't sell you then the diverse menu options are sure to. and if you still aren't convinced, imagine big delicious portions and an amazingly generous happy hour menu. two friends and i recently enjoyed a late evening dining experience: <mark>Chicken Nachos</mark>, <mark>Margherita Pizza</mark>, bernaise sliders, <mark>Grilled Cheese & <mark><mark><mark>Organic Tomato Bisque</mark></mark></mark></mark>, 2 beers and a martini = under $50 with tip. \n\ngreat atmosphere and plenty of tvs for those who want less conversation and more game time. when the weather is nice, grab a seat outdoors and enjoy some people watching. even when the weather isn't so nice (just for a few short months in las vegas) there are conveniently located outdoor heaters, as in they are out of your way and you won't burn yourself after stumbling out because you sampled all 150 beers.\n\nto my not-so-crazy-about-beer-people: take it from someone who doesn't care for beer. do you like juice? carbonation perhaps? i highly recommend giving the lidemans framboise or strawberry fruli a try. i promise you won't even notice its beer. if that doesn't work out yardhouse has a great selection of mixed drinks and martinis. try the gobbstopper martini or the black orchid martini. \n\nand remember people: always drink responsibly :)", 
            "i've been here a couple times before, but once i turned 21 this has been one of my go-to spots for happy hour because the specials are amazing! the fact that they have mini take home happy hour menus makes it all the more tempting as well. \n\nallow me break it down for you:\nhappy hour is mon-fri 3pm-6pm, sun-wed 10pm-close\n\ndomestic pints - $3.50, craft&import pints - $4.25-$4.75\nsliders served on a bed of fries  ($6.75): classic, bearnaise, pastrami, turkey, veggie. ahi is $9.95\n\nhalf priced pizzas: <mark><mark>Bbq Chicken</mark></mark>, 4cheese, ham & pineapple, margherita, pepperoni & mushroom, <mark>Spicy Thai Chicken</mark>\n\nhalf priced apps: <mark>Blue Crab Cakes</mark>, calamari, cali roll, chinese <mark>Chicken <mark>Shiitake <mark>Lobster Garlic Noodles</mark></mark></mark>, <mark>Chicken Nachos</mark>, <mark>Onion Ring Tower</mark>, wings, boneless wings, veggie wings, hawaiian <mark>Poke Stack</mark>, <mark>Spicy Tuna Roll</mark>, seared <mark>Ahi Sashimi </mark>, chicken <mark>Lettuce Wraps</mark>, <mark><mark>Gardein Fried Chicken Strips</mark></mark>, <mark>Spinach Cheese Dip</mark>, <mark>Moo Shu Egg Rolls</mark>\n\ndoesn't that just blow your mind? it's like a plethora of cheap happy hour eats and you'll probably get full off of one order of sliders, or 2 of their apps. \n\nso far i've tried:\n-bearnaise sliders (bearnaise sauce and fried shoestring onions on the patty w/ a side of very skinny fries that are tenderly cooked with a very light batter coating which gives them a perfectly crunchy exterior and \"juicy\" inside)\n-<mark><mark>Bbq Chicken</mark></mark> and <mark>Margherita Pizza</mark> (they pretty much taste as they should. sometimes the <mark><mark>Bbq Chicken</mark></mark> is a little too saucy for my taste though)\n-calamari (yum. perfectly fried on the outside and melting on the inside. served w/ marinara and, i wanna say tartar sauce? i usually go with the red..)\n-traditional wings (first and last time i had these, they were so spicy! my bf couldn't even handle them and he claims to love hot stuff, hehe. the thing that i don't like about these wings is that you can't choose how spicy you want them, so you have to be prepared for whatever they give you)\n\neverything i've tried has been pretty good so far and there is still so much more i have yet to try! i know my boyfriend has been having some sort of frenzy over the happy hour <mark>Poke Stack</mark>. he's gone to this location about 4 times in the past month, by himself, just to sit and eat the <mark>Poke Stack</mark>, so i can only guess how delicious it must be. \n\nkey points:\n-happy hour is awesome here\n-traditional wings are hot! (at least for me)\n-calamari is delectable\n-french fries are close to perfect\n-great for groups\n-service has been pretty fast on the days that i've gone", 
            "i have been here 3 times in the past 9 months and the food is great!  i actually work in town square and will definitely be coming back more often.  the first time i ate there i sat at the bar, ordered the lunch special <mark>Margherita Pizza</mark> with a ceaser salad. it was great!  the second time was last saturday and i ordered the grilled shrimp and was very disappointed at the small amount of food i got on the grilled shrimp plate (for 15.00) but it was very good.  i went back the next day, ordered <mark>Chicken Nachos</mark> for 12.00 and the plate was huge. the food tasted very fresh and every bite was delectable!  their beer selection is incredible and i can tell they clean their taps often.  the waiter experiences were good 2 out of 3 times.its hard to find good food that tastes fresh in vegas and this is my new addiction"

            "pop quiz: how sad is it that eating at this yard house was one of my most anticipated moments before getting on the plane and heading out to las vegas for a few days? gambling, glitz, girls and other words that start with \"g\" are all fine and dandy, but sometimes a guy just wants to down a few beers, chomp on some outstanding food and unwind in a place where not everyone is a raging tourist carrying an over-sized plastic drink that is watered down and reeks of desperation. this is that place.\n\nmy folks and i actually made it over here before they opened on a monday morning and people were already lined up at 10:50 a.m. that's cool, right? this place clearly has a faithful audience, as evidenced by this review. and once those doors opened, shoot: it's like the customers in line thought the first 10 people in the door got a free unicorn that performs karaoke exclusively to hair metal songs. they rushed the door with a fervent desire to be first in and we just sort of meandered in after them. it's a big place with plenty of seats - there's no point in scrambling over each other to be the first one in. there's a lengthy patio, a surrounded bar and more seating than the average bar would know what to do with.\n\na hostess guided us to a booth opposite a table of nine individuals who exemplified the \"money cannot buy class\" rule. we overheard them tell the waitress they had to be out of there to catch a movie so right away you could tell this had potential to be the table from hell. we already felt for this gal and then we realized she was waiting on us, too! let it be known that tasha, our waitress, got the mvp award for eternity during this shift because when the place opened, it appeared she got triple sat right out of the gate. now i'm not an expert in the service industry but i know how hard it is to recover from a hand dealt like that in the opening minutes. we assured her we were in no rush, mostly because we weren't, and partly because we did not want to witness a breakdown on the floor. to her credit, she kept her cool and was efficient as she was sassy.\n\nspeaking of keeping cool, you might want to psych yourself up before eating here because the menu is positively dickensian with its verbiage. six pages of beer alone?! no, you have not died and gone to heaven; you just happened to wander into a place thriving with variety. being that we stopped in for lunch, we stuck with sandwiches and the must-have lunch combo: a cup of soup and half a sandwich/pizza. mom's <mark>Grilled Chicken & Avocado</mark> sandwich was polished off with ease, dad's... whatever dad ate, was equally delicious, and my <mark>Chicken Tortilla Soup</mark> and <mark>Pepperoni Pizza</mark> were wolfed down in a shameful display almost as noticeable as my preference for hopping around the beer menu: big sky moose drool can totally give way to kronenbourg 1664 if you try.\n\nand through it all tasha managed the suffocating requests of her demanding table, a performance that would go unnoticed if you were not paying attention given that everyone working here is a study in quick service and attentiveness. food runners actually running food? hostesses navigating the dining room with purpose? bartenders keeping their orders flowing? you'd better believe it. we did not see a manager but i am assuming one was on duty, probably sitting in the rafters like batman/woman, waiting to pounce when the need makes itself known.\n\nthere was one last bit of unfinished business: dessert. i'll just say this now: order the s'more brownie item. it will change your life. as the owner and operator of a beard and mustache, it almost made me consider shaving them off due to me realizing hot marshmallow embedded into my hair is not the most glamorous feeling. but wow if that was not the best way to go into a sugar coma that i have had the pleasure of eating in quite a while.\n\nyes, yard house is a chain and yes, you know what you're getting by eating at one. but this one in particular has service and set up down to an art form. more tvs than you could ever watch? extensive seating? a prime location away from most of the touristy things? absolutely. and believe the hype, too - until the owners build one of these in dallas, tx (hint, hint), it will remain a \"must-go\" destination for any upcoming las vegas trips. who am i kidding? even after they build one in dallas, tx (nudge, nudge), i'll still be stopping here.",

            "a recent visit to celebrate a friend's birthday, yard house left me feeling disappointed.  we had a large party, about 14 people at the table.  during our visit, we even had a shift change, where our original waitress was kind enough to let us know she was leaving and who was taking over.  \n\nalthough the rest of our table had appetizers, the husband and i arrived in time for entrees:\n\n* new york steak salad \"green beans, roasted peppers, avocado, <mark>Crispy Brussels Sprouts & Ripped Potatoes</mark>, red onion and baby lettuce tossed in a gorgonzola vinaigrette with beefsteak tomatoes and pickled egg\" ($16.95) - a generous and flavorful salad, loaded with the ingredients listed and a tasty steak.\n\n* <mark>Cuban Roast Pork Dip</mark> \"tomatoes, <mark>Pepper Jack</mark> cheese, pickles, dijon and garlic aioli on french bread grilled with bbq au jus\" ($12.65) - this was the husband's order and i had a bite.  it wasn't that great, especially when i recall my previous experience with a cuban sandwich.  the fries were good though.\n\nmy concern was more with service.  the waiter asked the birthday girl what kind of dessert she wanted (out of three choices), and she went for the chocolate souffle cake \"mini serving with vanilla ice cream, served warm\".  when it arrived, there was no candle which surprised us all.  (how are you supposed to sing happy birthday without a candle to blow?)  and he only gave us one spoon, which reminded me that he never brought back dessert menus for the rest of us.  at this point, we didn't bother ordering dessert since the birthday girl already had hers.  that part made the experience disappointing.\n\nthe other waiter was able to do a split tender on the check, which was helpful.  (although he put the costs wrong on my receipt, oh well.)  i usually think yard house is on top of things, but i guess they weren't that night.", 
            "work nearby and am here often as part of the weekday lunch crowd.  the menu has enough variety, that it can satisfy a group of varying tastes, and they have a great lunch menu, with smaller versions of their regular menu items--  soups, salads, sandwiches and pastas---  all of which are above-par, especially for a chain restaurant.\n\nprops to the <mark>Cuban Roast Pork Dip</mark>, or if you want to eat a little lighter--  go with the thai noodle or <mark>Ahi Crunchy </mark> salad.", 
            "i've been to yard house quite a few times. i often frequent this place with friends or bring out of town guests here because the menu is extensive and there is something on it for just about everyone. plus the beer selection, as well as the wine, and mixed drinks have the ability to please every palate. \n\nrecently i brought my sister and brother-in-law here based off of those facts. three people with probably rather different tastes is kind of a hard combo to deal with when choosing a dining spot. luckily, yard house did the trick. \n\nthere was a wait when we arrived, but it was only about 10 minutes and we were seated in a large, comfy booth, although next to the kitchen and a bit noisy, it was okay as we could all still carry on a conversation without yelling to be heard. \n\nthe run down of the food went as following -\n\n<mark>Grilled Artichoke</mark> appetizer - delicious! the artichoke was grilled perfectly and served with a garlic dipping sauce. we ate every bite and then tried to eat more. baked potato chips were also served with it, the perfect appetizer.\n\n<mark>Pan Seared Ahi</mark> <mark>New York Steak Sandwich</mark> - okay, this was just about the best thing i've had to eat in a long time. the ahi was seared perfectly, somewhat cooked around the outside, and deliciously raw on the inside. the pairings in the sandwich were perfect- spinach, swiss cheese, tomato, and caramelized onions. it comes on a rye bread and with shoe-string french fries. honestly, this sandwich is worth every penny. \n\n<mark>Cuban Roast Pork Dip</mark> - my sister ordered this sandwich and it looked very good. it came with a bbq au jus and shoe-string french fries. \n\nhouse salad & <mark><mark><mark>Clam Chowder</mark></mark></mark> - my brother-in-law opted for this. the soup came out piping hot and he said it was really good. my sister declared it to be good too. the house salad was big, much bigger than i was expecting, so kudos to yh on the portions. \n\noverall i have to give it up to yard house. this most recent visit was definitely a 5 star affair. everything was cooked well, service was good, the wait wasn't long, the noise level was decent, and  we were in and out with zero problems."

            "since we usually visit the location in the lbc we went here expecting good food, and that's exactally what we got! they actually exceeded my expectations. i had the best <mark>New York Steak Sandwich</mark> i've ever had in my life!  it was a little more cooked than i had asked for ( i ordered med-rare and i got medium toward the well side), but nevertheless delicious!  and the steak was so succulent and tender i really can't complain. my hubby had the <mark>Pan Seared Ahi</mark> sandwich, which was mouth watering delicious. \n\nthe service was good even if the waitress was a little bit too fake, but everyone in vegas is working on tips so i can't blame her. she did let my beer go empty one time though!  shame on her.\n\nunlike the location in long beach this one seems to be very family oriented, there were tons of people here eating with their children.  hardly anyone at the bar, go figure.\n\nwe'll definately come back next time we're in town.", 
            "came here today to take some unexpected friends out for some food. they were uber-hungover and needed some bad for you food. i had my monkeys in tow so it had to be some place loud. yard house was the answer. \n\nthe whole experience was wonderful starting from amy, the hostess (she was very bubbly and genuinely cared about how my day was going) to tracy, our server. she quickly brought out a mac n' cheese 2 for the kids (such a blessing to get quick food for little ones). we tried a bunch of different plates...like the ahi tuna <mark>Ahi Poke Bowl </mark>, <mark>Spicy Tuna Roll</mark>, <mark><mark>Deviled Eggs</mark></mark> (which i didn't have...wasn't feeling it today), <mark>Truffle Fries</mark>, a burger with no bun, a <mark>New York Steak Sandwich</mark> with <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> drizzled with some honey sauce that made me want to scream with delight. the monkeys downed the mac n cheese like it was their last meal and were blessedly quiet. \n\nwill be back again soon :)",

            "easily the best place to eat in ts without spending tons of money (ahem, texas de brazil). \n\nlove, love, love the food here! actually, i need to amend that. i've had the same entree every time i've gone to the yardhouse. every time. it's that good. the <mark>Pan Seared Ahi</mark> <mark>New York Steak Sandwich</mark>. the fish is always excellent quality and very fresh. onions caramelized to melt-in-my-mouth goodness. and the garlic aioli...i'd take a bath in it if i could. \n\nanyway, everyone else i've gone with says the other entrees are also delicious. the appetizers are pretty tasty, notably the <mark>Grilled Artichoke</mark>. the <mark>Onion Ring Tower</mark> is also worth a try! the house brews are really good. can't say anything about dessert, as i've always been too full from dinner and beer to smash more food into my belly. \n\nthis is one of those places that gets very crowded, so be prepared for a wait. obviously, if you're flexible about where you sit, you sit faster. fyi: they keep the patio tables open during the winter, but they pull down canvas \"walls\" and crank up space heaters to keep the warm in and cold out, so don't immediately pass up the patio when it's chilly!\n\nthe service is nothing special, but is also not terrible. they also play sports on the tvs, if you're into that sort of thing ;)\n\nyardhouse is another staple!",

            "i've been to yard house quite a few times. i often frequent this place with friends or bring out of town guests here because the menu is extensive and there is something on it for just about everyone. plus the beer selection, as well as the wine, and mixed drinks have the ability to please every palate. \n\nrecently i brought my sister and brother-in-law here based off of those facts. three people with probably rather different tastes is kind of a hard combo to deal with when choosing a dining spot. luckily, yard house did the trick. \n\nthere was a wait when we arrived, but it was only about 10 minutes and we were seated in a large, comfy booth, although next to the kitchen and a bit noisy, it was okay as we could all still carry on a conversation without yelling to be heard. \n\nthe run down of the food went as following -\n\n<mark>Grilled Artichoke</mark> appetizer - delicious! the artichoke was grilled perfectly and served with a garlic dipping sauce. we ate every bite and then tried to eat more. baked potato chips were also served with it, the perfect appetizer.\n\n<mark>Pan Seared Ahi</mark> <mark>New York Steak Sandwich</mark> - okay, this was just about the best thing i've had to eat in a long time. the ahi was seared perfectly, somewhat cooked around the outside, and deliciously raw on the inside. the pairings in the sandwich were perfect- spinach, swiss cheese, tomato, and caramelized onions. it comes on a rye bread and with shoe-string french fries. honestly, this sandwich is worth every penny. \n\n<mark>Cuban Roast Pork Dip</mark> - my sister ordered this sandwich and it looked very good. it came with a bbq au jus and shoe-string french fries. \n\nhouse salad & <mark><mark><mark>Clam Chowder</mark></mark></mark> - my brother-in-law opted for this. the soup came out piping hot and he said it was really good. my sister declared it to be good too. the house salad was big, much bigger than i was expecting, so kudos to yh on the portions. \n\noverall i have to give it up to yard house. this most recent visit was definitely a 5 star affair. everything was cooked well, service was good, the wait wasn't long, the noise level was decent, and  we were in and out with zero problems.", 
            "over 700 other reviews, what can i say? we came we saw, we ate. massive menu. great, knowledgable staff. didn't care to see 5 or 6 servers all surrounding one computer terminal chatting, but ah well. \n\nmy wife enjoyed a southerwestern salad, while i ate an ahi <mark>New York Steak Sandwich</mark> for the first time. nothing wrong with the meals. service was fine too. i don't know what it is but the \"it factor\" is missing to would warrent a five star rating. don't get me wrong the place is fine and recommendable. other than trying something different on the menu, i don't really see a reason to return... yet."

            "pros:\n* delicious food. you have to try the <mark><mark>Gardein Blackened Chicken Torta</mark></mark> soup.\n* friendly staff.\n* modern menu and decor.\n\ncons:\n* expensive. the food while good is slightly too expensive.\n* due to the popularity, they're generally crowded with long waits.\n\ni believe town square to be the best shopping and restaurant plaza in las vegas. the quantity of choices for either is only matched by the quality. there certainly is no shortage of great food at town square and on yelp, yard house is rated best of them all. i haven't tried them all but i can definitely say yard house is the best i've had yet.\n\ni went with a group of four on a late tuesday afternoon. they weren't busy or crowded but i have seen the line pour out the door enough times to know i was lucky. we were promptly sat down just time to enjoy the happy hour menu. we ordered their famous tower of onion rings while we sifted through the massive menu. i ordered the <mark>Gardein Bbq Chicken Salad</mark> with a cup of <mark>Grilled Cheese & <mark><mark><mark>Organic Tomato Bisque</mark></mark></mark></mark> soup. the other members of my party ordered the barbeque <mark>Gardein Bbq Chicken Salad</mark> with a cup of <mark><mark>Gardein Blackened Chicken Torta</mark></mark> soup, pastrami sandwich, and a mushroom burger. \n\nwhen the <mark>Onion Ring Tower</mark> arrived it instantly lived up to the expectations. thin, lightly battered, crispy onion rings sprinkled with parmesan cheese and served with ranch and chipotle ranch. they bursted with flavor to die for. at first the tower seems so incredibly large but when you finish the memory feels small in hindsight. my soup and salad was good with a pleasant, creamy, rich ranch dressing and well-seasoned <mark>Grilled Cheese & <mark><mark><mark>Organic Tomato Bisque</mark></mark></mark></mark> soup. however, it paled in comparison to the nothing short of perfect, <mark><mark>Gardein Blackened Chicken Torta</mark></mark> soup. i have never had a <mark>Chicken Tortilla Soup</mark> so creamy and flavorful. they put a large piece of avocado in the cup along with the crispy tortilla strips and large chunks of chicken. together, they blend to create a truly wonderful and hearty cup of soup. i had a bite of the barbeque <mark>Gardein Bbq Chicken Salad</mark> and while it was a bit too saucy for my tastes, the barbeque dressing wasn't overpowering and went well with the large pile of onion strings atop the salad. the pastrami sandwich looked great and the burger looked even better. the burger bun instantly caught my eye with a smooth crisp surface devoid of any grease or sheen. next time i will surely try a burger. \n\nthe town square location is large and wide open. the lighting is dim and creates a hip vibe that went well with the modern menu. everyone in my group had a few questions about the menu and the server was friendly, knowledgeable, and willing to help. the prices however are a bit steep and you might want to arrive early to take advantage of the happy hour choices. one specific item that caught my eye was the 17 dollar macaroni and cheese. it looked delicious but it would have to be at that price.\n\nin the end i walked away satisfied and yearning to return to try a burger or maybe even that posh mac and cheese entree.", 
            "no matter what i order here it is always always delicious! they have the best <mark><mark>Gardein Blackened Chicken Torta</mark></mark> soup!!! i also love their pineapple cider, so refreshing! it's expensive so i only come here in special occasions!", 
            "great lunch today so nice that they do lunch specials on the weekend.  great variety on the menu.  love the <mark><mark>Gardein Blackened Chicken Torta</mark></mark> soup i had today for the first time.  always have had great fast friendly service", 
            "love the food and drinks at this location. been here multiple times and always had excellent service. the <mark><mark>Gardein Blackened Chicken Torta</mark></mark> soup is fantastic and so is the mac n cheese. the happy hour prices are great. i also appreciate that they do separate checks, even for large parties.",

            "this is one of the new millions of beers on tap concept restaurants. the food was great, the staff friendly and professional and the atmosphere smart casual. i had the shrimp cobb salad that was fresh and tasty, and i appreciated the availability of a half portion so i could try the soup. the <mark><mark>Gardein Blackened Chicken Torta</mark></mark> soup, is a must try. this is a good solid classy bar with something for everyone."

            "after and independent of a uye, when i join my yelp friends for socializing at the yard house, it becomes the yelp house. the yard house is a fun place for groups of friends to hang out over beer and good food. the restaurant does a commendable job accommodating large groups. both times that i went to the yard house we had no problem getting a large table. the service is precise. and when it is time to pay, we had our own checks. substitute yelpers for a gathering of general friends, or a date and the yard house is everybody's social house.\n\n  the yard house is my choice chain restaurant for beer selection. the yard house is to beer what baskin robbins is to ice cream. whereas baskin robbins features 31 flavors of ice cream,, the yard house features approximately 600 flavors of beer (i counted the beer listed in the menu). if i were to go to the yard house one friday a week to order a flavor of beer, according to my math it would take me 12 years to done this. or if i were to go to the yard house everyday to try a flavor of beer, it would take me 2 years to do this. some of the beers may have been listed under a couple of different headings. the deal is that the yard house selection of beer is as good as it gets. \n\n  there are eleven series of beer. there is the chalkboard series. the cider series is the seasonals. the light beer is less than 5.8% alcohol content. this series includes many of the name brands such as michelob and budweiser. there is the honey fruit series which includes bbc strawberry blonde and blue point blueberry. there is the wheat series that includes blue hawaiin hefeweizen. the malty series includes bass ale and alaskin amber. the dark series includes big sky moose drool and bison organic chocolate. the bitter series includes anchor liberty and blue point hoptical illusion. and there is the strong and effervescent series. the menu lists the alcohol content. unless i overlooked something, the allagash curieux is the strongest at 11% alcohol content. there are three sizes of beer. i went for the middle size which is the pint. for the record i greatly appreciated the firestone.\n\n  this very yard house features a happy hour and late night specials. the happy hour is monday-friday 3-6 pm and late night special sunday-wednesday 10-close. they include domestic pints from $4.25-$5.75, well drinks $4.27-$4.75 and wine by glass $2 off. if you are up to food there are half price appetizers & pizza.\n\n  the food is good but i've tasted better. my complaint about the <mark><mark>Roasted Turkey Club</mark></mark> is that it was layers of sandwich instead of the sandwich i am accustomed to. the <mark>Classic Cheese</mark> was a good choice. the fries are these skinny things that remind me of potato sticks. i feel that the yard house ought to expand their fries selection to include steak fries and just thicker fries.\n\n  when i socialize at a restaurant, i am big on the music that is playing. i was won over by the music playing. i heard great music from led zeppelin, the rolling stones and classic rock era.\n\n  the yard house excells at their selection of beer. whether it is my yelp house or social house i intend to return. when i return i plan to try the blue point blueberry beer that is brewed in blue point, ny; 5 miles south of where i lived. gotta be patriotic to my home town.\n\ndaniel. s yelp 100 challenge. review 72", 
            "i won't lie. i had the lowest expectations of yard house after having been to so many lackluster ones. luckily for vegas, this one is a winner, winner. now all i'm missing is a chicken dinner.\n\nbut there's a lot more to be had. like all yard house menus, the variety spans from americana to asian in one giant menu. it's like cheesecake factory, but pricier and vastly higher quality. if there is a place to enjoy a killer selection of beer, while ordering everything from hawaiian poke to korean kalbi to <mark>Shrimp Ceviche </mark>, let it be here.\n\nas a venue, this yard house is stacked. a robust wait staff, plenty of seating all around, with tvs lining the ceilings and corners and game audio for a crowded monday night football viewing. who ever said this side of vegas (town square) was boring? certainly not i.\n\nmy hungry and tired of group of frenzy eaters ordered a plethora of random stuff, just as their menu intended:\n\nchicken <mark>Lettuce Wraps</mark> ($12)\n<mark>Kung Pao Calamari</mark> ($11)\nseared <mark>Ahi Sashimi </mark> ($14)\nboneless wings ($13)\nhawaiian <mark>Poke Stack</mark> ($14)\n<mark><mark>Roasted Turkey Club</mark></mark> ($11)\n<mark>Spicy Tuna Roll</mark> ($13)\n\nall in all, everything was decent. the chicken <mark>Lettuce Wraps</mark> were fresh, tasty, and abundant. wasn't the biggest fan of the <mark>Kung Pao Calamari</mark>, but folks looking for a different take on fried squid ought to try it once. while the <mark><mark>Roasted Turkey Club</mark></mark>, boneless wings, and <mark>Spicy Tuna Roll</mark> (which looked like mofongo!) were somewhere in the middle, the <mark>Pan Seared Ahi</mark> and <mark>Poke Stack</mark> were the surprising winners of the night. extra surprising that it tasted like fresh fish all while in the middle of the desert? most definitely.\n\nwhile i'm not one to frequent chains, i can see myself coming back to this yard house with beer loving, sports seeking, hungry, good company. lastly, it's a solid spot that is  within 2 minutes away from mccarran international airport."

            "my first time at the yard house wasn't really anything special, but i can see why people would like it. the ambiance is cozy for sports enthusiasts and beer connoissers.  they have about 150 different beers on tap which is impressive. i sat at the bar and had one of the beers on tap. after looking thru their extensive beer menu, i ordered the sin city light; it was good. it's about $6 for a beer. so for the most part, the bar is what makes the place; along with all the flat screen tvs mounted throughout.\n\nas a restaurant...they need a lot of work. i ordered the <mark><mark>Roast Beef Dip</mark></mark>. a simple dish (it's a sandwich for crying out loud), how can anyone get that wrong...au jus was too salty. that's what makes the sandwich! also, they need to melt the provolone in the sandwich. they just slapped on a cold piece of cheese! one of my friends had the porter house steak. she had ordered it medium, but she realized as she was cutting into the steak that it was a little on the rare side. once she pointed that out to our non-attentive waiter, he did take the steak back and correct it. the manager even brought it back out to her and apologized for that and did not charge for her entree. that was nice of him... my cousin had the <mark>Lettuce Wraps</mark>. i didn't try them, but he says that the wraps were really good. my brother had the ahi salad. he liked it. the prices on their food menu are comparable to that of a chilis or chevy's.\n\nnow about our waiter...seems like he was trying to avoid us the whole time we were there. the sad thing is that he was also training someone on the floor that night; what a good example he is setting for the trainee! we had to wave him down a couple of times for drinks and a couple times for condiments. come to think of it, we didn't even get place settings until after our food arrived. we had to ask another waiter for that! he only came by to check on us once, and that was the same time he slapped us the bill.",

            "this place redefines what to expect for bar food. the first time my boss suggested this spot for a work lunch i was disappointed. vegas has so many great options. why would i want to eat bar food? i was wrong because the food is good, not just average bar food.\n\nthe lunch specials are very tasty and accommodate a lunch hour at a reasonable price. my favorite combination is the 1/2 <mark><mark>Roast Beef Dip</mark></mark> with a salad. diet splurge meets healthy. my favorite appetizers are the onion rings and <mark>Chicken Nachos</mark>. when we come here for work dinners the mac & cheese with truffle oil is a favorite for several of my coworkers. the burgers are also really good, loaded with toppings and very juicy.\n\nthe menu is huge and has something to accommodate all tastes. great spot to take a picky friend. this is obviously a great spot for beer lovers since they have so many beers on tap.\n\nthis particular location has a lot of outdoor seating which is a great option on a nice day. the patio is in the center of the shopping center for plenty of people watching entertainment."

            "this was our first time at yard house and maybe my expectations were higher than they should've been.  the place reminded me a lot of bj's restaurant, although this place had more of a different twist to their menu.  they also serve a ton of beer!  the display of all of the beer kegs right when you enter is quite impressive!  since i'm not much of a beer drinker, i opted for the fruitier belgian drink called the lindeman's framboise.  it's seriously an alcoholic juice...very dangerous!  \n\nas for food, i think our eyes were hungrier than our stomachs!  we ordered the <mark>Truffle Fries</mark> (shredded parmesan and herbs) with a hint of garlic.  it was delish!  then we ordered the <mark>Ahi Poke Bowl </mark> with some fried wontons that were also quite tasty.  then we ordered pastrami sliders which did not meet my standards.  i have had better <mark>Pastrami Benedict Burger</mark> and this one was on the salty side.  the hubby also ordered <mark>Moo Shu Egg Rolls</mark> (no good) and chinese <mark>Chicken <mark>Shiitake <mark>Lobster Garlic Noodles</mark></mark></mark>.  maybe i was delusional to think that the <mark>Chicken <mark>Shiitake <mark>Lobster Garlic Noodles</mark></mark></mark> would come close to thanh long's.  \n\nall in all, if you want lots of beer variety and a good atmosphere, then this place is for you.  just don't expect them to excel in the food department.",

            "the first time coming here, i was pretty impressed that they had a vegetarian menu. that was already a plus for me. i came here with family that had come into town and almost all of us ordered vegetarian. we had hummus and pita, <mark>Truffle Fries</mark>, <mark><mark>Deviled Eggs</mark></mark>,the gardein <mark><mark>Gardein Orange Peel Chicken</mark></mark>, the gardein <mark>Penne with Chicken</mark>, and  hongos y rajas tacos. they were all really good. i was impressed. many places that offer vegetarian dishes mess them up by adding too much of something, whether it's tofu or vegetables. in this case, the gardein products were utilized perfectly. for dessert, we had a mini creme brulee, a mini peach apple <mark>Cobb</mark>, and a mini lemon souffle. this entire meal was demolished by my family. the only reason i gave it 4 stars is because i ordered root beer thinking that a place that makes their own beer would make their own homeade root beer and cream soda. sadly, they only had barq's root beer. what a disappointment! i will definitely come back and enjoy more selections next time.\n\n\nthat was my last review.\n\nhere's an update. last time i went to yardhouse, i ordered vegetarian jerk wings. they were pretty good until i realized the wings were definitely not vegetarian. that is a mistake a restaurant should never make. luckily, i'm not a customer who likes to cause problems since i work in the industry but i was shocked that happened. for that, i demoted yardhouse.",

            "came here today to take some unexpected friends out for some food. they were uber-hungover and needed some bad for you food. i had my monkeys in tow so it had to be some place loud. yard house was the answer. \n\nthe whole experience was wonderful starting from amy, the hostess (she was very bubbly and genuinely cared about how my day was going) to tracy, our server. she quickly brought out a mac n' cheese 2 for the kids (such a blessing to get quick food for little ones). we tried a bunch of different plates...like the ahi tuna <mark>Ahi Poke Bowl </mark>, <mark>Spicy Tuna Roll</mark>, <mark><mark>Deviled Eggs</mark></mark> (which i didn't have...wasn't feeling it today), <mark>Truffle Fries</mark>, a burger with no bun, a <mark>New York Steak Sandwich</mark> with <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> drizzled with some honey sauce that made me want to scream with delight. the monkeys downed the mac n cheese like it was their last meal and were blessedly quiet. \n\nwill be back again soon :)", 
            "the first time coming here, i was pretty impressed that they had a vegetarian menu. that was already a plus for me. i came here with family that had come into town and almost all of us ordered vegetarian. we had hummus and pita, <mark>Truffle Fries</mark>, <mark><mark>Deviled Eggs</mark></mark>,the gardein <mark><mark>Gardein Orange Peel Chicken</mark></mark>, the gardein <mark>Penne with Chicken</mark>, and  hongos y rajas tacos. they were all really good. i was impressed. many places that offer vegetarian dishes mess them up by adding too much of something, whether it's tofu or vegetables. in this case, the gardein products were utilized perfectly. for dessert, we had a mini creme brulee, a mini peach apple <mark>Cobb</mark>, and a mini lemon souffle. this entire meal was demolished by my family. the only reason i gave it 4 stars is because i ordered root beer thinking that a place that makes their own beer would make their own homeade root beer and cream soda. sadly, they only had barq's root beer. what a disappointment! i will definitely come back and enjoy more selections next time.\n\n\nthat was my last review.\n\nhere's an update. last time i went to yardhouse, i ordered vegetarian jerk wings. they were pretty good until i realized the wings were definitely not vegetarian. that is a mistake a restaurant should never make. luckily, i'm not a customer who likes to cause problems since i work in the industry but i was shocked that happened. for that, i demoted yardhouse.", 
            "delish! quite the selection of beers. their was even two choices of framboise so i was very excited about that! ordered appetizers, <mark><mark>Deviled Eggs</mark></mark> and <mark>Truffle Fries</mark>...mmm mmm good! they put this sweet salsa like sauce on top of the eggs to give it that extra umph. they only give you 3 halves so we were wondering where that 4th half goes off to ;-) the <mark>Truffle Fries</mark> were seasoned with herbs and garlic making it the high light of our apps. pretty dang delicious! the service wasn't all that great but they were very busy and our server did check in with us periodically when she could. i just love coming to yard house. the atmosphere is something different than what anyone else can offer.  \n\nthe restrooms were very well maintained as well as the establishment itself. a+ for effort!", 
            "great beer selection,over 100 taps, some nice ipa's.  food was pretty solid, tried the <mark><mark>Deviled Eggs</mark></mark> with tomato sauce, pear and gorgonzola flatbread, and a fish taco.  town square is a great location away from the casinos.", 
            "the yardhouse is a nice place to go if you're tired of the same old brews on tap. they have a fantastic and interesting selection of beers available, even if their staff sometimes can't offer much help! in their defense, though, the beer list is quite lengthy.\n\nthis particular location has a pretty nice patio with a fire pit outside that makes for some great people watching. i find that every yardhouse i've been to is always incredibly loud. maybe it's the cement floors that just ricochet the sound throughout the restaurant, but it makes for the main reason i stay away from these restaurants until a friend drags me along for happy hour.\n\nthe food is decent and i'll give them props for having a wide variety of tastes that goes well beyond your typical bar food. unfortunately, everything is only decent. people rave about the <mark>Truffle Fries</mark>, but for me personally, i've never been into the white truffle oil thing and think it tastes like gasoline - fresh truffles are another matter entirely. \nthe ahi tuna <mark>Ahi Poke Bowl </mark> is fresh and my favorite thing to order here- light soy sauce, rich avocado, a little bit of crunch and sesame oil.. great success. \nthe ahi tuna burgers on the other hand- which claim to be fresh ahi tuna that is hand chopped - automatically comes cooked well. who.. in their right mind.. cooks fresh ahi tuna well?! it's madness i tell you, and made those burgers that were once great, completely below par. if you decide to go this route - make sure you specify how you want them done!\nthe <mark><mark>Deviled Eggs</mark></mark> were a little sweet, but definitely a fun and unusual choice for a restaurant.\nahi tuna caesar salad- exactly what you'd expect.\n<mark><mark>French Onion</mark> Soup</mark> - decent, but nothing to rave about. a small bowl with provolone melted over the top, a little lighter broth than most places, the bread was okay. just okay.\n\noverall, a good happy hour with something for everyone - even a fire pit!", 
            "ate here for dinner. great service and ambiance. the ahi tuna burger was kind of dry though. <mark><mark>Deviled Eggs</mark></mark> were great. lots of selections for everyone.", 
            "i have been the yard house many times and there are very few things i don't like.  the spinach <mark>Lobster, Crab & Artichoke Dip</mark> wasn't the best but i really like their pizza's and <mark><mark>Deviled Eggs</mark></mark>.  the service is always great too!"

            "woah..so good! this place is huge, the wait isn't bad, the prices are good, and the menu is spectacular! great for small and larger groups alike!\n\ni went to lv for the first time last weekend and some local friends took a few of us non-local folks out for dinner saturday night and boy did they pick a great place! we had a group of 6 and the wait wasn't bad for a busy/packed restaurant. they said it was their favorite spot and i'm sure glad we went off the strip to grab a bite to eat because they were right, this place really is great!\n\ntheir beer selection is huge, the food all sounds great and i definitely had a hard time trying to narrow down what i wanted. if only my tummy could consume as much food as my eyes could! we got several rounds of drinks, some appetizers (the <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> with sauce are soooo tasty!), and then i chose the crusted parmesan chicken with sun-dried tomato and mushroom sauce. i don't really even like mushrooms but i was a member of the clean plate club here! my husband got some <mark>Chicken <mark>Shiitake <mark>Lobster Garlic Noodles</mark></mark></mark> and they were amazing! mmmmm!\n\nthe server was super friendly, helpful, quick, and fun! we watched some games on tv's, laughed for a while, and had a great time. i wish that my hometown had this restaurant! the prices are great, the food presentation and quantity is awesome, and i would highly recommend checking this place out. \n\ncheers!", 
            "okay, there are a few things that are going to be brought up and i'm almost guaranteed to get a manager comment on this, but whatever, it's happening.\n\nwent here last night to try the gardein line here. i was very excited to see that vegan meats have been added to some of their dishes. how cool is that?? but upon doing some internet research before we ordered, i found out that due to cooking methods, all of the dishes wouldn't be vegan or vegetarian. they cook everything on the same grill as the meat. what sense does this make? none. it's like having a black coat and putting bleach all over it - it doesn't resemble a black coat anymore and is tainted. if you mix vegan food with meat, what is the point? \n\nand here comes why it is 2-star. it is not standard procedure for the veg*n menu to be cooked in a separate pan. you have to go out of your way to ask for this, and even then a manager comes out to explain that it's not going to taste the same as if it were on the grill. hmm - do you really think a vegan wants dead cow mixed in with her food? hell no. granted, yardhouse has already taken *some* action and put a little dot next to a few items that absolutely will come in contact with meat since these items are fried and have to go in the same basket as everything else. but they haven't specified that all the menu items will come in contact with animal products which is not okay. it would be really helpful if people who come here know this right off the bat. if i hadn't had my phone on me that night, i literally would have gotten sick since i haven't had any sort of meat in 6 years. \n\nhere's what i would suggest: just like other companies before you (chipotle comes to mind), please automatically make all the vegetarian/gardein items cooked separately from the meat. you don't want a lawsuit a la mcdonald's. it is ridiculous that these vegan meats come to you and then you cross-contaminate them with animal sources to make them not even vegetarian. oh and this isn't just for this yardhouse, it goes for all of them - trust me, i will be contacting your corporate offices today. also, it would be nice if you could put a little v next to the items that could be made vegan or are vegan on the menu. makes ordering easier, and the confusion of your staff minimal.\n\nanyways, i ordered the veggie sliders that come with fries, and we also ordered a side of <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>. matt ordered a thai \"chicken\" pizza. after some back and forth, the sliders couldn't even go on the bread (only the wheat bread is vegan) so i got them protein style, wrapped in lettuce. the <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> we got as our appetizer were severely lackluster. very bland, no taste, no toppings like sugar or anything. we couldn't have the sauce since it contained bacon, so i guess that's where all the flavor is. after the aforementioned back and forth with the wait staff, we got our food. do they seriously only have the meat and the bun (in my case, lettuce) for the sliders? nothing else? no tomato or onion or even ketchup and mustard? for serious? the taste of the gardein patty was wonderful, but for almost $11 for plain patties is ridiculous. the fries were way better than the sweet potato ones, but it just wasn't worth the price. i wish they would have suggested to make my order a veggie burger since that's essentially what they did anyways, was cut the patty into four pieces and pass them off as sliders. at least then i could have had the wheat bun and toppings. \n\nit was very difficult throughout the night to try and signal our waitress. i know it was very busy and that i did ask a lot of questions and such, but she was an expert ninja. not the best customer service in the world. i also unfortunately don't see this gardein line lasting here at yardhouse. until cooking the items separately becomes standard procedure, i can see a lot of vexed veg*ns. honestly, what is the point of having vegan meats if they're going to end up on the same grill as actual meats? i just don't get that logic. yardhouse itself is a bit pricey and i understand this, but at least give the customer the most you can. plain sliders are not okay. in fact, i don't think i've been anywhere that has completely bare sliders. \n\ndue to the lackluster food, the outrageous price tag and the lack of good customer service, yardhouse really deserves a 1-star review but i still love that a chain has decided to put vegan faux meats on their menu. the intent is there, but the execution is awful but can be easily improved upon. i might be back since there were other items that looked appetizing, but only when i want to deal with the headaches and the hassle. until then, i'll stock up on gardein at whole foods and make my own delights at home.", 
            "lets preface how i even ended up here: \n\ni was having a bad week (i got sick with a stomach virus, sick boyfriend, dog got sick from ingesting cat litter pellets, water heater broke, fought with my mom on her birthday call, neighbors stole my trashcans, my iphone broke) so the yelperazzi got together to try to turn things around. it's a real yelp success story....we came as strangers and discovered friends. i mean i adore a lot of people on yelp, but i'm particularly lucky to have met jieun l, anthony m., elnino f, and andy t who cared \nenough to get me out of the house and get me out of my birthday funk.  my bf reads my reviews and he also turned everything around with the small things. thank you guys and i love you all. \n\nbeers are here so i have a hard time not liking this chain...with the circumstance above though i was in that kind of mood to almost hate everything because i'm reserved to being \"done with\" today. it's extra kudos to the yardhouse reliable brews, decent food and our server that i still enjoyed the restaurant. yeah there are setbacks like any spots but drink selections make me happy so it was a good choice to turn around any bad day. our server (mitch) was pretty good in service, had good beer recommendations and he also brought me a happy birthday brownie sundae (yay!). nachos were pretty good and loaded with stuff. <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> maple bacon sauce was delish that i want to pour that on just about every breakfast item. ceviche spoons were fresh and light. <mark>Chicken <mark>Shiitake <mark>Lobster Garlic Noodles</mark></mark></mark>- good but go for the plain <mark>Chicken <mark>Shiitake <mark>Lobster Garlic Noodles</mark></mark></mark>. there was chicken, tofu, mushrooms, edamame, asparagus, chives, garlic, cheese and it's too much at once. simple is better with <mark>Chicken <mark>Shiitake <mark>Lobster Garlic Noodles</mark></mark></mark>.\n\nbf found a favorite beer worth mentioning- rogue dry hopped red. smooth with a bit of hops...a good choice to baby step into the ipas and dipas. he liked it much so that we went back 4days later to order this beer again...we never order twice since our goal is to drink down the whole list (past halfway). \n\na few drinks and plates in we were laughing so hard that i was snorting. i mean, i like never do that unless i'm really fighting hard to stop laughing. anthony has awesome one liners. jieun makes funny beer faces. elnino is a violent funny drunk. my bf coined some t-shirt worthy terms at the table. andy is just a g and always for a good time. \n\ni expected to go home from work, eat lunch and stay home alone until my bf can get off, head to dinner and go sleep and forget about the day even being my birthday. \n\neverything is alright when you have good company to make you smile.", 
            "i love this place! and once i heard they were opening one up in my neck of the woods (nor-cal), i jumped up and down with pitter pattering joy! \n\ntheir happy hour is well worth it. half off most of the appetizers. don't miss this one peeps!\n\nthe food is somewhat more than the average price but well worth it. about 15 dollars on average for an entree. \n\nour order: \n<mark>Coconut Shrimp</mark>: about 13 dollars for 4 large shrrrammmppss. yummy coconut crunchy goodness. 13 dollars worth? eh. i would have liked it a bit cheaper.\n<mark>Chicken <mark>Shiitake <mark>Lobster Garlic Noodles</mark></mark></mark>: not your average <mark>Chicken <mark>Shiitake <mark>Lobster Garlic Noodles</mark></mark></mark>. it was more buttery than garlicy. it's not what you taste in most chinese restaurants.\nsliders with <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>: decent. to me, they were just a bit average. but nonetheless, good.\n\nit's a bit dark inside. sets the mood. :op\n\nyardhouse, i like you. yes, i truly do.",

            "this is an ok place in my eyes, wouldn't probably wanna go back unless its for the beer. the night itself was amazing because we were there with good friends and it was really fun. the restaurant itself didn't impress me so much and the food didn't exactly take me to an amazing culinary journey. \n\nfirst of all, i was really impressed by their beer selection. my husband and i shared a hefeweissen dunkel und it tasted really smooth and good. the service was relatively fast for how crowded the place was. they were trying really hard i thought. still it took 15 minutes for our waters to come out.\n\ni guess i'm a little bit of a health freak and when i eat things i think about all the good things and bad things of the food for my body. i mean everything did have good flavors and was spiced pretty good, but i couldn't enjoy it so much and left the restaurant thinking 1. am i going to fit through the door? 2. omg i'm going to get a hearattache... \n\nthe <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> were very very greasy and there was almost oil dripping from my fingers as i was eating my sandwich. also, the food was kind of expensive i thought. the entrees were 10 dollars and up and didn't come with a side. they charge extra for the sides.", 
            "i have recently gone vegetarian and i find some sort of irony that this new diet is what has brought me to yardhouse in vegas for the first time. i have been to yardhouse before in a few other cities, but had a friend tell me last week about their vegetarian menu.\n\nthey use a meat substitute called gardein and it can be used in any of their dishes but they even have a section of the menu devoted to all of their vegetarian dishes. i decided to choose the chicken & veggie bowl with jasmine rice.. i expected it to be like a teriyaki sauce, but i have to admit that was my own assumption... in spite of not being sweet like i expected, it was a very delicious meal that i thoroughly enjoyed. my friend ordered the veggie <mark><mark>Gardein Fried Chicken Strips</mark></mark> with a side of <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>. of course i had to try this and i have to admit i would have loved to have ordered those too...\n\ni think this is going to be another one of my new spots to frequent as it can totally fit into my diet and keep others around me happy too...\n\nyay!!!\n\nps: can someone tell me why this isn't classified under vegetarian?? i would have found it a lot sooner...", 
            "i've been to town square many of times but never stepped foot inside of yard house til now. the resturaunt was huge and the staff was very friendly and welcoming. smiles and good times was all over the building, not only from the staff but also the customers.\n\nthe food was amazing and if you're a beer lover such as myself they have over 100 brews to choose from. the selection included everything from lagers to ale's and even mixed beer drinks if you want to mix raspberry lindermans framboise w/ a chocolate flavored beer. and worse case scenario, let's say that you can't make up your mind on a beer selection; they also have samples of every brew to find the perfect one for your taste buds... i prefer peroni.\n\nthe dinner was delicious. my girlfriend ordered a <mark>Spicy Thai Chicken</mark> flatbread sandwich with parmesan & herb fries. i had to take a bite lol, and that was bomb.com! chicken was grilled to perfection with avacado, cabbage, and spicy mustard. i ordered the <mark>BBQ Bacon Cheddar</mark> burger! heaven on earth. 1/2 lb sirloin cooked to order, melted cheddar cheese, smoked applewood bacon on a sweet hawaiian bun and <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> on the side. best burger i've ever had hands down.\n\nthe only downer i seen about the place is that its extremely loud inside of yard house. i'm not knocking anyone's fun but it was hard to carry a convo with my girlfriend without shouting at eachother and we're sitting next to eachother in a booth. but there's also outside dining so that probably could've been more peaceful to enjoy a nice elegant dinner. definitely is the spot if you're having a nice date and get hungry :-)", 
            "i'm a big fan of yard house, it's one of those place you can go and you know you'll eat good food.\ni always seem to get the <mark>Miso Glazed Sea Bass</mark> or the <mark>Pepper Crusted Filet</mark>...both are delicious.\nwe were adventurous, and just wanted a small bite so we got the <mark>New York Steak Sandwich</mark>, it was so good...i just wish the steak was sliced on the roll after cooking to make eating easier. i wasn't fond of the <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>, they were missing something. i also tried the <mark><mark><mark>Clam Chowder</mark></mark></mark>, it was okay.\ndrinks are great, whether you get beer or cocktails.\nstaff is always good.", 
            "when i found out that this place was a chain i was even more impressed. this place has the largest amount of beers on tap i have ever seen. they even had a northern california belgian that i love called brother thelonius on tap, which i thought was unheard of.\n\ni had the tuna poke for an app, basically it was tuna tartare, came mixed with avocado, it was very good. i also ordered the surf and turf burger. the lobster/burger combo was fantastic, it may not be the best burger i've ever had in my life but i would say it gets an honorable mention. i ordered mine with <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> that came with a maple bacon sauce, can't go wrong there. i also had a bite of the <mark>Chicken <mark>Shiitake <mark>Lobster Garlic Noodles</mark></mark></mark>, it was also great.", 
            "i love yard house. there atmosphere, the snooty bartenders, the great food and delicious drinks.. what's not to love. \n\nthey have a bunch of vegetarian options here! it's amazing. veggie \"beef\" sliders.. \"chicken\" <mark>Chicken <mark>Shrimp <mark><mark>Gardein Orange Peel Chicken</mark> Rice Bowl</mark></mark></mark>.. spicy \"chicken\" sandwich.. (that's what i got.. mostly because i've always wanted to say \"can i get the <mark>Spicy Thai Chicken</mark> sandwich please?\" i've never been able to say that before!). its the gardein substitute for meat, a gluten-free, soy-based protein that is supposed to duplicate the flavor/taste/texture of meat. i thought it was delish. moist and very filling. the aioli was great too. don't be afraid of the cabbage (i was, i hate cabbage). it's a thin layer, quite sparse and the other flavors conceal the cabbage anyway. i'm not sure if this is a nv thing or a new feature at the chain, bc the last one i went to in so cal didn't have that many veggie options (they had the regular amount, just not a half of a page in the menu dedicated to soy protein (fake meat) dishes!!\n\ni'd love to give them 5 stars, i really wanted to. the staff was friendly, they called when the order was ready (i picked up), they even had the water i requested all ready to go... but the <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> weren't cooked all the way through. not all of them, at least. as a giant fan of <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>, that is disappointing. it means enough to knock off a star even though yh knocked my socks off with the veggie menu. so stoked about that!", 
            "it's all about the <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> and onion rings here!  a good place to have dinner while watching a sporting event.  oh and they have a good selection on beers.", 
            "i've gone to this location a few times and it's a hit or miss really. definitely a great selection of beer, but the food is tricky. i went here with a friend and my boyfriend and we loved the sliders and the <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>. the few times i got burgers they were pretty good; no real complaints about the burgers. but i wanted to try something new (big mistake) so i decided to order the ahi tuna crispy salad (something along those lines). our server was great, which made not enjoying the food kind of a flop. \n\nwhen i received the salad, the tuna was sliced into maybe 1/4 inch pieces and the edges of each piece was covered in pepper. i do not like a whole bunch of pepper so that was a big disappointment for me. also, they saturated the salad in salad dressing. i had to send it back because it made it very difficult to each and extremely unappetizing. i tried to enjoy it after they fixed the drenching of the salad and put the dressing on the side, but it was still difficult to enjoy the food. i was highly considering asking them to change the salad into the sliders but i  didn't want to wait even longer to get my food because we waited a while to get my salad and my friend's burger. i was very disappointed and would not recommend getting that salad. i almost did not want to pay for the food because i felt that i did not enjoy the food and i wasted the tuna :(", 
            "this is my second time going to yard house. first time was in los angeles & second time in las vegas. i came here with my family (big party). we were readily seated outdoors. it wasn't hot (vegas weather) since there were mists to keep us cool. however, when they turned it off, the water kept dripping and splashing us.  we were irritated so we placed napkins on the area the water falls to prevent from splashing us. we informed our waiter about it and he said that it's been an ongoing problem and it's still in the process of being fixed.\n\ndj was our waiter for the night. he was very nice in the beginning. yard house is known for their beers on tap. i wanted to try something new. i asked dj for a recommendation. he served me 2 tasting beers. unfortunately, i only remember one of them, leffe blond. when i asked dj what it was again, he was unsure and couldn't remember the name. i was a little confused since he was the one who recommended the beers to me but yet he forgot the name of it.\n\nyard house is very pricey. luckily, we were there during happy hour. i ordered the pastrami sliders ($7) with <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>. the <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> were delicious! it took very long for the food the come out. once the food came out, the <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> were <mark>Specialty Hot Tea</mark> than the sliders. the sliders were very disappointing. i was expecting much from the sliders, but it only had pastrami and cheese. the sliders were also cold!\n\nmy sister also ordered dessert (souffl\\u00e9 & creme brulee) togo. everything was paid for already. dj never came back to check on us to see if we received the dessert order. instead, we had to ask one of the busboy to check on our to-go order. keep in mind we were waiting for 30 minutes already & we ordered the dessert before we were done eating. the busboy followed up and said that they were packing the dessert. after another 20 minutes, we finally received our order from another waiter & not dj. dj never came back after we gave him the money. \n\ni was very disappointed with the waiting time and the service from our waiter. it felt like our waiter didn't want anything but the payment & his tip. his service was not consistent.", 
            "management needs training....\ni ordered the mediterranean vegetable sand-which and a salad with lemon wedges on the side. i asked for the lemon three times before i gave up. then when my sand-which was served to me it was cold. i sent it back to the kitchen, the server than came over and made a joke about it. once the new one was brought over to me it was warmer but all that hot however the rest of my party was almost done dining so i choose to keep it.\ndebbie the manager on duty came over to check on me, which at first i thought was a wonderful touch. at which point she stated to me that the dish was grilled then kept cold and microwaved when ordered and served. i was shocked to hear this, all would have been acceptable with her apologizing but to further explain to me that the meal was microwaved was just beyond me.\nshe did not charge me for the meal but it was too late to save us. the food did not come out in order, one of the members of our party received her meal prior to her appetizer and another member did get the <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> that they ordered. \n\nwill not go back if i don't have too....", 
            "i love the beer selection at yardhouse and the food is fabulous too. i had the leinkugels sunset wheat, which i know sounds odd but truly tastes like fruity pebbles! it is just one of many on their huge list.\n\nthe <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> are a must try! it comes with a delicious maple aioli. we also had the <mark>Ahi Crunchy </mark> salad with the star obviously being the tuna. the dressing wasn't my favorite but overall the salad was still a success. the peppercorn gorgonzola is another favorite of mine!\n\nrebecca was our server last night and she was a sweetheart. she have great service, while still allowing her own personality to shine through. a great experience overall!", 
            "the service was great considering how busy it was hence the 1 star i give this place. the food was 0 stars. other than that, i would have given this place no stars. i ordered the <mark>Angel Hair Pasta</mark>, my bf ordered the dip with a side of <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> and our friend ordered a grilled chicken sandwhich with broccoli. when all of our orders came out, i tried the fries and they were cold. i mentioned it to my boyfriend and when he touched his sandwhich, it was also cold. i thought that was a bit weird, but when my friend took a bite if his sandwhich he said his chicken was also cold. i was thinking, maybe because it's a sandwhich, it wouldn't be that warm even though my bf ordered the <mark><mark>Roast Beef Dip</mark></mark>. so, i took a bite of my pasta and my pasta was dry, bland, and cold. it seemed like they left it out for a long time because the pasta was kind of stale. it was by far the worst meal i have eaten. no one in my party enjoyed their cold food. the food is over priced and they serve cold food. what i did notice yesterday night because i was sitting in front of the kitchen, was the food was coming out fast, but the food was standing there forever. i saw 4 dishes waiting there to be picked up for roughly 10 min. no wonder the food was getting cold! not enough runners to even bring the food out. horrible way to manage a business that can't have enough staff to bring out orders. i will never return here for the food. like a huge company like this, they should have already gotten their shit together. horrible."

            "i won't lie. i had the lowest expectations of yard house after having been to so many lackluster ones. luckily for vegas, this one is a winner, winner. now all i'm missing is a chicken dinner.\n\nbut there's a lot more to be had. like all yard house menus, the variety spans from americana to asian in one giant menu. it's like cheesecake factory, but pricier and vastly higher quality. if there is a place to enjoy a killer selection of beer, while ordering everything from hawaiian poke to korean kalbi to <mark>Shrimp Ceviche </mark>, let it be here.\n\nas a venue, this yard house is stacked. a robust wait staff, plenty of seating all around, with tvs lining the ceilings and corners and game audio for a crowded monday night football viewing. who ever said this side of vegas (town square) was boring? certainly not i.\n\nmy hungry and tired of group of frenzy eaters ordered a plethora of random stuff, just as their menu intended:\n\nchicken <mark>Lettuce Wraps</mark> ($12)\n<mark>Kung Pao Calamari</mark> ($11)\nseared <mark>Ahi Sashimi </mark> ($14)\nboneless wings ($13)\nhawaiian <mark>Poke Stack</mark> ($14)\n<mark><mark>Roasted Turkey Club</mark></mark> ($11)\n<mark>Spicy Tuna Roll</mark> ($13)\n\nall in all, everything was decent. the chicken <mark>Lettuce Wraps</mark> were fresh, tasty, and abundant. wasn't the biggest fan of the <mark>Kung Pao Calamari</mark>, but folks looking for a different take on fried squid ought to try it once. while the <mark><mark>Roasted Turkey Club</mark></mark>, boneless wings, and <mark>Spicy Tuna Roll</mark> (which looked like mofongo!) were somewhere in the middle, the <mark>Pan Seared Ahi</mark> and <mark>Poke Stack</mark> were the surprising winners of the night. extra surprising that it tasted like fresh fish all while in the middle of the desert? most definitely.\n\nwhile i'm not one to frequent chains, i can see myself coming back to this yard house with beer loving, sports seeking, hungry, good company. lastly, it's a solid spot that is  within 2 minutes away from mccarran international airport.", 
            "this review is strictly for the food as we did take out from this location.\n\n<mark>Shrimp Ceviche </mark> - 3.5 stars - normally full of shrimp and fruit, but this time the shrimp was lacking, so to me it was more of a fruit ceviche. still full of flavor and seasoned well, just lacking on the main ingredient.\n\nshrimp caesar salad - 4 stars - 4 jumbo shrimp cooked perfectly. nice and tender and full of flavor. perfect amount of cheese crisps and croutons, only lacking was the amount of dressing. \n\n<mark>Spinach Cheese Dip</mark> - 5 stars - always awesome and full of flavor. the chips work so well with the dip and the portion size is perfect.\n\n<mark>Angel Hair Pasta</mark> w/ shrimp - 5 stars - pasta cooked perfectly. sauce is on point and full of flavor. large amount of shrimp. portion size is perfect for sharing.\n\n<mark>Roasted Turkey Pot Pie</mark> 3.5 stars - first time having this dish here and was expecting a little more from the dish. the puff pastry was underdone, so it was greasy and not very edible. there were far too many leeks in the dish, so it tasted like turkey and onions which is not bad for me since i love onions, but it was just lacking in other flavors. on a positive note, there was a ton of turkey, so that was a huge positive.\n\nsalted caramel pudding - 5 stars - can never get enough go this dessert. always good, just wish it was a bit larger of a portion.", 
            "celebrated a birthday dinner here with some family and friends. we have all been to this and other locations and usually left content. \n\nthe food was up to par and without any real complaints or issues. few must trys: <mark>Shrimp Ceviche </mark>, <mark>Truffle Fries</mark> and pear flat bread. entree recommendations: the steak was a decent size and cooked to perfection and of course the mac and cheese, yum!! \n\nonly downfall was the service. after being passed onto another server (our first one was leaving for the night) we could already tell that either our server was having a bad night or just didn't want to serve a large party. our server wasn't friendly, helpful or very open to \"servicing\" us. to top it off when it came to paying the bill we had asked for separate checks (3 for a party of 12) he not only made it clear he was annoyed but he insulted us by rolling his eyes. being that 4 of the individuals at our table are also in the f&b industry (3 who happen to be managers of restaurants on the strip) we know seperate checks are not always a welcomed request, but in the essence of providing quality customer service at least refrain from letting your patrons see your annoyance. lastly, our original server who was \"going home for the night\" was the last employee we happened to see and wish us a \"good night\" as we left almost 2 hours later. not sure about that one."

            "a recent visit to celebrate a friend's birthday, yard house left me feeling disappointed.  we had a large party, about 14 people at the table.  during our visit, we even had a shift change, where our original waitress was kind enough to let us know she was leaving and who was taking over.  \n\nalthough the rest of our table had appetizers, the husband and i arrived in time for entrees:\n\n* new york steak salad \"green beans, roasted peppers, avocado, <mark>Crispy Brussels Sprouts & Ripped Potatoes</mark>, red onion and baby lettuce tossed in a gorgonzola vinaigrette with beefsteak tomatoes and pickled egg\" ($16.95) - a generous and flavorful salad, loaded with the ingredients listed and a tasty steak.\n\n* <mark>Cuban Roast Pork Dip</mark> \"tomatoes, <mark>Pepper Jack</mark> cheese, pickles, dijon and garlic aioli on french bread grilled with bbq au jus\" ($12.65) - this was the husband's order and i had a bite.  it wasn't that great, especially when i recall my previous experience with a cuban sandwich.  the fries were good though.\n\nmy concern was more with service.  the waiter asked the birthday girl what kind of dessert she wanted (out of three choices), and she went for the chocolate souffle cake \"mini serving with vanilla ice cream, served warm\".  when it arrived, there was no candle which surprised us all.  (how are you supposed to sing happy birthday without a candle to blow?)  and he only gave us one spoon, which reminded me that he never brought back dessert menus for the rest of us.  at this point, we didn't bother ordering dessert since the birthday girl already had hers.  that part made the experience disappointing.\n\nthe other waiter was able to do a split tender on the check, which was helpful.  (although he put the costs wrong on my receipt, oh well.)  i usually think yard house is on top of things, but i guess they weren't that night."

            "this was our first time at yard house and maybe my expectations were higher than they should've been.  the place reminded me a lot of bj's restaurant, although this place had more of a different twist to their menu.  they also serve a ton of beer!  the display of all of the beer kegs right when you enter is quite impressive!  since i'm not much of a beer drinker, i opted for the fruitier belgian drink called the lindeman's framboise.  it's seriously an alcoholic juice...very dangerous!  \n\nas for food, i think our eyes were hungrier than our stomachs!  we ordered the <mark>Truffle Fries</mark> (shredded parmesan and herbs) with a hint of garlic.  it was delish!  then we ordered the <mark>Ahi Poke Bowl </mark> with some fried wontons that were also quite tasty.  then we ordered pastrami sliders which did not meet my standards.  i have had better <mark>Pastrami Benedict Burger</mark> and this one was on the salty side.  the hubby also ordered <mark>Moo Shu Egg Rolls</mark> (no good) and chinese <mark>Chicken <mark>Shiitake <mark>Lobster Garlic Noodles</mark></mark></mark>.  maybe i was delusional to think that the <mark>Chicken <mark>Shiitake <mark>Lobster Garlic Noodles</mark></mark></mark> would come close to thanh long's.  \n\nall in all, if you want lots of beer variety and a good atmosphere, then this place is for you.  just don't expect them to excel in the food department.", 
            "came here today to take some unexpected friends out for some food. they were uber-hungover and needed some bad for you food. i had my monkeys in tow so it had to be some place loud. yard house was the answer. \n\nthe whole experience was wonderful starting from amy, the hostess (she was very bubbly and genuinely cared about how my day was going) to tracy, our server. she quickly brought out a mac n' cheese 2 for the kids (such a blessing to get quick food for little ones). we tried a bunch of different plates...like the ahi tuna <mark>Ahi Poke Bowl </mark>, <mark>Spicy Tuna Roll</mark>, <mark><mark>Deviled Eggs</mark></mark> (which i didn't have...wasn't feeling it today), <mark>Truffle Fries</mark>, a burger with no bun, a <mark>New York Steak Sandwich</mark> with <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> drizzled with some honey sauce that made me want to scream with delight. the monkeys downed the mac n cheese like it was their last meal and were blessedly quiet. \n\nwill be back again soon :)", 
            "my husband and i were meeting a friend at town square to do a little shopping, have dinner and then check out ladies night at blue martini. we decided to have dinner at yard house. \n\nalthough it seemed like it was really busy due to the number of people standing around near the hostess table, we only had to wait a couple minutes before being given the option to sit outside(quieter) or inside. we ended up sitting in a booth inside. \n\na major reason to go to yard house is the beer selection. i love lindeman's framboise, so when i saw the youngberry chocolate on the menu i had to try it.  it is lindeman's framboise & young's double chocolate stout and oh so tasty. \n\nfor my meal, i had the ahi crunch salad was good but not great, mainly due to boring veggies. the ahi was seared perfectly and well seasoned, i think i would have been better off with the <mark>Ahi Poke Bowl </mark>. \n\nwe ended up skipping blue martini. drinks were cheaper at yard house for the guys (and martinis are always $10 at yard house versus the $12+ pricetag at blue martini when it's not happy hour!!!) and the atmosphere was nice and laid back so we just stayed there. yard house is definitely a place we will go back to.", 
            "the yardhouse is a nice place to go if you're tired of the same old brews on tap. they have a fantastic and interesting selection of beers available, even if their staff sometimes can't offer much help! in their defense, though, the beer list is quite lengthy.\n\nthis particular location has a pretty nice patio with a fire pit outside that makes for some great people watching. i find that every yardhouse i've been to is always incredibly loud. maybe it's the cement floors that just ricochet the sound throughout the restaurant, but it makes for the main reason i stay away from these restaurants until a friend drags me along for happy hour.\n\nthe food is decent and i'll give them props for having a wide variety of tastes that goes well beyond your typical bar food. unfortunately, everything is only decent. people rave about the <mark>Truffle Fries</mark>, but for me personally, i've never been into the white truffle oil thing and think it tastes like gasoline - fresh truffles are another matter entirely. \nthe ahi tuna <mark>Ahi Poke Bowl </mark> is fresh and my favorite thing to order here- light soy sauce, rich avocado, a little bit of crunch and sesame oil.. great success. \nthe ahi tuna burgers on the other hand- which claim to be fresh ahi tuna that is hand chopped - automatically comes cooked well. who.. in their right mind.. cooks fresh ahi tuna well?! it's madness i tell you, and made those burgers that were once great, completely below par. if you decide to go this route - make sure you specify how you want them done!\nthe <mark><mark>Deviled Eggs</mark></mark> were a little sweet, but definitely a fun and unusual choice for a restaurant.\nahi tuna caesar salad- exactly what you'd expect.\n<mark><mark>French Onion</mark> Soup</mark> - decent, but nothing to rave about. a small bowl with provolone melted over the top, a little lighter broth than most places, the bread was okay. just okay.\n\noverall, a good happy hour with something for everyone - even a fire pit!",

            "pros:\n* delicious food. you have to try the <mark><mark>Gardein Blackened Chicken Torta</mark></mark> soup.\n* friendly staff.\n* modern menu and decor.\n\ncons:\n* expensive. the food while good is slightly too expensive.\n* due to the popularity, they're generally crowded with long waits.\n\ni believe town square to be the best shopping and restaurant plaza in las vegas. the quantity of choices for either is only matched by the quality. there certainly is no shortage of great food at town square and on yelp, yard house is rated best of them all. i haven't tried them all but i can definitely say yard house is the best i've had yet.\n\ni went with a group of four on a late tuesday afternoon. they weren't busy or crowded but i have seen the line pour out the door enough times to know i was lucky. we were promptly sat down just time to enjoy the happy hour menu. we ordered their famous tower of onion rings while we sifted through the massive menu. i ordered the <mark>Gardein Bbq Chicken Salad</mark> with a cup of <mark>Grilled Cheese & <mark><mark><mark>Organic Tomato Bisque</mark></mark></mark></mark> soup. the other members of my party ordered the barbeque <mark>Gardein Bbq Chicken Salad</mark> with a cup of <mark><mark>Gardein Blackened Chicken Torta</mark></mark> soup, pastrami sandwich, and a mushroom burger. \n\nwhen the <mark>Onion Ring Tower</mark> arrived it instantly lived up to the expectations. thin, lightly battered, crispy onion rings sprinkled with parmesan cheese and served with ranch and chipotle ranch. they bursted with flavor to die for. at first the tower seems so incredibly large but when you finish the memory feels small in hindsight. my soup and salad was good with a pleasant, creamy, rich ranch dressing and well-seasoned <mark>Grilled Cheese & <mark><mark><mark>Organic Tomato Bisque</mark></mark></mark></mark> soup. however, it paled in comparison to the nothing short of perfect, <mark><mark>Gardein Blackened Chicken Torta</mark></mark> soup. i have never had a <mark>Chicken Tortilla Soup</mark> so creamy and flavorful. they put a large piece of avocado in the cup along with the crispy tortilla strips and large chunks of chicken. together, they blend to create a truly wonderful and hearty cup of soup. i had a bite of the barbeque <mark>Gardein Bbq Chicken Salad</mark> and while it was a bit too saucy for my tastes, the barbeque dressing wasn't overpowering and went well with the large pile of onion strings atop the salad. the pastrami sandwich looked great and the burger looked even better. the burger bun instantly caught my eye with a smooth crisp surface devoid of any grease or sheen. next time i will surely try a burger. \n\nthe town square location is large and wide open. the lighting is dim and creates a hip vibe that went well with the modern menu. everyone in my group had a few questions about the menu and the server was friendly, knowledgeable, and willing to help. the prices however are a bit steep and you might want to arrive early to take advantage of the happy hour choices. one specific item that caught my eye was the 17 dollar macaroni and cheese. it looked delicious but it would have to be at that price.\n\nin the end i walked away satisfied and yearning to return to try a burger or maybe even that posh mac and cheese entree.", 
            "two words: <mark>Chicken Tortilla Soup</mark>!!!!!!!!\n\nthat's all.\n\ncrap, that's 4 words.", 
            "i know that the <mark>Chicken Tortilla Soup</mark> here is pretty bomb but wheres the service and the people bringing out the food? i was here last saturday night and it took over 15 minutes for someone to even greet us or acknowledge our presence. the host seated us immediately but making us wait that long to acknowledge that we were there didn't impress me. not to mention that the person that came over just came to tell us that our server was coming back from her break shortly. still, not impressed. we ended up leaving because getting someone to take our order took much too long and we had to catch a movie.", 
            "pop quiz: how sad is it that eating at this yard house was one of my most anticipated moments before getting on the plane and heading out to las vegas for a few days? gambling, glitz, girls and other words that start with \"g\" are all fine and dandy, but sometimes a guy just wants to down a few beers, chomp on some outstanding food and unwind in a place where not everyone is a raging tourist carrying an over-sized plastic drink that is watered down and reeks of desperation. this is that place.\n\nmy folks and i actually made it over here before they opened on a monday morning and people were already lined up at 10:50 a.m. that's cool, right? this place clearly has a faithful audience, as evidenced by this review. and once those doors opened, shoot: it's like the customers in line thought the first 10 people in the door got a free unicorn that performs karaoke exclusively to hair metal songs. they rushed the door with a fervent desire to be first in and we just sort of meandered in after them. it's a big place with plenty of seats - there's no point in scrambling over each other to be the first one in. there's a lengthy patio, a surrounded bar and more seating than the average bar would know what to do with.\n\na hostess guided us to a booth opposite a table of nine individuals who exemplified the \"money cannot buy class\" rule. we overheard them tell the waitress they had to be out of there to catch a movie so right away you could tell this had potential to be the table from hell. we already felt for this gal and then we realized she was waiting on us, too! let it be known that tasha, our waitress, got the mvp award for eternity during this shift because when the place opened, it appeared she got triple sat right out of the gate. now i'm not an expert in the service industry but i know how hard it is to recover from a hand dealt like that in the opening minutes. we assured her we were in no rush, mostly because we weren't, and partly because we did not want to witness a breakdown on the floor. to her credit, she kept her cool and was efficient as she was sassy.\n\nspeaking of keeping cool, you might want to psych yourself up before eating here because the menu is positively dickensian with its verbiage. six pages of beer alone?! no, you have not died and gone to heaven; you just happened to wander into a place thriving with variety. being that we stopped in for lunch, we stuck with sandwiches and the must-have lunch combo: a cup of soup and half a sandwich/pizza. mom's <mark>Grilled Chicken & Avocado</mark> sandwich was polished off with ease, dad's... whatever dad ate, was equally delicious, and my <mark>Chicken Tortilla Soup</mark> and <mark>Pepperoni Pizza</mark> were wolfed down in a shameful display almost as noticeable as my preference for hopping around the beer menu: big sky moose drool can totally give way to kronenbourg 1664 if you try.\n\nand through it all tasha managed the suffocating requests of her demanding table, a performance that would go unnoticed if you were not paying attention given that everyone working here is a study in quick service and attentiveness. food runners actually running food? hostesses navigating the dining room with purpose? bartenders keeping their orders flowing? you'd better believe it. we did not see a manager but i am assuming one was on duty, probably sitting in the rafters like batman/woman, waiting to pounce when the need makes itself known.\n\nthere was one last bit of unfinished business: dessert. i'll just say this now: order the s'more brownie item. it will change your life. as the owner and operator of a beard and mustache, it almost made me consider shaving them off due to me realizing hot marshmallow embedded into my hair is not the most glamorous feeling. but wow if that was not the best way to go into a sugar coma that i have had the pleasure of eating in quite a while.\n\nyes, yard house is a chain and yes, you know what you're getting by eating at one. but this one in particular has service and set up down to an art form. more tvs than you could ever watch? extensive seating? a prime location away from most of the touristy things? absolutely. and believe the hype, too - until the owners build one of these in dallas, tx (hint, hint), it will remain a \"must-go\" destination for any upcoming las vegas trips. who am i kidding? even after they build one in dallas, tx (nudge, nudge), i'll still be stopping here.", 
            "our first time on yard house\n\n\nhi everyone today we decided to have a lunch at yard house \nwe believed is going to be great \nbut we had a terrible experience with the customer service for some reason we had four different waiters  ridiculous on my own personal opinion.\nany way we order a <mark>Chicken Tortilla Soup</mark>  really good loved \nbut the steak tacos was bad and we order a carnitas tacos (means pork) and we get a chicken tacos,\n\nmy burger was good half goat and half beef good flavor.\n\nafter a while we told the waiter we order a pork tacos no chicken and takes forever to come back for our table carnitas tacos are bad we don't liked \nnext time when you guys  recommend tacos    give us the choice  on flour or corn tortillas \n\nthis is the cherry at the end of the cake check this out \nthe manager came to talk whit us \nand he said i'm apologize for all the inconvenience but something they i can do for you and i explain everything then you guys already knows and i ask a couple questions from the menu and he don't so have the answers for my and again he said i'm apologizing \nmy reaction was try to fix this little problem because your food is ok but your service is terrible and he said i'm going to give you a free desert for the inconvenience \n\nalright the desert was the only good think from the whole time the we spend on this restaurant  \n\ni guess we had a bad luck :(\ndefinitely i'm not going to come back to this place"

            "surprisingly good food all around. i got to try a lot of things, including a blue crab cake hoagie with house <mark><mark>Classic Ranch Salad</mark></mark> (lunch menu), <mark>Chicken Nachos</mark>, <mark>Onion Ring Tower</mark>, <mark>Fried Calamari</mark>, and <mark><mark>Gardein Fried Chicken Strips</mark></mark> w/ fries (disclaimer: didn't double-check the menu, so not all names of food items may be accurate). for some reason, out of all of those, i found myself munching on the fries and dipping them on the honey mustard that accompanied the chicken. i guess the fries were just in the sweet spot of crunchiness and fluffiness, and the honey mustard was way too addictive. i can't speak for the beer, but everybody at my table seemed to enjoy theirs and they have a huge selection. finally,  gotta love a place that plays some beatles and some george harrison.\n\ni also wanted to add a tip for finding this place. gotta locate it before you can enjoy it, you know? it's kinda hidden if you're driving along most of the streets, so locate it on a map of town square beforehand or else just park somewhere and walk around. i think it might be best if you park near h&m and take the alley that starts off with the sushi bar and yogurtland, then walk past the \"clearing\" in the middle. you should see it on the right.",

            "the first time coming here, i was pretty impressed that they had a vegetarian menu. that was already a plus for me. i came here with family that had come into town and almost all of us ordered vegetarian. we had hummus and pita, <mark>Truffle Fries</mark>, <mark><mark>Deviled Eggs</mark></mark>,the gardein <mark><mark>Gardein Orange Peel Chicken</mark></mark>, the gardein <mark>Penne with Chicken</mark>, and  hongos y rajas tacos. they were all really good. i was impressed. many places that offer vegetarian dishes mess them up by adding too much of something, whether it's tofu or vegetables. in this case, the gardein products were utilized perfectly. for dessert, we had a mini creme brulee, a mini peach apple <mark>Cobb</mark>, and a mini lemon souffle. this entire meal was demolished by my family. the only reason i gave it 4 stars is because i ordered root beer thinking that a place that makes their own beer would make their own homeade root beer and cream soda. sadly, they only had barq's root beer. what a disappointment! i will definitely come back and enjoy more selections next time.\n\n\nthat was my last review.\n\nhere's an update. last time i went to yardhouse, i ordered vegetarian jerk wings. they were pretty good until i realized the wings were definitely not vegetarian. that is a mistake a restaurant should never make. luckily, i'm not a customer who likes to cause problems since i work in the industry but i was shocked that happened. for that, i demoted yardhouse.",

            "***disclaimer - really long review in regards to late night happy hour not being honored on st. patrick's day\n\ncame to yard house at town square to celebrate my birthday with my husband and i was very excited to order quite a bit of things on the menu, both food and drink.  however, i was very disappointed to find out that happy hour was not being honored.  my birthday is on st patricks day and the server informed me that there was no happy hour because it was a holiday.  i informed the server that it's not a national holiday and there happy hour policy on their menu does not state that holidays are not included.  we were not informed when we entered the restaurant that there was no happy hour.  we were also not informed when we were seated and our first orders were taken that there was no happy hour.  if my husband had not inquired if a certain beer was on the happy hour menu, i believe we would not have been informed that happy hour was not being honored.  \n\nmy evening was ruined because there was no happy hour.  i did not want to order as many items as i would have liked because there was no happy hour.  my husband did not want to cause a scene that evening so i did not ask for a manager that night.  \n\nthe food that we did order was good for the most part, but it wasn't great.  we ordered the spicy tuna and <mark><mark>California Roll</mark></mark>.  the spicy tuna was good but the <mark><mark>California Roll</mark></mark>'s rice was hard and undercooked.  the hummus lacked flavor.  the only really good thing i ate was the jamaican jerk wings.  \n\nthe next day i called other yard house's in las vegas and the one at red rock informed me that they honor happy hour on holidays, it just depended on which holiday.  they said it was at the manager's discretion.  they said that they had happy hour but only from 3 p.m. - 6 p.m. and not the late night happy hour.  i also called blue martini, mcfaddens, and buffalo wild wings who said they had happy hour on st. patricks day.  \n\ni then called the yard house at town square and asked to speak to a manager.  i spoke to leo and he informed me that the policy for no happy hour came from corporate.  he informed me that customers were being informed at the door that there was no happy hour and i informed him that was not the case with us.  he explained there was nothing he could do for me because corporate sent that policy.  he informed me that no yard house in the country had late night happy hour on st. patrick's day.  i asked him for the number to corporate and thanked the manager for his time.  \n\ni then called four other yard houses in the country and three out of the four said they had happy hour both early and late, even though it was st. patrick's day.  i contacted corporate and left a message since it was after hours.  i waited 2 days but heard nothing back.  i called corporate again on friday, march 21 and spoke to customer service who researched the information for me.  he was first unaware of the policy so he said he would contact the yard house in town square and give me a call back.  after calling back he informed me that there may have been some miscommunication and that he was new and that is why he may not have heard of the happy hour policy for st. patrick's day.  he asked if the manager at yard house did anything for me and i informed him that he did not.  in the end, he said he would do more research and send me some gift certificates in the mail.  \n\nas of 3/28/14.  i have not received them but he did say they would take approximately 7-10 business days.\n\nall in all, i was just very disappointed with the way they went about the happy hour policy.  they should have made a sign out front or placed a note on the menu, or trained all staff to inform everyone before they were seated.",

            "went here last night for dinner to try again after my last visit. i have to say the service was prompt and our drinks came out almost immediately. tim was our waiter first (then it changed to heather later in the evening). \n\ni ordered the <mark><mark>California Roll</mark></mark> for an appetizer, and it was superb. the food took a little time to come out, but honestly the place was packed so i understand.\n\nfor dinner we ordered the mac and cheese and the applewood smoked bacon burger. both entrees were piping hot, and delicious, which satisfied my disappointment over my last visit. heather took great care of us, and because of her i will be back.",

            "after and independent of a uye, when i join my yelp friends for socializing at the yard house, it becomes the yelp house. the yard house is a fun place for groups of friends to hang out over beer and good food. the restaurant does a commendable job accommodating large groups. both times that i went to the yard house we had no problem getting a large table. the service is precise. and when it is time to pay, we had our own checks. substitute yelpers for a gathering of general friends, or a date and the yard house is everybody's social house.\n\n  the yard house is my choice chain restaurant for beer selection. the yard house is to beer what baskin robbins is to ice cream. whereas baskin robbins features 31 flavors of ice cream,, the yard house features approximately 600 flavors of beer (i counted the beer listed in the menu). if i were to go to the yard house one friday a week to order a flavor of beer, according to my math it would take me 12 years to done this. or if i were to go to the yard house everyday to try a flavor of beer, it would take me 2 years to do this. some of the beers may have been listed under a couple of different headings. the deal is that the yard house selection of beer is as good as it gets. \n\n  there are eleven series of beer. there is the chalkboard series. the cider series is the seasonals. the light beer is less than 5.8% alcohol content. this series includes many of the name brands such as michelob and budweiser. there is the honey fruit series which includes bbc strawberry blonde and blue point blueberry. there is the wheat series that includes blue hawaiin hefeweizen. the malty series includes bass ale and alaskin amber. the dark series includes big sky moose drool and bison organic chocolate. the bitter series includes anchor liberty and blue point hoptical illusion. and there is the strong and effervescent series. the menu lists the alcohol content. unless i overlooked something, the allagash curieux is the strongest at 11% alcohol content. there are three sizes of beer. i went for the middle size which is the pint. for the record i greatly appreciated the firestone.\n\n  this very yard house features a happy hour and late night specials. the happy hour is monday-friday 3-6 pm and late night special sunday-wednesday 10-close. they include domestic pints from $4.25-$5.75, well drinks $4.27-$4.75 and wine by glass $2 off. if you are up to food there are half price appetizers & pizza.\n\n  the food is good but i've tasted better. my complaint about the <mark><mark>Roasted Turkey Club</mark></mark> is that it was layers of sandwich instead of the sandwich i am accustomed to. the <mark>Classic Cheese</mark> was a good choice. the fries are these skinny things that remind me of potato sticks. i feel that the yard house ought to expand their fries selection to include steak fries and just thicker fries.\n\n  when i socialize at a restaurant, i am big on the music that is playing. i was won over by the music playing. i heard great music from led zeppelin, the rolling stones and classic rock era.\n\n  the yard house excells at their selection of beer. whether it is my yelp house or social house i intend to return. when i return i plan to try the blue point blueberry beer that is brewed in blue point, ny; 5 miles south of where i lived. gotta be patriotic to my home town.\n\ndaniel. s yelp 100 challenge. review 72", 
            "enjoyed my time here a lot. it's a cozy large restaurant with booth and table seating. i arrived here with my sister on a stifling hot monday afternoon. we were quickly seated at a table and greeted about five minutes later by our server seth, who brought out our hibiscus tea and water. he was efficient and friendly and made great menu recommendations. we don't eat much at one sitting so we went straight in and my sister ordered their <mark>Classic Cheese</mark> burger with fries and i ordered the <mark>Shrimp <mark><mark>Gardein Orange Peel Chicken</mark> Rice Bowl</mark></mark> with rice. one thing i noticed was their drink selection was enormous. drafts, cocktails, mixed drinks and margaritas you name it they know it. looked like a great happy hour spot if only we could've came at 10 pm. but it was ok, once our food came out i was very happy with my choice as i love veggies with my food and this place did a <mark>Chicken <mark>Shrimp <mark><mark>Gardein Orange Peel Chicken</mark> Rice Bowl</mark></mark></mark> with veggies and shrimp perfectly. since we were pressed for time we did not stay long but overall satisfied with the experience, i recommend going for happy hour on the weekdays so your server isn't rushed because i got that vibe a few times from the look of the servers there. would go for happy hour!"

            "what can i say about the only place i have found in town that has my favorite beer on tap?\n\nyardhouse is a beer aficionado's dream come true. with over 100+ beers on tap i am sure you will find something that ya like. \n\ni strongly recommend coming in during happy hour. weekdays from 3-7 and 10-close (except for fridays) means almost all of their appetizers are half off, on top of that, they have $7 sliders, and cheap pizzas as well. the classic rock and continuously flowing drinks make this place a perfect place to hang out and chill if you want to go out with friends.\n\nthe food here is usually a step above the bar food found at similar establishments. yes they do have nachos, pizza, but they have more adventurous fare such as hummus and pita, double stacked chicken enchiladas, tuna tar tar, and so on. i will give them props for food that you wouldn't think they would. but the thing that makes this place amazing, like a few other fellow yelpers mentioned is the... <mark>Turkey Burger</mark>! i don't know what they do to they turkey, but they make it delicious. succulent turkey paired with herbs, cheeses and thin slithers of roma tomatoes make this one of the best <mark>Turkey Burger</mark> i have had. definitely give it a try.\n\nof course one of the coolest things about all yardhouses is what i call the keg exhibition. ever yardhouse has a large room where they store the 100+ kegs in cold ice-cold fridge. large windows allow pass-er-bys to gawk at the beauties. \n\nthe location in town square is similar to the other ones around the country. a standard restaurant space consisting of booths and tables. a large central bar in the middle, and a ton of pipes which make the draft beers possible.", 
            "i stopped in for a work lunch today and noticed that they have changed some things on their menu.  there are these little u's next to menu items that are under 600 calories, and to my pleasant surprise, they had a 5 oz. <mark>Turkey Burger</mark> with a salad with cirtrus soy dressing with a u next to it.  fan-effin-tastic!!  i ordered it, despite thinking of every dry, tasteless \"healthy\" burger i've ever eaten.  my expectations were low.  granted, i've never ordered anything at yardhouse before that i didn't like, but the pessimism from my experience with healthy non-beef burgers trumped my consistent satisfaction with the food from yardhouse.  \n\nour meals came quickly and my neat little plate of burger and salad (with dressing on the side, which i didn't even ask for, thanks server!!!) actually looked quite delicious.  upon my first bite, i was in heaven!  it was juicy, tasty, delicious goodness in my mouth.  it came topped with roma tomatoes, which i think really sealed the deal.  at 5 ounces, i finished my entire plate and felt perfectly full, unlike most of the time when i go out to lunch and overstuff my face.  i was so happy that i promptly forgot about the annoying sales rep i had dealt with at a meeting earlier that morning. i was ready to go back to work with a renewed pep in my step.\n\nthe service at yardhouse is always fast, efficient and friendly.  although, i used to have this one server that would always try to upsell shots and drinks during my business meetings.  it was quite awkward, but i haven't seen him the last few times i've been, so maybe he quit when he realized the lunch crowd here was not exactly his demo.  we've always been able to get a table quickly for both lunch and dinners.  i also love sitting at the bar sometimes at night and trying new beers from their vast selection.\n\nyardhouse is just an all-around great spot!", 
            "just like their other locations the happy hour (3-6pm) is great & well worth checking out.  you get $1 off beers and select half price appetizers.\n\nwe had the firecracker wings and the <mark>Turkey Burger</mark> sliders - both were very good.\n\nwe shared the salted caramel (or it might be butterscotch) dessert which was also great.\n\ncan't wait for my next visit to a yard house & continue to wish they would open a location in nm.", 
            "i went back and tried something i wouldn't normally get on the menu (<mark>Turkey Burger</mark>).  i must say it is the tastiest <mark>Turkey Burger</mark> i've had to date!  i look forward to trying other items on the menu now that i've gotten more direction from fellow yelpers!", 
            "the yard house is always a go to restaurant when we have a bigger group, simply because they have a huge menu with a wide variety of choices. the apps are always tasty, my hubby loves the chicken wings and <mark>Lettuce Wraps</mark>, the <mark>Onion Ring Tower</mark> does not disappoint either, if you know what i mean. the <mark>Chicken Nachos</mark> are big enough to definitely share with a few people, and the shushimi is very good, as well. we've tried the burgers ( i like the <mark>Turkey Burger</mark> a lot), the <mark>Street Tacos</mark> are excellent, pasta dishes look good (although i haven't tried any yet) and the <mark>Pan Seared Ahi</mark> and <mark>Ginger Crusted Norwegian Salmon</mark> are tasty. there's a good kids menu, lots of beers to play around with, full bar. service has always been excellent and the atmosphere can be loud, but it's casual, too. we have eaten inside, but prefer outside. \nit's moderately priced for that type of restaurant, typically for our family of 4 the bill is $80-100, that's dinners with a beer or a cocktail.", 
            "we came here to celebrate two birthdays in our party and all the waiter did was say you can hang out a little. that's the first time i've ever gone out to celebrate a birthday and they did absolutely nothing but a snide remark. this was a family affair. the waiter was insensitive. we probably should have called a manager. i've been writing for tripsheet magazine for 15 years and will let the know in my dining and entertainment column. some 12,000 cab and limo drivers will know not to take birthday parties to the yard house. my wife was in charge of organizing and both my wife and daughter reminded the waiter. he still got a good tip. we are loyal customers of this establishment. they sent me a $25 gift certificate so my wife and i came back for a late night dinner. i was between the full rack of <mark>St. Louis Style Bbq Ribs</mark> and the <mark>Rib Eye</mark> steak and the waiter try the steak. it was juicy and delicious. it came with broccolini with too much salt, mashed potatoes and i guess they forget the creamed corn. my wife had the <mark>Turkey Burger</mark> which was good. this place was packed on a thursday night."

            "a recent visit to celebrate a friend's birthday, yard house left me feeling disappointed.  we had a large party, about 14 people at the table.  during our visit, we even had a shift change, where our original waitress was kind enough to let us know she was leaving and who was taking over.  \n\nalthough the rest of our table had appetizers, the husband and i arrived in time for entrees:\n\n* new york steak salad \"green beans, roasted peppers, avocado, <mark>Crispy Brussels Sprouts & Ripped Potatoes</mark>, red onion and baby lettuce tossed in a gorgonzola vinaigrette with beefsteak tomatoes and pickled egg\" ($16.95) - a generous and flavorful salad, loaded with the ingredients listed and a tasty steak.\n\n* <mark>Cuban Roast Pork Dip</mark> \"tomatoes, <mark>Pepper Jack</mark> cheese, pickles, dijon and garlic aioli on french bread grilled with bbq au jus\" ($12.65) - this was the husband's order and i had a bite.  it wasn't that great, especially when i recall my previous experience with a cuban sandwich.  the fries were good though.\n\nmy concern was more with service.  the waiter asked the birthday girl what kind of dessert she wanted (out of three choices), and she went for the chocolate souffle cake \"mini serving with vanilla ice cream, served warm\".  when it arrived, there was no candle which surprised us all.  (how are you supposed to sing happy birthday without a candle to blow?)  and he only gave us one spoon, which reminded me that he never brought back dessert menus for the rest of us.  at this point, we didn't bother ordering dessert since the birthday girl already had hers.  that part made the experience disappointing.\n\nthe other waiter was able to do a split tender on the check, which was helpful.  (although he put the costs wrong on my receipt, oh well.)  i usually think yard house is on top of things, but i guess they weren't that night.", 
            "this is gonna sound like a recurring theme, but i came here for a friend's birthday dinner. not sure about the other yard house locations, but this place is gigantic. ample indoor and outdoor seating with enough tvs to watch any and every sports game.\n\nwith their burgers, asian influenced fare, pastas, and gardein selections, their menu has something for everyone and it's just a matter of deciding what you want most. eventually, i settled on a surf and turf burger, which has a beef patty topped with lobster, grilled asparagus, and a swiss and tomato b\\u00e9arnaise. the burger was all right, but i should've gone with my gut instinct and ordered the <mark>Pepper Jack</mark> burger. i dipped my fries into the b\\u00e9arnaise instead of putting it on my burger. oops. let me just say that i'm just a sucker for crisp fries and savory dipping sauces.\n\nfigured i might as well get a drink since i could walk it off around town square. one hpnotini for me please! it's a balanced mix of pineapple juice, pineapple rum, hpnotiq, and vodka. basically, sweet + fruity + alcohol = girly drink. i'd drink it again, but i'd want to try their snake bite, the birthday guy's favorite, before making repeat orders.\n\neven with about 20 or more people in our group, the wait staff never stopped being accommodating, patient, and attentive. major kudos to them for being amazing to us despite having a full house on a saturday night.\n\ncelebration or not, town square's yard house is a hot and casual spot for watching the game with some pals or get-togethers for a meal."

            "doesn't everyone love yardhouse? their happy hour is awesome.\n\nwe gave them 4 stars, because overall they are wonderful. however, beware because they do have their bad nights. \n\ntonight, we both ordered cups of <mark><mark><mark>Clam Chowder</mark></mark></mark> and one came out filled to the top and the other was way below the rim.\n\nthen our <mark>Gardein Grilled Chicken & Avocado Sandwich</mark> came out uncooked!!! we sent it back and the manager was nice enough to come out and offer us more food & dessert on him.\n\ni have had the <mark>Grilled Cheese & <mark><mark><mark>Organic Tomato Bisque</mark></mark></mark></mark> before and it was really good. tonight, it wasn't good. i was very disappointed, because i love tomato/<mark>Grilled Cheese & <mark><mark><mark>Organic Tomato Bisque</mark></mark></mark></mark> soup.\n\nwe definitely wanted to note that they have very good service. when you ask for a box, they do it for you instead of giving you a box to do it yourself. they even write the date and what food is inside of the box in the corner! little things like that really do make a difference.", 
            "i ordered the bbq burger on wheat and the organic <mark>Grilled Cheese & <mark><mark><mark>Organic Tomato Bisque</mark></mark></mark></mark>. the food came out quickly and was very delicious. the soup had a nice flavor. the burger was cooked perfectly and very juicy. pretty good service also. sat outside on the patio because it was a beautiful day.", 
            "pros:\n* delicious food. you have to try the <mark><mark>Gardein Blackened Chicken Torta</mark></mark> soup.\n* friendly staff.\n* modern menu and decor.\n\ncons:\n* expensive. the food while good is slightly too expensive.\n* due to the popularity, they're generally crowded with long waits.\n\ni believe town square to be the best shopping and restaurant plaza in las vegas. the quantity of choices for either is only matched by the quality. there certainly is no shortage of great food at town square and on yelp, yard house is rated best of them all. i haven't tried them all but i can definitely say yard house is the best i've had yet.\n\ni went with a group of four on a late tuesday afternoon. they weren't busy or crowded but i have seen the line pour out the door enough times to know i was lucky. we were promptly sat down just time to enjoy the happy hour menu. we ordered their famous tower of onion rings while we sifted through the massive menu. i ordered the <mark>Gardein Bbq Chicken Salad</mark> with a cup of <mark>Grilled Cheese & <mark><mark><mark>Organic Tomato Bisque</mark></mark></mark></mark> soup. the other members of my party ordered the barbeque <mark>Gardein Bbq Chicken Salad</mark> with a cup of <mark><mark>Gardein Blackened Chicken Torta</mark></mark> soup, pastrami sandwich, and a mushroom burger. \n\nwhen the <mark>Onion Ring Tower</mark> arrived it instantly lived up to the expectations. thin, lightly battered, crispy onion rings sprinkled with parmesan cheese and served with ranch and chipotle ranch. they bursted with flavor to die for. at first the tower seems so incredibly large but when you finish the memory feels small in hindsight. my soup and salad was good with a pleasant, creamy, rich ranch dressing and well-seasoned <mark>Grilled Cheese & <mark><mark><mark>Organic Tomato Bisque</mark></mark></mark></mark> soup. however, it paled in comparison to the nothing short of perfect, <mark><mark>Gardein Blackened Chicken Torta</mark></mark> soup. i have never had a <mark>Chicken Tortilla Soup</mark> so creamy and flavorful. they put a large piece of avocado in the cup along with the crispy tortilla strips and large chunks of chicken. together, they blend to create a truly wonderful and hearty cup of soup. i had a bite of the barbeque <mark>Gardein Bbq Chicken Salad</mark> and while it was a bit too saucy for my tastes, the barbeque dressing wasn't overpowering and went well with the large pile of onion strings atop the salad. the pastrami sandwich looked great and the burger looked even better. the burger bun instantly caught my eye with a smooth crisp surface devoid of any grease or sheen. next time i will surely try a burger. \n\nthe town square location is large and wide open. the lighting is dim and creates a hip vibe that went well with the modern menu. everyone in my group had a few questions about the menu and the server was friendly, knowledgeable, and willing to help. the prices however are a bit steep and you might want to arrive early to take advantage of the happy hour choices. one specific item that caught my eye was the 17 dollar macaroni and cheese. it looked delicious but it would have to be at that price.\n\nin the end i walked away satisfied and yearning to return to try a burger or maybe even that posh mac and cheese entree.", 
            "been coming here for years. i always get the <mark>Grilled Cheese & <mark><mark><mark>Organic Tomato Bisque</mark></mark></mark></mark> soup to start delish! its very light and creamy with a touch of basil and homemade croutons. for the entree i can never resist one of two items.\n 1) truffle mac and cheese 2) <mark>Pan Seared Ahi</mark> dinner.\nmac & cheese- very cheesy/creamy, bits of bacon and a truffle glaze\nahi- <mark>Pan Seared Ahi</mark> drenched in a chinese black bean sauce with crisp basil on a bed of brown rice.\nthese items are a must try!\nand now for the fun part.... the beer! \n***young's double chocolate stout- omg its desert in a glass.\n***big sky moose drool- a creamy, slightly hoppy beer you could pair it with anything\n***house honey blonde- the perfect summer beer. amazingly refreshing\n***sam adams cherry wheat-  the best sam adams has to offer! a bright cherry flavored wheat beer with a crisp finish.. delish!\n***chimay triple- slight raisin taste with a touch of hops.. yum! perfect before dinner beer.\n\nwhy only 3 stars? the bar service is terrible. this location and red rock.",

            "yard house is a pretty solid place when it comes to good food, good drink and a great place to meet up with your friends or watch the game. i mean where can you go wrong when a place has more beers on tap than you can really think of? unfortunately, the beer selection does vary a bit state by state but you should be able to find something you enjoy. \n\nsome of my personal favorites include their <mark><mark><mark>Clam Chowder</mark></mark></mark>, the <mark>Pan Seared Ahi</mark> and the sliders. granted, i do my best to vary it up as much as possible because their menu is so vast. \n\nmake sure to call ahead on busy friday and saturday evenings as this place does get packed and the wait times can exceed one hour.", 
            "easily the best place to eat in ts without spending tons of money (ahem, texas de brazil). \n\nlove, love, love the food here! actually, i need to amend that. i've had the same entree every time i've gone to the yardhouse. every time. it's that good. the <mark>Pan Seared Ahi</mark> <mark>New York Steak Sandwich</mark>. the fish is always excellent quality and very fresh. onions caramelized to melt-in-my-mouth goodness. and the garlic aioli...i'd take a bath in it if i could. \n\nanyway, everyone else i've gone with says the other entrees are also delicious. the appetizers are pretty tasty, notably the <mark>Grilled Artichoke</mark>. the <mark>Onion Ring Tower</mark> is also worth a try! the house brews are really good. can't say anything about dessert, as i've always been too full from dinner and beer to smash more food into my belly. \n\nthis is one of those places that gets very crowded, so be prepared for a wait. obviously, if you're flexible about where you sit, you sit faster. fyi: they keep the patio tables open during the winter, but they pull down canvas \"walls\" and crank up space heaters to keep the warm in and cold out, so don't immediately pass up the patio when it's chilly!\n\nthe service is nothing special, but is also not terrible. they also play sports on the tvs, if you're into that sort of thing ;)\n\nyardhouse is another staple!",

            "i've been to yard house quite a few times. i often frequent this place with friends or bring out of town guests here because the menu is extensive and there is something on it for just about everyone. plus the beer selection, as well as the wine, and mixed drinks have the ability to please every palate. \n\nrecently i brought my sister and brother-in-law here based off of those facts. three people with probably rather different tastes is kind of a hard combo to deal with when choosing a dining spot. luckily, yard house did the trick. \n\nthere was a wait when we arrived, but it was only about 10 minutes and we were seated in a large, comfy booth, although next to the kitchen and a bit noisy, it was okay as we could all still carry on a conversation without yelling to be heard. \n\nthe run down of the food went as following -\n\n<mark>Grilled Artichoke</mark> appetizer - delicious! the artichoke was grilled perfectly and served with a garlic dipping sauce. we ate every bite and then tried to eat more. baked potato chips were also served with it, the perfect appetizer.\n\n<mark>Pan Seared Ahi</mark> <mark>New York Steak Sandwich</mark> - okay, this was just about the best thing i've had to eat in a long time. the ahi was seared perfectly, somewhat cooked around the outside, and deliciously raw on the inside. the pairings in the sandwich were perfect- spinach, swiss cheese, tomato, and caramelized onions. it comes on a rye bread and with shoe-string french fries. honestly, this sandwich is worth every penny. \n\n<mark>Cuban Roast Pork Dip</mark> - my sister ordered this sandwich and it looked very good. it came with a bbq au jus and shoe-string french fries. \n\nhouse salad & <mark><mark><mark>Clam Chowder</mark></mark></mark> - my brother-in-law opted for this. the soup came out piping hot and he said it was really good. my sister declared it to be good too. the house salad was big, much bigger than i was expecting, so kudos to yh on the portions. \n\noverall i have to give it up to yard house. this most recent visit was definitely a 5 star affair. everything was cooked well, service was good, the wait wasn't long, the noise level was decent, and  we were in and out with zero problems.", 
            "quick note about this yard house....i have never been past the bar area.  this review is for my experience drinking and eating at the bar.  as for service, i have to give them at lest 4 stars.  the team here always makes sure that your fully hydrated with whatever you're drinking.  as for the food here, i've eaten at plenty yard house's in las vegas and california.  when it comes to this specific yard house, it's mainly just appetizers and during happy hour.  the calamari, <mark>Pan Seared Ahi</mark>, and sliders are mu favorites here. i think prices are inexpensive, especially during hh, and because the service is pretty good, i have to state that i do recommend.",

            "i've been here twice over the past 3 months, first trip 5 stars, second 3 stars, average 4 stars.  the atmosphere is really inviting, great for groups and reflective of what a tap house should be.\n\nfirst trip i ordered the half order jambalaya, second trip the <mark>Pan Seared Ahi</mark> tuna sandwich on rye.  \n\nit's hard to make a good jambalaya that isn't too salty, most are, and the yh hit it on the head.  the shrimp were large, and sat on top a cup plateau of rice, with the chicken, crawfish, and sausage in a moat of spicy cream sauce around.  some of the best jambalaya i've had and would certainly order again.\n\nthe second round was the ahi tuna sandwich.  i was a little suspect out the gate with it coming on rye, but had a little trust from the last trip and how great the jambalaya was.  as the plate sat down, i could tell the ahi tuna was not seared to rare, but more of a medium well, cooked white with only traces of pink, bummer.  hoping the toasted rye bread would compliment the meat and somewhat pickup where it left off, it didn't, and just made the sandwich more difficult to handle, literally.  on the upside, the peppercorn aioli and caramelized onions saved the sandwich from a certain fate in the back kitchen's garbage can.  normally, i would have sent it back, but i was with my boss for dinner and decided to suck it up rather than act like a food snob for \"overcooking cooking my ahi tuna\", not a good look.\n\nthis place is pricey, perhaps over priced in some respect, but if they can pull off all their dishes as well as they did the jambalaya, i'll come back for not just the beer.",

            "lets preface how i even ended up here: \n\ni was having a bad week (i got sick with a stomach virus, sick boyfriend, dog got sick from ingesting cat litter pellets, water heater broke, fought with my mom on her birthday call, neighbors stole my trashcans, my iphone broke) so the yelperazzi got together to try to turn things around. it's a real yelp success story....we came as strangers and discovered friends. i mean i adore a lot of people on yelp, but i'm particularly lucky to have met jieun l, anthony m., elnino f, and andy t who cared \nenough to get me out of the house and get me out of my birthday funk.  my bf reads my reviews and he also turned everything around with the small things. thank you guys and i love you all. \n\nbeers are here so i have a hard time not liking this chain...with the circumstance above though i was in that kind of mood to almost hate everything because i'm reserved to being \"done with\" today. it's extra kudos to the yardhouse reliable brews, decent food and our server that i still enjoyed the restaurant. yeah there are setbacks like any spots but drink selections make me happy so it was a good choice to turn around any bad day. our server (mitch) was pretty good in service, had good beer recommendations and he also brought me a happy birthday brownie sundae (yay!). nachos were pretty good and loaded with stuff. <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> maple bacon sauce was delish that i want to pour that on just about every breakfast item. ceviche spoons were fresh and light. <mark>Chicken <mark>Shiitake <mark>Lobster Garlic Noodles</mark></mark></mark>- good but go for the plain <mark>Chicken <mark>Shiitake <mark>Lobster Garlic Noodles</mark></mark></mark>. there was chicken, tofu, mushrooms, edamame, asparagus, chives, garlic, cheese and it's too much at once. simple is better with <mark>Chicken <mark>Shiitake <mark>Lobster Garlic Noodles</mark></mark></mark>.\n\nbf found a favorite beer worth mentioning- rogue dry hopped red. smooth with a bit of hops...a good choice to baby step into the ipas and dipas. he liked it much so that we went back 4days later to order this beer again...we never order twice since our goal is to drink down the whole list (past halfway). \n\na few drinks and plates in we were laughing so hard that i was snorting. i mean, i like never do that unless i'm really fighting hard to stop laughing. anthony has awesome one liners. jieun makes funny beer faces. elnino is a violent funny drunk. my bf coined some t-shirt worthy terms at the table. andy is just a g and always for a good time. \n\ni expected to go home from work, eat lunch and stay home alone until my bf can get off, head to dinner and go sleep and forget about the day even being my birthday. \n\neverything is alright when you have good company to make you smile.", 
            "this was our first time at yard house and maybe my expectations were higher than they should've been.  the place reminded me a lot of bj's restaurant, although this place had more of a different twist to their menu.  they also serve a ton of beer!  the display of all of the beer kegs right when you enter is quite impressive!  since i'm not much of a beer drinker, i opted for the fruitier belgian drink called the lindeman's framboise.  it's seriously an alcoholic juice...very dangerous!  \n\nas for food, i think our eyes were hungrier than our stomachs!  we ordered the <mark>Truffle Fries</mark> (shredded parmesan and herbs) with a hint of garlic.  it was delish!  then we ordered the <mark>Ahi Poke Bowl </mark> with some fried wontons that were also quite tasty.  then we ordered pastrami sliders which did not meet my standards.  i have had better <mark>Pastrami Benedict Burger</mark> and this one was on the salty side.  the hubby also ordered <mark>Moo Shu Egg Rolls</mark> (no good) and chinese <mark>Chicken <mark>Shiitake <mark>Lobster Garlic Noodles</mark></mark></mark>.  maybe i was delusional to think that the <mark>Chicken <mark>Shiitake <mark>Lobster Garlic Noodles</mark></mark></mark> would come close to thanh long's.  \n\nall in all, if you want lots of beer variety and a good atmosphere, then this place is for you.  just don't expect them to excel in the food department.", 
            "i love this place! and once i heard they were opening one up in my neck of the woods (nor-cal), i jumped up and down with pitter pattering joy! \n\ntheir happy hour is well worth it. half off most of the appetizers. don't miss this one peeps!\n\nthe food is somewhat more than the average price but well worth it. about 15 dollars on average for an entree. \n\nour order: \n<mark>Coconut Shrimp</mark>: about 13 dollars for 4 large shrrrammmppss. yummy coconut crunchy goodness. 13 dollars worth? eh. i would have liked it a bit cheaper.\n<mark>Chicken <mark>Shiitake <mark>Lobster Garlic Noodles</mark></mark></mark>: not your average <mark>Chicken <mark>Shiitake <mark>Lobster Garlic Noodles</mark></mark></mark>. it was more buttery than garlicy. it's not what you taste in most chinese restaurants.\nsliders with <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>: decent. to me, they were just a bit average. but nonetheless, good.\n\nit's a bit dark inside. sets the mood. :op\n\nyardhouse, i like you. yes, i truly do.", 
            "i've been here a couple times before, but once i turned 21 this has been one of my go-to spots for happy hour because the specials are amazing! the fact that they have mini take home happy hour menus makes it all the more tempting as well. \n\nallow me break it down for you:\nhappy hour is mon-fri 3pm-6pm, sun-wed 10pm-close\n\ndomestic pints - $3.50, craft&import pints - $4.25-$4.75\nsliders served on a bed of fries  ($6.75): classic, bearnaise, pastrami, turkey, veggie. ahi is $9.95\n\nhalf priced pizzas: <mark><mark>Bbq Chicken</mark></mark>, 4cheese, ham & pineapple, margherita, pepperoni & mushroom, <mark>Spicy Thai Chicken</mark>\n\nhalf priced apps: <mark>Blue Crab Cakes</mark>, calamari, cali roll, chinese <mark>Chicken <mark>Shiitake <mark>Lobster Garlic Noodles</mark></mark></mark>, <mark>Chicken Nachos</mark>, <mark>Onion Ring Tower</mark>, wings, boneless wings, veggie wings, hawaiian <mark>Poke Stack</mark>, <mark>Spicy Tuna Roll</mark>, seared <mark>Ahi Sashimi </mark>, chicken <mark>Lettuce Wraps</mark>, <mark><mark>Gardein Fried Chicken Strips</mark></mark>, <mark>Spinach Cheese Dip</mark>, <mark>Moo Shu Egg Rolls</mark>\n\ndoesn't that just blow your mind? it's like a plethora of cheap happy hour eats and you'll probably get full off of one order of sliders, or 2 of their apps. \n\nso far i've tried:\n-bearnaise sliders (bearnaise sauce and fried shoestring onions on the patty w/ a side of very skinny fries that are tenderly cooked with a very light batter coating which gives them a perfectly crunchy exterior and \"juicy\" inside)\n-<mark><mark>Bbq Chicken</mark></mark> and <mark>Margherita Pizza</mark> (they pretty much taste as they should. sometimes the <mark><mark>Bbq Chicken</mark></mark> is a little too saucy for my taste though)\n-calamari (yum. perfectly fried on the outside and melting on the inside. served w/ marinara and, i wanna say tartar sauce? i usually go with the red..)\n-traditional wings (first and last time i had these, they were so spicy! my bf couldn't even handle them and he claims to love hot stuff, hehe. the thing that i don't like about these wings is that you can't choose how spicy you want them, so you have to be prepared for whatever they give you)\n\neverything i've tried has been pretty good so far and there is still so much more i have yet to try! i know my boyfriend has been having some sort of frenzy over the happy hour <mark>Poke Stack</mark>. he's gone to this location about 4 times in the past month, by himself, just to sit and eat the <mark>Poke Stack</mark>, so i can only guess how delicious it must be. \n\nkey points:\n-happy hour is awesome here\n-traditional wings are hot! (at least for me)\n-calamari is delectable\n-french fries are close to perfect\n-great for groups\n-service has been pretty fast on the days that i've gone", 
            "today me and fiance took my mom and step-dad to yard house today for lunch with our beautiful, perfect new baby girl.  we were at immediately, it wasn't too busy.  me and my fiance had been here many a times, we always have a good experience.  our waiter adam was great.  he was funny, informative, and a great suggestive seller.  all of us where very impressed! i run restaurants and i would hire adam in a hot second!  \ni had the <mark>Chicken <mark>Shiitake <mark>Lobster Garlic Noodles</mark></mark></mark>, as i always do and <mark>Grilled Cheese & <mark><mark><mark>Organic Tomato Bisque</mark></mark></mark></mark> soup.  my safe go to meal.  on the table we also had a roast beef sandwich; my mom loved it.  mac and cheesex2 which my fiance loves and gets from time to time.  the final dish was stacked chicken enchiladas, the looked great!! i was really impressed with the presentation.  there was also 2 bowls of <mark><mark><mark>Clam Chowder</mark></mark></mark> and 1 <mark><mark>French Onion</mark> Soup</mark> on the table, everything was gone by the end of the meal!.  \nadam checked on us many times, made small talk and joked with us through out the meal.  he gets 5 stars.  i would give the whole thing 5 stars but the beer we ordered was flat, or it was at the end of the keg. now not to brag but i know beer, its part of my job to know beer, even the beer tap systems. and it isn't the first time that has happened to me there.  any-who; adam did get us a different beer and it was fine.  we will be back, next time for happy hour, they have great deals!", 
            "we totally pigged out here!  a great alternative to vegas buffet.  the <mark>Chicken <mark>Shiitake <mark>Lobster Garlic Noodles</mark></mark></mark> are so yummy.  the <mark><mark>Bbq Chicken</mark></mark> pizza is not bad either.  even my preschooler found the food tasty.  the atmosphere is casual and everyone seemed to be having a good time.  it could be a bit loud, but worked out well since my kid was watching a video on the ipad.", 
            "when i found out that this place was a chain i was even more impressed. this place has the largest amount of beers on tap i have ever seen. they even had a northern california belgian that i love called brother thelonius on tap, which i thought was unheard of.\n\ni had the tuna poke for an app, basically it was tuna tartare, came mixed with avocado, it was very good. i also ordered the surf and turf burger. the lobster/burger combo was fantastic, it may not be the best burger i've ever had in my life but i would say it gets an honorable mention. i ordered mine with <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> that came with a maple bacon sauce, can't go wrong there. i also had a bite of the <mark>Chicken <mark>Shiitake <mark>Lobster Garlic Noodles</mark></mark></mark>, it was also great.", 
            "yelp challenge! started 8/20/2011 (15 of 365).\n\nmy usual order during happy hour goes something like this; don't worry, i share it with one other person!\n\n- <mark>Truffle Fries</mark>.  it's not on the happy hour list but it's only $4.  you can't go wrong with that considering truffle oil costs $20 a bottle!  these fries are bomb!\n\n-garlic noodes w/ shiitake mushrooms.  sounds simple but the dish is really flavorful.\n\n-sliders.  pastrami or classic.  you can never go wrong with these especially at 4 fairly sized sliders for $6.95 during happy hour!  they don't come in your natural hamburger bun, they come in sweet rolls; yum!  you can substitute your fries on this dish for more <mark>Truffle Fries</mark>.   that's how i do!\n\n-<mark>Ahi Sashimi </mark>.  this is good paired with the <mark>Chicken <mark>Shiitake <mark>Lobster Garlic Noodles</mark></mark></mark>.  \n\nsome other items to try of course are their pizzas.  they're all pretty good, pretty big, and half price during happy hour!  awesome.  \n\ni like sititng in the booths here because they are a perfect distance from the bar and tvs to watch the current sports games while you eat, plus its a good view to people watch.  sometimes it's nice to eat outside on their patio as well.  their brownie dessert is pretty good too if you have room for it! oh, and don't forget the beer.  they have a wide variety to choose from and you can have a whole yard size glass to yourself.  good luck with that!", 
            "yard house is by far my all time chain restaurant. how can you not love a place with a selection of pizzas, pastas, seafood, burgers, vegan, and gluten free!?! wait did i mention they also have sushi!?? the first time i went here i looked at my boyfriend and said, \"why have we not ate here before?\" he was as confused as me. however in the past 2 years i would say we have had our fair share of this place. \nwe have gone just us, we have taken my mom, and also taken the kids for a family event. \na couple of my favorite dishes include the jambalaya, the <mark>Chicken <mark>Shiitake <mark>Lobster Garlic Noodles</mark></mark></mark>, and the <mark>Spicy Tuna Roll</mark>. the jambalaya actually has a spice! i hate it when places skimp out on dishes that are suppose to burn a little. \nthe sushi rolls come as one big roll. a layer of rice, then a layer of fish, wasabi, tempura etc. the presentation is so nice you don't want to eat it. \nmy biggest issue when dining here is not getting a soup, salad, appetizer, main entree, and dessert. i suggest going with someone you don't ming sharing with because you will want to try theirs too! \nthe recently added a salted carmel butterscotch pudding. oh man, just put all my favs in one cup and serve it to me why don'tchya? \ndecent prices, good service, open late, caters to parties small and large. \nhow a good chain should be!",

            "big fan of yard house especially this location at town square, because it's a usual family friendly spot for happy hour where the parents can enjoy food and a few adult beverages and then walk it off at town square afterwards :)  yet it's also a cool spot to hang with co-workers or friends.  a good mix of either, yet when your their with the family you don't feel awkward because so many other people are having family nights out and then when you are there with adults only, you aren't bothered by all the kids around, which is pretty rare to find a place that can manage to do both at the same time.  maybe because it's a little dim and louder inside, but either way how the booths and tables are set up it's not too loud where you can't hear each other talk.\n\nhappy hour menu is one of the best i think in town.  a variety of good choices that aren't just appetizer size, but could be full meals, so getting a good amount for what you pay for. \n\n<mark>Chicken <mark>Shiitake <mark>Lobster Garlic Noodles</mark></mark></mark>, <mark>Poke Stack</mark>, sliders, onion stack and cheese pizza for the kids are our go-tos.  i have had items off the happy hour menu and those were delicious too.  i don't think i've ever had anything i don't like here.  recently had the mushroom <mark>Lettuce Wraps</mark> while doing the daniel fast and those were really good as well.\n\na good local go to spot for us, especially for family friday nights at town square :)",

(we come after we  perform in shows) \n\nlike i said i love the reverse happy hour menu so honestly that's the only things i've ever tried... and their dessert! yummy! my absolute favorite is the garlic <mark><mark>Chicken Noodle</mark></mark>!!! i see it more as a meal than an appetizer! lo mein type noodles <mark>Penne with Chicken</mark> chunks accompanied by garlic flavor, edamame seeds, parmesan cheese toppings, shiitake mushrooms, chunks of tofu, and sliced asparagus!!! who wouldn't love that?! it's absolutely delicious and just the right amount of garlic flavor. \n\nall of their happy hour appetizers are a must try. their half off pizzas are delicious, and my other favorite go to meal is the ahi-<mark>Poke Stack</mark>. perfectly lightly wasabi coated ahi tuna chunks stacked on wonton wafers accompanied with carrot and radish slices all lightly coated in the soy and wasabi ginger sauce with slices of fresh avocado on the side!!  \n\nwhen i order just the <mark>Chicken <mark>Shiitake <mark>Lobster Garlic Noodles</mark></mark></mark> and the <mark>Poke Stack</mark> during happy hour, with tip and tax included i walk out paying $15. can't beat that!!! \n\nnot to mention to amazing beer selection they have available!! pear cider is my go to! \n\ntry everything on their appetizer menu! i promise they do not disappoint",

            "not sure what's more embarrassing: the fact that the other day before going to see the master at rave (two thumbs up!) that i spent $120 on dinner for 2 at yard house, or the fact that i thought it was worth every penny.  this is not to say that the average opinion on the yardhouse is low, but i do think it's typically thought of as a place to grab some cheap happy hour appetizers and some beer and not a place to spend $30 on entrees.  well i did that, and i was damn happy with the results.\n\nwe arrived shortly before happy hour ended and i started with a black and tan and we also ordered the seared <mark>Ahi Sashimi </mark> appetizer which i was pleasantly surprised to find half off on the happy hour menu (which also discounted the price on the beer a bit).   i've had the ahi appetizer here several times and it's almost always a winner.  i'll venture to say it's the best of it's kind among chain restaurants.  for entrees my dining partner got the <mark>Pepper Crusted Filet</mark> mignon and i ordered the <mark>Ginger Crusted Norwegian Salmon</mark>.   both were accompanied with wasabi mashed potatoes which i've always enjoyed for that slight hint of wasabi in every bite.  my salmon was a little masked with all the toppings (namely carrot strings, the ginger crust, and the sesame vinaigrette).   usually i would find this to be a negative, but i''ll be damned if all of the ingredients really work together here.  i've been known to sneak a bite of the salmon on it's own from time to time anyhow and found it to be nicely cooked.\n\nthe one issue with the entire meal was the filet which was ordered medium was a little inconsistently cooked.  some of it seemed cooked medium well (little to no pink) while some of it did seem cooked as ordered.  i was able to taste a little of both sections and found them both tasty, though the one with some pink was more to my liking.  \n\nservice was great throughout and we ordered several jack and cokes once happy hour ended and they were constantly being refreshed.  when we informed the waitress we had a movie to make she made sure to bring the check to us quickly.  when the check first arrived i was slightly taken aback by the price (and the amount of alcohol we'd consumed), but realized it had been worth it.  it also made me appreciate that i could go into the yardhouse and make a choice on whether to have a great $30 experience of a couple of drinks, an <mark>Onion Ring Tower</mark> and a sandwich, or go all out and have a great steak or piece of fish for extra.  you can't do that (or much of anything else) at applebee's folks!  \n\nlater on in the theater while everyone else was fleeing for the exit midway through, we sat content.  i initially blamed this on poor movie taste by the others, but in retrospect perhaps it was the contentedness of the meal beforehand that transferred over to our cinema experience.", 
            "the yard house is always a go to restaurant when we have a bigger group, simply because they have a huge menu with a wide variety of choices. the apps are always tasty, my hubby loves the chicken wings and <mark>Lettuce Wraps</mark>, the <mark>Onion Ring Tower</mark> does not disappoint either, if you know what i mean. the <mark>Chicken Nachos</mark> are big enough to definitely share with a few people, and the shushimi is very good, as well. we've tried the burgers ( i like the <mark>Turkey Burger</mark> a lot), the <mark>Street Tacos</mark> are excellent, pasta dishes look good (although i haven't tried any yet) and the <mark>Pan Seared Ahi</mark> and <mark>Ginger Crusted Norwegian Salmon</mark> are tasty. there's a good kids menu, lots of beers to play around with, full bar. service has always been excellent and the atmosphere can be loud, but it's casual, too. we have eaten inside, but prefer outside. \nit's moderately priced for that type of restaurant, typically for our family of 4 the bill is $80-100, that's dinners with a beer or a cocktail."

            "fun place to go for drinks and good times with friends!  i agree that the happy hour from 3-6 pm is definitely pretty sweet.  can't go wrong with 1/2 on appetizers and drinks.  for appetizers, we tried the onion rings, <mark><mark>California Roll</mark></mark>, <mark><mark>Gardein Fried Chicken Strips</mark></mark>, <mark>Fried Calamari</mark>, <mark>Spicy Tuna Roll</mark>, and <mark>Blue Crab Cakes</mark>.  onion rings, <mark>Fried Calamari</mark>, and <mark>Blue Crab Cakes</mark> were all nice & crispy.  <mark><mark>Gardein Fried Chicken Strips</mark></mark> came with fries and were good as well, but nothing out of the ordinary.  the <mark><mark>California Roll</mark></mark> and <mark>Spicy Tuna Roll</mark> were interesting, in that their presentation was unlike that of those you see in a sushi restaurant.  they actually came as one huge, cut sushi piece, kind of like a cake or a tart.  the presentation was pretty unique, but the taste was also good but nothing really special.  if i was really craving sushi, i'd probably go check out normal sushi places like osaka, sushi club, or something along those lines.  for drinks, i've tried the mangolicious martini, the malibu peach martini, blue moon beer, and wyder's raspberry cider.  i'm usually not a huge beer drinker, but the wyder's was good...nice raspberry taste! of course, looove the martinis!  and to top it all off, we all shared a kona coffee ice cream sundae, which was to die for!!! i would definitely be hitting up yard house a lot for happy hour with different groups of friends in the future.", 
            "what a great, great last time out in vegas.\n\ni was invited to a get together with some work folks and was accompanied by the ultimate gentleman.  i have fond memories of many of their locations (costa mesa, irvine, long beach and west palm beach) and it was always with a crowd, so this is one of those chain places where good times are guaranteed.  \n\nwe went for happy hour since the appetizers were half priced and pints were 3.25.  the beer selection is huge and my companion and i had a hard time in choosing something to start with.  one of the two servers taking care of our table suggested we get a \"pre-designed\" sampler.  this is when the bar selects six beers for you, rather than you choosing six, and they stay within a certain medium, such as pale ales, darks, etc.  we wanted something in the medium category.  \n\nthe sampler is something i totally recommend you do if you're undecided about what beer you'd like and you have someone to share with you.  we sipped each beer, rated them accordingly, and decided our top three, in order, were redhook esb, redhook blond, and fat tire's new belgium.  since the top two were the new belgium and the blond, we ordered pints of each and shared 'em.\n\nas for the appetizers, we picked up an order of the <mark><mark>Gardein Fried Chicken Strips</mark></mark> and hawaiian <mark>Poke Stack</mark>.  great choices (kinda hard to mess up <mark><mark>Gardein Fried Chicken Strips</mark></mark>, though); the poke was a pretty good portion for an appetizer and was tasty!  \n\nboth of the servers were outstanding in tending to our party of 14.  very attentive, didn't miss a beat, and were great about reminding everyone to get their last orders in before happy hour ended.  can't beat that!\n\nif only the yard house were in the dmv.....", 
            "yardhouse is a nice, laid back restaurant with hundreds of beers to try, many on tap, and some great food.  the first time i tried this restaurant was a few years back, and i absolutely love it.\n\nif you love beer and some great food, you must try this place.  they serve fresh fish every day and it's cooked to order.  we always have the fresh fish when we eat dinner there.  lunch time is usually something else, like their mac n cheese squared or some sliders.  what i enjoy about this place is their variety of foods, from american to asian.  \n\nwant to save money and still eat well?  their appetizers could be a meal in itself!  they are huge portions and things like <mark><mark>Gardein Fried Chicken Strips</mark></mark> come with fries, anyway, so you can always order a beer and save money on the food. i really do love eating here and haven't tried everything on the menu yet.  i'm looking forward to more culinary adventures here soon!\n\nsome great tips: always ask your server about their favorite beers, or what beer they prefer from lagers, stouts, etc.  they are well versed in their beer and usually their preference is really good.  another thing--their portions are big, so if you're a small eater order one dish for 2 people.  seating can take awhile in the evenings, so coming in around 830/9pm may help seat you sooner.  if you want to eat dinner between 5-7 and you can't find parking, just use the valet right next to the restaurant side of town square.  it's open till the early morning and saves tons of time on finding that open space.", 
            "the cheesecake factory of beer and food. \n\ndinner is a little pricey so i like to come out more for the happy hour where you can get pizzas, wings, <mark><mark>Gardein Fried Chicken Strips</mark></mark>, etc.  it's probably a step up above kona in terms of the happy hour foods.\n\ni enjoy the beer flights so i can sample a little bit of everything.\n\none thing i don't like about the town square location (and this is probably true at all town square restaurants)  is that it is the dbc....dbc being douche bag central.....and the later u go, the more u will come across them.  no further explanation needed", 
            "boy is yard house pricey. good thing for the invention of happy hour. they hold theirs monday through friday from 4pm-6pm. my group got there at 4:45 and racked up most of the damage before hh ended, but the last few items boosted the check up by a third. \n\nthe well drinks run for four dollars and change, while the beers cost around four to six dollars. all the appetizers are half off and a great deal. if you are like me, a few of them makes for a better meal than any entree. \n\nwe got the <mark>Chicken Nachos</mark>, <mark><mark>Gardein Fried Chicken Strips</mark></mark>, <mark>Pan Seared Ahi</mark>, <mark>Classic Sliders</mark>, hummus, a pepperoni and mushroom pizza, and chicken wings. if you come during the designated time, then all of these except the hummus are half off. it is a great deal, but i would reconsider if it was at full price. they are generous with their portions. both the sliders and <mark><mark>Gardein Fried Chicken Strips</mark></mark> come in an order of four with fries. this was perfect because it matched the number of people at our table. both dishes would be worth it at the regular price. the ahi tuna was cooked nicely, but the sauce was too salty. it definitely did not need soy sauce, but i used up all the wasabi. the <mark>Chicken Nachos</mark> were nothing special. it is a generous portion, but the salsa looked more like marinara, the chicken was on the dry side, and the guacamole lacked the tang and spice. they were also bountiful with the wings. asking for them to be cooked extra crispy and having the sauce on the side guarantees for perfect wings. the hummus was packed with sodium and tasted a little bitter. the pizza came out quick, bubbling, and beautiful. too bad, i was too full by that time, but my friend liked it.  \n\nif you ever wanted to try a new beer, but afraid you might not like it, come for happy hour. at worst, you are out a few dollars. at best, you might meet your new best friend. \n\nanother thing worth mentioning, the staff were on their game tonight. it was not that busy, but our server was awesome. crystal was funny, sassy, and full of energy. \n\nthe only reason why i gave them three stars is because i worry about the amount of salt they use in all of their dishes. i know people complain about msg at chinese restaurant, but i drank five glasses of water while dining and am still guzzling it now. it was tasty, but my taste buds are on over drive and going nuts.", 
            "i have recently gone vegetarian and i find some sort of irony that this new diet is what has brought me to yardhouse in vegas for the first time. i have been to yardhouse before in a few other cities, but had a friend tell me last week about their vegetarian menu.\n\nthey use a meat substitute called gardein and it can be used in any of their dishes but they even have a section of the menu devoted to all of their vegetarian dishes. i decided to choose the chicken & veggie bowl with jasmine rice.. i expected it to be like a teriyaki sauce, but i have to admit that was my own assumption... in spite of not being sweet like i expected, it was a very delicious meal that i thoroughly enjoyed. my friend ordered the veggie <mark><mark>Gardein Fried Chicken Strips</mark></mark> with a side of <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>. of course i had to try this and i have to admit i would have loved to have ordered those too...\n\ni think this is going to be another one of my new spots to frequent as it can totally fit into my diet and keep others around me happy too...\n\nyay!!!\n\nps: can someone tell me why this isn't classified under vegetarian?? i would have found it a lot sooner...", 
            "i've been here a couple times before, but once i turned 21 this has been one of my go-to spots for happy hour because the specials are amazing! the fact that they have mini take home happy hour menus makes it all the more tempting as well. \n\nallow me break it down for you:\nhappy hour is mon-fri 3pm-6pm, sun-wed 10pm-close\n\ndomestic pints - $3.50, craft&import pints - $4.25-$4.75\nsliders served on a bed of fries  ($6.75): classic, bearnaise, pastrami, turkey, veggie. ahi is $9.95\n\nhalf priced pizzas: <mark><mark>Bbq Chicken</mark></mark>, 4cheese, ham & pineapple, margherita, pepperoni & mushroom, <mark>Spicy Thai Chicken</mark>\n\nhalf priced apps: <mark>Blue Crab Cakes</mark>, calamari, cali roll, chinese <mark>Chicken <mark>Shiitake <mark>Lobster Garlic Noodles</mark></mark></mark>, <mark>Chicken Nachos</mark>, <mark>Onion Ring Tower</mark>, wings, boneless wings, veggie wings, hawaiian <mark>Poke Stack</mark>, <mark>Spicy Tuna Roll</mark>, seared <mark>Ahi Sashimi </mark>, chicken <mark>Lettuce Wraps</mark>, <mark><mark>Gardein Fried Chicken Strips</mark></mark>, <mark>Spinach Cheese Dip</mark>, <mark>Moo Shu Egg Rolls</mark>\n\ndoesn't that just blow your mind? it's like a plethora of cheap happy hour eats and you'll probably get full off of one order of sliders, or 2 of their apps. \n\nso far i've tried:\n-bearnaise sliders (bearnaise sauce and fried shoestring onions on the patty w/ a side of very skinny fries that are tenderly cooked with a very light batter coating which gives them a perfectly crunchy exterior and \"juicy\" inside)\n-<mark><mark>Bbq Chicken</mark></mark> and <mark>Margherita Pizza</mark> (they pretty much taste as they should. sometimes the <mark><mark>Bbq Chicken</mark></mark> is a little too saucy for my taste though)\n-calamari (yum. perfectly fried on the outside and melting on the inside. served w/ marinara and, i wanna say tartar sauce? i usually go with the red..)\n-traditional wings (first and last time i had these, they were so spicy! my bf couldn't even handle them and he claims to love hot stuff, hehe. the thing that i don't like about these wings is that you can't choose how spicy you want them, so you have to be prepared for whatever they give you)\n\neverything i've tried has been pretty good so far and there is still so much more i have yet to try! i know my boyfriend has been having some sort of frenzy over the happy hour <mark>Poke Stack</mark>. he's gone to this location about 4 times in the past month, by himself, just to sit and eat the <mark>Poke Stack</mark>, so i can only guess how delicious it must be. \n\nkey points:\n-happy hour is awesome here\n-traditional wings are hot! (at least for me)\n-calamari is delectable\n-french fries are close to perfect\n-great for groups\n-service has been pretty fast on the days that i've gone", 
            "visit on 1/21/12\n\nnormally i experience a 4 at the yard house but this experience was a 2 at best...i'm giving them a 3 for benefit of the doubt.  service was s  l  oooooooooow... it was semi-busy but we have been there at busier times.  we started with the onion rings-tasty as usual.  my husband ordered the <mark>Grilled Pastrami</mark> which he said was very good.  i had the <mark>Spicy Thai Chicken</mark> noodle salad.  there was a generous serving of perfectly grilled <mark><mark>Gardein Fried Chicken Strips</mark></mark> on the salad.  the noodles were slightly tough but otherwise a tasty dish.\n\nthe music was extremely loud during our visit.  we gave up on talking.  getting our check took at least 10 minutes until my husband had to ask another passing waiter.", 
            "surprisingly good food all around. i got to try a lot of things, including a blue crab cake hoagie with house <mark><mark>Classic Ranch Salad</mark></mark> (lunch menu), <mark>Chicken Nachos</mark>, <mark>Onion Ring Tower</mark>, <mark>Fried Calamari</mark>, and <mark><mark>Gardein Fried Chicken Strips</mark></mark> w/ fries (disclaimer: didn't double-check the menu, so not all names of food items may be accurate). for some reason, out of all of those, i found myself munching on the fries and dipping them on the honey mustard that accompanied the chicken. i guess the fries were just in the sweet spot of crunchiness and fluffiness, and the honey mustard was way too addictive. i can't speak for the beer, but everybody at my table seemed to enjoy theirs and they have a huge selection. finally,  gotta love a place that plays some beatles and some george harrison.\n\ni also wanted to add a tip for finding this place. gotta locate it before you can enjoy it, you know? it's kinda hidden if you're driving along most of the streets, so locate it on a map of town square beforehand or else just park somewhere and walk around. i think it might be best if you park near h&m and take the alley that starts off with the sushi bar and yogurtland, then walk past the \"clearing\" in the middle. you should see it on the right.", 
            "good atmosphere. might see a local celeb. great <mark><mark>Gardein Fried Chicken Strips</mark></mark> and beer selection. try the rasberry lambic blend beer. mmmm"

            "the first time coming here, i was pretty impressed that they had a vegetarian menu. that was already a plus for me. i came here with family that had come into town and almost all of us ordered vegetarian. we had hummus and pita, <mark>Truffle Fries</mark>, <mark><mark>Deviled Eggs</mark></mark>,the gardein <mark><mark>Gardein Orange Peel Chicken</mark></mark>, the gardein <mark>Penne with Chicken</mark>, and  hongos y rajas tacos. they were all really good. i was impressed. many places that offer vegetarian dishes mess them up by adding too much of something, whether it's tofu or vegetables. in this case, the gardein products were utilized perfectly. for dessert, we had a mini creme brulee, a mini peach apple <mark>Cobb</mark>, and a mini lemon souffle. this entire meal was demolished by my family. the only reason i gave it 4 stars is because i ordered root beer thinking that a place that makes their own beer would make their own homeade root beer and cream soda. sadly, they only had barq's root beer. what a disappointment! i will definitely come back and enjoy more selections next time.\n\n\nthat was my last review.\n\nhere's an update. last time i went to yardhouse, i ordered vegetarian jerk wings. they were pretty good until i realized the wings were definitely not vegetarian. that is a mistake a restaurant should never make. luckily, i'm not a customer who likes to cause problems since i work in the industry but i was shocked that happened. for that, i demoted yardhouse.", 
            "i love yard house. there atmosphere, the snooty bartenders, the great food and delicious drinks.. what's not to love. \n\nthey have a bunch of vegetarian options here! it's amazing. veggie \"beef\" sliders.. \"chicken\" <mark>Chicken <mark>Shrimp <mark><mark>Gardein Orange Peel Chicken</mark> Rice Bowl</mark></mark></mark>.. spicy \"chicken\" sandwich.. (that's what i got.. mostly because i've always wanted to say \"can i get the <mark>Spicy Thai Chicken</mark> sandwich please?\" i've never been able to say that before!). its the gardein substitute for meat, a gluten-free, soy-based protein that is supposed to duplicate the flavor/taste/texture of meat. i thought it was delish. moist and very filling. the aioli was great too. don't be afraid of the cabbage (i was, i hate cabbage). it's a thin layer, quite sparse and the other flavors conceal the cabbage anyway. i'm not sure if this is a nv thing or a new feature at the chain, bc the last one i went to in so cal didn't have that many veggie options (they had the regular amount, just not a half of a page in the menu dedicated to soy protein (fake meat) dishes!!\n\ni'd love to give them 5 stars, i really wanted to. the staff was friendly, they called when the order was ready (i picked up), they even had the water i requested all ready to go... but the <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> weren't cooked all the way through. not all of them, at least. as a giant fan of <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>, that is disappointing. it means enough to knock off a star even though yh knocked my socks off with the veggie menu. so stoked about that!", 
            "yardhouse's  customer service is on point. they had messed up my order and the manager kindly went up to my table and apologized. the food was great as always! we started with the lobster <mark>Lobster, Crab & Artichoke Dip</mark>. there were way too many chips and pitts for a small dip size. the dip was tasty. we had the macaroni and cheese with <mark>Gardein Orange Peel Chicken</mark> with truffle sauce so yummy! my favorite! \n\nour only disappointment was that my bf's burger didn't have a bearnaise sauce.  and on the menu it says bernaise burger. it was just a reg burger he got. he was hungry so he just ate it. we didn't even tell our waiter.",

            "enjoyed my time here a lot. it's a cozy large restaurant with booth and table seating. i arrived here with my sister on a stifling hot monday afternoon. we were quickly seated at a table and greeted about five minutes later by our server seth, who brought out our hibiscus tea and water. he was efficient and friendly and made great menu recommendations. we don't eat much at one sitting so we went straight in and my sister ordered their <mark>Classic Cheese</mark> burger with fries and i ordered the <mark>Shrimp <mark><mark>Gardein Orange Peel Chicken</mark> Rice Bowl</mark></mark> with rice. one thing i noticed was their drink selection was enormous. drafts, cocktails, mixed drinks and margaritas you name it they know it. looked like a great happy hour spot if only we could've came at 10 pm. but it was ok, once our food came out i was very happy with my choice as i love veggies with my food and this place did a <mark>Chicken <mark>Shrimp <mark><mark>Gardein Orange Peel Chicken</mark> Rice Bowl</mark></mark></mark> with veggies and shrimp perfectly. since we were pressed for time we did not stay long but overall satisfied with the experience, i recommend going for happy hour on the weekdays so your server isn't rushed because i got that vibe a few times from the look of the servers there. would go for happy hour!",

            "pros:\n* delicious food. you have to try the <mark><mark>Gardein Blackened Chicken Torta</mark></mark> soup.\n* friendly staff.\n* modern menu and decor.\n\ncons:\n* expensive. the food while good is slightly too expensive.\n* due to the popularity, they're generally crowded with long waits.\n\ni believe town square to be the best shopping and restaurant plaza in las vegas. the quantity of choices for either is only matched by the quality. there certainly is no shortage of great food at town square and on yelp, yard house is rated best of them all. i haven't tried them all but i can definitely say yard house is the best i've had yet.\n\ni went with a group of four on a late tuesday afternoon. they weren't busy or crowded but i have seen the line pour out the door enough times to know i was lucky. we were promptly sat down just time to enjoy the happy hour menu. we ordered their famous tower of onion rings while we sifted through the massive menu. i ordered the <mark>Gardein Bbq Chicken Salad</mark> with a cup of <mark>Grilled Cheese & <mark><mark><mark>Organic Tomato Bisque</mark></mark></mark></mark> soup. the other members of my party ordered the barbeque <mark>Gardein Bbq Chicken Salad</mark> with a cup of <mark><mark>Gardein Blackened Chicken Torta</mark></mark> soup, pastrami sandwich, and a mushroom burger. \n\nwhen the <mark>Onion Ring Tower</mark> arrived it instantly lived up to the expectations. thin, lightly battered, crispy onion rings sprinkled with parmesan cheese and served with ranch and chipotle ranch. they bursted with flavor to die for. at first the tower seems so incredibly large but when you finish the memory feels small in hindsight. my soup and salad was good with a pleasant, creamy, rich ranch dressing and well-seasoned <mark>Grilled Cheese & <mark><mark><mark>Organic Tomato Bisque</mark></mark></mark></mark> soup. however, it paled in comparison to the nothing short of perfect, <mark><mark>Gardein Blackened Chicken Torta</mark></mark> soup. i have never had a <mark>Chicken Tortilla Soup</mark> so creamy and flavorful. they put a large piece of avocado in the cup along with the crispy tortilla strips and large chunks of chicken. together, they blend to create a truly wonderful and hearty cup of soup. i had a bite of the barbeque <mark>Gardein Bbq Chicken Salad</mark> and while it was a bit too saucy for my tastes, the barbeque dressing wasn't overpowering and went well with the large pile of onion strings atop the salad. the pastrami sandwich looked great and the burger looked even better. the burger bun instantly caught my eye with a smooth crisp surface devoid of any grease or sheen. next time i will surely try a burger. \n\nthe town square location is large and wide open. the lighting is dim and creates a hip vibe that went well with the modern menu. everyone in my group had a few questions about the menu and the server was friendly, knowledgeable, and willing to help. the prices however are a bit steep and you might want to arrive early to take advantage of the happy hour choices. one specific item that caught my eye was the 17 dollar macaroni and cheese. it looked delicious but it would have to be at that price.\n\nin the end i walked away satisfied and yearning to return to try a burger or maybe even that posh mac and cheese entree.", 
            "no matter what i order here it is always always delicious! they have the best <mark><mark>Gardein Blackened Chicken Torta</mark></mark> soup!!! i also love their pineapple cider, so refreshing! it's expensive so i only come here in special occasions!",

            "this is one of the new millions of beers on tap concept restaurants. the food was great, the staff friendly and professional and the atmosphere smart casual. i had the shrimp cobb salad that was fresh and tasty, and i appreciated the availability of a half portion so i could try the soup. the <mark><mark>Gardein Blackened Chicken Torta</mark></mark> soup, is a must try. this is a good solid classy bar with something for everyone."

            "pros:\n* delicious food. you have to try the <mark><mark>Gardein Blackened Chicken Torta</mark></mark> soup.\n* friendly staff.\n* modern menu and decor.\n\ncons:\n* expensive. the food while good is slightly too expensive.\n* due to the popularity, they're generally crowded with long waits.\n\ni believe town square to be the best shopping and restaurant plaza in las vegas. the quantity of choices for either is only matched by the quality. there certainly is no shortage of great food at town square and on yelp, yard house is rated best of them all. i haven't tried them all but i can definitely say yard house is the best i've had yet.\n\ni went with a group of four on a late tuesday afternoon. they weren't busy or crowded but i have seen the line pour out the door enough times to know i was lucky. we were promptly sat down just time to enjoy the happy hour menu. we ordered their famous tower of onion rings while we sifted through the massive menu. i ordered the <mark>Gardein Bbq Chicken Salad</mark> with a cup of <mark>Grilled Cheese & <mark><mark><mark>Organic Tomato Bisque</mark></mark></mark></mark> soup. the other members of my party ordered the barbeque <mark>Gardein Bbq Chicken Salad</mark> with a cup of <mark><mark>Gardein Blackened Chicken Torta</mark></mark> soup, pastrami sandwich, and a mushroom burger. \n\nwhen the <mark>Onion Ring Tower</mark> arrived it instantly lived up to the expectations. thin, lightly battered, crispy onion rings sprinkled with parmesan cheese and served with ranch and chipotle ranch. they bursted with flavor to die for. at first the tower seems so incredibly large but when you finish the memory feels small in hindsight. my soup and salad was good with a pleasant, creamy, rich ranch dressing and well-seasoned <mark>Grilled Cheese & <mark><mark><mark>Organic Tomato Bisque</mark></mark></mark></mark> soup. however, it paled in comparison to the nothing short of perfect, <mark><mark>Gardein Blackened Chicken Torta</mark></mark> soup. i have never had a <mark>Chicken Tortilla Soup</mark> so creamy and flavorful. they put a large piece of avocado in the cup along with the crispy tortilla strips and large chunks of chicken. together, they blend to create a truly wonderful and hearty cup of soup. i had a bite of the barbeque <mark>Gardein Bbq Chicken Salad</mark> and while it was a bit too saucy for my tastes, the barbeque dressing wasn't overpowering and went well with the large pile of onion strings atop the salad. the pastrami sandwich looked great and the burger looked even better. the burger bun instantly caught my eye with a smooth crisp surface devoid of any grease or sheen. next time i will surely try a burger. \n\nthe town square location is large and wide open. the lighting is dim and creates a hip vibe that went well with the modern menu. everyone in my group had a few questions about the menu and the server was friendly, knowledgeable, and willing to help. the prices however are a bit steep and you might want to arrive early to take advantage of the happy hour choices. one specific item that caught my eye was the 17 dollar macaroni and cheese. it looked delicious but it would have to be at that price.\n\nin the end i walked away satisfied and yearning to return to try a burger or maybe even that posh mac and cheese entree.", 
            "i'm baaaaack. we gave yardhouse another try and our experience was definitely better - but the santana row location will always be home. \n\nwe decided to come for lunch and since the weather was beautiful we decided to sit outside. i have no idea why yardhouse does this but they sit people when their servers are at lunch. the logic makes no sense to me because how is there supposed to be service at a table when the server assigned to it is off the clock. right? i'm not sure either. this happened last time and it happened again. thankfully the server wasn't on lunch for a godly amount of time and we were actually able to get our order in in a timely manner.\n\nthe food seems really consistent location to location and you can't get me away from their french fries or  bbq ranch <mark>Gardein Bbq Chicken Salad</mark> but seating your customers in an area that won't get any service needs to change. until then, this place is still just \"ok\"", 
            "one of my favorite restaurants of all time! this is one of the places where pretty much anything that you order will be delicious! they also carry my favorite beer: the house belgian amber triple! delicious if you like a darker brew with a soft after taste. i highly recommend the <mark>Gardein Bbq Chicken Salad</mark> and their garlic fries! mmmm! i probably go here once a week!", 
            "after golf with my husband on our anniversary we went to yard house for a bite. the hostess ask if were just playing tennis and we said golf for our anniversary.  i ordered the cobb with salmon \"amazing\" and my husband loves the <mark>Gardein Bbq Chicken Salad</mark>. we didn't know the hostess told our waitress kristyn about our anniversary and she took the initiative to surprise us with dessert plates. she even got the desserts correct chocolate for him and fruit for me."

            "yeah, i'll throw my 2 cents in...\ni was here on a saturday evening around 7 pm and it was packed. 40 minute wait for a table for 2, not terrible but i should have made reservations.\ngot right up to the bar and after glancing at a line of drafts 30 foot long, i ordered something i was familiar with because there was no way i was going to try and look at each one and look like a complete tool...anyway the bar service was fast.\nwe ended up getting sat outside, which we didn't ask for but hey, i was starving so we sat, ordered and food got there in decent time. i ordered the <mark><mark>Roast Beef Dip</mark></mark> and is was phenomenal. i got the salad instead of fries and it was actually pretty good. i was expecting iceburg lettuce with an under ripe cherry tomato but it was much better than that.\nall in all, i'd go back just to sample the beer and grab that <mark><mark>Roast Beef Dip</mark></mark> again. i take a star off because it felt too touristy for me...i'm more of a locals only dude", 
            "my first time at the yard house wasn't really anything special, but i can see why people would like it. the ambiance is cozy for sports enthusiasts and beer connoissers.  they have about 150 different beers on tap which is impressive. i sat at the bar and had one of the beers on tap. after looking thru their extensive beer menu, i ordered the sin city light; it was good. it's about $6 for a beer. so for the most part, the bar is what makes the place; along with all the flat screen tvs mounted throughout.\n\nas a restaurant...they need a lot of work. i ordered the <mark><mark>Roast Beef Dip</mark></mark>. a simple dish (it's a sandwich for crying out loud), how can anyone get that wrong...au jus was too salty. that's what makes the sandwich! also, they need to melt the provolone in the sandwich. they just slapped on a cold piece of cheese! one of my friends had the porter house steak. she had ordered it medium, but she realized as she was cutting into the steak that it was a little on the rare side. once she pointed that out to our non-attentive waiter, he did take the steak back and correct it. the manager even brought it back out to her and apologized for that and did not charge for her entree. that was nice of him... my cousin had the <mark>Lettuce Wraps</mark>. i didn't try them, but he says that the wraps were really good. my brother had the ahi salad. he liked it. the prices on their food menu are comparable to that of a chilis or chevy's.\n\nnow about our waiter...seems like he was trying to avoid us the whole time we were there. the sad thing is that he was also training someone on the floor that night; what a good example he is setting for the trainee! we had to wave him down a couple of times for drinks and a couple times for condiments. come to think of it, we didn't even get place settings until after our food arrived. we had to ask another waiter for that! he only came by to check on us once, and that was the same time he slapped us the bill.", 
            "soooooo tasty!!! we decided to get off the strip with a local friend who suggested the yardhouse. i've tried the one in san diego which is ok so i didn't have high expectations, especially since this one is in a big mall. well, the food and service were excellent. we had a couple of salads, the lettuce cups, <mark>Ahi Sashimi </mark>, mac n cheese and the <mark><mark>Roast Beef Dip</mark></mark>. all excellent, but that shashimi won over 2 non-raw-fish eaters at the table. it was really outstanding. we will definitely be eating here when we're in vegas again!!", 
            "amazing food as always, great service, had the <mark><mark>Roast Beef Dip</mark></mark>.", 
            "we went for lunch on a sunday afternoon for my friend's birthday.  i've never been to a yard house.  they were located  on las vegas blvd at town square in las vegas.\n\nwe shared an order of <mark>Fried Calamari</mark>.  it came with tartar and spicy tomato sauce.  there was a good amount of tentacles and body breaded in a heavy cornmeal breading.\n\nmy friend ordered the half order of <mark>Ahi Crunchy </mark> salad which had 4 pieces of seared rare ahi, <mark><mark>Mixed Field Greens</mark></mark>, asian slaw and crispy wontons tossed in soy vinaigrette.  the full order had 6 pieces of seared rare ahi and more <mark><mark>Mixed Field Greens</mark></mark>.\n\nmy other friend ordered the lunch portion of <mark>Gardein Bbq <mark>Gardein Spicy Thai <mark>Bbq Chicken Pizza</mark></mark></mark> and a <mark>Classic Ranch</mark> salad.  the salad was just iceberg lettuce with shredded carrots, cucumber, and tomatoes.\n\ni ordered the lunch portion of half a <mark><mark>Roast Beef Dip</mark></mark> and a cup of <mark><mark><mark>Clam Chowder</mark></mark></mark>.\nthere was not a spoon on the plate, so i had to track down our server.  the <mark><mark>Roast Beef Dip</mark></mark> was tender and the creamy horseradish was really good.  next time i would order a whole <mark><mark>Roast Beef Dip</mark></mark> which comes with fries.  i had also ordered a side of french fries.  they were warm, not freshly fried.\n\nthe server brought out a complimentary mini lemon souffle with fresh raspberries and house made whipped cream with a candle for my friend's birthday.  it was very light.\n\ni will be back.", 
            "really good food and service. the list of beers is phenomenal. you won't have any problem trying to pair a beer with your meal because the have everything covered. imports, domestics, crafts,  dark, light, amber they have it all. the only issue is having to restrain yourself from ordering all of them lol. all beer is on draught which is amazing. the food is really bomb too. i ordered a <mark><mark>Roast Beef Dip</mark></mark> sandwich which was really good. also tried the <mark>Lobster, Crab & Artichoke Dip</mark> and that was also good. would defintiely come back to take a date. prices are reasonable and a good happy hour.", 
            "stopped in for dinner with my daughter after shopping. the wait was relatively short considering how busy it was. we were seated at a table in a high traffic area. it was extremely noisy, not sure if that's normal for this place but it makes it difficult to have a conversation. we had to request silverware settings when our meal came so we had something to eat with as apparently no one recognized we didn't have any. my daughter ordered a club sandwich and was surprised that the cheese wasn't even melted. my <mark><mark>Roast Beef Dip</mark></mark> was nasty. the bun was just barely bigger than a hotdog bun, it was completely soggy on the bottom and the meat was luke warm at best and lacked flavor. i ended up just sending it back. most likely wont be going back to this restaurant any time soon.", 
            "the service was great considering how busy it was hence the 1 star i give this place. the food was 0 stars. other than that, i would have given this place no stars. i ordered the <mark>Angel Hair Pasta</mark>, my bf ordered the dip with a side of <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> and our friend ordered a grilled chicken sandwhich with broccoli. when all of our orders came out, i tried the fries and they were cold. i mentioned it to my boyfriend and when he touched his sandwhich, it was also cold. i thought that was a bit weird, but when my friend took a bite if his sandwhich he said his chicken was also cold. i was thinking, maybe because it's a sandwhich, it wouldn't be that warm even though my bf ordered the <mark><mark>Roast Beef Dip</mark></mark>. so, i took a bite of my pasta and my pasta was dry, bland, and cold. it seemed like they left it out for a long time because the pasta was kind of stale. it was by far the worst meal i have eaten. no one in my party enjoyed their cold food. the food is over priced and they serve cold food. what i did notice yesterday night because i was sitting in front of the kitchen, was the food was coming out fast, but the food was standing there forever. i saw 4 dishes waiting there to be picked up for roughly 10 min. no wonder the food was getting cold! not enough runners to even bring the food out. horrible way to manage a business that can't have enough staff to bring out orders. i will never return here for the food. like a huge company like this, they should have already gotten their shit together. horrible.", 
            "come here pretty often! the <mark>Truffle Fries</mark> are the best <mark>Truffle Fries</mark> on the planet!! they have happy hour monday-friday 3-6pm, and their deals are pretty good. they also have their lunch selections daily from 11am-5pm, where you get to pick a soup or salad and a pizza or sandwich and all are awesome! their <mark><mark>Roast Beef Dip</mark></mark> is not the best and i am not a fan of their pizzas, but their appetizers are great( especially the <mark>Onion Ring Tower</mark>)! usually get the hofbr\\u00e4u hefe weizen but the server convinced me to try the timmermans strawberry and !! the servers are really knowledgeable about their beers (since they have about 180 different kinds!) so they really help you pick one that's perfect for your taste!! at this specific location the servers vary with their personalities, so depending on who you get can absolutely influence your time there.", 
            "this place redefines what to expect for bar food. the first time my boss suggested this spot for a work lunch i was disappointed. vegas has so many great options. why would i want to eat bar food? i was wrong because the food is good, not just average bar food.\n\nthe lunch specials are very tasty and accommodate a lunch hour at a reasonable price. my favorite combination is the 1/2 <mark><mark>Roast Beef Dip</mark></mark> with a salad. diet splurge meets healthy. my favorite appetizers are the onion rings and <mark>Chicken Nachos</mark>. when we come here for work dinners the mac & cheese with truffle oil is a favorite for several of my coworkers. the burgers are also really good, loaded with toppings and very juicy.\n\nthe menu is huge and has something to accommodate all tastes. great spot to take a picky friend. this is obviously a great spot for beer lovers since they have so many beers on tap.\n\nthis particular location has a lot of outdoor seating which is a great option on a nice day. the patio is in the center of the shopping center for plenty of people watching entertainment."

            "after and independent of a uye, when i join my yelp friends for socializing at the yard house, it becomes the yelp house. the yard house is a fun place for groups of friends to hang out over beer and good food. the restaurant does a commendable job accommodating large groups. both times that i went to the yard house we had no problem getting a large table. the service is precise. and when it is time to pay, we had our own checks. substitute yelpers for a gathering of general friends, or a date and the yard house is everybody's social house.\n\n  the yard house is my choice chain restaurant for beer selection. the yard house is to beer what baskin robbins is to ice cream. whereas baskin robbins features 31 flavors of ice cream,, the yard house features approximately 600 flavors of beer (i counted the beer listed in the menu). if i were to go to the yard house one friday a week to order a flavor of beer, according to my math it would take me 12 years to done this. or if i were to go to the yard house everyday to try a flavor of beer, it would take me 2 years to do this. some of the beers may have been listed under a couple of different headings. the deal is that the yard house selection of beer is as good as it gets. \n\n  there are eleven series of beer. there is the chalkboard series. the cider series is the seasonals. the light beer is less than 5.8% alcohol content. this series includes many of the name brands such as michelob and budweiser. there is the honey fruit series which includes bbc strawberry blonde and blue point blueberry. there is the wheat series that includes blue hawaiin hefeweizen. the malty series includes bass ale and alaskin amber. the dark series includes big sky moose drool and bison organic chocolate. the bitter series includes anchor liberty and blue point hoptical illusion. and there is the strong and effervescent series. the menu lists the alcohol content. unless i overlooked something, the allagash curieux is the strongest at 11% alcohol content. there are three sizes of beer. i went for the middle size which is the pint. for the record i greatly appreciated the firestone.\n\n  this very yard house features a happy hour and late night specials. the happy hour is monday-friday 3-6 pm and late night special sunday-wednesday 10-close. they include domestic pints from $4.25-$5.75, well drinks $4.27-$4.75 and wine by glass $2 off. if you are up to food there are half price appetizers & pizza.\n\n  the food is good but i've tasted better. my complaint about the <mark><mark>Roasted Turkey Club</mark></mark> is that it was layers of sandwich instead of the sandwich i am accustomed to. the <mark>Classic Cheese</mark> was a good choice. the fries are these skinny things that remind me of potato sticks. i feel that the yard house ought to expand their fries selection to include steak fries and just thicker fries.\n\n  when i socialize at a restaurant, i am big on the music that is playing. i was won over by the music playing. i heard great music from led zeppelin, the rolling stones and classic rock era.\n\n  the yard house excells at their selection of beer. whether it is my yelp house or social house i intend to return. when i return i plan to try the blue point blueberry beer that is brewed in blue point, ny; 5 miles south of where i lived. gotta be patriotic to my home town.\n\ndaniel. s yelp 100 challenge. review 72", 
            "i won't lie. i had the lowest expectations of yard house after having been to so many lackluster ones. luckily for vegas, this one is a winner, winner. now all i'm missing is a chicken dinner.\n\nbut there's a lot more to be had. like all yard house menus, the variety spans from americana to asian in one giant menu. it's like cheesecake factory, but pricier and vastly higher quality. if there is a place to enjoy a killer selection of beer, while ordering everything from hawaiian poke to korean kalbi to <mark>Shrimp Ceviche </mark>, let it be here.\n\nas a venue, this yard house is stacked. a robust wait staff, plenty of seating all around, with tvs lining the ceilings and corners and game audio for a crowded monday night football viewing. who ever said this side of vegas (town square) was boring? certainly not i.\n\nmy hungry and tired of group of frenzy eaters ordered a plethora of random stuff, just as their menu intended:\n\nchicken <mark>Lettuce Wraps</mark> ($12)\n<mark>Kung Pao Calamari</mark> ($11)\nseared <mark>Ahi Sashimi </mark> ($14)\nboneless wings ($13)\nhawaiian <mark>Poke Stack</mark> ($14)\n<mark><mark>Roasted Turkey Club</mark></mark> ($11)\n<mark>Spicy Tuna Roll</mark> ($13)\n\nall in all, everything was decent. the chicken <mark>Lettuce Wraps</mark> were fresh, tasty, and abundant. wasn't the biggest fan of the <mark>Kung Pao Calamari</mark>, but folks looking for a different take on fried squid ought to try it once. while the <mark><mark>Roasted Turkey Club</mark></mark>, boneless wings, and <mark>Spicy Tuna Roll</mark> (which looked like mofongo!) were somewhere in the middle, the <mark>Pan Seared Ahi</mark> and <mark>Poke Stack</mark> were the surprising winners of the night. extra surprising that it tasted like fresh fish all while in the middle of the desert? most definitely.\n\nwhile i'm not one to frequent chains, i can see myself coming back to this yard house with beer loving, sports seeking, hungry, good company. lastly, it's a solid spot that is  within 2 minutes away from mccarran international airport."

            "pop quiz: how sad is it that eating at this yard house was one of my most anticipated moments before getting on the plane and heading out to las vegas for a few days? gambling, glitz, girls and other words that start with \"g\" are all fine and dandy, but sometimes a guy just wants to down a few beers, chomp on some outstanding food and unwind in a place where not everyone is a raging tourist carrying an over-sized plastic drink that is watered down and reeks of desperation. this is that place.\n\nmy folks and i actually made it over here before they opened on a monday morning and people were already lined up at 10:50 a.m. that's cool, right? this place clearly has a faithful audience, as evidenced by this review. and once those doors opened, shoot: it's like the customers in line thought the first 10 people in the door got a free unicorn that performs karaoke exclusively to hair metal songs. they rushed the door with a fervent desire to be first in and we just sort of meandered in after them. it's a big place with plenty of seats - there's no point in scrambling over each other to be the first one in. there's a lengthy patio, a surrounded bar and more seating than the average bar would know what to do with.\n\na hostess guided us to a booth opposite a table of nine individuals who exemplified the \"money cannot buy class\" rule. we overheard them tell the waitress they had to be out of there to catch a movie so right away you could tell this had potential to be the table from hell. we already felt for this gal and then we realized she was waiting on us, too! let it be known that tasha, our waitress, got the mvp award for eternity during this shift because when the place opened, it appeared she got triple sat right out of the gate. now i'm not an expert in the service industry but i know how hard it is to recover from a hand dealt like that in the opening minutes. we assured her we were in no rush, mostly because we weren't, and partly because we did not want to witness a breakdown on the floor. to her credit, she kept her cool and was efficient as she was sassy.\n\nspeaking of keeping cool, you might want to psych yourself up before eating here because the menu is positively dickensian with its verbiage. six pages of beer alone?! no, you have not died and gone to heaven; you just happened to wander into a place thriving with variety. being that we stopped in for lunch, we stuck with sandwiches and the must-have lunch combo: a cup of soup and half a sandwich/pizza. mom's <mark>Grilled Chicken & Avocado</mark> sandwich was polished off with ease, dad's... whatever dad ate, was equally delicious, and my <mark>Chicken Tortilla Soup</mark> and <mark>Pepperoni Pizza</mark> were wolfed down in a shameful display almost as noticeable as my preference for hopping around the beer menu: big sky moose drool can totally give way to kronenbourg 1664 if you try.\n\nand through it all tasha managed the suffocating requests of her demanding table, a performance that would go unnoticed if you were not paying attention given that everyone working here is a study in quick service and attentiveness. food runners actually running food? hostesses navigating the dining room with purpose? bartenders keeping their orders flowing? you'd better believe it. we did not see a manager but i am assuming one was on duty, probably sitting in the rafters like batman/woman, waiting to pounce when the need makes itself known.\n\nthere was one last bit of unfinished business: dessert. i'll just say this now: order the s'more brownie item. it will change your life. as the owner and operator of a beard and mustache, it almost made me consider shaving them off due to me realizing hot marshmallow embedded into my hair is not the most glamorous feeling. but wow if that was not the best way to go into a sugar coma that i have had the pleasure of eating in quite a while.\n\nyes, yard house is a chain and yes, you know what you're getting by eating at one. but this one in particular has service and set up down to an art form. more tvs than you could ever watch? extensive seating? a prime location away from most of the touristy things? absolutely. and believe the hype, too - until the owners build one of these in dallas, tx (hint, hint), it will remain a \"must-go\" destination for any upcoming las vegas trips. who am i kidding? even after they build one in dallas, tx (nudge, nudge), i'll still be stopping here.",

            "i know that the <mark>Chicken Tortilla Soup</mark> here is pretty bomb but wheres the service and the people bringing out the food? i was here last saturday night and it took over 15 minutes for someone to even greet us or acknowledge our presence. the host seated us immediately but making us wait that long to acknowledge that we were there didn't impress me. not to mention that the person that came over just came to tell us that our server was coming back from her break shortly. still, not impressed. we ended up leaving because getting someone to take our order took much too long and we had to catch a movie.", 
            "pop quiz: how sad is it that eating at this yard house was one of my most anticipated moments before getting on the plane and heading out to las vegas for a few days? gambling, glitz, girls and other words that start with \"g\" are all fine and dandy, but sometimes a guy just wants to down a few beers, chomp on some outstanding food and unwind in a place where not everyone is a raging tourist carrying an over-sized plastic drink that is watered down and reeks of desperation. this is that place.\n\nmy folks and i actually made it over here before they opened on a monday morning and people were already lined up at 10:50 a.m. that's cool, right? this place clearly has a faithful audience, as evidenced by this review. and once those doors opened, shoot: it's like the customers in line thought the first 10 people in the door got a free unicorn that performs karaoke exclusively to hair metal songs. they rushed the door with a fervent desire to be first in and we just sort of meandered in after them. it's a big place with plenty of seats - there's no point in scrambling over each other to be the first one in. there's a lengthy patio, a surrounded bar and more seating than the average bar would know what to do with.\n\na hostess guided us to a booth opposite a table of nine individuals who exemplified the \"money cannot buy class\" rule. we overheard them tell the waitress they had to be out of there to catch a movie so right away you could tell this had potential to be the table from hell. we already felt for this gal and then we realized she was waiting on us, too! let it be known that tasha, our waitress, got the mvp award for eternity during this shift because when the place opened, it appeared she got triple sat right out of the gate. now i'm not an expert in the service industry but i know how hard it is to recover from a hand dealt like that in the opening minutes. we assured her we were in no rush, mostly because we weren't, and partly because we did not want to witness a breakdown on the floor. to her credit, she kept her cool and was efficient as she was sassy.\n\nspeaking of keeping cool, you might want to psych yourself up before eating here because the menu is positively dickensian with its verbiage. six pages of beer alone?! no, you have not died and gone to heaven; you just happened to wander into a place thriving with variety. being that we stopped in for lunch, we stuck with sandwiches and the must-have lunch combo: a cup of soup and half a sandwich/pizza. mom's <mark>Grilled Chicken & Avocado</mark> sandwich was polished off with ease, dad's... whatever dad ate, was equally delicious, and my <mark>Chicken Tortilla Soup</mark> and <mark>Pepperoni Pizza</mark> were wolfed down in a shameful display almost as noticeable as my preference for hopping around the beer menu: big sky moose drool can totally give way to kronenbourg 1664 if you try.\n\nand through it all tasha managed the suffocating requests of her demanding table, a performance that would go unnoticed if you were not paying attention given that everyone working here is a study in quick service and attentiveness. food runners actually running food? hostesses navigating the dining room with purpose? bartenders keeping their orders flowing? you'd better believe it. we did not see a manager but i am assuming one was on duty, probably sitting in the rafters like batman/woman, waiting to pounce when the need makes itself known.\n\nthere was one last bit of unfinished business: dessert. i'll just say this now: order the s'more brownie item. it will change your life. as the owner and operator of a beard and mustache, it almost made me consider shaving them off due to me realizing hot marshmallow embedded into my hair is not the most glamorous feeling. but wow if that was not the best way to go into a sugar coma that i have had the pleasure of eating in quite a while.\n\nyes, yard house is a chain and yes, you know what you're getting by eating at one. but this one in particular has service and set up down to an art form. more tvs than you could ever watch? extensive seating? a prime location away from most of the touristy things? absolutely. and believe the hype, too - until the owners build one of these in dallas, tx (hint, hint), it will remain a \"must-go\" destination for any upcoming las vegas trips. who am i kidding? even after they build one in dallas, tx (nudge, nudge), i'll still be stopping here.", 
            "our first time on yard house\n\n\nhi everyone today we decided to have a lunch at yard house \nwe believed is going to be great \nbut we had a terrible experience with the customer service for some reason we had four different waiters  ridiculous on my own personal opinion.\nany way we order a <mark>Chicken Tortilla Soup</mark>  really good loved \nbut the steak tacos was bad and we order a carnitas tacos (means pork) and we get a chicken tacos,\n\nmy burger was good half goat and half beef good flavor.\n\nafter a while we told the waiter we order a pork tacos no chicken and takes forever to come back for our table carnitas tacos are bad we don't liked \nnext time when you guys  recommend tacos    give us the choice  on flour or corn tortillas \n\nthis is the cherry at the end of the cake check this out \nthe manager came to talk whit us \nand he said i'm apologize for all the inconvenience but something they i can do for you and i explain everything then you guys already knows and i ask a couple questions from the menu and he don't so have the answers for my and again he said i'm apologizing \nmy reaction was try to fix this little problem because your food is ok but your service is terrible and he said i'm going to give you a free desert for the inconvenience \n\nalright the desert was the only good think from the whole time the we spend on this restaurant  \n\ni guess we had a bad luck :(\ndefinitely i'm not going to come back to this place"

            "after hearing rave reviews from coworkers me and a couple friends finally went on 11-1-2013. we got there at 8pm and sat outside. the waitress took our drink and appetizer order while we waited for our friend. she delivered the drinks and appetizers yet there were no plates nor silverware and napkins on the table. she then turned us over to another waiter who scrambled to get proper settings.the calamari was over cooked ( dark brown and crunchy ).  the main course came; surf and turf.  lets start with the lobster sauteed in garlic butter; dried out piece of rubber that once looked like a piece of lobster. hamburger, medium rare was more like medium sawdust burger. little flavor with zero <mark>Juice</mark>.  the one stalk of asparagus was okay. the fries were somewhat good. i don't know where they hid the bearnaise sauce but it wasn't on our plates.  all that said 3 of us was  $ 130.00 of  utter slop.  save your cash for someplace that actually knows how to cook food."

            "the <mark>Specialty Hot Tea</mark> bar in las vegas is....the yardhouse\n\nb/f and i sat at the bar and each ordered the belgian six pack.  six delicious beers, even if the somewhat mentally challenged bartender didn't put them in the order on the card and on the tray.  like i can't taste the raspberry lambic?  hello???\n\nanyway, the beers were awesome. so many on tap and so many ways to try them. loved the belgians as well as the three cream ale shortys i tried.\n\nhad wings, ribs and burger, as well as sundae and brownie for dessert. all the food was good.\n\nif you can get jon as your bartender at the bar, he is super awesome, nice, smart and funny.  loved him!  the others were okay and i won't give you my opinion of cj.  let's just say it rhymes with \"bouche\".\n\nin sum, loved the yardhouse, loved the beer, loved the food. if you don't go there, you're clearly in need of serious help. for reals.", 
            "this is my second time going to yard house. first time was in los angeles & second time in las vegas. i came here with my family (big party). we were readily seated outdoors. it wasn't hot (vegas weather) since there were mists to keep us cool. however, when they turned it off, the water kept dripping and splashing us.  we were irritated so we placed napkins on the area the water falls to prevent from splashing us. we informed our waiter about it and he said that it's been an ongoing problem and it's still in the process of being fixed.\n\ndj was our waiter for the night. he was very nice in the beginning. yard house is known for their beers on tap. i wanted to try something new. i asked dj for a recommendation. he served me 2 tasting beers. unfortunately, i only remember one of them, leffe blond. when i asked dj what it was again, he was unsure and couldn't remember the name. i was a little confused since he was the one who recommended the beers to me but yet he forgot the name of it.\n\nyard house is very pricey. luckily, we were there during happy hour. i ordered the pastrami sliders ($7) with <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>. the <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> were delicious! it took very long for the food the come out. once the food came out, the <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> were <mark>Specialty Hot Tea</mark> than the sliders. the sliders were very disappointing. i was expecting much from the sliders, but it only had pastrami and cheese. the sliders were also cold!\n\nmy sister also ordered dessert (souffl\\u00e9 & creme brulee) togo. everything was paid for already. dj never came back to check on us to see if we received the dessert order. instead, we had to ask one of the busboy to check on our to-go order. keep in mind we were waiting for 30 minutes already & we ordered the dessert before we were done eating. the busboy followed up and said that they were packing the dessert. after another 20 minutes, we finally received our order from another waiter & not dj. dj never came back after we gave him the money. \n\ni was very disappointed with the waiting time and the service from our waiter. it felt like our waiter didn't want anything but the payment & his tip. his service was not consistent."

            "sad to say that i went on a friday during lent so i had the <mark>Four Cheese</mark> pizza rather than my usual meat filled p<mark>Latte</mark>. the pizza was pretty darn good though and huge considering during happy hour it only cost 6.50. talk about a deal! my roomie had the cuban sandwich and said it was amazing. overall the food tasted pretty great and if you during happy hour i really think it's hard to beat this level of food for this price. a lot of places serve really small portions for their lunch specials or happy hour but i think this place does it right and gives you huge portions hoping you stay around long enough to drink up a nice tab. i for one am willing to fall into this trap any day of the week as long as their food stays on point. last star is missing because although the service was acceptable it wasn't star worthy. \n\ngreat food, good size portions, happy hour makes their food cheap so plan accordingly.\n\n(spinach and <mark>Spinach Cheese Dip</mark> is pretty awesome btw.)",
