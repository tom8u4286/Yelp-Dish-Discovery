            "i've found a new favorite breakfast place! i came here with my husband with the understanding that he would get the red velvet pancakes so i can try them while i order something else that i was curious about. i wasn't trying to be pushy.... i promise...i just wanted to save him from his usual denver omelet order! \n\nwhen we start looking at the menu he weasels his way out of the red velvet pancakes. he promises he will not order a denver omelet so he orders the <mark>Turkey Avocado Sandwich</mark>. he usually eats this type of sandwich for lunch ...he's a creature of habit who am i to change him! we also order a side of sweet cream crepes that we would share. even though i really wanted to try the red velvet pancakes i have been craving filipino food for days. i ended up ordering rick's adobo fried rice instead. \n\nthe adobo fried rice comes wrapped in a sheath of egg. my husband looked at me like \"why did you get to order a omelet and not me?\" i would never do anything like that so i showed him it's was rice. i was afraid that this dish would be too salty but it was perfect! i usually don't like to eat filipino food when i go out because i've been spoiled by my mom's cooking but this was really good! this dish also comes with a side of macaroni salad...dare i say that it tastes better than aloha island grill's version. \n\nthe sweet crepes were also tasty we ordered ours with fresh strawberries. i usually just like a little creme on mine so i just took off the access. i also had a bite of my husband's sandwich...for taste testing purposes ..of course. it was also yummy where everything is portioned out perfectly so not one ingredient in the sandwich is overpowering the other.", 
            "this place is about a 20 min drive from the strip, but i enjoyed having brunch here on a saturday afternoon! the wait was 20 min around 11, fyi.\n\nyes, of course we had to try the red velvet chocolate chip pancakes, which were sweet and delicious. the short stack split amongst 3 people (1 pancake per person) was enough for us, since it was that sweet!\n\nthe spinach eggs benedict were delicious, as well as the <mark>Turkey Avocado Sandwich</mark> (tasted quite healthy and fresh!). this place is decorated with huge butterflies hung on the walls, cute quotes (live, laugh, love) and seats about 40 people. i dig it!", 
            "mehhhhhh. this place is just... ok to me. i agree with arnold d...i don't understand the hype. i've been here a couple times . i've tried biscuits and gravy, kahlua pig benedict, a <mark>Turkey Avocado Sandwich</mark>, corned beef and hash, fried rice & of course the infamous red velvet pancakes. it's not that it didn't taste good it was just that nothing stood out. nothing was amazing or 5 star worthy, just your standard diner tasting food. i love the concept of the place and the little fusion thing going on. but to be honest i prefer breakfast at the egg and i or blueberry hill.."

            "so this is not the place to go if you are counting carbs because even if you resolve to be strong, the gorgeous plates going by will make you feel deprived. i would suggest diving into the experience, this place makes the fall worth it. the waitress was very patient with us, it was a difficult decision!   i had the red velvet pancakes as a dessert with my turkey <mark>Club Sandwich</mark>.  the sandwich was really good, the avocado was just right, lettuce crispy, all was yummy...but the pancakes should have a soundtrack of angels singing.  first the color was an amazing red on the edges and the portion was just right.  they were served with fresh whipped cream on top and a cream-cheesy-butter-syrup to dip or pour over them.  i dipped and dipped again.  i will definitely return to babystacks."

            "yep..i heard about these amazing red velvet pancakes and had to drag the family to that side of town and try em.\nof course the hubby had to try the <mark>Grilled Cheese</mark> and ff. they off the fries seasoned which is nice. his sandwich was pretty ordinary but he was happy.\ni had the special which was a breakfast burrito and that came with 2 of the best pancakes ever!!\nthey come with a small jar of cream cheese syrup and they are sprinkled with chocolate bits and a huge spoonful of whipped cream.\n1st the burrito..it was perfect. i had ham in mine since my little guy loves it and we were sharing. we both tore into it. it had just the right amount of cheese,potato,ham, and eggs. we ate the whole thing.\nnow onto the most wonderful pancakes in the world...\none word: yummy!!!!!\ngo get some now!!! these are amazing. then do some serious cardio cuz god only knows how much sugar/calories there are in them.\ni also ate them both and did not share with the hubby or my baby!\nlol\nits a bit pricey..our bill was almost $24 bucks plus 5 buck tip. and it was on the other side of town. but i will drive here again  for those pancakes.\noh..service was also fantastic!", 
            "overrated! the first time got the red velvet pancakes. those were great. second time, bf and i shared a short stack of carrot and white chocolate pancakes. got the <mark>Grilled Cheese</mark> special with pork and the adobo fried rice omelet. it was all ok. carrot pancakes had a nasty after taste and could only eat with the sauce. they might as well called the <mark>Grilled Cheese</mark> with pork a pork sandwich. it barely had any cheese and almost all pork. not good at all! the only thing i kind of liked was the adobo fried rice but it doesn't even compare to aloha kitchen. service was good. but i would not come back unless i was craving red velvet pancakes. i am not a morning person at all. but i would have preferred another place.", 
            "yes, the red velvet pancakes are awesome--make sure you ask for extra cream cheese \"syrup\". but....there is no way i could eat a stack of them for breakfast! \n\nso we went at lunch time and ordered a stack for dessert! i will admit that they were just the tiniest bit dry but once you pour on that delicious cream cheese syrup, it didn't matter. we thought they might have been just a tiny bit better if they had mini chocolate chips in them (ala red velvet bundts at nothing bundt cakes). we shared the kalua pulled pork <mark>Grilled Cheese</mark> which was solid. really good pulled pork with muenster and cheddar grilled on sourdough.  the fries were crispy but my son said they reminded him of the ore ida frozen fries that are marketed as \"extra crispy fast food fries\". he's right, that's totally what the fries are like. but not terrible.\n\nyoungest kid had a kids meal of scrambled egg, bacon, and hash browns with a s'more pancake on the side. pretty standard fare except for the amazing pancake. it's a pancake with marshmallows, melts chocolate chips, graham cracker crumbs and marshmallow fluff.  so yum.\n\nwe went on a weekday close to 11am and had to wait close to 30 minutes. i'm sure weekends are crazy. our server was great (and cute!) and very apologetic when our red velvet pancakes were delayed due to another server swiping them. \n\nwe'll be back every time we are in vegas.",

            "this review is for 4.5 stars.\n\ninspired by a meeting with my husband's relatives on their quick visit (that was so nice to see them) recently for breakfast at the blueberry hill (yum!) on flamingo/tamarus, i wanted to go out for breakfast on my birthday (a few days ago) and scoped out a few places (1) thanks to yelp, (2) remembered this place, a few months back, from a benefit segment on the news and (3) may have heard about their best seller, red velvet pancakes from a local radio show hostess (we hardly go out for breakfast, but i miss it). i am always checking out menus (but changed my mind on my choice---this menu has a ton of options) and since i'm on a restricted diet, look forward to eating a little more freely on my cheat days. \n\nthis is located in a small strip mall, corner pocket, and is a bit small, but it feels cozy and it is clean---turnaround time is fast because this is a popular breakfast spot (counted about 13 tables, booth and table/chair combos, with the booth side against the walls); not quite, a hole-in-the-wall. my son noticed the giant butterflies on the wall, by stating \"big bugs!\" there were two tv's on opposite ends of the l-shaped restaurant. when we arrived, it was quiet, and many tables were empty. by the time we left, there was only one empty table, two tables if you count ours. when you walk in, there is the cashier (where you pay), and  the menu is posted on the wall at eye-level height (for me anyway, i'm short). \n\nour server was monica, and she was super sweet, outgoing, and helpful (suggestions) when we had questions about the menu. she was also pretty attentive, checking on us many times. \n\nmy husband got the german chocolate pancakes, the full stack. it was huge! it looked really decadent and more like a dessert. i had one, the little guy had half of one, and we took one and a half to-go. it was really good, light and fluffy, but very sweet (caramel sauce), so it's not something i would get (i don't have a sweet tooth). my husband loves his pancakes, but when we go again, said he would get the short stack with a side of something salty, sausage or something. even the guy next to him (got the build your own omelet) was looking at it when it was brought to our table. i got the biscuits and gravy with two <mark>Sausage Links (3)</mark>, and it came with my choice of potatoes, i got them seasoned. the gravy was very good, and the biscuits were soft (four). little man liked the sausage and potatoes. i was going to get the adobo fried rice (that was my 1st choice), but opted for a less heavy item because lunch was going to be ayce sushi, and i really didn't want to spoil my lunch (balance). i really enjoyed the hot chocolate, sprinkled with bits of chocolate (didn't melt), mmm. i would definitely get that again. it was full of flavor, not watered down, and most likely the best cup of hot chocolate i ever had, and when i told my husband, he said \"you downed it quick, someone didn't even offer me a sip\" my oops. if we go to a new place, i try to check out other people's food (but i'm not a neck-stretcher), to see how they look, and also portion size. someone next to us got the red velvet pancakes and they looked decadent. \n\ni will definitely try something different next time. hubby said we could always go out for breakfast and eat in for lunch or dinner, just to switch it off, and that way we could enjoy breakfast out sometime (he is the breakfast maker in our home). \n\nthere are four locations, two on the west side (summerlin, spring valley), one in the centennial area, and henderson. \n\nto reiterate, a popular breakfast spot (all the reviews on yelp, c'mon!), nice staff/very good service, great food, and definitely one place to meet out of town guests for breakfast."

            "so i finally tried this place out!  it has been on my list forever and finally woke up early and drove over.  reading reviews i know the place is small and gets busy so i got there right at 7am on a saturday.  i was the second group to be seated.  within 30 minutes the whole place was filled up and a line was forming.  i was shocked on how fast that happened.  \n\nsince i really came for the red velvet pancakes, that's what i ordered, short stack and a side of <mark>Sausage Patties (2)</mark>.  the rv pancakes were delicious and so filling!!!  i wasn't to fond of syrup stuff they give, its just to sweet for me.  i mean the whole platter is a sugar high but i just couldn't do the syrup.  i would rather have regular syrup, next time.  the pancakes were good enough that really the syrup wasn't needed.  i only hate half the pancakes and took the rest home.  seriously the short stack was just to much, haha.  the <mark>Sausage Patties (2)</mark> were really good and i enjoyed them.  \n\nthe service was great and they were on top of checking up on me, filling my water, etc...  i definitely want to come back again and try some of the other stuff on the menu.  i do know though, its a place to get to first thing because i am hungry when i wake up and get grumpy without food, haha.", 
            "overall, great food! should've ordered <mark>Sausage Patties (2)</mark> instead of links, but my meal was delicious! i tried the red velvet pancakes and they were scrumptious! a bit on the sweet side, which i love, but next time i'll try the t bone steak and just regular pancakes ... or maybe the banana cream short stack? i don't know, everything looks pretty tasty on the menu! staff were friendly, my family and i came on a friday around 11 am and it was packed, no wait though, and staff were hustling and bustling so we left a generous tip for our waitress :)"

            "my family of four (two adults two kids) went for sunday brunch and really enjoyed it!  don't let the sad shape of the mall it is located in fool you. the atmosphere is really nice, the staff friendly, and most importantly, the pancakes are spectacular!\n\nwe ordered two short stacks (3 plate sized pancakes). the kids ordered s'more cakes which had marshmallow pieces cooked into the cake and topped w chocolate shavings and golden gra<mark>Ham (2)</mark>. rave reviews from the younger set. \n\ndad and i split the red velvet pancakes. wow!  these were spectacular. they were moist and fluffy, with a cream cheese topping. some of the best pancakes i've ever eaten. \n\nportions are huge!  we split 2 short stacks and one side order of bacon between 4 people and had leftovers. \n\nsaw some wonderful omlets go by. may have to try one next time. or the bacon filled pancake. or the peanut butter pancake.  bottom line is we will be back for more!", 
            "had to bring the family cause of all the great reviews. we're big breakfast people so when the kids had a day off we went for a visit. the place is clean and bright and was pretty quiet for a weekday morning. \ni ordered the adobo fried rice. disappointing. the rice has hard and had a few charred pieces of chicken lending it a strange burned off -flavor. the egg \"wrap\" was thin and oily. i can usually finish a whole plate but it was so unappetizing i only had a third. the adobo fried rice rules at thelmas... check em out. my husband had the loco moco and it was alright. it was the standard <mark>Ham (2)</mark> patty and brown sauce found in many valley local places, nothing special. the kids had the children's breakfast - eggs & pancakes. also nothing special. our big mistake was getting only a side of red velvet pancakes to \"try em out\". they were heavenly! i almost like em better than nothing bundt cakes red velvet bundt. they came out hot soft and fluffy, with a light puff of whipped cream and choco shaving. there was a side of cream cheese topping which was heavenly drizzled on top. just lovely. it was funny watching a grown man wrestle over pancakes with a determined and hungry five year old. priceless. save yourself some disappointment and go there for the red velvet pancakes... you won't be sorry! \nstaff was very friendly and attentive.  the tables were very small though and crammed together so if you want some breathing room i recommend you come on a weekday cause the weekends are packed!", 
            "what is the hype about this place?  located in a strip mall with a lot of parking, this place has about 6 regular tables and 6 bar tables that use high chairs.  i was going to order the chicken fried steak, but the server said it's frozen and then fried.  i asked about the corned beef hash being made scratch, but it's out of a can.  i asked if they make their biscuits from scratch and the server said \"i think so.\".  i was alarmed.  i went with the kaluha pork eggs benedict with the seasoned potatoes.  very disappointing. the potatoes are just deep fried potato cubes.  no bellpepper and onions.  the pork was smokey and just okay.  my sister had the loco moco. the gravy was bland.  the <mark>Ham (2)</mark> patties had a good flavor.  we also had a short stack of buttermilk cakes.  they were okay.  nothing i would write home about.  140+ yelpers averagin 4.5 stars really had me puzzled.  the food isn't made from scratch.  frozen and canned just don't get me in that 4.5 star mood.  spam is the only canned item i would accept only because you know it's canned.  corned beef hash doesn't mean it's canned unless they say hormel corned beef hash.", 
            "this restaurant appears to be a mixed bag for me.  in some things, it is amazing, and in others, not so great.\n\nfirst as to ambience and first impressions:  the restaurant is small (maximum capacity 50) in an uninspiring but clean strip mall.  upon entering the restaurant, it is clean, with warm homelike decorations and a warm inviting somewhat neutral light brown paint color that you might see in model home.  the decorations are ones that you might get in a bed bath and beyond or pier 1 imports which give the ambience of a homelike restaurant environment.  some of the tables are high stool oriented that use comfortable leather stools as the chairs.  other tables are against the wall using hardwood bench seating as chairs.\n\ninitially the hostess was welcoming.  but within moments the hostess gave a cold uncaring impression.  she stated that the table would be ready in a few minutes and then proceeded to do cashier work, which was fine.  however, three new customers came in and for no less than 5 minutes, she never spoke with the new customers.  not even the quick look up and \"i'll be with you in a minute.\"  she would even walk past myself and other customers and not establish eye contact.  even when she did establish eye contact, there was no smile.  not something that will destroy an experience, but also not something that would help the overall feel of the restaurant.\n\nunfortunately, after being seated no menu was provided and it took the waitress a few pregnant pause minutes to get the menu to me.  i had the feeling that she was the only waitress in the restaurant -- which i later found out was not the case.  \n\nhowever, when she did provide the menu, her attitude and service were warm and friendly with many smilies.  she certainly helped to overcome the feelings that the hostess had created.  \n\nfood:  in this regard too, the restaurant did some things amazingly well, and others oh so mediocre.  for the good, they are known for their red velvet pancakes.  i tried them and they are very good.  if you don't like sweet, don't try them.  they are inviting and indulgent.  they come with a creme cheese syrup.  the two combined make for a taste of red velvet cake combined with a sweetness of a cinnabon roll with syrup.  decadent.  the waitress invited me to have them as a side to my omelette which was just perfect -- rather than a full stack of pancakes.\n\nin addition, i had the mexican omelet which included carnets, jalape\\u00f1os, cilantro, onions, cheese.  the combination of the omelet and the pancake made for a wonderful confluence of tastes from spicy to sweet and then back.\n\nwith such a wonderful combination, the frozen potatoes that came with the omelet was such a violent speed bump on my wonderful country road journey for breakfast.  the potatoes were clearly dull, uninviting in taste and such a contradiction with the other dishes that you are now questioning why you came to the restaurant in the first place.  it is a s<mark>Ham (2)</mark> that they couldn't just pan fry some homemade potatoes to complement an otherwise wonderful meal.  i felt like was experiencing a painting by an artist and as i moved from left to right i realize that the oil painting of the mona lisa is done in exquisite detail, but the background is quickly drawn in crayons because there is a deadline to put out volumes of art.\n\noverall, i would still try to go to the place for an experience.  i would probably go again to see if the experience was the same, but i worry that the generic school cafeteria style could infect other dishes.", 
            "okay okay, i can feel the backlash already. \n\nbut after all the hype about this place, i'm far from being impressed. but yet again, i'm not one to drive into hype. \n\nfirst off, why drive away customers with a sign that exposes a 60 minute wait time when you have a bunch of empty tables waiting to seat hungry patrons? and when we only ended up waiting about 25 minutes (as was everyone else in front of us and behind us), i automatically felt pretty bad at their potential loss of business for those that left because they didn't want to wait \"60 minutes\". i mean cmon now, this isn't disneyland. or maybe it is because one of the waiter's were obviously friends with a party that came in and went straight in to be seated. fast pass. nice. but hey, it was only a 25 minute wait, so i can't complain. \n\nnow on to food. \n\ncuz this is what so many of my friends hyped about. \n\ni ordered the adobo fried rice omelette. okay. folks- save yourselves and just head on over to aloha kitchen or island flavor. now they know how to do it right. if you can't make your adobo correctly and expect to throw it into some fried rice and covered with a thin layer of egg- then don't even bother. learn how to make adobo first- then try and throw it into an \"omelette\". \n\nboyfriend had the loco moco. please, don't even get me started. even him- not being from hawaii- was highly disappointed. gravy was bland and so was the <mark>Ham (2)</mark> patty. which meant-- no flavor whatsoever. cmon folks. get it together. \n\nand now...drum roll please...\n\nthe pancakes. \n\nmacadamia pancakes. \n\ntasted like generic, boxed pancake batter. not mixed correctly with proper measurement of liquids because it was dense beyond belief. really? pancake sticking to the roof of your mouth? what the? and i wouldn't even have known it was macadamia nut pancakes if i hadn't read it myself. the white chocolate chips on it was the only other flavor aside from \"batter\" that you can taste. \n\nred velvet pancakes:\n\nstrike me now babycake fans. \n\nlast time i knew-- red velvet pancakes is a touch of cocoa and chocolate. it shouldn't taste like chocolate chip pancakes. granted, chocolate chip pancakes are delicious (elsewhere-idk about here), but to have chewy and dense red velvet pancakes that don't taste like it? not acceptable. \n\nso now, i'm going to leave my little experience to an anomalous fluke because people seem to love it here and their red velvet pancakes. so maybe i just came in when they just weren't up to par. but i gotta review as i see and experience it. \n\nwill i go back? maybe.", 
            "i stopped by today because my coworker would not stop talking about the red velvet pancakes and the adobo fried rice from this place for the last few weeks. \n\ni ordered both so i could finally see what the hype was about. i started with the rice and i was expecting to taste a fried rice like nothing i have ever tasted before, but that is not what i got. it just tasted like regular fried rice. it came with a scoop of macaroni salad, which was bland. the pancakes were cooked perfectly, but not good enough for me to drive all the way back here for.\n\nmy friend had the loco moco. the <mark>Ham (2)</mark> patty was burnt on the bottom.", 
            "so much ado about nothing.\n\ncould over 250 people who raved and ranted about how great babycakes caf\\u00e9 was be sadly mistaken?  you bet your sweet little buns they could!  after reading so many reviews from ecstatic foodies about how fantastic this restaurant was, i braved the over 18 miles drive to babycakes to get some of their \"famous\" fare.  on a saturday morning, we waited 50 minutes to be seated.  hostess lindy needed some serious lessons in customer service.  she called my name and motioned for me to follow her. she slapped the menu on the table and left without a word. granting that it was a busy morning, a little courtesy would be much appreciated.  i guess, she was doing us a favor by giving us a seat in this unbelievably busy morning.  waiter preston was attentive and cheerful.  he was patient in answering my questions about the dishes and the restaurant operations in general. \n\nnow on to the food recap.  i had the portuguese sausage and two over easy eggs, paired with two small red velvet pancakes.  nothing special with the sausage and eggs, no garnishing at all.  eggworks' version of this dish was more acceptable. anyway, really, how could you mess up commercially bought sausage and fried eggs?  the rvp - what's so special about red colored pancakes?  they were fluffy like the way pancakes should be.  the special sauce was simple condensed milk. if anything was added, it was beyond detection.  verdict:  entr\\u00e9e was acceptable but nothing exceptional.\n\nhubby had the in\"famous\" adobe rice.  since we were told the filipino owner developed all the recipes, i was hopeful i would be enjoying some nasty good adobo rice.  since i read the reviews i knew that it would be served wrapped in scrambled egg like an omelet.  japanese often serve omelets in this fashion so i did not find it strange.  after the first bite, it was clear i was headed for disastrous disappointment. the adobe, which i assumed was pork, was shredded and did not taste anything like filipino adobo. it looked and tasted like reincarnated kalua pig mixed with soy sauce and nothing else.  what a s<mark>Ham (2)</mark> to call this dish \"adobe rice\".  it was clearly a misnomer. verdict:  entr\\u00e9e was crap and an utter waste of money.\n\nconclusion:  there was so much hype about this restaurant.  it was not worth the drive and definitely not worth a second trip.", 
            "this is one the best breakfast spots in town. because of this, you can expect a wait time of 20-30 minutes every day. the place is small, but has plenty of solid food options to choose from. \n\ni tried the loco moco breakfast which was scrambled eggs, white rice, a <mark>Ham (2)</mark> patty, and delicious brown gravy over the top. i also chose to replace the macaroni salad with hash browns. my wife ordered the biscuits and gravy with seasoned potatoes. her plate arrived  with 3 massive biscuits and a white gravy that had bits of sausage throughout. \n\nwe topped off our order with a short stack of their red velvet pancakes. wow-- these are great. however, a little too sweet for me to eat as an entire breakfast. my 3 year old son could not stop talking about these red pancakes, and even wanted them for dinner that same day.\n\nservice is efficient, and the staff is friendly. our bill came out to $28.00  not including tip.", 
            "when you're out of town and you're in vegas, you just want to be in the middle of the action and be on the strip. going anywhere outside the strip just seems sketchy, right?\nwe wanted to meet up a couple of friends, who are both locals, for brunch. we suggested going to the buffet at the cosmopolitan and they both gave us these hesitant, unsure faces. they suggested going to this local mom and pops place instead, which is off the strip. then it was my turn to give the hesitant, unsure look. but when they mentioned \"adobo fried rice\" and \"red velvet pancakes\", i was convinced.\n\nbaby stacks is a small restaurant located in a shopping strip. i was told it was originally named \"baby cakes\", but people kept thinking it was a bakery so they had to change the name.  the place definitely looks like an unpretentiously casual, local diner. nothing fancy, no frills. scanning the menu, the theme of the restaurant seemed to be hawaiian with items like \"loco moco\" and \"kalua pork egg benedict\".\n\nour server, lori (or laurie, lawry, lorie, loree...), who was a very agreeable lady came to take our orders. i decided on getting the \"loco moco with garlic fried rice\", my bf got the \"adobo fried rice\" and we both got half a stack of the red velvet cupcakes.\n\ni loved everything! i was surprised with how i s<mark>Ham (2)</mark> devoured everything, considering that i have a very little stomach for food. maybe, it's my genetic predisposition to love white rice.\n\nthe loco moco has 2 solid beef patties atop rice. (it originally comes with steamed rice but i strongly suggest you get the garlic fried rice instead.) 2 eggs go on top of everything while smothered by some tasty gravy! ultimate comfort food!!!\nthe adobo fried rice is genius idea! you get fried rice mixed with chicken adobo pieces (you can also do garlic fried rice) wrapped in beaten egg. exactly, it is an adobo fried rice omelet.\nthe red velvet pancakes were the perfect way to finish our meal! you think you wouldn't have room for it? think again! the half stack comes with 3 pancakes while the full stack comes with 6. the pancakes are sprinkled with mini chocolate chips with a side of sweet cream cheese sauce. \ni am soooo glad i was convinced to get off the strip. you can almost never go wrong with mom and pops restaurants. *burrrp!*",

            "have you heard what everyone has been saying about the red velvet pancakes?  well, it's true and more. these things are absolutely addictive.  given the description, i really thought these pancakes had to be super sweet.  but they're not.  even my sister, who isn't fond of sweets, loved these pancakes.  \n\nthe staff was nice enough to create a potato dish for my sister with potatoes, cheese, avocado, salsa, and <mark>Sour Cream</mark>.  it was really good and nice of them to be so flexible.\n\ni got the adobo fried rice.  it was ok.  i have to admit, i am not a big fan of filipino food.   same thing with hawaiian food. a little too bland for me.  but i love chinese fried rice, so go figure. \n\nall they had was tabasco sauce, which i didn't think would work.  so i focused on the pancakes and took most of the adobo fried rice home.  heated up the next day and covered in sriracha, it's not too bad.\n\nmost of the tables are high tops which can be a little uncomfortable.  and this place is tiny!  i hope they get a chance to expand.\n\ni looking forward to coming back and trying more of their dishes!", 
            "what more can be rewarding after a 5 hour hike at red rock, i'll tell you what....a good ass breakfast!  my first time here and by the looks of the food on the table and how crowded it was being a wednesday afternoon, i knew it was gonna be good.\n\nmy friend was on her whack diet (she ain't even fat), so she just ordered tuna salad and biscuit with gravy.  i ordered the mexican omelette and red velvet pancakes, which i never there was such a thing.  the mexican omelette had marinated carnitas, sliced jalapenos, pico gallo, pepper jack cheese and topped off with <mark>Sour Cream</mark>.  it was pretty good but the red velvet pancake was the main dish i enjoyed the most.  i have never been a big fan of anything red velvet and this is the first.  she gave me a bite of her biscuit and gravy but i thought she was done with it and i killed it.  haha she was like really, i look down for one second and you eat it all without sharing, ooops.\n\nvery affordable too with friendly servers who attend to you right away and checks up occasionally, despite the place being busy.  i will definitely be coming here for breakfast again. my ex and her tuna salad, what a waste of visit to baby cakes for her.", 
            "omg.  that was amazing!  i got the huntington skillet, and added cilantro and <mark>Sour Cream</mark>.  it was such an amazing breakfast, that i can't wait to dig into the leftovers!  i got my skillet with a side of the red velvet pancakes, which were very good, as every one says.  but.  my son got the banana cream pancakes, which tasted exactly like taking a bite of a banana cream pie!  (note i said a bite - that was all my son would let me have!)  i will definitely go there again,  but next time, i may do carryout - it was a 45 minute wait to eat in. well worth it, but still... i live close enough that carryout might be a better option for me!", 
            "we'd passed this place at least a dozen times and always remarked how we should try it -- and finally we did on easter weekend.  it  was much smaller than we thought inside -- but not too crowded. cozy, i'd call it.  but there are no booths, it's all table seating.\n\nthe staff was really nice and attentive as they could be considering it was pretty busy. we walked in around 10:30 on a saturday morning, but we must've gotten lucky, because despite her saying it would be 20-25 minutes, we were seated within 5 minutes. not too shabby.\n\ni ordered the mexican omelette with buttermilk pancakes instead of toast.  the omelette was delicious -- could've been a little spicier or maybe had another elements, like pico de gallo, but i just hit it with some tabasco and all was well. delicious carnitas, pepper jack cheese, jalapenos and topped with <mark>Sour Cream</mark>. yum. i'd order it again, for sure.\n\ni'm kind of picky about my pancakes. so many places make them heavy or dense or way, way, way too big. i don't need silver dollars, but i prefer them smaller than my face.  these are the exact right size, especially to accompany eggs.\n\ni wanted to try the red velvet pancakes everyone raves about. the guy at the table across from us ordered them and they looked amazing.  babystacks lets you get a specialty pancake instead of just buttermilk in lieu of toast, but i figured if this is a breakfast joint that specializes in pancakes, i should start with the basics. if their buttermilk pancakes are good, the rest probably are, too.  and they were good! i ate them both and ended up bringing home most of my omelette.\n\nnext time, i'd like to try the lemon ricotta stacks or the red velvet. there are really so many to choose from, though i'm not much of a dessert-for-breakfast type of girl, so i likely won't try them all.\n\nbut i'll definitely be back -- it was comparably priced with places like cracked egg just up the street.  and while i love cracked egg, babystacks will provide a nice alternative, especially when i really want pancakes.", 
            "first visit!  nice atmosphere! friendly servers! great service!  \ni had the mexican omelet. it had carnitas, peppers, topped with cheese salsa and lots of <mark>Sour Cream</mark>.  it worked!  <mark>Sour Cream</mark> really made the difference!  hash browns and sourdough toast was \"dennys\" quality.  nothing special. \nmy wife had the sweet cream crepes topped with strawberries. the sweet cream filling was soupy. strawberries must have been out of season cause i counted maybe a dozen slices of strawberries. nothing special. \nwould certainly go back for the omelet i had."
