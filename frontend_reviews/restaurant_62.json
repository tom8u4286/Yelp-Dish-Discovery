            "this was fabulous as far as buffet's go !!! crab legs, <mark>Endless oysters, crab legs and shrimp</mark>, and slipper lobster tails, so many things to choose from.  we left stuffed, and feeling that we got our moneys worth big time !!! \n\nsomeone in line gave us a $10 off coupon for the buffet as well, so that made it more affordable !!", 
            "best seafood buffet in vegas!  beware though, need to come here really early, otherwise you'll be spending most of your precious vacation time waiting in line!\n\nwe came here at 6 pm and had to wait about 15 minutes for a table.  for $40 a pop, we hit the most expensive area 1st!  they have the snow crabs, and a seafood stew type combo consisting of baby lobster tails, jumbo shrimps, and scallops.  they also have one of the juiciest prime rib available.  also available were crawfish; salmon; sushi (not much of a sushi fan!).  they made seafood in many different ways such as chinese style (clams, mussels, crabs, <mark>Endless oysters, crab legs and shrimp</mark> stir fry) or just japanese seafood udon stir fry.", 
            "exceeding every seafood fantasy you could have ever imagined ... be preapred to saturate your taste buds with all the lobster, sushi, <mark>Endless oysters, crab legs and shrimp</mark> prepared in every conceivable way you could imagine!  be forewarned, ladies and gents ... wear comfortable clothing and forget about calorie counting ... indluge indulge indulge b/c to do so otherwise would deprive you of seafood bliss!\n  \nby far my favorite buffet in las vegas ... i always take home a crab leg as a souvenir to hold me over until the next time i return ... i suggest you do the same.  =p  oh, also the desserts are mouth watering and you can't help but want to dip yourself into the mountains of perfectly decorated and decadent sugary displays.  truly orgasmic.  you can go wrong here folks!", 
            "if you like to eat come here, good food, good service, nice atmosphere. the reason i love this buffet is the vaule, with the amount of sushi, lobster, <mark>Endless oysters, crab legs and shrimp</mark> me and my people put away this place is baragin. i wouldn't waste $40 on all you can eat pasta, veggies, or crepeseven if it is \"gourmet\". this is real food and good quality so come here ready to chow down.", 
            "not sure if i had unexpectedly higher expectations from reading all the raving reviews of this newly renovated buffet at the rio, but i thought it was overpriced ($41/person) for the selection of seafood and desserts.\n\nthe utensils were also dirty or have very heavy water stains, which were still nicely wrapped in a napkin.  if you want real lobsters, you will have to have a coupon or pay extra for it. the tiny lobster <mark>Endless oysters, crab legs and shrimp</mark> dish was good, but overly salted.\n\nthe chinese food, were not very good (dim sum station's steamed shrimp dumpling had really thick doughy skin; the food looks like it has been hot-held for hours or just overcooked). the japanese sushi station had just the low end selection of tuna, salmon, california rolls, <mark>Endless oysters, crab legs and shrimp</mark> tempura rolls and a few other, but definitely nothing fancy or higher end). the prime rib and tri-tip station is hit and miss, depending on if you got there when they have the left overs or new roasts.\n\nthe dessert station had a fair selection of sweet treats, but due to understaffing, the guests soon empty the dessert selections and it was a long wait to individually order desserts from the staff manning the pastry station.\n\ni do like the decor and the spacious design of the dining area, although it is relatively small compared to the buffet at the wynn or bellagio.\n\nin my opinion there are far better values at other strip buffets. so it is cool to try once and check it off of your vegas to-do list, but i doubt i will vote to go here again in the future.\n\noh yeah, they do have a full bar, but the drinks you order will cost extra.", 
            "this was the final stop along the cee'z bachelor party express. it had been a couple of years since i had been back to this seafood buffet. from what i recall nina and i were there back in 2004. anyway, they remodeled the interior giving the restaurant a modern feel to it; we spent the entire day rocking the mandalay cabana with our entire crew so it was hard for us to get out to the restaurant early. matter of fact, we barely got to the restaurant the place stopped serving at 10:30pm, it was 9:30 pm, so we went into a wasteful craze and ran through the crab legs, oysters, lobster <mark>Endless oysters, crab legs and shrimp</mark> in a vacuum like manner.\n\nthe place is a little on the pricey side when compared to other buffets, but considering we did not have to stand in line and that the food was good; i was willing to spend the money.", 
            "came here with a few colleagues on a recent meeting, one of them recommending it.\n\nthe place is huge. they have 2 sides/lines of the same items, so you can pick which side has the least people. the assortment is grand. i haven't gone to any other buffet that has the assortment of dishes, seafood, pastries, and desserts as this buffet.\n\nbut the quality just isn't on par with some of the others in the same price range. there were several people waiting for the crab legs and i had to wait for about 5-10 min. some of the seafood like the baked mussels <mark>Endless oysters, crab legs and shrimp</mark> cocktail just didn't seem that fresh and i didn't finish what i took which is rare.\n\nalthough decent, i rather goto the wynn, mandalay bay, or planet hollywood which are on the strip. being that this is on the opposite side of the freeway from the strip, i wouldn't go outta my way coming back.", 
            "i cannot go to vegas without at least having a wet dream about this place.  omg.  the. best. crab ever.\n\nthere's cold crab, steamed crab crab sushi etc. <mark>Endless oysters, crab legs and shrimp</mark>... cold, hot, scampi, mexican style, mediterranean.  lobster.  all you ever need to have a great seafood dinner.  the dessert menu offers the elvis gelato (pb & banana flavor) that is a perfect ending to the seafood fest.\n\nthe price is steep considering the price only.  but if you like seafood and don't waste stomach space on the unnecessary offerings such as pasta, rice and other meaningless carbohydrates then you fill up on seafood and it's totally worth it.\n\nthe line is long.  no shit.  it's hella long.  but they always have that carnaval floating parade overhead and those \"cocktail\"-inspired bartenders that are hella entertaining so the wait isn't like the one at the dmv.  \n\nthe wait staff is always friendly and they are totally attentive.\n\nso yeah there are pros and cons but the pros far outweigh the cons.  plus it's not that standard boring buffet.  (did i mention the oysters!!?)\n\nyay.  i heart village seafood buffet.", 
            "4.5 stars definitely.\n\nas a seafood lover, i cannot get over the fact of how freakishly delicious the crab claws (both regular + rock crabs were available!!!!), the snow crab legs, and the oysters <mark>Endless oysters, crab legs and shrimp</mark> all tasted at a buffet.\n\nmy group also spent 2 hours here as we did with the wynn buffet. we spent the first hour just devouring plate after plate after plate of the crab claws and oysters <mark>Endless oysters, crab legs and shrimp</mark>. i would say it was close to being as good as sex (and very very few things get that close), just based solely on the freshness and sweetness of the crab, <mark>Endless oysters, crab legs and shrimp</mark> alone. i apologize to all the surrounding people who were scarred for life after watching the monstrosity of a scene of the slurping, mumbling, and violent merciless cracking that my friends and i created during this time. the waiter was very nice and laughed as he switched out each of the 9 or 10 baskets of empty seafood carcasses that had been laid to waste by our ravenous appetite. \n\nwe spent the 2nd hour trying all the different regional dishes and all turned out ok, nothing spectacular but enough to satisfy many different palettes. the dessert and gelato station was alright, but similar to other buffet dessert stations. i remember the sea bass and tilapia fillet dishes both being quite tasty, herby, and fresh. the sashimi selection were surprisingly good as well, the salmon was quite silky and buttery smooth.\n\nif you love crab claws, legs, shrimp, raw oysters, and seafood... it is worth the $40. if not look elsewhere with more selection like the wynn or the bellagio. i have no idea how they could've profited from the amount that my friends and i shoved down our bellies.\n\n100% sure hitting this again for the claws and half shells next time i'm in vegas.", 
            "me:  i'm walking as fast as i can.\nhe:  i told you we'd be doing a lot of walking.  i dunno why you wore those shoes.\nme:  hmmmppfff.  \n\nafter all the blood and guts from the ufc fight, we were famished.  we rushed out to beat the crowd.  oh, my poor feet. :(  our next destination was the rio seafood buffet.  it was almost 10:00 pm and my vegas resident cousin had informed me that the buffet closed at 11.  so we walked as fast as we could...well, i tried to anyway.  \n\nafter a couple of miles, some blisters, and a quick hop on the freeway, we finally arrived.  it was 10:10 pm.  the staff corrected our information by saying the buffet would close at 10:30.  that meant they would stop serving new food after 10:30.  hmmm...we had 20 minutes for ayce at $41 per person...was it worth it???  oh, what the hell...we were already there.  \n\nthey had a huge selection to choose from.  i love shrimp so i grabbed anything and everything shrimp...except the shrimp cocktail.  it was late and that usually upsets my tummy so it wasn't a good idea.  i had lobster, shrimp, fish, shrimp, <mark>Endless oysters, crab legs and shrimp</mark>, clams, shrimp, rib eye. shrimp, sushi, shrimp, and more... did i mention shrimp?  we ate way too much, way too fast.  it's all kinda blurry now.  pure gluttony.  \n\nwe sat in silence for a while staring at the empty plates in front of us.\n\nhe:  should i eat more? \nme:  uh...sure.\nhe:  i don't think i can.\nme:  then stop.\nhe:  ughhh...my stomach!  my kidneys hurt now!  why did you let me eat so much?!?!\nme:  i was trying to let you eat your money's worth.\nhe:  i'm not eating at a buffet for a long time.", 
            "best buffet? i'm not too sure about that. but it is up there. it's different from the other buffets u see at vegas. this one focuses on mainly seafood. but that doesnt mean it's only seafood. they still offer meat dishes. \nthey dont have king crab legs, they have snow crabs. and it's really fresh and tasty. raw oysters were okay, i've had better...but yes, after all it is a buffet. they also offer stone crab claws - not bad. they have raw clams - not so great. the usual cocktail shrimps.\n\nfor the hot dishes, they have other mixed seafood. which was okay.\n\nthey do have a sushi bar where they ahve just sashimi of tuna (ok), salmon (ok), and yellowtail (not good).\n\nthey also have an asian section w/ dishes like bbq pork, stir fry clams w/ black bean sauce, <mark>Endless oysters, crab legs and shrimp</mark> rolls, just to name a few.\n\ndessert...surprisingly, the desserts were pretty good. and the best of all the gelato machine..sooo many choices! i think i had about  5 different scoops.", 
            "i love this buffet because of the obvious... it's seafood!!!  i think there might be other things like prime rib, but why would you eat prime rib when this is 99% seafood.  so, i was so glad that on our last night (after the machida fight!), we got to go here.  and it was just as good as i remembered...\n\ncrawfish, crab legs (both cold and warm... and they're different styles ex. tossed in an asian sauce), fish galore (ones in a chunky tomato sauce, shrimp tempura, mediterranian style, etc.  i will say, some had a fishy taste to it so after a while i just stuck to eating my ginormous plate of crab legs), hush puppies, sushi, seafood soup (2 types, a cajun style and another one i forget), you can make tacos, eat stir fried noodles with chicken <mark>Endless oysters, crab legs and shrimp</mark>, they of course have shrimp cocktail, and mussels, clams, and oysters.  all i know is, this is my dream buffet, and i hate that they don't have one of this kind in hawaii.  yes we have todai, and makino chaya... but that's more of an asian buffet (plus the crab legs, sashimi, etc.), but this is the epitome of buffets, and, may i add, well worth the $42 per person.  \n\ni'd move back to vegas just for this buffet, but that's a dream within itself... but don't let my dreams get in your way of experiencing the best seafood buffet i have tried.", 
            "i've always avoided buffets that cost more than $30. i mean, could i really eat that much food? so when i saw the $38 (before tax) price tag, i was a little taken back, but my friends insisted on eating some good seafood. \n\nthis place was pretty impressive! i was totally surprised. i usually don't give much credit to buffets (even in vegas). i mean, you never know how long that stuff has been sitting there. \n\nthey had all the seafood you could imagine... snow crab legs, crawfish, mussels, clams, raw oysters, lobster?? craziness. i was a little scared of the oysters, worrying that i would get sick. so i picked the smallest, best looking oyster to try. and... it was actually... great! =o *gasp* i didn't take my chances at eating anymore than that. the other ones didn't look up to par. but i totally filled up on the mini lobster tails. i'm pretty sure my cholesterol took a good hit...\n\nshellfish + melted butter = heart attack\n\nanother surprising goodie they had was their sashimi! ive never had a really good experience with sashimi and sushi at buffets, but the fish here was really fresh! the sushi rice is a little hard, so it's best to just stick to the raw stuff. i really liked the salmon sashimi. =)\n\nand of course, they have your basic carving station. the prime rib was really good. and it was cooked a perfect medium rare. i totally loved it. and of course, they had au jus to go with it! they also had thick, fall off the bone ribs, chicken wings, deep fried clam strips <mark>Endless oysters, crab legs and shrimp</mark>... way too much food for my stomach to handle. \n\nand then... there was the dessert bar... o... m... g... i've never tasted a dessert bar like this one. i was prepared for dry cake, overly sweet frosting and chocolate covered everything. but no, no, no... this was the best dessert bar ever! i loved their mini beignets. i tried everything... black forrest cake, chocolate mousse, creme brulee, carrot cake, fudge brownie cake... all fabulous. and they have a wheel of gelato! coffee, mango, strawberry... you can choose from about 10 flavors. all were droolworthy. \n\nanother thing to mention, the service here is fantastic. all the waitress were super friendly and very prompt. they all had some personality rather than just picking up plates and running off. \n\ni would come back to eat here eventually, but with so many other buffets and restaurants on the strip, it's hard to do repeat places to eat. i would say this buffet is worth the money if you either (a) stuff your face enough or (b) eat enough lobster. =p have fun and go get your cholestrol on!", 
            "i hate buffets-the negatives of a buffet out weights the benefits for me, but when we asked our taxi driver where to eat he immediately said go to the rio seafood buffet-not the bellagio.  thanks pal! great call.\n\nthis place is ridiculous and is a good indicator why people are overweight.  i couldn't nor did i want to stop eating.  chilled - lobster tails, crab legs, <mark>Endless oysters, crab legs and shrimp</mark>,   prime rib cooked properly and several asian dishes- roasted duck and pork, steamed buns....just a ton of great food.  the desert bar was insane-homeade gelato, bread pudding and small little custard cups.\n\noh and they have a salad bar and nice breads, but come on who gets salad and bread at a buffet.\n\nit was about 50 after tax and tip but what a good place to go crazy.", 
            "love this place. eat like a straight baller for 40 bucks, come hungry so you can get your money's worth. everything you can think of on the seafood tip is here. crab, lobster, crayfish, <mark>Endless oysters, crab legs and shrimp</mark>, blah blah blah, you get the picture. anyways definitely recommend checkin this place out if you wanna be a true american and eat like a pig for a night. just make sure you have a way to get back to your hotel pretty fast, because your gonna most likely slip into a food coma after stuffing yourself.",

            "wow! village seafood buffet you had me at sea... why would you need a seafood buffet, when every buffet in las vegas has seafood?  if you are like me sometimes you go to the buffet just for the seafood. if you skip all the other dishes and head straight to the seafood, village seafood buffet located in the rio hotel is for you! \n\nmy first time staying at rio.. i was getting ready to go to the carnival world buffet (which is las vegas largest buffet), but i read about the seafood buffet ayce seafood, lobster, king crap, and oysters. whatt???!!! oysters and lobster! that's a first! every buffet has king crap <mark>Endless oysters, crab legs and shrimp</mark>, but raw oysters? yum! at around $38 dollar per person, this buffet easily rivals wynn buffet for the most expensive buffet in vegas. after checking in to the hotel i received a coupon book with $10 bucks off. how could i say no? \n\nwhen you first enter the buffet it looks sorta like todai (yuck don't ever go there!!), but a lot better. i highly recommend going for the oysters and king crab first. also, another great strategy would be eat the raw foods first and go for the cooked seafood later. i would not recommend using the same fork for raw and cooked food, maybe you can wipe it off with a napkin. keep you stomach happy and you will be a true ayce specialist. \n\noysters were awesome! no fishy taste or smell means they are fresh! king crab legs and claws with butter and i'm in heaven. the cocktail shrimp was pretty normal. i was hoping they would be jumbo shrimp like wynn and pre-peeled. the lobster tail did not blow me away. i expected something like boston lobster or at least lobster tail with butter, but instead i received chopped up lobster tail with pieces of shrimp. if it weren't for the shells, most people would not be able to tell the difference between mini lobster tails <mark>Endless oysters, crab legs and shrimp</mark>. this did not look like the images on the tv outside of the buffet. keep it simple don't fry my lobster! this method dries out the lobster at that point you might as well just cock shrimp, its cheaper. just broil it and give me some lemons and butter. \n\nthere are other items like steak and some asian cuisine, but i recommend skipping those items completely and focus at the task at hand which is concur the seafood! the other items are delicious, but save it for another day another buffet. man vs. seafood only please! get your 40 dollars worth. stock up for all the days you wanted seafood and couldn't have it. another side note... the desserts were very disappointing. i think i have more options of dessert in the frozen section of a grocery store. no pies or cakes just mini tart things and by mini i mean mini. the gelato or ice cream what ever it is. didn't taste like gelato, ice cream, or frozen yogurt so i'm not sure what it was exactly. the coffee \"gelato\" did not taste like coffee. it taste more like a sbucks frappuccino after the ice melts and its just cream and ice water. next time i will skip the dessert and just eat the seafood. *small disappointment.. where the cajun/ creole food?? i want some gumbo, jambalaya or at least some lobster bisque. the service was great! servers constantly empty the shell baskets and refilled my delicious ice tea and coffee.\n\nhighly recommend for seafood only. get ready to get your hands dirty and enjoy the freshest seafood you have ever tasted in the middle of the desert. bring a friend and coupon. enjoy.", 
            "best buffet in vegas!!! i love this place. everytime i am in town, i will always try to come here. \n\nthe only thing i really eat is the crab legs, crab claws, <mark>Endless oysters, crab legs and shrimp</mark>. i have to eat the most expensive stuffs in order to get my money worth!! \n\nlove love love the crab here. they also have a wide variety of gelato - not too good but good enough to end the meal.", 
            "how many stars can you really give a buffet? the thing with most buffets is that the focus is quantity, not quality. although the seafood buffet at the rio in las vegas is a touch above many others in food, the atmosphere is just average.\ni was excited to try this place because of the all-you-can-eat crab legs and lobster tails. not to mention all the other seafood delights. it was decently fresh for the most part. i'd compare it to what you might find at your local grocer. the steamed crab legs were good, nothing more. the lobster tails were little. i expected at least 4 or 5 oz. tails, but the ones they serve are probably 1, maybe 2 oz. if you're lucky. the flavor wasn't all that great on them either.\nit was cool to see that they offered crawdads, scallops, different types of fish <mark>Endless oysters, crab legs and shrimp</mark> all prepared in styles from around the globe. they had a mediterranean section, latin section, asian section so that you could try seafood in many different styles and flavors.\nthe dessert bar was ok. the best offering it has is the gelateria - i got a cookies and cream gelato that was really yummy.\noverall id' give it 3 1/2 stars for the good selection and decent tasting food. but for the price ($40/person) i'd just as soon have other vegas buffets that are cheaper yet still offer pretty much everything the rio does, except for the lobster, for $10 cheaper.",

            "i've always seen signs for this buffet, but since it's a bit off the strip, it was always a bit inconvenient for us.  we decided to give it a try this time, and it wasn't bad at all.  \n\nwhen we first got there, the line looked a bit intimidating.  it went out the door, looped around the escalators, and down a bit more.  we stood in line and watched the rio bartenders do tricks, so the wait actually wasn't too bad.  it went by pretty quickly, and we were seated quite promptly.  \n\nthey had a decent array of choices - from asian to cajun, crustaceans to barbecue.  my favorites were - of course - the <mark>Endless oysters, crab legs and shrimp</mark>.  those two alone made me a very happy camper.  the legs were not salted!!  most buffets in vegas salt their crab legs to preserve them.. but not here!  :d  big kudos for that!  they were easy to crack, and super sweet and juicy.  i also really enjoyed the new england clam chowder.. yummy!!  \n\nanother portion i really look forward to at buffets are the desserts.  sadly, i was not impressed.  however, they did have gelato though!  for some reason, i was loving the cantaloupe and honeydews way more!  the strawberries were delicious too - add the chocolate syrup and you have a chocolate fondue!!   \n\ni don't know if i'd come back necessarily.. it is a bit inconvenient as i've said before.. but definitely enjoyed it while i was there!", 
            "3.5 stars although i probably would've given them 3 if not for my most recent visit.  during better times, the seafood buffet was the bomb!  long lines to get in and plenty of choices to choose from when getting to the seafood choices.  this time, no line to get in at 7pm on a saturday night!  \n\none thing i love is getting a butter shrimped scampi or cleaned peeled shrimp with cocktail sauce. what did i see?  cleaned but unpeeled shrimp!  come on!  i'm on vacation!  you want me to peel shrimp?  \n\nhaving been here a couple of times, i had noticed that the \"seafood\" in seafood buffet has dwindled a bit.  when i took a look at what they offered, i can see that maybe 55-60% of the buffet was seafood with the remaining part offering meat or other cuisines that offered meat dishes or seafood dishes.  the shrimp dumpling that they had wasn't so great...i've had better.their baja included fajitas and things didn't impress me.  however their pork spareribs were unexpectedly awesome.\n\nthere are so many ways to prepare seafood dishes.  for example, i'd love to see if they could had made something inspired from the south or maybe something done asian style like with miso.  instead we got a couple of baked seafood items and the usual array of deep fried calamari, clam strips, <mark>Endless oysters, crab legs and shrimp</mark>.\n\ni made sure to not forget about dessert.  the gelato selection that they have over there is excellent!  i had the blueberry cheesecake gelato and it rocked my world.  they also had the elvis, peanut butter/jelly/banana!  no thanks...i'm not ready to channel elvis after a full meal like that.\n\nfor $48, i hoped to have the same experience as before.  they really need to change things up a bit.  during my meal, i was having one of those cravings for a red lobster like cheesy biscuit.  when you're thinking of red lobster while at a vegas seafood buffet, then you know something is amiss here.  \n\ni'd definitely come back if they looked into making their seafood buffet more focused to what they advertise.", 
            "this can be a rewarding experience if you plan for it, leaving those rookie buffet-goer mistakes at the door.\nknown only as \"the silent hunter\" by family and friends, my demeanor morphs from free spirit into a wily predator about to viciously attack his prey when at a buffet such as this.\n\nhere are my tips for a successful buffet outing at rio's seafood buffet: \n\n*  on the day of the buffet, no lunch or unnecessary snacking\n\nat the buffet:\n\n*   no salads, breads, or any other useless filler foods. their conspicuous \n     presence near the <mark>Endless oysters, crab legs and shrimp</mark> could throw you off your game.\n     don't fall for it.\n\n*  your table waiter will take your drink order. be prepared for its arrival in a large\n    red plastic cup roughly the same size as one of those big gulps, another clever \n    ruse designed to slow your eating stride. too much liquid, forget it.\n\n*  the shrimp. oldest trick in the book! it's still in the shell, not good. time is your \n    biggest opponent here  eating slowly will cut your consumption rate by almost \n    half. (i have no empirical data to support this, just a guess)  i know it's tempting \n    but don't bother with the shrimp, not now at least. we'll come back to that in a\n    a moment.\n\nand this brings us to the piece de resistance ; the crab. a couple of problems however. let's walk through them shall we?\n  \nfirst, its still in the shell and cold, sitting on an ice bed since god knows when.\nsecond, its snow crab, not much yield for the effort.\n\nhere's what you do.\nbring a pair of gloves with you to the restaurant. white gloves, with which you'll inform your server of their concealing a rare medical condition; \"i've got leprosy\", you inform her, \"unless you want a rotting-skin, shit-show on your hands, you'll need to remove the shells from my crab. you'll also need to heat it up for me...my gums are sensitive to cold. oh, and bring some clarified butter, and maybe a pound o' shrimp while you're at it, peeled of course.\"\n\nnow eat my friend.\neat until you mightily swell like a blue tick, or, until the manager asks you to leave, or, you explode, whichever comes first.\nnow go and enjoy.", 
            "the other evening, i felt like bubba in the forrest gump movie, shrimp this <mark>Endless oysters, crab legs and shrimp</mark> that, and with so many combinations to choose from, hot, cold, on ice, in a spicy broth, with rice, yada yada yada -- it was all glorious.  of the 152 (or so) items, i may have tasted 37 of them (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/village-seafood-buffet-las-vegas?select=jrmxfc66ww1ldr1nsqnymg#ykapn9hxhtwf0nqv9uwzka), and returned again for 5 items, and then again for 2 of my favorites, and again for the same 2 favs, and again for the same 2 favs, until i nearly busted.  clearly, the best dish was the steamed mix of lobster tails (small 2-3\" but who cares, grab 30 of'em) and butterflied large shrimp (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/village-seafood-buffet-las-vegas?select=jrmxfc66ww1ldr1nsqnymg#ml546xqpekewfaw1blgmow).  this beats setting out nets to catch on my own, or waking up at 4am to go fishing.  when the last shrimp rolled around for about 3 minutes before i could swallow it, i knew the feast was over for me -- i was clearly out of the contest.\n\nwith varied stations of seafood (hot and cold), and alternatives (a small bit of mexican, salads, sushi, and mediterranean among others), a carving station, etc, village seafood buffet is exactly as it states \"seafood\", and this is the kind of village i'd like to live in.  the rent is a bit high at $44.95 ($5 off with players card).  but c'mon, you know your a play'a...and it's your turn to take that position over, as i've died and gone to heaven.\n\np.s.  for an extra $11.95, you can add aycd wine or beer during your dining.\n\npss.  don't forget to take the lobster mashed potatoes...it's soooo good!", 
            "i wanted this to be great so bad, but $45 for all you can eat less than stellar seafood just makes me sad. i was envisioning big king crab legs and meaty lobster tails <mark>Endless oysters, crab legs and shrimp</mark>.  the shrimp part was true, the crab legs were skinny minnies, and there was a tray of cooked little lobster tails (looked more like big shrimp than anything).  and it's not even on the strip, and vegas cabs are way more expensive than chicago or nyc taxis. this might be a better place for lunch.", 
            "shucked scallops?!  soooo good!!!! oysters were nice and meaty!  recommended!  lobster tails <mark>Endless oysters, crab legs and shrimp</mark> were very very bland....like its been frozen way too long... minus one star.", 
            "i went to the village seafood buffet for my birthday last month. i have to say that it definitely met my expectations. honestly with a seafood buffet the main thing you want is obviously your favorite seafoods and an abundance of it. i don't think you can expect amazing quality from any buffet so i didn't go in expecting 5 star gourmet food. but all in all i enjoyed and i think if you're looking for a place to chow down on all the <mark>Endless oysters, crab legs and shrimp</mark> scampi you can handle then this isn't a bad place to go!", 
            "brought the wife here for her first time. it didn't disappoint. if you like lobster <mark>Endless oysters, crab legs and shrimp</mark> and even prime rib this is the spot for you.", 
            "not bad. wait in line was less than 15 min may have been slow night :-).. crab legs well seasoned and meaty! plenty of scallops <mark>Endless oysters, crab legs and shrimp</mark> boiled, fried, or saut\\u00e9ed. lobster was okay left more to be desired. for fifty dollars at least wine and beer should have been included! sorbet plentiful and tasty. left me able to be full and ready to sleep like a baby.", 
            "its not cheap ($50 per person) but its a seafood lovers dream. to be honest the only seafood i like is lobster, tuna, <mark>Endless oysters, crab legs and shrimp</mark> so everything else just stinks to me.\n\neveryone else loved it they did have a huge selection, also chicken, prime rib so there was alot to choose from. also lots of fresh sushi and desserts looked delish. \n\nhuge bar in the middle of the buffet and for $20 more you can get unlimited drinks. good food, but overall next time save dinner for somewhere on the strip.", 
            "this buffet is mouth-watering delicious. throughout my short vegas trip, this buffet was definitely one of my highlights. i love seafood and this place did not support. it's located in rio, which is off the strip but it's definitely worth the short trip to get away from everyone on the strip lol. the snow crab legs are a must and you have to dip it in their garlic butter! their regular crab legs are amazing as well, once again dip it in their garlic butter! if you come here, be prepared to eat many crab legs because it's so good that you don't want to stop. \n\nbesides crab legs, they serve sashimi and sushi and surprisingly, the quality of the sashimi is not bad for a buffet. they had an assortment of salmon, tuna, and tilapia. the tilapia sashimi was interesting since i never tried it raw but the salmon was delicious. the sushi chef could have cut it in equal sizes since they were of different sizes and the size of the sashimi does depend on how it tastes. nonetheless, it was still delicious! as for sushi, they had spicy tuna roll, salmon maki, shrimp maki, kimbap (korean sushi), <mark>Endless oysters, crab legs and shrimp</mark> tempura roll. \n\nthey also had raw oysters and scallops but definitely skip the oysters because they were not good when i went. the scallops, however, were pretty good. they had fried clam strips (must get), fried scallops, fried calamari (tasted like mozzarella sticks, meh), and fries. their grilled squid is amazing! it's so soft and flavorful, it melts in your mouth. next to it, they have their prime rib which is hella good for a seafood buffet! \n\nlastly, for dessert, their mini fruit tart is held together in chocolate and sweet cream, and it's so good! they also have yummy gelato in this cool looking freezer and  they have so many flavors to choose from (thai tea, green tea, cookies and cream, etc.) the dessert section was definitely not lacking and was a wonderful completion to a delicious meal. \n\ntheir service is also very friendly and attentive, our server continuously cleared out our waste bin and filled our waters. \n\nif you are ever in vegas, you definitely have to come here for dinner or as a late lunch since they open at 3:30. it's pricey for $50 per person but it's worth it depending on how many crab legs you can eat haha. this place is the best buffet i have ever been to in vegas. do not go to carnival world buffet that is also in rio because it is not good at all. even though it's cheap, it is one of the worse buffets in vegas. \n\ntrust me, you will love this place!", 
            "this is my first time here and i have mixed feelings.  the service is outstanding (elvia was great we didn't want for anything)  i'll give the staff 5 stars.  the selection of food is mind boggling. if seafood is your thing then this is the place for you.  my only gripe is the food (lobster, shrimp and other.....) was not seasoned that well.  i do understand that taste is subjective. the lobster <mark>Endless oysters, crab legs and shrimp</mark> didn't really taste like lobster <mark>Endless oysters, crab legs and shrimp</mark>.  it like they used some sort of salt brine. with that said, if you are big on flavor you might not be that satisfied...... fyi $97.27 is what i paid for two", 
            "objectively, based on taste, quality and selection, this place deserves three stars. subjectively, i really liked this place, the quality wasn't there but man i loved this place.\n\nthis is mainly a seafood restaurant consisting of crab legs, mussels, shrimp, clams, craw fish and oysters. \n\nthey have a fried section of seafood which include fried fish, clams, oysters <mark>Endless oysters, crab legs and shrimp</mark>. i loved the fried oysters because it's hard to find. although i didn't mind, i wish they used a panko batter instead of the thicker southern style batter.\n\nthere's conventional buffet food like prime rib, fried chicken, veggies, but be warned there's not much! this buffet is tailored for seafood lovers and seafood lovers only. so if you don't like seafood, go elsewhere otherwise be expecting to pay a hefty price and not eating much.\n\nthe sushi section was pretty standard for a buffet style. don't expect the quality to be the same of a sushi bar.\n\noverall average seafood quality with a lot of quantity. loosen up your belt because your mouth will become a trash disposal for seafood!", 
            "fellow yelpers looking for a good meal in las vegas, this is a good spot. village seafood buffet came on high recommendation from several people, including vegas natives, so i had to try it. it seemed like people had widely varying opinions of every single strip buffet, so i eventually had to just give one a shot. now, i'll be the first to tell you that while i love seafood, i'm not an expert. there were a couple things that weren't good, and i'm sure those crummy things rotate depending on the night. today it was the cajun heads-on shrimp. super mushy. not good. otherwise, the selection was great, and the flavor was quite good. \na few things i tried to find out and couldn't with reviews:\nthey offer lobster and several kinds of crab legs on weekdays as well. i don't know if anything changes on the weekends, but the selection didn't feel lacking on a wednesday night. \nthere is plenty of chilled crab legs, <mark>Endless oysters, crab legs and shrimp</mark>, etc. but there are also warm legs, which i personally prefer. \nthe lobster is small, but hey, have as many as you want. they're just out there for the taking. \na couple other learnings:\ndon't tip ahead of time upon entry. no incentive to perform. the service from our waiter was poor, and the tip i'd already paid was not even close to being earned. we're not drinkers, and as soon as he found out we weren't, we hardly saw him again, even when we needed someone to fill our glasses or remove our empty plates. when he did finally come by, he wasn't friendly or personable. sorry jose, you lost rio a star on this one. \nfinally, i suggest learning or reviewing how to eat crawfish beforehand. still not sure how to properly eat those strange red insects.\nmany monies, but a great meal, and one that's difficult to find anywhere else.", 
            "seriously overpriced! we love seafood and last time we ate here we were so disappointed! the freshness is gone. the crab legs were still frozen and heavily salted and the lobster tails were gross and smelled old. this used to be the best seafood buffet but it is no longer! the sushi was okay <mark>Endless oysters, crab legs and shrimp</mark> dishes were okay but not worth the price! this was the best deal for lobster but sadly we won't be back!"

            "it hurts me to say this but i am very, very disappointed. i have been to this buffet countless times, however, it  had been about 5 years since i was last there. i must say that the quality has definitely deteriorated.\n\ni am usually the one that forces my party to go there, but, that wont be the case in the future. \n\nthese were my reasons for disappointment:\n\nits seafood so i will expect freshness!\n\nthe fresh oysters on the half shell were tiny and did not taste fresh. the sashimi looked great, but it was warm...ewwww gross...and flavorless. the tiny lobster tails looked like crawfish, were rubbery and salty. the crab legs were tiny as well, and they were also salty and too much trouble for what they were worth.\n\nok, they do have a few good things--non seafood items--but they are things you can get at any other buffet in vegas for half the price. they have decent prime rib. and, their desserts are good.\n\nall in all, i was soooo sad because i always enjoyed this place. however, it's no longer worth it. next time i will opt for any of my other favorite buffets (bellagio, paris, etc.). heck, even the buffet of <mark>Freshly imported catch from around the world</mark> was better",

            "want to get out of the oc and get your healthy seafood serving for the day? head on out to las vegas and stop at the rio hotel. the hotel is located off of the 15 freeway and flamingo boulevard. there is ample parking all around the property, but the best is the parking structure right off of flamingo. it has a sky bridge from the structure right to the masquerade village area. take the escalator down to the casino floor and you'll see the village seafood buffet on your right. check the rio's website for buffet times as they change periodically. it is also wise to arrive before it opens or might be waiting for a while (bring comfortable shoes for standing if you don't get there early). \n\nthe d\\u00e9cor was recently updated. it originally had the d\\u00e9cor of a fishing port - seafood crates, ropes, old cannery box labels, etc. now, it's more chic with a more upscale feel. the dining room is very open and showcases the wonderful seafood the way it should be.\n\nthis is a seafood lover's dream and won't disappoint. it is one of the pricier buffets in vegas so if you don't like seafood, you can sit this one out. the carnival world buffet might be better suited for you on the other side of rio's property. well, let's get started with the showcase.\n\nchilled on ice, you will find peel and eat shrimp (all that your heart desires), crawfish (aka nawlins mug bugs), freshly steamed and chilled mussels and snow crab legs, and oysters on the half shell. remember, don't be shy to smell your seafood before you eat it, especially when it comes to raw shell fish. they should smell like fresh sea water. if you're not quite sure, put it down and try another one. the rio has the highest quality of seafood, but it is always beneficial to make sure yourself.\n\non the steam table, they have tons of choices from hot, steamed crab legs with drawn butter, clams, and other seafood delicacies. they also have the best carved prime rib in town with au jus and horseradish. so you can have some turf with your surf (emphasizing surf in a big way).\n\nthey also have a sushi bar. if you are a sushi newbie, this is the best way to try and not feel bad about not eating it. grab a plate, pour yourself a side cup of shoyu (soy sauce) and a glob of wasabi (japanese horseradish) and start choosing your pieces - they have sashimi (raw salmon, tuna, red snapper cuts) to intricate rolls like spicy tuna. if you're not sure, ask one of the sushi chefs behind the counter. they are always happy to answer your questions.\n\nthey call it the seven seas so you can take a trip <mark>Freshly imported catch from around the world</mark> from the mediterranean, pacific rim, baja, and south america. go light on these areas as they have a lot of pasta, breaded, and starchy items that may fill you up too quickly. and you really want to at least sample something from every section.\n\nlast, but not least, the desserts bar. the rio has the best desserts from pies to cakes to cookies to gelato. spin the wheel of gelato with flavors like pineapple coconut, chocolate, strawberry, tiramisu, and elvis. i'm not going to spoil this surprise so you'll just have to visit the buffet to find out what the elvis flavor has in it for yourself. they also make mini versions of decadent desserts you'll find in fine dining restaurants - cr\\u00e8me brulee, chocolate covered strawberries, cannolis, and much more.\n\nif you're feeling lucky, take a drive out to vegas. you'll definitely get a triple 7 at the village seafood buffet.", 
            "stretchy pants!! that's what i recommend to wear while eating here. their carnival buffet surely is a \"carnival.\" there is so much food and the variety of food takes you on a mini trip <mark>Freshly imported catch from around the world</mark>. it's great! especially if you're like me and like to try a bit of everything. there's a selection of asian, mexican, american, italian, and so much variety of food. it gives you a chance to venture out and try things you normally wouldn't eat.\n\nwe got a great deal by purchasing meal tickets from the tix 4 tonight booth. we scored buffet tickets for half the price. the quality if the food isn't as good as the wynn or bellagio but it's very good for the price. it's definitely worth it and it offers the biggest buffet selection i've seen on the strip.",

            "rather than trudge across town to the m resort, my family and i decided to give village seafood buffet a try. besides proximity, as an added incentive, locals (with nevada id and a rio club card) receive 25 percent off!\n\nthe staff was friendly, well trained and attentive. the food, however, was simply mediocre.\n\nthe headings posted above each station made little or no sense and only served as a source of amusement. the dishes in the \"latin american\" section, for example, had absolutely nothing to do with latin america. having spent several years living in chile and argentina, and being married into a chilean family, i'd like to think that i know a little something about cuisine from that part of <mark>Freshly imported catch from around the world</mark>. sorry village people...not even close! chicken wings on a skewer don't make it a brazilian churrascaria.\n \nmy real issue with this place is not the way they organize their spread or classify the fare; it is the lack of what gordon ramsey calls \"simple honest food\". every fish dish was some sort of stewed or poached jumble. i was hoping to find a station where i could get an uncomplicated grilled piece of salmon or swordfish. no such luck, not a grill in sight. everything was swimming in oil or had been boiled to death. although i'm far from a pretentious la foodie, i am no great fan of mushy mahi mahi.\n\nthe three varieties of crab legs (cold, steamed, and stir-fried) were little more than adequate. of course that did not stop me from stoking my cholesterol count. the cold crab legs were split with few claws around. this, i'm willing to concede, might not be the restaurant's fault. sometimes it is just the luck of the draw as to whom you get behind (cue the guoyue music).  seriously, after you google it, don't get mad at that last statement. you know it's true. i'm just trying to be factual and objective here...but i digress. the steamed legs were of decent size, but not particularly tasty. the chinese sweet and spicy wok-stirred crabs were the best. at least they had some flavor infused into them.\n\nas for some of the other dishes, i'm sorry to report the pale elfin lobster was past its prime, completely over-cooked, and diminutive. by good fortune i remembered to bring my reading glasses. the asian section made panda express look yummy.  and, the beef dishes were...well, let's just say, i think the cows died of old age. more than likely village seafood purchased the roast beef that the palace station and circus circus passed up as being too cheap and tough even for their customers.\n\ni cannot comment on the oysters, clams, and other assortment of crustaceans that i didn't try other than to say that most in my family seemed to enjoy them very much and left a rather large debris field behind them as proof.\n\nthe highlights, aside from the excellent service, were, the sourdough rolls and the deserts. several of the deserts were quite good, but the best of the best would have to be the gelato. i'm told they're homemade. they had about 10 different flavors. we sampled three of them at our table and each one was delightful.\n \noverall, none of us hated it...but the night is young. hopefully i won't have to amend this review in the morning!", 
            "my wife and i were exited about the prospect of having fresh seafood as advertised. we have enjoyed seafood <mark>Freshly imported catch from around the world</mark> so we have a good idea what fresh well prepared seafood should taste like. what we tasted was a substandard ill prepared presentation. an array of overcooked lackluster tasting fish. crab was plentiful and tasteless. an attempt at sushi and sashimi fell painfully short of what it should have been. sad to say but the best part of the seafood buffet was the prime rib roast. walk away from this overpriced wannabe seafood restaurant.", 
            "this place is amazing and it is absolutely my favorite seafood buffet...hands down!! \n\nthis place is every seafood lover's dream come true. anytime i want good all-u-can-eat seafood in vegas i end up here. i will admit it's not cheap ($45.00 per adult) but it is totally worth it. they have everything here from all <mark>Freshly imported catch from around the world</mark>'s oceans! \n\nthe service is also very good and the staff is very friendly. it doesn't seem to get as crowded as the carnival buffet either (the other excellent buffet on the other side of the rio).", 
            "overall quality of food was a little above average but not better than other comparable buffets that come at the 40 dollar per person cost. \nnegatives are that the raw oysters are covered in ice and most are half frozen with chunks of ice within the shell. clams are just cheap bottleneck clams and muscles are generic. people say that they offer lobster tails but don't be fooled they are the cheapest and smallest tails that i have ever had. the total meat on one tail is about the size of your thumb. you can get as many as you want however they don't have a succulent taste that is expected with lobster tails. the prime rib was pretty good but the two pieces i had were fairly fatty. \npositives are the sushi bar is made fresh and they have large pieces of fresh tuna and other whitefish. soup is really good with jambalaya, chowder, and bisque. also the salmon was very tasty. the desert section was fairly good but the gelato bar had sub par gelato quality. \nif you are in the rio <mark>Freshly imported catch from around the world</mark> buffet is a better choice unless you love seafood and want to try all they have. i in fact love seafood but many buffets like the wynn, and bellagio offer better lobster and overall better quality dishes for the same price. \nremember if you have a local id they give all locals 25% off overall dinner price and the rio card will give an additional 1 dollar off price. so remember to save and go hungry.", 
            "seafood...buffet? what more needs to be said. seems like a brilliant idea. however, it is horribly executed here.\n\nbehind the fa\\u00e7ade of a great value, they have <mark>Freshly imported catch from around the world</mark>'s best selection of below average quality seafood. basically, everything looked great, but tasted at best, average, and at worst, funky.\n\ntheir best items were the cooked ones. don't go after the enticing raw oysters. just don't. stuffed crab shells, yes. oh, and the crab legs. i guess you can't mess up steaming some crab legs.\n\nthey have a whole range of other foods grouped by ethnicity. you can check them out, but they all seem kind of the same after a few rounds. all just bland below average foods with some random seafood thrown in them.\n\nthe only thing that this place has going for it are the desserts. a rotating gelato bar? uhm, five please?\n\nbefore you fall into this trap, i recommend spending that half of your benjamin at another buffet with not only quantity but also quality."

            "my frugal meter died here!  i was with a group of people, and they told me to live a little.  why the heck did i listen to them?  i was living quite well with my money in my frugal pockets!  why, oh why did i stay and eat here?  i don't care if i did ride with them here!  i don't care if they are the only buffet with lobster, not worth the price.\n\nthis pricey eating trough has a variety of eating genres for dinner.  there is an asian section with sushi and other <mark>Extra stations with traditional buffet dishes</mark>.  there is a baja section with fajita this, tortilla that, nacho chips here, and nacho cheese there, to name a few items.  there is a mediterranean section that has a variety of items, including hummus.  of course you have to have your carving section with the turkey, ham and high end beef, cut by a chef to your liking.  \n\nthere are truly many options to this buffet, but the price makes me ill just thinking about it!  too much for even unlimited.  i realized too late that i was crazy.  for a few dollars more, i should have opted for the 24 hour, 6 buffet option.  this buffet is included in the list.  had i purchased that, i could have eaten at this buffet at night, rested, ate at another buffet in the morning, did some afternoon activities, then ate at another buffet that afternoon, then rounded off my night with another buffet for hour number 23!  run-on sentence, yes, but very logical still, frugal glee yes!  you live and you learn.  \n\nthe food on the buffet is decent enough to do the meal deal.  i don't understand gelato, but there is multiple flavors of that, along with many types of desserts to round off your meal.", 
            "the food is decent with a big variety of seafood dishes. but at 40$ a person i just didn't think it was worth it. i'd rather spend that much on 1 freshly cooked seafood dinner then all i can eat <mark>Extra stations with traditional buffet dishes</mark>."

            "i have been a long time customer at rio's village seafood buffet(i still remember the first time i came here was back in 2006) and i come here every time i'm in town. their lobster tails, snow crab legs, <mark>Creative, flavorful dishes creatively incorporate various fish</mark> dishes and gelatos are so tasty! although over the years, i have found the quality of the lobster tails to have declined a little but it won't take away my liking for this place and my craving of their lobster tails. afterall, why do i come here? i'm here really for the seafood. i have been to many buffets here in vegas, but the village seafood buffet and the bacchanal buffet at the caesar's palace remain hands down two of my favorites. if you want to go for mainly seafood and lobster tails, you should give village seafood buffet a try. on the other hand, if you want a wide variety of food selection including seafood, the bacchanal buffet is a great option, too."

            "this is my second favorite buffet at the rio.  in fact, if it wasn't for the variety of seafood options that are not available at most buffets, <mark>Hard-to-find seafood offerings, including lobster</mark>, i would not eat here at all.  reasons?  1) it is very expensive and there is always a really long wait.  2) you don't receive a locals 1/2 price like you do at carnival world.  3) the food is often just mediocre.  i love lobster but the last time i ate here it was overcooked.  the time before that it was cold.  the vultures eating there are pigs and often spill the drawn butter or make a mess of the lobster area.  also, often times you have to wait for more to come out.\n\ni will say that other than the lobster, the rest of the seafood usually tastes great but the bottom line is, if i am going to pay that much for buffet food, it better be darn good. otherwise, i could just go to joe's seafood or something similar and get my lobster prepared much better.", 
            "omg they are worst seafood village buffet new location now they have move the location to combine in the place called carnival buffet  it was the worse buffet ever  they so slow ran out the <mark>Hard-to-find seafood offerings, including lobster</mark> only fake lobster now and always ran out look tacky not ready like the older the place location all nice and neat and ready i am not coming back here anymore!!!!!"
