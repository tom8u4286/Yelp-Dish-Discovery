            "super delish & awesome service!\n\nwe took the whole family to celebrate hubby and son's bday.  i made a reservation for 6pm, but we ended up arriving at 5:30pm... the hostesses were very sweet and took us right to our table. they even offered to put the cake we brought in their walk-in to keep chilled (it was chocolate with bavarian cream)\n\nour server was summer... she was so nice & welcoming even letting us know about happy hour specials that we had a few minutes to take advantage of. who doesn't love a few bucks off their favorite glass of vino? \n\nsummer was very informative & made great recommendations for our party of 12.  \nwe started with cocktails and appetizers... meatballs, 3 kinds of <mark>Fresh-Cut Italian Fries</mark> (gorgonzola are super yummy!) & grilled prosciutto wrapped asparagus. \nfor our main dish we ordered romana i & ii, ny 22\" pepperoni & sicilian style <mark>La Regina</mark>. my favorite was the romana i, but everything was delicious!  there was so much we were on sensory overload. \n\nwe will be back... so many more pies to try!", 
            "my group and i were walking fremont, and decided to go here based on it having the best yelp reviews in the area. \nman, it was really good! our table got the diavola pizza, molinari pizza, gorgonzola <mark>Fresh-Cut Italian Fries</mark>, <mark>Spaghetti and Meatballs</mark>. \nthe diavola reminded me quite a bit of when i had it in italy, which was a welcome surprise! the arugula was fresh, and the large pepperoni slices were delicious. \nthe gorgonzola fries were tasty as well, but a little light on the cheese.\nthe molinari pizza i enjoyed a lot; it's a great mix of different meat flavors. \nour waiter was really attentive and nice -- overall, i really recommend pizza rock!", 
            "hells yeah!!! this place is so good it will ruin you! i mean that you can kiss your favorite pizza place goodnight because the flavor won't surpass this place. you will forever be disappointed in other pizza places. i live in the northwest part of town and now i will not order pizza anywhere else because it's a disappointment in comparison to how awesome pizza rock is! i have had pizza back east and this place is just as good and if not even better. even my <mark>Fresh-Cut Italian Fries</mark> give pizza rock kudos. all the pizzas are great but the best are either the slices up front or get the same pizza in the restaurant called the old new york 22\", if you're sharing. if you get the individual slices they are big so have them heat it up order a beverage or take your slice to the bar and order your drink up there. the oven for the slices and old new york is different than the one the other pizzas are made with. the atmosphere is awesome especially in the evenings they have a video dj playing thursday to sunday. if you're visiting las vegas you must go to pizza rock!!!"

            "tasty <mark>Classic Meatballs</mark>, and...\n\n5-stars for the chicago cracker thin pizza. this is the only pizza to get here imo! i've had it twice now over the course of 3 separate visits. \n\ngetting the chicago cracker thin '<mark>Old Chicago</mark>' style means it comes with: <mark><mark>Tomato Sauce</mark></mark>, mozzarella, provolone, garlic, <mark>Extra Cheese, Pepperoni, or Italian Fennel Sausage</mark>, sliced meatballs, ricotta, romano and oregano. perfect! the cracker-thin crust is spot-on and just like my favorite hole-in-the-wall pizza joint near midway airport in chicago. it comes out perfectly toasty and savory, and cut into squares as it should be. you will not feel stuffed, just satisfied.\n\nif you're up in the air as to which style pizza to get because there are so many to choose from, you gotta pick the chicago cracker thin pizza. walking through the restaurant on the way to the men's restroom and back, i wish everyone had a chicago cracker thin pizza on their pizza racks instead of the more traditional pies they chose. from the looks of it, the average person likes bready pizza with pepperoni on it. or at least that's what they think they like.\n\nchicago cracker thin. the only way i rock pizza rock.", 
            "stumbled upon this pizza joint after having some drinks on fremont so we decided to stop in. parking is either is any of the garages or on the street which is metered except on sundays and holidays.\n\nour first encounter was a group of us ordering pizza by the slice at the entrance since the restaurant itself was closed (late night). it won us over for sure!\n\nour second trip here we came for dinner and got to sit in the restaurant this time around. very nicely decorated inside, tables galore! bar is in the back of the restaurant surrounded by televisions everywhere. bathroom was nice too.\n\nthe service was great, we wanted to customize our pizza order a bit so our server pointed us in the right direction as to the type of pizza we were looking for so that it didn't cost us an arm and a leg. she was prompt at filling drinks as well!\n\nwe were already sold on the classic pepperoni pizza from our first visit so we ordered that, <mark>The Mob Boss</mark> 32 and the <mark>Classic Meatballs</mark> (a must try, the sauce is delicious)! everything came out so fresh and hot! i thought it was cool that they carry 2 sized of bottled coke. :)\n\nsome of their pizzas can get pricey but if you stick to the basics, it'll be fine!\n\ngreat pizza joint! the classic pepperoni reminds me of pizza back home on the east coast! give it a try!", 
            "we tried the margherita, <mark>New Yorker</mark>, and <mark>Cal Italia</mark>.  personally, i like the antipasti <mark>Classic Meatballs</mark>.  \n\nthe service was poor at best.  i realize it was packed so they don't get one more star taken off.  we never had water without asking and when we did ask they ignored us.  what really cost them points is seeing others come in after us get their pizza before us.  our 7 year old was already done with her <mark>Mac and Cheese</mark> before they came to check on us, only to realize we hadn't eaten.\n\nit wouldn't have been so bad if we weren't there for a birthday dinner.  the manager was sent over, he apologized and said he would put in a rush and make something special.  well all the pizzas came out burnt.  the rock hard crust had me gasping for air or water to wash it down only when i reached for the water... you guessed it, i didn't have any.\n\none last chance, happy birthday song...  nope they were too busy.   \n\nwhen it came time for the check they chraged us for an apple juice which should have come with the kids menu.  live and learn.",

            "came here after a night out on fremont street. we initially just went up to the outside window to grab slices, but ended up going inside for appetizers. one of our group was talking it up, so had to check it out. \n\nfirst off, the pizza was amazing. i got the veggie. it wasn't overly greasy, overly cheesy, etc. they didn't overdo on the crust...the crust was relatively thin. toppings were really fresh with huge baby tomatoes and spinach. big slice as well!\n\ninside of the restaurant is pretty cool. it's classy, but rock n roll at the same time. \n\ni love the 18-wheeler dj booth. i have to say, the dj kicked ass! he was playing a good mix of 90's hip hop, new wave, 90's grunge...it was perfect. however, it was a tad bit loud. i thought it was cool that instead of just music, they play music videos and throw in old snl skits. we were highly entertained. \n\nwe ordered:\n* <mark>Classic Meatballs</mark>\n* <mark>Woodfired Asparagus</mark>\n* <mark>Fried Green Beans</mark>\n\neverything was super flavorful and cooked with fresh garlic. it was all quality...like some little italian mom had just made it. everything tasted so fresh!\n\nservice was super fast and the waitress was no fuss no muss. she was busy, but made a point to get us everything really quickly. \n\nthis is really place to go after hours for a slice or a sit down!",

            "i went to pizza rock on a saturday night, mainly wanting to try it after hearing about the award winning pizza. before going, i personally thought \"rock\" as a theme for a pizza restaurant marketing world cup pizzas was strange. i suppose one gets used to the typical pizza place filled with brick veneer and recreated vintage signs. pizza rock is certainly a representation of the owners personal taste. it is poorly laid out, however. you enter into a relatively dark entrance, that is juxtaposed to an overly bright take-out bar to your right. the host's stand behind wood topped tool chests with ipads hanging from them. you would not know the they were employees if they weren't behind the chests. guest waited against the walls on chairs. it was loud, like a sports bar, with the roar of the patriots colts game. \n\nwe were told it would be a 20 minute wait, they took my phone number so they could text me when our table was ready. i thought this was a cool feature, even more cool, our wait may have only been about 5 minutes. \n\nthey sat me and my girlfriend at a table for two, it was in a very unappealing space. it kind of felt floating in space, right by the busy restroom hallway, kitchen door, and main path of travel for customers to their tables. back to how it is poorly laid out, the restaurant is overly long and narrow. i did not walk the entire thing, but the seating felt unorganized with out clear paths of movement that are not distracting to guests. many times during the meal did new parties moving to their tables walk on all sides of our small for-two table, making us feel consciously swarmed for a brief moment. \n\nenough about the place, now to the meal and service. we sat down and immediately started reading the menu, their are many many options of unique pizzas complete with the temperature they cook it atm the prices seemed fair. our caesar salad may have been a little overpriced though at $10 - but it was plenty to share. \n\nwe were not immediately greeted by a server to take a drink order, probably about 5 minutes passed before we got concerned and happened to make eye contact with someone we thought might work there. again, not dressed in any uniform or some sort, we simply notice he was talking briefly to our hostess. he asked us if we had been seen and then quickly got our drink order and server. \n\nthe server was nice and adequate, he did wear a uniform, but the service was nothing exceptional, about the standard you expect in such an establishment. i will say the food did come quick after ordering it however, and the 10% locals discount is appreciated. \n\nwe ordered a caesar salad to share and the <mark>Fried Green Beans</mark> appetizer. the caesar was good, but the dressing was a bit cashier than i prefer. the <mark>Fried Green Beans</mark> were disappointing because they were not actually fried. i was looking forward to something crunchy, maybe a bit salty but they are actually saut\\u00e9ed i believe. they were still good, just not what we were lead to believe. \n\nok, the pizza. we ordered the \"<mark>Cal Italia</mark>\" (i believe it was called) it was one of the award winning pizzas. it came fast and was delicious. the crust was airy and flaky and the fig sauce drizzled on top gave a perfect sweetness to each bite. the pizza was the perfect size to share for two after an appetizer, at about 6 medium sized slices. however, once again slightly mislead. this was a sauceless pizza, although i am pretty sure the menu said \"vine ripe tomatoes sauce\".. maybe this one was a exception for the category it was under and i overlooked this detail. \n\ni give this place 3 out of 5 stars for the whole package. the facility lacking basic design logic to make the experience comfortable and inviting. this isn't a critique on the decor and theme, but the basic layout. the service was pretty standard, i think i expect a bit more from these boutique restaurants, maybe it was an off night. i'd rate the food 4 out of 5, and would like to try more items on their menu, but i'll be in no hurry to go back. \n\ni say try it when taking a night out downtown or if visiting vegas. its a casual place to bring a group of friends or family, watch the game, and get some pizza.", 
            "i've come to pizza rock several times since it's been open and even went to their mock service right before opening. every experience i've had here has been wonderful! i've never had bad service and everything i've tried has been delicious! \nappetizers: \nfried artichoke - so good! i was shocked at how much i liked this dish because it seemed a little weird but it was delicious. \n<mark>White Wine Clams</mark> - first time i've ever tried clams before and they were really yummy. i'm not really a seafood person, but the sauce made it not too ocean-y. \n<mark>Fried Green Beans</mark>: garlic, flash fried, crunchy but not too crunchy. really good, i could eat those all day. \nmeatballs: oh my gosh. i'm not a fan of red sauce but i can't go to pizza rock without getting a side of meatballs!\n<mark>Gorgonzola & Apple</mark> salad: my favorite salad! i don't always eat all the apples because i don't typically like fruit in my salads, but the walnuts and gorgonzola with arugula and the dressing they use is ridiculous. if you get this as a main course, i would suggest asking for chicken breast in it to make it a little more dense, but it could definitely be used as a appetizer to share or as a main course for one. \n\npizzas: \n<mark>Honey Pie</mark>: perfect combination of sweet and spicy. i've had this one a few times and sometimes it's a little too much spice for my liking, but the sweetness mellows it out a little. \ncal-italia: my favorite pizza ever! i could go on and on about how delicious and amazing this pizza is. in my opinion, this is the best pizza in all of las vegas. the <mark>Balsamic Reduction</mark> is so good. it's salty, sweet, cheesy perfection. \n<mark>New Yorker</mark>: not my kind of pizza - too much meat for me. but the guys i was with when we got this one loved it. \n\ntoday i came for brunch with my mom. it was outstanding! the french toast ambrosia was out of this world. i was completely stuffed and still managed to eat all of it because it was so good! my mom got <mark>The Butcher 'All Meat'</mark> hash with scrambled egg white- it wasn't quite what we were expecting presentation wise but the flavor was excellent. overall an extremely enjoyable meal. our server, ryan (blonde hair), was fantastic! he was very friendly and knew the menu really well. he was able to answer all of my questions and was quick at bringing us what we asked for. the bottomless mimosas and sangria was great as well - i highly recommend the sangria! delicious!",

            "by far, my favorite pizza place in vegas!  not only does this place have a great vibe but the food is de-lish!  definitely try the classic meat balls and the <mark>Fried Green Beans</mark> are a no-brainer.  the <mark>Cal Italia</mark> 19 is runner up to the award winning margherita - as in world pizza cup winner in italy so get both!",

            "my daughter came into town and i put her up at the d.  we hung around the fremont street experience and when she got hungry, i googled \"gluten free\" restaurants and lo and behold, pizza rock came up because of their gluten free selections.  and it was just around the corner so we could walk there.\n\nwe arrived and we loved the ambiance.  our greeter was friendly and the waiter was prompt.  we just missed the drink special by minutes and i was kinda disappointed the waiter didn't bend the rules for us as most restaurants have done in the past if we happen to make it just after the cut off time.  \n\nmy daughter was happy to see a vegetarian gluten free pizza so we ordered that one.  the waiter was very polite, but not exactly friendly.\n\nour drinks were served promptly and we waited for the pizza while admiring the decor, including a huge truck cab next to our table.  there was a bit of a wait but we didn't mind as we were catching up with each other.  right about the time i had the thought that this was taking longer than it should, the waiter comes over and says that there was a problem with our order, and we could have a free appetizer while they cooked us up another pizza.  i thought that was very generous and we opted for the <mark>Fried Green Beans</mark>.\n\nohmygawd!  these were amazing and i am drooling as i type this. seriously, if you like <mark>Fried Green Beans</mark>, you have got to try these.\n\nas we were happily crunching on these pieces of joy  in between occasional moans of absolute contentment, the manager or owner came over, introduced himself, apologized, asked us if we liked our <mark>Fried Green Beans</mark> (which should have been obvious as our eyes were practically rolling in our heads) and then proceeded to tell us that the entire meal would be comped except our alcoholic drinks.\n\nwow!  we were happy to hear that, obviously. me especially as i had just spent a small fortune on having a great vegas time with my daughter!  and while we continued to wait, he kept us interested in his experience with micro brewed beers and gluten free beer much to the delight of my daughter, who is a connoisseur, and then he proceeded to tell us the interesting story of how pizza rock came to be.  our pizza finally arrived and he discreetly left, and once again my mouth waters as i type this.\n\ni never thought i would be a fan of gluten free pizza but this was absolutely delicious.  and i come from chicago, where chicago style pizza is a delicacy.  \n\nall in all, i am giving this place 5 stars because of the excellent food, and how a manager or owner took what could have been a negative experience and turned it into a fun and memorable evening out with my daughter.  that is a skill, and an art!  we will be back!", 
            "pizza rock is off the chart great pizza.  anytime i'm anywhere near downtown vegas, i suggest it as our dining choice.\n\nmy favorite pizza by far is the sausage and stout pizza -- it was introduced around st. patrick's day last march and hadn't been printed on the menu the last time i was in (mid-july) - but i'm hoping it has now.  absolutely amazing.\n\nmy next fave is the <mark>Honey Pie</mark> - it's the perfect combination of sweet and hot with a mixture of honey <mark>Sausage and Peppers</mark>...really good if you like a little kick in your mouth after a bite.\n\nmy friends ordered the <mark>Tomato Pie</mark> on our last visit (not being as adventurous for spice as i am) and it was also great -- very traditionally italian tasting.\n\ni've also had the mac & cheese, <mark>Fried Green Beans</mark> <mark>Clam and Garlic</mark> bread on other visits...so i can highly recommend those.  i wish i could recommend other items, but i love the above three so much that they're all i can ever bring myself to order!\n\nreally looking forward to the opening of the next restaurant in green valley because it's about 15 miles closer to my house!",

            "the skinny: awesome happy hour however the regular dinner items were only okay (3.5) service: pretty good for a pizza joint although it wasn't particularly busy when we went (4) value: amazing happy hour for the price while regular dining is a bit pricey for what it is (3.5 round up to a 4 starred review).\n\nnote about the parking: do not go inside the casino for validated parking. just park in the the grand self-parking lot across the street and the hostess at pizza rock will give you a sticker to put on your parking ticket for free parking. score!\n\nafter visiting twice, i have decided i do like pizza rock.\n\nthe first visit for dinner, i wasn't terribly impressed. we ordered the <mark>Old Chicago</mark> cracker thin crust pizza and a <mark>House Salad</mark>. \n\nthe <mark>Old Chicago</mark> pizza was okay but nothing i needed to order again. specifically, the crust is very burnt on the edges of the pizza which was off-putting. although the sausage/pepperoni/ricotta cheese combination was good, the pizza felt that it was missing something... like a hit of mushroom to kind of unify all the flavors. it was a bit greasy as well.\n\nthe <mark>House Salad</mark> is rather small with a very generic tasting balsamic dressing on top. for $6, i'd pass on this.\n\nenticed by the happy hour prices, we decided hit this joint again. we ordered the personal pizza sized molinari and the <mark>Cal Italia</mark> for $7 each and tried the <mark>Fried Green Beans</mark> for $3 and fried calamari for $5.\n\nthe <mark>Fried Green Beans</mark> were pretty good. they are not fried per se but sauteed lightly with a lot of garlic. for those who are watching their waistlines, the amount of oil on the bottom of the bowl is intimidating however. for $3, the serving size is quite generous.\n\nthe fried calamari was delicious! the calamari was soft and tender while the breading was appropriately on the lighter side. portion size was rather large. you can get this dish in either the spicy version/non-spicy version or even half and half. personally, i found the spicy version to be a little too strong for my tastes so i'll stick to the regular version.\n\nthe pizza crust was very good - slightly chewy with a nice crispy bottom which was a good change from the burnt crust on their ol' chicago.\n\nfor me, the <mark>Cal Italia</mark> was only okay - a bit too sweet due to the figs and <mark>Balsamic Reduction</mark> and needs a bit more of the gorgonzola and proscuitto to balance things out. i almost wished they hadn't reduced the balsamic vinegar to retain a bit more of the acidity to the dish.\n\nthe molinari was a great old school pizza - it's basically what they call everybody's favourite back home in canada (sausage and mushroom). the crust and sauce was great and everything just went well together. some may think that it is a little greasy (which it is - no doubt) but that comes with the territory when you serve  3 types of sausage on a pizza. so good and totally guilty pleasure.\n\noverall, this joint has a lot going for it - the variety on the menu is good and the happy hour deals are excellent. although some of the items are hit or miss, the molinari and fried calamari will have me coming back for sure. service is good if you are going during off peak hours/days (we went happy hour during the week and sunday evening at 5:30pm). overall 3.5 starred review with a bump up to 4.", 
            "afternoon for lunch and a few of us decided to check out this place because from word of mouth by other co-workers, this was getting raves about its pizza.\n\nwe had a great waitress take our order, delivered our late afternoon cocktails, and appetizers followed shortly after.\n\neverything had a great rhythm as far as getting our food.\n\nthe garlic <mark>Fried Green Beans</mark> was our shining star to kick start our appetites. \n\nthe other members of my party ordered pizza of various sorts - but i am that guy that found a kobe burger in a pizza menu!\n\nthe pizzas are amazing and so was my amazing burger!\n\nthe atmosphere is definitely rock n roll - i would definitely recommend others to come and check out this place.\n\nif you're a person who is looking for a happy hour to hangout at, kick start your evening here!",

            "the pizza menu was extensive with a variety of different styles. our pizza - the <mark>Cal Italia</mark> - was really spectacular. perfect for two. we also got the <mark>Beer Battered Fried Artichokes</mark>, which were delicious. you get two deep fried artichoke quarters - they looked like chicken drumsticks - and a tasty dipping sauce. the arugula salad with pancetta, mozzarella and tomatoes was good, but definitely large and a bit much. because the pizza came out before our salad, they comped it (salad) off our bill. \n\nthey had great beer selections on tap (i had a 20 oz. dogfish head 90 minute and hubby had the deschutes fresh squeezed ipa)  and a great happy hour (we weren't there for that though). overall the service was excellent, but the ambiance is a little... different. it's like a \"dive bar\" but it's intentional to align with the \"rock music\" theme.\n\ni would love to come back here.", 
            "i wasn't expecting much after trying grimaldis but damn, i gotta say, this place is pretty impressive. we started out with a small caesar which is weird, because the menu listed only one size, but i gotta say it was the best caesar salad i had in a very long time. i'm still dreaming of it. usually anchovies are brown/gray in color these were white. we also had the <mark>Beer Battered Fried Artichokes</mark> which looked like two pieces of fried chicken, yes two, so if your party is larger than 2, i'd suggest ordering more. it came with a thousand island looking dressing which was flavored with horse radish. after this pizza came i used this sauce for the ends of my crust. we also ordered the picante style pizza, which is a some what spicy pizza with serrano peppers, banana peppers, calabrese peppers, linguica, cholulua sauce, and chorizo. things u must know: \n\na) there's a yelp coupon if you check in here for 15% off your bill\n\nb) if you want to dine in but want slices you have to order from the front first because the front take out and the restaurant do separate things was what the waiter said. \n\nc) if you see something from the front that you like, buy it cuz it runs out.\n\nd) the front counter serves pizza with pineapples but not the back, i saw a pie with jalape\\u00f1os,pepperoni, pineapples, and dollups of ricotta that i coveted but when i got back they sold out :(. \n\ne) valet parking at the grand hotel which is located right across the street.",

            "hands down the best pizza in vegas- and it's probably not close. it breaks the mold of gangster inspired stuffy pizza joints (prevalent in vegas) where the godfather soundtrack plays on repeat all day and every pizza comes with 35lbs of cheese on it. \n\ni had not been to pizza rock before last night. i had been to tony's in sf (another location with the same owner) so i knew how good it was going to be but somehow just never got around to it- shameful i know. it is located downtown just outside of the ruckus. it is across the street from the grand hotel and casino and you can valet park there to attend the restaurant.\n\nwe made a reservation but it didn't look like it was necessary for a sunday night. as we were being lead to our table it took every bit of restraint i could muster to not snatch slices off the many delicious looking pizzas we walked by. the decor is very orange county chopper-esque and the music is a lot of rock from the 90's which is good for the newly over 30 and old crowd. also when i checked in on yelp i got a 15% of coupon so make sure you do that. \n\nthe food\n\nwe got two pizzas since we couldn't decide. we had gotten <mark>The Butcher 'All Meat'</mark> appetizer in sf and it was great but we decided to skip it and try for dessert. \n\n<mark>Cal Italia</mark>- this was the pizza we had in sf and it has haunted us ever since. it is a white style pizza with prosciutto and <mark>Sweet Fig Preserves</mark>, sprinkled with balsamic vinegar. it sounds pretty weird i know but it is insanely good.  the pizza rock version did not disappoint. \n\n<mark>The Ogden</mark>- this had olive, <mark>Goat Cheese</mark>, <mark>House Made Honey and Calabrese Sausage</mark> on a white pizza. i know what you are thinking \"two white pizzas?\"- and yes we went there. this was not quite as good as the <mark>Cal Italia</mark>- but still good. it could of been improved by adding some more <mark>Goat Cheese</mark>- some of the pieces had quite a bit, others almost none.\n\nchicken parm- i didn't get this unfortunately- someone at the table next to me did. it looked so good i strongly considered cracking his skull open like a coconut and taking it before going on the lamb. \n\nthey have so many other unique flavors of pizza i will definitely be going back in order to try as many as possible. \n\n<mark>Mud Pie</mark>- i saw someone else get this dessert and had to get it. it comes with some awesome flavored whip cream (grand marnier?) that is sort of orange tasting- highly recommend.",

            "new place in dtlv, and i'm a fan! \n\nthe place is big, but i like the layout b/c the sections have a separate-like feel that flows well. the bar is spacious, with plenty of seats and eating room. in addition to their regular dining tables, there's a separate, large dining table for large parties, and cute little intimate 2-person tables too. the decor is a sort of rock 'n roll, meets construction zone, meets french provencal (mirror, chandeliers, bathroom), but it works! i also like the little touches, like paper bags as place mats and <mark><mark>Tomato Sauce</mark></mark> cans to hold silverware. the kitchen is that exposed italian pizzeria style. i wish i could do a better job at explaining the layout, but you'll just have to go and see it.\n\nthe food is really good. the calarmari was damn near perfect. ok, i can't say a bad thing about it. it was perfectly crisp (i hate soggy calamari). there's 2 ways you can order it, traditional or calabrese style. i got half and half and both were just delicious. calabrese style is the spicier version. i got the <mark>House Salad</mark>. a basic, no frills, salad. but the lettuce and tomatoes were fresh. i was pleased. the pizza i chose was the prosciutto e pomodorini. so good! i do wish the prosciutto was a little crispy (like my favorite pizza place lucifer's does their's) but it was still a yummy pizza! everything tasted so fresh and delicious. \n\nfor dessert i got the tiramisu. ok, first i want to say, i am not a huge fan of tiramisu. i've tried it several times at different places, and it never blew me away. but during my last trip to italy with the husband, he would always get it, so it became our italian vaca thing. tiramisu at every restaurant. so i began to appreciate this dessert. back to pizza rock's tiramisu... amazing! it was a large piece, my first reaction was, \"oh i'll never finish this.\" my husband had about 3 bites of it because i couldn't stop the food beast inside me.\n\ni didn't try any of their drinks, but they do have several beers on tap, wine and a full bar.\n\nanother cool thing is they have a walk-up pizza window that people passing by outside can order pizza by the slice from. awesome!\n\nthe staff is all very friendly. service was great. i am excited about this great place so close to where i live. and i highly recommend trying it out.\n\nparking is a pain, so just expect that.",

            "the skinny: awesome happy hour however the regular dinner items were only okay (3.5) service: pretty good for a pizza joint although it wasn't particularly busy when we went (4) value: amazing happy hour for the price while regular dining is a bit pricey for what it is (3.5 round up to a 4 starred review).\n\nnote about the parking: do not go inside the casino for validated parking. just park in the the grand self-parking lot across the street and the hostess at pizza rock will give you a sticker to put on your parking ticket for free parking. score!\n\nafter visiting twice, i have decided i do like pizza rock.\n\nthe first visit for dinner, i wasn't terribly impressed. we ordered the <mark>Old Chicago</mark> cracker thin crust pizza and a <mark>House Salad</mark>. \n\nthe <mark>Old Chicago</mark> pizza was okay but nothing i needed to order again. specifically, the crust is very burnt on the edges of the pizza which was off-putting. although the sausage/pepperoni/ricotta cheese combination was good, the pizza felt that it was missing something... like a hit of mushroom to kind of unify all the flavors. it was a bit greasy as well.\n\nthe <mark>House Salad</mark> is rather small with a very generic tasting balsamic dressing on top. for $6, i'd pass on this.\n\nenticed by the happy hour prices, we decided hit this joint again. we ordered the personal pizza sized molinari and the <mark>Cal Italia</mark> for $7 each and tried the <mark>Fried Green Beans</mark> for $3 and fried calamari for $5.\n\nthe <mark>Fried Green Beans</mark> were pretty good. they are not fried per se but sauteed lightly with a lot of garlic. for those who are watching their waistlines, the amount of oil on the bottom of the bowl is intimidating however. for $3, the serving size is quite generous.\n\nthe fried calamari was delicious! the calamari was soft and tender while the breading was appropriately on the lighter side. portion size was rather large. you can get this dish in either the spicy version/non-spicy version or even half and half. personally, i found the spicy version to be a little too strong for my tastes so i'll stick to the regular version.\n\nthe pizza crust was very good - slightly chewy with a nice crispy bottom which was a good change from the burnt crust on their ol' chicago.\n\nfor me, the <mark>Cal Italia</mark> was only okay - a bit too sweet due to the figs and <mark>Balsamic Reduction</mark> and needs a bit more of the gorgonzola and proscuitto to balance things out. i almost wished they hadn't reduced the balsamic vinegar to retain a bit more of the acidity to the dish.\n\nthe molinari was a great old school pizza - it's basically what they call everybody's favourite back home in canada (sausage and mushroom). the crust and sauce was great and everything just went well together. some may think that it is a little greasy (which it is - no doubt) but that comes with the territory when you serve  3 types of sausage on a pizza. so good and totally guilty pleasure.\n\noverall, this joint has a lot going for it - the variety on the menu is good and the happy hour deals are excellent. although some of the items are hit or miss, the molinari and fried calamari will have me coming back for sure. service is good if you are going during off peak hours/days (we went happy hour during the week and sunday evening at 5:30pm). overall 3.5 starred review with a bump up to 4.", 
            "ok this is hands down the best pizza place ever. first time here. on vacation. the <mark>House Salad</mark> was amazing. fresh. even the ranch and balsamic dressing was delicious. the pizza was outstanding! get it with extra sauce on the side, even better. the service was the best. our waitress was so sweet and always checked in on us. it didn't take very long to get the food maybe 20 minutes tops and it was pretty busy. they have a bar and plenty of tv to watch your sports. bathrooms are small but very nice and clean. it's located near the fremont experience. i will definitely be coming here again i can't wait to try more what's on their menu. the downside though of course around the area there's a lot of homeless people and they will bug you for money.", 
            "i always come here when i visit vegas. they have the best margherita pizza. the cheese tastes fresh every time. the <mark>House Salad</mark> i recommend. also don't forget the garlic garlic bread <mark>Spaghetti and Meatballs</mark>. i was not a meatball fan but pizza rock cooks them perfectly and so flavorful. seriously, i would recommend this place. my family lives here in vegas and i definitely want them to experience this culinary delight.", 
            "i have been to the new location inside the green valley casino three times. service at the bar is good, rapid and friendly despite the fact the place is busy. good pizzas, pasta dishes and <mark>House Salad</mark>. prices are reasonable, particularly considering it is inside a casino. large number of big tv screens. good experience.", 
            "we left the reggae festival at the amphitheater after 11 pm, so i checked yelp to see what restaurants were open.  i was shocked to find that so many downtown joints close at 10.  on a saturday night in summer??  pizza rock was open, and since i hadn't been at the yelp elite shindigs held there, it was definitely on my bucket list.  \n\nthe front of the restaurant looked like the kind you'd find on any street corner in nyc, so i was surprised by the size of the dining room in back.  dark. loud.  dark's not a bad thing, but loud's another story.  i liked a lot of the music they being played (live dj), but not the songs that were so thunderous that they reverberated through my body as if i were being tased.\n\nwe were there at happy hour time, so we took advantage of that.  we shared a <mark>House Salad</mark> (not on the hh menu) and a <mark>Frank's True Italian (Thin Crust)</mark> personal pizza.  hubby ordered <mark>The Butcher 'All Meat'</mark>; we didn't share those because i'm not a fan of balls when they're the traditional beef, pork and veal combo.  i know they're supposed to be the best, but it's just not my thing.  the sauce, though, was divine, and there was enough of it to make a meal.  it may well be the best sauce i've ever tasted.  he loved the whole thing so much he ordered a foursome for $4 to take home.  and i put some of that sauce on my pizza, which doesn't come with the red stuff.\n\nso why, almost alone among yelp elites, do i give this only three stars?  after all, the table was comfortable, the service was terrific, the yogi berra quote stenciled on the wall was hysterical, and the hh prices reasonable.  aside from the blasting music, this is, after all, a pizza joint, one that's revered by many.  and the answer is:\n\ni didn't like the pizza!!!\n\nas born and bred <mark>New Yorker</mark>, we know that no matter how good the toppings, pizza needs a crispy crust.  this was soft, and weird, almost like the boxed stuff in the supermarket frozen aisle.  i took home the couple of leftover slices, hoping they'd crisp up in the toaster oven, but they didn't.  \n\ni wanted and expected to love pizza rock, but in my book it was only okay.", 
            "yuuuuuuuuummmmmmmy!! celebrated my birthday here :) started with two <mark>House Salad</mark> and both pizza's we got were delicious! we got the fratellanza and the <mark>Old Chicago</mark>. they were perfect because the fratellanza was a thick crust pie with the perfect amount of toppings...and the crust was the best. amazing! the <mark>Old Chicago</mark> is crispy thin and just the right amount of cheese. \n\nthere were 6 in our party and we had left overs (perfect for tomorrow).\n\nwe finished with the tiramisu \n\nthanks pizza rock! we'll be back!", 
            "i start this review by letting everyone know that i was the idiot that went to a pizza place and did not order pizza. \n\nsince i was staying nearby on a business trip i decided to give pizza rock a try after seeing lots of good reviews. unfortunately for a single person their pizzas were too large and i wasn't able to take any back with me. instead i ordered a <mark>House Salad</mark> and meat <mark>Mac and Cheese</mark> board. the salad was a salad, nothing special to report. i've ordered lots of charcuterie <mark>Mac and Cheese</mark> boards before and let me tell you the portions of prosciutto, cheeses, and salami were huge! not to mention there were two massive pieces of bread. it was safe to say i barely put a dent in it. \n\nthe bartender was super nice and let me know they do personal pizza for happy hour m-f 3-6 & 10-12 (i wish i would have known sooner). i'd love to come back and try a pie because they look amazing. next time...", 
            "food and service was great. menu a little weird. from what i gather you can't really modify anything on the menu.  you have to look for something that appeals to you. we each had a <mark>House Salad</mark> and shared the pepperoni stromboli.  sunday acoustic performer was fantastic. i applaud him for his variety of music.", 
            "bad pun but this place really does rock. the <mark>House Salad</mark> is excellent with lots and vegetables and fresh croutons. the margherita pizza is apparently certified as official by italy and they're limited to making 77 a day. not sure if that's true but it's a must try, not too much cheese, just classic pizza taste without being too greasy or heavy. they have a jalape\\u00f1o beer on tap too, it's interesting and worth a try. be sure to check in on yelp for 15% off your bill."

            "today is day one of the week long grand opening for pizza rock!  so excited to hear another new establishment has moved downtown!  what's even better was i heard they were showcasing their menu for the public and fine tune the overall experience for the actual opening on saturday.  originally, we heard you needed reservations to eat there for free this week, however, a coworker mentioned to us that folks working downtown will be able to roll in without reservations and be seated for dinner.  this was a perfect opportunity for a couple of us to have a nice dinner after a hard day's work!\n\nthe restaurant is on the corner of ogden and 3rd st, attached to the mob bar and triple george saloon.  right away, you notice the huge \"pizza rock\" sign from the outside, bordered by flame artwork.  when you enter, there's a nice seating area with a very friendly hostess station.  everyone was super excited to greet you and take your name.  because of the grand opening, we were able to walk around the restaurant and take a look at the decor.  to the right of the hostess stand was the pizza takeout window with a viewable kitchen.  pretty cool.  after the seating area, the main focal point of the restaurant is the life sized semi truck in the middle of the dining area.  super cool!  it serves as a multi purpose art.  aside from the obvious attention grabber, it's the new dj station and serves to break up the bar area and dining area.  wow! the bar is huge and gorgeous!  lots of metal art accents around it.  lots of exposed brick around the restaurant.  they even have little private coves for seating in the dining area if you want to entertain that romantic date or have an intimate family dinner.  lots going on and it all seems to work.  \n\nwhen we were greeted by our server, shirley, we were informed of a couple of things:  they didn't have pasta, they didn't have bread, they didn't have sausage and they didn't have steak.  kind of bummed about it but everything else was free so i couldn't really complain.  shirley was a bit flustered as i expected on day one.  she quoted the wrong price for wine, ordered our food at different times which resulted in a lot of waiting and found herself making multiple trips to the table, because of the lack of efficiency.  i completely understand.  first day jitters are a given.  she had a great personality and that ended up going a long way in my book.\n\nfor dinner, here's what we got:\n\n<mark>Classic Caesar</mark>, normally for $10.00:  hearts of romaine, homemade caesar dressing, house croutons and shaved pieces of parmigiano-reggiano.  definitely a shareable dish.  i think this could comfortable feed 3 people as their first course.  lots of fresh ingredients, but i didn't have a few issues with this salad.  the croutons were way too toasted and very crunchy.  the dressing, as being the star of the dish was way too tangy.  they made it with a lot of anchovies.  now i'm a huge fan of homemade caesar dressing but this was way too overpowered with anchovies.\n\nmargherita pizza, normally for $15.00:  this pizza was a 2007 world pizza cup winner in italy!  hand mixed dough using imported flour and proofed in wood boxed imported from italy.  wow.  san marzano tomatoes, mozzarella cheese, basil, extra virgin olive oil and <mark>Sea Salt</mark>.  the dough from the crust was amazing but the crust turned out a little burnt and had a slightly bitter taste.  the sauce was one of the stars of the show, nice and creamy.  mozzarella was flavorful and there were a lot for a margherita, which was awesome.  the only critique was the basil.  not enough to taste that element which makes a great pie. \n\ndowntown pizza, normally for $19.00:  wow, lots going on!  mozzarella, pepperoni, salami, bacon, chives, mushrooms, read onions, bell peppers, olives, <mark><mark>Extra Cheese, Pepperoni, or Italian Fennel Sausage</mark></mark> and <mark><mark>Cherry Tomato</mark></mark>.  think of it as an upgraded supreme.  with all these ingredients, there was no lack of flavor!  wow loved the flavor punch.  my only feedback was the crust was too thin for this pizza.  it couldn't support the amount of toppings.  it became soggy real fast and we ended up losing a lot of the toppings on the table.  \n\nmanhattan calzone, normally for $12.00:  stuffed with meatballs, mozzarella, ricotta <mark>Clam and Garlic</mark>.  as my friend put it, you would pay 12 bucks f<mark>Classic Pepperoni or Cheese</mark> and bread.  lots of cheese.  omg, it was everywhere.  i personally don't think ricotta is needed.  maybe use a lot more meat to balance out the cheese.  holy cheese!  \n\nduring this week, all menu food items are free.  our entire bill was comped which was the best part of the evening.  please remember to tip your servers great!  this review, i've created, is to give the best and most valuable feedback, so this place thrives downtown.  just the ambiance alone will take them far.  i will certainly be back to try other items of the menu.  next time, i'm hitting the steak and pasta hard!", 
            "their pizza is out of this world. that's all you need to know.\n\nmy first visit was during yelp helps week and it was a great setting to try this eatery since there were so many of us, which meant that we had the opportunity to try so many different pies (of course, that also meant we were stuffed!). that night, i tried eight of their pies, a couple appetizers, desserts, and a cocktail. everything was so good that i returned just four days later with my fiance and friend hally!\n\nduring my return visit, i had to order the margherita ($16) again. the dough is hand-mixed with san felice flour and proofed in neapolitan wood boxes, then it's topped with san marzano tomatoes, mozzarella, fior di latte, basil, evoo, and <mark>Sea Salt</mark>. finally, it's baked in a 900-degree wood stefano ferrara oven. it's limited to 73 pies daily (although i heard they've gotten no where near that amount yet) and it won the world pizza cup in naples, italy. true neopolitan pizza! \n\nthe three of us also shared the downtown ($19): pepperoni, molinari salami, bacon, chives, mushrooms, red onions, bell peppers, <mark>Black Olives</mark>, <mark><mark>Extra Cheese, Pepperoni, or Italian Fennel Sausage</mark></mark>, <mark><mark>Cherry Tomato</mark></mark>; which is one of their \"american originals\" pizzas that all feature <mark><mark>Tomato Sauce</mark></mark>, mozzarella, and a rustic medium crust, baked in a gas brick oven at 550 degrees. as well as the <mark>Honey Pie</mark> ($17): quail hollow farm honey, calabrese peppers, <mark>Green Onions</mark>, mozzarella, piave cheese, fried <mark><mark>Caramelized Onions</mark></mark>, serrano peppers; one of their \"california\" pizzas that use caputo flour and baked in a 900-degree wood fire oven. \n\nthe downtown reminded me of a \"supreme/deluxe\" pizza, but definitely better. i had tried the <mark>Honey Pie</mark> during the first visit and although it wasn't one of my favorites that evening, i came to appreciate its flavors the second time around. i also tried their <mark>Classic Caesar</mark> salad ($10) and it was tasty. for drinks, i tried the strawberry fields martini ($9.50): stoli strawberry, strawberry puree and a hint of mint and hally ordered the moscow mule ($12): stoli vodka, ginger beer, and fresh squeezed lemon juice. both really delicious cocktails. \n\nfrom both visits, my favorite pizzas are the margherita, <mark>Honey Pie</mark>, and <mark>New Yorker</mark> and i absolutely loved the sweet nothing cocktail, so good. i didn't care for the <mark>Calamari Fritti</mark>, rosemary garlic fries, or the mastunicola pizza. anyway, i could eat that margherita pizza every day. it's that good. i have to keep telling myself to not order it, just so i can try their other delicious concoctions (i have my eyes on the <mark>Pizza Campari</mark>, <mark>Clam and Garlic</mark>, and proscuitto e pomodorini). hands down, definitely my favorite pizza joint now (sorry grimaldi's). but seriously, award-winning pies, five different pizza ovens, quality ingredients - you're convinced right?\n\nparking is best on the surrounding streets like on casino center blvd (meters take credit cards, yay, but you can only pay hourly at $1/hour) or free valet at the downtown grand (super easy and close). oh, and don't forget your locals discount!! win.", 
            "i went to pizza rock with high expectations, based on some articles and reviews i had read, and the fact that it features international award-winning pizza.  but,  unfortunately, those expectations were not entirely met.\n\nitalian wedding soup was very good spicy and hearty soup, but nothing like traditional italian wedding soup.  it was more like minestrone with medium-sized meatballs, carrots, celery, tomatoes, ditalini noodles, and basil.  i was mostly pleased with a <mark>Classic Caesar</mark> salad that sported a good light caesar dressing with a little kick to it and a little sour flavoring, cold romaine leaves, and lemony pieces of parmesan sheets.  but it was in the all-important pizza department that i was somewhat disappointed.\n\na three cheese & ham pizza with extra cheese was very good except for the parmesan powder tossed on top.  and the internationally recognized margherita pizza was excellent.  no complaints there!  but, with respect to the <mark>New Yorker</mark>, which was voted the best traditional pizza in the world, i felt that the ricotta cheese and <mark><mark>Tomato Sauce</mark></mark> were overpowering and in too much supply, compared with the amount of sliced mozzarella, sliced house link sausage, garlic, <mark>Sausage and Peppers</mark> that shared the stage; and the crust was much thinner than i prefer.  \n\noverall, from my single experience, although the margherita pizza prepared here can definitely hold its own, even in the las vegas valley alone i would rank the other types of pizza i tried here behind dom demarco's, cosmopolitan's secret pizza, metro pizza, settebello's, biaggio's, and enzo's.\n\nthe place has a nice spacious and informal ambiance, although it is rather dark inside.  besides a large bar, white butcher paper is spread on white formica and black-edged tables.  our server allie provided friendly and very helpful service.  \n\nthe pizza sampled here was not at all bad.  it just wasn't as great as i thought it would be.\n\n3-1/2 stars overall!"

            "i've come to pizza rock several times since it's been open and even went to their mock service right before opening. every experience i've had here has been wonderful! i've never had bad service and everything i've tried has been delicious! \nappetizers: \nfried artichoke - so good! i was shocked at how much i liked this dish because it seemed a little weird but it was delicious. \n<mark>White Wine Clams</mark> - first time i've ever tried clams before and they were really yummy. i'm not really a seafood person, but the sauce made it not too ocean-y. \n<mark>Fried Green Beans</mark>: garlic, flash fried, crunchy but not too crunchy. really good, i could eat those all day. \nmeatballs: oh my gosh. i'm not a fan of red sauce but i can't go to pizza rock without getting a side of meatballs!\n<mark>Gorgonzola & Apple</mark> salad: my favorite salad! i don't always eat all the apples because i don't typically like fruit in my salads, but the walnuts and gorgonzola with arugula and the dressing they use is ridiculous. if you get this as a main course, i would suggest asking for chicken breast in it to make it a little more dense, but it could definitely be used as a appetizer to share or as a main course for one. \n\npizzas: \n<mark>Honey Pie</mark>: perfect combination of sweet and spicy. i've had this one a few times and sometimes it's a little too much spice for my liking, but the sweetness mellows it out a little. \ncal-italia: my favorite pizza ever! i could go on and on about how delicious and amazing this pizza is. in my opinion, this is the best pizza in all of las vegas. the <mark>Balsamic Reduction</mark> is so good. it's salty, sweet, cheesy perfection. \n<mark>New Yorker</mark>: not my kind of pizza - too much meat for me. but the guys i was with when we got this one loved it. \n\ntoday i came for brunch with my mom. it was outstanding! the french toast ambrosia was out of this world. i was completely stuffed and still managed to eat all of it because it was so good! my mom got <mark>The Butcher 'All Meat'</mark> hash with scrambled egg white- it wasn't quite what we were expecting presentation wise but the flavor was excellent. overall an extremely enjoyable meal. our server, ryan (blonde hair), was fantastic! he was very friendly and knew the menu really well. he was able to answer all of my questions and was quick at bringing us what we asked for. the bottomless mimosas and sangria was great as well - i highly recommend the sangria! delicious!",

            "cannot say enough good things about this place!  we are in dt vegas 3 to 4 times a year and always make a few stops at pizza rock.  my husband loves the gluten free pizza.  we always make sure to do the acoustic brunch for the $10 bottomless mimosas.  when traveling with our 9 yr old we have done the kids in the kitchen and it was wonderful!  other favorites are the <mark>Fried Green Beans</mark>, garlic bread, margarita pizza and the <mark>Gorgonzola & Apple</mark> salad.  great beer selection, wish they had more gf beer or ciders to pick from."

            "their pizza is out of this world. that's all you need to know.\n\nmy first visit was during yelp helps week and it was a great setting to try this eatery since there were so many of us, which meant that we had the opportunity to try so many different pies (of course, that also meant we were stuffed!). that night, i tried eight of their pies, a couple appetizers, desserts, and a cocktail. everything was so good that i returned just four days later with my fiance and friend hally!\n\nduring my return visit, i had to order the margherita ($16) again. the dough is hand-mixed with san felice flour and proofed in neapolitan wood boxes, then it's topped with san marzano tomatoes, mozzarella, fior di latte, basil, evoo, and <mark>Sea Salt</mark>. finally, it's baked in a 900-degree wood stefano ferrara oven. it's limited to 73 pies daily (although i heard they've gotten no where near that amount yet) and it won the world pizza cup in naples, italy. true neopolitan pizza! \n\nthe three of us also shared the downtown ($19): pepperoni, molinari salami, bacon, chives, mushrooms, red onions, bell peppers, <mark>Black Olives</mark>, <mark><mark>Extra Cheese, Pepperoni, or Italian Fennel Sausage</mark></mark>, <mark><mark>Cherry Tomato</mark></mark>; which is one of their \"american originals\" pizzas that all feature <mark><mark>Tomato Sauce</mark></mark>, mozzarella, and a rustic medium crust, baked in a gas brick oven at 550 degrees. as well as the <mark>Honey Pie</mark> ($17): quail hollow farm honey, calabrese peppers, <mark>Green Onions</mark>, mozzarella, piave cheese, fried <mark><mark>Caramelized Onions</mark></mark>, serrano peppers; one of their \"california\" pizzas that use caputo flour and baked in a 900-degree wood fire oven. \n\nthe downtown reminded me of a \"supreme/deluxe\" pizza, but definitely better. i had tried the <mark>Honey Pie</mark> during the first visit and although it wasn't one of my favorites that evening, i came to appreciate its flavors the second time around. i also tried their <mark>Classic Caesar</mark> salad ($10) and it was tasty. for drinks, i tried the strawberry fields martini ($9.50): stoli strawberry, strawberry puree and a hint of mint and hally ordered the moscow mule ($12): stoli vodka, ginger beer, and fresh squeezed lemon juice. both really delicious cocktails. \n\nfrom both visits, my favorite pizzas are the margherita, <mark>Honey Pie</mark>, and <mark>New Yorker</mark> and i absolutely loved the sweet nothing cocktail, so good. i didn't care for the <mark>Calamari Fritti</mark>, rosemary garlic fries, or the mastunicola pizza. anyway, i could eat that margherita pizza every day. it's that good. i have to keep telling myself to not order it, just so i can try their other delicious concoctions (i have my eyes on the <mark>Pizza Campari</mark>, <mark>Clam and Garlic</mark>, and proscuitto e pomodorini). hands down, definitely my favorite pizza joint now (sorry grimaldi's). but seriously, award-winning pies, five different pizza ovens, quality ingredients - you're convinced right?\n\nparking is best on the surrounding streets like on casino center blvd (meters take credit cards, yay, but you can only pay hourly at $1/hour) or free valet at the downtown grand (super easy and close). oh, and don't forget your locals discount!! win.", 
            "we came here on a thursday evening and ordered \n1. <mark>Calamari Fritti</mark>, 13\n- traditional or calabrese style with calabrese aioli and marinara dipping sauces \n2. american  original - downtown, 20 \n- mozzarella, pepperoni, molinari salami, bacon, sahhlots, mushrooms, red onions, bell peppers, <mark>Black Olives</mark>, <mark><mark>Extra Cheese, Pepperoni, or Italian Fennel Sausage</mark></mark>, <mark><mark>Cherry Tomato</mark></mark>\n3. soda, unlimited refills, 3\nfor 7 (used the living social deal - $29 for $8 beer, antipasti, and pizza (excludes ny22\")\n\n- parking is pretty lame. we tried binions because they have free parking with validation, but they took out the validation next the cashiers! fail. so there practically isn't anymore free parking on the strip. you gotta eat at their restaurant or actively gamble. $8 for 1.5hrs. shiet...\n- got in around 9pm, seated in a few minutes. sat in the back, next to the bar, right next to a speaker, great place to have a screaming conversation.\n- ran out of sicilian style dough. just our luck. \"just served the last one 15 min ago.\" i guess if we came earlier, we wouldn't have had to deal with that problem. we actually wanted to order <mark>The Mob Boss</mark> pizza instead because the crust is thicker with sicilian style. i'm not much of a fan of \"the potato chip like pizza\" or should i say thin crust. haha \n-because we sat next to a speaker, our server, chelsei, couldn't really hear us over the music. after several ahem, excuse meess....one of them got through, and she handed us utensils and napkins after we got our antipasti. who eats calamari with a fork and towel anyway? haha. come on now...anyway, she was very good at drink refills and attentive thereafter. \n- the calamari was great. we got it half and half. i recommend it bc after i ate a few spicy, i needed to balance it out with one regular. spicy one or calabrese style tasted better. chelsei hooked it up with dat extra dip doe. haha. needed that for the extra dunkers na mmm saying. lol. \n- the downtown was fresh. loved the <mark><mark>Cherry Tomato</mark></mark>, so red. 6 slices. didn't like the uncooked onions. peeled off. wood fire pizza nom! \n\nbreak down of the living social deal...\n- so if you choose the most expensive antipasti, which is  the calamari at $13 and the most expensive pizza, romana, at $35, get the beer $8, then technically, you can get the saving at 48%. \n- i probably should have just saved the deal for another day and just used the yelp check-in promo of 15% off."

            "today is day one of the week long grand opening for pizza rock!  so excited to hear another new establishment has moved downtown!  what's even better was i heard they were showcasing their menu for the public and fine tune the overall experience for the actual opening on saturday.  originally, we heard you needed reservations to eat there for free this week, however, a coworker mentioned to us that folks working downtown will be able to roll in without reservations and be seated for dinner.  this was a perfect opportunity for a couple of us to have a nice dinner after a hard day's work!\n\nthe restaurant is on the corner of ogden and 3rd st, attached to the mob bar and triple george saloon.  right away, you notice the huge \"pizza rock\" sign from the outside, bordered by flame artwork.  when you enter, there's a nice seating area with a very friendly hostess station.  everyone was super excited to greet you and take your name.  because of the grand opening, we were able to walk around the restaurant and take a look at the decor.  to the right of the hostess stand was the pizza takeout window with a viewable kitchen.  pretty cool.  after the seating area, the main focal point of the restaurant is the life sized semi truck in the middle of the dining area.  super cool!  it serves as a multi purpose art.  aside from the obvious attention grabber, it's the new dj station and serves to break up the bar area and dining area.  wow! the bar is huge and gorgeous!  lots of metal art accents around it.  lots of exposed brick around the restaurant.  they even have little private coves for seating in the dining area if you want to entertain that romantic date or have an intimate family dinner.  lots going on and it all seems to work.  \n\nwhen we were greeted by our server, shirley, we were informed of a couple of things:  they didn't have pasta, they didn't have bread, they didn't have sausage and they didn't have steak.  kind of bummed about it but everything else was free so i couldn't really complain.  shirley was a bit flustered as i expected on day one.  she quoted the wrong price for wine, ordered our food at different times which resulted in a lot of waiting and found herself making multiple trips to the table, because of the lack of efficiency.  i completely understand.  first day jitters are a given.  she had a great personality and that ended up going a long way in my book.\n\nfor dinner, here's what we got:\n\n<mark>Classic Caesar</mark>, normally for $10.00:  hearts of romaine, homemade caesar dressing, house croutons and shaved pieces of parmigiano-reggiano.  definitely a shareable dish.  i think this could comfortable feed 3 people as their first course.  lots of fresh ingredients, but i didn't have a few issues with this salad.  the croutons were way too toasted and very crunchy.  the dressing, as being the star of the dish was way too tangy.  they made it with a lot of anchovies.  now i'm a huge fan of homemade caesar dressing but this was way too overpowered with anchovies.\n\nmargherita pizza, normally for $15.00:  this pizza was a 2007 world pizza cup winner in italy!  hand mixed dough using imported flour and proofed in wood boxed imported from italy.  wow.  san marzano tomatoes, mozzarella cheese, basil, extra virgin olive oil and <mark>Sea Salt</mark>.  the dough from the crust was amazing but the crust turned out a little burnt and had a slightly bitter taste.  the sauce was one of the stars of the show, nice and creamy.  mozzarella was flavorful and there were a lot for a margherita, which was awesome.  the only critique was the basil.  not enough to taste that element which makes a great pie. \n\ndowntown pizza, normally for $19.00:  wow, lots going on!  mozzarella, pepperoni, salami, bacon, chives, mushrooms, read onions, bell peppers, olives, <mark><mark>Extra Cheese, Pepperoni, or Italian Fennel Sausage</mark></mark> and <mark><mark>Cherry Tomato</mark></mark>.  think of it as an upgraded supreme.  with all these ingredients, there was no lack of flavor!  wow loved the flavor punch.  my only feedback was the crust was too thin for this pizza.  it couldn't support the amount of toppings.  it became soggy real fast and we ended up losing a lot of the toppings on the table.  \n\nmanhattan calzone, normally for $12.00:  stuffed with meatballs, mozzarella, ricotta <mark>Clam and Garlic</mark>.  as my friend put it, you would pay 12 bucks f<mark>Classic Pepperoni or Cheese</mark> and bread.  lots of cheese.  omg, it was everywhere.  i personally don't think ricotta is needed.  maybe use a lot more meat to balance out the cheese.  holy cheese!  \n\nduring this week, all menu food items are free.  our entire bill was comped which was the best part of the evening.  please remember to tip your servers great!  this review, i've created, is to give the best and most valuable feedback, so this place thrives downtown.  just the ambiance alone will take them far.  i will certainly be back to try other items of the menu.  next time, i'm hitting the steak and pasta hard!", 
            "items selected:\n\nmargherita - 900f wood - napoletana with san marzano, mozzarella, fior di latte, basil, olive oil, <mark>Sea Salt</mark>\ncal-italia - gas brick - asiago, mozzarella, gorgonzola, fig, prosciutto, parmigiano-reggiano, balsamic\n<mark>Quail Egg White Rose Potato Guanciale</mark> - 900f wood - mozzarella, white rose potatoes, chorizo, pork cheek, rosemary, fromage blanc, calabrese peppers, lavender <mark>Sea Salt</mark>\nromana iii - electric brick - prosciutto/arugula/parmigiano, white cream/<mark>Chopped Garlic</mark>/meatball/olive oil, gorgonzola/date/pecan/apple/honey/nutella\nfarmer's market pizza - 900f wood - pumpkin puree, cinnamon, brown sugar, bacon, marshmallow\napple calzone - brown sugar, cinnamon, caramel, vanilla gelato\n<mark>Pecan Turnover</mark> - light puff pastry, maple pecan, crunch, coffee ice cream\n<mark>Mud Pie</mark> - oreo cookie crust, chocolate ganache, coffee vanilla bean ice cream, hot fudge, caramel, house made whipped cream\n \nhaving repeatedly neglected to visit tony's pizza napoletana in san francisco in favor of places like una pizzeria, pizzeria delfina, zero zero, and others i was admittedly intrigued when the well awarded chef opted to set up shop in downtown las vegas at pizza rock - the swanky new digs, multiple televisions, and guitar hero worthy playlist a far cry from the eponymous bay area location even though the multiple oven and top notch sourcing concepts remained intact - and it was with all those things in mind that myself and five others descended on the restaurant for a tasting of sizeable proportions, a total of 4.5 pizzas and three desserts served over the course of just over two hours with hit-and-miss results.  a surprisingly large space, literally big enough to park a truck, it was an early arrival that assured us use of the large private dining room and with excellent service from both the general manager plus an enthusiastic young waiter it would not be long before our pizzas started to arrive and brought out in three separate courses it was with the signatures that we began, the \"limited\" margherita proving cool to the touch and shockingly bland despite both excellent char and chew to the crust while the cal-italia proved far superior with a crunchy, toothsome crust more than able to stand up to a bevy  of toppings both sweet and savory, acidic and creamy.  moving next to the interesting yet overly complicated and entirely too spicy quail egg selection it was at last the \"3-course\" romana with its cracker crisp crust and well-paired toppings that wowed me most - the central third particularly well done with the rich meatballs nicely balanced by light cream and ample garlic, though the sweet selection was certainly not lacking in contrast or flavor either.  moving last to a gifted half of the farmer's market pizza, unfortunately overloaded with cinnamon just as the quail egg had been with spice, and finally to a trio of desserts where only the delicate <mark>Pecan Turnover</mark> would prove either inspired or memorable i think it is safe to say that the key to enjoying a meal at pizza rock is to simply embrace the concept and realize that \"everything to everyone\" and \"do one thing and do it well\" are very different mantras; the former definitely improved by a group of good people, excellent service, and (at least in this case) fond memories of 80's and 90's rock ballads.", 
            "pizza overload!  so many different pies...different ovens...different toppings...no time for all that!\n\ncame with a group of yelpers with big appetites, so we were able to blast our way through quite a bit on the menu!\n\nmy favorite by far was the cal-italia ($18): asiago, mozzarella, imported gorgonzola, sweet fig preserve, prosciutto di parma, parmigiano-reggiano & <mark>Balsamic Reduction</mark>. this was excellent and the highlight of the meal for me! great mix of sweet, savory and vinegar/acidic flavors.  highly recommended :)\n\nanother great choice would be the margherita ($16): san marzano tomatoes, mozzarella fior di latte, basil, evoo and <mark>Sea Salt</mark>. honestly, this was probably the first enjoyable margheria i've had! not usually a fan of this style pie.  whatever they do differently here, i enjoyed...but you may not for the same reasons.\n\n<mark>Quail Egg White Rose Potato Guanciale</mark> ($18): mozzarella, white rose potatoes, chorizo, pork cheek, rosemary, fromage blanc, calabrese peppers & lavender <mark>Sea Salt</mark>. this was surprisingly spicy...a bit over the top, but still enjoyable.  order it knowing it's actually spicy, and you'll do just fine.\n\nromana iii ($32): 1) <mark>Sweet Fig Preserves</mark>, prosciutto, gorgonzola & <mark>Balsamic Reduction</mark>. 2) ricotta, garlic, basil, linguisa & <mark>Piquante Peppers</mark>. 3) gorgonzola, dates & pecans, and <mark>Apples, Honey, Nutella</mark>. interesting combinations here...the only one that didn't really satisfy was the middle portion. a bit spendy, but it's huge and serves 2-4 people.  i'd pass on this one next visit.\n\nfor dessert, we also tried quite a bit.  the best imo was the <mark>Pecan Turnover</mark> : light puff pastry, maple pecan, crunch & coffee ice cream. this was pretty tasty...probably the most enjoyable dessert we tried. came out piping hot too...yum :)\n\napple calzone : brown sugar, cinnamon, caramel & vanilla gelato. this is served with 2 calzones...pretty good overall but nothing extraordinary. \n\nmarket pizza : pumpkin puree, cinnamon, brown sugar, bacon & marshmallows. not really my kind of dessert...perhaps if you are a pumpkin lover?\n\n<mark>Mud Pie</mark> : oreo cookie crust, chocolate ganache, coffee vanilla bean ice cream, hot fudge, caramel & house made whipped cream. this was very frozen...hard as a rock. i enjoyed the cookie crust though. \n\nso it's a hit or miss kinda spot for me.  depending on what you order, your results will vary...for better and worse.\n\npics!",

            "i just to had to come back here with my fam especially after sampling some of their goodies from a cmye just days before.\n\nso we started with 3 pretty nice sized meatballs for 6 bucks. should of got the 6 for 10 deal because <mark>The Butcher 'All Meat'</mark> were some of the tastiest chunks of beef i have had in a very long time. the marinara sauce that it sits in might as well have been gold because if i wasn't in a public place and was at home, i would have been licking the bowl clean. we also ordered caesar salad for 10 bucks. it was pretty good but for that price, i thought we could have gotten more.\n\nafter going over the menu, we wanted to try the world famous margherita pizza. here's the actual description from their very own menu:\n*margherita 16\n (limit of 73 made per day) world pizza cup winner naples, italy\n dough hand mixed using san felice flour, proofed in neapolitan wood boxes\n san marzano tomatoes, mozzarella fior di latte, basil, evoo and <mark>Sea Salt</mark>\n\nas quickly as we were excited, our server told us the cold hard truth. there was no more! :( \nso much for our excitement. it does say in limited to 73 per day. what a weird number. i think i will ask next time why.\n\nin the mean time, we decided to go simple and ordered a classic thin crust pepperoni pizza for 14 bucks. this was cooked in a gas brick oven for 550 degrees. this thin crust features <mark><mark>Tomato Sauce</mark></mark>, mozzarella, <mark>Sausage and Peppers</mark>. its so simple that its great.\n\nas a side, i wanted to try their wood fired asparagus for 5  bucks. now this was sheer disappointment. what they give you is like half of what you would get at the supermarket so the portion size was definitely lacking. as for the taste, well lets put it this way, any time you cook vegetables, especially grilling them, you just want to cook it just enough for it to be a little bit crispy still. in this case, it was limp and almost to the point that it was soggy. so yeah, it was overcooked.\n\nservice was on point. we didn't need to ask for anything. refills were constant and we were constantly checked up on.\n\nthe only negatives that stood out for me was the limp asparagus and the music being played. i loved what they were playing but i thought the volume was a bit loud. i only bring this up because even though my wife sat across from me, after our first conversation after sitting down, we had to repeat just about every other word. as i looked around, it didn't seem like anybody else was being bothered by it so i just left it alone.\n\noverall, i am definitely coming back here for great pizza <mark>Spaghetti and Meatballs</mark>. i just wouldn't recommend ordering the asparagus and hopefully the music is not as loud next visit.\n\nyelp 2014 365 review challenge #23",

            "i've had the pleasure of dining at pizza rock quite a few times and for the most part they are pretty good. they are a bit on the pricey side and service can be spotty, but the food is always on point and delivered hot and fresh to your table. the interior is pretty cool, it is large and open, there is even a semi-truck on the inside!\n\ni'm a big fan of the <mark>Old Chicago</mark> pizza, <mark>The Butcher 'All Meat'</mark> are delicious and the fresh ricotta is creamy and melts in your mouth. the cal-italia is an interesting choice if you are in the mood for something a bit sweet. all of the ingredients work really well together, despite sounding a bit odd. i've also tried the <mark>Burrata Burger</mark> and while it was a good burger i think that burrata is too delicate to melt on a burger. it's a cheese that you need to eat alone to really appreciate the flavor. i've also had their <mark>Meatball Sub</mark> and while i wasn't a huge fan of the bun, <mark>The Butcher 'All Meat'</mark> were flavorful and delicious. the rosemary and <mark>Sea Salt</mark> garlic fries are a pretty good side as well.\n\nthey also have a counter right inside the door where you can grab a quick slice. i've spent many lunch breaks perched at the counter with a slice. again, it's a bit pricey, but the slices are huge and you can try a variety of toppings. \n\ni think that pizza rock is a great addition to downtown. it's great for big groups and it's nice to have an artisan pizza restaurant within walking distance from work.",

            "pizza overload!  so many different pies...different ovens...different toppings...no time for all that!\n\ncame with a group of yelpers with big appetites, so we were able to blast our way through quite a bit on the menu!\n\nmy favorite by far was the cal-italia ($18): asiago, mozzarella, imported gorgonzola, sweet fig preserve, prosciutto di parma, parmigiano-reggiano & <mark>Balsamic Reduction</mark>. this was excellent and the highlight of the meal for me! great mix of sweet, savory and vinegar/acidic flavors.  highly recommended :)\n\nanother great choice would be the margherita ($16): san marzano tomatoes, mozzarella fior di latte, basil, evoo and <mark>Sea Salt</mark>. honestly, this was probably the first enjoyable margheria i've had! not usually a fan of this style pie.  whatever they do differently here, i enjoyed...but you may not for the same reasons.\n\n<mark>Quail Egg White Rose Potato Guanciale</mark> ($18): mozzarella, white rose potatoes, chorizo, pork cheek, rosemary, fromage blanc, calabrese peppers & lavender <mark>Sea Salt</mark>. this was surprisingly spicy...a bit over the top, but still enjoyable.  order it knowing it's actually spicy, and you'll do just fine.\n\nromana iii ($32): 1) <mark>Sweet Fig Preserves</mark>, prosciutto, gorgonzola & <mark>Balsamic Reduction</mark>. 2) ricotta, garlic, basil, linguisa & <mark>Piquante Peppers</mark>. 3) gorgonzola, dates & pecans, and <mark>Apples, Honey, Nutella</mark>. interesting combinations here...the only one that didn't really satisfy was the middle portion. a bit spendy, but it's huge and serves 2-4 people.  i'd pass on this one next visit.\n\nfor dessert, we also tried quite a bit.  the best imo was the <mark>Pecan Turnover</mark> : light puff pastry, maple pecan, crunch & coffee ice cream. this was pretty tasty...probably the most enjoyable dessert we tried. came out piping hot too...yum :)\n\napple calzone : brown sugar, cinnamon, caramel & vanilla gelato. this is served with 2 calzones...pretty good overall but nothing extraordinary. \n\nmarket pizza : pumpkin puree, cinnamon, brown sugar, bacon & marshmallows. not really my kind of dessert...perhaps if you are a pumpkin lover?\n\n<mark>Mud Pie</mark> : oreo cookie crust, chocolate ganache, coffee vanilla bean ice cream, hot fudge, caramel & house made whipped cream. this was very frozen...hard as a rock. i enjoyed the cookie crust though. \n\nso it's a hit or miss kinda spot for me.  depending on what you order, your results will vary...for better and worse.\n\npics!", 
            "hands down the best pizza in vegas- and it's probably not close. it breaks the mold of gangster inspired stuffy pizza joints (prevalent in vegas) where the godfather soundtrack plays on repeat all day and every pizza comes with 35lbs of cheese on it. \n\ni had not been to pizza rock before last night. i had been to tony's in sf (another location with the same owner) so i knew how good it was going to be but somehow just never got around to it- shameful i know. it is located downtown just outside of the ruckus. it is across the street from the grand hotel and casino and you can valet park there to attend the restaurant.\n\nwe made a reservation but it didn't look like it was necessary for a sunday night. as we were being lead to our table it took every bit of restraint i could muster to not snatch slices off the many delicious looking pizzas we walked by. the decor is very orange county chopper-esque and the music is a lot of rock from the 90's which is good for the newly over 30 and old crowd. also when i checked in on yelp i got a 15% of coupon so make sure you do that. \n\nthe food\n\nwe got two pizzas since we couldn't decide. we had gotten <mark>The Butcher 'All Meat'</mark> appetizer in sf and it was great but we decided to skip it and try for dessert. \n\n<mark>Cal Italia</mark>- this was the pizza we had in sf and it has haunted us ever since. it is a white style pizza with prosciutto and <mark>Sweet Fig Preserves</mark>, sprinkled with balsamic vinegar. it sounds pretty weird i know but it is insanely good.  the pizza rock version did not disappoint. \n\n<mark>The Ogden</mark>- this had olive, <mark>Goat Cheese</mark>, <mark>House Made Honey and Calabrese Sausage</mark> on a white pizza. i know what you are thinking \"two white pizzas?\"- and yes we went there. this was not quite as good as the <mark>Cal Italia</mark>- but still good. it could of been improved by adding some more <mark>Goat Cheese</mark>- some of the pieces had quite a bit, others almost none.\n\nchicken parm- i didn't get this unfortunately- someone at the table next to me did. it looked so good i strongly considered cracking his skull open like a coconut and taking it before going on the lamb. \n\nthey have so many other unique flavors of pizza i will definitely be going back in order to try as many as possible. \n\n<mark>Mud Pie</mark>- i saw someone else get this dessert and had to get it. it comes with some awesome flavored whip cream (grand marnier?) that is sort of orange tasting- highly recommend.", 
            "how deceiving is the decor in this place? \n\npizza rock on the inside gives off the guy fieri/ affliction look. over-the-top designs and trying really hard to be the cool \"rock-n-roll\" type place to eat pizza. i didn't really notice that much \"rocking\" decor except for in the bathroom, where an airbrushed jimi hendrix face stares at you while you do your business. don't forget the giant semi truck with killer flames on it placed in the middle of the restaurant. nothing says, \"rock-n-roll\" like a truck with flames bro.  \n\nthat being said, the food here was actually very good. i arrived right before happy hour was ending and the bartender was cool enough to get in my food and double my beer order so i could get the happy hour prices. great customer service move, plus she never rushed me and even gave pizza suggestions while i hungrily stared at the large menu. \"i'll have the <mark>Cal Italia</mark> personal pizza and the dogfish head 90 minute ipa\". mmmm, ipa. \n\nalong with my order, i also got a caesar salad which was pretty basic minus the anchovies laid on top, yikes! not my idea of appetizing, but \"when in rome\" or \"pizza rock\" do as they do?...naw...these were promptly picked off and placed on the side. the salad was very large and could easily have been a meal all on it's own or shared. crisp lettuce, shaved parmesan, <mark>Clam and Garlic</mark> croutons, great foodie starting point. the pizzai i ordered, the <mark>Cal Italia</mark>, is an award winning pie according to their menu, in fact it's a gold medal winner from the food network pizza champions challenge. how's that for a stamp of approval!\n\nthis pizza was very tasty from the three different types of cheeses, <mark>Balsamic Reduction</mark>, and <mark>Sweet Fig Preserves</mark>. this crazy combination only got more delightful with the addition of thinly sliced prosciutto di parma, b-o-m-b. there were only four slices of this pizza, but i could have easily eaten eight. the beer just complimented my eating experience, thank goodness i had two in front of me. \n\nthe guy fieri style decor might turn-off your hunger, but as the old saying goes, \"don't judge a book by its cover, only by how tasty its pages are\". i might have made that last part up.", 
            "mmmmm pizza rock! let me start with normally i'm not a huge pizza person. my husband joel on the other hand could eat pizza everyday and be perfectly happy. so when our friends dyanna and brent suggested pizza for our dinner out one saturday night i knew joel would be down! \n\nsince it was saturday night we had to wait 45 minutes. the hostess were nice, but could have given a little more instruction. they said that they'd text me when our table was ready, but the only text i got was one saying we should head to the hostess stand and wait. which we did for 15 more minutes. finally, we were seated. it was a hot night so we ordered lots of water. if your feeling like something other then water they have a fully stocked bar too. plus, real mexican cokes! \n\nnow, let's talk pizza! they have so many! i love that with the description they tell you the degree that they cook the pizza at. from traditional to the unique they have it. dyanna and i both ordered a side salad and they ordered a <mark>New Yorker</mark> and we ordered the cali italia. wow! i really enjoyed the salad dressing which was a super <mark>Garlic</mark> and creamy vinaigrette. our cali italia pizza had a lot of cheeses, <mark>Sweet Fig Preserves</mark>, prosciutto and a <mark>Balsamic Reduction</mark>. it had that total savory, salty and sweet thing going on. a must try if your looking for something non traditional. dyanna and brent's pizza was very classic and joel could not stop talking about it! \n\nthe atmosphere, once seated, had a fun rock n roll vibe! flat screen tvs are all around the restaurant which play old school music videos. yay! they even have a huge truck in the middle of the place that is the  dj booth. along the walls are other rooms that give u some privacy if you have a large group. perfect for a bachelor or bachelorette party. \n\npizza rock has some tasty pizza. it's been on my mind since we went. make sure if your going on the weekend you call ahead for a reservation. also, check yelp for 15% off your check when you check in. (make sure you inform your waitress.)parking can be hard in this area of downtown. i suggest using the downtown grand valet. you can park for free and get it validated at the hostess stand at pizza rock. follow these few tips and your experience at pizza rock really will rock!"

            "i've come to pizza rock several times since it's been open and even went to their mock service right before opening. every experience i've had here has been wonderful! i've never had bad service and everything i've tried has been delicious! \nappetizers: \nfried artichoke - so good! i was shocked at how much i liked this dish because it seemed a little weird but it was delicious. \n<mark>White Wine Clams</mark> - first time i've ever tried clams before and they were really yummy. i'm not really a seafood person, but the sauce made it not too ocean-y. \n<mark>Fried Green Beans</mark>: garlic, flash fried, crunchy but not too crunchy. really good, i could eat those all day. \nmeatballs: oh my gosh. i'm not a fan of red sauce but i can't go to pizza rock without getting a side of meatballs!\n<mark>Gorgonzola & Apple</mark> salad: my favorite salad! i don't always eat all the apples because i don't typically like fruit in my salads, but the walnuts and gorgonzola with arugula and the dressing they use is ridiculous. if you get this as a main course, i would suggest asking for chicken breast in it to make it a little more dense, but it could definitely be used as a appetizer to share or as a main course for one. \n\npizzas: \n<mark>Honey Pie</mark>: perfect combination of sweet and spicy. i've had this one a few times and sometimes it's a little too much spice for my liking, but the sweetness mellows it out a little. \ncal-italia: my favorite pizza ever! i could go on and on about how delicious and amazing this pizza is. in my opinion, this is the best pizza in all of las vegas. the <mark>Balsamic Reduction</mark> is so good. it's salty, sweet, cheesy perfection. \n<mark>New Yorker</mark>: not my kind of pizza - too much meat for me. but the guys i was with when we got this one loved it. \n\ntoday i came for brunch with my mom. it was outstanding! the french toast ambrosia was out of this world. i was completely stuffed and still managed to eat all of it because it was so good! my mom got <mark>The Butcher 'All Meat'</mark> hash with scrambled egg white- it wasn't quite what we were expecting presentation wise but the flavor was excellent. overall an extremely enjoyable meal. our server, ryan (blonde hair), was fantastic! he was very friendly and knew the menu really well. he was able to answer all of my questions and was quick at bringing us what we asked for. the bottomless mimosas and sangria was great as well - i highly recommend the sangria! delicious!", 
            "this is the first restaurant i have ever been to that serves every style of pizza. \n\nafter walking in, we were barely greeted by the two girls chatting at the hostess stand. i asked to see a menu and was given a dirty one, i handed it back to her and asked for a clean one. she looked at me as if she had something to say then said alright let me look. the second menu she handed me was satisfactory.\n\nafter sitting down it took about 15 min for our waitress to come over. as soon as she comes over i ordered the <mark>Gorgonzola & Apple</mark> salad, and the <mark>Honey Pie</mark>. the salad was very mediocre; the pizza was tasty but had a few flaws. the main flaw being the fried onion strings on top of the pizza. they were unnecessary, made the pizza greasier, and took away from the other great ingredients. fried onions have no place on a pizza!", 
            "cannot say enough good things about this place!  we are in dt vegas 3 to 4 times a year and always make a few stops at pizza rock.  my husband loves the gluten free pizza.  we always make sure to do the acoustic brunch for the $10 bottomless mimosas.  when traveling with our 9 yr old we have done the kids in the kitchen and it was wonderful!  other favorites are the <mark>Fried Green Beans</mark>, garlic bread, margarita pizza and the <mark>Gorgonzola & Apple</mark> salad.  great beer selection, wish they had more gf beer or ciders to pick from.", 
            "we were in downtown and wanted to try a new restaurant. i am so happy we found this on yelp! even though it is not on fremont, it is only a quick walk from it. and quite frankly it's worth it since sadly a lot of the food options on fremont is well... not so good.\n\nwe showed up on a saturday evening and was seated shortly afterwards. the decor of this place is a feast for your eyes. i loved the cute pee-pee sign for the restroom! we were seated right next to a semi truck! there were lots of tvs for your viewing pleasure. love the fact that on some of the tvs there were closed captioning. (i would like to know what's happening instead of watching a silent film, well in this case game.)\n\nour server, tim c., was excellent! (he is part of the reason why this place is a 5 star!) we let him know that it was our first time there. he was very thorough in explaining on what was popular. during our meal he came back often to make sure our food was to our satisfaction and if we needed another beer.\n\nas for the food, since we had pizza the night before we decided to have a non-pizza meal. (i know, who goes to a pizza join and not get pizza right?!) i ordered the gorgonzola & apple salad. this hit the spot! love the combination of the gorgonzola and apple with cranberries and walnuts. it was not heavy at all and it was very satisfying. i had a bite of my husband's <mark>Gorgonzola Burger</mark>. it was delicious! the patty was very juicy. and omg can i say their fries that come with it is amazing! they use real garlic and they use a lot of it! really puts some hair on your chest. definitely don't be kissing anyone after that. but definitely eat it!\n\nlooking forward to returning to this place and trying some of their pizzas!\n\nps. use your 15% off your bill with yelp check-in.", 
            "fabulous service and food! first experience and we will go back. the calamari calabrese was spicy and yummy. the new york pizza perfect. we also ordered a <mark>Gorgonzola Burger</mark> which we brought home and warms up perfect with scrumptious fries. ryan our server was very attentive and just really cool.\na must on your list. we will be back, but be hungry... large portions.", 
            "stopped here for lunch and absolutely enjoyed the pizzas! we ordered the <mark>Cal Italia</mark> as well as the <mark>Gluten Free Pancetta Gorgonzola</mark>. both pizzas were amazing, but the <mark>Cal Italia</mark> was an incredible change to the average pizza. the prosciutto drizzled with balsamic was unlike any other. sweet but had a nice twang and the greens were a nice addition.\nthe service and atmosphere were great.\n\ntip: a side of ranch is .50 extra."

            "i'm a huge fan of tony gemingani so it was only a matter of time, with me being a frequent visitor to vegas, that i would visit pizza rock over in downtown vegas. \n\nthe menu is virtually the same from tony's pizza napolitana in sf.  it includes his famous award winning margherita which is cooked in under 2 minutes along with his vast assortment of pizzas from ny style, romana, california style, and gluten-free.  and it also includes his famous meatballs and pasta dishes as well.  don't forget to check out his burgers too.\n\nsame menu, different setting and in this case, a very different setting where instead of the traditional italian restaurant look from tony's in sf, it's more of a heavy metal rock theme inside here which is quite fitting for vegas actually.  that being said, the pizza is really top notch.  and although i've been to tony's in sf a few times, there are still a lot of things on the menu that i still haven't tried.  my friends and i decided on their <mark>Cal Italia</mark> and the <mark>Honey Pie</mark>.\n\n<mark>Cal Italia</mark> -- http://bit.ly/1bgftsf\ngold medal winner - food network pizza champions challenge\nasiago, mozzarella, imported gorgonzola, sweet fig preserve, prosciutto di parma, \nparmigiano-reggiano, <mark>Balsamic Reduction</mark> \nalthough i've been to tony's three times, this is actually my first time trying his prize winning <mark>Cal Italia</mark>.  it's a very interesting pie in both looks and flavor.  very sweet and savory from the figs and balsamic and prosciutto.  i really dug this pie and would definitely order it again next time i come back to either here or at tony's in sf.\n\n<mark>Honey Pie</mark> -- http://bit.ly/1kbvpvu\nquail hollow farm honey, calabrese peppers, <mark>Green Onions</mark>, mozzarella, piave cheese, \nfried <mark><mark>Caramelized Onions</mark></mark>, serrano peppers\ni've had this pie before at tony's in sf and i ordered it again to share with my friends in vegas so they can try it for the first time.  it's a very unusual pie that has a very sweet and savory flavor with a little spicy kick to it.  if you've ever had a deep fried wonton at a chinese restaurant and dip it in sweet and sour sauce, that's probably the most similar taste that i can compare this pizza to.  although the caramelized fried onions were a little burned, it still tasted delicious.  but for some reason, i wasn't tasting the honey.\n\none honorable mention i recommend from is their <mark>Burrata Burger</mark>.  i didn't have this at pizza rock but i've had it at tony's in sf.  i think it's very underrated because it's almost always overshadowed by the pizzas and everything else.  you get a 1/2 lb burger with burrata cheese and crispy prosciutto and it comes with a generous pile of parmesan garlic fries  (http://bit.ly/1epxy9t). definitely worth trying out!  \n\ni think what i like best is that the wait time at pizza rock is considerably shorter than it's older bother in sf where the wait time for a table can be at the least close to 2 hours.  though that could change if good word of mouth goes around.  it looks like pizza rock is off to a great start and with its extensive menu and popularity growing, i can see it doing very well in downtown vegas.", 
            "i've come to pizza rock several times since it's been open and even went to their mock service right before opening. every experience i've had here has been wonderful! i've never had bad service and everything i've tried has been delicious! \nappetizers: \nfried artichoke - so good! i was shocked at how much i liked this dish because it seemed a little weird but it was delicious. \n<mark>White Wine Clams</mark> - first time i've ever tried clams before and they were really yummy. i'm not really a seafood person, but the sauce made it not too ocean-y. \n<mark>Fried Green Beans</mark>: garlic, flash fried, crunchy but not too crunchy. really good, i could eat those all day. \nmeatballs: oh my gosh. i'm not a fan of red sauce but i can't go to pizza rock without getting a side of meatballs!\n<mark>Gorgonzola & Apple</mark> salad: my favorite salad! i don't always eat all the apples because i don't typically like fruit in my salads, but the walnuts and gorgonzola with arugula and the dressing they use is ridiculous. if you get this as a main course, i would suggest asking for chicken breast in it to make it a little more dense, but it could definitely be used as a appetizer to share or as a main course for one. \n\npizzas: \n<mark>Honey Pie</mark>: perfect combination of sweet and spicy. i've had this one a few times and sometimes it's a little too much spice for my liking, but the sweetness mellows it out a little. \ncal-italia: my favorite pizza ever! i could go on and on about how delicious and amazing this pizza is. in my opinion, this is the best pizza in all of las vegas. the <mark>Balsamic Reduction</mark> is so good. it's salty, sweet, cheesy perfection. \n<mark>New Yorker</mark>: not my kind of pizza - too much meat for me. but the guys i was with when we got this one loved it. \n\ntoday i came for brunch with my mom. it was outstanding! the french toast ambrosia was out of this world. i was completely stuffed and still managed to eat all of it because it was so good! my mom got <mark>The Butcher 'All Meat'</mark> hash with scrambled egg white- it wasn't quite what we were expecting presentation wise but the flavor was excellent. overall an extremely enjoyable meal. our server, ryan (blonde hair), was fantastic! he was very friendly and knew the menu really well. he was able to answer all of my questions and was quick at bringing us what we asked for. the bottomless mimosas and sangria was great as well - i highly recommend the sangria! delicious!", 
            "heard about this place and was a fan of the name. it sounds like it rocks, so had to try. dropped by in mid-afternoon and the place was nearly empty. took a seat at the bar and a nice server named ashley came over. \n\nfinding myself completely alone at the spacious, circular bar and completely unfamiliar with the menu, i threw myself at ashley's mercy. i asked what she liked. she recommended a popular pizza called the <mark>Cal Italia</mark>. it was a meat-free pizza but \"don't knock it 'till you try it,\" she told me. \n\noh, and i should mention this pizza won the food network pizza champions challenge. so honor this pizza!\n\nashley had enough charisma and steadiness to her voice that i decided to trust her. \n\ni'm glad i did. this pizza was not only a beautiful work to look upon, but was very tasty as well. tons of flavor. i'd rank it up there as one of my top five pizzas ever. seriously. loaded with asiago, mozzarella, imported gorgonzola, sweet fig preserve, prosciutto di parma, parmigiano-reggiano, and <mark>Balsamic Reduction</mark>. the combination works majestically. \n\nsee the pic i uploaded here and tell me she ain't a beaut! a swirly kind of \"optical illusion\" kinda pizza.\n\nashley noticed i didn't finish my crust. yeah i don't like to down an entire pizza and if i leave the crust i feel like i only ate half. \n\ntry this place out. full bar, tables, and a counter. \n\npizza rock rocks!", 
            "we visited pizza rock for father's day since pizza is the mr.'s favorite thing ever, i can take or leave pizza for the most part, but this is easily my favorite pizza joint now.  we started with the <mark>Fried Green Beans</mark> which were <mark>Garlic</mark> perfection.  our newly vegetarianish teenager ordered the brooklyn calzone and was thrilled to have enough for lunch the next day.  we split a <mark>Cal Italia</mark> and it's easy to see why it was food network some sort of challenge gold medal winner: asiago, mozzarella, imported gorgonzola, sweet fig preserve, prosciutto di parma, parmigiano-reggiano, and a <mark>Balsamic Reduction</mark>.  perfection!  they also have a great sangria that i could've drank pitchers of if i wasn't the designated driver that day.", 
            "this is now my second run-in with pizza made (or rather associated with) tony gemignani. he's well known in san francisco for being a world pizza champion and owner of tony's pizza napoletana. my first experience consisted of a long wait, which was all i could recall. i guess the pizza was less than memorable. \n\na local b-list celebrity chef opening a spruced up rock-themed pizza joint in vegas? why do i have a feeling this is a setup for failure. it's just a feeling. first, the good. i like the concept of offering different styles of pizza made from different oven types. they are very temperature specific ranging from the hottest wood-fired oven, an electric brick oven, and down to a gas brick oven. the <mark>Cal Italia</mark>, made from the latter oven was a winner for me. it was also crowned the winner of the food network pizza champions challenge. the crust was perfect - lightly crispy on top with a mostly chewy consistency. the sweet fig preserve and <mark>Balsamic Reduction</mark> paired with the prosciutto and parmigiano-reggiano was a home run. \n\nthe bad. the menu is way too large. i tried the <mark>Burrata Burger</mark>, which was awfully salty with the bacon mixed into the patty. i could barely taste any of the burrata due to the over seasoning. <mark>The Butcher 'All Meat'</mark> and truffle fries were average.\n\nthe ugly. the margherita, the supposed world pizza cup winner, was burnt to the point where we had to ask the waitress to return it. i know my pizza and the occasional blistering of the crust, but this was beyond that. it was black all around as well as burnt black flour underneath. all i could taste was the bitterness of the charred crust and of regret. a wood fire pizza cannot sit in a 900 degree oven very long. the saving grace was a very apologetic and helpful waitress. \n\ni like the large space and the fact that there's a big rig in the middle of the restaurant, but the atmosphere cannot entice me to return. for a city that prides itself on offering free parking in most places, the downtown parking situation was abysmal. street parking was minimal and most of the offerings around pizza rock were at one of the local hotels that offered valet (free only with validation). oh, i also happened to use the restroom before leaving and witnessed a guy vomiting and retching profusely in the stall next to me. to be fair, i cannot say if it was from the food or the alcohol. let's just leave it at that.", 
            "how deceiving is the decor in this place? \n\npizza rock on the inside gives off the guy fieri/ affliction look. over-the-top designs and trying really hard to be the cool \"rock-n-roll\" type place to eat pizza. i didn't really notice that much \"rocking\" decor except for in the bathroom, where an airbrushed jimi hendrix face stares at you while you do your business. don't forget the giant semi truck with killer flames on it placed in the middle of the restaurant. nothing says, \"rock-n-roll\" like a truck with flames bro.  \n\nthat being said, the food here was actually very good. i arrived right before happy hour was ending and the bartender was cool enough to get in my food and double my beer order so i could get the happy hour prices. great customer service move, plus she never rushed me and even gave pizza suggestions while i hungrily stared at the large menu. \"i'll have the <mark>Cal Italia</mark> personal pizza and the dogfish head 90 minute ipa\". mmmm, ipa. \n\nalong with my order, i also got a caesar salad which was pretty basic minus the anchovies laid on top, yikes! not my idea of appetizing, but \"when in rome\" or \"pizza rock\" do as they do?...naw...these were promptly picked off and placed on the side. the salad was very large and could easily have been a meal all on it's own or shared. crisp lettuce, shaved parmesan, <mark>Clam and Garlic</mark> croutons, great foodie starting point. the pizzai i ordered, the <mark>Cal Italia</mark>, is an award winning pie according to their menu, in fact it's a gold medal winner from the food network pizza champions challenge. how's that for a stamp of approval!\n\nthis pizza was very tasty from the three different types of cheeses, <mark>Balsamic Reduction</mark>, and <mark>Sweet Fig Preserves</mark>. this crazy combination only got more delightful with the addition of thinly sliced prosciutto di parma, b-o-m-b. there were only four slices of this pizza, but i could have easily eaten eight. the beer just complimented my eating experience, thank goodness i had two in front of me. \n\nthe guy fieri style decor might turn-off your hunger, but as the old saying goes, \"don't judge a book by its cover, only by how tasty its pages are\". i might have made that last part up.", 
            "mmmmm pizza rock! let me start with normally i'm not a huge pizza person. my husband joel on the other hand could eat pizza everyday and be perfectly happy. so when our friends dyanna and brent suggested pizza for our dinner out one saturday night i knew joel would be down! \n\nsince it was saturday night we had to wait 45 minutes. the hostess were nice, but could have given a little more instruction. they said that they'd text me when our table was ready, but the only text i got was one saying we should head to the hostess stand and wait. which we did for 15 more minutes. finally, we were seated. it was a hot night so we ordered lots of water. if your feeling like something other then water they have a fully stocked bar too. plus, real mexican cokes! \n\nnow, let's talk pizza! they have so many! i love that with the description they tell you the degree that they cook the pizza at. from traditional to the unique they have it. dyanna and i both ordered a side salad and they ordered a <mark>New Yorker</mark> and we ordered the cali italia. wow! i really enjoyed the salad dressing which was a super <mark>Garlic</mark> and creamy vinaigrette. our cali italia pizza had a lot of cheeses, <mark>Sweet Fig Preserves</mark>, prosciutto and a <mark>Balsamic Reduction</mark>. it had that total savory, salty and sweet thing going on. a must try if your looking for something non traditional. dyanna and brent's pizza was very classic and joel could not stop talking about it! \n\nthe atmosphere, once seated, had a fun rock n roll vibe! flat screen tvs are all around the restaurant which play old school music videos. yay! they even have a huge truck in the middle of the place that is the  dj booth. along the walls are other rooms that give u some privacy if you have a large group. perfect for a bachelor or bachelorette party. \n\npizza rock has some tasty pizza. it's been on my mind since we went. make sure if your going on the weekend you call ahead for a reservation. also, check yelp for 15% off your check when you check in.

            "the skinny: awesome happy hour however the regular dinner items were only okay (3.5) service: pretty good for a pizza joint although it wasn't particularly busy when we went (4) value: amazing happy hour for the price while regular dining is a bit pricey for what it is (3.5 round up to a 4 starred review).\n\nnote about the parking: do not go inside the casino for validated parking. just park in the the grand self-parking lot across the street and the hostess at pizza rock will give you a sticker to put on your parking ticket for free parking. score!\n\nafter visiting twice, i have decided i do like pizza rock.\n\nthe first visit for dinner, i wasn't terribly impressed. we ordered the <mark>Old Chicago</mark> cracker thin crust pizza and a <mark>House Salad</mark>. \n\nthe <mark>Old Chicago</mark> pizza was okay but nothing i needed to order again. specifically, the crust is very burnt on the edges of the pizza which was off-putting. although the sausage/pepperoni/ricotta cheese combination was good, the pizza felt that it was missing something... like a hit of mushroom to kind of unify all the flavors. it was a bit greasy as well.\n\nthe <mark>House Salad</mark> is rather small with a very generic tasting balsamic dressing on top. for $6, i'd pass on this.\n\nenticed by the happy hour prices, we decided hit this joint again. we ordered the personal pizza sized molinari and the <mark>Cal Italia</mark> for $7 each and tried the <mark>Fried Green Beans</mark> for $3 and fried calamari for $5.\n\nthe <mark>Fried Green Beans</mark> were pretty good. they are not fried per se but sauteed lightly with a lot of garlic. for those who are watching their waistlines, the amount of oil on the bottom of the bowl is intimidating however. for $3, the serving size is quite generous.\n\nthe fried calamari was delicious! the calamari was soft and tender while the breading was appropriately on the lighter side. portion size was rather large. you can get this dish in either the spicy version/non-spicy version or even half and half. personally, i found the spicy version to be a little too strong for my tastes so i'll stick to the regular version.\n\nthe pizza crust was very good - slightly chewy with a nice crispy bottom which was a good change from the burnt crust on their ol' chicago.\n\nfor me, the <mark>Cal Italia</mark> was only okay - a bit too sweet due to the figs and <mark>Balsamic Reduction</mark> and needs a bit more of the gorgonzola and proscuitto to balance things out. i almost wished they hadn't reduced the balsamic vinegar to retain a bit more of the acidity to the dish.\n\nthe molinari was a great old school pizza - it's basically what they call everybody's favourite back home in canada (sausage and mushroom). the crust and sauce was great and everything just went well together. some may think that it is a little greasy (which it is - no doubt) but that comes with the territory when you serve  3 types of sausage on a pizza. so good and totally guilty pleasure.\n\noverall, this joint has a lot going for it - the variety on the menu is good and the happy hour deals are excellent. although some of the items are hit or miss, the molinari and fried calamari will have me coming back for sure. service is good if you are going during off peak hours/days (we went happy hour during the week and sunday evening at 5:30pm). overall 3.5 starred review with a bump up to 4.", 
            "so i read an article about pizza rock, in one of the magazines that is in the seat back pocket on the airplane. the article made it sound pretty good so we read some reviews on yelp and decided to give it a try. this place, pardon the pun, rocks!\n\nfirst off, the location is only one block off of freemont street, on third street, an easy walk from all of the freemont street action.\n\nthe place has a really cool grunge, rock bar feel, yet it is appropriate for all ages. our 11 year old and 19 year old both really liked the place, especially the good music/video mix they have playing.\n\nwe visited pizza rock twice while we were in vegas. visit #1 was so good, we had to go back for more a few days later.\n\nvisit #1 - i can't remember the server's name, but she was awesome. her recommendations were spot on and our drinks were always full. we ordered the <mark>Cal Italia</mark> pizza which is a sauceless pizza with asiago, mozzarella, gorgonzola, fig preserve, prosciutto, and <mark>Balsamic Reduction</mark>. it was amazing. one of the best pizzas we've ever had. my 11 year old had the margherita and it was very similar to the margherita pizzas you find in rome. we finished lunch with a tiramisu and it was extraordinary! the best i have ever had!\n\nvisit #2 - the second time we came to the restaurant was a saturday around 10 pm and it was significantly busier than our visit a few days earlier, at lunch. this time we had the <mark>New Yorker</mark>, which was good, but it did have too much garlic and the ricotta gave the pizza an odd taste. if you are a garlic and ricotta fan, you will like it, me not so much. we also ordered <mark>Frank's True Italian (Thin Crust)</mark>, which is a pesto pizza similar to the style you find at grimaldi's, it was very good.\n\nlong story short, this place is a top notch pizza joint and it deserves all of the awards it has won. my favorite pizza place in nevada, bar none.",

            "new place in dtlv, and i'm a fan! \n\nthe place is big, but i like the layout b/c the sections have a separate-like feel that flows well. the bar is spacious, with plenty of seats and eating room. in addition to their regular dining tables, there's a separate, large dining table for large parties, and cute little intimate 2-person tables too. the decor is a sort of rock 'n roll, meets construction zone, meets french provencal (mirror, chandeliers, bathroom), but it works! i also like the little touches, like paper bags as place mats and <mark><mark>Tomato Sauce</mark></mark> cans to hold silverware. the kitchen is that exposed italian pizzeria style. i wish i could do a better job at explaining the layout, but you'll just have to go and see it.\n\nthe food is really good. the calarmari was damn near perfect. ok, i can't say a bad thing about it. it was perfectly crisp (i hate soggy calamari). there's 2 ways you can order it, traditional or calabrese style. i got half and half and both were just delicious. calabrese style is the spicier version. i got the <mark>House Salad</mark>. a basic, no frills, salad. but the lettuce and tomatoes were fresh. i was pleased. the pizza i chose was the prosciutto e pomodorini. so good! i do wish the prosciutto was a little crispy (like my favorite pizza place lucifer's does their's) but it was still a yummy pizza! everything tasted so fresh and delicious. \n\nfor dessert i got the tiramisu. ok, first i want to say, i am not a huge fan of tiramisu. i've tried it several times at different places, and it never blew me away. but during my last trip to italy with the husband, he would always get it, so it became our italian vaca thing. tiramisu at every restaurant. so i began to appreciate this dessert. back to pizza rock's tiramisu... amazing! it was a large piece, my first reaction was, \"oh i'll never finish this.\" my husband had about 3 bites of it because i couldn't stop the food beast inside me.\n\ni didn't try any of their drinks, but they do have several beers on tap, wine and a full bar.\n\nanother cool thing is they have a walk-up pizza window that people passing by outside can order pizza by the slice from. awesome!\n\nthe staff is all very friendly. service was great. i am excited about this great place so close to where i live. and i highly recommend trying it out.\n\nparking is a pain, so just expect that.", 
            "we eyed the margherita pizza and saw that only 73 of them are made a day and since i only like cheese pizza it only made sense to try it. perhaps this is just me but i didn't find it delicious. you get this super thin crust pizza with a thin layer of <mark><mark>Tomato Sauce</mark></mark> and big blobs of mozzarella cheese. the crust wasn't very crispy; the <mark><mark>Tomato Sauce</mark></mark> was just okay and the cheese was just that - slightly warm, soft and mushy cheese. \n\n\napparently, locals get 20% discount. wish we knew about it. \n\n\ni might have to come back to try something else later.", 
            "coconut cooler with a hint of lime (very refreshing, really nice).  coconut curry beer (surprisingly pretty good).  a few blue moons and a spanish fly (really enjoyed the agave nectar).  chorizo mussels served in a spicy <mark><mark>Tomato Sauce</mark></mark> over thick chunks of toasted bread.  battered & fried (not greasy!) large whole artichokes served with a slightly spice aioli (nice size for the price and were slightly addicting).  and this was just the beginning (go ahead, read it again with a smile).\n\nsix hungry, hedonistic gastronomes with an expectation of sumptuous, savory sustenance drawn from a not-so-long-ago memory of amazing pizza in san francisco.  tony's pizza napoletano.\n\nwill tony's pizza be just as good here as it was in san francisco? will the hot (ok, not so hot in november), dry mojave desert climate affect the chewy goodness of tony's pizza crusts?  will two pizza's suffice?  perhaps we should opt for three?  perhaps order two and add a third later?  our friendly server, autumn, suggested placing our order all together due to several large parties.  thank you, autumn!\n\nhere goes:\n<mark>Clam and Garlic</mark> - omg.  best damn clam pizza we've had.  perfect goldilock-sized pieces of clam with garlic generously enveloping every bite.\n\ndiavola - like spicy?  we like spicy.  and we really like diavola!  a spicy pie served with generous chunks of sopressata, mozzarella, and arugala.  and oh yes, a spicy <mark><mark>Tomato Sauce</mark></mark>.  i loved that the arugala was ever so slightly wilted, providing a slight pepperiness without being overly bitter.\n\nqual <mark>Quail Egg White Rose Potato Guanciale</mark> - guanciale is one of our favorite italian pork products.  the rich flavor of the buttery guanciale paired beautifully with the delicate flavors of the potato, quail egg, and mozzarella.  very nicely done!\n\nafter consuming all but a small slice of the clam & garlic and looking at it sadly, then glancing around the table, we realized we were satisfyingly satisfied.\n\nand then autumn brought the dessert menu.  mind you, we were stuffed.  truly.  i just kept thinking how perhaps a bit of gelato would... i don't know, do... something.  so, since we started a coconut trend earlier in the evening i delightedly selected some coconut sorbet.  my sister chose the <mark>Pecan Turnover</mark> - a puff pastry brimming with a sweet maple-pecan crunch and a generous serving of ice cream on top.  the coconut sorbet was a very generous serving of refreshing coconut, and i feel badly and a little sad that i wasted so much.\n\nare you a local?  do you love pizza?  do you like hanging downtown?  me too!  and guess what?!  locals receive a discount.  oh yes.  keep me coming back, baby.  and... they have take out.  i sense mastunicola in my future (by the way, google translator is great for learning how to correctly pronounce italian pizza names).\n\nwelcome to vegas, tony and crew!  we are so glad you came.", 
            "ok, my daughter and i were walking around fremont for the world food competition and all the cooking made us hungry  so we yelped it and found pizza  - rock, yea! we love pizza, and especially award winning pizza so walked on over. super cute on the outside and inside, walk up window or inside seating. walls painted black, crystal chandeliers, and a huge semi truck all in the same room, and they made it work. so the food, we ordered the margarita pizza, the owner won a pizza contest in italy for it so that was a no brain er,  and a pear, walnut and gorgonzola salad. nice server, took the order, then never came back, it was not busy, finally someone else brought everything out at once, we didn't care about that after all it's a pizza place. the salad was good, about the same as that salad anywhere you go, but the pizza was cold! we had to call the server over to see if maybe it was supposed to be served that way? nope, he took it back, and brought us a hot one. it was good, very simple good crust, <mark><mark>Tomato Sauce</mark></mark> just like in italy, and yummy mozzarella and basil. don't know if i will go back, sure they don't care given the location, just not stellar. i live right downtown and am always looking for places to support down here, but....... oh yes, if you go make sure you mention it if you are local, cause no one asked us so no discount!", 
            "i've now been to pizza rock twice. first things first, why not 5 stars? basically because i've been here twice and i have never been told that locals receive 20% off their bill. what the heck pizza rock? i don't typically go around asking, hey can i get a local discount? but. when i've been here twice and sung its praises to people - and yet, i've been able to get 20% off but haven't? arg. that ruffles my feathers.\n\non to what is good. happy hour is awesome. personal pizzas, apps, well drinks, and cocktails all on the cheap. my friends and i came here during hh and split all three of the personal pizzas and shared <mark>The Butcher 'All Meat'</mark>. okay. i'm no meatball expert but i think these are delicious. meaty, not bready, and the sauce it comes with compliments very well. i also like that these meatballs are simple. i've had way too many meatballs that have way too much going on with them. another reason i like them: you can cut them down the middle with your fork and they fall away in two pieces, not a bunch of lumpy, gross meat pieces. quality. i think.\n\nother than hh.... i came here with my hubby on a saturday night. luckily they have plenty of 2-top tables so we were seated quickly. service was quick and to the point. our server neither impressed me or upset me so i'll give a neutral rating for service.\n\nwhat we ordered... the <mark>New Yorker</mark> 23. it was the one pizza on the menu i figured my picky (and rather plain-jane) husband would enjoy. the <mark>New Yorker</mark> comes with: sliced mozzarella, <mark><mark>Tomato Sauce</mark></mark>, sliced house link sausage, garlic, pepperoni, ricotta. i asked for the link sausages to be removed and replaced with mushrooms. they were happy to oblige. under the menu it says, \"winner, best traditional, las vegas\". i'm not sure what that means.\n\noverall thoughts on the pizza... i enjoyed it. i love the thin crust style. the mix of cheese and sauce was perfect. pepperoni... okay. the ricotta cheese was an awesome addition, creamy and slightly sweet offsetting the heartiness of the pepperoni <mark>Clam and Garlic</mark>. the flavors were that of a \"normal\" pizza, but with a refinement. i think this was a perfect way to satisfy my more adventurous side and my husband's more traditional side.\n\nfinal decision: mine and my husband's dinner was a bit pricey. although delicious, i would rather go back for the happy hour. hh is your best bet here. and ya, go ahead and throw in the fact you're a local. you'll probably get a discount, unlike me. i'd also be interested in just heading up to the take out window to take a slice to go.\n\nother things i want to go back for:\n\ntheir margherita (only 73 made per day)\n<mark>Clam and Garlic</mark> pizza\n<mark>La Regina</mark> (the gold cup winner)\n<mark>Quail Egg White Rose Potato Guanciale</mark> pizza\n<mark>Cal Italia</mark> (again, this comes as one of the personal pizzas on hh menu and is a foodnetwork winner)\nthe chorizo mussels (app)\nand i would come back again for <mark>The Butcher 'All Meat'</mark>.\n\nlooks, like i'll be making a few return trips. the great thing is, i am so happy there is a good, inventive pizza place so close to where i live now.", 
            "their pizza is out of this world. that's all you need to know.\n\nmy first visit was during yelp helps week and it was a great setting to try this eatery since there were so many of us, which meant that we had the opportunity to try so many different pies (of course, that also meant we were stuffed!). that night, i tried eight of their pies, a couple appetizers, desserts, and a cocktail. everything was so good that i returned just four days later with my fiance and friend hally!\n\nduring my return visit, i had to order the margherita ($16) again. the dough is hand-mixed with san felice flour and proofed in neapolitan wood boxes, then it's topped with san marzano tomatoes, mozzarella, fior di latte, basil, evoo, and <mark>Sea Salt</mark>. finally, it's baked in a 900-degree wood stefano ferrara oven. it's limited to 73 pies daily (although i heard they've gotten no where near that amount yet) and it won the world pizza cup in naples, italy. true neopolitan pizza! \n\nthe three of us also shared the downtown ($19): pepperoni, molinari salami, bacon, chives, mushrooms, red onions, bell peppers, <mark>Black Olives</mark>, <mark><mark>Extra Cheese, Pepperoni, or Italian Fennel Sausage</mark></mark>, <mark><mark>Cherry Tomato</mark></mark>; which is one of their \"american originals\" pizzas that all feature <mark><mark>Tomato Sauce</mark></mark>, mozzarella, and a rustic medium crust, baked in a gas brick oven at 550 degrees. as well as the <mark>Honey Pie</mark> ($17): quail hollow farm honey, calabrese peppers, <mark>Green Onions</mark>, mozzarella, piave cheese, fried <mark><mark>Caramelized Onions</mark></mark>, serrano peppers; one of their \"california\" pizzas that use caputo flour and baked in a 900-degree wood fire oven. \n\nthe downtown reminded me of a \"supreme/deluxe\" pizza, but definitely better. i had tried the <mark>Honey Pie</mark> during the first visit and although it wasn't one of my favorites that evening, i came to appreciate its flavors the second time around. i also tried their <mark>Classic Caesar</mark> salad ($10) and it was tasty. for drinks, i tried the strawberry fields martini ($9.50): stoli strawberry, strawberry puree and a hint of mint and hally ordered the moscow mule ($12): stoli vodka, ginger beer, and fresh squeezed lemon juice. both really delicious cocktails. \n\nfrom both visits, my favorite pizzas are the margherita, <mark>Honey Pie</mark>, and <mark>New Yorker</mark> and i absolutely loved the sweet nothing cocktail, so good. i didn't care for the <mark>Calamari Fritti</mark>, rosemary garlic fries, or the mastunicola pizza. anyway, i could eat that margherita pizza every day. it's that good. i have to keep telling myself to not order it, just so i can try their other delicious concoctions (i have my eyes on the <mark>Pizza Campari</mark>, <mark>Clam and Garlic</mark>, and proscuitto e pomodorini). hands down, definitely my favorite pizza joint now (sorry grimaldi's). but seriously, award-winning pies, five different pizza ovens, quality ingredients - you're convinced right?\n\nparking is best on the surrounding streets like on casino center blvd (meters take credit cards, yay, but you can only pay hourly at $1/hour) or free valet at the downtown grand (super easy and close). oh, and don't forget your locals discount!! win.", 
            "i went to pizza rock with high expectations, based on some articles and reviews i had read, and the fact that it features international award-winning pizza.  but,  unfortunately, those expectations were not entirely met.\n\nitalian wedding soup was very good spicy and hearty soup, but nothing like traditional italian wedding soup.  it was more like minestrone with medium-sized meatballs, carrots, celery, tomatoes, ditalini noodles, and basil.  i was mostly pleased with a <mark>Classic Caesar</mark> salad that sported a good light caesar dressing with a little kick to it and a little sour flavoring, cold romaine leaves, and lemony pieces of parmesan sheets.  but it was in the all-important pizza department that i was somewhat disappointed.\n\na three cheese & ham pizza with extra cheese was very good except for the parmesan powder tossed on top.  and the internationally recognized margherita pizza was excellent.  no complaints there!  but, with respect to the <mark>New Yorker</mark>, which was voted the best traditional pizza in the world, i felt that the ricotta cheese and <mark><mark>Tomato Sauce</mark></mark> were overpowering and in too much supply, compared with the amount of sliced mozzarella, sliced house link sausage, garlic, <mark>Sausage and Peppers</mark> that shared the stage; and the crust was much thinner than i prefer.  \n\noverall, from my single experience, although the margherita pizza prepared here can definitely hold its own, even in the las vegas valley alone i would rank the other types of pizza i tried here behind dom demarco's, cosmopolitan's secret pizza, metro pizza, settebello's, biaggio's, and enzo's.\n\nthe place has a nice spacious and informal ambiance, although it is rather dark inside.  besides a large bar, white butcher paper is spread on white formica and black-edged tables.  our server allie provided friendly and very helpful service.  \n\nthe pizza sampled here was not at all bad.  it just wasn't as great as i thought it would be.\n\n3-1/2 stars overall!",

            "i have been told for the longest time that when in  vegas, downtown is not the place to be. really? how wrong! we ventured into downtown with friends when they exclaimed, \"omg.. pizza rock, that place is awesome, we ate there in sacramento! \"  really? okay, gotta try it. \nwe had small pizzas each, i had the fresh mozzarella with a very light and delicate <mark><mark>Tomato Sauce</mark></mark> and it was perfection.  i did not try the other pizzas my husbands or our friends, that would have meant i had to share mine. no way! everybody liked what they ate, we liked the food the service and the bar vibe. pizza and beer something so simple but most dont get it right. pizza rock does and we will be back.", 
            "we had a great lunch at pizza rock.  the salad was fresh and cold, the balsamic vinaigrette was very flavorful.  we had \"the butcher\" (all meat) pizza which was outstanding!  piled high with meats yet the crust was still thin and crispy.  the <mark><mark>Tomato Sauce</mark></mark> tasted like freshly made and was able to be tasted even with all the different italian meats.\nour server summer was very friendly, helpful and had great recommendations.  she checked in with us often and kept our drinks fresh.\nthe ambiance is lively and energetic.\nhighly recommend pizza rock during your lv visit!", 
            "the <mark>Cal Italia</mark> is heaven on a plate - i never knew i wouldn't miss <mark><mark>Tomato Sauce</mark></mark> on a pizza.  some pizzas here are better than others, but this is the best pizza in town.   the calamari is delicious.  i don't know why i keep ordering the garlic bread because every time i get it, it is a little bland, and there is no salt to be found on the table...ugh.\n\nthe best part of the meal on saturday night was the service by sommer!  she was, far and away, the best server i've had in years...anywhere!  she was five-star service all the way, and she explained everything thoroughly.  i need a copy of the weekly staff schedule so i can come in and sit with sommer every time!!!!  she is spectacular!  \n\nand pizza rock plays the best music!", 
            "pizza did not rock.  we ate four slices of the worst margarita pizza ever.  the <mark><mark>Tomato Sauce</mark></mark> was overwhelming and the mozzarella was clumpy... all on a soggy slice with slightly burnt crust.  we left half of the sad margarita pizza on the table.  beyond that, the service was cool, and the atmosphere fun.", 
            "little did i know, the rock part of the name does not refer to what they cook the pizza on, but the actual ambience and theme of the place. it is rock n' roll themed, complete with a live vj the night i went. the vj of the night played a lot of songs from the 90s, and it was actually really cool to see how they inspired the current songs. however, this makes for a rather loud experience, and we could barely talk to each other during dinner.\n\nwe got the famous margherita pizza, and a sausage pizza (the <mark>Sam Giancana</mark>). the pizzas were decent -- each of us had our own preference, mine being the margherita. the crust was thin and chewy, and the <mark><mark>Tomato Sauce</mark></mark> was delicious. i would just mop up the <mark><mark>Tomato Sauce</mark></mark> on its own.\n\nhowever, combining the service, ambiance, and food, it's not really worth the price. it's like you're paying your way into a very, very expensive frat party.", 
            "i enjoy going to pizza rock mainly to sample the culinary diversity and taste the creativity bestowed upon and old comfort food called pizza. i had the chance to taste multiple items on the menu. the new york style, the american style, the sicilian style and the classic old world italian pizza are to die for. the chicago and the napolitano style are average. frankly the best naples style pizza is still settebello. the <mark><mark>Tomato Sauce</mark></mark> is excellent so is the non  pizza items on the menu. also i like their extensive beer selection. the decor and ambiance are good. the service i had diverse and contrasting experiences. food 9/10\ndecor 9/10 service 7/10\ntotal 25/10.", 
            "i have a hard time finding good pizza in vegas and so far i have only found 2 places i love everything about their pizza at and this on my top 2. \n\n<mark>Calamari Fritti</mark>* 13\ntraditional or calabrese style with \ncalabrese aioli and marinara dipping sauces\n\ngreat dipping sauces and good calamari. pricey for an appetizer. \n\n<mark>Beer Battered Fried Artichokes</mark> 8.5\nwith calabrese aioli\n\nhmm wish it had more than 2 pieces, this was delicious!\n\n<mark>New Yorker</mark> 23\nwinner, best traditional in the world, vegas\nsliced mozzarella, <mark><mark>Tomato Sauce</mark></mark>, sliced house link sausage, \ngarlic, pepperoni, ricotta\n\nthe ricotta was not how i usually see ricotta on a pizza. this was whipped and light and i can't say i was a huge fan of it, but as you can see i still give the place 4 stars. if the ricotta was not whipped and so soft, i would have liked it thicker if that makes sense. it would have been absolute perfection of a pizza! \n\nthe pepperoni was top notch, and this is coming from someone who hates pepperoni. i never get pepperoni on pizza. it was small, crispy, and tasty. although a bit greasy, nowhere near what i think of when i think of pepperoni. i am just glad i tried what real pepperoni should be and now i can't say i hate pepperoni. sausage, i would never ever choose sausage on a pizza but i was with my friend and hubby and majority rules. well, this sausage was really good. i rarely ever say that about sausage or any meat on my pizza. the combinations of flavors on this pizza was perfect. the toppings were spread out perfectly getting a bite of almost everything in each bite. the dough was perfect and cooked to perfection, also tasted good and i ate the crust. this pizza dough was exactly the pizza i like. \n\nthe service was very good for being as crowded as they were. i was actually surprised by the good service we got with that many people in the restaurant.  our waiter was so friendly and came around just the right amount of times. i did not need to hunt him down for more water, and he did not come often enough that it was annoying. \n\ni was expecting rock music since they are called pizza rock, but i did not hear rock music. i heard music that reminded me of skating at the skating rink in junior high. i enjoyed it, but it was really really really loud. i could not hear my friend who was sitting right in front of me. \n\none of their downfalls for me is their location. it works for them though and i am sure brings the great business. i am just being selfish and prefer to go to restaurants not on the strip or not in downtown.  the wait was a one hour wait (i hate waiting for food) and they were extremely packed! i saw bachelorette parties, wedding parties, large parties, and all kinds of interesting people (people who looked dressed up for a marathon, literally ran the marathon then came in for pizza? love that). it was a tourist crowd for sure. parking is a bit of pain coming from someone who got spoiled by vegas' easy parking. but, it won't stop me from coming, it just is more of a \"hassle\" being in downtown area near fremont. i wish they would open one in downtown summerlin *hint hint*. \n\nall of their pizzas look amazing and i can't wait to try the prosciutto and pear, <mark>Clam and Garlic</mark> (brings back childhood memories of clam pizza on venice beach-i have not had clam pizza since and would love to try theirs), <mark>Cal Italia</mark>, and more. \n\n-1 star only because music was too loud, waits are long, ricotta was weird to me, and a bit pricey. it won't stop me from coming back because i really enjoyed the majority of everything in this restaurant, specifically the pizza. \n\ni did get a yelp check in offer and was very happy about that!!"

            "today is day one of the week long grand opening for pizza rock!  so excited to hear another new establishment has moved downtown!  what's even better was i heard they were showcasing their menu for the public and fine tune the overall experience for the actual opening on saturday.  originally, we heard you needed reservations to eat there for free this week, however, a coworker mentioned to us that folks working downtown will be able to roll in without reservations and be seated for dinner.  this was a perfect opportunity for a couple of us to have a nice dinner after a hard day's work!\n\nthe restaurant is on the corner of ogden and 3rd st, attached to the mob bar and triple george saloon.  right away, you notice the huge \"pizza rock\" sign from the outside, bordered by flame artwork.  when you enter, there's a nice seating area with a very friendly hostess station.  everyone was super excited to greet you and take your name.  because of the grand opening, we were able to walk around the restaurant and take a look at the decor.  to the right of the hostess stand was the pizza takeout window with a viewable kitchen.  pretty cool.  after the seating area, the main focal point of the restaurant is the life sized semi truck in the middle of the dining area.  super cool!  it serves as a multi purpose art.  aside from the obvious attention grabber, it's the new dj station and serves to break up the bar area and dining area.  wow! the bar is huge and gorgeous!  lots of metal art accents around it.  lots of exposed brick around the restaurant.  they even have little private coves for seating in the dining area if you want to entertain that romantic date or have an intimate family dinner.  lots going on and it all seems to work.  \n\nwhen we were greeted by our server, shirley, we were informed of a couple of things:  they didn't have pasta, they didn't have bread, they didn't have sausage and they didn't have steak.  kind of bummed about it but everything else was free so i couldn't really complain.  shirley was a bit flustered as i expected on day one.  she quoted the wrong price for wine, ordered our food at different times which resulted in a lot of waiting and found herself making multiple trips to the table, because of the lack of efficiency.  i completely understand.  first day jitters are a given.  she had a great personality and that ended up going a long way in my book.\n\nfor dinner, here's what we got:\n\n<mark>Classic Caesar</mark>, normally for $10.00:  hearts of romaine, homemade caesar dressing, house croutons and shaved pieces of parmigiano-reggiano.  definitely a shareable dish.  i think this could comfortable feed 3 people as their first course.  lots of fresh ingredients, but i didn't have a few issues with this salad.  the croutons were way too toasted and very crunchy.  the dressing, as being the star of the dish was way too tangy.  they made it with a lot of anchovies.  now i'm a huge fan of homemade caesar dressing but this was way too overpowered with anchovies.\n\nmargherita pizza, normally for $15.00:  this pizza was a 2007 world pizza cup winner in italy!  hand mixed dough using imported flour and proofed in wood boxed imported from italy.  wow.  san marzano tomatoes, mozzarella cheese, basil, extra virgin olive oil and <mark>Sea Salt</mark>.  the dough from the crust was amazing but the crust turned out a little burnt and had a slightly bitter taste.  the sauce was one of the stars of the show, nice and creamy.  mozzarella was flavorful and there were a lot for a margherita, which was awesome.  the only critique was the basil.  not enough to taste that element which makes a great pie. \n\ndowntown pizza, normally for $19.00:  wow, lots going on!  mozzarella, pepperoni, salami, bacon, chives, mushrooms, read onions, bell peppers, olives, <mark><mark>Extra Cheese, Pepperoni, or Italian Fennel Sausage</mark></mark> and <mark><mark>Cherry Tomato</mark></mark>.  think of it as an upgraded supreme.  with all these ingredients, there was no lack of flavor!  wow loved the flavor punch.  my only feedback was the crust was too thin for this pizza.  it couldn't support the amount of toppings.  it became soggy real fast and we ended up losing a lot of the toppings on the table.  \n\nmanhattan calzone, normally for $12.00:  stuffed with meatballs, mozzarella, ricotta <mark>Clam and Garlic</mark>.  as my friend put it, you would pay 12 bucks f<mark>Classic Pepperoni or Cheese</mark> and bread.  lots of cheese.  omg, it was everywhere.  i personally don't think ricotta is needed.  maybe use a lot more meat to balance out the cheese.  holy cheese!  \n\nduring this week, all menu food items are free.  our entire bill was comped which was the best part of the evening.  please remember to tip your servers great!  this review, i've created, is to give the best and most valuable feedback, so this place thrives downtown.  just the ambiance alone will take them far.  i will certainly be back to try other items of the menu.  next time, i'm hitting the steak and pasta hard!", 
            "went to pizza rock tonight with my wife, daughter, and a family friend.  while i was aware they have an extensive menu, it was such a pleasant evening we wanted to eat outside.  pizza rock has a nice outdoor dining area adjacent to an ordering window that faces the alley at the grand in downtown off 3rd street.  \n   \nwe went up to the window to order, but since we weren't 100% sure on what we wanted to order we went just inside the entryway to place our orders, since it's a bit quieter and we could here the servers/cooks better.  they had several varieties of pizzas to choose from all ready to eat similar to other pizza-by-the-slice restaurants.  i ordered 2 pepperoni slices, my wife got a pepperoni and a cheese slice, and the kids each got a slice of pepperoni.  \n\nthe prices were reasonable my wife's and my 4 slices total and 2 sodas came to $22 which was about what i had planned on spending for a meal for 2.  the slices are very large, larger then other slices i've had from any other pizza-by-the-slice restaurant.  it was just enough to be a full meal without being too much.  the servers were very friendly and helpful too - quick and efficient.  \n\nwe ate out in the aforementioned outdoor dining area, and had a great time together.  the location was fun, with many people coming and going, and the music from the fremont experience was keeping us rocking in our seats.  the pizza was hot and tasty.  i give the pizza 3 out of 5 stars, and the atmosphere, locale, and staff the 4th star.  \n\ni'm more partial to a new york style crust, a slightly thicker than cracker crust.  pizza rock was the extra thin crust style which is not my personal favorite.  the cheese was good, but average and the <mark>Pepperoni</mark> flavorful but lacking any real oomph.  the best part for me was the sauce, which was a very light, and not overly tomato-ish which i find sbarro's sauce to be.  not my personal favorite, but quite good overall. \n\ni would go back for slices at pizza rock, as we all had a blast and the pizza was good.", 
            "this is a bit of a mixed review. on the good side, this place is fairly new, and the ambiance is fantastic. the menu is quite well put together, and the pizza is a great nyc-style pie. they also offer chicago-style, but that, honestly, did not look very authentic. when we got our pizza to go, it was great tasting and reminded me of my time spent in manhattan. i would return to this place based on that alone. the small <mark>Pepperoni</mark> that have the reddish-yellow grease running are awesome. if you're from the east, it's known as margarita pepperoni...at least where i'm from. toppings were ample and the crust was tasty too!\n\nnow for the down side. we returned to this place for a take-out pizza after walking around the area to see all the new businesses and a new casino. we ordered from the convenient walk-up window directly on 3rd st. fantastic for passer-byes to grab a quick slice. so i ordered and paid. they said it would be 7 minutes. ok. twenty minutes later, we went inside. they \"forgot\" to make our pizza. they offered me a \"free\" pepperoni pizza that was ready. how would this be free? i had already paid more for additional toppings. i said no, thank you. i'd like a fresh one. they offered a slice of pizza and a drink while i waited. i accepted that. all-in-all, we waited 45 minuted for a regular pizza order. i was on the verge of asking for my money back and leaving just as the pizza came out. \n\nwe did have a drink at the bar. quite a fun bar, and the service was great here. personable bartenders and reasonable prices. worth stopping in if you're looking for a refresher!\n\noverall, the pizza quality and taste was excellent. unfortunately, due to the incident i encountered, i feel i can only give a 3-star rating. if you go, you're sure to enjoy great pizza...just don't be in a rush. that won't happen.", 
            "so its time to update my last review for pizza rock.  i must say once i posted my last yelp review  the owner, trevor responded to me immediately-within hours of the post.  he was entirely all over the issue, asking for details and assured me that all issues would be addressed which is all that i had hoped for. \n \nmy second visit was quite the opposite of my last experience and i was anticipating some kind of issues.  first off,  it was new years eve and second we had a reservation for a party of 12.  we started out with 10 people and added 2 more the day before with no problem.  when we arrived a few of us went to the bar to order a drink anticipating  to wait a little bit before being seated.  the bartender (i didn't get his name) was more than helpful and a very cool guy with corona shaped new years glasses. ;)   amazingly we were seated within 5 minutes as the other people around us were looking at over an hour wait-because they didn't have reservations.  i highly recommend the reservations-especially on a major holiday.  immediately we were greeted by our server anisa with a smile and excitement that we were there and she was ready to help us in any way possible.  i must say i was greatly surprised at the service we received with all the factors i mentioned above.  anisa was both personable and attentive that we hardly realized that she was serving other several tables.  a simple thing that makes you a super server-unfortunately not everyone can have that talent.   drinks were flowing and we all ordered with 3 or 4 split checks without any issues.  for 5 of us we ordered the <mark>New Yorker</mark> and the <mark>Cal Italia</mark> pizzas.  the <mark>New Yorker</mark> is the most amazing pizza i have ever had...that is what we ordered the last time so you know it has to be good.  it is topped with sausage and little <mark>Pepperoni</mark>....but my favorite part was the super creamy ricotta strategically placed on top where you could spread it around with your fork to savor a little on every bite.  yum.  the <mark>Cal Italia</mark> had prosciutto and a balsalmic drizzle  that had a flavor like none other.  seriously between the two pizzas we were 100% satisfied and all was gone except for one slice in the end.  not too bad for 5 people.  others ordered <mark>Spaghetti and Meatballs</mark> (it was gigantic), lasagna (which my man said he may have to order next time-it looked fabulous), the romana  ii (which gives you a little variety and its big enough to share).  everyone was very happy with their food and we left full and tipsy. =)\n\nnow we did have a small incident where one of my guests spilled a whole glass of ice water all over me.  it could have been worse right??   anisa, even though it wasn't their fault, comp'ed us a pizza just for the inconvenience which was definitely not expected by any means.  we definitely were pleased with  our server so much that we will ask for her the next time we visit.\n\nall i can say is finally some good quality food downtown.  we've been waiting a long time for some good eats out there.  you can bet that's where we will be eating while we are down there.  thank you trevor, for listening to my concerns and working out the kinks.  i believe an honorable owner is one that listens to the customer and strives to correct the issues no matter how big or small they may be.  and thanks to anisa for making our new years eve dinner a special one to remember.  happy new year pizza rock - my new years resolution is to see you often in 2014.  cheers!", 
            "their pizza is out of this world. that's all you need to know.\n\nmy first visit was during yelp helps week and it was a great setting to try this eatery since there were so many of us, which meant that we had the opportunity to try so many different pies (of course, that also meant we were stuffed!). that night, i tried eight of their pies, a couple appetizers, desserts, and a cocktail. everything was so good that i returned just four days later with my fiance and friend hally!\n\nduring my return visit, i had to order the margherita ($16) again. the dough is hand-mixed with san felice flour and proofed in neapolitan wood boxes, then it's topped with san marzano tomatoes, mozzarella, fior di latte, basil, evoo, and <mark>Sea Salt</mark>. finally, it's baked in a 900-degree wood stefano ferrara oven. it's limited to 73 pies daily (although i heard they've gotten no where near that amount yet) and it won the world pizza cup in naples, italy. true neopolitan pizza! \n\nthe three of us also shared the downtown ($19): pepperoni, molinari salami, bacon, chives, mushrooms, red onions, bell peppers, <mark>Black Olives</mark>, <mark><mark>Extra Cheese, Pepperoni, or Italian Fennel Sausage</mark></mark>, <mark><mark>Cherry Tomato</mark></mark>; which is one of their \"american originals\" pizzas that all feature <mark><mark>Tomato Sauce</mark></mark>, mozzarella, and a rustic medium crust, baked in a gas brick oven at 550 degrees. as well as the <mark>Honey Pie</mark> ($17): quail hollow farm honey, calabrese peppers, <mark>Green Onions</mark>, mozzarella, piave cheese, fried <mark><mark>Caramelized Onions</mark></mark>, serrano peppers; one of their \"california\" pizzas that use caputo flour and baked in a 900-degree wood fire oven. \n\nthe downtown reminded me of a \"supreme/deluxe\" pizza, but definitely better. i had tried the <mark>Honey Pie</mark> during the first visit and although it wasn't one of my favorites that evening, i came to appreciate its flavors the second time around. i also tried their <mark>Classic Caesar</mark> salad ($10) and it was tasty. for drinks, i tried the strawberry fields martini ($9.50): stoli strawberry, strawberry puree and a hint of mint and hally ordered the moscow mule ($12): stoli vodka, ginger beer, and fresh squeezed lemon juice. both really delicious cocktails. \n\nfrom both visits, my favorite pizzas are the margherita, <mark>Honey Pie</mark>, and <mark>New Yorker</mark> and i absolutely loved the sweet nothing cocktail, so good. i didn't care for the <mark>Calamari Fritti</mark>, rosemary garlic fries, or the mastunicola pizza. anyway, i could eat that margherita pizza every day. it's that good. i have to keep telling myself to not order it, just so i can try their other delicious concoctions (i have my eyes on the <mark>Pizza Campari</mark>, <mark>Clam and Garlic</mark>, and proscuitto e pomodorini). hands down, definitely my favorite pizza joint now (sorry grimaldi's). but seriously, award-winning pies, five different pizza ovens, quality ingredients - you're convinced right?\n\nparking is best on the surrounding streets like on casino center blvd (meters take credit cards, yay, but you can only pay hourly at $1/hour) or free valet at the downtown grand (super easy and close). oh, and don't forget your locals discount!! win.", 
            "love this place, was excited to have some gluten free pizza tonight so i called to place a pick up order. the hostess transferred me to a gentleman who barley spoke english and was literally unable to take my order. he couldn't understand that i was trying to order 2 seperate pizzas and when i asked him about desserts he suggested garlic bread <mark>Classic Pepperoni or Cheese</mark> sticks. when i explained to him those were side dishes and i wanted deserts... he told me i was wrong.   i literally hung up in frustration after arguing with this guy for 5 minutes.  nothing at all against hispanics, my husband is hispanic... but why the fuck did the english speaking hostess transfer me to someone uncapable of holding a conversation in english?! fail pizza rock. fail.  you lost my business tonight.", 
            "tasty <mark>Classic Meatballs</mark>, and...\n\n5-stars for the chicago cracker thin pizza. this is the only pizza to get here imo! i've had it twice now over the course of 3 separate visits. \n\ngetting the chicago cracker thin '<mark>Old Chicago</mark>' style means it comes with: <mark><mark>Tomato Sauce</mark></mark>, mozzarella, provolone, garlic, <mark>Extra Cheese, Pepperoni, or Italian Fennel Sausage</mark>, sliced meatballs, ricotta, romano and oregano. perfect! the cracker-thin crust is spot-on and just like my favorite hole-in-the-wall pizza joint near midway airport in chicago. it comes out perfectly toasty and savory, and cut into squares as it should be. you will not feel stuffed, just satisfied.\n\nif you're up in the air as to which style pizza to get because there are so many to choose from, you gotta pick the chicago cracker thin pizza. walking through the restaurant on the way to the men's restroom and back, i wish everyone had a chicago cracker thin pizza on their pizza racks instead of the more traditional pies they chose. from the looks of it, the average person likes bready pizza with pepperoni on it. or at least that's what they think they like.\n\nchicago cracker thin. the only way i rock pizza rock.", 
            "ok pizza rock, you have come full circle in my eyes. maybe it was just learning your menu and what worked for me. with so many types of pizza i was bound to love some/ hate some but i've found my jam. the chicago style thin crust pizza is just the stuff i ordered growing up. so good and loaded with <mark>Extra Cheese, Pepperoni, or Italian Fennel Sausage</mark> and spicy sausage. perfect! \ni have also discovered the happy hour menu and it's probably my favorite hh menu around town. 3 huge meatballs for $3 and a 1 topping personal pizza for $5 or specialty pizza for $7. well drinks $3! seriously. awesome. oh and the staff is always super friendly, especially at the bar.",

            "while i've been here more since my last review in june, i went twice last week because the person i was with had not been there yet. after the first time, we were back the very next day.  we had the <mark>New Yorker</mark> the first day which was <mark>Extra Cheese, Pepperoni, or Italian Fennel Sausage</mark>, and ricotta dollops on it. amazing!  i'm actually starting to like the thinner crust more and more each time i visit.  no need for me to divulge in thick crust.   the second day, he got the same pizza, and i had the chicken parmesan. the chicken was cooked perfectly, the crust around it was crispy and perfect, sauce <mark>Mac and Cheese</mark> all delish. the only thing i didn't like was the bucatini pasta under it. it's quite thick and either wasn't cooked long enough, or that's just how it is...either way, i wasn't a fan so if i do order that again, i'll go for a different type of pasta.",

            "i'm a huge fan of tony gemingani so it was only a matter of time, with me being a frequent visitor to vegas, that i would visit pizza rock over in downtown vegas. \n\nthe menu is virtually the same from tony's pizza napolitana in sf.  it includes his famous award winning margherita which is cooked in under 2 minutes along with his vast assortment of pizzas from ny style, romana, california style, and gluten-free.  and it also includes his famous meatballs and pasta dishes as well.  don't forget to check out his burgers too.\n\nsame menu, different setting and in this case, a very different setting where instead of the traditional italian restaurant look from tony's in sf, it's more of a heavy metal rock theme inside here which is quite fitting for vegas actually.  that being said, the pizza is really top notch.  and although i've been to tony's in sf a few times, there are still a lot of things on the menu that i still haven't tried.  my friends and i decided on their <mark>Cal Italia</mark> and the <mark>Honey Pie</mark>.\n\n<mark>Cal Italia</mark> -- http://bit.ly/1bgftsf\ngold medal winner - food network pizza champions challenge\nasiago, mozzarella, imported gorgonzola, sweet fig preserve, prosciutto di parma, \nparmigiano-reggiano, <mark>Balsamic Reduction</mark> \nalthough i've been to tony's three times, this is actually my first time trying his prize winning <mark>Cal Italia</mark>.  it's a very interesting pie in both looks and flavor.  very sweet and savory from the figs and balsamic and prosciutto.  i really dug this pie and would definitely order it again next time i come back to either here or at tony's in sf.\n\n<mark>Honey Pie</mark> -- http://bit.ly/1kbvpvu\nquail hollow farm honey, calabrese peppers, <mark>Green Onions</mark>, mozzarella, piave cheese, \nfried <mark><mark>Caramelized Onions</mark></mark>, serrano peppers\ni've had this pie before at tony's in sf and i ordered it again to share with my friends in vegas so they can try it for the first time.  it's a very unusual pie that has a very sweet and savory flavor with a little spicy kick to it.  if you've ever had a deep fried wonton at a chinese restaurant and dip it in sweet and sour sauce, that's probably the most similar taste that i can compare this pizza to.  although the caramelized fried onions were a little burned, it still tasted delicious.  but for some reason, i wasn't tasting the honey.\n\none honorable mention i recommend from is their <mark>Burrata Burger</mark>.  i didn't have this at pizza rock but i've had it at tony's in sf.  i think it's very underrated because it's almost always overshadowed by the pizzas and everything else.  you get a 1/2 lb burger with burrata cheese and crispy prosciutto and it comes with a generous pile of parmesan garlic fries  (http://bit.ly/1epxy9t). definitely worth trying out!  \n\ni think what i like best is that the wait time at pizza rock is considerably shorter than it's older bother in sf where the wait time for a table can be at the least close to 2 hours.  though that could change if good word of mouth goes around.  it looks like pizza rock is off to a great start and with its extensive menu and popularity growing, i can see it doing very well in downtown vegas.",

            "hands down the best pizza in vegas- and it's probably not close. it breaks the mold of gangster inspired stuffy pizza joints (prevalent in vegas) where the godfather soundtrack plays on repeat all day and every pizza comes with 35lbs of cheese on it. \n\ni had not been to pizza rock before last night. i had been to tony's in sf (another location with the same owner) so i knew how good it was going to be but somehow just never got around to it- shameful i know. it is located downtown just outside of the ruckus. it is across the street from the grand hotel and casino and you can valet park there to attend the restaurant.\n\nwe made a reservation but it didn't look like it was necessary for a sunday night. as we were being lead to our table it took every bit of restraint i could muster to not snatch slices off the many delicious looking pizzas we walked by. the decor is very orange county chopper-esque and the music is a lot of rock from the 90's which is good for the newly over 30 and old crowd. also when i checked in on yelp i got a 15% of coupon so make sure you do that. \n\nthe food\n\nwe got two pizzas since we couldn't decide. we had gotten <mark>The Butcher 'All Meat'</mark> appetizer in sf and it was great but we decided to skip it and try for dessert. \n\n<mark>Cal Italia</mark>- this was the pizza we had in sf and it has haunted us ever since. it is a white style pizza with prosciutto and <mark>Sweet Fig Preserves</mark>, sprinkled with balsamic vinegar. it sounds pretty weird i know but it is insanely good.  the pizza rock version did not disappoint. \n\n<mark>The Ogden</mark>- this had olive, <mark>Goat Cheese</mark>, <mark>House Made Honey and Calabrese Sausage</mark> on a white pizza. i know what you are thinking \"two white pizzas?\"- and yes we went there. this was not quite as good as the <mark>Cal Italia</mark>- but still good. it could of been improved by adding some more <mark>Goat Cheese</mark>- some of the pieces had quite a bit, others almost none.\n\nchicken parm- i didn't get this unfortunately- someone at the table next to me did. it looked so good i strongly considered cracking his skull open like a coconut and taking it before going on the lamb. \n\nthey have so many other unique flavors of pizza i will definitely be going back in order to try as many as possible. \n\n<mark>Mud Pie</mark>- i saw someone else get this dessert and had to get it. it comes with some awesome flavored whip cream (grand marnier?) that is sort of orange tasting- highly recommend.",

            "today is day one of the week long grand opening for pizza rock!  so excited to hear another new establishment has moved downtown!  what's even better was i heard they were showcasing their menu for the public and fine tune the overall experience for the actual opening on saturday.  originally, we heard you needed reservations to eat there for free this week, however, a coworker mentioned to us that folks working downtown will be able to roll in without reservations and be seated for dinner.  this was a perfect opportunity for a couple of us to have a nice dinner after a hard day's work!\n\nthe restaurant is on the corner of ogden and 3rd st, attached to the mob bar and triple george saloon.  right away, you notice the huge \"pizza rock\" sign from the outside, bordered by flame artwork.  when you enter, there's a nice seating area with a very friendly hostess station.  everyone was super excited to greet you and take your name.  because of the grand opening, we were able to walk around the restaurant and take a look at the decor.  to the right of the hostess stand was the pizza takeout window with a viewable kitchen.  pretty cool.  after the seating area, the main focal point of the restaurant is the life sized semi truck in the middle of the dining area.  super cool!  it serves as a multi purpose art.  aside from the obvious attention grabber, it's the new dj station and serves to break up the bar area and dining area.  wow! the bar is huge and gorgeous!  lots of metal art accents around it.  lots of exposed brick around the restaurant.  they even have little private coves for seating in the dining area if you want to entertain that romantic date or have an intimate family dinner.  lots going on and it all seems to work.  \n\nwhen we were greeted by our server, shirley, we were informed of a couple of things:  they didn't have pasta, they didn't have bread, they didn't have sausage and they didn't have steak.  kind of bummed about it but everything else was free so i couldn't really complain.  shirley was a bit flustered as i expected on day one.  she quoted the wrong price for wine, ordered our food at different times which resulted in a lot of waiting and found herself making multiple trips to the table, because of the lack of efficiency.  i completely understand.  first day jitters are a given.  she had a great personality and that ended up going a long way in my book.\n\nfor dinner, here's what we got:\n\n<mark>Classic Caesar</mark>, normally for $10.00:  hearts of romaine, homemade caesar dressing, house croutons and shaved pieces of parmigiano-reggiano.  definitely a shareable dish.  i think this could comfortable feed 3 people as their first course.  lots of fresh ingredients, but i didn't have a few issues with this salad.  the croutons were way too toasted and very crunchy.  the dressing, as being the star of the dish was way too tangy.  they made it with a lot of anchovies.  now i'm a huge fan of homemade caesar dressing but this was way too overpowered with anchovies.\n\nmargherita pizza, normally for $15.00:  this pizza was a 2007 world pizza cup winner in italy!  hand mixed dough using imported flour and proofed in wood boxed imported from italy.  wow.  san marzano tomatoes, mozzarella cheese, basil, extra virgin olive oil and <mark>Sea Salt</mark>.  the dough from the crust was amazing but the crust turned out a little burnt and had a slightly bitter taste.  the sauce was one of the stars of the show, nice and creamy.  mozzarella was flavorful and there were a lot for a margherita, which was awesome.  the only critique was the basil.  not enough to taste that element which makes a great pie. \n\ndowntown pizza, normally for $19.00:  wow, lots going on!  mozzarella, pepperoni, salami, bacon, chives, mushrooms, read onions, bell peppers, olives, <mark><mark>Extra Cheese, Pepperoni, or Italian Fennel Sausage</mark></mark> and <mark><mark>Cherry Tomato</mark></mark>.  think of it as an upgraded supreme.  with all these ingredients, there was no lack of flavor!  wow loved the flavor punch.  my only feedback was the crust was too thin for this pizza.  it couldn't support the amount of toppings.  it became soggy real fast and we ended up losing a lot of the toppings on the table.  \n\nmanhattan calzone, normally for $12.00:  stuffed with meatballs, mozzarella, ricotta <mark>Clam and Garlic</mark>.  as my friend put it, you would pay 12 bucks f<mark>Classic Pepperoni or Cheese</mark> and bread.  lots of cheese.  omg, it was everywhere.  i personally don't think ricotta is needed.  maybe use a lot more meat to balance out the cheese.  holy cheese!  \n\nduring this week, all menu food items are free.  our entire bill was comped which was the best part of the evening.  please remember to tip your servers great!  this review, i've created, is to give the best and most valuable feedback, so this place thrives downtown.  just the ambiance alone will take them far.  i will certainly be back to try other items of the menu.  next time, i'm hitting the steak and pasta hard!", 
            "this place is great!  from the dj spinning classic rock in a semi-truck to the guy spinning pizza, it is a great time.  the garlic bread was cheesy and <mark>Garlic</mark> and the pepperoni pizza was heaven!  the vibe in the restaurant is super cool and the service was top-notch!!", 
            "coconut cooler with a hint of lime (very refreshing, really nice).  coconut curry beer (surprisingly pretty good).  a few blue moons and a spanish fly (really enjoyed the agave nectar).  chorizo mussels served in a spicy <mark><mark>Tomato Sauce</mark></mark> over thick chunks of toasted bread.  battered & fried (not greasy!) large whole artichokes served with a slightly spice aioli (nice size for the price and were slightly addicting).  and this was just the beginning (go ahead, read it again with a smile).\n\nsix hungry, hedonistic gastronomes with an expectation of sumptuous, savory sustenance drawn from a not-so-long-ago memory of amazing pizza in san francisco.  tony's pizza napoletano.\n\nwill tony's pizza be just as good here as it was in san francisco? will the hot (ok, not so hot in november), dry mojave desert climate affect the chewy goodness of tony's pizza crusts?  will two pizza's suffice?  perhaps we should opt for three?  perhaps order two and add a third later?  our friendly server, autumn, suggested placing our order all together due to several large parties.  thank you, autumn!\n\nhere goes:\n<mark>Clam and Garlic</mark> - omg.  best damn clam pizza we've had.  perfect goldilock-sized pieces of clam with garlic generously enveloping every bite.\n\ndiavola - like spicy?  we like spicy.  and we really like diavola!  a spicy pie served with generous chunks of sopressata, mozzarella, and arugala.  and oh yes, a spicy <mark><mark>Tomato Sauce</mark></mark>.  i loved that the arugala was ever so slightly wilted, providing a slight pepperiness without being overly bitter.\n\nqual <mark>Quail Egg White Rose Potato Guanciale</mark> - guanciale is one of our favorite italian pork products.  the rich flavor of the buttery guanciale paired beautifully with the delicate flavors of the potato, quail egg, and mozzarella.  very nicely done!\n\nafter consuming all but a small slice of the clam & garlic and looking at it sadly, then glancing around the table, we realized we were satisfyingly satisfied.\n\nand then autumn brought the dessert menu.  mind you, we were stuffed.  truly.  i just kept thinking how perhaps a bit of gelato would... i don't know, do... something.  so, since we started a coconut trend earlier in the evening i delightedly selected some coconut sorbet.  my sister chose the <mark>Pecan Turnover</mark> - a puff pastry brimming with a sweet maple-pecan crunch and a generous serving of ice cream on top.  the coconut sorbet was a very generous serving of refreshing coconut, and i feel badly and a little sad that i wasted so much.\n\nare you a local?  do you love pizza?  do you like hanging downtown?  me too!  and guess what?!  locals receive a discount.  oh yes.  keep me coming back, baby.  and... they have take out.  i sense mastunicola in my future (by the way, google translator is great for learning how to correctly pronounce italian pizza names).\n\nwelcome to vegas, tony and crew!  we are so glad you came.", 
            "this restaurant was recommended to us by a hotel employee. she said it was the best pizza she had found in las vegas. great menu and awesome beer list. full bar too. good music playing as well. was loud enough to enjoy but not too loud where you couldn't talk. we started with the garlic cheese bread. was good and you could see the garlic pieces on it. yum! then got the <mark>New Yorker</mark> pizza. wow! great flavor, <mark>Garlic</mark> and perfect thin crust. give this place a try!!! and when you do, try to get sarah (red headed waitress) to be your server. her advice was great! she knows her beers and she definitely knows her pizza!", 
            "i've now been to pizza rock twice. first things first, why not 5 stars? basically because i've been here twice and i have never been told that locals receive 20% off their bill. what the heck pizza rock? i don't typically go around asking, hey can i get a local discount? but. when i've been here twice and sung its praises to people - and yet, i've been able to get 20% off but haven't? arg. that ruffles my feathers.\n\non to what is good. happy hour is awesome. personal pizzas, apps, well drinks, and cocktails all on the cheap. my friends and i came here during hh and split all three of the personal pizzas and shared <mark>The Butcher 'All Meat'</mark>. okay. i'm no meatball expert but i think these are delicious. meaty, not bready, and the sauce it comes with compliments very well. i also like that these meatballs are simple. i've had way too many meatballs that have way too much going on with them. another reason i like them: you can cut them down the middle with your fork and they fall away in two pieces, not a bunch of lumpy, gross meat pieces. quality. i think.\n\nother than hh.... i came here with my hubby on a saturday night. luckily they have plenty of 2-top tables so we were seated quickly. service was quick and to the point. our server neither impressed me or upset me so i'll give a neutral rating for service.\n\nwhat we ordered... the <mark>New Yorker</mark> 23. it was the one pizza on the menu i figured my picky (and rather plain-jane) husband would enjoy. the <mark>New Yorker</mark> comes with: sliced mozzarella, <mark><mark>Tomato Sauce</mark></mark>, sliced house link sausage, garlic, pepperoni, ricotta. i asked for the link sausages to be removed and replaced with mushrooms. they were happy to oblige. under the menu it says, \"winner, best traditional, las vegas\". i'm not sure what that means.\n\noverall thoughts on the pizza... i enjoyed it. i love the thin crust style. the mix of cheese and sauce was perfect. pepperoni... okay. the ricotta cheese was an awesome addition, creamy and slightly sweet offsetting the heartiness of the pepperoni <mark>Clam and Garlic</mark>. the flavors were that of a \"normal\" pizza, but with a refinement. i think this was a perfect way to satisfy my more adventurous side and my husband's more traditional side.\n\nfinal decision: mine and my husband's dinner was a bit pricey. although delicious, i would rather go back for the happy hour. hh is your best bet here. and ya, go ahead and throw in the fact you're a local. you'll probably get a discount, unlike me. i'd also be interested in just heading up to the take out window to take a slice to go.\n\nother things i want to go back for:\n\ntheir margherita (only 73 made per day)\n<mark>Clam and Garlic</mark> pizza\n<mark>La Regina</mark> (the gold cup winner)\n<mark>Quail Egg White Rose Potato Guanciale</mark> pizza\n<mark>Cal Italia</mark> (again, this comes as one of the personal pizzas on hh menu and is a foodnetwork winner)\nthe chorizo mussels (app)\nand i would come back again for <mark>The Butcher 'All Meat'</mark>.\n\nlooks, like i'll be making a few return trips. the great thing is, i am so happy there is a good, inventive pizza place so close to where i live now.",

            "this post is overdue, but then again, when am i not behind? a couple weeks ago, we went downtown to try pizza rock. it's owned by tony gemignani you might know him from bar rescue. we also know of him because of his restaurant is san francisco, tonys pizza napoletana. upon returning from our recent trip, i checked to see how the menus compare... they're practically identical. that meant those delicious meatballs could be had right here at home. we only hoped they were just as good. \n\nmy brother joined us and we got there in time for happy hour (mon-fri 3-6; sun-thur 10-close). beers, appetizers and pizzas are discounted (local's discount does not apply). they have a great craft beer selection ($5) so they hooked me on that alone. we each ordered meatballs ($3). <mark>The Butcher 'All Meat'</mark> itself was just as good as those in san francisco, but the sauce was too acidic. hopefully, the kitchen is still tweaking the recipe. still, we enjoyed them. we shared an order of garlic bread ($5). very <mark>Garlic</mark>, but otherwise unmemorable. \n\nwe each ordered a personal pizza from the happy hour menu. this was a great savings and a way to try pizzas we typically wouldn't order. <mark>Frank's True Italian (Thin Crust)</mark> ($7) had pesto garlic and it was topped with mozzarella and <mark><mark>Cherry Tomato</mark></mark>. this was our favorite of the three. \n \nthe pepperoni had some kick ($5) but it was the least liked crust and <mark>Cal Italia</mark> ($7) was too sweet for my liking; it seemed like dessert. however, it came highly recommended from our server and it has won awards. it has sweet fig preserve and topped with mozzarella, gorgonzola, and prosciutto. \n\npizzas i've had at tony's have been far more impressive so next time i'll stick to the regular menu for pizza, but i'll definitely enjoy those $3 meatballs and $5 craft beers again.",

            "pizza rock is off the chart great pizza.  anytime i'm anywhere near downtown vegas, i suggest it as our dining choice.\n\nmy favorite pizza by far is the sausage and stout pizza -- it was introduced around st. patrick's day last march and hadn't been printed on the menu the last time i was in (mid-july) - but i'm hoping it has now.  absolutely amazing.\n\nmy next fave is the <mark>Honey Pie</mark> - it's the perfect combination of sweet and hot with a mixture of honey <mark>Sausage and Peppers</mark>...really good if you like a little kick in your mouth after a bite.\n\nmy friends ordered the <mark>Tomato Pie</mark> on our last visit (not being as adventurous for spice as i am) and it was also great -- very traditionally italian tasting.\n\ni've also had the mac & cheese, <mark>Fried Green Beans</mark> <mark>Clam and Garlic</mark> bread on other visits...so i can highly recommend those.  i wish i could recommend other items, but i love the above three so much that they're all i can ever bring myself to order!\n\nreally looking forward to the opening of the next restaurant in green valley because it's about 15 miles closer to my house!", 
            "pizza rock gets the job done if i am craving a good slice. i waited to write this because i've had multiple different experiences here. first being a yelp elite event, then again a few times with friends and family. overall, i'd say i go with four stars because no matter what small dilemma, the food has pretty much always been on point.\nusually there is a wait. i have had both fast service and super slow service. the variety of items is what i like. you have a ton of types of pizza. all with fresh handmade dough and only the finest ingredients. <mark>The Butcher 'All Meat'</mark> <mark>Clam and Garlic</mark> fries are both solid appetizers. if you like calzone, the one here is worth trying. \nmaybe its the newer popularity of the downtown craze bringing in more tourist, but i would hope for better customer service from the host stand. \nps- try anything with new york, ny, or <mark>New Yorker</mark> in the title.", 
            "how deceiving is the decor in this place? \n\npizza rock on the inside gives off the guy fieri/ affliction look. over-the-top designs and trying really hard to be the cool \"rock-n-roll\" type place to eat pizza. i didn't really notice that much \"rocking\" decor except for in the bathroom, where an airbrushed jimi hendrix face stares at you while you do your business. don't forget the giant semi truck with killer flames on it placed in the middle of the restaurant. nothing says, \"rock-n-roll\" like a truck with flames bro.  \n\nthat being said, the food here was actually very good. i arrived right before happy hour was ending and the bartender was cool enough to get in my food and double my beer order so i could get the happy hour prices. great customer service move, plus she never rushed me and even gave pizza suggestions while i hungrily stared at the large menu. \"i'll have the <mark>Cal Italia</mark> personal pizza and the dogfish head 90 minute ipa\". mmmm, ipa. \n\nalong with my order, i also got a caesar salad which was pretty basic minus the anchovies laid on top, yikes! not my idea of appetizing, but \"when in rome\" or \"pizza rock\" do as they do?...naw...these were promptly picked off and placed on the side. the salad was very large and could easily have been a meal all on it's own or shared. crisp lettuce, shaved parmesan, <mark>Clam and Garlic</mark> croutons, great foodie starting point. the pizzai i ordered, the <mark>Cal Italia</mark>, is an award winning pie according to their menu, in fact it's a gold medal winner from the food network pizza champions challenge. how's that for a stamp of approval!\n\nthis pizza was very tasty from the three different types of cheeses, <mark>Balsamic Reduction</mark>, and <mark>Sweet Fig Preserves</mark>. this crazy combination only got more delightful with the addition of thinly sliced prosciutto di parma, b-o-m-b. there were only four slices of this pizza, but i could have easily eaten eight. the beer just complimented my eating experience, thank goodness i had two in front of me. \n\nthe guy fieri style decor might turn-off your hunger, but as the old saying goes, \"don't judge a book by its cover, only by how tasty its pages are\". i might have made that last part up.", 
            "mmmmm pizza rock! let me start with normally i'm not a huge pizza person. my husband joel on the other hand could eat pizza everyday and be perfectly happy. so when our friends dyanna and brent suggested pizza for our dinner out one saturday night i knew joel would be down! \n\nsince it was saturday night we had to wait 45 minutes. the hostess were nice, but could have given a little more instruction. they said that they'd text me when our table was ready, but the only text i got was one saying we should head to the hostess stand and wait. which we did for 15 more minutes. finally, we were seated. it was a hot night so we ordered lots of water. if your feeling like something other then water they have a fully stocked bar too. plus, real mexican cokes! \n\nnow, let's talk pizza! they have so many! i love that with the description they tell you the degree that they cook the pizza at. from traditional to the unique they have it. dyanna and i both ordered a side salad and they ordered a <mark>New Yorker</mark> and we ordered the cali italia. wow! i really enjoyed the salad dressing which was a super <mark>Garlic</mark> and creamy vinaigrette. our cali italia pizza had a lot of cheeses, <mark>Sweet Fig Preserves</mark>, prosciutto and a <mark>Balsamic Reduction</mark>. it had that total savory, salty and sweet thing going on. a must try if your looking for something non traditional. dyanna and brent's pizza was very classic and joel could not stop talking about it! \n\nthe atmosphere, once seated, had a fun rock n roll vibe! flat screen tvs are all around the restaurant which play old school music videos. yay! they even have a huge truck in the middle of the place that is the  dj booth. along the walls are other rooms that give u some privacy if you have a large group. perfect for a bachelor or bachelorette party. \n\npizza rock has some tasty pizza. it's been on my mind since we went. make sure if your going on the weekend you call ahead for a reservation. also, check yelp for 15% off your check when you check in.

            "was invited here for a friends birthday. never even heard of the place, but was told it was great. after having the food i will have to agree. it's a great place that encourages sharing your food. order 3 or 4 different pizzas and everyone gets to try a different type of pizza. i had the <mark>Clam and Garlic</mark> pizza. just amazing. they've also got one with arugula that was equally amazing. this place is awesome, you owe it to yourself to come here. oh yeah, there's beer too. lots of it.",

            "if you're into pizzas options and styles from all over the world, this is the place for you. aside from the fact that it's nestled in downtown las vegas, where all the strangest people are about, this place was pretty damn good. we ordered gorgonzola fries and spicy calamari to start. the sauce on the fries was out of this world. the spicy calamari was just that...spicy. be prepared. but still pretty good. \n\nfor pizza: we ordered \"the butcher\" and \"ned itty\" (possibly the correct name). the butcher was honestly, just average. but the ned was excellent. <mark>Garlic</mark>. spinach. ricotta. very very good. \n\nenvironment: meh, sub par. it was a mix of a diner and those old pizza places you would go to as a kid. for $20+ a pie, they could have classed this place up just a wee bit. also, as i usually will mention, it was loud. loud music and loud people. be prepared! \n\ni am very happy i went and tried it. i can definitely see myself going back again. but i will have to be in the mood for downtown las vegas.", 
            "finally stopped in here after hearing so much about their meatballs and pizza. it was friday evening so they were pretty busy...but i found a seat at the bar and thus skipped the wait list. started with an order of three meatballs, and they definitely lived up to the hype!  i had no problem downing them and all the sauce they came in.  i only wished i had some garlic bread to go along with them.  garlic bread is on the menu, but i decided to try that on my next visit.  i needed to leave a little room for some pizza.  i decided to get a single slice of pepperoni pizza from the take-out counter up front, and brought that back to the bar.  the slice was huge, however i was not impressed...it was way too greasy for my taste.  perhaps i need to go back and order one of the small pizzas off the menu and try that?!  but more likely i will not get past <mark>The Butcher 'All Meat'</mark> (<mark>Clam and Garlic</mark> bread)!",

            "today is day one of the week long grand opening for pizza rock!  so excited to hear another new establishment has moved downtown!  what's even better was i heard they were showcasing their menu for the public and fine tune the overall experience for the actual opening on saturday.  originally, we heard you needed reservations to eat there for free this week, however, a coworker mentioned to us that folks working downtown will be able to roll in without reservations and be seated for dinner.  this was a perfect opportunity for a couple of us to have a nice dinner after a hard day's work!\n\nthe restaurant is on the corner of ogden and 3rd st, attached to the mob bar and triple george saloon.  right away, you notice the huge \"pizza rock\" sign from the outside, bordered by flame artwork.  when you enter, there's a nice seating area with a very friendly hostess station.  everyone was super excited to greet you and take your name.  because of the grand opening, we were able to walk around the restaurant and take a look at the decor.  to the right of the hostess stand was the pizza takeout window with a viewable kitchen.  pretty cool.  after the seating area, the main focal point of the restaurant is the life sized semi truck in the middle of the dining area.  super cool!  it serves as a multi purpose art.  aside from the obvious attention grabber, it's the new dj station and serves to break up the bar area and dining area.  wow! the bar is huge and gorgeous!  lots of metal art accents around it.  lots of exposed brick around the restaurant.  they even have little private coves for seating in the dining area if you want to entertain that romantic date or have an intimate family dinner.  lots going on and it all seems to work.  \n\nwhen we were greeted by our server, shirley, we were informed of a couple of things:  they didn't have pasta, they didn't have bread, they didn't have sausage and they didn't have steak.  kind of bummed about it but everything else was free so i couldn't really complain.  shirley was a bit flustered as i expected on day one.  she quoted the wrong price for wine, ordered our food at different times which resulted in a lot of waiting and found herself making multiple trips to the table, because of the lack of efficiency.  i completely understand.  first day jitters are a given.  she had a great personality and that ended up going a long way in my book.\n\nfor dinner, here's what we got:\n\n<mark>Classic Caesar</mark>, normally for $10.00:  hearts of romaine, homemade caesar dressing, house croutons and shaved pieces of parmigiano-reggiano.  definitely a shareable dish.  i think this could comfortable feed 3 people as their first course.  lots of fresh ingredients, but i didn't have a few issues with this salad.  the croutons were way too toasted and very crunchy.  the dressing, as being the star of the dish was way too tangy.  they made it with a lot of anchovies.  now i'm a huge fan of homemade caesar dressing but this was way too overpowered with anchovies.\n\nmargherita pizza, normally for $15.00:  this pizza was a 2007 world pizza cup winner in italy!  hand mixed dough using imported flour and proofed in wood boxed imported from italy.  wow.  san marzano tomatoes, mozzarella cheese, basil, extra virgin olive oil and <mark>Sea Salt</mark>.  the dough from the crust was amazing but the crust turned out a little burnt and had a slightly bitter taste.  the sauce was one of the stars of the show, nice and creamy.  mozzarella was flavorful and there were a lot for a margherita, which was awesome.  the only critique was the basil.  not enough to taste that element which makes a great pie. \n\ndowntown pizza, normally for $19.00:  wow, lots going on!  mozzarella, pepperoni, salami, bacon, chives, mushrooms, read onions, bell peppers, olives, <mark><mark>Extra Cheese, Pepperoni, or Italian Fennel Sausage</mark></mark> and <mark><mark>Cherry Tomato</mark></mark>.  think of it as an upgraded supreme.  with all these ingredients, there was no lack of flavor!  wow loved the flavor punch.  my only feedback was the crust was too thin for this pizza.  it couldn't support the amount of toppings.  it became soggy real fast and we ended up losing a lot of the toppings on the table.  \n\nmanhattan calzone, normally for $12.00:  stuffed with meatballs, mozzarella, ricotta <mark>Clam and Garlic</mark>.  as my friend put it, you would pay 12 bucks f<mark>Classic Pepperoni or Cheese</mark> and bread.  lots of cheese.  omg, it was everywhere.  i personally don't think ricotta is needed.  maybe use a lot more meat to balance out the cheese.  holy cheese!  \n\nduring this week, all menu food items are free.  our entire bill was comped which was the best part of the evening.  please remember to tip your servers great!  this review, i've created, is to give the best and most valuable feedback, so this place thrives downtown.  just the ambiance alone will take them far.  i will certainly be back to try other items of the menu.  next time, i'm hitting the steak and pasta hard!", 
            "this place is great!  from the dj spinning classic rock in a semi-truck to the guy spinning pizza, it is a great time.  the garlic bread was cheesy and <mark>Garlic</mark> and the pepperoni pizza was heaven!  the vibe in the restaurant is super cool and the service was top-notch!!",

            "this restaurant was recommended to us by a hotel employee. she said it was the best pizza she had found in las vegas. great menu and awesome beer list. full bar too. good music playing as well. was loud enough to enjoy but not too loud where you couldn't talk. we started with the garlic cheese bread. was good and you could see the garlic pieces on it. yum! then got the <mark>New Yorker</mark> pizza. wow! great flavor, <mark>Garlic</mark> and perfect thin crust. give this place a try!!! and when you do, try to get sarah (red headed waitress) to be your server. her advice was great! she knows her beers and she definitely knows her pizza!", 
            "i've now been to pizza rock twice. first things first, why not 5 stars? basically because i've been here twice and i have never been told that locals receive 20% off their bill. what the heck pizza rock? i don't typically go around asking, hey can i get a local discount? but. when i've been here twice and sung its praises to people - and yet, i've been able to get 20% off but haven't? arg. that ruffles my feathers.\n\non to what is good. happy hour is awesome. personal pizzas, apps, well drinks, and cocktails all on the cheap. my friends and i came here during hh and split all three of the personal pizzas and shared <mark>The Butcher 'All Meat'</mark>. okay. i'm no meatball expert but i think these are delicious. meaty, not bready, and the sauce it comes with compliments very well. i also like that these meatballs are simple. i've had way too many meatballs that have way too much going on with them. another reason i like them: you can cut them down the middle with your fork and they fall away in two pieces, not a bunch of lumpy, gross meat pieces. quality. i think.\n\nother than hh.... i came here with my hubby on a saturday night. luckily they have plenty of 2-top tables so we were seated quickly. service was quick and to the point. our server neither impressed me or upset me so i'll give a neutral rating for service.\n\nwhat we ordered... the <mark>New Yorker</mark> 23. it was the one pizza on the menu i figured my picky (and rather plain-jane) husband would enjoy. the <mark>New Yorker</mark> comes with: sliced mozzarella, <mark><mark>Tomato Sauce</mark></mark>, sliced house link sausage, garlic, pepperoni, ricotta. i asked for the link sausages to be removed and replaced with mushrooms. they were happy to oblige. under the menu it says, \"winner, best traditional, las vegas\". i'm not sure what that means.\n\noverall thoughts on the pizza... i enjoyed it. i love the thin crust style. the mix of cheese and sauce was perfect. pepperoni... okay. the ricotta cheese was an awesome addition, creamy and slightly sweet offsetting the heartiness of the pepperoni <mark>Clam and Garlic</mark>. the flavors were that of a \"normal\" pizza, but with a refinement. i think this was a perfect way to satisfy my more adventurous side and my husband's more traditional side.\n\nfinal decision: mine and my husband's dinner was a bit pricey. although delicious, i would rather go back for the happy hour. hh is your best bet here. and ya, go ahead and throw in the fact you're a local. you'll probably get a discount, unlike me. i'd also be interested in just heading up to the take out window to take a slice to go.\n\nother things i want to go back for:\n\ntheir margherita (only 73 made per day)\n<mark>Clam and Garlic</mark> pizza\n<mark>La Regina</mark> (the gold cup winner)\n<mark>Quail Egg White Rose Potato Guanciale</mark> pizza\n<mark>Cal Italia</mark> (again, this comes as one of the personal pizzas on hh menu and is a foodnetwork winner)\nthe chorizo mussels (app)\nand i would come back again for <mark>The Butcher 'All Meat'</mark>.\n\nlooks, like i'll be making a few return trips. the great thing is, i am so happy there is a good, inventive pizza place so close to where i live now.",

            "i've been meaning to try pizza rock. i learned that they opened another branch in green valley ranch but i figured i must go and try the original location first. \n\nwe went here on a weekend and the place was pretty packed. the host was attentive and seated us right away. i would describe this place as a bar kind of place rather than a restaurant. the music was loud. trying to have a conversation it was a little bit of a challenge. \n\nwe ordered the <mark>White Wine Clams</mark> for appetizers. it was so good! the <mark>Garlic</mark> sauce was perfect for dipping with their complimentary bread. we opted to get the classic margherita pizza. this too was excellent. the crust was perfectly charred which added to the great flavor of the pizza. \n\ni think this is one of the best go-to places in downtown. it is worth the drive just to go try this place.",

            "i kept hearing about this tony guy and his award winning pizzas, i was excited to try a new pizzeria that was getting so much buzz. \n\ngoal was to try one pizza from each of the ovens.\n\nnapoletana - 900 degree wood stefano ferrara. we went with the margherita. this was pretty standard, nothing stood out, i felt it was served a bit cold as well, although michael made a good point, it couldn't been from the photo ops.\n\npizza romana - electric brick oven 700 degrees. we chose the romana iii. it's 3 pizzas in 1. 1/3 was gorgonzola, dates & pecans, <mark>Apples, Honey, Nutella</mark> (this was my favorite) 1/3 was <mark>Sweet Fig Preserves</mark>, prosciutto, gorgonzola, <mark>Balsamic Reduction</mark> (this was my second favorite) and the other portion was ricotta, garlic, basil, linguisa, <mark>Piquante Peppers</mark>. this was a nice option if you have lots of people in your party, you can a piece of each.\n\nclassic italian - gas brick oven 650 degrees. we chose the <mark>Cal Italia</mark>. this was the gold medal winner on the food network, and the winner for jaime w and i. i liked how all the ingredients came together.\n\ncalifornia - 900 degree wood fire oven. we chose the <mark>Quail Egg White Rose Potato Guanciale</mark>. this had a kick, spicy! this was my least favorite of the pizzas, not a fan of eggs on my pizza, but at least i can say i gave it a try. \n\nwe then sampled the <mark>Farmers Market</mark> pizza, weekly special using ingredients from downtown <mark>Farmers Market</mark>, this week it was pumpkin, brown sugar, cinnamon, bacon and topped with dollops of marshmallow. didn't really do anything for me. \n\ndessert, yes we still had room for dessert. <mark>Mud Pie</mark>, <mark>Pecan Turnover</mark> and desert calzone. nothing really excited me. it was all pretty standard. \n\noverall, i wasn't in love with this place. nothing was that spectacular that would make me drive to downtown and attempt to find parking. save this place for the tourists.", 
            "pizza overload!  so many different pies...different ovens...different toppings...no time for all that!\n\ncame with a group of yelpers with big appetites, so we were able to blast our way through quite a bit on the menu!\n\nmy favorite by far was the cal-italia ($18): asiago, mozzarella, imported gorgonzola, sweet fig preserve, prosciutto di parma, parmigiano-reggiano & <mark>Balsamic Reduction</mark>. this was excellent and the highlight of the meal for me! great mix of sweet, savory and vinegar/acidic flavors.  highly recommended :)\n\nanother great choice would be the margherita ($16): san marzano tomatoes, mozzarella fior di latte, basil, evoo and <mark>Sea Salt</mark>. honestly, this was probably the first enjoyable margheria i've had! not usually a fan of this style pie.  whatever they do differently here, i enjoyed...but you may not for the same reasons.\n\n<mark>Quail Egg White Rose Potato Guanciale</mark> ($18): mozzarella, white rose potatoes, chorizo, pork cheek, rosemary, fromage blanc, calabrese peppers & lavender <mark>Sea Salt</mark>. this was surprisingly spicy...a bit over the top, but still enjoyable.  order it knowing it's actually spicy, and you'll do just fine.\n\nromana iii ($32): 1) <mark>Sweet Fig Preserves</mark>, prosciutto, gorgonzola & <mark>Balsamic Reduction</mark>. 2) ricotta, garlic, basil, linguisa & <mark>Piquante Peppers</mark>. 3) gorgonzola, dates & pecans, and <mark>Apples, Honey, Nutella</mark>. interesting combinations here...the only one that didn't really satisfy was the middle portion. a bit spendy, but it's huge and serves 2-4 people.  i'd pass on this one next visit.\n\nfor dessert, we also tried quite a bit.  the best imo was the <mark>Pecan Turnover</mark> : light puff pastry, maple pecan, crunch & coffee ice cream. this was pretty tasty...probably the most enjoyable dessert we tried. came out piping hot too...yum :)\n\napple calzone : brown sugar, cinnamon, caramel & vanilla gelato. this is served with 2 calzones...pretty good overall but nothing extraordinary. \n\nmarket pizza : pumpkin puree, cinnamon, brown sugar, bacon & marshmallows. not really my kind of dessert...perhaps if you are a pumpkin lover?\n\n<mark>Mud Pie</mark> : oreo cookie crust, chocolate ganache, coffee vanilla bean ice cream, hot fudge, caramel & house made whipped cream. this was very frozen...hard as a rock. i enjoyed the cookie crust though. \n\nso it's a hit or miss kinda spot for me.  depending on what you order, your results will vary...for better and worse.\n\npics!", 
            "***check-in and get 15% off your whole meal!***\n\ni found a deal on living social for $29 for 1 craft beer, 1 appetizer, and 1 pizza to share. it was well worth it!!  the total for this portion of our bill was $54!  \n\nwhen we walked in, this place had a nice vibe. the music was a great selection and it was the perfect volume.  we were sat near the bar, but asked to move, so we didn't have to sit on bar stool level table and chairs.  they were very accommodating and moved us no problem. \n\nof course we all ordered beers.  they have a nice selection of drafts, and an even bigger selection of bottles. \n\nwe ordered the salumi & <mark>Salumi & Formaggio Board</mark> for our appetizer. the menu describes it as - assorted salumi & formaggio, fig jam, spicy candied walnuts, rosemary focaccia toast.  it was very good and is a nice bite for 2-4 people. unfortunately, we were so hungry, i forgot to get a picture of it. :p\n\nthen for the pizza, we decided to get our money's worth of the coupon i had and ordered the biggest pizza we could.  lol! \nwe chose the romano ii. it was divided into three section with three different toppings. all three were delicious!  the pizza was thin and crispy and there were plenty of toppings <mark>Mac and Cheese</mark>. \nhere's how the menu describes it...section 1: <mark><mark>Tomato Sauce</mark></mark>, natural casing pepperoni, <mark><mark>Extra Cheese, Pepperoni, or Italian Fennel Sausage</mark></mark>; section 2: pesto, <mark><mark>Caramelized Onions</mark></mark>, <mark>Goat Cheese</mark>, <mark>Roasted Tomatoes</mark>, garlic; section 3: ricotta, garlic, basil, linguisa, <mark>Piquante Peppers</mark>\nsection 1 was perfect for that typical man \"meat lovers\" pizza. section 2 was unique with the sweetness of the <mark><mark>Caramelized Onions</mark></mark> and saltiness of the <mark>Goat Cheese</mark>.  section 3 was my favorite, even though i think they forgot the ricotta. i loved the sweetness of the <mark>Piquante Peppers</mark> (like a roasted red pepper), and the linguisa is very similar to their pepperoni. \n\nduring our meal the gm came over and asked us how we were enjoying it and even told us all about the business, from the encouragement of my aussie friend. \n\nwould definitely go back and will!!!"

            "today is day one of the week long grand opening for pizza rock!  so excited to hear another new establishment has moved downtown!  what's even better was i heard they were showcasing their menu for the public and fine tune the overall experience for the actual opening on saturday.  originally, we heard you needed reservations to eat there for free this week, however, a coworker mentioned to us that folks working downtown will be able to roll in without reservations and be seated for dinner.  this was a perfect opportunity for a couple of us to have a nice dinner after a hard day's work!\n\nthe restaurant is on the corner of ogden and 3rd st, attached to the mob bar and triple george saloon.  right away, you notice the huge \"pizza rock\" sign from the outside, bordered by flame artwork.  when you enter, there's a nice seating area with a very friendly hostess station.  everyone was super excited to greet you and take your name.  because of the grand opening, we were able to walk around the restaurant and take a look at the decor.  to the right of the hostess stand was the pizza takeout window with a viewable kitchen.  pretty cool.  after the seating area, the main focal point of the restaurant is the life sized semi truck in the middle of the dining area.  super cool!  it serves as a multi purpose art.  aside from the obvious attention grabber, it's the new dj station and serves to break up the bar area and dining area.  wow! the bar is huge and gorgeous!  lots of metal art accents around it.  lots of exposed brick around the restaurant.  they even have little private coves for seating in the dining area if you want to entertain that romantic date or have an intimate family dinner.  lots going on and it all seems to work.  \n\nwhen we were greeted by our server, shirley, we were informed of a couple of things:  they didn't have pasta, they didn't have bread, they didn't have sausage and they didn't have steak.  kind of bummed about it but everything else was free so i couldn't really complain.  shirley was a bit flustered as i expected on day one.  she quoted the wrong price for wine, ordered our food at different times which resulted in a lot of waiting and found herself making multiple trips to the table, because of the lack of efficiency.  i completely understand.  first day jitters are a given.  she had a great personality and that ended up going a long way in my book.\n\nfor dinner, here's what we got:\n\n<mark>Classic Caesar</mark>, normally for $10.00:  hearts of romaine, homemade caesar dressing, house croutons and shaved pieces of parmigiano-reggiano.  definitely a shareable dish.  i think this could comfortable feed 3 people as their first course.  lots of fresh ingredients, but i didn't have a few issues with this salad.  the croutons were way too toasted and very crunchy.  the dressing, as being the star of the dish was way too tangy.  they made it with a lot of anchovies.  now i'm a huge fan of homemade caesar dressing but this was way too overpowered with anchovies.\n\nmargherita pizza, normally for $15.00:  this pizza was a 2007 world pizza cup winner in italy!  hand mixed dough using imported flour and proofed in wood boxed imported from italy.  wow.  san marzano tomatoes, mozzarella cheese, basil, extra virgin olive oil and <mark>Sea Salt</mark>.  the dough from the crust was amazing but the crust turned out a little burnt and had a slightly bitter taste.  the sauce was one of the stars of the show, nice and creamy.  mozzarella was flavorful and there were a lot for a margherita, which was awesome.  the only critique was the basil.  not enough to taste that element which makes a great pie. \n\ndowntown pizza, normally for $19.00:  wow, lots going on!  mozzarella, pepperoni, salami, bacon, chives, mushrooms, read onions, bell peppers, olives, <mark><mark>Extra Cheese, Pepperoni, or Italian Fennel Sausage</mark></mark> and <mark><mark>Cherry Tomato</mark></mark>.  think of it as an upgraded supreme.  with all these ingredients, there was no lack of flavor!  wow loved the flavor punch.  my only feedback was the crust was too thin for this pizza.  it couldn't support the amount of toppings.  it became soggy real fast and we ended up losing a lot of the toppings on the table.  \n\nmanhattan calzone, normally for $12.00:  stuffed with meatballs, mozzarella, ricotta <mark>Clam and Garlic</mark>.  as my friend put it, you would pay 12 bucks f<mark>Classic Pepperoni or Cheese</mark> and bread.  lots of cheese.  omg, it was everywhere.  i personally don't think ricotta is needed.  maybe use a lot more meat to balance out the cheese.  holy cheese!  \n\nduring this week, all menu food items are free.  our entire bill was comped which was the best part of the evening.  please remember to tip your servers great!  this review, i've created, is to give the best and most valuable feedback, so this place thrives downtown.  just the ambiance alone will take them far.  i will certainly be back to try other items of the menu.  next time, i'm hitting the steak and pasta hard!", 
            "another great addition to downtown. sorry to all the other pizza joints but this place is legit!! after reading the new opening section i wanted to pizza rock that happens to serve my favorite food(pizza ; ) \n\nwe started out with a caesars salad. it was a decent size that three of us shared as an app. nice crunchy croutons and shave fresh parmigiano reggiano on top. the server offered fresh pepper as he delivered the food.\n \nthe margherita- this was brought out first. the san marzanos tomatoes make this pizza so tasty. the dough is soft and and cooked in perfectly. defiantly reminds me of italy!\n\nclassic italian style- decided on the prosciutto and pomodorini. this was my favorite of the two. the fresh arugula and the <mark><mark>Cherry Tomato</mark></mark> adding some acidity. also this dough had more of a crisp to it. amazing! \n\nservice was excellent. we had plenty of questions and our serve helped along the way. some many more different styles of pizza to try and the other items on the menu as well. i will be back this week", 
            "this post is overdue, but then again, when am i not behind? a couple weeks ago, we went downtown to try pizza rock. it's owned by tony gemignani you might know him from bar rescue. we also know of him because of his restaurant is san francisco, tonys pizza napoletana. upon returning from our recent trip, i checked to see how the menus compare... they're practically identical. that meant those delicious meatballs could be had right here at home. we only hoped they were just as good. \n\nmy brother joined us and we got there in time for happy hour (mon-fri 3-6; sun-thur 10-close). beers, appetizers and pizzas are discounted (local's discount does not apply). they have a great craft beer selection ($5) so they hooked me on that alone. we each ordered meatballs ($3). <mark>The Butcher 'All Meat'</mark> itself was just as good as those in san francisco, but the sauce was too acidic. hopefully, the kitchen is still tweaking the recipe. still, we enjoyed them. we shared an order of garlic bread ($5). very <mark>Garlic</mark>, but otherwise unmemorable. \n\nwe each ordered a personal pizza from the happy hour menu. this was a great savings and a way to try pizzas we typically wouldn't order. <mark>Frank's True Italian (Thin Crust)</mark> ($7) had pesto garlic and it was topped with mozzarella and <mark><mark>Cherry Tomato</mark></mark>. this was our favorite of the three. \n \nthe pepperoni had some kick ($5) but it was the least liked crust and <mark>Cal Italia</mark> ($7) was too sweet for my liking; it seemed like dessert. however, it came highly recommended from our server and it has won awards. it has sweet fig preserve and topped with mozzarella, gorgonzola, and prosciutto. \n\npizzas i've had at tony's have been far more impressive so next time i'll stick to the regular menu for pizza, but i'll definitely enjoy those $3 meatballs and $5 craft beers again.",

            "we came here on a thursday evening and ordered \n1. <mark>Calamari Fritti</mark>, 13\n- traditional or calabrese style with calabrese aioli and marinara dipping sauces \n2. american  original - downtown, 20 \n- mozzarella, pepperoni, molinari salami, bacon, sahhlots, mushrooms, red onions, bell peppers, <mark>Black Olives</mark>, <mark><mark>Extra Cheese, Pepperoni, or Italian Fennel Sausage</mark></mark>, <mark><mark>Cherry Tomato</mark></mark>\n3. soda, unlimited refills, 3\nfor 7 (used the living social deal - $29 for $8 beer, antipasti, and pizza (excludes ny22\")\n\n- parking is pretty lame. we tried binions because they have free parking with validation, but they took out the validation next the cashiers! fail. so there practically isn't anymore free parking on the strip. you gotta eat at their restaurant or actively gamble. $8 for 1.5hrs. shiet...\n- got in around 9pm, seated in a few minutes. sat in the back, next to the bar, right next to a speaker, great place to have a screaming conversation.\n- ran out of sicilian style dough. just our luck. \"just served the last one 15 min ago.\" i guess if we came earlier, we wouldn't have had to deal with that problem. we actually wanted to order <mark>The Mob Boss</mark> pizza instead because the crust is thicker with sicilian style. i'm not much of a fan of \"the potato chip like pizza\" or should i say thin crust. haha \n-because we sat next to a speaker, our server, chelsei, couldn't really hear us over the music. after several ahem, excuse meess....one of them got through, and she handed us utensils and napkins after we got our antipasti. who eats calamari with a fork and towel anyway? haha. come on now...anyway, she was very good at drink refills and attentive thereafter. \n- the calamari was great. we got it half and half. i recommend it bc after i ate a few spicy, i needed to balance it out with one regular. spicy one or calabrese style tasted better. chelsei hooked it up with dat extra dip doe. haha. needed that for the extra dunkers na mmm saying. lol. \n- the downtown was fresh. loved the <mark><mark>Cherry Tomato</mark></mark>, so red. 6 slices. didn't like the uncooked onions. peeled off. wood fire pizza nom! \n\nbreak down of the living social deal...\n- so if you choose the most expensive antipasti, which is  the calamari at $13 and the most expensive pizza, romana, at $35, get the beer $8, then technically, you can get the saving at 48%. \n- i probably should have just saved the deal for another day and just used the yelp check-in promo of 15% off.",

            "i really wanted to like this place as a good pizza joint is hard to find. they have a nice happy hour food menu, but alas the food is less than mediocre. we tried to the gorgonzola fries, <mark>Pancetta & Arugula</mark> salad with chicken, and <mark>Cal Italia</mark> pizza. the gorgonzola fries came lukewarm, all <mark>White Cream Sauce</mark> no  gorgonzola on them. but, for $3 what could one expect. our salad had no flavor and the chicken was dry, not to mention it was bacon and not pancetta. to sum it up, a large plate of greasy under seasoned arugula with <mark>Cherry Tomato</mark> and mozz .... with bacon bits ... seriously ? 18$? our pizza was greasy and didn't taste of any fig as stated on the menu. extremely disappointed, again. our service started out nicely at the bar, but we were with a large party and moved to a table. that's where service went downhill. our food was not even delivered properly, they auctioned  our food off. we never got share plates or even water; basics to any dining experience ... and then we were charged 18% for this lackluster service. we will not be coming back.", 
            "honestly, i wasn't impressed with my entree at all. the noodles are made in house which is nice, but the spaghetti was way too thick. \n\ni ordered the clams in a <mark>White Cream Sauce</mark> for an appetizer and they were great. the waiter said every friday they are shipped fresh and the plate definitely tasted lovely. if it weren't for the appetizer they probably would have received a 2 star. \n\nmy boyfriend ordered the butcher pizza and loved it. full of meat and thin how we like it. \n\nthe service was alright. i had to ask another server to get my waiter at one point. \n\ni'm sure this place is better at a normal hour but i was not impressed. the 4.5 stars bumped my expectations and they were not met.", 
            "when my family told me about pizza rock, i had no idea that i was in for a real treat!  <mark>The Butcher 'All Meat'</mark> appetizer was wonderful!  the marinara sauce is unbelievable!  that is a staple on our items to share, along with the <mark>New Yorker</mark> pizza.  on another note, i must mention that we  dined there the other day for lunch.  our server, jj, was not good at all.  my brother ordered a salad without croutons, (croutons in salad); asked for a glass with my beer (different server, no glass), and ordered the mostaccioli with the marinara sauce, only.  we mentioned that we cannot have <mark>White Cream Sauce</mark> since we have disgestion issues.  when this dish arrived, it came with melted cheese on top, along with a spicy <mark>White Cream Sauce</mark>.  in essence, jj did not hear a word we said in our initial order and acted like he couldn't be bothered.  we had to flagged him down for any of our needs.  we were very disappointed with him."

            "so its time to update my last review for pizza rock.  i must say once i posted my last yelp review  the owner, trevor responded to me immediately-within hours of the post.  he was entirely all over the issue, asking for details and assured me that all issues would be addressed which is all that i had hoped for. \n \nmy second visit was quite the opposite of my last experience and i was anticipating some kind of issues.  first off,  it was new years eve and second we had a reservation for a party of 12.  we started out with 10 people and added 2 more the day before with no problem.  when we arrived a few of us went to the bar to order a drink anticipating  to wait a little bit before being seated.  the bartender (i didn't get his name) was more than helpful and a very cool guy with corona shaped new years glasses. ;)   amazingly we were seated within 5 minutes as the other people around us were looking at over an hour wait-because they didn't have reservations.  i highly recommend the reservations-especially on a major holiday.  immediately we were greeted by our server anisa with a smile and excitement that we were there and she was ready to help us in any way possible.  i must say i was greatly surprised at the service we received with all the factors i mentioned above.  anisa was both personable and attentive that we hardly realized that she was serving other several tables.  a simple thing that makes you a super server-unfortunately not everyone can have that talent.   drinks were flowing and we all ordered with 3 or 4 split checks without any issues.  for 5 of us we ordered the <mark>New Yorker</mark> and the <mark>Cal Italia</mark> pizzas.  the <mark>New Yorker</mark> is the most amazing pizza i have ever had...that is what we ordered the last time so you know it has to be good.  it is topped with sausage and little <mark>Pepperoni</mark>....but my favorite part was the super creamy ricotta strategically placed on top where you could spread it around with your fork to savor a little on every bite.  yum.  the <mark>Cal Italia</mark> had prosciutto and a balsalmic drizzle  that had a flavor like none other.  seriously between the two pizzas we were 100% satisfied and all was gone except for one slice in the end.  not too bad for 5 people.  others ordered <mark>Spaghetti and Meatballs</mark> (it was gigantic), lasagna (which my man said he may have to order next time-it looked fabulous), the romana  ii (which gives you a little variety and its big enough to share).  everyone was very happy with their food and we left full and tipsy. =)\n\nnow we did have a small incident where one of my guests spilled a whole glass of ice water all over me.  it could have been worse right??   anisa, even though it wasn't their fault, comp'ed us a pizza just for the inconvenience which was definitely not expected by any means.  we definitely were pleased with  our server so much that we will ask for her the next time we visit.\n\nall i can say is finally some good quality food downtown.  we've been waiting a long time for some good eats out there.  you can bet that's where we will be eating while we are down there.  thank you trevor, for listening to my concerns and working out the kinks.  i believe an honorable owner is one that listens to the customer and strives to correct the issues no matter how big or small they may be.  and thanks to anisa for making our new years eve dinner a special one to remember.  happy new year pizza rock - my new years resolution is to see you often in 2014.  cheers!", 
            "2 thumbs up! if i had 3 thumbs, that one would be up too! after reading the reviews, i decided to give it a try - and since i was staying right across the street at the grand, it was super convenient. \n\nnice atmosphere, tons of tv's to catch the games and the food - really, really good. be prepared though - the portions are gigantic! you'd better be really hungry - lol.\n\ni usually don't go to the same restaurant when i'm on business trips but i ended up going two nights in a row - it was that good. first night was <mark>Spaghetti and Meatballs</mark>  - <mark>The Butcher 'All Meat'</mark> are fantastic. they actually got better the more i ate. second night was  chicken vesuvio and mashed potatoes - damn good! drinks are on the pricey side but the bartender does them right. and when you are done stuffing yourself silly, fremont experience is a block away so you can go walk it all off!\n\noverall, i would certainly recommend pizza rock and will most definitely come back when i come out to vegas again!", 
            "i just to had to come back here with my fam especially after sampling some of their goodies from a cmye just days before.\n\nso we started with 3 pretty nice sized meatballs for 6 bucks. should of got the 6 for 10 deal because <mark>The Butcher 'All Meat'</mark> were some of the tastiest chunks of beef i have had in a very long time. the marinara sauce that it sits in might as well have been gold because if i wasn't in a public place and was at home, i would have been licking the bowl clean. we also ordered caesar salad for 10 bucks. it was pretty good but for that price, i thought we could have gotten more.\n\nafter going over the menu, we wanted to try the world famous margherita pizza. here's the actual description from their very own menu:\n*margherita 16\n (limit of 73 made per day) world pizza cup winner naples, italy\n dough hand mixed using san felice flour, proofed in neapolitan wood boxes\n san marzano tomatoes, mozzarella fior di latte, basil, evoo and <mark>Sea Salt</mark>\n\nas quickly as we were excited, our server told us the cold hard truth. there was no more! :( \nso much for our excitement. it does say in limited to 73 per day. what a weird number. i think i will ask next time why.\n\nin the mean time, we decided to go simple and ordered a classic thin crust pepperoni pizza for 14 bucks. this was cooked in a gas brick oven for 550 degrees. this thin crust features <mark><mark>Tomato Sauce</mark></mark>, mozzarella, <mark>Sausage and Peppers</mark>. its so simple that its great.\n\nas a side, i wanted to try their wood fired asparagus for 5  bucks. now this was sheer disappointment. what they give you is like half of what you would get at the supermarket so the portion size was definitely lacking. as for the taste, well lets put it this way, any time you cook vegetables, especially grilling them, you just want to cook it just enough for it to be a little bit crispy still. in this case, it was limp and almost to the point that it was soggy. so yeah, it was overcooked.\n\nservice was on point. we didn't need to ask for anything. refills were constant and we were constantly checked up on.\n\nthe only negatives that stood out for me was the limp asparagus and the music being played. i loved what they were playing but i thought the volume was a bit loud. i only bring this up because even though my wife sat across from me, after our first conversation after sitting down, we had to repeat just about every other word. as i looked around, it didn't seem like anybody else was being bothered by it so i just left it alone.\n\noverall, i am definitely coming back here for great pizza <mark>Spaghetti and Meatballs</mark>. i just wouldn't recommend ordering the asparagus and hopefully the music is not as loud next visit.\n\nyelp 2014 365 review challenge #23", 
            "tasty <mark>Classic Meatballs</mark>, and...\n\n5-stars for the chicago cracker thin pizza. this is the only pizza to get here imo! i've had it twice now over the course of 3 separate visits. \n\ngetting the chicago cracker thin '<mark>Old Chicago</mark>' style means it comes with: <mark><mark>Tomato Sauce</mark></mark>, mozzarella, provolone, garlic, <mark>Extra Cheese, Pepperoni, or Italian Fennel Sausage</mark>, sliced meatballs, ricotta, romano and oregano. perfect! the cracker-thin crust is spot-on and just like my favorite hole-in-the-wall pizza joint near midway airport in chicago. it comes out perfectly toasty and savory, and cut into squares as it should be. you will not feel stuffed, just satisfied.\n\nif you're up in the air as to which style pizza to get because there are so many to choose from, you gotta pick the chicago cracker thin pizza. walking through the restaurant on the way to the men's restroom and back, i wish everyone had a chicago cracker thin pizza on their pizza racks instead of the more traditional pies they chose. from the looks of it, the average person likes bready pizza with pepperoni on it. or at least that's what they think they like.\n\nchicago cracker thin. the only way i rock pizza rock.",

            "this is the first restaurant i have ever been to that serves every style of pizza. \n\nafter walking in, we were barely greeted by the two girls chatting at the hostess stand. i asked to see a menu and was given a dirty one, i handed it back to her and asked for a clean one. she looked at me as if she had something to say then said alright let me look. the second menu she handed me was satisfactory.\n\nafter sitting down it took about 15 min for our waitress to come over. as soon as she comes over i ordered the <mark>Gorgonzola & Apple</mark> salad, and the <mark>Honey Pie</mark>. the salad was very mediocre; the pizza was tasty but had a few flaws. the main flaw being the fried onion strings on top of the pizza. they were unnecessary, made the pizza greasier, and took away from the other great ingredients. fried onions have no place on a pizza!", 
            "cannot say enough good things about this place!  we are in dt vegas 3 to 4 times a year and always make a few stops at pizza rock.  my husband loves the gluten free pizza.  we always make sure to do the acoustic brunch for the $10 bottomless mimosas.  when traveling with our 9 yr old we have done the kids in the kitchen and it was wonderful!  other favorites are the <mark>Fried Green Beans</mark>, garlic bread, margarita pizza and the <mark>Gorgonzola & Apple</mark> salad.  great beer selection, wish they had more gf beer or ciders to pick from.", 
            "we were in downtown and wanted to try a new restaurant. i am so happy we found this on yelp! even though it is not on fremont, it is only a quick walk from it. and quite frankly it's worth it since sadly a lot of the food options on fremont is well... not so good.\n\nwe showed up on a saturday evening and was seated shortly afterwards. the decor of this place is a feast for your eyes. i loved the cute pee-pee sign for the restroom! we were seated right next to a semi truck! there were lots of tvs for your viewing pleasure. love the fact that on some of the tvs there were closed captioning. (i would like to know what's happening instead of watching a silent film, well in this case game.)\n\nour server, tim c., was excellent! (he is part of the reason why this place is a 5 star!) we let him know that it was our first time there. he was very thorough in explaining on what was popular. during our meal he came back often to make sure our food was to our satisfaction and if we needed another beer.\n\nas for the food, since we had pizza the night before we decided to have a non-pizza meal. (i know, who goes to a pizza join and not get pizza right?!) i ordered the gorgonzola & apple salad. this hit the spot! love the combination of the gorgonzola and apple with cranberries and walnuts. it was not heavy at all and it was very satisfying. i had a bite of my husband's <mark>Gorgonzola Burger</mark>. it was delicious! the patty was very juicy. and omg can i say their fries that come with it is amazing! they use real garlic and they use a lot of it! really puts some hair on your chest. definitely don't be kissing anyone after that. but definitely eat it!\n\nlooking forward to returning to this place and trying some of their pizzas!\n\nps. use your 15% off your bill with yelp check-in.", 
            "fabulous service and food! first experience and we will go back. the calamari calabrese was spicy and yummy. the new york pizza perfect. we also ordered a <mark>Gorgonzola Burger</mark> which we brought home and warms up perfect with scrumptious fries. ryan our server was very attentive and just really cool.\na must on your list. we will be back, but be hungry... large portions.", 
            "stopped here for lunch and absolutely enjoyed the pizzas! we ordered the <mark>Cal Italia</mark> as well as the <mark>Gluten Free Pancetta Gorgonzola</mark>. both pizzas were amazing, but the <mark>Cal Italia</mark> was an incredible change to the average pizza. the prosciutto drizzled with balsamic was unlike any other. sweet but had a nice twang and the greens were a nice addition.\nthe service and atmosphere were great.\n\ntip: a side of ranch is .50 extra."

            "i kept hearing about this tony guy and his award winning pizzas, i was excited to try a new pizzeria that was getting so much buzz. \n\ngoal was to try one pizza from each of the ovens.\n\nnapoletana - 900 degree wood stefano ferrara. we went with the margherita. this was pretty standard, nothing stood out, i felt it was served a bit cold as well, although michael made a good point, it couldn't been from the photo ops.\n\npizza romana - electric brick oven 700 degrees. we chose the romana iii. it's 3 pizzas in 1. 1/3 was gorgonzola, dates & pecans, <mark>Apples, Honey, Nutella</mark> (this was my favorite) 1/3 was <mark>Sweet Fig Preserves</mark>, prosciutto, gorgonzola, <mark>Balsamic Reduction</mark> (this was my second favorite) and the other portion was ricotta, garlic, basil, linguisa, <mark>Piquante Peppers</mark>. this was a nice option if you have lots of people in your party, you can a piece of each.\n\nclassic italian - gas brick oven 650 degrees. we chose the <mark>Cal Italia</mark>. this was the gold medal winner on the food network, and the winner for jaime w and i. i liked how all the ingredients came together.\n\ncalifornia - 900 degree wood fire oven. we chose the <mark>Quail Egg White Rose Potato Guanciale</mark>. this had a kick, spicy! this was my least favorite of the pizzas, not a fan of eggs on my pizza, but at least i can say i gave it a try. \n\nwe then sampled the <mark>Farmers Market</mark> pizza, weekly special using ingredients from downtown <mark>Farmers Market</mark>, this week it was pumpkin, brown sugar, cinnamon, bacon and topped with dollops of marshmallow. didn't really do anything for me. \n\ndessert, yes we still had room for dessert. <mark>Mud Pie</mark>, <mark>Pecan Turnover</mark> and desert calzone. nothing really excited me. it was all pretty standard. \n\noverall, i wasn't in love with this place. nothing was that spectacular that would make me drive to downtown and attempt to find parking. save this place for the tourists.", 
            "pizza overload!  so many different pies...different ovens...different toppings...no time for all that!\n\ncame with a group of yelpers with big appetites, so we were able to blast our way through quite a bit on the menu!\n\nmy favorite by far was the cal-italia ($18): asiago, mozzarella, imported gorgonzola, sweet fig preserve, prosciutto di parma, parmigiano-reggiano & <mark>Balsamic Reduction</mark>. this was excellent and the highlight of the meal for me! great mix of sweet, savory and vinegar/acidic flavors.  highly recommended :)\n\nanother great choice would be the margherita ($16): san marzano tomatoes, mozzarella fior di latte, basil, evoo and <mark>Sea Salt</mark>. honestly, this was probably the first enjoyable margheria i've had! not usually a fan of this style pie.  whatever they do differently here, i enjoyed...but you may not for the same reasons.\n\n<mark>Quail Egg White Rose Potato Guanciale</mark> ($18): mozzarella, white rose potatoes, chorizo, pork cheek, rosemary, fromage blanc, calabrese peppers & lavender <mark>Sea Salt</mark>. this was surprisingly spicy...a bit over the top, but still enjoyable.  order it knowing it's actually spicy, and you'll do just fine.\n\nromana iii ($32): 1) <mark>Sweet Fig Preserves</mark>, prosciutto, gorgonzola & <mark>Balsamic Reduction</mark>. 2) ricotta, garlic, basil, linguisa & <mark>Piquante Peppers</mark>. 3) gorgonzola, dates & pecans, and <mark>Apples, Honey, Nutella</mark>. interesting combinations here...the only one that didn't really satisfy was the middle portion. a bit spendy, but it's huge and serves 2-4 people.  i'd pass on this one next visit.\n\nfor dessert, we also tried quite a bit.  the best imo was the <mark>Pecan Turnover</mark> : light puff pastry, maple pecan, crunch & coffee ice cream. this was pretty tasty...probably the most enjoyable dessert we tried. came out piping hot too...yum :)\n\napple calzone : brown sugar, cinnamon, caramel & vanilla gelato. this is served with 2 calzones...pretty good overall but nothing extraordinary. \n\nmarket pizza : pumpkin puree, cinnamon, brown sugar, bacon & marshmallows. not really my kind of dessert...perhaps if you are a pumpkin lover?\n\n<mark>Mud Pie</mark> : oreo cookie crust, chocolate ganache, coffee vanilla bean ice cream, hot fudge, caramel & house made whipped cream. this was very frozen...hard as a rock. i enjoyed the cookie crust though. \n\nso it's a hit or miss kinda spot for me.  depending on what you order, your results will vary...for better and worse.\n\npics!"

            "hands down the best pizza in vegas- and it's probably not close. it breaks the mold of gangster inspired stuffy pizza joints (prevalent in vegas) where the godfather soundtrack plays on repeat all day and every pizza comes with 35lbs of cheese on it. \n\ni had not been to pizza rock before last night. i had been to tony's in sf (another location with the same owner) so i knew how good it was going to be but somehow just never got around to it- shameful i know. it is located downtown just outside of the ruckus. it is across the street from the grand hotel and casino and you can valet park there to attend the restaurant.\n\nwe made a reservation but it didn't look like it was necessary for a sunday night. as we were being lead to our table it took every bit of restraint i could muster to not snatch slices off the many delicious looking pizzas we walked by. the decor is very orange county chopper-esque and the music is a lot of rock from the 90's which is good for the newly over 30 and old crowd. also when i checked in on yelp i got a 15% of coupon so make sure you do that. \n\nthe food\n\nwe got two pizzas since we couldn't decide. we had gotten <mark>The Butcher 'All Meat'</mark> appetizer in sf and it was great but we decided to skip it and try for dessert. \n\n<mark>Cal Italia</mark>- this was the pizza we had in sf and it has haunted us ever since. it is a white style pizza with prosciutto and <mark>Sweet Fig Preserves</mark>, sprinkled with balsamic vinegar. it sounds pretty weird i know but it is insanely good.  the pizza rock version did not disappoint. \n\n<mark>The Ogden</mark>- this had olive, <mark>Goat Cheese</mark>, <mark>House Made Honey and Calabrese Sausage</mark> on a white pizza. i know what you are thinking \"two white pizzas?\"- and yes we went there. this was not quite as good as the <mark>Cal Italia</mark>- but still good. it could of been improved by adding some more <mark>Goat Cheese</mark>- some of the pieces had quite a bit, others almost none.\n\nchicken parm- i didn't get this unfortunately- someone at the table next to me did. it looked so good i strongly considered cracking his skull open like a coconut and taking it before going on the lamb. \n\nthey have so many other unique flavors of pizza i will definitely be going back in order to try as many as possible. \n\n<mark>Mud Pie</mark>- i saw someone else get this dessert and had to get it. it comes with some awesome flavored whip cream (grand marnier?) that is sort of orange tasting- highly recommend.", 
            "been here about two times already and i really love their pizzas. <mark>The Ogden</mark> was pretty good, not too heavy on sauce and meat. also, the linguini with clams was really tasty. the clams were so huge! very good for parties as well.", 
            "i was pretty shocked by our experience here this past weekend... i mean, this place is almost at 5 stars after 600 reviews! you would think even on an off night they're pretty amazing. but alas, it was very disappointing and if i go back, i would only do it on a relatively quiet weekday night.\n\nwe were there for a friends 30th birthday, and the group was about 15 people. there were a few other groups larger than us, and perhaps that was the reason that things were so chaotic. our server was stressed and unfriendly, but hey...i've been there. i know it's terrible to be stretched so thin you can't even breathe, but at some point the disorganization got pretty comical.\n\ndrinks and food were brought out randomly with people yelling out what it was and people having to raise their hand. this was funny because it was a long table, and it was loud in there, and i happen to be sitting on the end where the servers were coming from. seemingly none of the servers knew where anything was going. all night, from drinks to extra silverware to pizza, people would just come out and yell something... and more than likely not get a quick response because nobody could hear them. a bunch of times it wasn't even supposed to be for our table. so service, not great.\n\nbut all bad service can be redeemed by good food. like i said, i know what it's like to be swamped as a server, so unless you're a complete bitch, then whatever. we're here for the food. however, we got \"<mark>The Ogden</mark>\" pizza, and it was just plain bad. it seemed undercooked, and the flavors just didn't come together at all. perhaps it was rushed, but it wasn't crispy at all and it was rather oily. unfortunately, the birthday girl and many others felt the same about their pizzas...it was just alright.\n\nthe prices weren't the worst, but they weren't cheap either. because of the reviews and the higher than normal prices, i guess i expected too much. even so, restaurants with this high of a rating still manage to blow me away, so i don't know what happened last night. go back on a weekend night? never. \n\ni may try it again for lunch or something, but i just didn't even get a glimpse of what the fuss was about.",

            "this post is overdue, but then again, when am i not behind? a couple weeks ago, we went downtown to try pizza rock. it's owned by tony gemignani you might know him from bar rescue. we also know of him because of his restaurant is san francisco, tonys pizza napoletana. upon returning from our recent trip, i checked to see how the menus compare... they're practically identical. that meant those delicious meatballs could be had right here at home. we only hoped they were just as good. \n\nmy brother joined us and we got there in time for happy hour (mon-fri 3-6; sun-thur 10-close). beers, appetizers and pizzas are discounted (local's discount does not apply). they have a great craft beer selection ($5) so they hooked me on that alone. we each ordered meatballs ($3). <mark>The Butcher 'All Meat'</mark> itself was just as good as those in san francisco, but the sauce was too acidic. hopefully, the kitchen is still tweaking the recipe. still, we enjoyed them. we shared an order of garlic bread ($5). very <mark>Garlic</mark>, but otherwise unmemorable. \n\nwe each ordered a personal pizza from the happy hour menu. this was a great savings and a way to try pizzas we typically wouldn't order. <mark>Frank's True Italian (Thin Crust)</mark> ($7) had pesto garlic and it was topped with mozzarella and <mark><mark>Cherry Tomato</mark></mark>. this was our favorite of the three. \n \nthe pepperoni had some kick ($5) but it was the least liked crust and <mark>Cal Italia</mark> ($7) was too sweet for my liking; it seemed like dessert. however, it came highly recommended from our server and it has won awards. it has sweet fig preserve and topped with mozzarella, gorgonzola, and prosciutto. \n\npizzas i've had at tony's have been far more impressive so next time i'll stick to the regular menu for pizza, but i'll definitely enjoy those $3 meatballs and $5 craft beers again.", 
            "the service was awesome. the pizza was awesome. the ambience was awesome. zero complaints and some of the best pizza i've had in vegas. try the <mark>Frank's True Italian (Thin Crust)</mark>. you will not regret.", 
            "so i read an article about pizza rock, in one of the magazines that is in the seat back pocket on the airplane. the article made it sound pretty good so we read some reviews on yelp and decided to give it a try. this place, pardon the pun, rocks!\n\nfirst off, the location is only one block off of freemont street, on third street, an easy walk from all of the freemont street action.\n\nthe place has a really cool grunge, rock bar feel, yet it is appropriate for all ages. our 11 year old and 19 year old both really liked the place, especially the good music/video mix they have playing.\n\nwe visited pizza rock twice while we were in vegas. visit #1 was so good, we had to go back for more a few days later.\n\nvisit #1 - i can't remember the server's name, but she was awesome. her recommendations were spot on and our drinks were always full. we ordered the <mark>Cal Italia</mark> pizza which is a sauceless pizza with asiago, mozzarella, gorgonzola, fig preserve, prosciutto, and <mark>Balsamic Reduction</mark>. it was amazing. one of the best pizzas we've ever had. my 11 year old had the margherita and it was very similar to the margherita pizzas you find in rome. we finished lunch with a tiramisu and it was extraordinary! the best i have ever had!\n\nvisit #2 - the second time we came to the restaurant was a saturday around 10 pm and it was significantly busier than our visit a few days earlier, at lunch. this time we had the <mark>New Yorker</mark>, which was good, but it did have too much garlic and the ricotta gave the pizza an odd taste. if you are a garlic and ricotta fan, you will like it, me not so much. we also ordered <mark>Frank's True Italian (Thin Crust)</mark>, which is a pesto pizza similar to the style you find at grimaldi's, it was very good.\n\nlong story short, this place is a top notch pizza joint and it deserves all of the awards it has won. my favorite pizza place in nevada, bar none.",

            "i've now been to pizza rock twice. first things first, why not 5 stars? basically because i've been here twice and i have never been told that locals receive 20% off their bill. what the heck pizza rock? i don't typically go around asking, hey can i get a local discount? but. when i've been here twice and sung its praises to people - and yet, i've been able to get 20% off but haven't? arg. that ruffles my feathers.\n\non to what is good. happy hour is awesome. personal pizzas, apps, well drinks, and cocktails all on the cheap. my friends and i came here during hh and split all three of the personal pizzas and shared <mark>The Butcher 'All Meat'</mark>. okay. i'm no meatball expert but i think these are delicious. meaty, not bready, and the sauce it comes with compliments very well. i also like that these meatballs are simple. i've had way too many meatballs that have way too much going on with them. another reason i like them: you can cut them down the middle with your fork and they fall away in two pieces, not a bunch of lumpy, gross meat pieces. quality. i think.\n\nother than hh.... i came here with my hubby on a saturday night. luckily they have plenty of 2-top tables so we were seated quickly. service was quick and to the point. our server neither impressed me or upset me so i'll give a neutral rating for service.\n\nwhat we ordered... the <mark>New Yorker</mark> 23. it was the one pizza on the menu i figured my picky (and rather plain-jane) husband would enjoy. the <mark>New Yorker</mark> comes with: sliced mozzarella, <mark><mark>Tomato Sauce</mark></mark>, sliced house link sausage, garlic, pepperoni, ricotta. i asked for the link sausages to be removed and replaced with mushrooms. they were happy to oblige. under the menu it says, \"winner, best traditional, las vegas\". i'm not sure what that means.\n\noverall thoughts on the pizza... i enjoyed it. i love the thin crust style. the mix of cheese and sauce was perfect. pepperoni... okay. the ricotta cheese was an awesome addition, creamy and slightly sweet offsetting the heartiness of the pepperoni <mark>Clam and Garlic</mark>. the flavors were that of a \"normal\" pizza, but with a refinement. i think this was a perfect way to satisfy my more adventurous side and my husband's more traditional side.\n\nfinal decision: mine and my husband's dinner was a bit pricey. although delicious, i would rather go back for the happy hour. hh is your best bet here. and ya, go ahead and throw in the fact you're a local. you'll probably get a discount, unlike me. i'd also be interested in just heading up to the take out window to take a slice to go.\n\nother things i want to go back for:\n\ntheir margherita (only 73 made per day)\n<mark>Clam and Garlic</mark> pizza\n<mark>La Regina</mark> (the gold cup winner)\n<mark>Quail Egg White Rose Potato Guanciale</mark> pizza\n<mark>Cal Italia</mark> (again, this comes as one of the personal pizzas on hh menu and is a foodnetwork winner)\nthe chorizo mussels (app)\nand i would come back again for <mark>The Butcher 'All Meat'</mark>.\n\nlooks, like i'll be making a few return trips. the great thing is, i am so happy there is a good, inventive pizza place so close to where i live now.", 
            "ok, i've eaten her about a dozen times since my first visit, and i'm still a fan. some of my favs that i'd like to recommend are <mark>The Butcher 'All Meat'</mark>, which i guess is made in house, not shipped frozen. the <mark>Cal Italia</mark> pizza which they won a food network award for. and the <mark>Burrata Burger</mark>. you've gotta try these!", 
            "this post is overdue, but then again, when am i not behind? a couple weeks ago, we went downtown to try pizza rock. it's owned by tony gemignani you might know him from bar rescue. we also know of him because of his restaurant is san francisco, tonys pizza napoletana. upon returning from our recent trip, i checked to see how the menus compare... they're practically identical. that meant those delicious meatballs could be had right here at home. we only hoped they were just as good. \n\nmy brother joined us and we got there in time for happy hour (mon-fri 3-6; sun-thur 10-close). beers, appetizers and pizzas are discounted (local's discount does not apply). they have a great craft beer selection ($5) so they hooked me on that alone. we each ordered meatballs ($3). <mark>The Butcher 'All Meat'</mark> itself was just as good as those in san francisco, but the sauce was too acidic. hopefully, the kitchen is still tweaking the recipe. still, we enjoyed them. we shared an order of garlic bread ($5). very <mark>Garlic</mark>, but otherwise unmemorable. \n\nwe each ordered a personal pizza from the happy hour menu. this was a great savings and a way to try pizzas we typically wouldn't order. <mark>Frank's True Italian (Thin Crust)</mark> ($7) had pesto garlic and it was topped with mozzarella and <mark><mark>Cherry Tomato</mark></mark>. this was our favorite of the three. \n \nthe pepperoni had some kick ($5) but it was the least liked crust and <mark>Cal Italia</mark> ($7) was too sweet for my liking; it seemed like dessert. however, it came highly recommended from our server and it has won awards. it has sweet fig preserve and topped with mozzarella, gorgonzola, and prosciutto. \n\npizzas i've had at tony's have been far more impressive so next time i'll stick to the regular menu for pizza, but i'll definitely enjoy those $3 meatballs and $5 craft beers again.", 
            "four of us tried this place last night.  immediately like the feel and the d\\u00e9cor.  love it when restaurants get it right and have plenty of both high tops and low tops.  \n\nryan, our server was great!  <mark>The Butcher 'All Meat'</mark> and sauce were a big 5!  we all loved the sauce at it was not sweet at all...we all really dislike most restaurants that put sugar in their sauce.\n\nthe pizza and menu were just between a 3-4 as i think the many choices of pizza is just too overwhelming.  i like to be able to order the best thing for me every time we go out (don't we all) and if i would have asked all the questions i needed to in order to understand which pizza would have been the best for me, i would have driven ryan mad!  we tried two types which as i said were just a 3-4 and sorry i can't remember which ones they were unless i look at the menu, but we will be back and hopefully i will choose better for my liking next time.", 
            "this place is absolutely amazing!!!! from the minute we walked in we were greeted by two very friendly girls. we even had a small dance party with them making our 10 min wait fly by with fun. never have i been treated this way by any restaurant, you guys are doing it right with those two up there.  they were exactly right, waiting on a perfect big booth to accommodate our party of 8.  the place smells amazing the minute you hit the door.  after being seated we were immediately greeted by our server kathleen .  i will definitely request her every return. drinks came out fast, our order was perfect, & she also seemed like a real person(not a scripted robot). i don't know how people on here have complained about <mark>The Butcher 'All Meat'</mark>.. these things are bomb!!! definitely a must try & especially for the price!! we ordered a few different pizzas. new york 22\" was so delicious and plenty to feed most of us.  we also tried the <mark>Cal Italia</mark>. my favorite pizza by far!!! if i was with only a couple friends this would be our #1 choice, just wish the size was larger. also tried the romana ii. omg 3 delicious pizzas all in one! great choice if you are very indecisive like me!! overall i loved this place! excellent atmosphere for the younger crowd! i'm already planning my next bday party! while i was there they were also accommodating two massive parties and still making room for the rest of us! five stars hands down! everything from the front of the house to the back! pizza rock...you guys rock!!!!", 
            "update to my last review. gave pizza rock a second try last night. ordered a large pepperoni pizza and appetizer of 3 meatballs to go. order was ready when we arrived and the to go guy was really friendly and easy going. he flashed us our pie prior to us leaving with it to verify it was our order (always better than leaving with someone else's order). \nover the phone my official order was a <mark>Tomato Pie</mark> add pepperoni. i thought this just included pepp and mozz cheese but our pie had the dollops of ricotta that ruined our pie due to their icy temp the last time. kinda bummed but they were actually way better this time. we pretty much downed half the pie on the car ride home :) <mark>The Butcher 'All Meat'</mark> were amazing however. next time i'm getting a large order. i don't even like meatballs or loaves or any shaped meat really. but these were awesome! thumbs up pizza rock! we will be back.", 
            "wow, really? in the middle of vegas? i find a restaurant that serves a true neapolitan pizza? i am truly amazed. \n\ni'm here visiting vegas with my 19 month old while my husband is here training so i did a yelp search to find somewhere to have lunch. when i saw this place pop up on my search i initially wrote it off because i haven't had many good experiences with neapolitan pizzas in the us (of all the states i've visited, portland surprisingly had the most delicious italian style pizzas). anyway going back to my yelp search, i saw that the owner/chef here won a pizza award in naples (side note: my husband's father is from naples, so we visit the city often) so i knew i had to try this.\n\ni ordered a <mark>House Salad</mark> (which the waitress told me was half a caesar salad), meat balls and the neapolitan margherita pizza with bufala mozzarella. they were all delicious!! <mark>The Butcher 'All Meat'</mark> were devoured by my 19 months old son. i thought they were beautifully made and the marinara sauce was just perfect. the pizza dough was just the way i like it and should be, soft and chewy with a bit of char to it. mmmmmm i dipped the leftover crust in <mark>The Butcher 'All Meat'</mark> sauce, genius! ahaha\n\ni was pleasantly surprised, and at the same time amazed that anyone here in vegas could really appreciate this food. no offence. but americans (i'm a brit/japanese) prefer american style pizzas. i'm sure that's why this place offers different styles of pizza from cali to ny pizzas. i'm not a fan of those so i didn't try them. but i've no doubt that everything on the menu is delicious here. \n\ni hope pizza rock expand into los angeles so i can eat this every week! i saw that sls hotel is going to house 800 degree pizza from spring 2014 so seems like there'll be some competition starting next year.", 
            "you have no idea how much i hate the food in downtown las vegas. le thai is meh, and don't even get me started on spots like park on fremont or la comida.\n\nthis spot gave me some hope in humanity. actually, it knocked my socks off.\n\nlast week, i met up with some friends for a chill happy hour and my friend suggested this spot. i was hesitant at first, but i'm down for an adventure.\n\nhere's the breakdown:\n\ndrinks\n-- awesome happy hour. ends at 6pm m-f.  my massive beers were $5.50. clean beer lines, no skunkiness. absolutely perfect.\n--$3 well drinks\n\nfood\n-- amazing! get <mark>The Butcher 'All Meat'</mark>. $3 for 3. they are swimming in marinara which was also fantastic. i don't usually care for marinara, so this stood out.\n-- pizza: you must get the <mark>Cal Italia</mark>! fig preserve, prosciutto, asiago etc. amazing.\n\nambiance\n--perfect. great for groups, small and large. music is fun and the tv's are massive. i'd definitely come back to watch a game here.\n\nservice\n--very accomodating. our server was awesome and attentive without being annoying.\n\ni cannot wait to come back!!!", 
            "ok- my biggest problem was that i had at my disposal either yelp check in coupon  for 15% off and the 15% off one handed out at the nearby hotel i was saying at (downtown grand) but what sucked was neither is accepted at happy hour which is why i went to this establishment- i think both the coupon here at yelp or  the hotel should have stated it. my meal ran about $16 so i would of saved a bit to tip more...just saying\n\nthat said, it was super slow when i arrived. servers were cut but mine was a nice rocker girl. she got busy after a bit but still was attentive. i got <mark>The Butcher 'All Meat'</mark>, calamari and personal pizza ( the meat one). meats and calamari were great, pizza was ok and a good size. i took half of it back to my room for snacking later. \n\nthe place works for happy hot adjacent to the hotel and area of downtown3rd.",

            "as i entered the cavernous pizza rock space in the newly gentrified downtown, i think that the decor reminds me of those doctors who wear biker chaps on the weekend and ride harleys.  i think the place feels like business people have money to try and look cool but not quite getting there.  \n\nwho care?  pies are good.  you gotta be impressed with the amount of money that went into buying all those ovens.  most pizza joints boasts only one.  the variety on the menu is impressive and some choices are inventive.  i especailly liked the farmer's market special.  i mean they are within walking distance of the third street friday market, they should take advantage of it and make a pizza out of what is fresh that day.  \n\nthe pizzas are huge and tasty.\n\nthe clams that we got were huge and tasty.\n\ni can see people hosting parties there.  there is plenty of space and pizza is good grub to feed a lot of people.\n\nthere's also a takeout counter.  i think they serve folks at the downtown grand too.  \n\nget there during happy hour.  get <mark>The Butcher 'All Meat'</mark> for cheap.  :)\n\nwhat is the best thing about the place is that the people working there are receptive to reviews, right then and there.  they really want to know what you think.  that is always a plus for me.",

            "hands down the best pizza in vegas- and it's probably not close. it breaks the mold of gangster inspired stuffy pizza joints (prevalent in vegas) where the godfather soundtrack plays on repeat all day and every pizza comes with 35lbs of cheese on it. \n\ni had not been to pizza rock before last night. i had been to tony's in sf (another location with the same owner) so i knew how good it was going to be but somehow just never got around to it- shameful i know. it is located downtown just outside of the ruckus. it is across the street from the grand hotel and casino and you can valet park there to attend the restaurant.\n\nwe made a reservation but it didn't look like it was necessary for a sunday night. as we were being lead to our table it took every bit of restraint i could muster to not snatch slices off the many delicious looking pizzas we walked by. the decor is very orange county chopper-esque and the music is a lot of rock from the 90's which is good for the newly over 30 and old crowd. also when i checked in on yelp i got a 15% of coupon so make sure you do that. \n\nthe food\n\nwe got two pizzas since we couldn't decide. we had gotten <mark>The Butcher 'All Meat'</mark> appetizer in sf and it was great but we decided to skip it and try for dessert. \n\n<mark>Cal Italia</mark>- this was the pizza we had in sf and it has haunted us ever since. it is a white style pizza with prosciutto and <mark>Sweet Fig Preserves</mark>, sprinkled with balsamic vinegar. it sounds pretty weird i know but it is insanely good.  the pizza rock version did not disappoint. \n\n<mark>The Ogden</mark>- this had olive, <mark>Goat Cheese</mark>, <mark>House Made Honey and Calabrese Sausage</mark> on a white pizza. i know what you are thinking \"two white pizzas?\"- and yes we went there. this was not quite as good as the <mark>Cal Italia</mark>- but still good. it could of been improved by adding some more <mark>Goat Cheese</mark>- some of the pieces had quite a bit, others almost none.\n\nchicken parm- i didn't get this unfortunately- someone at the table next to me did. it looked so good i strongly considered cracking his skull open like a coconut and taking it before going on the lamb. \n\nthey have so many other unique flavors of pizza i will definitely be going back in order to try as many as possible. \n\n<mark>Mud Pie</mark>- i saw someone else get this dessert and had to get it. it comes with some awesome flavored whip cream (grand marnier?) that is sort of orange tasting- highly recommend.",

            "this is now my second run-in with pizza made (or rather associated with) tony gemignani. he's well known in san francisco for being a world pizza champion and owner of tony's pizza napoletana. my first experience consisted of a long wait, which was all i could recall. i guess the pizza was less than memorable. \n\na local b-list celebrity chef opening a spruced up rock-themed pizza joint in vegas? why do i have a feeling this is a setup for failure. it's just a feeling. first, the good. i like the concept of offering different styles of pizza made from different oven types. they are very temperature specific ranging from the hottest wood-fired oven, an electric brick oven, and down to a gas brick oven. the <mark>Cal Italia</mark>, made from the latter oven was a winner for me. it was also crowned the winner of the food network pizza champions challenge. the crust was perfect - lightly crispy on top with a mostly chewy consistency. the sweet fig preserve and <mark>Balsamic Reduction</mark> paired with the prosciutto and parmigiano-reggiano was a home run. \n\nthe bad. the menu is way too large. i tried the <mark>Burrata Burger</mark>, which was awfully salty with the bacon mixed into the patty. i could barely taste any of the burrata due to the over seasoning. <mark>The Butcher 'All Meat'</mark> and truffle fries were average.\n\nthe ugly. the margherita, the supposed world pizza cup winner, was burnt to the point where we had to ask the waitress to return it. i know my pizza and the occasional blistering of the crust, but this was beyond that. it was black all around as well as burnt black flour underneath. all i could taste was the bitterness of the charred crust and of regret. a wood fire pizza cannot sit in a 900 degree oven very long. the saving grace was a very apologetic and helpful waitress. \n\ni like the large space and the fact that there's a big rig in the middle of the restaurant, but the atmosphere cannot entice me to return. for a city that prides itself on offering free parking in most places, the downtown parking situation was abysmal. street parking was minimal and most of the offerings around pizza rock were at one of the local hotels that offered valet (free only with validation). oh, i also happened to use the restroom before leaving and witnessed a guy vomiting and retching profusely in the stall next to me. to be fair, i cannot say if it was from the food or the alcohol. let's just leave it at that.", 
            "we come for <mark>The Butcher 'All Meat'</mark>!! delicious, the sauce is fantastic!  the selection of beers on tap is great & pretty cheap during happy hour. hh is 3-6p m-f & 10-closing daily...awesome!!", 
            "i've had the pleasure of dining at pizza rock quite a few times and for the most part they are pretty good. they are a bit on the pricey side and service can be spotty, but the food is always on point and delivered hot and fresh to your table. the interior is pretty cool, it is large and open, there is even a semi-truck on the inside!\n\ni'm a big fan of the <mark>Old Chicago</mark> pizza, <mark>The Butcher 'All Meat'</mark> are delicious and the fresh ricotta is creamy and melts in your mouth. the cal-italia is an interesting choice if you are in the mood for something a bit sweet. all of the ingredients work really well together, despite sounding a bit odd. i've also tried the <mark>Burrata Burger</mark> and while it was a good burger i think that burrata is too delicate to melt on a burger. it's a cheese that you need to eat alone to really appreciate the flavor. i've also had their <mark>Meatball Sub</mark> and while i wasn't a huge fan of the bun, <mark>The Butcher 'All Meat'</mark> were flavorful and delicious. the rosemary and <mark>Sea Salt</mark> garlic fries are a pretty good side as well.\n\nthey also have a counter right inside the door where you can grab a quick slice. i've spent many lunch breaks perched at the counter with a slice. again, it's a bit pricey, but the slices are huge and you can try a variety of toppings. \n\ni think that pizza rock is a great addition to downtown. it's great for big groups and it's nice to have an artisan pizza restaurant within walking distance from work.",

            "a must have: get <mark>The Butcher 'All Meat'</mark>. everything about it is delicious!!!! tried the <mark>New Yorker</mark> was pretty good. big slices. i will be back to try other pizzas!", 
            "love this place!! the pizza slices are amazing & nicely sized! <mark>The Butcher 'All Meat'</mark> & string beans are also really tasty, will probably come back here every time i visit vegas!!", 
            "my wife and i tried this place out because she used to work at the district... they have a pretty decent happy hour, we got a lot of food for the price! pretty decent food, the fig pizza was delectable, <mark>The Butcher 'All Meat'</mark> were ok, and the beer selection was pretty great!", 
            "fell in love with the asparagus w little quail egg on it ! we also had <mark>The Butcher 'All Meat'</mark> & calamari, all super good. eric was our server & he was amazing! he had us laughing & had great recommendations ! will totally be coming back for more", 
            "a couple years ago, i thought it would be a good idea to have a restaurant that specializes in serving several distinctly different types of pizza as a sort of homage to the great pizzas from around the world. well this place beat me to it and did it better than i ever could.\n\nthe concept is solid. the execution is, well impressive. only drawback is that the sheer variety of doughs they have to make forces them to limit several of the pies to a daily maximum. on one occasion they were already out of the pizza we wanted. still, our second choice was quite good so no harm, no foul.\n\nhappy hour food specials are very reasonable and quite good. <mark>The Butcher 'All Meat'</mark>, although simple, are excellent.\n\nslice bar up front serves only the new york-style slice, which is definitely not the strength of this place, but if you are in a rush i think the picante slice is a creative change of pace from traditional flavors and is definitely worth a try.\n\na german hefeweizen would go great with the spicy notes found throughout the menu, unfortunately there is none to be found here.", 
            "when my family told me about pizza rock, i had no idea that i was in for a real treat!  <mark>The Butcher 'All Meat'</mark> appetizer was wonderful!  the marinara sauce is unbelievable!  that is a staple on our items to share, along with the <mark>New Yorker</mark> pizza.  on another note, i must mention that we  dined there the other day for lunch.  our server, jj, was not good at all.  my brother ordered a salad without croutons, (croutons in salad); asked for a glass with my beer (different server, no glass), and ordered the mostaccioli with the marinara sauce, only.  we mentioned that we cannot have <mark>White Cream Sauce</mark> since we have disgestion issues.  when this dish arrived, it came with melted cheese on top, along with a spicy <mark>White Cream Sauce</mark>.  in essence, jj did not hear a word we said in our initial order and acted like he couldn't be bothered.  we had to flagged him down for any of our needs.  we were very disappointed with him.", 
            "world pizza cup winner!\n\nservice was quick and friendly. parking is limited to hotel structures.\n\nyelp offers 15% off!\n\nmargherita pizza - $17 - they only make 73 a day. this won the world pizza cup winner in italy. one of the freshest pizzas i have had. the sauce was so clean. dough was a bit soggy and limp. i wish it was a little more crispy. \n\nmeatballs - 3 for $5 - good decent sized meatballs. not dry and seasoned well. great to eat with <mark>The Butcher 'All Meat'</mark> pizza and the sauce was awesome to mop up the crust."

            "today is day one of the week long grand opening for pizza rock!  so excited to hear another new establishment has moved downtown!  what's even better was i heard they were showcasing their menu for the public and fine tune the overall experience for the actual opening on saturday.  originally, we heard you needed reservations to eat there for free this week, however, a coworker mentioned to us that folks working downtown will be able to roll in without reservations and be seated for dinner.  this was a perfect opportunity for a couple of us to have a nice dinner after a hard day's work!\n\nthe restaurant is on the corner of ogden and 3rd st, attached to the mob bar and triple george saloon.  right away, you notice the huge \"pizza rock\" sign from the outside, bordered by flame artwork.  when you enter, there's a nice seating area with a very friendly hostess station.  everyone was super excited to greet you and take your name.  because of the grand opening, we were able to walk around the restaurant and take a look at the decor.  to the right of the hostess stand was the pizza takeout window with a viewable kitchen.  pretty cool.  after the seating area, the main focal point of the restaurant is the life sized semi truck in the middle of the dining area.  super cool!  it serves as a multi purpose art.  aside from the obvious attention grabber, it's the new dj station and serves to break up the bar area and dining area.  wow! the bar is huge and gorgeous!  lots of metal art accents around it.  lots of exposed brick around the restaurant.  they even have little private coves for seating in the dining area if you want to entertain that romantic date or have an intimate family dinner.  lots going on and it all seems to work.  \n\nwhen we were greeted by our server, shirley, we were informed of a couple of things:  they didn't have pasta, they didn't have bread, they didn't have sausage and they didn't have steak.  kind of bummed about it but everything else was free so i couldn't really complain.  shirley was a bit flustered as i expected on day one.  she quoted the wrong price for wine, ordered our food at different times which resulted in a lot of waiting and found herself making multiple trips to the table, because of the lack of efficiency.  i completely understand.  first day jitters are a given.  she had a great personality and that ended up going a long way in my book.\n\nfor dinner, here's what we got:\n\n<mark>Classic Caesar</mark>, normally for $10.00:  hearts of romaine, homemade caesar dressing, house croutons and shaved pieces of parmigiano-reggiano.  definitely a shareable dish.  i think this could comfortable feed 3 people as their first course.  lots of fresh ingredients, but i didn't have a few issues with this salad.  the croutons were way too toasted and very crunchy.  the dressing, as being the star of the dish was way too tangy.  they made it with a lot of anchovies.  now i'm a huge fan of homemade caesar dressing but this was way too overpowered with anchovies.\n\nmargherita pizza, normally for $15.00:  this pizza was a 2007 world pizza cup winner in italy!  hand mixed dough using imported flour and proofed in wood boxed imported from italy.  wow.  san marzano tomatoes, mozzarella cheese, basil, extra virgin olive oil and <mark>Sea Salt</mark>.  the dough from the crust was amazing but the crust turned out a little burnt and had a slightly bitter taste.  the sauce was one of the stars of the show, nice and creamy.  mozzarella was flavorful and there were a lot for a margherita, which was awesome.  the only critique was the basil.  not enough to taste that element which makes a great pie. \n\ndowntown pizza, normally for $19.00:  wow, lots going on!  mozzarella, pepperoni, salami, bacon, chives, mushrooms, read onions, bell peppers, olives, <mark><mark>Extra Cheese, Pepperoni, or Italian Fennel Sausage</mark></mark> and <mark><mark>Cherry Tomato</mark></mark>.  think of it as an upgraded supreme.  with all these ingredients, there was no lack of flavor!  wow loved the flavor punch.  my only feedback was the crust was too thin for this pizza.  it couldn't support the amount of toppings.  it became soggy real fast and we ended up losing a lot of the toppings on the table.  \n\nmanhattan calzone, normally for $12.00:  stuffed with meatballs, mozzarella, ricotta <mark>Clam and Garlic</mark>.  as my friend put it, you would pay 12 bucks f<mark>Classic Pepperoni or Cheese</mark> and bread.  lots of cheese.  omg, it was everywhere.  i personally don't think ricotta is needed.  maybe use a lot more meat to balance out the cheese.  holy cheese!  \n\nduring this week, all menu food items are free.  our entire bill was comped which was the best part of the evening.  please remember to tip your servers great!  this review, i've created, is to give the best and most valuable feedback, so this place thrives downtown.  just the ambiance alone will take them far.  i will certainly be back to try other items of the menu.  next time, i'm hitting the steak and pasta hard!", 
            "love this place, was excited to have some gluten free pizza tonight so i called to place a pick up order. the hostess transferred me to a gentleman who barley spoke english and was literally unable to take my order. he couldn't understand that i was trying to order 2 seperate pizzas and when i asked him about desserts he suggested garlic bread <mark>Classic Pepperoni or Cheese</mark> sticks. when i explained to him those were side dishes and i wanted deserts... he told me i was wrong.   i literally hung up in frustration after arguing with this guy for 5 minutes.  nothing at all against hispanics, my husband is hispanic... but why the fuck did the english speaking hostess transfer me to someone uncapable of holding a conversation in english?! fail pizza rock. fail.  you lost my business tonight.", 
            "i had heard of this place but am not typically going to drive all the way downtown to try a new pizza place but we happened to be downtown on a sat afternoon and drove by pizza rock and figured, why not give it a try.\nglad we did. when walking in, the loud music piped in and around the entrance did give it that touristy feel but once you get inside, you could be anywhere in the suburbs. downtown or not, it's very nice place...and much larger than i'd imagined. i thought it was just a place to grab a slice and go but it's got a nice menu of various pizza options, very nicely decorated inside, clean, comfortable and large! we had no issues with staff during our visit.\npizza was excellent. we had the 12 inch american <mark>Classic Pepperoni or Cheese</mark> and that was enough for 2 people easy. salad was fresh, not your basic iceberg lettuce either, but spinach and other greens.", 
            "a vey solid pizza joint in the heart of downtown vegas! pizza rock is just a block off of fremont, so when your done eating it's a easy access to your fremont experience. we tried three different pies ranging from the <mark>New Yorker</mark>, to a sicilian, and a <mark>Classic Pepperoni or Cheese</mark>. the <mark>New Yorker</mark> was classic thin with ricotta cheese <mark>House Made Honey and Calabrese Sausage</mark> <mark>Sausage and Peppers</mark>! the cheese was thin crust and maybe the winner of the night for just a solid, good, perfectly cooked pie! the sicilian was very good as well, with a good deep dish dough and miniature <mark>Pepperoni</mark>! you can get a large variety of pizza styles here ranging from chicago deep dish, to new york thin crust, and more creative gourmet styles! my one knock on this place is that it is way over priced! in vegas where there are a few great pizza joints, with vegas style prices, this place definitely hits the high mark with our three pies and sodas topping the $100 plateau! this southern gentleman enjoyed his meal, loved the decor of the restaurant, loved the proximity to fremont, but probably wouldn't come back due to the extreme prices! at the same time i certainly would encourage you to try it out as it is a tasty pie!"

            "i'm a huge fan of tony gemingani so it was only a matter of time, with me being a frequent visitor to vegas, that i would visit pizza rock over in downtown vegas. \n\nthe menu is virtually the same from tony's pizza napolitana in sf.  it includes his famous award winning margherita which is cooked in under 2 minutes along with his vast assortment of pizzas from ny style, romana, california style, and gluten-free.  and it also includes his famous meatballs and pasta dishes as well.  don't forget to check out his burgers too.\n\nsame menu, different setting and in this case, a very different setting where instead of the traditional italian restaurant look from tony's in sf, it's more of a heavy metal rock theme inside here which is quite fitting for vegas actually.  that being said, the pizza is really top notch.  and although i've been to tony's in sf a few times, there are still a lot of things on the menu that i still haven't tried.  my friends and i decided on their <mark>Cal Italia</mark> and the <mark>Honey Pie</mark>.\n\n<mark>Cal Italia</mark> -- http://bit.ly/1bgftsf\ngold medal winner - food network pizza champions challenge\nasiago, mozzarella, imported gorgonzola, sweet fig preserve, prosciutto di parma, \nparmigiano-reggiano, <mark>Balsamic Reduction</mark> \nalthough i've been to tony's three times, this is actually my first time trying his prize winning <mark>Cal Italia</mark>.  it's a very interesting pie in both looks and flavor.  very sweet and savory from the figs and balsamic and prosciutto.  i really dug this pie and would definitely order it again next time i come back to either here or at tony's in sf.\n\n<mark>Honey Pie</mark> -- http://bit.ly/1kbvpvu\nquail hollow farm honey, calabrese peppers, <mark>Green Onions</mark>, mozzarella, piave cheese, \nfried <mark><mark>Caramelized Onions</mark></mark>, serrano peppers\ni've had this pie before at tony's in sf and i ordered it again to share with my friends in vegas so they can try it for the first time.  it's a very unusual pie that has a very sweet and savory flavor with a little spicy kick to it.  if you've ever had a deep fried wonton at a chinese restaurant and dip it in sweet and sour sauce, that's probably the most similar taste that i can compare this pizza to.  although the caramelized fried onions were a little burned, it still tasted delicious.  but for some reason, i wasn't tasting the honey.\n\none honorable mention i recommend from is their <mark>Burrata Burger</mark>.  i didn't have this at pizza rock but i've had it at tony's in sf.  i think it's very underrated because it's almost always overshadowed by the pizzas and everything else.  you get a 1/2 lb burger with burrata cheese and crispy prosciutto and it comes with a generous pile of parmesan garlic fries  (http://bit.ly/1epxy9t). definitely worth trying out!  \n\ni think what i like best is that the wait time at pizza rock is considerably shorter than it's older bother in sf where the wait time for a table can be at the least close to 2 hours.  though that could change if good word of mouth goes around.  it looks like pizza rock is off to a great start and with its extensive menu and popularity growing, i can see it doing very well in downtown vegas.", 
            "their pizza is out of this world. that's all you need to know.\n\nmy first visit was during yelp helps week and it was a great setting to try this eatery since there were so many of us, which meant that we had the opportunity to try so many different pies (of course, that also meant we were stuffed!). that night, i tried eight of their pies, a couple appetizers, desserts, and a cocktail. everything was so good that i returned just four days later with my fiance and friend hally!\n\nduring my return visit, i had to order the margherita ($16) again. the dough is hand-mixed with san felice flour and proofed in neapolitan wood boxes, then it's topped with san marzano tomatoes, mozzarella, fior di latte, basil, evoo, and <mark>Sea Salt</mark>. finally, it's baked in a 900-degree wood stefano ferrara oven. it's limited to 73 pies daily (although i heard they've gotten no where near that amount yet) and it won the world pizza cup in naples, italy. true neopolitan pizza! \n\nthe three of us also shared the downtown ($19): pepperoni, molinari salami, bacon, chives, mushrooms, red onions, bell peppers, <mark>Black Olives</mark>, <mark><mark>Extra Cheese, Pepperoni, or Italian Fennel Sausage</mark></mark>, <mark><mark>Cherry Tomato</mark></mark>; which is one of their \"american originals\" pizzas that all feature <mark><mark>Tomato Sauce</mark></mark>, mozzarella, and a rustic medium crust, baked in a gas brick oven at 550 degrees. as well as the <mark>Honey Pie</mark> ($17): quail hollow farm honey, calabrese peppers, <mark>Green Onions</mark>, mozzarella, piave cheese, fried <mark><mark>Caramelized Onions</mark></mark>, serrano peppers; one of their \"california\" pizzas that use caputo flour and baked in a 900-degree wood fire oven. \n\nthe downtown reminded me of a \"supreme/deluxe\" pizza, but definitely better. i had tried the <mark>Honey Pie</mark> during the first visit and although it wasn't one of my favorites that evening, i came to appreciate its flavors the second time around. i also tried their <mark>Classic Caesar</mark> salad ($10) and it was tasty. for drinks, i tried the strawberry fields martini ($9.50): stoli strawberry, strawberry puree and a hint of mint and hally ordered the moscow mule ($12): stoli vodka, ginger beer, and fresh squeezed lemon juice. both really delicious cocktails. \n\nfrom both visits, my favorite pizzas are the margherita, <mark>Honey Pie</mark>, and <mark>New Yorker</mark> and i absolutely loved the sweet nothing cocktail, so good. i didn't care for the <mark>Calamari Fritti</mark>, rosemary garlic fries, or the mastunicola pizza. anyway, i could eat that margherita pizza every day. it's that good. i have to keep telling myself to not order it, just so i can try their other delicious concoctions (i have my eyes on the <mark>Pizza Campari</mark>, <mark>Clam and Garlic</mark>, and proscuitto e pomodorini). hands down, definitely my favorite pizza joint now (sorry grimaldi's). but seriously, award-winning pies, five different pizza ovens, quality ingredients - you're convinced right?\n\nparking is best on the surrounding streets like on casino center blvd (meters take credit cards, yay, but you can only pay hourly at $1/hour) or free valet at the downtown grand (super easy and close). oh, and don't forget your locals discount!! win.",

            "their pizza is out of this world. that's all you need to know.\n\nmy first visit was during yelp helps week and it was a great setting to try this eatery since there were so many of us, which meant that we had the opportunity to try so many different pies (of course, that also meant we were stuffed!). that night, i tried eight of their pies, a couple appetizers, desserts, and a cocktail. everything was so good that i returned just four days later with my fiance and friend hally!\n\nduring my return visit, i had to order the margherita ($16) again. the dough is hand-mixed with san felice flour and proofed in neapolitan wood boxes, then it's topped with san marzano tomatoes, mozzarella, fior di latte, basil, evoo, and <mark>Sea Salt</mark>. finally, it's baked in a 900-degree wood stefano ferrara oven. it's limited to 73 pies daily (although i heard they've gotten no where near that amount yet) and it won the world pizza cup in naples, italy. true neopolitan pizza! \n\nthe three of us also shared the downtown ($19): pepperoni, molinari salami, bacon, chives, mushrooms, red onions, bell peppers, <mark>Black Olives</mark>, <mark><mark>Extra Cheese, Pepperoni, or Italian Fennel Sausage</mark></mark>, <mark><mark>Cherry Tomato</mark></mark>; which is one of their \"american originals\" pizzas that all feature <mark><mark>Tomato Sauce</mark></mark>, mozzarella, and a rustic medium crust, baked in a gas brick oven at 550 degrees. as well as the <mark>Honey Pie</mark> ($17): quail hollow farm honey, calabrese peppers, <mark>Green Onions</mark>, mozzarella, piave cheese, fried <mark><mark>Caramelized Onions</mark></mark>, serrano peppers; one of their \"california\" pizzas that use caputo flour and baked in a 900-degree wood fire oven. \n\nthe downtown reminded me of a \"supreme/deluxe\" pizza, but definitely better. i had tried the <mark>Honey Pie</mark> during the first visit and although it wasn't one of my favorites that evening, i came to appreciate its flavors the second time around. i also tried their <mark>Classic Caesar</mark> salad ($10) and it was tasty. for drinks, i tried the strawberry fields martini ($9.50): stoli strawberry, strawberry puree and a hint of mint and hally ordered the moscow mule ($12): stoli vodka, ginger beer, and fresh squeezed lemon juice. both really delicious cocktails. \n\nfrom both visits, my favorite pizzas are the margherita, <mark>Honey Pie</mark>, and <mark>New Yorker</mark> and i absolutely loved the sweet nothing cocktail, so good. i didn't care for the <mark>Calamari Fritti</mark>, rosemary garlic fries, or the mastunicola pizza. anyway, i could eat that margherita pizza every day. it's that good. i have to keep telling myself to not order it, just so i can try their other delicious concoctions (i have my eyes on the <mark>Pizza Campari</mark>, <mark>Clam and Garlic</mark>, and proscuitto e pomodorini). hands down, definitely my favorite pizza joint now (sorry grimaldi's). but seriously, award-winning pies, five different pizza ovens, quality ingredients - you're convinced right?\n\nparking is best on the surrounding streets like on casino center blvd (meters take credit cards, yay, but you can only pay hourly at $1/hour) or free valet at the downtown grand (super easy and close). oh, and don't forget your locals discount!! win."

            "i read about the sausage & guinness pizza in an article covering the top 100 pizzas in the us and couldn't wait to try this place and pie. we had reservations for 8 and were seated right away. the service, atmosphere and food all top notch. warm and inviting and at the same time efficient. there was a vj on the night we were there playing (from the inside of a semi tractor which is in the restaurant) a mix of old school rock and new school parodies - very fun! when the pizza came it was beautiful. served up on a cutting board you could smell the rich aromas of sausage, caramelized  sweet onion and tomatoey goodness. the crust was light and crispy outside with a soft sweet still light center. i was told that the <mark>Beer Salt & Sweet Guinness Reduction</mark> in the crust and topping is what makes it so delicious. it adds a sweetness but very subtly and perfectly offset by the sausage and herbs with big gobs of melted mozzarella - yum. a must do meal if you are in old las vegas - great location just all the activity on fremont st", 
            "this review is after a one time visit  with my brother a couple of weeks ago after a 51's day game. we both enjoyed our experience and i intend to visit the location in henderson which is closer to home so i can sample more of the menu.\n\nwe came mid afternoon after parking in the deck across the street. the hostess will validate your parking ticket upon departure. we went straight to the bar and were greeted immediately and given menus. man, the menu is huge. my brother easily ended any indecisiveness by saying, \"we're all over this sausage and stout.\" done.\n\nthey are limited to 23 pizzas per day at $28 for a pizza that feeds two. you can add two pints of guinness for $5. the pizza definitely had some interesting combinations and was an interesting pairing with the beer. mainly, it was a salty/sweet clash. mozzarella, <mark>Beer Sausage</mark>, fontina, and beer salt vs. guinness <mark>Beer Dough</mark>, caramelized onion, and an almost overly <mark>Beer Salt & Sweet Guinness Reduction</mark>. this brought out the crushed red pepper on the pizza and after following with the beer, the malty and burnt tones of the guinness were accentuated even more. again, an interesting combination which had me reaching for slice after slice.\n\nwe polished off the pizza and beer and with 15% yelp check in discount, we left pleased and felt we got our money's worth. i'm looking forward to more of what pizza rock has to offer."

            "new place in dtlv, and i'm a fan! \n\nthe place is big, but i like the layout b/c the sections have a separate-like feel that flows well. the bar is spacious, with plenty of seats and eating room. in addition to their regular dining tables, there's a separate, large dining table for large parties, and cute little intimate 2-person tables too. the decor is a sort of rock 'n roll, meets construction zone, meets french provencal (mirror, chandeliers, bathroom), but it works! i also like the little touches, like paper bags as place mats and <mark><mark>Tomato Sauce</mark></mark> cans to hold silverware. the kitchen is that exposed italian pizzeria style. i wish i could do a better job at explaining the layout, but you'll just have to go and see it.\n\nthe food is really good. the calarmari was damn near perfect. ok, i can't say a bad thing about it. it was perfectly crisp (i hate soggy calamari). there's 2 ways you can order it, traditional or calabrese style. i got half and half and both were just delicious. calabrese style is the spicier version. i got the <mark>House Salad</mark>. a basic, no frills, salad. but the lettuce and tomatoes were fresh. i was pleased. the pizza i chose was the prosciutto e pomodorini. so good! i do wish the prosciutto was a little crispy (like my favorite pizza place lucifer's does their's) but it was still a yummy pizza! everything tasted so fresh and delicious. \n\nfor dessert i got the tiramisu. ok, first i want to say, i am not a huge fan of tiramisu. i've tried it several times at different places, and it never blew me away. but during my last trip to italy with the husband, he would always get it, so it became our italian vaca thing. tiramisu at every restaurant. so i began to appreciate this dessert. back to pizza rock's tiramisu... amazing! it was a large piece, my first reaction was, \"oh i'll never finish this.\" my husband had about 3 bites of it because i couldn't stop the food beast inside me.\n\ni didn't try any of their drinks, but they do have several beers on tap, wine and a full bar.\n\nanother cool thing is they have a walk-up pizza window that people passing by outside can order pizza by the slice from. awesome!\n\nthe staff is all very friendly. service was great. i am excited about this great place so close to where i live. and i highly recommend trying it out.\n\nparking is a pain, so just expect that.", 
            "we eyed the margherita pizza and saw that only 73 of them are made a day and since i only like cheese pizza it only made sense to try it. perhaps this is just me but i didn't find it delicious. you get this super thin crust pizza with a thin layer of <mark><mark>Tomato Sauce</mark></mark> and big blobs of mozzarella cheese. the crust wasn't very crispy; the <mark><mark>Tomato Sauce</mark></mark> was just okay and the cheese was just that - slightly warm, soft and mushy cheese. \n\n\napparently, locals get 20% discount. wish we knew about it. \n\n\ni might have to come back to try something else later.", 
            "coconut cooler with a hint of lime (very refreshing, really nice).  coconut curry beer (surprisingly pretty good).  a few blue moons and a spanish fly (really enjoyed the agave nectar).  chorizo mussels served in a spicy <mark><mark>Tomato Sauce</mark></mark> over thick chunks of toasted bread.  battered & fried (not greasy!) large whole artichokes served with a slightly spice aioli (nice size for the price and were slightly addicting).  and this was just the beginning (go ahead, read it again with a smile).\n\nsix hungry, hedonistic gastronomes with an expectation of sumptuous, savory sustenance drawn from a not-so-long-ago memory of amazing pizza in san francisco.  tony's pizza napoletano.\n\nwill tony's pizza be just as good here as it was in san francisco? will the hot (ok, not so hot in november), dry mojave desert climate affect the chewy goodness of tony's pizza crusts?  will two pizza's suffice?  perhaps we should opt for three?  perhaps order two and add a third later?  our friendly server, autumn, suggested placing our order all together due to several large parties.  thank you, autumn!\n\nhere goes:\n<mark>Clam and Garlic</mark> - omg.  best damn clam pizza we've had.  perfect goldilock-sized pieces of clam with garlic generously enveloping every bite.\n\ndiavola - like spicy?  we like spicy.  and we really like diavola!  a spicy pie served with generous chunks of sopressata, mozzarella, and arugala.  and oh yes, a spicy <mark><mark>Tomato Sauce</mark></mark>.  i loved that the arugala was ever so slightly wilted, providing a slight pepperiness without being overly bitter.\n\nqual <mark>Quail Egg White Rose Potato Guanciale</mark> - guanciale is one of our favorite italian pork products.  the rich flavor of the buttery guanciale paired beautifully with the delicate flavors of the potato, quail egg, and mozzarella.  very nicely done!\n\nafter consuming all but a small slice of the clam & garlic and looking at it sadly, then glancing around the table, we realized we were satisfyingly satisfied.\n\nand then autumn brought the dessert menu.  mind you, we were stuffed.  truly.  i just kept thinking how perhaps a bit of gelato would... i don't know, do... something.  so, since we started a coconut trend earlier in the evening i delightedly selected some coconut sorbet.  my sister chose the <mark>Pecan Turnover</mark> - a puff pastry brimming with a sweet maple-pecan crunch and a generous serving of ice cream on top.  the coconut sorbet was a very generous serving of refreshing coconut, and i feel badly and a little sad that i wasted so much.\n\nare you a local?  do you love pizza?  do you like hanging downtown?  me too!  and guess what?!  locals receive a discount.  oh yes.  keep me coming back, baby.  and... they have take out.  i sense mastunicola in my future (by the way, google translator is great for learning how to correctly pronounce italian pizza names).\n\nwelcome to vegas, tony and crew!  we are so glad you came.",

            "the western u.s. wrote the book on terrible pizza, but pizza rock is an exception to that rule. the overall dining experience here is 5 stars - especially in comparison to other las vegas \"pizza\" locations. but there are a few issues keeping this place from truly rocking it, as it were.\n\nmost importantly, pizza rock's menu needs serious help. someone at this restaurant needs to understand the menu, as presented, is way out of bounds when it comes to pizza menus. with pretty much any real pizza joint, you typically have your crust options followed by your topping options, and a few \"specialty\" pies, and that's it. short, sweet, simple.\n\npizza rock, in an effort to break the mold (which i always encourage) prints a large and very clunky menu that takes forever to read. although it is loosely broken down by pizza styles, each pizza (and there are many) has its own custom toppings. between the styles, names, awards, and ingredients, it is a daunting read. it's like hey you can get this italian pizza with 12 cheeses, a half pineapple and five rabbits' feet or this next pizza that won the south central tracey bonham award in 1998 and it comes with four butchered gnomes and an upside-down piano on it. \n\nthe point is, ask the server. i was so sick of reading i just requested whatever pizza rock's version of a large new york style pizza where it goes crust, <mark><mark>Tomato Sauce</mark></mark>, then cheese. and, wouldn't you know it, the pizza tasted great!\n\nthe other issue is the restrooms. terrible! no water pressure, no paper towels, and you had to pull the door inward to leave (which means touching the handle everyone else who didn't not have water or paper towels just touched, and dreading picking up your next slice of pizza.\n\npizza places must have clean bathrooms. the fact that so many reviewers don't seem to mind really gives you an idea of yelp's demographic.", 
            "***check-in and get 15% off your whole meal!***\n\ni found a deal on living social for $29 for 1 craft beer, 1 appetizer, and 1 pizza to share. it was well worth it!!  the total for this portion of our bill was $54!  \n\nwhen we walked in, this place had a nice vibe. the music was a great selection and it was the perfect volume.  we were sat near the bar, but asked to move, so we didn't have to sit on bar stool level table and chairs.  they were very accommodating and moved us no problem. \n\nof course we all ordered beers.  they have a nice selection of drafts, and an even bigger selection of bottles. \n\nwe ordered the salumi & <mark>Salumi & Formaggio Board</mark> for our appetizer. the menu describes it as - assorted salumi & formaggio, fig jam, spicy candied walnuts, rosemary focaccia toast.  it was very good and is a nice bite for 2-4 people. unfortunately, we were so hungry, i forgot to get a picture of it. :p\n\nthen for the pizza, we decided to get our money's worth of the coupon i had and ordered the biggest pizza we could.  lol! \nwe chose the romano ii. it was divided into three section with three different toppings. all three were delicious!  the pizza was thin and crispy and there were plenty of toppings <mark>Mac and Cheese</mark>. \nhere's how the menu describes it...section 1: <mark><mark>Tomato Sauce</mark></mark>, natural casing pepperoni, <mark><mark>Extra Cheese, Pepperoni, or Italian Fennel Sausage</mark></mark>; section 2: pesto, <mark><mark>Caramelized Onions</mark></mark>, <mark>Goat Cheese</mark>, <mark>Roasted Tomatoes</mark>, garlic; section 3: ricotta, garlic, basil, linguisa, <mark>Piquante Peppers</mark>\nsection 1 was perfect for that typical man \"meat lovers\" pizza. section 2 was unique with the sweetness of the <mark><mark>Caramelized Onions</mark></mark> and saltiness of the <mark>Goat Cheese</mark>.  section 3 was my favorite, even though i think they forgot the ricotta. i loved the sweetness of the <mark>Piquante Peppers</mark> (like a roasted red pepper), and the linguisa is very similar to their pepperoni. \n\nduring our meal the gm came over and asked us how we were enjoying it and even told us all about the business, from the encouragement of my aussie friend. \n\nwould definitely go back and will!!!",

            "today is day one of the week long grand opening for pizza rock!  so excited to hear another new establishment has moved downtown!  what's even better was i heard they were showcasing their menu for the public and fine tune the overall experience for the actual opening on saturday.  originally, we heard you needed reservations to eat there for free this week, however, a coworker mentioned to us that folks working downtown will be able to roll in without reservations and be seated for dinner.  this was a perfect opportunity for a couple of us to have a nice dinner after a hard day's work!\n\nthe restaurant is on the corner of ogden and 3rd st, attached to the mob bar and triple george saloon.  right away, you notice the huge \"pizza rock\" sign from the outside, bordered by flame artwork.  when you enter, there's a nice seating area with a very friendly hostess station.  everyone was super excited to greet you and take your name.  because of the grand opening, we were able to walk around the restaurant and take a look at the decor.  to the right of the hostess stand was the pizza takeout window with a viewable kitchen.  pretty cool.  after the seating area, the main focal point of the restaurant is the life sized semi truck in the middle of the dining area.  super cool!  it serves as a multi purpose art.  aside from the obvious attention grabber, it's the new dj station and serves to break up the bar area and dining area.  wow! the bar is huge and gorgeous!  lots of metal art accents around it.  lots of exposed brick around the restaurant.  they even have little private coves for seating in the dining area if you want to entertain that romantic date or have an intimate family dinner.  lots going on and it all seems to work.  \n\nwhen we were greeted by our server, shirley, we were informed of a couple of things:  they didn't have pasta, they didn't have bread, they didn't have sausage and they didn't have steak.  kind of bummed about it but everything else was free so i couldn't really complain.  shirley was a bit flustered as i expected on day one.  she quoted the wrong price for wine, ordered our food at different times which resulted in a lot of waiting and found herself making multiple trips to the table, because of the lack of efficiency.  i completely understand.  first day jitters are a given.  she had a great personality and that ended up going a long way in my book.\n\nfor dinner, here's what we got:\n\n<mark>Classic Caesar</mark>, normally for $10.00:  hearts of romaine, homemade caesar dressing, house croutons and shaved pieces of parmigiano-reggiano.  definitely a shareable dish.  i think this could comfortable feed 3 people as their first course.  lots of fresh ingredients, but i didn't have a few issues with this salad.  the croutons were way too toasted and very crunchy.  the dressing, as being the star of the dish was way too tangy.  they made it with a lot of anchovies.  now i'm a huge fan of homemade caesar dressing but this was way too overpowered with anchovies.\n\nmargherita pizza, normally for $15.00:  this pizza was a 2007 world pizza cup winner in italy!  hand mixed dough using imported flour and proofed in wood boxed imported from italy.  wow.  san marzano tomatoes, mozzarella cheese, basil, extra virgin olive oil and <mark>Sea Salt</mark>.  the dough from the crust was amazing but the crust turned out a little burnt and had a slightly bitter taste.  the sauce was one of the stars of the show, nice and creamy.  mozzarella was flavorful and there were a lot for a margherita, which was awesome.  the only critique was the basil.  not enough to taste that element which makes a great pie. \n\ndowntown pizza, normally for $19.00:  wow, lots going on!  mozzarella, pepperoni, salami, bacon, chives, mushrooms, read onions, bell peppers, olives, <mark><mark>Extra Cheese, Pepperoni, or Italian Fennel Sausage</mark></mark> and <mark><mark>Cherry Tomato</mark></mark>.  think of it as an upgraded supreme.  with all these ingredients, there was no lack of flavor!  wow loved the flavor punch.  my only feedback was the crust was too thin for this pizza.  it couldn't support the amount of toppings.  it became soggy real fast and we ended up losing a lot of the toppings on the table.  \n\nmanhattan calzone, normally for $12.00:  stuffed with meatballs, mozzarella, ricotta <mark>Clam and Garlic</mark>.  as my friend put it, you would pay 12 bucks f<mark>Classic Pepperoni or Cheese</mark> and bread.  lots of cheese.  omg, it was everywhere.  i personally don't think ricotta is needed.  maybe use a lot more meat to balance out the cheese.  holy cheese!  \n\nduring this week, all menu food items are free.  our entire bill was comped which was the best part of the evening.  please remember to tip your servers great!  this review, i've created, is to give the best and most valuable feedback, so this place thrives downtown.  just the ambiance alone will take them far.  i will certainly be back to try other items of the menu.  next time, i'm hitting the steak and pasta hard!", 
            "this place is great!  from the dj spinning classic rock in a semi-truck to the guy spinning pizza, it is a great time.  the garlic bread was cheesy and <mark>Garlic</mark> and the pepperoni pizza was heaven!  the vibe in the restaurant is super cool and the service was top-notch!!", 
            "coconut cooler with a hint of lime (very refreshing, really nice).  coconut curry beer (surprisingly pretty good).  a few blue moons and a spanish fly (really enjoyed the agave nectar).  chorizo mussels served in a spicy <mark><mark>Tomato Sauce</mark></mark> over thick chunks of toasted bread.  battered & fried (not greasy!) large whole artichokes served with a slightly spice aioli (nice size for the price and were slightly addicting).  and this was just the beginning (go ahead, read it again with a smile).\n\nsix hungry, hedonistic gastronomes with an expectation of sumptuous, savory sustenance drawn from a not-so-long-ago memory of amazing pizza in san francisco.  tony's pizza napoletano.\n\nwill tony's pizza be just as good here as it was in san francisco? will the hot (ok, not so hot in november), dry mojave desert climate affect the chewy goodness of tony's pizza crusts?  will two pizza's suffice?  perhaps we should opt for three?  perhaps order two and add a third later?  our friendly server, autumn, suggested placing our order all together due to several large parties.  thank you, autumn!\n\nhere goes:\n<mark>Clam and Garlic</mark> - omg.  best damn clam pizza we've had.  perfect goldilock-sized pieces of clam with garlic generously enveloping every bite.\n\ndiavola - like spicy?  we like spicy.  and we really like diavola!  a spicy pie served with generous chunks of sopressata, mozzarella, and arugala.  and oh yes, a spicy <mark><mark>Tomato Sauce</mark></mark>.  i loved that the arugala was ever so slightly wilted, providing a slight pepperiness without being overly bitter.\n\nqual <mark>Quail Egg White Rose Potato Guanciale</mark> - guanciale is one of our favorite italian pork products.  the rich flavor of the buttery guanciale paired beautifully with the delicate flavors of the potato, quail egg, and mozzarella.  very nicely done!\n\nafter consuming all but a small slice of the clam & garlic and looking at it sadly, then glancing around the table, we realized we were satisfyingly satisfied.\n\nand then autumn brought the dessert menu.  mind you, we were stuffed.  truly.  i just kept thinking how perhaps a bit of gelato would... i don't know, do... something.  so, since we started a coconut trend earlier in the evening i delightedly selected some coconut sorbet.  my sister chose the <mark>Pecan Turnover</mark> - a puff pastry brimming with a sweet maple-pecan crunch and a generous serving of ice cream on top.  the coconut sorbet was a very generous serving of refreshing coconut, and i feel badly and a little sad that i wasted so much.\n\nare you a local?  do you love pizza?  do you like hanging downtown?  me too!  and guess what?!  locals receive a discount.  oh yes.  keep me coming back, baby.  and... they have take out.  i sense mastunicola in my future (by the way, google translator is great for learning how to correctly pronounce italian pizza names).\n\nwelcome to vegas, tony and crew!  we are so glad you came.", 
            "this restaurant was recommended to us by a hotel employee. she said it was the best pizza she had found in las vegas. great menu and awesome beer list. full bar too. good music playing as well. was loud enough to enjoy but not too loud where you couldn't talk. we started with the garlic cheese bread. was good and you could see the garlic pieces on it. yum! then got the <mark>New Yorker</mark> pizza. wow! great flavor, <mark>Garlic</mark> and perfect thin crust. give this place a try!!! and when you do, try to get sarah (red headed waitress) to be your server. her advice was great! she knows her beers and she definitely knows her pizza!", 
            "i've now been to pizza rock twice. first things first, why not 5 stars? basically because i've been here twice and i have never been told that locals receive 20% off their bill. what the heck pizza rock? i don't typically go around asking, hey can i get a local discount? but. when i've been here twice and sung its praises to people - and yet, i've been able to get 20% off but haven't? arg. that ruffles my feathers.\n\non to what is good. happy hour is awesome. personal pizzas, apps, well drinks, and cocktails all on the cheap. my friends and i came here during hh and split all three of the personal pizzas and shared <mark>The Butcher 'All Meat'</mark>. okay. i'm no meatball expert but i think these are delicious. meaty, not bready, and the sauce it comes with compliments very well. i also like that these meatballs are simple. i've had way too many meatballs that have way too much going on with them. another reason i like them: you can cut them down the middle with your fork and they fall away in two pieces, not a bunch of lumpy, gross meat pieces. quality. i think.\n\nother than hh.... i came here with my hubby on a saturday night. luckily they have plenty of 2-top tables so we were seated quickly. service was quick and to the point. our server neither impressed me or upset me so i'll give a neutral rating for service.\n\nwhat we ordered... the <mark>New Yorker</mark> 23. it was the one pizza on the menu i figured my picky (and rather plain-jane) husband would enjoy. the <mark>New Yorker</mark> comes with: sliced mozzarella, <mark><mark>Tomato Sauce</mark></mark>, sliced house link sausage, garlic, pepperoni, ricotta. i asked for the link sausages to be removed and replaced with mushrooms. they were happy to oblige. under the menu it says, \"winner, best traditional, las vegas\". i'm not sure what that means.\n\noverall thoughts on the pizza... i enjoyed it. i love the thin crust style. the mix of cheese and sauce was perfect. pepperoni... okay. the ricotta cheese was an awesome addition, creamy and slightly sweet offsetting the heartiness of the pepperoni <mark>Clam and Garlic</mark>. the flavors were that of a \"normal\" pizza, but with a refinement. i think this was a perfect way to satisfy my more adventurous side and my husband's more traditional side.\n\nfinal decision: mine and my husband's dinner was a bit pricey. although delicious, i would rather go back for the happy hour. hh is your best bet here. and ya, go ahead and throw in the fact you're a local. you'll probably get a discount, unlike me. i'd also be interested in just heading up to the take out window to take a slice to go.\n\nother things i want to go back for:\n\ntheir margherita (only 73 made per day)\n<mark>Clam and Garlic</mark> pizza\n<mark>La Regina</mark> (the gold cup winner)\n<mark>Quail Egg White Rose Potato Guanciale</mark> pizza\n<mark>Cal Italia</mark> (again, this comes as one of the personal pizzas on hh menu and is a foodnetwork winner)\nthe chorizo mussels (app)\nand i would come back again for <mark>The Butcher 'All Meat'</mark>.\n\nlooks, like i'll be making a few return trips. the great thing is, i am so happy there is a good, inventive pizza place so close to where i live now.",

            "this post is overdue, but then again, when am i not behind? a couple weeks ago, we went downtown to try pizza rock. it's owned by tony gemignani you might know him from bar rescue. we also know of him because of his restaurant is san francisco, tonys pizza napoletana. upon returning from our recent trip, i checked to see how the menus compare... they're practically identical. that meant those delicious meatballs could be had right here at home. we only hoped they were just as good. \n\nmy brother joined us and we got there in time for happy hour (mon-fri 3-6; sun-thur 10-close). beers, appetizers and pizzas are discounted (local's discount does not apply). they have a great craft beer selection ($5) so they hooked me on that alone. we each ordered meatballs ($3). <mark>The Butcher 'All Meat'</mark> itself was just as good as those in san francisco, but the sauce was too acidic. hopefully, the kitchen is still tweaking the recipe. still, we enjoyed them. we shared an order of garlic bread ($5). very <mark>Garlic</mark>, but otherwise unmemorable. \n\nwe each ordered a personal pizza from the happy hour menu. this was a great savings and a way to try pizzas we typically wouldn't order. <mark>Frank's True Italian (Thin Crust)</mark> ($7) had pesto garlic and it was topped with mozzarella and <mark><mark>Cherry Tomato</mark></mark>. this was our favorite of the three. \n \nthe pepperoni had some kick ($5) but it was the least liked crust and <mark>Cal Italia</mark> ($7) was too sweet for my liking; it seemed like dessert. however, it came highly recommended from our server and it has won awards. it has sweet fig preserve and topped with mozzarella, gorgonzola, and prosciutto. \n\npizzas i've had at tony's have been far more impressive so next time i'll stick to the regular menu for pizza, but i'll definitely enjoy those $3 meatballs and $5 craft beers again.", 
            "this place knows good pizza.  the dough and crust seriously rock - perfectly cooked just the way they do in the northeast or in italy.  i had the <mark>Clam and Garlic</mark> pizza which was totally delicious, though i would have rather had the claims served out of the shell.  i'm a big dessert guy, and while the <mark>Dessert Calzone</mark> wasn't bad, i'd probably go for something sweeter next time.  major points for having ginger beer on the drinks menu.  service was excellent.  next time i'm in vegas i'll be coming back.",

            "their pizza is out of this world. that's all you need to know.\n\nmy first visit was during yelp helps week and it was a great setting to try this eatery since there were so many of us, which meant that we had the opportunity to try so many different pies (of course, that also meant we were stuffed!). that night, i tried eight of their pies, a couple appetizers, desserts, and a cocktail. everything was so good that i returned just four days later with my fiance and friend hally!\n\nduring my return visit, i had to order the margherita ($16) again. the dough is hand-mixed with san felice flour and proofed in neapolitan wood boxes, then it's topped with san marzano tomatoes, mozzarella, fior di latte, basil, evoo, and <mark>Sea Salt</mark>. finally, it's baked in a 900-degree wood stefano ferrara oven. it's limited to 73 pies daily (although i heard they've gotten no where near that amount yet) and it won the world pizza cup in naples, italy. true neopolitan pizza! \n\nthe three of us also shared the downtown ($19): pepperoni, molinari salami, bacon, chives, mushrooms, red onions, bell peppers, <mark>Black Olives</mark>, <mark><mark>Extra Cheese, Pepperoni, or Italian Fennel Sausage</mark></mark>, <mark><mark>Cherry Tomato</mark></mark>; which is one of their \"american originals\" pizzas that all feature <mark><mark>Tomato Sauce</mark></mark>, mozzarella, and a rustic medium crust, baked in a gas brick oven at 550 degrees. as well as the <mark>Honey Pie</mark> ($17): quail hollow farm honey, calabrese peppers, <mark>Green Onions</mark>, mozzarella, piave cheese, fried <mark><mark>Caramelized Onions</mark></mark>, serrano peppers; one of their \"california\" pizzas that use caputo flour and baked in a 900-degree wood fire oven. \n\nthe downtown reminded me of a \"supreme/deluxe\" pizza, but definitely better. i had tried the <mark>Honey Pie</mark> during the first visit and although it wasn't one of my favorites that evening, i came to appreciate its flavors the second time around. i also tried their <mark>Classic Caesar</mark> salad ($10) and it was tasty. for drinks, i tried the strawberry fields martini ($9.50): stoli strawberry, strawberry puree and a hint of mint and hally ordered the moscow mule ($12): stoli vodka, ginger beer, and fresh squeezed lemon juice. both really delicious cocktails. \n\nfrom both visits, my favorite pizzas are the margherita, <mark>Honey Pie</mark>, and <mark>New Yorker</mark> and i absolutely loved the sweet nothing cocktail, so good. i didn't care for the <mark>Calamari Fritti</mark>, rosemary garlic fries, or the mastunicola pizza. anyway, i could eat that margherita pizza every day. it's that good. i have to keep telling myself to not order it, just so i can try their other delicious concoctions (i have my eyes on the <mark>Pizza Campari</mark>, <mark>Clam and Garlic</mark>, and proscuitto e pomodorini). hands down, definitely my favorite pizza joint now (sorry grimaldi's). but seriously, award-winning pies, five different pizza ovens, quality ingredients - you're convinced right?\n\nparking is best on the surrounding streets like on casino center blvd (meters take credit cards, yay, but you can only pay hourly at $1/hour) or free valet at the downtown grand (super easy and close). oh, and don't forget your locals discount!! win.", 
            "dude, a gem within the downtown area,  drove into vegas late so we had to find a place to eat before the boozing that wasn't the taco stand or hot dog place. come for the 90's music videos on big ass tv's and stay for the food! the fries are delicious, sprinkled with rosemary <mark>Clam and Garlic</mark>! what!? yum. late night happy hour was a plus,  starts at 12 $3 off signature drinks and $5 craft beers. the hubby says the selection of craft beer is decent, like 3-4 ipas & just a good variety on tap. \"bald ryan\" was a delight as a server and informed us of sunday brunch with live music that we may have to come back and check out! woop woo",

            "i have a hard time finding good pizza in vegas and so far i have only found 2 places i love everything about their pizza at and this on my top 2. \n\n<mark>Calamari Fritti</mark>* 13\ntraditional or calabrese style with \ncalabrese aioli and marinara dipping sauces\n\ngreat dipping sauces and good calamari. pricey for an appetizer. \n\n<mark>Beer Battered Fried Artichokes</mark> 8.5\nwith calabrese aioli\n\nhmm wish it had more than 2 pieces, this was delicious!\n\n<mark>New Yorker</mark> 23\nwinner, best traditional in the world, vegas\nsliced mozzarella, <mark><mark>Tomato Sauce</mark></mark>, sliced house link sausage, \ngarlic, pepperoni, ricotta\n\nthe ricotta was not how i usually see ricotta on a pizza. this was whipped and light and i can't say i was a huge fan of it, but as you can see i still give the place 4 stars. if the ricotta was not whipped and so soft, i would have liked it thicker if that makes sense. it would have been absolute perfection of a pizza! \n\nthe pepperoni was top notch, and this is coming from someone who hates pepperoni. i never get pepperoni on pizza. it was small, crispy, and tasty. although a bit greasy, nowhere near what i think of when i think of pepperoni. i am just glad i tried what real pepperoni should be and now i can't say i hate pepperoni. sausage, i would never ever choose sausage on a pizza but i was with my friend and hubby and majority rules. well, this sausage was really good. i rarely ever say that about sausage or any meat on my pizza. the combinations of flavors on this pizza was perfect. the toppings were spread out perfectly getting a bite of almost everything in each bite. the dough was perfect and cooked to perfection, also tasted good and i ate the crust. this pizza dough was exactly the pizza i like. \n\nthe service was very good for being as crowded as they were. i was actually surprised by the good service we got with that many people in the restaurant.  our waiter was so friendly and came around just the right amount of times. i did not need to hunt him down for more water, and he did not come often enough that it was annoying. \n\ni was expecting rock music since they are called pizza rock, but i did not hear rock music. i heard music that reminded me of skating at the skating rink in junior high. i enjoyed it, but it was really really really loud. i could not hear my friend who was sitting right in front of me. \n\none of their downfalls for me is their location. it works for them though and i am sure brings the great business. i am just being selfish and prefer to go to restaurants not on the strip or not in downtown.  the wait was a one hour wait (i hate waiting for food) and they were extremely packed! i saw bachelorette parties, wedding parties, large parties, and all kinds of interesting people (people who looked dressed up for a marathon, literally ran the marathon then came in for pizza? love that). it was a tourist crowd for sure. parking is a bit of pain coming from someone who got spoiled by vegas' easy parking. but, it won't stop me from coming, it just is more of a \"hassle\" being in downtown area near fremont. i wish they would open one in downtown summerlin *hint hint*. \n\nall of their pizzas look amazing and i can't wait to try the prosciutto and pear, <mark>Clam and Garlic</mark> (brings back childhood memories of clam pizza on venice beach-i have not had clam pizza since and would love to try theirs), <mark>Cal Italia</mark>, and more. \n\n-1 star only because music was too loud, waits are long, ricotta was weird to me, and a bit pricey. it won't stop me from coming back because i really enjoyed the majority of everything in this restaurant, specifically the pizza. \n\ni did get a yelp check in offer and was very happy about that!!", 
            "i've been meaning to try pizza rock. i learned that they opened another branch in green valley ranch but i figured i must go and try the original location first. \n\nwe went here on a weekend and the place was pretty packed. the host was attentive and seated us right away. i would describe this place as a bar kind of place rather than a restaurant. the music was loud. trying to have a conversation it was a little bit of a challenge. \n\nwe ordered the <mark>White Wine Clams</mark> for appetizers. it was so good! the <mark>Garlic</mark> sauce was perfect for dipping with their complimentary bread. we opted to get the classic margherita pizza. this too was excellent. the crust was perfectly charred which added to the great flavor of the pizza. \n\ni think this is one of the best go-to places in downtown. it is worth the drive just to go try this place.",

            "today is day one of the week long grand opening for pizza rock!  so excited to hear another new establishment has moved downtown!  what's even better was i heard they were showcasing their menu for the public and fine tune the overall experience for the actual opening on saturday.  originally, we heard you needed reservations to eat there for free this week, however, a coworker mentioned to us that folks working downtown will be able to roll in without reservations and be seated for dinner.  this was a perfect opportunity for a couple of us to have a nice dinner after a hard day's work!\n\nthe restaurant is on the corner of ogden and 3rd st, attached to the mob bar and triple george saloon.  right away, you notice the huge \"pizza rock\" sign from the outside, bordered by flame artwork.  when you enter, there's a nice seating area with a very friendly hostess station.  everyone was super excited to greet you and take your name.  because of the grand opening, we were able to walk around the restaurant and take a look at the decor.  to the right of the hostess stand was the pizza takeout window with a viewable kitchen.  pretty cool.  after the seating area, the main focal point of the restaurant is the life sized semi truck in the middle of the dining area.  super cool!  it serves as a multi purpose art.  aside from the obvious attention grabber, it's the new dj station and serves to break up the bar area and dining area.  wow! the bar is huge and gorgeous!  lots of metal art accents around it.  lots of exposed brick around the restaurant.  they even have little private coves for seating in the dining area if you want to entertain that romantic date or have an intimate family dinner.  lots going on and it all seems to work.  \n\nwhen we were greeted by our server, shirley, we were informed of a couple of things:  they didn't have pasta, they didn't have bread, they didn't have sausage and they didn't have steak.  kind of bummed about it but everything else was free so i couldn't really complain.  shirley was a bit flustered as i expected on day one.  she quoted the wrong price for wine, ordered our food at different times which resulted in a lot of waiting and found herself making multiple trips to the table, because of the lack of efficiency.  i completely understand.  first day jitters are a given.  she had a great personality and that ended up going a long way in my book.\n\nfor dinner, here's what we got:\n\n<mark>Classic Caesar</mark>, normally for $10.00:  hearts of romaine, homemade caesar dressing, house croutons and shaved pieces of parmigiano-reggiano.  definitely a shareable dish.  i think this could comfortable feed 3 people as their first course.  lots of fresh ingredients, but i didn't have a few issues with this salad.  the croutons were way too toasted and very crunchy.  the dressing, as being the star of the dish was way too tangy.  they made it with a lot of anchovies.  now i'm a huge fan of homemade caesar dressing but this was way too overpowered with anchovies.\n\nmargherita pizza, normally for $15.00:  this pizza was a 2007 world pizza cup winner in italy!  hand mixed dough using imported flour and proofed in wood boxed imported from italy.  wow.  san marzano tomatoes, mozzarella cheese, basil, extra virgin olive oil and <mark>Sea Salt</mark>.  the dough from the crust was amazing but the crust turned out a little burnt and had a slightly bitter taste.  the sauce was one of the stars of the show, nice and creamy.  mozzarella was flavorful and there were a lot for a margherita, which was awesome.  the only critique was the basil.  not enough to taste that element which makes a great pie. \n\ndowntown pizza, normally for $19.00:  wow, lots going on!  mozzarella, pepperoni, salami, bacon, chives, mushrooms, read onions, bell peppers, olives, <mark><mark>Extra Cheese, Pepperoni, or Italian Fennel Sausage</mark></mark> and <mark><mark>Cherry Tomato</mark></mark>.  think of it as an upgraded supreme.  with all these ingredients, there was no lack of flavor!  wow loved the flavor punch.  my only feedback was the crust was too thin for this pizza.  it couldn't support the amount of toppings.  it became soggy real fast and we ended up losing a lot of the toppings on the table.  \n\nmanhattan calzone, normally for $12.00:  stuffed with meatballs, mozzarella, ricotta <mark>Clam and Garlic</mark>.  as my friend put it, you would pay 12 bucks f<mark>Classic Pepperoni or Cheese</mark> and bread.  lots of cheese.  omg, it was everywhere.  i personally don't think ricotta is needed.  maybe use a lot more meat to balance out the cheese.  holy cheese!  \n\nduring this week, all menu food items are free.  our entire bill was comped which was the best part of the evening.  please remember to tip your servers great!  this review, i've created, is to give the best and most valuable feedback, so this place thrives downtown.  just the ambiance alone will take them far.  i will certainly be back to try other items of the menu.  next time, i'm hitting the steak and pasta hard!", 
            "their pizza is out of this world. that's all you need to know.\n\nmy first visit was during yelp helps week and it was a great setting to try this eatery since there were so many of us, which meant that we had the opportunity to try so many different pies (of course, that also meant we were stuffed!). that night, i tried eight of their pies, a couple appetizers, desserts, and a cocktail. everything was so good that i returned just four days later with my fiance and friend hally!\n\nduring my return visit, i had to order the margherita ($16) again. the dough is hand-mixed with san felice flour and proofed in neapolitan wood boxes, then it's topped with san marzano tomatoes, mozzarella, fior di latte, basil, evoo, and <mark>Sea Salt</mark>. finally, it's baked in a 900-degree wood stefano ferrara oven. it's limited to 73 pies daily (although i heard they've gotten no where near that amount yet) and it won the world pizza cup in naples, italy. true neopolitan pizza! \n\nthe three of us also shared the downtown ($19): pepperoni, molinari salami, bacon, chives, mushrooms, red onions, bell peppers, <mark>Black Olives</mark>, <mark><mark>Extra Cheese, Pepperoni, or Italian Fennel Sausage</mark></mark>, <mark><mark>Cherry Tomato</mark></mark>; which is one of their \"american originals\" pizzas that all feature <mark><mark>Tomato Sauce</mark></mark>, mozzarella, and a rustic medium crust, baked in a gas brick oven at 550 degrees. as well as the <mark>Honey Pie</mark> ($17): quail hollow farm honey, calabrese peppers, <mark>Green Onions</mark>, mozzarella, piave cheese, fried <mark><mark>Caramelized Onions</mark></mark>, serrano peppers; one of their \"california\" pizzas that use caputo flour and baked in a 900-degree wood fire oven. \n\nthe downtown reminded me of a \"supreme/deluxe\" pizza, but definitely better. i had tried the <mark>Honey Pie</mark> during the first visit and although it wasn't one of my favorites that evening, i came to appreciate its flavors the second time around. i also tried their <mark>Classic Caesar</mark> salad ($10) and it was tasty. for drinks, i tried the strawberry fields martini ($9.50): stoli strawberry, strawberry puree and a hint of mint and hally ordered the moscow mule ($12): stoli vodka, ginger beer, and fresh squeezed lemon juice. both really delicious cocktails. \n\nfrom both visits, my favorite pizzas are the margherita, <mark>Honey Pie</mark>, and <mark>New Yorker</mark> and i absolutely loved the sweet nothing cocktail, so good. i didn't care for the <mark>Calamari Fritti</mark>, rosemary garlic fries, or the mastunicola pizza. anyway, i could eat that margherita pizza every day. it's that good. i have to keep telling myself to not order it, just so i can try their other delicious concoctions (i have my eyes on the <mark>Pizza Campari</mark>, <mark>Clam and Garlic</mark>, and proscuitto e pomodorini). hands down, definitely my favorite pizza joint now (sorry grimaldi's). but seriously, award-winning pies, five different pizza ovens, quality ingredients - you're convinced right?\n\nparking is best on the surrounding streets like on casino center blvd (meters take credit cards, yay, but you can only pay hourly at $1/hour) or free valet at the downtown grand (super easy and close). oh, and don't forget your locals discount!! win.", 
            "tasty <mark>Classic Meatballs</mark>, and...\n\n5-stars for the chicago cracker thin pizza. this is the only pizza to get here imo! i've had it twice now over the course of 3 separate visits. \n\ngetting the chicago cracker thin '<mark>Old Chicago</mark>' style means it comes with: <mark><mark>Tomato Sauce</mark></mark>, mozzarella, provolone, garlic, <mark>Extra Cheese, Pepperoni, or Italian Fennel Sausage</mark>, sliced meatballs, ricotta, romano and oregano. perfect! the cracker-thin crust is spot-on and just like my favorite hole-in-the-wall pizza joint near midway airport in chicago. it comes out perfectly toasty and savory, and cut into squares as it should be. you will not feel stuffed, just satisfied.\n\nif you're up in the air as to which style pizza to get because there are so many to choose from, you gotta pick the chicago cracker thin pizza. walking through the restaurant on the way to the men's restroom and back, i wish everyone had a chicago cracker thin pizza on their pizza racks instead of the more traditional pies they chose. from the looks of it, the average person likes bready pizza with pepperoni on it. or at least that's what they think they like.\n\nchicago cracker thin. the only way i rock pizza rock.", 
            "ok pizza rock, you have come full circle in my eyes. maybe it was just learning your menu and what worked for me. with so many types of pizza i was bound to love some/ hate some but i've found my jam. the chicago style thin crust pizza is just the stuff i ordered growing up. so good and loaded with <mark>Extra Cheese, Pepperoni, or Italian Fennel Sausage</mark> and spicy sausage. perfect! \ni have also discovered the happy hour menu and it's probably my favorite hh menu around town. 3 huge meatballs for $3 and a 1 topping personal pizza for $5 or specialty pizza for $7. well drinks $3! seriously. awesome. oh and the staff is always super friendly, especially at the bar.", 
            "***check-in and get 15% off your whole meal!***\n\ni found a deal on living social for $29 for 1 craft beer, 1 appetizer, and 1 pizza to share. it was well worth it!!  the total for this portion of our bill was $54!  \n\nwhen we walked in, this place had a nice vibe. the music was a great selection and it was the perfect volume.  we were sat near the bar, but asked to move, so we didn't have to sit on bar stool level table and chairs.  they were very accommodating and moved us no problem. \n\nof course we all ordered beers.  they have a nice selection of drafts, and an even bigger selection of bottles. \n\nwe ordered the salumi & <mark>Salumi & Formaggio Board</mark> for our appetizer. the menu describes it as - assorted salumi & formaggio, fig jam, spicy candied walnuts, rosemary focaccia toast.  it was very good and is a nice bite for 2-4 people. unfortunately, we were so hungry, i forgot to get a picture of it. :p\n\nthen for the pizza, we decided to get our money's worth of the coupon i had and ordered the biggest pizza we could.  lol! \nwe chose the romano ii. it was divided into three section with three different toppings. all three were delicious!  the pizza was thin and crispy and there were plenty of toppings <mark>Mac and Cheese</mark>. \nhere's how the menu describes it...section 1: <mark><mark>Tomato Sauce</mark></mark>, natural casing pepperoni, <mark><mark>Extra Cheese, Pepperoni, or Italian Fennel Sausage</mark></mark>; section 2: pesto, <mark><mark>Caramelized Onions</mark></mark>, <mark>Goat Cheese</mark>, <mark>Roasted Tomatoes</mark>, garlic; section 3: ricotta, garlic, basil, linguisa, <mark>Piquante Peppers</mark>\nsection 1 was perfect for that typical man \"meat lovers\" pizza. section 2 was unique with the sweetness of the <mark><mark>Caramelized Onions</mark></mark> and saltiness of the <mark>Goat Cheese</mark>.  section 3 was my favorite, even though i think they forgot the ricotta. i loved the sweetness of the <mark>Piquante Peppers</mark> (like a roasted red pepper), and the linguisa is very similar to their pepperoni. \n\nduring our meal the gm came over and asked us how we were enjoying it and even told us all about the business, from the encouragement of my aussie friend. \n\nwould definitely go back and will!!!", 
            "we came here on a thursday evening and ordered \n1. <mark>Calamari Fritti</mark>, 13\n- traditional or calabrese style with calabrese aioli and marinara dipping sauces \n2. american  original - downtown, 20 \n- mozzarella, pepperoni, molinari salami, bacon, sahhlots, mushrooms, red onions, bell peppers, <mark>Black Olives</mark>, <mark><mark>Extra Cheese, Pepperoni, or Italian Fennel Sausage</mark></mark>, <mark><mark>Cherry Tomato</mark></mark>\n3. soda, unlimited refills, 3\nfor 7 (used the living social deal - $29 for $8 beer, antipasti, and pizza (excludes ny22\")\n\n- parking is pretty lame. we tried binions because they have free parking with validation, but they took out the validation next the cashiers! fail. so there practically isn't anymore free parking on the strip. you gotta eat at their restaurant or actively gamble. $8 for 1.5hrs. shiet...\n- got in around 9pm, seated in a few minutes. sat in the back, next to the bar, right next to a speaker, great place to have a screaming conversation.\n- ran out of sicilian style dough. just our luck. \"just served the last one 15 min ago.\" i guess if we came earlier, we wouldn't have had to deal with that problem. we actually wanted to order <mark>The Mob Boss</mark> pizza instead because the crust is thicker with sicilian style. i'm not much of a fan of \"the potato chip like pizza\" or should i say thin crust. haha \n-because we sat next to a speaker, our server, chelsei, couldn't really hear us over the music. after several ahem, excuse meess....one of them got through, and she handed us utensils and napkins after we got our antipasti. who eats calamari with a fork and towel anyway? haha. come on now...anyway, she was very good at drink refills and attentive thereafter. \n- the calamari was great. we got it half and half. i recommend it bc after i ate a few spicy, i needed to balance it out with one regular. spicy one or calabrese style tasted better. chelsei hooked it up with dat extra dip doe. haha. needed that for the extra dunkers na mmm saying. lol. \n- the downtown was fresh. loved the <mark><mark>Cherry Tomato</mark></mark>, so red. 6 slices. didn't like the uncooked onions. peeled off. wood fire pizza nom! \n\nbreak down of the living social deal...\n- so if you choose the most expensive antipasti, which is  the calamari at $13 and the most expensive pizza, romana, at $35, get the beer $8, then technically, you can get the saving at 48%. \n- i probably should have just saved the deal for another day and just used the yelp check-in promo of 15% off.", 
            "the food was fantastic! we had <mark><mark>Extra Cheese, Pepperoni, or Italian Fennel Sausage</mark></mark> mac-n-cheese and the pizza margherita. the portions were generous and the prices were  right. we'll definitely come back and we'll be bringing friends with.\n\np.s. this is a great place to watch football!",

            "on saturday before life is beautiful, we decided to come here and watch college football. the bar had plenty of seating so we grabbed some seats and ordered drinks. our bartender was nice enough to accommodate our request for the spartans game.\n\nonto the menu! they have a nice beer selection, and the menu for pizza is huge. it's divided into all these different styles. there's really no small, medium, large. each style of pizza comes in a set size. \n\nwe picked the <mark>New Yorker</mark>, which i would say feeds about 3 people. i wanted to order more things, but the bf knew my eyes were much hungrier than my stomach, and plus we didn't have anywhere to store leftovers as we were going to the festival after. good call because i was stuffed. anyway, omg, this pizza was soooo good!  i think it was <mark>Extra Cheese, Pepperoni, or Italian Fennel Sausage</mark>, mushroom, fresh mozzerella, and little dollops of ricotta on a thin chewy crust. everything about this pizza was amazing. in fact, i think i even said, \"this might be the best pizza i've ever eaten.\" \n\nwhen i came to pizza rock for the yelp elite event, i have to say i was not that impressed. it's probably because they weren't prepared for how many people were there and everything was just chaos and the food wasn't prepared as well. who knows. all i know is this time around the pizza was on point!\n\nmy only complaint is that the drinks are so expensive. $12 for a moscow mule? aren't we downtown at a pizza joint? i guess that's downtown prices now. either way, i can't wait to go back and get more pizza!  also, they serve by the slice at the window by the entrance.", 
            "while i've been here more since my last review in june, i went twice last week because the person i was with had not been there yet. after the first time, we were back the very next day.  we had the <mark>New Yorker</mark> the first day which was <mark>Extra Cheese, Pepperoni, or Italian Fennel Sausage</mark>, and ricotta dollops on it. amazing!  i'm actually starting to like the thinner crust more and more each time i visit.  no need for me to divulge in thick crust.   the second day, he got the same pizza, and i had the chicken parmesan. the chicken was cooked perfectly, the crust around it was crispy and perfect, sauce <mark>Mac and Cheese</mark> all delish. the only thing i didn't like was the bucatini pasta under it. it's quite thick and either wasn't cooked long enough, or that's just how it is...either way, i wasn't a fan so if i do order that again, i'll go for a different type of pasta.",

            "the atmosphere is good and so are the drinks but the pizza isn't the best i've had by far. we're local so i think i'll just stick to johnny macs. \n\nwe ordered the <mark>New Yorker</mark> and our waitress said it was the most popular but out of the ground of 6 of us - no one liked it. the best thing about the pizza (and why they get 3 stars) is that the <mark><mark>Extra Cheese, Pepperoni, or Italian Fennel Sausage</mark></mark> on it is the best. however the mixture of way too much sauce and the ricotta cheese dollops they put on it is just a weird texture, the ricotta cheese was dry and the sauce was wet and when they came together it just didn't work. i picked off the toppings and ate the crust, best part of the pizza. we ordered a second pizza, i believe it was the chicago style and it had no sauce but still great toppings, i wanted our pizzas to merge and make one really awesome pizza. \n\nthe garlic rosemary fries were okay, as well as the garlic bread but both needed more garlic.", 
            "great selection of pizza from thin, traditional, or thick crust. excellent topping/combo selections. awesome happy hour with drink and food specials. and great service!\n\ni ordered the <mark>Old Chicago</mark> featuring <mark>Extra Cheese, Pepperoni, or Italian Fennel Sausage</mark>, mozzarella and ricotta, on thin crust. delicious! \n\nglad i don't live in the area... because all i'd want to eat is their pizza!"

            "we strolled in a little late looking for a small bite to eat and we stumbled into happy hour.  shani was fantastic and informative.  she told us to try the <mark>Cal Italia</mark>.  i was a little hesitant because of the figs but she talked it up so much we had to try it.  this pizza is incredible and i don't just say that being a guy from new jersey!  the manager ricky stopped over to see how we were doing and i was amazed by his passion and knowledge for this business.  i am also in the customer service industry and i love to see someone that is driven by customer satisfaction.  he told us about the history of pizza rock and this pizza surely does!!  i will be back.",

            "before anything else, let me just state that i hate driving to downtown lv because i have no patience to parallel park my yacht, i'm too cheap to pay for parking and there's always some crazy/drunk person crossing the street when they're not supposed to tempting me to run them over.    \n\n/endrant\n\ni read on a review to park in dt garage 3 - well, i didn't do that. you can also parallel park in front of the restaurant or across the street - i didn't do that either. i parked at binion's which is a short walk from pizza rock. i was told that the dt garage is a mess anyway. i had no clue where i needed to walk after parking my car so i followed a showgirl wearing sparkly stuff and feathers. she was walking towards the opposite direction - i was late for dinner but i got pics of her nice cheeks!\n\n/endshenanigans\n\nthe place is filled with tv's so you can watch sports. there's a big rig coming out of the wall. sheet metal with a heart, spade, club, diamond cut out on the ceiling. i got a chimay...3/4 of it since 1/4 of it ended up on the table when it was put in front of me. they were giving me a grapefruit drink which i apparently ordered and not a chimay. i hate grapefruit so let me go ahead and order me a grapefruit drink because that makes sense!\n\ni was looking forward to trying their truffle fries/ rosemary garlic fries and <mark>Cal Italia</mark> pizza. so we get those plus meatballs and margherita pizza. kacey informed us that this is the same as tony's pizza napoletana in san francisco. she was right. same menu and everything. we were debating whether or no we should get a sicilian pizza but it's $30...for a pizza? what?\n\ntruffle fries:\nfries were crispy inside and out. truffle flavor was not noticeable. they drizzled a little bit of truffle oil, i only saw a few tiny specks of black truffles on these fries. flavor was definitely lacking. 2/5\n\nrosemary garlic fries:\nthe rosemary taste was strong. i was hoping for more garlic flavor instead of grossmary. 2.5/5\n\nmeatballs:\n6 tender smelly balls. smelly because of the cheese probably. they were ok. 3.5/5\n\nmargherita pizza:\ngreat crisp chewy crust. real tomatoes, mozzarella cheese and basil. a pizza for the purists. 4/5\n\n<mark>Cal Italia</mark>:\nmario and luigi did not approve of the <mark>Cal Italia</mark>. this california-inspired pizza was a food network gold medal winner if it matters to anyone. it has gorgonzola, asiago, mozzarella, sweet fig preserve, prosciutto di parma, parmiggiano-reggiano and <mark>Balsamic Reduction</mark>. sweet and salty...not for the purists. i enjoyed this bastardized pizza. 5/5\n\nwe got a 20% discount for being locals. their happy hour starts at 10pm and some menu items go for $3, $5 and $7. service was not the best but it wasn't horrible. pizzas were good but skip the fries. so, overall, this place deserves 3.5 stars.\n\nshortly after posting my review, i got a message from one of the owners and he said:\n\n\"would like to send you some additional info on pizza rock:\n- free valet parking is available for pizza rock directly across the street at the downtown grand casino.\n- the sicilian pizza is a large format pizza and generally serves 3 people, hence the $30 price tag.\"\n\nso there! now you know.", 
            "have you ever thought to yourself, \"i really wish i could pay $17 for a 12 inch, undercooked pizza at a rock and roll themed restaurant that looks like a semi truck ran through the walls!\"??? then boy, do i have a place for you!! so, maybe that was a loaded intro, but i'll make up for it by keeping this short and sweet. \n\nwe ordered the 6 meatballs, truffle fries, rosemary garlic fries, a margherita pizza and a <mark>Cal Italia</mark> pizza. \n\n<mark>The Butcher 'All Meat'</mark> had zero flavor to them and were mighty dry. the sauce was passable. not only could i have made better meatballs, but that one aunt everyone has who cooks terrible food and brings it during your family gatherings could have out shined these meatballs with her eyes closed. \n\nthe fries were an embarrassment. like, think cheap bargain basement u.s. foods quality fries with barely any flavor added to them. it's a pizzeria and they weren't too outrageous at $6, so i won't hold that one too much against them. \n\nthe pizza we ordered was the trendy napoletana style small undercooked pizza. it was ok. not $16 ok, but ok. i should really have tried the new york style, but that will be saved for another time. those are $20+ a piece. and should you want a sicilian, they offer them here, but for $30+ for a rectangle. apparently you can get away with charging these prices in downtown las vegas. at somewhere like new york pizza & pasta, you pay $17 to start, and it fills the entire square of the 16\" pizza box. i didn't try the other pie as the toppings didn't do it for me. \n\nthe server was friendly. though, a pet peeve of mine is when a pizzeria doesn't automatically bring out parmesan and red pepper. it should either be on the table right away or served with the pizza. that's pizza 101, guys. thankfully, the drinks weren't too nuts. my jack and coke was like $7. they also offer a 20% discount for locals, so i suppose those two things ease the highway robbery a bit. there are tv's everywhere and the place is spacious. so, the highlight of my experience was that there were tvs and i wasn't crammed in around other people... it's downtown, where it's trendy to overpay for subpar items and deal with inconvenient parking. not sure i'll return, unless i'm in the area and starving. if i do, i'll try a ny style and skip <mark>The Butcher 'All Meat'</mark> and fries. you probably should too.", 
            "i've now been to pizza rock twice. first things first, why not 5 stars? basically because i've been here twice and i have never been told that locals receive 20% off their bill. what the heck pizza rock? i don't typically go around asking, hey can i get a local discount? but. when i've been here twice and sung its praises to people - and yet, i've been able to get 20% off but haven't? arg. that ruffles my feathers.\n\non to what is good. happy hour is awesome. personal pizzas, apps, well drinks, and cocktails all on the cheap. my friends and i came here during hh and split all three of the personal pizzas and shared <mark>The Butcher 'All Meat'</mark>. okay. i'm no meatball expert but i think these are delicious. meaty, not bready, and the sauce it comes with compliments very well. i also like that these meatballs are simple. i've had way too many meatballs that have way too much going on with them. another reason i like them: you can cut them down the middle with your fork and they fall away in two pieces, not a bunch of lumpy, gross meat pieces. quality. i think.\n\nother than hh.... i came here with my hubby on a saturday night. luckily they have plenty of 2-top tables so we were seated quickly. service was quick and to the point. our server neither impressed me or upset me so i'll give a neutral rating for service.\n\nwhat we ordered... the <mark>New Yorker</mark> 23. it was the one pizza on the menu i figured my picky (and rather plain-jane) husband would enjoy. the <mark>New Yorker</mark> comes with: sliced mozzarella, <mark><mark>Tomato Sauce</mark></mark>, sliced house link sausage, garlic, pepperoni, ricotta. i asked for the link sausages to be removed and replaced with mushrooms. they were happy to oblige. under the menu it says, \"winner, best traditional, las vegas\". i'm not sure what that means.\n\noverall thoughts on the pizza... i enjoyed it. i love the thin crust style. the mix of cheese and sauce was perfect. pepperoni... okay. the ricotta cheese was an awesome addition, creamy and slightly sweet offsetting the heartiness of the pepperoni <mark>Clam and Garlic</mark>. the flavors were that of a \"normal\" pizza, but with a refinement. i think this was a perfect way to satisfy my more adventurous side and my husband's more traditional side.\n\nfinal decision: mine and my husband's dinner was a bit pricey. although delicious, i would rather go back for the happy hour. hh is your best bet here. and ya, go ahead and throw in the fact you're a local. you'll probably get a discount, unlike me. i'd also be interested in just heading up to the take out window to take a slice to go.\n\nother things i want to go back for:\n\ntheir margherita (only 73 made per day)\n<mark>Clam and Garlic</mark> pizza\n<mark>La Regina</mark> (the gold cup winner)\n<mark>Quail Egg White Rose Potato Guanciale</mark> pizza\n<mark>Cal Italia</mark> (again, this comes as one of the personal pizzas on hh menu and is a foodnetwork winner)\nthe chorizo mussels (app)\nand i would come back again for <mark>The Butcher 'All Meat'</mark>.\n\nlooks, like i'll be making a few return trips. the great thing is, i am so happy there is a good, inventive pizza place so close to where i live now.",

            "i kept hearing about this tony guy and his award winning pizzas, i was excited to try a new pizzeria that was getting so much buzz. \n\ngoal was to try one pizza from each of the ovens.\n\nnapoletana - 900 degree wood stefano ferrara. we went with the margherita. this was pretty standard, nothing stood out, i felt it was served a bit cold as well, although michael made a good point, it couldn't been from the photo ops.\n\npizza romana - electric brick oven 700 degrees. we chose the romana iii. it's 3 pizzas in 1. 1/3 was gorgonzola, dates & pecans, <mark>Apples, Honey, Nutella</mark> (this was my favorite) 1/3 was <mark>Sweet Fig Preserves</mark>, prosciutto, gorgonzola, <mark>Balsamic Reduction</mark> (this was my second favorite) and the other portion was ricotta, garlic, basil, linguisa, <mark>Piquante Peppers</mark>. this was a nice option if you have lots of people in your party, you can a piece of each.\n\nclassic italian - gas brick oven 650 degrees. we chose the <mark>Cal Italia</mark>. this was the gold medal winner on the food network, and the winner for jaime w and i. i liked how all the ingredients came together.\n\ncalifornia - 900 degree wood fire oven. we chose the <mark>Quail Egg White Rose Potato Guanciale</mark>. this had a kick, spicy! this was my least favorite of the pizzas, not a fan of eggs on my pizza, but at least i can say i gave it a try. \n\nwe then sampled the <mark>Farmers Market</mark> pizza, weekly special using ingredients from downtown <mark>Farmers Market</mark>, this week it was pumpkin, brown sugar, cinnamon, bacon and topped with dollops of marshmallow. didn't really do anything for me. \n\ndessert, yes we still had room for dessert. <mark>Mud Pie</mark>, <mark>Pecan Turnover</mark> and desert calzone. nothing really excited me. it was all pretty standard. \n\noverall, i wasn't in love with this place. nothing was that spectacular that would make me drive to downtown and attempt to find parking. save this place for the tourists.", 
            "this post is overdue, but then again, when am i not behind? a couple weeks ago, we went downtown to try pizza rock. it's owned by tony gemignani you might know him from bar rescue. we also know of him because of his restaurant is san francisco, tonys pizza napoletana. upon returning from our recent trip, i checked to see how the menus compare... they're practically identical. that meant those delicious meatballs could be had right here at home. we only hoped they were just as good. \n\nmy brother joined us and we got there in time for happy hour (mon-fri 3-6; sun-thur 10-close). beers, appetizers and pizzas are discounted (local's discount does not apply). they have a great craft beer selection ($5) so they hooked me on that alone. we each ordered meatballs ($3). <mark>The Butcher 'All Meat'</mark> itself was just as good as those in san francisco, but the sauce was too acidic. hopefully, the kitchen is still tweaking the recipe. still, we enjoyed them. we shared an order of garlic bread ($5). very <mark>Garlic</mark>, but otherwise unmemorable. \n\nwe each ordered a personal pizza from the happy hour menu. this was a great savings and a way to try pizzas we typically wouldn't order. <mark>Frank's True Italian (Thin Crust)</mark> ($7) had pesto garlic and it was topped with mozzarella and <mark><mark>Cherry Tomato</mark></mark>. this was our favorite of the three. \n \nthe pepperoni had some kick ($5) but it was the least liked crust and <mark>Cal Italia</mark> ($7) was too sweet for my liking; it seemed like dessert. however, it came highly recommended from our server and it has won awards. it has sweet fig preserve and topped with mozzarella, gorgonzola, and prosciutto. \n\npizzas i've had at tony's have been far more impressive so next time i'll stick to the regular menu for pizza, but i'll definitely enjoy those $3 meatballs and $5 craft beers again.", 
            "this place is absolutely amazing!!!! from the minute we walked in we were greeted by two very friendly girls. we even had a small dance party with them making our 10 min wait fly by with fun. never have i been treated this way by any restaurant, you guys are doing it right with those two up there.  they were exactly right, waiting on a perfect big booth to accommodate our party of 8.  the place smells amazing the minute you hit the door.  after being seated we were immediately greeted by our server kathleen .  i will definitely request her every return. drinks came out fast, our order was perfect, & she also seemed like a real person(not a scripted robot). i don't know how people on here have complained about <mark>The Butcher 'All Meat'</mark>.. these things are bomb!!! definitely a must try & especially for the price!! we ordered a few different pizzas. new york 22\" was so delicious and plenty to feed most of us.  we also tried the <mark>Cal Italia</mark>. my favorite pizza by far!!! if i was with only a couple friends this would be our #1 choice, just wish the size was larger. also tried the romana ii. omg 3 delicious pizzas all in one! great choice if you are very indecisive like me!! overall i loved this place! excellent atmosphere for the younger crowd! i'm already planning my next bday party! while i was there they were also accommodating two massive parties and still making room for the rest of us! five stars hands down! everything from the front of the house to the back! pizza rock...you guys rock!!!!", 
            "i won't lie - i was skeptical.  how can one place make so many different styles of pizza and make them all well?  \n\nwell, this place has come pretty darn close to achieving that goal.  we had the margherita, <mark>Cal Italia</mark> (proscuitto, fig, balsamic), and <mark>La Regina</mark> (sicilian with picante, mozz, arugula).  notice all the ones we ordered had won some kind of award.  i'm used to margherita not having sauce, this one had sauce on it - but it was delish!  the sauce was slightly acidic and not sweet, which i really enjoyed.  the crust was perfect, just wish the mozz was more spectacular.  the <mark>Cal Italia</mark> had a nice blend of savory and sweet flavors as well as amazing crust.  the <mark>La Regina</mark> was my least favorite, the toppings were a little sparse and i've had better crust. \n\ncool interior, awesome service.  i must be getting elderly as i was complaining to my tablemates about how loud the music was....  but even though i was screaming they couldn't hear me.  not the place for a first date.  get ready to use sign language and stare at the person across/next to you eat while you listen to 80s british and american rock.  music videos included.  \n\ntip: parking is a pain.  just valet it right outside the restaurant at the hotel across the way.  you will probably end up paying the same amount anyway but won't have to walk a block.", 
            "this place is perfect for the group of people who each want a different style of pizza. thin, new york, sicilian, whatever... they'll have it plus different electric and wood ovens to boot. their extensive menu can be overwhelming for those that are indecisive, like me. so, it's best to peruse the menu ahead of time or just let someone else order. the <mark>Cal Italia</mark> ($18) was the best pizza i tried with its rich flavors from the sweetness of the figs to the savoriness of the prociutto. i also enjoyed the <mark>Quail Egg White Rose Potato Guanciale</mark> ($18) even though i'm typically not crazy about spicy foods. the roma iii ($32) is great if you're in the mood for an appetizer, entree, and dessert pie all in one. although the middle section with the <mark>White Cream Sauce</mark> <mark>Spaghetti and Meatballs</mark> was the main standout for me. not so impressive were the margherita ($16) and farmer's market (pumpkin puree, cinnamon, marshmallow). our group even had room for dessert. the <mark>Pecan Turnover</mark> and apple calzone more than satisfied my sweet tooth. the <mark>Mud Pie</mark>, after chiseling away at it, was a letdown. it only succeeded in making me feel guilty for consuming all those calories. so, while dishes were hit or miss, there's enough promise to warrant a return visit.\n\n3.5 stars",

            "fell in love with tony and his food at his restaurant (tony's) at graton casino in rohnert park, ca.  was so thrilled to find out that at the same time tony's was opening at graton, pizza rock was also opening up in vegas.  his meatballs and marinara are perfect little morsels, and the marinara with just enough tang and sweetness to it i could eat it by itself.  the <mark>Cal Italia</mark> is a must, as well as the diavolo.  however, i like my crust a little bit more on the thin side, so i go with the romana selections (pepperoni with arugula is pretty amazing).  the various crusts and cooking styles, as well as 3 different pizza ovens can accommodate pretty much any palette.  getting to tony's is easy peasy as well.  just valet park at the grand, walk through the casino and step out onto 3rd where tony's, hog & heifers, and triple george grill are right across the street.  and if you don't want to sit down for full service, tony's serves up slices right up front.  cannot go wrong here.  sports, music, videos, great bar and perfect food.  oh, and locals get a 15% discount if they show their id at bill time.", 
            "i'm a huge fan of tony gemingani so it was only a matter of time, with me being a frequent visitor to vegas, that i would visit pizza rock over in downtown vegas. \n\nthe menu is virtually the same from tony's pizza napolitana in sf.  it includes his famous award winning margherita which is cooked in under 2 minutes along with his vast assortment of pizzas from ny style, romana, california style, and gluten-free.  and it also includes his famous meatballs and pasta dishes as well.  don't forget to check out his burgers too.\n\nsame menu, different setting and in this case, a very different setting where instead of the traditional italian restaurant look from tony's in sf, it's more of a heavy metal rock theme inside here which is quite fitting for vegas actually.  that being said, the pizza is really top notch.  and although i've been to tony's in sf a few times, there are still a lot of things on the menu that i still haven't tried.  my friends and i decided on their <mark>Cal Italia</mark> and the <mark>Honey Pie</mark>.\n\n<mark>Cal Italia</mark> -- http://bit.ly/1bgftsf\ngold medal winner - food network pizza champions challenge\nasiago, mozzarella, imported gorgonzola, sweet fig preserve, prosciutto di parma, \nparmigiano-reggiano, <mark>Balsamic Reduction</mark> \nalthough i've been to tony's three times, this is actually my first time trying his prize winning <mark>Cal Italia</mark>.  it's a very interesting pie in both looks and flavor.  very sweet and savory from the figs and balsamic and prosciutto.  i really dug this pie and would definitely order it again next time i come back to either here or at tony's in sf.\n\n<mark>Honey Pie</mark> -- http://bit.ly/1kbvpvu\nquail hollow farm honey, calabrese peppers, <mark>Green Onions</mark>, mozzarella, piave cheese, \nfried <mark><mark>Caramelized Onions</mark></mark>, serrano peppers\ni've had this pie before at tony's in sf and i ordered it again to share with my friends in vegas so they can try it for the first time.  it's a very unusual pie that has a very sweet and savory flavor with a little spicy kick to it.  if you've ever had a deep fried wonton at a chinese restaurant and dip it in sweet and sour sauce, that's probably the most similar taste that i can compare this pizza to.  although the caramelized fried onions were a little burned, it still tasted delicious.  but for some reason, i wasn't tasting the honey.\n\none honorable mention i recommend from is their <mark>Burrata Burger</mark>.  i didn't have this at pizza rock but i've had it at tony's in sf.  i think it's very underrated because it's almost always overshadowed by the pizzas and everything else.  you get a 1/2 lb burger with burrata cheese and crispy prosciutto and it comes with a generous pile of parmesan garlic fries  (http://bit.ly/1epxy9t). definitely worth trying out!  \n\ni think what i like best is that the wait time at pizza rock is considerably shorter than it's older bother in sf where the wait time for a table can be at the least close to 2 hours.  though that could change if good word of mouth goes around.  it looks like pizza rock is off to a great start and with its extensive menu and popularity growing, i can see it doing very well in downtown vegas.", 
            "so its time to update my last review for pizza rock.  i must say once i posted my last yelp review  the owner, trevor responded to me immediately-within hours of the post.  he was entirely all over the issue, asking for details and assured me that all issues would be addressed which is all that i had hoped for. \n \nmy second visit was quite the opposite of my last experience and i was anticipating some kind of issues.  first off,  it was new years eve and second we had a reservation for a party of 12.  we started out with 10 people and added 2 more the day before with no problem.  when we arrived a few of us went to the bar to order a drink anticipating  to wait a little bit before being seated.  the bartender (i didn't get his name) was more than helpful and a very cool guy with corona shaped new years glasses. ;)   amazingly we were seated within 5 minutes as the other people around us were looking at over an hour wait-because they didn't have reservations.  i highly recommend the reservations-especially on a major holiday.  immediately we were greeted by our server anisa with a smile and excitement that we were there and she was ready to help us in any way possible.  i must say i was greatly surprised at the service we received with all the factors i mentioned above.  anisa was both personable and attentive that we hardly realized that she was serving other several tables.  a simple thing that makes you a super server-unfortunately not everyone can have that talent.   drinks were flowing and we all ordered with 3 or 4 split checks without any issues.  for 5 of us we ordered the <mark>New Yorker</mark> and the <mark>Cal Italia</mark> pizzas.  the <mark>New Yorker</mark> is the most amazing pizza i have ever had...that is what we ordered the last time so you know it has to be good.  it is topped with sausage and little <mark>Pepperoni</mark>....but my favorite part was the super creamy ricotta strategically placed on top where you could spread it around with your fork to savor a little on every bite.  yum.  the <mark>Cal Italia</mark> had prosciutto and a balsalmic drizzle  that had a flavor like none other.  seriously between the two pizzas we were 100% satisfied and all was gone except for one slice in the end.  not too bad for 5 people.  others ordered <mark>Spaghetti and Meatballs</mark> (it was gigantic), lasagna (which my man said he may have to order next time-it looked fabulous), the romana  ii (which gives you a little variety and its big enough to share).  everyone was very happy with their food and we left full and tipsy. =)\n\nnow we did have a small incident where one of my guests spilled a whole glass of ice water all over me.  it could have been worse right??   anisa, even though it wasn't their fault, comp'ed us a pizza just for the inconvenience which was definitely not expected by any means.  we definitely were pleased with  our server so much that we will ask for her the next time we visit.\n\nall i can say is finally some good quality food downtown.  we've been waiting a long time for some good eats out there.  you can bet that's where we will be eating while we are down there.  thank you trevor, for listening to my concerns and working out the kinks.  i believe an honorable owner is one that listens to the customer and strives to correct the issues no matter how big or small they may be.  and thanks to anisa for making our new years eve dinner a special one to remember.  happy new year pizza rock - my new years resolution is to see you often in 2014.  cheers!", 
            "i went to pizza rock on a saturday night, mainly wanting to try it after hearing about the award winning pizza. before going, i personally thought \"rock\" as a theme for a pizza restaurant marketing world cup pizzas was strange. i suppose one gets used to the typical pizza place filled with brick veneer and recreated vintage signs. pizza rock is certainly a representation of the owners personal taste. it is poorly laid out, however. you enter into a relatively dark entrance, that is juxtaposed to an overly bright take-out bar to your right. the host's stand behind wood topped tool chests with ipads hanging from them. you would not know the they were employees if they weren't behind the chests. guest waited against the walls on chairs. it was loud, like a sports bar, with the roar of the patriots colts game. \n\nwe were told it would be a 20 minute wait, they took my phone number so they could text me when our table was ready. i thought this was a cool feature, even more cool, our wait may have only been about 5 minutes. \n\nthey sat me and my girlfriend at a table for two, it was in a very unappealing space. it kind of felt floating in space, right by the busy restroom hallway, kitchen door, and main path of travel for customers to their tables. back to how it is poorly laid out, the restaurant is overly long and narrow. i did not walk the entire thing, but the seating felt unorganized with out clear paths of movement that are not distracting to guests. many times during the meal did new parties moving to their tables walk on all sides of our small for-two table, making us feel consciously swarmed for a brief moment. \n\nenough about the place, now to the meal and service. we sat down and immediately started reading the menu, their are many many options of unique pizzas complete with the temperature they cook it atm the prices seemed fair. our caesar salad may have been a little overpriced though at $10 - but it was plenty to share. \n\nwe were not immediately greeted by a server to take a drink order, probably about 5 minutes passed before we got concerned and happened to make eye contact with someone we thought might work there. again, not dressed in any uniform or some sort, we simply notice he was talking briefly to our hostess. he asked us if we had been seen and then quickly got our drink order and server. \n\nthe server was nice and adequate, he did wear a uniform, but the service was nothing exceptional, about the standard you expect in such an establishment. i will say the food did come quick after ordering it however, and the 10% locals discount is appreciated. \n\nwe ordered a caesar salad to share and the <mark>Fried Green Beans</mark> appetizer. the caesar was good, but the dressing was a bit cashier than i prefer. the <mark>Fried Green Beans</mark> were disappointing because they were not actually fried. i was looking forward to something crunchy, maybe a bit salty but they are actually saut\\u00e9ed i believe. they were still good, just not what we were lead to believe. \n\nok, the pizza. we ordered the \"<mark>Cal Italia</mark>\" (i believe it was called) it was one of the award winning pizzas. it came fast and was delicious. the crust was airy and flaky and the fig sauce drizzled on top gave a perfect sweetness to each bite. the pizza was the perfect size to share for two after an appetizer, at about 6 medium sized slices. however, once again slightly mislead. this was a sauceless pizza, although i am pretty sure the menu said \"vine ripe tomatoes sauce\".. maybe this one was a exception for the category it was under and i overlooked this detail. \n\ni give this place 3 out of 5 stars for the whole package. the facility lacking basic design logic to make the experience comfortable and inviting. this isn't a critique on the decor and theme, but the basic layout. the service was pretty standard, i think i expect a bit more from these boutique restaurants, maybe it was an off night. i'd rate the food 4 out of 5, and would like to try more items on their menu, but i'll be in no hurry to go back. \n\ni say try it when taking a night out downtown or if visiting vegas. its a casual place to bring a group of friends or family, watch the game, and get some pizza.", 
            "heard about this place and was a fan of the name. it sounds like it rocks, so had to try. dropped by in mid-afternoon and the place was nearly empty. took a seat at the bar and a nice server named ashley came over. \n\nfinding myself completely alone at the spacious, circular bar and completely unfamiliar with the menu, i threw myself at ashley's mercy. i asked what she liked. she recommended a popular pizza called the <mark>Cal Italia</mark>. it was a meat-free pizza but \"don't knock it 'till you try it,\" she told me. \n\noh, and i should mention this pizza won the food network pizza champions challenge. so honor this pizza!\n\nashley had enough charisma and steadiness to her voice that i decided to trust her. \n\ni'm glad i did. this pizza was not only a beautiful work to look upon, but was very tasty as well. tons of flavor. i'd rank it up there as one of my top five pizzas ever. seriously. loaded with asiago, mozzarella, imported gorgonzola, sweet fig preserve, prosciutto di parma, parmigiano-reggiano, and <mark>Balsamic Reduction</mark>. the combination works majestically. \n\nsee the pic i uploaded here and tell me she ain't a beaut! a swirly kind of \"optical illusion\" kinda pizza.\n\nashley noticed i didn't finish my crust. yeah i don't like to down an entire pizza and if i leave the crust i feel like i only ate half. \n\ntry this place out. full bar, tables, and a counter. \n\npizza rock rocks!", 
            "i have been here 4 times and each time the food has been excellent. every time they have honored the 15% off your bill for checking in, and on one occasion our server provided free meatball appetizer bc we were locals! the spicy calamari is the best calamari i've ever had and you get a huge portion; def a great value. a friend had the <mark>Cal Italia</mark> and said it's the best pizza she's ever had. i've tried several americana and italiana and i am in love with their crust--it's perfectly done every time. i will keep going back!", 
            "tried the picante pizza and it was wonderful!!! it's an all american pizza with <mark><mark>Tomato Sauce</mark></mark>, mozzarella, garlic, linguina, peppers, serrano and banana peppers, chorizo, green onion, cholula hot sauce on rustic medium crispy crust. 5 stars for this pizza. better than secret pizza at cosmo! really! \n\nwe were debating between the margherita and <mark>Cal Italia</mark>. chose the margherita seeing the fact it won the world pizza cup in italy. we were disappointed. i guess my expectation was high on this one and we ate this after the picante. the picante was really good so i was waiting for my taste buds to be blown away for the margherita but instead we got burnt crust taste in our mounts. yes this pizza was cooked in a 900 degree wood stefano ferrera oven but not only the crust was burnt, the whole bottom of our pizza was black! i'm so sad. :( \n\nordered the truffle fries and it was hard as a rock! my 1 yr old loves fries so we got that for him but i think they over baked it. we're were looking forward to try this place based on the awesome reviews. \n\n3 overall stars for the picante pizza and the great service. we got the food to go for our ride back home to la. thank goodness for water! lol. till next time pizza rock! \n\n*thank you so much for your prompt reply in addressing my concerns, trevor. we will come back to pizza rock and try again next time we're in vegas.", 
            "<mark>Cal Italia</mark> pizza was amazing!!! and only 7$ on their happy hour menu. total 5 stars for the pizza. had the strawberry martini, phenomenal as well. will totally be back!", 
            "the <mark>Cal Italia</mark> is amazing.\n\ngreat service, friendly workers, great music, and an overall wonderful experience. \n\nthe garlic rosemary fries are the best fries i've ever had.", 
            "as suggested, we tried the <mark>Cal Italia</mark>.  it truly was worth all the recommendations.  absolutely loved the pizza and the appetizer meatballs were the perfect compliment.  cool atmosphere, great location downtown, accommodating service and food very much worth coming back for.  which we will be doing soon!", 
            "the <mark>Cal Italia</mark> pizza was absolutely amazing. the recommendations from our server were great and we enjoyed the experience immensely. we found the restaurant on a map published by mapperarti and we were intrigued by the pizza world champion who created the unique pizzas on the menu.", 
            "pizza rock, pizza rock... sigh\n\nis it weird to be in love with pizza and is it considered cheating? \n\nthere are so many things to love about your pizza let me count the ways. \n\n1. you can have up to eight different styles of pizza at a time.\n\n2. the <mark>Cal Italia</mark> and the diavola will have you at the first bite. \n\n3. calamari is sooo good and they have a spicy calamari option. seriously why doesn't everyone do this?!\n\n4. the service, music, and atmosphere are all great. \n\n5. tony gemigani has so many pizza related accolades it's ridiculous but seriously he is the u.s ambassador of neapolitan style pizza and has won multiple contests and awards for his mad skills. \n\nso if you like mediocrity, don't come here. other than that i will save you a slice at my table.", 
            "stopped by for happy hour, and a great quick meal of the <mark>Cal Italia</mark> pizza and <mark>The Butcher 'All Meat'</mark> appetizer. great food all around at great prices.", 
            "came on a friday night here for the first time and was a little confused walking in because i wasn't sure if i could just walk and sit wherever i wanted or if i needed to check in with someone. we asked and they informed us it was a 20 minute wait. we didn't wait much longer than 15 minutes and we were seated right away. \n\ni would give pizza rock a 4 on food and a 4 on service. for the first 15 minutes of us sitting we weren't sure who our server was but once we were greeted and got our order in, it was worth the 30-40 minute wait to get our food (it was really busy since it was friday). me and my bf ordered the gorgonzola fries (which were amaaaazing) and the fried artichoke (which was ok) and a gorgonzola and apple salad for starters (pretty good).  we then got the <mark>Cal Italia</mark> pizza which was really good but we had so many appetizers we saved it for a late night snack. \n\nthey also had a dj booth that was inside a truck in the dining area so that was pretty cool. the music was loud and all rock. in my opinion, it's a great place to hang out and drink! also, if you don't like dining in there's a to-go pizza area so you won't need to sit in and have your food served. patios outside as well if you're looking for some scenery outside. \n\nthanks pizza rock!", 
            "definitely my favorite pizza spot at the moment. me and my girlfriend love this place, we've tried 3 different pies but so far the <mark>Cal Italia</mark> is the favorite so far. replace the gorgonzola with <mark>Goat Cheese</mark> (unless you're a big fan of gorgonzola i guess) the pizza is a perfect mix of sweet and salty.. it's so hard to stop eating. they also carry the stiel (i think that's the brand if not it's close to that word) grapefruit beer in a bottle it's super refreshing like an alcoholic italian soda. you can also get slices up at the front if you don't feel like sitting down and waiting.. the slices up front are a little bit bigger than what you would get from a regular pie. also if you are local ask for the locals discount i think it's 15% may be 10% though, we had been there like 4 times before anyone mentioned it to us.", 
            "hands down the best pizza in vegas- and it's probably not close. it breaks the mold of gangster inspired stuffy pizza joints (prevalent in vegas) where the godfather soundtrack plays on repeat all day and every pizza comes with 35lbs of cheese on it. \n\ni had not been to pizza rock before last night. i had been to tony's in sf (another location with the same owner) so i knew how good it was going to be but somehow just never got around to it- shameful i know. it is located downtown just outside of the ruckus. it is across the street from the grand hotel and casino and you can valet park there to attend the restaurant.\n\nwe made a reservation but it didn't look like it was necessary for a sunday night. as we were being lead to our table it took every bit of restraint i could muster to not snatch slices off the many delicious looking pizzas we walked by. the decor is very orange county chopper-esque and the music is a lot of rock from the 90's which is good for the newly over 30 and old crowd. also when i checked in on yelp i got a 15% of coupon so make sure you do that. \n\nthe food\n\nwe got two pizzas since we couldn't decide. we had gotten <mark>The Butcher 'All Meat'</mark> appetizer in sf and it was great but we decided to skip it and try for dessert. \n\n<mark>Cal Italia</mark>- this was the pizza we had in sf and it has haunted us ever since. it is a white style pizza with prosciutto and <mark>Sweet Fig Preserves</mark>, sprinkled with balsamic vinegar. it sounds pretty weird i know but it is insanely good.  the pizza rock version did not disappoint. \n\n<mark>The Ogden</mark>- this had olive, <mark>Goat Cheese</mark>, <mark>House Made Honey and Calabrese Sausage</mark> on a white pizza. i know what you are thinking \"two white pizzas?\"- and yes we went there. this was not quite as good as the <mark>Cal Italia</mark>- but still good. it could of been improved by adding some more <mark>Goat Cheese</mark>- some of the pieces had quite a bit, others almost none.\n\nchicken parm- i didn't get this unfortunately- someone at the table next to me did. it looked so good i strongly considered cracking his skull open like a coconut and taking it before going on the lamb. \n\nthey have so many other unique flavors of pizza i will definitely be going back in order to try as many as possible. \n\n<mark>Mud Pie</mark>- i saw someone else get this dessert and had to get it. it comes with some awesome flavored whip cream (grand marnier?) that is sort of orange tasting- highly recommend.", 
            "this 3 star rating is for the service!!  the hostess was friendly but our waiter, matthew was slooow!!  we had to ask for drink refill and waited a long time to get them.  \n\nthe food was excellent.. we had the <mark>Pancetta & Arugula</mark> salad & the <mark>Cal Italia</mark> pizza and they were wonderful.  \n\nwould visit again.", 
            "try it.   don't expect traditional pizza as its not...but it's so good.  they have a nice happy hour while a little higher  priced on drinks then other places in the area.  but the staff is always great and friendly and the food is fabulous.   try the <mark>Cal Italia</mark> pizza.", 
            "by far, my favorite pizza place in vegas!  not only does this place have a great vibe but the food is de-lish!  definitely try the classic meat balls and the <mark>Fried Green Beans</mark> are a no-brainer.  the <mark>Cal Italia</mark> 19 is runner up to the award winning margherita - as in world pizza cup winner in italy so get both!",

            "the pizza menu was extensive with a variety of different styles. our pizza - the <mark>Cal Italia</mark> - was really spectacular. perfect for two. we also got the <mark>Beer Battered Fried Artichokes</mark>, which were delicious. you get two deep fried artichoke quarters - they looked like chicken drumsticks - and a tasty dipping sauce. the arugula salad with pancetta, mozzarella and tomatoes was good, but definitely large and a bit much. because the pizza came out before our salad, they comped it (salad) off our bill. \n\nthey had great beer selections on tap (i had a 20 oz. dogfish head 90 minute and hubby had the deschutes fresh squeezed ipa)  and a great happy hour (we weren't there for that though). overall the service was excellent, but the ambiance is a little... different. it's like a \"dive bar\" but it's intentional to align with the \"rock music\" theme.\n\ni would love to come back here.", 
            "wow!  loved the happy hour menu!  we had a few drinks at a great price (not watered down at all like on the strip), meatballs for an appetizer, and two individual pizzas.  all were fantastic!  i had the <mark>Cal Italia</mark> and thought it might be a bit \"foo foo\" for me...but noooo, i have been craving it ever since we left.  can't wait for a return visit to what will become one of our favorite regular stops in vegas.",

            "this is now my second run-in with pizza made (or rather associated with) tony gemignani. he's well known in san francisco for being a world pizza champion and owner of tony's pizza napoletana. my first experience consisted of a long wait, which was all i could recall. i guess the pizza was less than memorable. \n\na local b-list celebrity chef opening a spruced up rock-themed pizza joint in vegas? why do i have a feeling this is a setup for failure. it's just a feeling. first, the good. i like the concept of offering different styles of pizza made from different oven types. they are very temperature specific ranging from the hottest wood-fired oven, an electric brick oven, and down to a gas brick oven. the <mark>Cal Italia</mark>, made from the latter oven was a winner for me. it was also crowned the winner of the food network pizza champions challenge. the crust was perfect - lightly crispy on top with a mostly chewy consistency. the sweet fig preserve and <mark>Balsamic Reduction</mark> paired with the prosciutto and parmigiano-reggiano was a home run. \n\nthe bad. the menu is way too large. i tried the <mark>Burrata Burger</mark>, which was awfully salty with the bacon mixed into the patty. i could barely taste any of the burrata due to the over seasoning. <mark>The Butcher 'All Meat'</mark> and truffle fries were average.\n\nthe ugly. the margherita, the supposed world pizza cup winner, was burnt to the point where we had to ask the waitress to return it. i know my pizza and the occasional blistering of the crust, but this was beyond that. it was black all around as well as burnt black flour underneath. all i could taste was the bitterness of the charred crust and of regret. a wood fire pizza cannot sit in a 900 degree oven very long. the saving grace was a very apologetic and helpful waitress. \n\ni like the large space and the fact that there's a big rig in the middle of the restaurant, but the atmosphere cannot entice me to return. for a city that prides itself on offering free parking in most places, the downtown parking situation was abysmal. street parking was minimal and most of the offerings around pizza rock were at one of the local hotels that offered valet (free only with validation). oh, i also happened to use the restroom before leaving and witnessed a guy vomiting and retching profusely in the stall next to me. to be fair, i cannot say if it was from the food or the alcohol. let's just leave it at that.", 
            "yum! i love pizza rock! definitely one of my favorite pizza places.\n\nthe restaurant's atmosphere is cool - they have tvs everywhere and are usually playing awesome music + music videos. my only complaint would be that the music can be too loud sometimes, making it hard to talk to whoever you're with. but when you're munching on some of the best pizza, who has time to talk? \n\ni always intend to try more of their pizzas, but i can't ever pull myself away from the <mark>Cal Italia</mark>. it is so delicious! we also always get an order of meatballs. they're super tender and the sauce is great. \n\nthe sangria is also pretty freakin' good. \n\nno complaints about their service. even when we've come in and they were super busy, the staff has always been attentive and friendly.", 
            "how deceiving is the decor in this place? \n\npizza rock on the inside gives off the guy fieri/ affliction look. over-the-top designs and trying really hard to be the cool \"rock-n-roll\" type place to eat pizza. i didn't really notice that much \"rocking\" decor except for in the bathroom, where an airbrushed jimi hendrix face stares at you while you do your business. don't forget the giant semi truck with killer flames on it placed in the middle of the restaurant. nothing says, \"rock-n-roll\" like a truck with flames bro.  \n\nthat being said, the food here was actually very good. i arrived right before happy hour was ending and the bartender was cool enough to get in my food and double my beer order so i could get the happy hour prices. great customer service move, plus she never rushed me and even gave pizza suggestions while i hungrily stared at the large menu. \"i'll have the <mark>Cal Italia</mark> personal pizza and the dogfish head 90 minute ipa\". mmmm, ipa. \n\nalong with my order, i also got a caesar salad which was pretty basic minus the anchovies laid on top, yikes! not my idea of appetizing, but \"when in rome\" or \"pizza rock\" do as they do?...naw...these were promptly picked off and placed on the side. the salad was very large and could easily have been a meal all on it's own or shared. crisp lettuce, shaved parmesan, <mark>Clam and Garlic</mark> croutons, great foodie starting point. the pizzai i ordered, the <mark>Cal Italia</mark>, is an award winning pie according to their menu, in fact it's a gold medal winner from the food network pizza champions challenge. how's that for a stamp of approval!\n\nthis pizza was very tasty from the three different types of cheeses, <mark>Balsamic Reduction</mark>, and <mark>Sweet Fig Preserves</mark>. this crazy combination only got more delightful with the addition of thinly sliced prosciutto di parma, b-o-m-b. there were only four slices of this pizza, but i could have easily eaten eight. the beer just complimented my eating experience, thank goodness i had two in front of me. \n\nthe guy fieri style decor might turn-off your hunger, but as the old saying goes, \"don't judge a book by its cover, only by how tasty its pages are\". i might have made that last part up.", 
            "went here on a friday night with a group of 6 friends after very briefly doing the fremont-tourist-thing. i had been dying to give this place a try since, after living in chicago for 5 years, vegas pizza had sucked balls, on the whole. \n\nwe ordered the <mark>Cal Italia</mark>, and the <mark>Old Chicago</mark>, because fuck yes chicago cracker crust. we also ordered a third pizza that never showed, but was only briefly missed. the other two were so wonderful...i almost don't have anything to say because, yeah, perfect pizza. perfect. crust, perfect. sauces, perfect. balance, ridiculously perfect. ugh, i want some right now.\n\nwaitress was awesome; attentive, informative, helpful, and not hovering, and the place was packed, so i do not hold the missing pie (which we were never charged for, either) against anyone. super kind to one of my tourist friends, whose accent makes her pronunciation of things like \"prosciutto\" a source of embarrassment quite often. we felt utterly welcome and had a truly happiness-enducing meal.\n\n my only gripe was the noise level, which was pitched just above \"easy conversation\" range. that's to be expected at fremont on a friday, but not my bag. will try it on a different night to see if the levels change.\n\nit's a little on the pricey side for pizza, but i find i really don't care. it's so good i am happy to pay a little bit extra for pizza i truly enjoy. i will just go all rhett butler on my budget and remind it i don't give a damn. it's cheap for actually sating the great pizza itch. \n\nmy favorite pizza in vegas, so far by miles. that cracker crust. yessss. will be back as soon and as often as i can manage.", 
            "had the opportunity to visit this fine establishment on two occasions during a recent trip to the big lv.  both visits proved to be satisfying. the first visit was at about 11pm on a wednesday night after a few hours taking in the public spectacle that is the freemont street experience.  we were looking for something quick and easy. that is precisely what we got. they sell by the slice all day, but at that point in the evening, you get what you get & you don't throw a fit.   but what we got was a nice thin crust with plenty of yummy toppings.  \nour second visit was a dinner party with approximately 35 people. there were multiple pizzas ordered, so i tried three. the pizza that stood out for me is their <mark>Cal Italia</mark> (i now know this is a gold medal winner on the food network pizza challenge). oh my!!  if you go - you must try a slice of this one.\nonly reason i didn't give a 5-star rating is because the service for our big group was a bit lack luster. we waited too long for drinks & refill. the food, however, is 5-stars all the way.", 
            "the skinny: awesome happy hour however the regular dinner items were only okay (3.5) service: pretty good for a pizza joint although it wasn't particularly busy when we went (4) value: amazing happy hour for the price while regular dining is a bit pricey for what it is (3.5 round up to a 4 starred review).\n\nnote about the parking: do not go inside the casino for validated parking. just park in the the grand self-parking lot across the street and the hostess at pizza rock will give you a sticker to put on your parking ticket for free parking. score!\n\nafter visiting twice, i have decided i do like pizza rock.\n\nthe first visit for dinner, i wasn't terribly impressed. we ordered the <mark>Old Chicago</mark> cracker thin crust pizza and a <mark>House Salad</mark>. \n\nthe <mark>Old Chicago</mark> pizza was okay but nothing i needed to order again. specifically, the crust is very burnt on the edges of the pizza which was off-putting. although the sausage/pepperoni/ricotta cheese combination was good, the pizza felt that it was missing something... like a hit of mushroom to kind of unify all the flavors. it was a bit greasy as well.\n\nthe <mark>House Salad</mark> is rather small with a very generic tasting balsamic dressing on top. for $6, i'd pass on this.\n\nenticed by the happy hour prices, we decided hit this joint again. we ordered the personal pizza sized molinari and the <mark>Cal Italia</mark> for $7 each and tried the <mark>Fried Green Beans</mark> for $3 and fried calamari for $5.\n\nthe <mark>Fried Green Beans</mark> were pretty good. they are not fried per se but sauteed lightly with a lot of garlic. for those who are watching their waistlines, the amount of oil on the bottom of the bowl is intimidating however. for $3, the serving size is quite generous.\n\nthe fried calamari was delicious! the calamari was soft and tender while the breading was appropriately on the lighter side. portion size was rather large. you can get this dish in either the spicy version/non-spicy version or even half and half. personally, i found the spicy version to be a little too strong for my tastes so i'll stick to the regular version.\n\nthe pizza crust was very good - slightly chewy with a nice crispy bottom which was a good change from the burnt crust on their ol' chicago.\n\nfor me, the <mark>Cal Italia</mark> was only okay - a bit too sweet due to the figs and <mark>Balsamic Reduction</mark> and needs a bit more of the gorgonzola and proscuitto to balance things out. i almost wished they hadn't reduced the balsamic vinegar to retain a bit more of the acidity to the dish.\n\nthe molinari was a great old school pizza - it's basically what they call everybody's favourite back home in canada (sausage and mushroom). the crust and sauce was great and everything just went well together. some may think that it is a little greasy (which it is - no doubt) but that comes with the territory when you serve  3 types of sausage on a pizza. so good and totally guilty pleasure.\n\noverall, this joint has a lot going for it - the variety on the menu is good and the happy hour deals are excellent. although some of the items are hit or miss, the molinari and fried calamari will have me coming back for sure. service is good if you are going during off peak hours/days (we went happy hour during the week and sunday evening at 5:30pm). overall 3.5 starred review with a bump up to 4.", 
            "so i read an article about pizza rock, in one of the magazines that is in the seat back pocket on the airplane. the article made it sound pretty good so we read some reviews on yelp and decided to give it a try. this place, pardon the pun, rocks!\n\nfirst off, the location is only one block off of freemont street, on third street, an easy walk from all of the freemont street action.\n\nthe place has a really cool grunge, rock bar feel, yet it is appropriate for all ages. our 11 year old and 19 year old both really liked the place, especially the good music/video mix they have playing.\n\nwe visited pizza rock twice while we were in vegas. visit #1 was so good, we had to go back for more a few days later.\n\nvisit #1 - i can't remember the server's name, but she was awesome. her recommendations were spot on and our drinks were always full. we ordered the <mark>Cal Italia</mark> pizza which is a sauceless pizza with asiago, mozzarella, gorgonzola, fig preserve, prosciutto, and <mark>Balsamic Reduction</mark>. it was amazing. one of the best pizzas we've ever had. my 11 year old had the margherita and it was very similar to the margherita pizzas you find in rome. we finished lunch with a tiramisu and it was extraordinary! the best i have ever had!\n\nvisit #2 - the second time we came to the restaurant was a saturday around 10 pm and it was significantly busier than our visit a few days earlier, at lunch. this time we had the <mark>New Yorker</mark>, which was good, but it did have too much garlic and the ricotta gave the pizza an odd taste. if you are a garlic and ricotta fan, you will like it, me not so much. we also ordered <mark>Frank's True Italian (Thin Crust)</mark>, which is a pesto pizza similar to the style you find at grimaldi's, it was very good.\n\nlong story short, this place is a top notch pizza joint and it deserves all of the awards it has won. my favorite pizza place in nevada, bar none.", 
            "we've been dying to try this place out and we finally got around to it with two good friends. \n\nnone of us have been here before so we were ready to dig into some pizza or \"za\" as my boyfriend would call it. \n\nwe all ordered a round of blue moons and each shared two pizzas. my boyfriend and i got the <mark>Cal Italia</mark> which had challenge asiago, mozzarella, imported gorgonzola, sweet fig preserve, prosciutto di parma, parmigiano-reggiano, <mark>Balsamic Reduction</mark>. after our first bite, our tastebuds were roaring, it was delicious and a must try! \n\nwe also tried <mark>Old Chicago</mark>, which was very thin crust with <mark><mark>Tomato Sauce</mark></mark> mozzarella, provolone, sliced \nmeatballs, garlic, ricotta, romano, oregano. this one was okay, but we much rather had more of the <mark>Cal Italia</mark>! \n\noverall, pizza rock gets four thumbs up from us!",

            "i have a hard time finding good pizza in vegas and so far i have only found 2 places i love everything about their pizza at and this on my top 2. \n\n<mark>Calamari Fritti</mark>* 13\ntraditional or calabrese style with \ncalabrese aioli and marinara dipping sauces\n\ngreat dipping sauces and good calamari. pricey for an appetizer. \n\n<mark>Beer Battered Fried Artichokes</mark> 8.5\nwith calabrese aioli\n\nhmm wish it had more than 2 pieces, this was delicious!\n\n<mark>New Yorker</mark> 23\nwinner, best traditional in the world, vegas\nsliced mozzarella, <mark><mark>Tomato Sauce</mark></mark>, sliced house link sausage, \ngarlic, pepperoni, ricotta\n\nthe ricotta was not how i usually see ricotta on a pizza. this was whipped and light and i can't say i was a huge fan of it, but as you can see i still give the place 4 stars. if the ricotta was not whipped and so soft, i would have liked it thicker if that makes sense. it would have been absolute perfection of a pizza! \n\nthe pepperoni was top notch, and this is coming from someone who hates pepperoni. i never get pepperoni on pizza. it was small, crispy, and tasty. although a bit greasy, nowhere near what i think of when i think of pepperoni. i am just glad i tried what real pepperoni should be and now i can't say i hate pepperoni. sausage, i would never ever choose sausage on a pizza but i was with my friend and hubby and majority rules. well, this sausage was really good. i rarely ever say that about sausage or any meat on my pizza. the combinations of flavors on this pizza was perfect. the toppings were spread out perfectly getting a bite of almost everything in each bite. the dough was perfect and cooked to perfection, also tasted good and i ate the crust. this pizza dough was exactly the pizza i like. \n\nthe service was very good for being as crowded as they were. i was actually surprised by the good service we got with that many people in the restaurant.  our waiter was so friendly and came around just the right amount of times. i did not need to hunt him down for more water, and he did not come often enough that it was annoying. \n\ni was expecting rock music since they are called pizza rock, but i did not hear rock music. i heard music that reminded me of skating at the skating rink in junior high. i enjoyed it, but it was really really really loud. i could not hear my friend who was sitting right in front of me. \n\none of their downfalls for me is their location. it works for them though and i am sure brings the great business. i am just being selfish and prefer to go to restaurants not on the strip or not in downtown.  the wait was a one hour wait (i hate waiting for food) and they were extremely packed! i saw bachelorette parties, wedding parties, large parties, and all kinds of interesting people (people who looked dressed up for a marathon, literally ran the marathon then came in for pizza? love that). it was a tourist crowd for sure. parking is a bit of pain coming from someone who got spoiled by vegas' easy parking. but, it won't stop me from coming, it just is more of a \"hassle\" being in downtown area near fremont. i wish they would open one in downtown summerlin *hint hint*. \n\nall of their pizzas look amazing and i can't wait to try the prosciutto and pear, <mark>Clam and Garlic</mark> (brings back childhood memories of clam pizza on venice beach-i have not had clam pizza since and would love to try theirs), <mark>Cal Italia</mark>, and more. \n\n-1 star only because music was too loud, waits are long, ricotta was weird to me, and a bit pricey. it won't stop me from coming back because i really enjoyed the majority of everything in this restaurant, specifically the pizza. \n\ni did get a yelp check in offer and was very happy about that!!", 
            "ate here last night with a group and ordered the <mark>Cal Italia</mark>. if you love excessive cheese on your pizza this is a good go to. otherwise the balance of sweet and salty for most is off owing to the overwhelming cheese. service too was also disappointing as the waiter would sprint by asking if we needed anything. the two stars are for the ambiance which is fun and upbeat and loud.", 
            "i ate dinner at pizza rock in las vegas, nv on 9/15/2015.  it was my 2nd time there.  this time my cruise friends miriam & jeff (who live in las vegas) met me there.  lisa, our server, recommended the <mark>Cal Italia</mark> pizza.  it was a good suggestion.  my <mark>Cal Italia</mark> pizza was $19.00 and my root beer was $3.00.  good food and good service.  plus, i took photos.", 
            "my mom and i just came into town today. we heard about this place and wanted to try it. not a disappointment. this place is amazing! our pizza(the <mark>Cal Italia</mark>) was so good and our waitress was very sweet. she came back multiple times to check if everything was alright. when i come back to vegas this will definitely be on my list of places to eat at.", 
            "sort of a darker version of hard rock cafe. music videos are playing all around. we enjoyed the atmosphere. our waitress was great. very nice and kept checking in on us. the pizza we had was one of the best pizza i have had. we had the <mark>Cal Italia</mark> pizza...wow amazing. definitely we will be back. i highly recommend this place!", 
            "my group of friends and i really lucked out with the timing of our arrival at pizza rock the other night.  the monday night football game had just started and pizza rock was less than 10 minutes away from ending happy hour.  $3 32-oz pbrs and appetizers, $5 garlic bread, and $7 individual specialty pizzas.  we asked the waitress to make sure she was back before happy hour ended and we quickly put together an order of a ton of appetizers to share as well as pbrs and individual pizzas for the group.  \n\nfor appetizers i tried the <mark>Fried Green Beans</mark>, garlic bread, <mark>Spaghetti and Meatballs</mark>.  for my pizza i had the <mark>Cal Italia</mark> which apparently won the food network pizza champions challenge.  they won't get any argument from me on that distinction; it was well deserved.  all of their food was incredible, and i really wish i had more time in vegas to try more of their menu.  i can't wait to go back; pizza rock will definitely be a must stop when i do."

            "stopped in here for a late lunch after a visit to the mob museum. the waiter was attentive and pleasant and the menu was varied. i didn't see a build-your-own pizza option, which would have been nice. we had <mark>The Vedura (Veggie)</mark> pizza and the veggies on it were marinated differently. so, onions tasted one way and tomatoes tasted another. it was a bit overwhelming and very vinegary. plus there were two types of cheese on it--feta and mozzarella. not a huge fan. we also ordered the gorgonzola and apple salad which was drenched in dressing and mostly just a big bowl of salad greens. the thing that bothered me the most about this place was the dirty tables. we were surrounded by empty tables covered in dirty plates and glasses. waiters would dump dirty plates on the tables instead of just taking them into the kitchen. it took quite a while for them to be bused. maybe <mark>The Mob Boss</mark> was out that day...."

            "i'm a huge fan of tony gemingani so it was only a matter of time, with me being a frequent visitor to vegas, that i would visit pizza rock over in downtown vegas. \n\nthe menu is virtually the same from tony's pizza napolitana in sf.  it includes his famous award winning margherita which is cooked in under 2 minutes along with his vast assortment of pizzas from ny style, romana, california style, and gluten-free.  and it also includes his famous meatballs and pasta dishes as well.  don't forget to check out his burgers too.\n\nsame menu, different setting and in this case, a very different setting where instead of the traditional italian restaurant look from tony's in sf, it's more of a heavy metal rock theme inside here which is quite fitting for vegas actually.  that being said, the pizza is really top notch.  and although i've been to tony's in sf a few times, there are still a lot of things on the menu that i still haven't tried.  my friends and i decided on their <mark>Cal Italia</mark> and the <mark>Honey Pie</mark>.\n\n<mark>Cal Italia</mark> -- http://bit.ly/1bgftsf\ngold medal winner - food network pizza champions challenge\nasiago, mozzarella, imported gorgonzola, sweet fig preserve, prosciutto di parma, \nparmigiano-reggiano, <mark>Balsamic Reduction</mark> \nalthough i've been to tony's three times, this is actually my first time trying his prize winning <mark>Cal Italia</mark>.  it's a very interesting pie in both looks and flavor.  very sweet and savory from the figs and balsamic and prosciutto.  i really dug this pie and would definitely order it again next time i come back to either here or at tony's in sf.\n\n<mark>Honey Pie</mark> -- http://bit.ly/1kbvpvu\nquail hollow farm honey, calabrese peppers, <mark>Green Onions</mark>, mozzarella, piave cheese, \nfried <mark><mark>Caramelized Onions</mark></mark>, serrano peppers\ni've had this pie before at tony's in sf and i ordered it again to share with my friends in vegas so they can try it for the first time.  it's a very unusual pie that has a very sweet and savory flavor with a little spicy kick to it.  if you've ever had a deep fried wonton at a chinese restaurant and dip it in sweet and sour sauce, that's probably the most similar taste that i can compare this pizza to.  although the caramelized fried onions were a little burned, it still tasted delicious.  but for some reason, i wasn't tasting the honey.\n\none honorable mention i recommend from is their <mark>Burrata Burger</mark>.  i didn't have this at pizza rock but i've had it at tony's in sf.  i think it's very underrated because it's almost always overshadowed by the pizzas and everything else.  you get a 1/2 lb burger with burrata cheese and crispy prosciutto and it comes with a generous pile of parmesan garlic fries  (http://bit.ly/1epxy9t). definitely worth trying out!  \n\ni think what i like best is that the wait time at pizza rock is considerably shorter than it's older bother in sf where the wait time for a table can be at the least close to 2 hours.  though that could change if good word of mouth goes around.  it looks like pizza rock is off to a great start and with its extensive menu and popularity growing, i can see it doing very well in downtown vegas.", 
            "their pizza is out of this world. that's all you need to know.\n\nmy first visit was during yelp helps week and it was a great setting to try this eatery since there were so many of us, which meant that we had the opportunity to try so many different pies (of course, that also meant we were stuffed!). that night, i tried eight of their pies, a couple appetizers, desserts, and a cocktail. everything was so good that i returned just four days later with my fiance and friend hally!\n\nduring my return visit, i had to order the margherita ($16) again. the dough is hand-mixed with san felice flour and proofed in neapolitan wood boxes, then it's topped with san marzano tomatoes, mozzarella, fior di latte, basil, evoo, and <mark>Sea Salt</mark>. finally, it's baked in a 900-degree wood stefano ferrara oven. it's limited to 73 pies daily (although i heard they've gotten no where near that amount yet) and it won the world pizza cup in naples, italy. true neopolitan pizza! \n\nthe three of us also shared the downtown ($19): pepperoni, molinari salami, bacon, chives, mushrooms, red onions, bell peppers, <mark>Black Olives</mark>, <mark><mark>Extra Cheese, Pepperoni, or Italian Fennel Sausage</mark></mark>, <mark><mark>Cherry Tomato</mark></mark>; which is one of their \"american originals\" pizzas that all feature <mark><mark>Tomato Sauce</mark></mark>, mozzarella, and a rustic medium crust, baked in a gas brick oven at 550 degrees. as well as the <mark>Honey Pie</mark> ($17): quail hollow farm honey, calabrese peppers, <mark>Green Onions</mark>, mozzarella, piave cheese, fried <mark><mark>Caramelized Onions</mark></mark>, serrano peppers; one of their \"california\" pizzas that use caputo flour and baked in a 900-degree wood fire oven. \n\nthe downtown reminded me of a \"supreme/deluxe\" pizza, but definitely better. i had tried the <mark>Honey Pie</mark> during the first visit and although it wasn't one of my favorites that evening, i came to appreciate its flavors the second time around. i also tried their <mark>Classic Caesar</mark> salad ($10) and it was tasty. for drinks, i tried the strawberry fields martini ($9.50): stoli strawberry, strawberry puree and a hint of mint and hally ordered the moscow mule ($12): stoli vodka, ginger beer, and fresh squeezed lemon juice. both really delicious cocktails. \n\nfrom both visits, my favorite pizzas are the margherita, <mark>Honey Pie</mark>, and <mark>New Yorker</mark> and i absolutely loved the sweet nothing cocktail, so good. i didn't care for the <mark>Calamari Fritti</mark>, rosemary garlic fries, or the mastunicola pizza. anyway, i could eat that margherita pizza every day. it's that good. i have to keep telling myself to not order it, just so i can try their other delicious concoctions (i have my eyes on the <mark>Pizza Campari</mark>, <mark>Clam and Garlic</mark>, and proscuitto e pomodorini). hands down, definitely my favorite pizza joint now (sorry grimaldi's). but seriously, award-winning pies, five different pizza ovens, quality ingredients - you're convinced right?\n\nparking is best on the surrounding streets like on casino center blvd (meters take credit cards, yay, but you can only pay hourly at $1/hour) or free valet at the downtown grand (super easy and close). oh, and don't forget your locals discount!! win.", 
            "i've come to pizza rock several times since it's been open and even went to their mock service right before opening. every experience i've had here has been wonderful! i've never had bad service and everything i've tried has been delicious! \nappetizers: \nfried artichoke - so good! i was shocked at how much i liked this dish because it seemed a little weird but it was delicious. \n<mark>White Wine Clams</mark> - first time i've ever tried clams before and they were really yummy. i'm not really a seafood person, but the sauce made it not too ocean-y. \n<mark>Fried Green Beans</mark>: garlic, flash fried, crunchy but not too crunchy. really good, i could eat those all day. \nmeatballs: oh my gosh. i'm not a fan of red sauce but i can't go to pizza rock without getting a side of meatballs!\n<mark>Gorgonzola & Apple</mark> salad: my favorite salad! i don't always eat all the apples because i don't typically like fruit in my salads, but the walnuts and gorgonzola with arugula and the dressing they use is ridiculous. if you get this as a main course, i would suggest asking for chicken breast in it to make it a little more dense, but it could definitely be used as a appetizer to share or as a main course for one. \n\npizzas: \n<mark>Honey Pie</mark>: perfect combination of sweet and spicy. i've had this one a few times and sometimes it's a little too much spice for my liking, but the sweetness mellows it out a little. \ncal-italia: my favorite pizza ever! i could go on and on about how delicious and amazing this pizza is. in my opinion, this is the best pizza in all of las vegas. the <mark>Balsamic Reduction</mark> is so good. it's salty, sweet, cheesy perfection. \n<mark>New Yorker</mark>: not my kind of pizza - too much meat for me. but the guys i was with when we got this one loved it. \n\ntoday i came for brunch with my mom. it was outstanding! the french toast ambrosia was out of this world. i was completely stuffed and still managed to eat all of it because it was so good! my mom got <mark>The Butcher 'All Meat'</mark> hash with scrambled egg white- it wasn't quite what we were expecting presentation wise but the flavor was excellent. overall an extremely enjoyable meal. our server, ryan (blonde hair), was fantastic! he was very friendly and knew the menu really well. he was able to answer all of my questions and was quick at bringing us what we asked for. the bottomless mimosas and sangria was great as well - i highly recommend the sangria! delicious!",

            "this is definitely not a typical pizza place- if you just want a plain traditional pizza, go somewhere else.  so far i've tried three different pizzas, and each one is better than the next.  \n\nmust try:\n~<mark>Honey Pie</mark>- savory pizza with honey on it- trust me!\n~romana iii pizza- this one is a mix of a proscuitto and tomato, ground beef, and nutella- all on a different third of the pizza.  the ingredients don't touch, so don't be grossed out.  the nutella/gorgonzola is life altering good.  you have to ask for extra nutella on it. \n~salumi and <mark>Salumi & Formaggio Board</mark>- you can build your own sandwich. \n\ngood but not amazing:\n~caesar salad- comes with whole anchovies on top, and kind of pricey considering it's just a caesar salad.\n~meatball appetizer- skip it and just save room for the <mark>Honey Pie</mark>. \n\nother: sometimes does groupon deals, and no more valet parking in front.  you can park in the grand's garage that's kitty corner, and they validate parking.",

            "i've now been to pizza rock twice. first things first, why not 5 stars? basically because i've been here twice and i have never been told that locals receive 20% off their bill. what the heck pizza rock? i don't typically go around asking, hey can i get a local discount? but. when i've been here twice and sung its praises to people - and yet, i've been able to get 20% off but haven't? arg. that ruffles my feathers.\n\non to what is good. happy hour is awesome. personal pizzas, apps, well drinks, and cocktails all on the cheap. my friends and i came here during hh and split all three of the personal pizzas and shared <mark>The Butcher 'All Meat'</mark>. okay. i'm no meatball expert but i think these are delicious. meaty, not bready, and the sauce it comes with compliments very well. i also like that these meatballs are simple. i've had way too many meatballs that have way too much going on with them. another reason i like them: you can cut them down the middle with your fork and they fall away in two pieces, not a bunch of lumpy, gross meat pieces. quality. i think.\n\nother than hh.... i came here with my hubby on a saturday night. luckily they have plenty of 2-top tables so we were seated quickly. service was quick and to the point. our server neither impressed me or upset me so i'll give a neutral rating for service.\n\nwhat we ordered... the <mark>New Yorker</mark> 23. it was the one pizza on the menu i figured my picky (and rather plain-jane) husband would enjoy. the <mark>New Yorker</mark> comes with: sliced mozzarella, <mark><mark>Tomato Sauce</mark></mark>, sliced house link sausage, garlic, pepperoni, ricotta. i asked for the link sausages to be removed and replaced with mushrooms. they were happy to oblige. under the menu it says, \"winner, best traditional, las vegas\". i'm not sure what that means.\n\noverall thoughts on the pizza... i enjoyed it. i love the thin crust style. the mix of cheese and sauce was perfect. pepperoni... okay. the ricotta cheese was an awesome addition, creamy and slightly sweet offsetting the heartiness of the pepperoni <mark>Clam and Garlic</mark>. the flavors were that of a \"normal\" pizza, but with a refinement. i think this was a perfect way to satisfy my more adventurous side and my husband's more traditional side.\n\nfinal decision: mine and my husband's dinner was a bit pricey. although delicious, i would rather go back for the happy hour. hh is your best bet here. and ya, go ahead and throw in the fact you're a local. you'll probably get a discount, unlike me. i'd also be interested in just heading up to the take out window to take a slice to go.\n\nother things i want to go back for:\n\ntheir margherita (only 73 made per day)\n<mark>Clam and Garlic</mark> pizza\n<mark>La Regina</mark> (the gold cup winner)\n<mark>Quail Egg White Rose Potato Guanciale</mark> pizza\n<mark>Cal Italia</mark> (again, this comes as one of the personal pizzas on hh menu and is a foodnetwork winner)\nthe chorizo mussels (app)\nand i would come back again for <mark>The Butcher 'All Meat'</mark>.\n\nlooks, like i'll be making a few return trips. the great thing is, i am so happy there is a good, inventive pizza place so close to where i live now.", 
            "i kept hearing about this tony guy and his award winning pizzas, i was excited to try a new pizzeria that was getting so much buzz. \n\ngoal was to try one pizza from each of the ovens.\n\nnapoletana - 900 degree wood stefano ferrara. we went with the margherita. this was pretty standard, nothing stood out, i felt it was served a bit cold as well, although michael made a good point, it couldn't been from the photo ops.\n\npizza romana - electric brick oven 700 degrees. we chose the romana iii. it's 3 pizzas in 1. 1/3 was gorgonzola, dates & pecans, <mark>Apples, Honey, Nutella</mark> (this was my favorite) 1/3 was <mark>Sweet Fig Preserves</mark>, prosciutto, gorgonzola, <mark>Balsamic Reduction</mark> (this was my second favorite) and the other portion was ricotta, garlic, basil, linguisa, <mark>Piquante Peppers</mark>. this was a nice option if you have lots of people in your party, you can a piece of each.\n\nclassic italian - gas brick oven 650 degrees. we chose the <mark>Cal Italia</mark>. this was the gold medal winner on the food network, and the winner for jaime w and i. i liked how all the ingredients came together.\n\ncalifornia - 900 degree wood fire oven. we chose the <mark>Quail Egg White Rose Potato Guanciale</mark>. this had a kick, spicy! this was my least favorite of the pizzas, not a fan of eggs on my pizza, but at least i can say i gave it a try. \n\nwe then sampled the <mark>Farmers Market</mark> pizza, weekly special using ingredients from downtown <mark>Farmers Market</mark>, this week it was pumpkin, brown sugar, cinnamon, bacon and topped with dollops of marshmallow. didn't really do anything for me. \n\ndessert, yes we still had room for dessert. <mark>Mud Pie</mark>, <mark>Pecan Turnover</mark> and desert calzone. nothing really excited me. it was all pretty standard. \n\noverall, i wasn't in love with this place. nothing was that spectacular that would make me drive to downtown and attempt to find parking. save this place for the tourists.", 
            "items selected:\n\nmargherita - 900f wood - napoletana with san marzano, mozzarella, fior di latte, basil, olive oil, <mark>Sea Salt</mark>\ncal-italia - gas brick - asiago, mozzarella, gorgonzola, fig, prosciutto, parmigiano-reggiano, balsamic\n<mark>Quail Egg White Rose Potato Guanciale</mark> - 900f wood - mozzarella, white rose potatoes, chorizo, pork cheek, rosemary, fromage blanc, calabrese peppers, lavender <mark>Sea Salt</mark>\nromana iii - electric brick - prosciutto/arugula/parmigiano, white cream/<mark>Chopped Garlic</mark>/meatball/olive oil, gorgonzola/date/pecan/apple/honey/nutella\nfarmer's market pizza - 900f wood - pumpkin puree, cinnamon, brown sugar, bacon, marshmallow\napple calzone - brown sugar, cinnamon, caramel, vanilla gelato\n<mark>Pecan Turnover</mark> - light puff pastry, maple pecan, crunch, coffee ice cream\n<mark>Mud Pie</mark> - oreo cookie crust, chocolate ganache, coffee vanilla bean ice cream, hot fudge, caramel, house made whipped cream\n \nhaving repeatedly neglected to visit tony's pizza napoletana in san francisco in favor of places like una pizzeria, pizzeria delfina, zero zero, and others i was admittedly intrigued when the well awarded chef opted to set up shop in downtown las vegas at pizza rock - the swanky new digs, multiple televisions, and guitar hero worthy playlist a far cry from the eponymous bay area location even though the multiple oven and top notch sourcing concepts remained intact - and it was with all those things in mind that myself and five others descended on the restaurant for a tasting of sizeable proportions, a total of 4.5 pizzas and three desserts served over the course of just over two hours with hit-and-miss results.  a surprisingly large space, literally big enough to park a truck, it was an early arrival that assured us use of the large private dining room and with excellent service from both the general manager plus an enthusiastic young waiter it would not be long before our pizzas started to arrive and brought out in three separate courses it was with the signatures that we began, the \"limited\" margherita proving cool to the touch and shockingly bland despite both excellent char and chew to the crust while the cal-italia proved far superior with a crunchy, toothsome crust more than able to stand up to a bevy  of toppings both sweet and savory, acidic and creamy.  moving next to the interesting yet overly complicated and entirely too spicy quail egg selection it was at last the \"3-course\" romana with its cracker crisp crust and well-paired toppings that wowed me most - the central third particularly well done with the rich meatballs nicely balanced by light cream and ample garlic, though the sweet selection was certainly not lacking in contrast or flavor either.  moving last to a gifted half of the farmer's market pizza, unfortunately overloaded with cinnamon just as the quail egg had been with spice, and finally to a trio of desserts where only the delicate <mark>Pecan Turnover</mark> would prove either inspired or memorable i think it is safe to say that the key to enjoying a meal at pizza rock is to simply embrace the concept and realize that \"everything to everyone\" and \"do one thing and do it well\" are very different mantras; the former definitely improved by a group of good people, excellent service, and (at least in this case) fond memories of 80's and 90's rock ballads.", 
            "this place is perfect for the group of people who each want a different style of pizza. thin, new york, sicilian, whatever... they'll have it plus different electric and wood ovens to boot. their extensive menu can be overwhelming for those that are indecisive, like me. so, it's best to peruse the menu ahead of time or just let someone else order. the <mark>Cal Italia</mark> ($18) was the best pizza i tried with its rich flavors from the sweetness of the figs to the savoriness of the prociutto. i also enjoyed the <mark>Quail Egg White Rose Potato Guanciale</mark> ($18) even though i'm typically not crazy about spicy foods. the roma iii ($32) is great if you're in the mood for an appetizer, entree, and dessert pie all in one. although the middle section with the <mark>White Cream Sauce</mark> <mark>Spaghetti and Meatballs</mark> was the main standout for me. not so impressive were the margherita ($16) and farmer's market (pumpkin puree, cinnamon, marshmallow). our group even had room for dessert. the <mark>Pecan Turnover</mark> and apple calzone more than satisfied my sweet tooth. the <mark>Mud Pie</mark>, after chiseling away at it, was a letdown. it only succeeded in making me feel guilty for consuming all those calories. so, while dishes were hit or miss, there's enough promise to warrant a return visit.\n\n3.5 stars", 
            "pizza overload!  so many different pies...different ovens...different toppings...no time for all that!\n\ncame with a group of yelpers with big appetites, so we were able to blast our way through quite a bit on the menu!\n\nmy favorite by far was the cal-italia ($18): asiago, mozzarella, imported gorgonzola, sweet fig preserve, prosciutto di parma, parmigiano-reggiano & <mark>Balsamic Reduction</mark>. this was excellent and the highlight of the meal for me! great mix of sweet, savory and vinegar/acidic flavors.  highly recommended :)\n\nanother great choice would be the margherita ($16): san marzano tomatoes, mozzarella fior di latte, basil, evoo and <mark>Sea Salt</mark>. honestly, this was probably the first enjoyable margheria i've had! not usually a fan of this style pie.  whatever they do differently here, i enjoyed...but you may not for the same reasons.\n\n<mark>Quail Egg White Rose Potato Guanciale</mark> ($18): mozzarella, white rose potatoes, chorizo, pork cheek, rosemary, fromage blanc, calabrese peppers & lavender <mark>Sea Salt</mark>. this was surprisingly spicy...a bit over the top, but still enjoyable.  order it knowing it's actually spicy, and you'll do just fine.\n\nromana iii ($32): 1) <mark>Sweet Fig Preserves</mark>, prosciutto, gorgonzola & <mark>Balsamic Reduction</mark>. 2) ricotta, garlic, basil, linguisa & <mark>Piquante Peppers</mark>. 3) gorgonzola, dates & pecans, and <mark>Apples, Honey, Nutella</mark>. interesting combinations here...the only one that didn't really satisfy was the middle portion. a bit spendy, but it's huge and serves 2-4 people.  i'd pass on this one next visit.\n\nfor dessert, we also tried quite a bit.  the best imo was the <mark>Pecan Turnover</mark> : light puff pastry, maple pecan, crunch & coffee ice cream. this was pretty tasty...probably the most enjoyable dessert we tried. came out piping hot too...yum :)\n\napple calzone : brown sugar, cinnamon, caramel & vanilla gelato. this is served with 2 calzones...pretty good overall but nothing extraordinary. \n\nmarket pizza : pumpkin puree, cinnamon, brown sugar, bacon & marshmallows. not really my kind of dessert...perhaps if you are a pumpkin lover?\n\n<mark>Mud Pie</mark> : oreo cookie crust, chocolate ganache, coffee vanilla bean ice cream, hot fudge, caramel & house made whipped cream. this was very frozen...hard as a rock. i enjoyed the cookie crust though. \n\nso it's a hit or miss kinda spot for me.  depending on what you order, your results will vary...for better and worse.\n\npics!", 
            "vegas folks are lucky that the vegas equivalent of sf's tony's pizza napoletana does not feature the 1 hour+ wait of the sf location. in true vegas fashion, this place has a lively and fun atmosphere, ample seating and today's featured soup: beer. i've come here a few times and some of the pizza were hits and some were misses, i wish i had taken better note of which of the pizzas i had already tried. one time my husband had us order the \"<mark>Quail Egg White Rose Potato Guanciale</mark>\" and the mix of toppings completely killed my taste buds, and the crust had a very burnt flavor (not the good kind i've had on their other pizzas). i personally wanted a pepperoni calzone that day and was really disappointed by what we ordered. we left the restaurant, went to commonwealth, and on our way back to our car, i stopped inside pizza rock and ordered a slice of pepperoni from the to-go area and it was heaven! their margherita 17 is another reliable favorite that has a subtle flavor and they advertise that they only make 73 per day. the staff here is usually on top of their game, very well-trained. one thing i love about this place is the dj mixing music videos - because who doesn't want to see chumbawumba being mixed into other 90's hits while eating delicious food? \n\nparking: park at the grand and get your valet ticket validated at pizza rock, super simple."

            "it's pretty simple..the pizza is a 5+ (like most of tony g's pies), but the ambience was a 3 for me.  really crowded and loud..and i know that's the vibe they were going for, so they accomplished their mission.  this is probably one of my few 4* yelp reviews where i wouldn't hesitate to go back over and over again.   the margherita pizza was phenomenal.  small, but amazing.  we ordered 3 for a group of 9.  we also had the <mark>New Yorker</mark>, which was also amazing.  throw in a <mark>Tomato Pie</mark> and a few apps and we were all stuffed with leftovers"

            "this restaurant was recommended to us by a hotel employee. she said it was the best pizza she had found in las vegas. great menu and awesome beer list. full bar too. good music playing as well. was loud enough to enjoy but not too loud where you couldn't talk. we started with the garlic cheese bread. was good and you could see the garlic pieces on it. yum! then got the <mark>New Yorker</mark> pizza. wow! great flavor, <mark>Garlic</mark> and perfect thin crust. give this place a try!!! and when you do, try to get sarah (red headed waitress) to be your server. her advice was great! she knows her beers and she definitely knows her pizza!", 
            "i've now been to pizza rock twice. first things first, why not 5 stars? basically because i've been here twice and i have never been told that locals receive 20% off their bill. what the heck pizza rock? i don't typically go around asking, hey can i get a local discount? but. when i've been here twice and sung its praises to people - and yet, i've been able to get 20% off but haven't? arg. that ruffles my feathers.\n\non to what is good. happy hour is awesome. personal pizzas, apps, well drinks, and cocktails all on the cheap. my friends and i came here during hh and split all three of the personal pizzas and shared <mark>The Butcher 'All Meat'</mark>. okay. i'm no meatball expert but i think these are delicious. meaty, not bready, and the sauce it comes with compliments very well. i also like that these meatballs are simple. i've had way too many meatballs that have way too much going on with them. another reason i like them: you can cut them down the middle with your fork and they fall away in two pieces, not a bunch of lumpy, gross meat pieces. quality. i think.\n\nother than hh.... i came here with my hubby on a saturday night. luckily they have plenty of 2-top tables so we were seated quickly. service was quick and to the point. our server neither impressed me or upset me so i'll give a neutral rating for service.\n\nwhat we ordered... the <mark>New Yorker</mark> 23. it was the one pizza on the menu i figured my picky (and rather plain-jane) husband would enjoy. the <mark>New Yorker</mark> comes with: sliced mozzarella, <mark><mark>Tomato Sauce</mark></mark>, sliced house link sausage, garlic, pepperoni, ricotta. i asked for the link sausages to be removed and replaced with mushrooms. they were happy to oblige. under the menu it says, \"winner, best traditional, las vegas\". i'm not sure what that means.\n\noverall thoughts on the pizza... i enjoyed it. i love the thin crust style. the mix of cheese and sauce was perfect. pepperoni... okay. the ricotta cheese was an awesome addition, creamy and slightly sweet offsetting the heartiness of the pepperoni <mark>Clam and Garlic</mark>. the flavors were that of a \"normal\" pizza, but with a refinement. i think this was a perfect way to satisfy my more adventurous side and my husband's more traditional side.\n\nfinal decision: mine and my husband's dinner was a bit pricey. although delicious, i would rather go back for the happy hour. hh is your best bet here. and ya, go ahead and throw in the fact you're a local. you'll probably get a discount, unlike me. i'd also be interested in just heading up to the take out window to take a slice to go.\n\nother things i want to go back for:\n\ntheir margherita (only 73 made per day)\n<mark>Clam and Garlic</mark> pizza\n<mark>La Regina</mark> (the gold cup winner)\n<mark>Quail Egg White Rose Potato Guanciale</mark> pizza\n<mark>Cal Italia</mark> (again, this comes as one of the personal pizzas on hh menu and is a foodnetwork winner)\nthe chorizo mussels (app)\nand i would come back again for <mark>The Butcher 'All Meat'</mark>.\n\nlooks, like i'll be making a few return trips. the great thing is, i am so happy there is a good, inventive pizza place so close to where i live now.", 
            "the <mark>New Yorker</mark> pizza definitely lived up to the hype, but the service was awful. i never received a refill on my drink and the server (ryan) never checked on us after taking the order. we sat for about 40 minutes waiting for a refill, box and the check and finally had to ask someone to help us. \n\ni would go back for the food, but am not sure due to the service and the lack of caring. \n\ntoo bad that such a great place has employees that don't care about customer service.", 
            "so its time to update my last review for pizza rock.  i must say once i posted my last yelp review  the owner, trevor responded to me immediately-within hours of the post.  he was entirely all over the issue, asking for details and assured me that all issues would be addressed which is all that i had hoped for. \n \nmy second visit was quite the opposite of my last experience and i was anticipating some kind of issues.  first off,  it was new years eve and second we had a reservation for a party of 12.  we started out with 10 people and added 2 more the day before with no problem.  when we arrived a few of us went to the bar to order a drink anticipating  to wait a little bit before being seated.  the bartender (i didn't get his name) was more than helpful and a very cool guy with corona shaped new years glasses. ;)   amazingly we were seated within 5 minutes as the other people around us were looking at over an hour wait-because they didn't have reservations.  i highly recommend the reservations-especially on a major holiday.  immediately we were greeted by our server anisa with a smile and excitement that we were there and she was ready to help us in any way possible.  i must say i was greatly surprised at the service we received with all the factors i mentioned above.  anisa was both personable and attentive that we hardly realized that she was serving other several tables.  a simple thing that makes you a super server-unfortunately not everyone can have that talent.   drinks were flowing and we all ordered with 3 or 4 split checks without any issues.  for 5 of us we ordered the <mark>New Yorker</mark> and the <mark>Cal Italia</mark> pizzas.  the <mark>New Yorker</mark> is the most amazing pizza i have ever had...that is what we ordered the last time so you know it has to be good.  it is topped with sausage and little <mark>Pepperoni</mark>....but my favorite part was the super creamy ricotta strategically placed on top where you could spread it around with your fork to savor a little on every bite.  yum.  the <mark>Cal Italia</mark> had prosciutto and a balsalmic drizzle  that had a flavor like none other.  seriously between the two pizzas we were 100% satisfied and all was gone except for one slice in the end.  not too bad for 5 people.  others ordered <mark>Spaghetti and Meatballs</mark> (it was gigantic), lasagna (which my man said he may have to order next time-it looked fabulous), the romana  ii (which gives you a little variety and its big enough to share).  everyone was very happy with their food and we left full and tipsy. =)\n\nnow we did have a small incident where one of my guests spilled a whole glass of ice water all over me.  it could have been worse right??   anisa, even though it wasn't their fault, comp'ed us a pizza just for the inconvenience which was definitely not expected by any means.  we definitely were pleased with  our server so much that we will ask for her the next time we visit.\n\nall i can say is finally some good quality food downtown.  we've been waiting a long time for some good eats out there.  you can bet that's where we will be eating while we are down there.  thank you trevor, for listening to my concerns and working out the kinks.  i believe an honorable owner is one that listens to the customer and strives to correct the issues no matter how big or small they may be.  and thanks to anisa for making our new years eve dinner a special one to remember.  happy new year pizza rock - my new years resolution is to see you often in 2014.  cheers!", 
            "used yelp to help find a good lunch on freemont street and it didn't disappoint .  no wait to speak of at noon thirty .  place was bigger than expected and had a nice vibe.  loud alt rock playing with tvs showing sportscenter .  our waiter was good and the food was tasty.  went with the gorgonzola fries and the <mark>New Yorker</mark> pizza .  checked in with yelp and got 15% off the bill. nice.  you could sit down for lunch or order a slice at the front counter or street window.  bet thats handy when your bar hopping on freemont.  although you couldn't  order by the slice at the table.  you have to get a whole pie.  would definitely come back and try a burger, table next to us ordered 3 and they looked pretty good.", 
            "best pizza on las vegas! try the margerita (winner of best pizza in sicily, italy) it will blow your taste buds away! whatever you think that pizza should taste like... its totally wrong! its that good! \n\nwe also had the <mark>New Yorker</mark> and the cal-italia also another winner of some medal (believe it was a food network challenge) just incredibly good! \n\nthis place will quickly become my first stop in vegas next time.", 
            "their pizza is out of this world. that's all you need to know.\n\nmy first visit was during yelp helps week and it was a great setting to try this eatery since there were so many of us, which meant that we had the opportunity to try so many different pies (of course, that also meant we were stuffed!). that night, i tried eight of their pies, a couple appetizers, desserts, and a cocktail. everything was so good that i returned just four days later with my fiance and friend hally!\n\nduring my return visit, i had to order the margherita ($16) again. the dough is hand-mixed with san felice flour and proofed in neapolitan wood boxes, then it's topped with san marzano tomatoes, mozzarella, fior di latte, basil, evoo, and <mark>Sea Salt</mark>. finally, it's baked in a 900-degree wood stefano ferrara oven. it's limited to 73 pies daily (although i heard they've gotten no where near that amount yet) and it won the world pizza cup in naples, italy. true neopolitan pizza! \n\nthe three of us also shared the downtown ($19): pepperoni, molinari salami, bacon, chives, mushrooms, red onions, bell peppers, <mark>Black Olives</mark>, <mark><mark>Extra Cheese, Pepperoni, or Italian Fennel Sausage</mark></mark>, <mark><mark>Cherry Tomato</mark></mark>; which is one of their \"american originals\" pizzas that all feature <mark><mark>Tomato Sauce</mark></mark>, mozzarella, and a rustic medium crust, baked in a gas brick oven at 550 degrees. as well as the <mark>Honey Pie</mark> ($17): quail hollow farm honey, calabrese peppers, <mark>Green Onions</mark>, mozzarella, piave cheese, fried <mark><mark>Caramelized Onions</mark></mark>, serrano peppers; one of their \"california\" pizzas that use caputo flour and baked in a 900-degree wood fire oven. \n\nthe downtown reminded me of a \"supreme/deluxe\" pizza, but definitely better. i had tried the <mark>Honey Pie</mark> during the first visit and although it wasn't one of my favorites that evening, i came to appreciate its flavors the second time around. i also tried their <mark>Classic Caesar</mark> salad ($10) and it was tasty. for drinks, i tried the strawberry fields martini ($9.50): stoli strawberry, strawberry puree and a hint of mint and hally ordered the moscow mule ($12): stoli vodka, ginger beer, and fresh squeezed lemon juice. both really delicious cocktails. \n\nfrom both visits, my favorite pizzas are the margherita, <mark>Honey Pie</mark>, and <mark>New Yorker</mark> and i absolutely loved the sweet nothing cocktail, so good. i didn't care for the <mark>Calamari Fritti</mark>, rosemary garlic fries, or the mastunicola pizza. anyway, i could eat that margherita pizza every day. it's that good. i have to keep telling myself to not order it, just so i can try their other delicious concoctions (i have my eyes on the <mark>Pizza Campari</mark>, <mark>Clam and Garlic</mark>, and proscuitto e pomodorini). hands down, definitely my favorite pizza joint now (sorry grimaldi's). but seriously, award-winning pies, five different pizza ovens, quality ingredients - you're convinced right?\n\nparking is best on the surrounding streets like on casino center blvd (meters take credit cards, yay, but you can only pay hourly at $1/hour) or free valet at the downtown grand (super easy and close). oh, and don't forget your locals discount!! win.", 
            "i went to pizza rock with high expectations, based on some articles and reviews i had read, and the fact that it features international award-winning pizza.  but,  unfortunately, those expectations were not entirely met.\n\nitalian wedding soup was very good spicy and hearty soup, but nothing like traditional italian wedding soup.  it was more like minestrone with medium-sized meatballs, carrots, celery, tomatoes, ditalini noodles, and basil.  i was mostly pleased with a <mark>Classic Caesar</mark> salad that sported a good light caesar dressing with a little kick to it and a little sour flavoring, cold romaine leaves, and lemony pieces of parmesan sheets.  but it was in the all-important pizza department that i was somewhat disappointed.\n\na three cheese & ham pizza with extra cheese was very good except for the parmesan powder tossed on top.  and the internationally recognized margherita pizza was excellent.  no complaints there!  but, with respect to the <mark>New Yorker</mark>, which was voted the best traditional pizza in the world, i felt that the ricotta cheese and <mark><mark>Tomato Sauce</mark></mark> were overpowering and in too much supply, compared with the amount of sliced mozzarella, sliced house link sausage, garlic, <mark>Sausage and Peppers</mark> that shared the stage; and the crust was much thinner than i prefer.  \n\noverall, from my single experience, although the margherita pizza prepared here can definitely hold its own, even in the las vegas valley alone i would rank the other types of pizza i tried here behind dom demarco's, cosmopolitan's secret pizza, metro pizza, settebello's, biaggio's, and enzo's.\n\nthe place has a nice spacious and informal ambiance, although it is rather dark inside.  besides a large bar, white butcher paper is spread on white formica and black-edged tables.  our server allie provided friendly and very helpful service.  \n\nthe pizza sampled here was not at all bad.  it just wasn't as great as i thought it would be.\n\n3-1/2 stars overall!",

            "mmmmm pizza rock! let me start with normally i'm not a huge pizza person. my husband joel on the other hand could eat pizza everyday and be perfectly happy. so when our friends dyanna and brent suggested pizza for our dinner out one saturday night i knew joel would be down! \n\nsince it was saturday night we had to wait 45 minutes. the hostess were nice, but could have given a little more instruction. they said that they'd text me when our table was ready, but the only text i got was one saying we should head to the hostess stand and wait. which we did for 15 more minutes. finally, we were seated. it was a hot night so we ordered lots of water. if your feeling like something other then water they have a fully stocked bar too. plus, real mexican cokes! \n\nnow, let's talk pizza! they have so many! i love that with the description they tell you the degree that they cook the pizza at. from traditional to the unique they have it. dyanna and i both ordered a side salad and they ordered a <mark>New Yorker</mark> and we ordered the cali italia. wow! i really enjoyed the salad dressing which was a super <mark>Garlic</mark> and creamy vinaigrette. our cali italia pizza had a lot of cheeses, <mark>Sweet Fig Preserves</mark>, prosciutto and a <mark>Balsamic Reduction</mark>. it had that total savory, salty and sweet thing going on. a must try if your looking for something non traditional. dyanna and brent's pizza was very classic and joel could not stop talking about it! \n\nthe atmosphere, once seated, had a fun rock n roll vibe! flat screen tvs are all around the restaurant which play old school music videos. yay! they even have a huge truck in the middle of the place that is the  dj booth. along the walls are other rooms that give u some privacy if you have a large group. perfect for a bachelor or bachelorette party. \n\npizza rock has some tasty pizza. it's been on my mind since we went. make sure if your going on the weekend you call ahead for a reservation. also, check yelp for 15% off your check when you check in. (make sure you inform your waitress.)parking can be hard in this area of downtown. i suggest using the downtown grand valet. you can park for free and get it validated at the hostess stand at pizza rock. follow these few tips and your experience at pizza rock really will rock!", 
            "you need to come here! this pizza is delicious and the service is great. we visited on a sunday to have dinner with friends. they had gone the day before and absolutely had to go back ( that says tons in itself). we were not drinking so we had las vegas coolers which were refreshing and not overwhelmingly sweet. we decided on the <mark>New Yorker</mark> and the <mark>Frank Nitti</mark>. the nitti has thin crispy crust with just the right amount of sauce <mark>Mac and Cheese</mark>. the spinach had good flavor and texture. the ricotta was the perfect touch. the way it was baked was perfect! the ingredients were balanced to let you taste everything on the pizza and not focus on one ingredient particularly. the <mark>New Yorker</mark> lived up to its name. the crust was a little thicker and had a great consistency. what stuck me was the sausage. such a distinct fresh flavor!!! amazing... the sauce to cheese ratio was perfect. <mark>The Butcher 'All Meat'</mark> were all delicious and generous throughout the pie. come here tell your friends to come here!!! i never say that in reviews but the food and service most definitely warrant. next trip to vegas will definitely include this pizza.", 
            "on saturday before life is beautiful, we decided to come here and watch college football. the bar had plenty of seating so we grabbed some seats and ordered drinks. our bartender was nice enough to accommodate our request for the spartans game.\n\nonto the menu! they have a nice beer selection, and the menu for pizza is huge. it's divided into all these different styles. there's really no small, medium, large. each style of pizza comes in a set size. \n\nwe picked the <mark>New Yorker</mark>, which i would say feeds about 3 people. i wanted to order more things, but the bf knew my eyes were much hungrier than my stomach, and plus we didn't have anywhere to store leftovers as we were going to the festival after. good call because i was stuffed. anyway, omg, this pizza was soooo good!  i think it was <mark>Extra Cheese, Pepperoni, or Italian Fennel Sausage</mark>, mushroom, fresh mozzerella, and little dollops of ricotta on a thin chewy crust. everything about this pizza was amazing. in fact, i think i even said, \"this might be the best pizza i've ever eaten.\" \n\nwhen i came to pizza rock for the yelp elite event, i have to say i was not that impressed. it's probably because they weren't prepared for how many people were there and everything was just chaos and the food wasn't prepared as well. who knows. all i know is this time around the pizza was on point!\n\nmy only complaint is that the drinks are so expensive. $12 for a moscow mule? aren't we downtown at a pizza joint? i guess that's downtown prices now. either way, i can't wait to go back and get more pizza!  also, they serve by the slice at the window by the entrance.", 
            "this reveiw is only for the pizza thats what i ate. i loved it. the sauce was damn near perfect not to sweet not to acidic, the dough was fresh and cooked right not chewy and not a cracker eithier. service was good ambiance was cool it was a cool place to eat . location is perfect easy to park . i actually ate here twice once sit in and had a pizza second time was just for a slice. the pizza i had was the <mark>New Yorker</mark> the slice i had was a pepperoni the slice was huge it was a little pricey but no where neer the 100 i dumped  on a slot machine around the corner and the machine didnt feed me. i would eat here again. im from north new jersey and live in the bay area now i know what good pizza is. this place is worth a try", 
            "here we are again. it's a busy monday night, the football crew is all in :)\nthe service, even though busy, was excellent, attentive but not hovering, pleasant, but not too chatty. the food, the food!!! all exceptional! we had the <mark>New Yorker</mark> pizza and the linguine with clams. if you don't love this place, i'd be very surprised.", 
            "while i've been here more since my last review in june, i went twice last week because the person i was with had not been there yet. after the first time, we were back the very next day.  we had the <mark>New Yorker</mark> the first day which was <mark>Extra Cheese, Pepperoni, or Italian Fennel Sausage</mark>, and ricotta dollops on it. amazing!  i'm actually starting to like the thinner crust more and more each time i visit.  no need for me to divulge in thick crust.   the second day, he got the same pizza, and i had the chicken parmesan. the chicken was cooked perfectly, the crust around it was crispy and perfect, sauce <mark>Mac and Cheese</mark> all delish. the only thing i didn't like was the bucatini pasta under it. it's quite thick and either wasn't cooked long enough, or that's just how it is...either way, i wasn't a fan so if i do order that again, i'll go for a different type of pasta.", 
            "so i read an article about pizza rock, in one of the magazines that is in the seat back pocket on the airplane. the article made it sound pretty good so we read some reviews on yelp and decided to give it a try. this place, pardon the pun, rocks!\n\nfirst off, the location is only one block off of freemont street, on third street, an easy walk from all of the freemont street action.\n\nthe place has a really cool grunge, rock bar feel, yet it is appropriate for all ages. our 11 year old and 19 year old both really liked the place, especially the good music/video mix they have playing.\n\nwe visited pizza rock twice while we were in vegas. visit #1 was so good, we had to go back for more a few days later.\n\nvisit #1 - i can't remember the server's name, but she was awesome. her recommendations were spot on and our drinks were always full. we ordered the <mark>Cal Italia</mark> pizza which is a sauceless pizza with asiago, mozzarella, gorgonzola, fig preserve, prosciutto, and <mark>Balsamic Reduction</mark>. it was amazing. one of the best pizzas we've ever had. my 11 year old had the margherita and it was very similar to the margherita pizzas you find in rome. we finished lunch with a tiramisu and it was extraordinary! the best i have ever had!\n\nvisit #2 - the second time we came to the restaurant was a saturday around 10 pm and it was significantly busier than our visit a few days earlier, at lunch. this time we had the <mark>New Yorker</mark>, which was good, but it did have too much garlic and the ricotta gave the pizza an odd taste. if you are a garlic and ricotta fan, you will like it, me not so much. we also ordered <mark>Frank's True Italian (Thin Crust)</mark>, which is a pesto pizza similar to the style you find at grimaldi's, it was very good.\n\nlong story short, this place is a top notch pizza joint and it deserves all of the awards it has won. my favorite pizza place in nevada, bar none.", 
            "the <mark>New Yorker</mark> was the best pizza i have ever tasted!!! there was four of us in our group and we were all blown away. the caprese salad was wonderful as well.", 
            "had the <mark>New Yorker</mark>. it was very good, although it did not wow me. everyone has different tastes but it just didn't live up to the hype i've heard. planning to return to try others because i'm positive i can find something that will blow me away. got the <mark>New Yorker</mark> (most popular ) so anything is fair game", 
            "having heard of pizza rock from my brother, and how it had apparently been growing exponentially in the vegas scene, i had to see what this place was all about. having tried dozens of different pizza places, whether they be mom and pop shops, or simple commercial, pizza rock undoubtedly takes the crown as king. i've tried their <mark>Cal Italia</mark>, <mark>New Yorker</mark>, and margherita pizza on differing occasions, and all i have to say, is it's worth the drive to downtown. \n\nthe <mark>Cal Italia</mark> was such a fulfilling pizza; with the balasmic reduction and fig creating a balanced concoction of deliciousness. \n\nthe margherita pizza was exactly what you would hope to get from one. tender crust, great sauce, and fresh cheese. it was light and satisfying.\n\nas for the <mark>New Yorker</mark>, it would be worth paying even $35 for it. coming from an avid meat lovers pizza enthusiast, this pie is all you need in your life. its almost a sin to grab more than one slice. the meat is succulent with a light kick, the cheese creamy and chewy, and crust perfectly foldable. highly recommend trying!", 
            "best pizza in las vegas.  i thought the <mark>New Yorker</mark> with ricatta was a sin, but it works really well.  hint of sweet with the savory is great.  the tiramitsu is amazing also.  love this place.  recommend.",

            "i love this place! although it is really, really loud...and i don't normally like loud with my food...the food is really that good. i was worried it was all hype, like a lot of newer places can be in this part of town...but i was pleasantly surprised. we have eaten there 5 or 6 times now and each time has been a great experience. i'm in love with their <mark>Salumi & Formaggio Board</mark> and the <mark>New Yorker</mark> pizza with flavorful sauce, sausage and other fresh ingredients finished off with an even smattering of cool ricotta - oh yum!  the service is also always friendly and attentive. \n\none thing: i do wish they would put the dividers back in to the little alcoves on the side of the room with the curtains. it was great for a little romantic dinner amidst all the bustle outside of the curtains. last time we went there prepared for romance and met with another couple who were also seated a little too close for comfort with no divider! well, hello there! :)",

            "it's pretty simple..the pizza is a 5+ (like most of tony g's pies), but the ambience was a 3 for me.  really crowded and loud..and i know that's the vibe they were going for, so they accomplished their mission.  this is probably one of my few 4* yelp reviews where i wouldn't hesitate to go back over and over again.   the margherita pizza was phenomenal.  small, but amazing.  we ordered 3 for a group of 9.  we also had the <mark>New Yorker</mark>, which was also amazing.  throw in a <mark>Tomato Pie</mark> and a few apps and we were all stuffed with leftovers",

            "walking distance from fremont street, a great stop for dinner!  order by the slice in the bar or sit down and share.  \n\n<mark>New Yorker</mark> - voted best pizza for a reason.  highly recommend, with sausage, pepperoni, ricotta cheese.  mmm.\ndetroit red top - do not order.  too thin/burnt, not enough cheese, sauce very runny.  fail.\n\ngreat service and ambiance.", 
            "good googly moogly! \n\nhands down best pizza we've had. maybe ever? i'm sitting here 4 days later racking my mind to see if i can think of any other place that i've had better pizza. i cannot think of anything else, my friends. we ordered:\n\ngarlic bread - good, but not amazing. \ncalamari - good, but not great. the spicy was crazy spicy though. i just wasn't a fan. \nsausage and stout - i wasn't the biggest fan, but everyone else dug it. \n<mark>New Yorker</mark> - yes. yes yes yes. so good! if you haven't tried this one, please do. everything from the crust, marinara, and toppings were amazing!\n<mark>Old Chicago</mark> - another yes. this was probably my favorite. mostly because of that sausage. \n\noverall, this place was amazing. my favorite thing - the ricotta cheese. that stuff was so light, fluffy and flavorful. i don't eat pizza that often, but i have never craved it so much that i can't stop thinking about it for the next few days. \n\ntop choice for vegas pizza.", 
            "when my family told me about pizza rock, i had no idea that i was in for a real treat!  <mark>The Butcher 'All Meat'</mark> appetizer was wonderful!  the marinara sauce is unbelievable!  that is a staple on our items to share, along with the <mark>New Yorker</mark> pizza.  on another note, i must mention that we  dined there the other day for lunch.  our server, jj, was not good at all.  my brother ordered a salad without croutons, (croutons in salad); asked for a glass with my beer (different server, no glass), and ordered the mostaccioli with the marinara sauce, only.  we mentioned that we cannot have <mark>White Cream Sauce</mark> since we have disgestion issues.  when this dish arrived, it came with melted cheese on top, along with a spicy <mark>White Cream Sauce</mark>.  in essence, jj did not hear a word we said in our initial order and acted like he couldn't be bothered.  we had to flagged him down for any of our needs.  we were very disappointed with him.",

            "today is day one of the week long grand opening for pizza rock!  so excited to hear another new establishment has moved downtown!  what's even better was i heard they were showcasing their menu for the public and fine tune the overall experience for the actual opening on saturday.  originally, we heard you needed reservations to eat there for free this week, however, a coworker mentioned to us that folks working downtown will be able to roll in without reservations and be seated for dinner.  this was a perfect opportunity for a couple of us to have a nice dinner after a hard day's work!\n\nthe restaurant is on the corner of ogden and 3rd st, attached to the mob bar and triple george saloon.  right away, you notice the huge \"pizza rock\" sign from the outside, bordered by flame artwork.  when you enter, there's a nice seating area with a very friendly hostess station.  everyone was super excited to greet you and take your name.  because of the grand opening, we were able to walk around the restaurant and take a look at the decor.  to the right of the hostess stand was the pizza takeout window with a viewable kitchen.  pretty cool.  after the seating area, the main focal point of the restaurant is the life sized semi truck in the middle of the dining area.  super cool!  it serves as a multi purpose art.  aside from the obvious attention grabber, it's the new dj station and serves to break up the bar area and dining area.  wow! the bar is huge and gorgeous!  lots of metal art accents around it.  lots of exposed brick around the restaurant.  they even have little private coves for seating in the dining area if you want to entertain that romantic date or have an intimate family dinner.  lots going on and it all seems to work.  \n\nwhen we were greeted by our server, shirley, we were informed of a couple of things:  they didn't have pasta, they didn't have bread, they didn't have sausage and they didn't have steak.  kind of bummed about it but everything else was free so i couldn't really complain.  shirley was a bit flustered as i expected on day one.  she quoted the wrong price for wine, ordered our food at different times which resulted in a lot of waiting and found herself making multiple trips to the table, because of the lack of efficiency.  i completely understand.  first day jitters are a given.  she had a great personality and that ended up going a long way in my book.\n\nfor dinner, here's what we got:\n\n<mark>Classic Caesar</mark>, normally for $10.00:  hearts of romaine, homemade caesar dressing, house croutons and shaved pieces of parmigiano-reggiano.  definitely a shareable dish.  i think this could comfortable feed 3 people as their first course.  lots of fresh ingredients, but i didn't have a few issues with this salad.  the croutons were way too toasted and very crunchy.  the dressing, as being the star of the dish was way too tangy.  they made it with a lot of anchovies.  now i'm a huge fan of homemade caesar dressing but this was way too overpowered with anchovies.\n\nmargherita pizza, normally for $15.00:  this pizza was a 2007 world pizza cup winner in italy!  hand mixed dough using imported flour and proofed in wood boxed imported from italy.  wow.  san marzano tomatoes, mozzarella cheese, basil, extra virgin olive oil and <mark>Sea Salt</mark>.  the dough from the crust was amazing but the crust turned out a little burnt and had a slightly bitter taste.  the sauce was one of the stars of the show, nice and creamy.  mozzarella was flavorful and there were a lot for a margherita, which was awesome.  the only critique was the basil.  not enough to taste that element which makes a great pie. \n\ndowntown pizza, normally for $19.00:  wow, lots going on!  mozzarella, pepperoni, salami, bacon, chives, mushrooms, read onions, bell peppers, olives, <mark><mark>Extra Cheese, Pepperoni, or Italian Fennel Sausage</mark></mark> and <mark><mark>Cherry Tomato</mark></mark>.  think of it as an upgraded supreme.  with all these ingredients, there was no lack of flavor!  wow loved the flavor punch.  my only feedback was the crust was too thin for this pizza.  it couldn't support the amount of toppings.  it became soggy real fast and we ended up losing a lot of the toppings on the table.  \n\nmanhattan calzone, normally for $12.00:  stuffed with meatballs, mozzarella, ricotta <mark>Clam and Garlic</mark>.  as my friend put it, you would pay 12 bucks f<mark>Classic Pepperoni or Cheese</mark> and bread.  lots of cheese.  omg, it was everywhere.  i personally don't think ricotta is needed.  maybe use a lot more meat to balance out the cheese.  holy cheese!  \n\nduring this week, all menu food items are free.  our entire bill was comped which was the best part of the evening.  please remember to tip your servers great!  this review, i've created, is to give the best and most valuable feedback, so this place thrives downtown.  just the ambiance alone will take them far.  i will certainly be back to try other items of the menu.  next time, i'm hitting the steak and pasta hard!", 
            "coconut cooler with a hint of lime (very refreshing, really nice).  coconut curry beer (surprisingly pretty good).  a few blue moons and a spanish fly (really enjoyed the agave nectar).  chorizo mussels served in a spicy <mark><mark>Tomato Sauce</mark></mark> over thick chunks of toasted bread.  battered & fried (not greasy!) large whole artichokes served with a slightly spice aioli (nice size for the price and were slightly addicting).  and this was just the beginning (go ahead, read it again with a smile).\n\nsix hungry, hedonistic gastronomes with an expectation of sumptuous, savory sustenance drawn from a not-so-long-ago memory of amazing pizza in san francisco.  tony's pizza napoletano.\n\nwill tony's pizza be just as good here as it was in san francisco? will the hot (ok, not so hot in november), dry mojave desert climate affect the chewy goodness of tony's pizza crusts?  will two pizza's suffice?  perhaps we should opt for three?  perhaps order two and add a third later?  our friendly server, autumn, suggested placing our order all together due to several large parties.  thank you, autumn!\n\nhere goes:\n<mark>Clam and Garlic</mark> - omg.  best damn clam pizza we've had.  perfect goldilock-sized pieces of clam with garlic generously enveloping every bite.\n\ndiavola - like spicy?  we like spicy.  and we really like diavola!  a spicy pie served with generous chunks of sopressata, mozzarella, and arugala.  and oh yes, a spicy <mark><mark>Tomato Sauce</mark></mark>.  i loved that the arugala was ever so slightly wilted, providing a slight pepperiness without being overly bitter.\n\nqual <mark>Quail Egg White Rose Potato Guanciale</mark> - guanciale is one of our favorite italian pork products.  the rich flavor of the buttery guanciale paired beautifully with the delicate flavors of the potato, quail egg, and mozzarella.  very nicely done!\n\nafter consuming all but a small slice of the clam & garlic and looking at it sadly, then glancing around the table, we realized we were satisfyingly satisfied.\n\nand then autumn brought the dessert menu.  mind you, we were stuffed.  truly.  i just kept thinking how perhaps a bit of gelato would... i don't know, do... something.  so, since we started a coconut trend earlier in the evening i delightedly selected some coconut sorbet.  my sister chose the <mark>Pecan Turnover</mark> - a puff pastry brimming with a sweet maple-pecan crunch and a generous serving of ice cream on top.  the coconut sorbet was a very generous serving of refreshing coconut, and i feel badly and a little sad that i wasted so much.\n\nare you a local?  do you love pizza?  do you like hanging downtown?  me too!  and guess what?!  locals receive a discount.  oh yes.  keep me coming back, baby.  and... they have take out.  i sense mastunicola in my future (by the way, google translator is great for learning how to correctly pronounce italian pizza names).\n\nwelcome to vegas, tony and crew!  we are so glad you came.", 
            "i've now been to pizza rock twice. first things first, why not 5 stars? basically because i've been here twice and i have never been told that locals receive 20% off their bill. what the heck pizza rock? i don't typically go around asking, hey can i get a local discount? but. when i've been here twice and sung its praises to people - and yet, i've been able to get 20% off but haven't? arg. that ruffles my feathers.\n\non to what is good. happy hour is awesome. personal pizzas, apps, well drinks, and cocktails all on the cheap. my friends and i came here during hh and split all three of the personal pizzas and shared <mark>The Butcher 'All Meat'</mark>. okay. i'm no meatball expert but i think these are delicious. meaty, not bready, and the sauce it comes with compliments very well. i also like that these meatballs are simple. i've had way too many meatballs that have way too much going on with them. another reason i like them: you can cut them down the middle with your fork and they fall away in two pieces, not a bunch of lumpy, gross meat pieces. quality. i think.\n\nother than hh.... i came here with my hubby on a saturday night. luckily they have plenty of 2-top tables so we were seated quickly. service was quick and to the point. our server neither impressed me or upset me so i'll give a neutral rating for service.\n\nwhat we ordered... the <mark>New Yorker</mark> 23. it was the one pizza on the menu i figured my picky (and rather plain-jane) husband would enjoy. the <mark>New Yorker</mark> comes with: sliced mozzarella, <mark><mark>Tomato Sauce</mark></mark>, sliced house link sausage, garlic, pepperoni, ricotta. i asked for the link sausages to be removed and replaced with mushrooms. they were happy to oblige. under the menu it says, \"winner, best traditional, las vegas\". i'm not sure what that means.\n\noverall thoughts on the pizza... i enjoyed it. i love the thin crust style. the mix of cheese and sauce was perfect. pepperoni... okay. the ricotta cheese was an awesome addition, creamy and slightly sweet offsetting the heartiness of the pepperoni <mark>Clam and Garlic</mark>. the flavors were that of a \"normal\" pizza, but with a refinement. i think this was a perfect way to satisfy my more adventurous side and my husband's more traditional side.\n\nfinal decision: mine and my husband's dinner was a bit pricey. although delicious, i would rather go back for the happy hour. hh is your best bet here. and ya, go ahead and throw in the fact you're a local. you'll probably get a discount, unlike me. i'd also be interested in just heading up to the take out window to take a slice to go.\n\nother things i want to go back for:\n\ntheir margherita (only 73 made per day)\n<mark>Clam and Garlic</mark> pizza\n<mark>La Regina</mark> (the gold cup winner)\n<mark>Quail Egg White Rose Potato Guanciale</mark> pizza\n<mark>Cal Italia</mark> (again, this comes as one of the personal pizzas on hh menu and is a foodnetwork winner)\nthe chorizo mussels (app)\nand i would come back again for <mark>The Butcher 'All Meat'</mark>.\n\nlooks, like i'll be making a few return trips. the great thing is, i am so happy there is a good, inventive pizza place so close to where i live now.", 
            "this place knows good pizza.  the dough and crust seriously rock - perfectly cooked just the way they do in the northeast or in italy.  i had the <mark>Clam and Garlic</mark> pizza which was totally delicious, though i would have rather had the claims served out of the shell.  i'm a big dessert guy, and while the <mark>Dessert Calzone</mark> wasn't bad, i'd probably go for something sweeter next time.  major points for having ginger beer on the drinks menu.  service was excellent.  next time i'm in vegas i'll be coming back.", 
            "the pizza <mark>Clam and Garlic</mark> fries were amazing. our server ryan with the hair was super. he was quick to recommend items in the menu and very helpful. we will be back great food and friendly servers.", 
            "their pizza is out of this world. that's all you need to know.\n\nmy first visit was during yelp helps week and it was a great setting to try this eatery since there were so many of us, which meant that we had the opportunity to try so many different pies (of course, that also meant we were stuffed!). that night, i tried eight of their pies, a couple appetizers, desserts, and a cocktail. everything was so good that i returned just four days later with my fiance and friend hally!\n\nduring my return visit, i had to order the margherita ($16) again. the dough is hand-mixed with san felice flour and proofed in neapolitan wood boxes, then it's topped with san marzano tomatoes, mozzarella, fior di latte, basil, evoo, and <mark>Sea Salt</mark>. finally, it's baked in a 900-degree wood stefano ferrara oven. it's limited to 73 pies daily (although i heard they've gotten no where near that amount yet) and it won the world pizza cup in naples, italy. true neopolitan pizza! \n\nthe three of us also shared the downtown ($19): pepperoni, molinari salami, bacon, chives, mushrooms, red onions, bell peppers, <mark>Black Olives</mark>, <mark><mark>Extra Cheese, Pepperoni, or Italian Fennel Sausage</mark></mark>, <mark><mark>Cherry Tomato</mark></mark>; which is one of their \"american originals\" pizzas that all feature <mark><mark>Tomato Sauce</mark></mark>, mozzarella, and a rustic medium crust, baked in a gas brick oven at 550 degrees. as well as the <mark>Honey Pie</mark> ($17): quail hollow farm honey, calabrese peppers, <mark>Green Onions</mark>, mozzarella, piave cheese, fried <mark><mark>Caramelized Onions</mark></mark>, serrano peppers; one of their \"california\" pizzas that use caputo flour and baked in a 900-degree wood fire oven. \n\nthe downtown reminded me of a \"supreme/deluxe\" pizza, but definitely better. i had tried the <mark>Honey Pie</mark> during the first visit and although it wasn't one of my favorites that evening, i came to appreciate its flavors the second time around. i also tried their <mark>Classic Caesar</mark> salad ($10) and it was tasty. for drinks, i tried the strawberry fields martini ($9.50): stoli strawberry, strawberry puree and a hint of mint and hally ordered the moscow mule ($12): stoli vodka, ginger beer, and fresh squeezed lemon juice. both really delicious cocktails. \n\nfrom both visits, my favorite pizzas are the margherita, <mark>Honey Pie</mark>, and <mark>New Yorker</mark> and i absolutely loved the sweet nothing cocktail, so good. i didn't care for the <mark>Calamari Fritti</mark>, rosemary garlic fries, or the mastunicola pizza. anyway, i could eat that margherita pizza every day. it's that good. i have to keep telling myself to not order it, just so i can try their other delicious concoctions (i have my eyes on the <mark>Pizza Campari</mark>, <mark>Clam and Garlic</mark>, and proscuitto e pomodorini). hands down, definitely my favorite pizza joint now (sorry grimaldi's). but seriously, award-winning pies, five different pizza ovens, quality ingredients - you're convinced right?\n\nparking is best on the surrounding streets like on casino center blvd (meters take credit cards, yay, but you can only pay hourly at $1/hour) or free valet at the downtown grand (super easy and close). oh, and don't forget your locals discount!! win.", 
            "dude, a gem within the downtown area,  drove into vegas late so we had to find a place to eat before the boozing that wasn't the taco stand or hot dog place. come for the 90's music videos on big ass tv's and stay for the food! the fries are delicious, sprinkled with rosemary <mark>Clam and Garlic</mark>! what!? yum. late night happy hour was a plus,  starts at 12 $3 off signature drinks and $5 craft beers. the hubby says the selection of craft beer is decent, like 3-4 ipas & just a good variety on tap. \"bald ryan\" was a delight as a server and informed us of sunday brunch with live music that we may have to come back and check out! woop woo",

            "pizza rock is off the chart great pizza.  anytime i'm anywhere near downtown vegas, i suggest it as our dining choice.\n\nmy favorite pizza by far is the sausage and stout pizza -- it was introduced around st. patrick's day last march and hadn't been printed on the menu the last time i was in (mid-july) - but i'm hoping it has now.  absolutely amazing.\n\nmy next fave is the <mark>Honey Pie</mark> - it's the perfect combination of sweet and hot with a mixture of honey <mark>Sausage and Peppers</mark>...really good if you like a little kick in your mouth after a bite.\n\nmy friends ordered the <mark>Tomato Pie</mark> on our last visit (not being as adventurous for spice as i am) and it was also great -- very traditionally italian tasting.\n\ni've also had the mac & cheese, <mark>Fried Green Beans</mark> <mark>Clam and Garlic</mark> bread on other visits...so i can highly recommend those.  i wish i could recommend other items, but i love the above three so much that they're all i can ever bring myself to order!\n\nreally looking forward to the opening of the next restaurant in green valley because it's about 15 miles closer to my house!",

            "was invited here for a friends birthday. never even heard of the place, but was told it was great. after having the food i will have to agree. it's a great place that encourages sharing your food. order 3 or 4 different pizzas and everyone gets to try a different type of pizza. i had the <mark>Clam and Garlic</mark> pizza. just amazing. they've also got one with arugula that was equally amazing. this place is awesome, you owe it to yourself to come here. oh yeah, there's beer too. lots of it.",

            "finally stopped in here after hearing so much about their meatballs and pizza. it was friday evening so they were pretty busy...but i found a seat at the bar and thus skipped the wait list. started with an order of three meatballs, and they definitely lived up to the hype!  i had no problem downing them and all the sauce they came in.  i only wished i had some garlic bread to go along with them.  garlic bread is on the menu, but i decided to try that on my next visit.  i needed to leave a little room for some pizza.  i decided to get a single slice of pepperoni pizza from the take-out counter up front, and brought that back to the bar.  the slice was huge, however i was not impressed...it was way too greasy for my taste.  perhaps i need to go back and order one of the small pizzas off the menu and try that?!  but more likely i will not get past <mark>The Butcher 'All Meat'</mark> (<mark>Clam and Garlic</mark> bread)!",

            "i've now been to pizza rock twice. first things first, why not 5 stars? basically because i've been here twice and i have never been told that locals receive 20% off their bill. what the heck pizza rock? i don't typically go around asking, hey can i get a local discount? but. when i've been here twice and sung its praises to people - and yet, i've been able to get 20% off but haven't? arg. that ruffles my feathers.\n\non to what is good. happy hour is awesome. personal pizzas, apps, well drinks, and cocktails all on the cheap. my friends and i came here during hh and split all three of the personal pizzas and shared <mark>The Butcher 'All Meat'</mark>. okay. i'm no meatball expert but i think these are delicious. meaty, not bready, and the sauce it comes with compliments very well. i also like that these meatballs are simple. i've had way too many meatballs that have way too much going on with them. another reason i like them: you can cut them down the middle with your fork and they fall away in two pieces, not a bunch of lumpy, gross meat pieces. quality. i think.\n\nother than hh.... i came here with my hubby on a saturday night. luckily they have plenty of 2-top tables so we were seated quickly. service was quick and to the point. our server neither impressed me or upset me so i'll give a neutral rating for service.\n\nwhat we ordered... the <mark>New Yorker</mark> 23. it was the one pizza on the menu i figured my picky (and rather plain-jane) husband would enjoy. the <mark>New Yorker</mark> comes with: sliced mozzarella, <mark><mark>Tomato Sauce</mark></mark>, sliced house link sausage, garlic, pepperoni, ricotta. i asked for the link sausages to be removed and replaced with mushrooms. they were happy to oblige. under the menu it says, \"winner, best traditional, las vegas\". i'm not sure what that means.\n\noverall thoughts on the pizza... i enjoyed it. i love the thin crust style. the mix of cheese and sauce was perfect. pepperoni... okay. the ricotta cheese was an awesome addition, creamy and slightly sweet offsetting the heartiness of the pepperoni <mark>Clam and Garlic</mark>. the flavors were that of a \"normal\" pizza, but with a refinement. i think this was a perfect way to satisfy my more adventurous side and my husband's more traditional side.\n\nfinal decision: mine and my husband's dinner was a bit pricey. although delicious, i would rather go back for the happy hour. hh is your best bet here. and ya, go ahead and throw in the fact you're a local. you'll probably get a discount, unlike me. i'd also be interested in just heading up to the take out window to take a slice to go.\n\nother things i want to go back for:\n\ntheir margherita (only 73 made per day)\n<mark>Clam and Garlic</mark> pizza\n<mark>La Regina</mark> (the gold cup winner)\n<mark>Quail Egg White Rose Potato Guanciale</mark> pizza\n<mark>Cal Italia</mark> (again, this comes as one of the personal pizzas on hh menu and is a foodnetwork winner)\nthe chorizo mussels (app)\nand i would come back again for <mark>The Butcher 'All Meat'</mark>.\n\nlooks, like i'll be making a few return trips. the great thing is, i am so happy there is a good, inventive pizza place so close to where i live now.", 
            "i had no idea locals got 20% off! probably something that they should let the locals know!!! hmmm....\n\nanywho! my fianc\\u00e9 and i came to pizza rock to see what all the hoopla was about! first of all, i totally understand wanting to be downtown by action, but wow i'm not really a fan of the parking situation! they do have limited spaces available right near the restaurant, but mostly you have to find parking in one of the garages around fremont street.\n\nwhen we walked in the front door we were immediately greeted by three hosts. they were all smiling and genuinely seemed to enjoy their job! it was nice to see! we were sat at a nice little table for two within full view of the bar. i'll have to try sitting at the bar next time, everyone looked like they were having fun!\n\nour server was very nice and attentive. she made suggestions since it was our first time. we started off with the garlic garlic bread. yummy!!! it came out piping hot on a bread board. the slices were nice and thick, nicely buttered with chunks of fresh garlic. so much carbs, but ohh so good!\n\nthe pizza we decided to try the <mark>La Regina</mark>. i wanted to try something different since i'm used to eating thin crust pizza. it took about 20-25 minutes to come out, which is typical if you want your pizza nicely cooked. the regina was huge! like a pillow!! it had the right amount of sauce, and the salami and arugula tasted fresh and delicious! i had not one complaint! \n\nagain, our server was very sweet and attentive without being overbearing. she kept my fianc\\u00e9s drink refilled, and made sure i was ok with the cider i ordered. my only regret is not leaving room to try dessert! i'll definitely be back to dine at pizza rock again!", 
            "i won't lie - i was skeptical.  how can one place make so many different styles of pizza and make them all well?  \n\nwell, this place has come pretty darn close to achieving that goal.  we had the margherita, <mark>Cal Italia</mark> (proscuitto, fig, balsamic), and <mark>La Regina</mark> (sicilian with picante, mozz, arugula).  notice all the ones we ordered had won some kind of award.  i'm used to margherita not having sauce, this one had sauce on it - but it was delish!  the sauce was slightly acidic and not sweet, which i really enjoyed.  the crust was perfect, just wish the mozz was more spectacular.  the <mark>Cal Italia</mark> had a nice blend of savory and sweet flavors as well as amazing crust.  the <mark>La Regina</mark> was my least favorite, the toppings were a little sparse and i've had better crust. \n\ncool interior, awesome service.  i must be getting elderly as i was complaining to my tablemates about how loud the music was....  but even though i was screaming they couldn't hear me.  not the place for a first date.  get ready to use sign language and stare at the person across/next to you eat while you listen to 80s british and american rock.  music videos included.  \n\ntip: parking is a pain.  just valet it right outside the restaurant at the hotel across the way.  you will probably end up paying the same amount anyway but won't have to walk a block.", 
            "just haaad to try the legend that has become pizza rock, this wonderful italian themed menu has mountains to offer its customers and a warm, friendly front of house hostess'.  but the star of the visit for me was the pizza oven and cook on display and dealing slices out the window, really, really made my heart feel like i was in harlem or somewhere in new york\n \nas for the pizza itself i ordered two pizzas and one burger, a bit of a challenge to get the kitchen to perfectly have the order ready in a professional time, but they were on it four stars alll the way with this restaurant.  downsides were they had no sicilian crust or dough so i could only order their <mark>La Regina</mark> on chicago style an amazing homage to the freshness and taste of chicago.  their american pizza is worth its weight on the menu and could have the stomach to go against the most difficult palate.  don't forget pizza rock on your next trip into downtown las vegas area, grab a slice out the door, or call in an order they are very easy, professional crew.  btw the <mark>Burrata Burger</mark> was the most awesome bacon burger experience of the week.", 
            "this time had the <mark>La Regina</mark>. there was something good in it but the something awful in it ruined it. i don't know which of the cheeses it was. i liked how thick it was but definitely needed more cheese and sauce. ok, i'm going back for a third time, this time for a thin crust. if that doesn't work, i give up", 
            "super delish & awesome service!\n\nwe took the whole family to celebrate hubby and son's bday.  i made a reservation for 6pm, but we ended up arriving at 5:30pm... the hostesses were very sweet and took us right to our table. they even offered to put the cake we brought in their walk-in to keep chilled (it was chocolate with bavarian cream)\n\nour server was summer... she was so nice & welcoming even letting us know about happy hour specials that we had a few minutes to take advantage of. who doesn't love a few bucks off their favorite glass of vino? \n\nsummer was very informative & made great recommendations for our party of 12.  \nwe started with cocktails and appetizers... meatballs, 3 kinds of <mark>Fresh-Cut Italian Fries</mark> (gorgonzola are super yummy!) & grilled prosciutto wrapped asparagus. \nfor our main dish we ordered romana i & ii, ny 22\" pepperoni & sicilian style <mark>La Regina</mark>. my favorite was the romana i, but everything was delicious!  there was so much we were on sensory overload. \n\nwe will be back... so many more pies to try!", 
            "i've been to pizza rock twice, and both times were great. their pizzas are clearly winning awards for a reason! we got the <mark>Cal Italia</mark> (asiago, mozzarella, gorgonzola, fig, prosciutto di parma, parmigiano-reggiano, & balsamic) the first time, and the <mark>La Regina</mark> (sopressata picante, proscuitto de parma, mozzarella, provola, parmaigiano, piave, arugula) the second. both pizzas were really delicious. the <mark>La Regina</mark> is big, with a delicious thick crust; we shared one pizza between four of us and didn't quite finish it. \n\nfun atmosphere, great pizza, huge beer list -- i'll definitely be back next time i'm in vegas!", 
            "maybe we went on an off day, but that's no excuse. service was bad and slow. we were sat before a party and they took their drink and food order first. they did redeem themselves with the wonderful <mark>La Regina</mark> pizza. i would gladly go again for the pizza and hope to get better and faster service."

            "mock service started this week with free food as they iron out the kinks in opening a brand new restaurant/bar. the decor is very cool and urban, with high ceilings and good music playing through pretty awesome sounding speakers, but it wasnt too loud.  i sat at the bar and liked how there was a good view of a tv no matter where you sat, but there werent too many tvs to make it feel like a sports book or anything. i liked the open view of the kitchen and pizza oven as well.\n\nstarted out with a sweet nothing to drink and it was superb. highly recommend it. it combines strawberry, basil, <mark>Balsamic Reduction</mark>....yum. my buddy has a moscow mule and i heard it was perfect too\n\nfor an appetizer i had <mark>The Butcher 'All Meat'</mark>. they were very good and flavorful. \n\nfor the main course we ordered the barrata burger, <mark>The Mob Boss</mark> pizza and the margarita pizza as well.\nour favorite of those was <mark>The Mob Boss</mark>, which had an amazing crust (thick and crispy) and generous toppings: red & yellow peppers, pepperoni, <mark>House Made Honey and Calabrese Sausage</mark>, and salami. wowsa...it would have been a $32 pizza but well worth it. 12 big slices of deliciousness. \nthe barrata burger was juicy and was very good too. i heard they were still tweaking it and even if it doesnt get any better, its really good. \nthe margarita pizza was very amazimg...and the crust was great as well. it is enough for at least 2 people. overall the place was nice, service was excellent, and i look forward to coming back many more times.", 
            "we scored one of the 73 famous margherita pizzas. apparently, they haven't gained in popularity so they have yet to sell out. get one while you can. if you're interested in a traditional margherita, this is a great pizza. i thought the flavor was good but the center was a little limp and soggy. \n\nwhile the margherita was good, what stole my heart was the quail egg pizza.  it was perfectly crispy and delicious. it was just all around unique and had a great flavor profile.\n\nlast note: \n<mark>Mob Museum Special</mark> - <mark>The Mob Boss</mark> pizza + 2 tickets to the mob museum = $36. tickets to the mob museum for two are about this price. this is a great deal if you're planning to check out the mob museum. it's definitely worth a trip.", 
            "made a same-day 7:45p reservation on a friday and ended up getting there 30 mins early & waited about 15 mins and they sat us.  park at the downtown grand like the website says - just a short walk.  got a few bottled beers from the bar for the wait - decent beer selections & appreciated the $4 prices for some of the bottles.\n\nlots of tvs - this was a march madness weekend - yet the four tvs in our line of site all had the same game on where there were at least 3 other games going.  even when the sole game on went to halftime the screens weren't changed.  when that game ended, the screens were finally changed so two different games were on.\n\npizza rock has coke products - yea! ordered meatballs for appetizer and \"<mark>The Mob Boss</mark>\" sicilian for our party of 3 to share. fyi - they will take items off their pizza but won't substitute other items.  \n\nmeatballs were excellent.  tried to order a second appetizer after <mark>The Butcher 'All Meat'</mark> came to the table; took forever for server to come back to table and our garlic bread order came to table after the pizza.  \n\nmenu was huge and complex and could have had more detail.  some pizzas are 12\" and some are 16\"; some are thin crust and some are 1.5\" thick crust and some are served square.  why not put all of this on the menu?  the server explained each pizza type but it was confusing trying to remember which pizza was what size.\n\nour sicilian pizza was quite good.  after the first bite, we realized something was off - some of the toppings were cold, while the crust was hot.  when our server came back to the table, i asked if there were topping added to the pizza after it was cooked and she said yes.  from what i could determine, all of the vegetable toppings were cold - added to the pizza after it came out of the oven.  we had asked for no green peppers and no olives, would have been even more cold toppings without leaving these off.  didn't affect the flavor of the pizza too much.  never had pizza like this before.\n\nthe garlic bread was excellent.  it was served with huge side of marinara.\n\nwe took home more than half of the pizza.  can't wait for leftovers - i can heat all of the toppings.\n\nhuge wait for tables when we left. make a reservation, if you have the opportunity.  we'll be back.", 
            "pizza was delicious. we ordered <mark>The Mob Boss</mark>. it was a deep dish pizza with the works. we also had meatballs which was also very good. will definitely be back to try other dishes.\n\nthe service was great and the late hours is a great idea.", 
            "stumbled upon this pizza joint after having some drinks on fremont so we decided to stop in. parking is either is any of the garages or on the street which is metered except on sundays and holidays.\n\nour first encounter was a group of us ordering pizza by the slice at the entrance since the restaurant itself was closed (late night). it won us over for sure!\n\nour second trip here we came for dinner and got to sit in the restaurant this time around. very nicely decorated inside, tables galore! bar is in the back of the restaurant surrounded by televisions everywhere. bathroom was nice too.\n\nthe service was great, we wanted to customize our pizza order a bit so our server pointed us in the right direction as to the type of pizza we were looking for so that it didn't cost us an arm and a leg. she was prompt at filling drinks as well!\n\nwe were already sold on the classic pepperoni pizza from our first visit so we ordered that, <mark>The Mob Boss</mark> 32 and the <mark>Classic Meatballs</mark> (a must try, the sauce is delicious)! everything came out so fresh and hot! i thought it was cool that they carry 2 sized of bottled coke. :)\n\nsome of their pizzas can get pricey but if you stick to the basics, it'll be fine!\n\ngreat pizza joint! the classic pepperoni reminds me of pizza back home on the east coast! give it a try!", 
            "we came here on a thursday evening and ordered \n1. <mark>Calamari Fritti</mark>, 13\n- traditional or calabrese style with calabrese aioli and marinara dipping sauces \n2. american  original - downtown, 20 \n- mozzarella, pepperoni, molinari salami, bacon, sahhlots, mushrooms, red onions, bell peppers, <mark>Black Olives</mark>, <mark><mark>Extra Cheese, Pepperoni, or Italian Fennel Sausage</mark></mark>, <mark><mark>Cherry Tomato</mark></mark>\n3. soda, unlimited refills, 3\nfor 7 (used the living social deal - $29 for $8 beer, antipasti, and pizza (excludes ny22\")\n\n- parking is pretty lame. we tried binions because they have free parking with validation, but they took out the validation next the cashiers! fail. so there practically isn't anymore free parking on the strip. you gotta eat at their restaurant or actively gamble. $8 for 1.5hrs. shiet...\n- got in around 9pm, seated in a few minutes. sat in the back, next to the bar, right next to a speaker, great place to have a screaming conversation.\n- ran out of sicilian style dough. just our luck. \"just served the last one 15 min ago.\" i guess if we came earlier, we wouldn't have had to deal with that problem. we actually wanted to order <mark>The Mob Boss</mark> pizza instead because the crust is thicker with sicilian style. i'm not much of a fan of \"the potato chip like pizza\" or should i say thin crust. haha \n-because we sat next to a speaker, our server, chelsei, couldn't really hear us over the music. after several ahem, excuse meess....one of them got through, and she handed us utensils and napkins after we got our antipasti. who eats calamari with a fork and towel anyway? haha. come on now...anyway, she was very good at drink refills and attentive thereafter. \n- the calamari was great. we got it half and half. i recommend it bc after i ate a few spicy, i needed to balance it out with one regular. spicy one or calabrese style tasted better. chelsei hooked it up with dat extra dip doe. haha. needed that for the extra dunkers na mmm saying. lol. \n- the downtown was fresh. loved the <mark><mark>Cherry Tomato</mark></mark>, so red. 6 slices. didn't like the uncooked onions. peeled off. wood fire pizza nom! \n\nbreak down of the living social deal...\n- so if you choose the most expensive antipasti, which is  the calamari at $13 and the most expensive pizza, romana, at $35, get the beer $8, then technically, you can get the saving at 48%. \n- i probably should have just saved the deal for another day and just used the yelp check-in promo of 15% off.",

            "amazing pizza! we got a sicilian pizza, <mark>The Mob Boss</mark>, and it was like a supreme pizza on steroids. it was huge and can definitely easily feed 5 or more people depending on how hungry everyone is. absolutely delicious.\n\nwe went on a friday night so they were pretty busy. i went with a group of 8 and we were seated in less than 10 minutes. one side of the table ordered <mark>The Mob Boss</mark> and the other side of the table ordered like a thin crusted pepperoni with mozzarella. their pizza came out at least 15 minutes before ours... i would have preferred them coming out at the same time. our pizza was ginormous and so good though that it was well worth the wait. \n\npizza rock has a great atmosphere too! they had this large random front end of a truck in the restaurant and there was a dj in the driver's seat playing music all night. he was playing some great throwbacks so we were very entertained while waiting for our pizza. \n\ni checked in on yelp at got 15% off the bill for us! our server was nice and was more than happy to apply the discount. the drinks were part of happy hour so it didn't discount from that but it saved us some money on our pizza. love yelp check in specials!! \n\ni'll definitely be back and will recommend this place for some bomb pizza. awesome place downtown!", 
            "loud music!!!\n\nthat's pretty much what i remember from my recent trip here. eight of us came to celebrate a friend's birthday, but it wasn't a great place to talk to everyone and catch up. we were literally yelling just to talk to person next to us. i think by the end of the meal we all gave up on talking to each other and just stared at the tvs playing music videos instead. in general the whole restaurant is very loud, but i think we were directly under a speaker, making it even worse. on the plus side, they were at least playing good music!  \n\nas for the food, the pizza was just \"meh\".  five of us split <mark>The Mob Boss</mark>, which is a sicilian style pizza. the menu said serves up to 5 people and it did for us girls, but if you're really hungry, i would say it's good for more like 3 people. the pizza comes in a big rectangular pan and has super thick crust. i feel like too many pieces had more crust than topping which was disappointing. \n\nthis place has just about every style of pizza one could dream of, so i'd be willing to try another kind. i'm sure there's got to be better pizzas than the sicilian on the menu.", 
            "i've eaten at pizza rock three times already, so i thought maybe it was about time give a review...this place, without a doubt is serving some of the best pies in las vegas. i live in henderson, so i rarely venture downtown unless friends or family are in town (you know how hawaii folks love their downtown casinos). but this place is pretty easy to get into, just valet at the downtown grand. walk through and out the side of the casino, and there it is right across the street (be sure to get valet ticket validated at the restaurant, so parking free).\n\nmy new absolute favorite pizza is their <mark>Cal Italia</mark>, topped with a mix of my favorite italian cheeses (including gorgonzola, yum!), a nice handful of prosciutto, fig preserve, and finished with a spiral of balsamic sauce. it's a perfect concoction of tastes i like, the hint of sweet with the savory. the crust, awesome with the right amount of crunch.\n\nother pizza i've tried...<mark>The Mob Boss</mark>, thick and crunchy awesomeness. the garlic with clams pizza, tasty, loaded with lots of garlic and the single clam in the shell on each slice is a nice touch (tip: don't eat the shell...). the romana #2, large served on a board with 3 different pizzas...<mark>Extra Cheese, Pepperoni, or Italian Fennel Sausage</mark> <mark>Mac and Cheese</mark> on one side, a sweet pesto in the middle, and a pepperoni, with sweet peppers and topped with fresh basil. all delicious.\n\nbesides the outstanding pizza, they also serve some really good pasta dishes. i brought my parents here, my dad had the lasagna and said it was the best he had ever had...<mark>The Butcher 'All Meat'</mark> are amazingly juicy and tasty...the <mark>Mac and Cheese</mark>, forget about it, it's got bacon in it! cheesy, porky goodness...\n\nso, after all i've told you, all you want is a salad? got you covered, the caesar salad is legit, or try the arugula salad topped with a heap of bacon (or was it pancetta?)...or maybe spring for the salumi formaggio (spelling?) board, my wife's favorite. a selection of sliced meats <mark>Mac and Cheese</mark>, fig preserve and candied walnuts.\n\nso, overall...great experience, prices in line for what you're getting. so what if the music's too loud, i think it's great they have dj booth built inside the cab of an 18 wheeler!...i mean, who does that? come on people, try something new, get out of your comfort zone, put down that greasy, congealed slice of pepperoni pizza from the \"hut\" you're used too. me, i can't wait to go back...i hear they just opened second pizza rock at gvr, so now i won't have to wait until family's in town. thanks pizza rock!",

            "pizza, atmosphere, music = 4 stars & great (overpriced though)! service is another matter = 2 stars with a sever too cool for school, & kind of rude.  we sat at the bar and bartender (our server) acted like she couldn't be bothered. we came from a concert at the smith center and would have loved kinder service. prices kind of high here as well. for same pizza in chicago and at a cool place not a dive, \ncost is $14.50 for a 16inch, chez, sausage, cracker thin crust. here, the pizza is a ridiculously high $ 23.00.  sure, i'll go back for the <mark>Sam Giancana</mark> pizza and pray not to get the same service. after all, it's very hard to find chi town type pizza in las vegas.\n\n\nupdated!!  8-10-14:  changed review from 4 stars to 1.  would give it zero if i could. went last week with a party of four to have pizza and the pizza was the worst i have ever had; & being from chicago, i fancy myself as a pizza expert. my usual, the <mark>Sam Giancana</mark>, was terrible!  ordered a large. it came out burned... not just sort of crunchy, but burned!!! it was dry, black on the sides & bottom, burnt!! i said to the waitress,  \"you're serving this with pride??!!! please serve us another as this pizza is terribly burnt\". she did, thankfully. but alas, the second pie was burned!!!!! again!!!!! could  not believe it!!! we tried to eat a few slices, but left almost half the pizza. when asked if we wanted to box the rest, i declined, and was disgusted. i always either finish the pie, or take the rest (good pizza is even better cold).  i didn't complain further, because why bother, knowing this was just a vulgar display of bad service and bad food. i can't believe this place is as trendy and busy as it is. tourist trap for sure.  in my first review, i discuss the bad bartender service. here, the awful food. just because you're in the now trendy downtown district, you shouldn't take it for granted that you might have discerning customers!!!!!!!   your pizza is indeed like eating pizza rock.  just look at the pictures customers are posting!!!!!!! 99% of them all the crust has a lot of black, burnt edges. that is not chicago, or good pizza people!!!!!!!  that is burnt pizza that is dry & overcooked!!!!!!  hellloooooooo.  being a newer restaurant, doesn't give you card blanche to rip people off. and that is what you are doing, ripping people off! shame shame. god help gvr. (hear they are opening a branch there. dumb move gvr).  i for one, will not be back or recommend. surely, you'll close with food and service like this! how couldn't you!!???!", 
            "\"this might be the greatest pizza place i've ever been to.\" -dutch boyd \n\nmy boyfriend loves this place. i am glad i took him. we had the <mark>Sam Giancana</mark> pizza. the sausage was like nothing i had ever had. such a delightful taste. the atmosphere was relaxed with several screens with sports on. i think this place would be really fun to watch the game. the pizza are pretty large, i think 3 people would be happy with ordering just one. they also have appetizers and desserts, but we didn't get to try them this trip. the have a happy hour menu too, but i forget the times. if you are downtown and have a craving for pizza check this place out, you won't regret it.", 
            "it was a beautiful sunday morning. we had some errands to do, so we decided to go for an early lunch at this place. as we walked in, we were greeted by two very peppy hosts that were more than happy to get us to our table asap. without having to wait 5 minutes, our server came over and took our drink orders (2 iced teas and a coke). barely 3 minutes, we get drinks. she immediately asked if we were ready to order and we said yes. we ordered calamari, which was perfect (not rubbery at all and lightly breaded), the <mark>Michigan Ave</mark> ( paper thin crust. yum!) , and the <mark>Sam Giancana</mark> (also delicious). after finishing our meals, they were carefully and courteously boxed (the pizza, as we had finished the calamari). and got the bill, which was not too expensive because of the food and wonderful service. the atmosphere was great. an up-and-coming band called holes and hearts played music most of the time we were there, only stopping to take a drink of water. they were amazing. it was not packed much, as it was 11:30, but still great. i only wished that this place had more business in the morning, as they deserve it. this concludes my review.", 
            "little did i know, the rock part of the name does not refer to what they cook the pizza on, but the actual ambience and theme of the place. it is rock n' roll themed, complete with a live vj the night i went. the vj of the night played a lot of songs from the 90s, and it was actually really cool to see how they inspired the current songs. however, this makes for a rather loud experience, and we could barely talk to each other during dinner.\n\nwe got the famous margherita pizza, and a sausage pizza (the <mark>Sam Giancana</mark>). the pizzas were decent -- each of us had our own preference, mine being the margherita. the crust was thin and chewy, and the <mark><mark>Tomato Sauce</mark></mark> was delicious. i would just mop up the <mark><mark>Tomato Sauce</mark></mark> on its own.\n\nhowever, combining the service, ambiance, and food, it's not really worth the price. it's like you're paying your way into a very, very expensive frat party."

            "when downtown check out pizza rock. pizzas are available in a wide variety of crusts and toppings. our favorite so far is the thin crust <mark>Old Chicago</mark>. it has great sauce and excellent meats. \nservice was friendly and fast. four people feasted and there was enough left to take home.  drink discounts available during happy hour. music was a little loud but did not affect table conversation.", 
            "tasty <mark>Classic Meatballs</mark>, and...\n\n5-stars for the chicago cracker thin pizza. this is the only pizza to get here imo! i've had it twice now over the course of 3 separate visits. \n\ngetting the chicago cracker thin '<mark>Old Chicago</mark>' style means it comes with: <mark><mark>Tomato Sauce</mark></mark>, mozzarella, provolone, garlic, <mark>Extra Cheese, Pepperoni, or Italian Fennel Sausage</mark>, sliced meatballs, ricotta, romano and oregano. perfect! the cracker-thin crust is spot-on and just like my favorite hole-in-the-wall pizza joint near midway airport in chicago. it comes out perfectly toasty and savory, and cut into squares as it should be. you will not feel stuffed, just satisfied.\n\nif you're up in the air as to which style pizza to get because there are so many to choose from, you gotta pick the chicago cracker thin pizza. walking through the restaurant on the way to the men's restroom and back, i wish everyone had a chicago cracker thin pizza on their pizza racks instead of the more traditional pies they chose. from the looks of it, the average person likes bready pizza with pepperoni on it. or at least that's what they think they like.\n\nchicago cracker thin. the only way i rock pizza rock.", 
            "great pizza! if you are looking for a great new restaurant to try in downtown vegas, look no further than pizza rock which is attached to the new downtown grand. the atmosphere is pretty cool and the servers are fantastic. our server told us all about the specials going on. he also talked about yelp specifically, mentioning the discount you get if you check in. we got the <mark>Old Chicago</mark> pizza which was phenomenal. they also have a great late happy hour with $3 well drinks. the well bourbon is very good. overall this was a great experience and will definitely recommend and return often.", 
            "back again and same great service as last time. <mark>Old Chicago</mark>, margherita, and <mark>Cal Italia</mark> were all great and tim m. was great with our large group.", 
            "our party of 6 enjoyed the <mark>New Yorker</mark>, the downtown, and the <mark>Old Chicago</mark>. 3 different styles, there was something for everyone!  come in a group so you can try a variety. everyone had a different favorite but mine was the <mark>Old Chicago</mark>, thin crust and slices of meatball <mark>Mac and Cheese</mark>. yum!\nthe live singer was outstanding.", 
            "ordered an <mark>Old Chicago</mark> style cracker thin pizza cooked in a brick oven. the pie had <mark><mark>Tomato Sauce</mark></mark>, mozzarella, provolone, sliced meat ball, garlic, ricotta, romano and oregano.\n\nit was the first time i ever found a true chicago pizza outside chitown. the four different cheeses blended phenomenal together. each slice had a small ball of ricotta on top that melts in your mouth.\n\nreasonably priced with a great craft beer list.", 
            "i've had the pleasure of dining at pizza rock quite a few times and for the most part they are pretty good. they are a bit on the pricey side and service can be spotty, but the food is always on point and delivered hot and fresh to your table. the interior is pretty cool, it is large and open, there is even a semi-truck on the inside!\n\ni'm a big fan of the <mark>Old Chicago</mark> pizza, <mark>The Butcher 'All Meat'</mark> are delicious and the fresh ricotta is creamy and melts in your mouth. the cal-italia is an interesting choice if you are in the mood for something a bit sweet. all of the ingredients work really well together, despite sounding a bit odd. i've also tried the <mark>Burrata Burger</mark> and while it was a good burger i think that burrata is too delicate to melt on a burger. it's a cheese that you need to eat alone to really appreciate the flavor. i've also had their <mark>Meatball Sub</mark> and while i wasn't a huge fan of the bun, <mark>The Butcher 'All Meat'</mark> were flavorful and delicious. the rosemary and <mark>Sea Salt</mark> garlic fries are a pretty good side as well.\n\nthey also have a counter right inside the door where you can grab a quick slice. i've spent many lunch breaks perched at the counter with a slice. again, it's a bit pricey, but the slices are huge and you can try a variety of toppings. \n\ni think that pizza rock is a great addition to downtown. it's great for big groups and it's nice to have an artisan pizza restaurant within walking distance from work.", 
            "was referred to this place by a friend.  ordered the <mark>Old Chicago</mark> which is something i wouldn't normally order because it is a thin crust pizza. this pizza changed my views on thin crust, it too can be awesome!!  the pie was thin and crispy with top notch ingredients, and great flavors!!! i will be coming here again....possibly as soon as my next pizza craving!!!", 
            "went here on a friday night with a group of 6 friends after very briefly doing the fremont-tourist-thing. i had been dying to give this place a try since, after living in chicago for 5 years, vegas pizza had sucked balls, on the whole. \n\nwe ordered the <mark>Cal Italia</mark>, and the <mark>Old Chicago</mark>, because fuck yes chicago cracker crust. we also ordered a third pizza that never showed, but was only briefly missed. the other two were so wonderful...i almost don't have anything to say because, yeah, perfect pizza. perfect. crust, perfect. sauces, perfect. balance, ridiculously perfect. ugh, i want some right now.\n\nwaitress was awesome; attentive, informative, helpful, and not hovering, and the place was packed, so i do not hold the missing pie (which we were never charged for, either) against anyone. super kind to one of my tourist friends, whose accent makes her pronunciation of things like \"prosciutto\" a source of embarrassment quite often. we felt utterly welcome and had a truly happiness-enducing meal.\n\n my only gripe was the noise level, which was pitched just above \"easy conversation\" range. that's to be expected at fremont on a friday, but not my bag. will try it on a different night to see if the levels change.\n\nit's a little on the pricey side for pizza, but i find i really don't care. it's so good i am happy to pay a little bit extra for pizza i truly enjoy. i will just go all rhett butler on my budget and remind it i don't give a damn. it's cheap for actually sating the great pizza itch. \n\nmy favorite pizza in vegas, so far by miles. that cracker crust. yessss. will be back as soon and as often as i can manage.", 
            "the skinny: awesome happy hour however the regular dinner items were only okay (3.5) service: pretty good for a pizza joint although it wasn't particularly busy when we went (4) value: amazing happy hour for the price while regular dining is a bit pricey for what it is (3.5 round up to a 4 starred review).\n\nnote about the parking: do not go inside the casino for validated parking. just park in the the grand self-parking lot across the street and the hostess at pizza rock will give you a sticker to put on your parking ticket for free parking. score!\n\nafter visiting twice, i have decided i do like pizza rock.\n\nthe first visit for dinner, i wasn't terribly impressed. we ordered the <mark>Old Chicago</mark> cracker thin crust pizza and a <mark>House Salad</mark>. \n\nthe <mark>Old Chicago</mark> pizza was okay but nothing i needed to order again. specifically, the crust is very burnt on the edges of the pizza which was off-putting. although the sausage/pepperoni/ricotta cheese combination was good, the pizza felt that it was missing something... like a hit of mushroom to kind of unify all the flavors. it was a bit greasy as well.\n\nthe <mark>House Salad</mark> is rather small with a very generic tasting balsamic dressing on top. for $6, i'd pass on this.\n\nenticed by the happy hour prices, we decided hit this joint again. we ordered the personal pizza sized molinari and the <mark>Cal Italia</mark> for $7 each and tried the <mark>Fried Green Beans</mark> for $3 and fried calamari for $5.\n\nthe <mark>Fried Green Beans</mark> were pretty good. they are not fried per se but sauteed lightly with a lot of garlic. for those who are watching their waistlines, the amount of oil on the bottom of the bowl is intimidating however. for $3, the serving size is quite generous.\n\nthe fried calamari was delicious! the calamari was soft and tender while the breading was appropriately on the lighter side. portion size was rather large. you can get this dish in either the spicy version/non-spicy version or even half and half. personally, i found the spicy version to be a little too strong for my tastes so i'll stick to the regular version.\n\nthe pizza crust was very good - slightly chewy with a nice crispy bottom which was a good change from the burnt crust on their ol' chicago.\n\nfor me, the <mark>Cal Italia</mark> was only okay - a bit too sweet due to the figs and <mark>Balsamic Reduction</mark> and needs a bit more of the gorgonzola and proscuitto to balance things out. i almost wished they hadn't reduced the balsamic vinegar to retain a bit more of the acidity to the dish.\n\nthe molinari was a great old school pizza - it's basically what they call everybody's favourite back home in canada (sausage and mushroom). the crust and sauce was great and everything just went well together. some may think that it is a little greasy (which it is - no doubt) but that comes with the territory when you serve  3 types of sausage on a pizza. so good and totally guilty pleasure.\n\noverall, this joint has a lot going for it - the variety on the menu is good and the happy hour deals are excellent. although some of the items are hit or miss, the molinari and fried calamari will have me coming back for sure. service is good if you are going during off peak hours/days (we went happy hour during the week and sunday evening at 5:30pm). overall 3.5 starred review with a bump up to 4.", 
            "my new mod to the '<mark>Old Chicago</mark>' cracker thin - add the tri-color bell peppers and boom - a new fave. still a big fan of this place. happy hour is a deal on meatballs and string beans, so fill up on those if you're just snacking.\n\nfood here is still as consistent as ever. \ntheir beer selection has gotten pretty good, too.", 
            "we've been dying to try this place out and we finally got around to it with two good friends. \n\nnone of us have been here before so we were ready to dig into some pizza or \"za\" as my boyfriend would call it. \n\nwe all ordered a round of blue moons and each shared two pizzas. my boyfriend and i got the <mark>Cal Italia</mark> which had challenge asiago, mozzarella, imported gorgonzola, sweet fig preserve, prosciutto di parma, parmigiano-reggiano, <mark>Balsamic Reduction</mark>. after our first bite, our tastebuds were roaring, it was delicious and a must try! \n\nwe also tried <mark>Old Chicago</mark>, which was very thin crust with <mark><mark>Tomato Sauce</mark></mark> mozzarella, provolone, sliced \nmeatballs, garlic, ricotta, romano, oregano. this one was okay, but we much rather had more of the <mark>Cal Italia</mark>! \n\noverall, pizza rock gets four thumbs up from us!",

            "we've come here a handful of times since they opened. tonight we had a party of 6, as my family was in town. we ordered the <mark>Old Chicago</mark> and a bud light beer tower. the pizza was amazing!!! cesar salad and several martinis. our waiter was so great! each time a plate was dirty he was super attentive about clearing our table. at one point my fianc\\u00e9 (whos had a few at this point) asked our waiter for a small pinch of fennel. to clear an argument/bet with my cousin. chris, the waiter went into the back and brought us a pinch in a small dish!!! so amazing and kind of him even though it was totally unnecessary as the boys were being ridiculous lol. chris kudos to you!! you made pizza rock over the top amazing tonight! coming back just to see u!",

            "i went to pizza rock with high expectations, based on some articles and reviews i had read, and the fact that it features international award-winning pizza.  but,  unfortunately, those expectations were not entirely met.\n\nitalian wedding soup was very good spicy and hearty soup, but nothing like traditional italian wedding soup.  it was more like minestrone with medium-sized meatballs, carrots, celery, tomatoes, ditalini noodles, and basil.  i was mostly pleased with a <mark>Classic Caesar</mark> salad that sported a good light caesar dressing with a little kick to it and a little sour flavoring, cold romaine leaves, and lemony pieces of parmesan sheets.  but it was in the all-important pizza department that i was somewhat disappointed.\n\na three cheese & ham pizza with extra cheese was very good except for the parmesan powder tossed on top.  and the internationally recognized margherita pizza was excellent.  no complaints there!  but, with respect to the <mark>New Yorker</mark>, which was voted the best traditional pizza in the world, i felt that the ricotta cheese and <mark><mark>Tomato Sauce</mark></mark> were overpowering and in too much supply, compared with the amount of sliced mozzarella, sliced house link sausage, garlic, <mark>Sausage and Peppers</mark> that shared the stage; and the crust was much thinner than i prefer.  \n\noverall, from my single experience, although the margherita pizza prepared here can definitely hold its own, even in the las vegas valley alone i would rank the other types of pizza i tried here behind dom demarco's, cosmopolitan's secret pizza, metro pizza, settebello's, biaggio's, and enzo's.\n\nthe place has a nice spacious and informal ambiance, although it is rather dark inside.  besides a large bar, white butcher paper is spread on white formica and black-edged tables.  our server allie provided friendly and very helpful service.  \n\nthe pizza sampled here was not at all bad.  it just wasn't as great as i thought it would be.\n\n3-1/2 stars overall!", 
            "i just to had to come back here with my fam especially after sampling some of their goodies from a cmye just days before.\n\nso we started with 3 pretty nice sized meatballs for 6 bucks. should of got the 6 for 10 deal because <mark>The Butcher 'All Meat'</mark> were some of the tastiest chunks of beef i have had in a very long time. the marinara sauce that it sits in might as well have been gold because if i wasn't in a public place and was at home, i would have been licking the bowl clean. we also ordered caesar salad for 10 bucks. it was pretty good but for that price, i thought we could have gotten more.\n\nafter going over the menu, we wanted to try the world famous margherita pizza. here's the actual description from their very own menu:\n*margherita 16\n (limit of 73 made per day) world pizza cup winner naples, italy\n dough hand mixed using san felice flour, proofed in neapolitan wood boxes\n san marzano tomatoes, mozzarella fior di latte, basil, evoo and <mark>Sea Salt</mark>\n\nas quickly as we were excited, our server told us the cold hard truth. there was no more! :( \nso much for our excitement. it does say in limited to 73 per day. what a weird number. i think i will ask next time why.\n\nin the mean time, we decided to go simple and ordered a classic thin crust pepperoni pizza for 14 bucks. this was cooked in a gas brick oven for 550 degrees. this thin crust features <mark><mark>Tomato Sauce</mark></mark>, mozzarella, <mark>Sausage and Peppers</mark>. its so simple that its great.\n\nas a side, i wanted to try their wood fired asparagus for 5  bucks. now this was sheer disappointment. what they give you is like half of what you would get at the supermarket so the portion size was definitely lacking. as for the taste, well lets put it this way, any time you cook vegetables, especially grilling them, you just want to cook it just enough for it to be a little bit crispy still. in this case, it was limp and almost to the point that it was soggy. so yeah, it was overcooked.\n\nservice was on point. we didn't need to ask for anything. refills were constant and we were constantly checked up on.\n\nthe only negatives that stood out for me was the limp asparagus and the music being played. i loved what they were playing but i thought the volume was a bit loud. i only bring this up because even though my wife sat across from me, after our first conversation after sitting down, we had to repeat just about every other word. as i looked around, it didn't seem like anybody else was being bothered by it so i just left it alone.\n\noverall, i am definitely coming back here for great pizza <mark>Spaghetti and Meatballs</mark>. i just wouldn't recommend ordering the asparagus and hopefully the music is not as loud next visit.\n\nyelp 2014 365 review challenge #23", 
            "great food, great service, awesome atmosphere!!  i love going to freemont with my vegas fam.  there are so many \"hidden\" gems.  i feel sorry for those that go to vegas and never venture the newly renovated freemont experience.  i believe the owner of zappos put in quite a bit of money to give some new life to this beaten up part of town, and let me just say, he did an amazing job!!  more of that in my other location reviews.  \n\nwent here before a night of bar hoping.  we ordered the picante pizza and a romana that included the parmesan/proscuitto/arugula section, the nutella/apple/walnut section, and the sausauge(?) and some other meat that i can't think of section.  we already ordered the regular calamari and the spicy calamari.  the picante lived up to it's name!  but it was so delicious.  it included chorizo, cholula hot sauce, jalapenos, <mark>Sausage and Peppers</mark>.  highly recommend it if you like spicy food.  the 2nd pizza was amazing and really big.  all 3 sections were so good.  great crust and great combination of toppings.  my favorite though had to be the calamari!  i love calamari but not every restaurant that carries it should serve it.  pizza rock calamari rocks!\n\nthe service was fast, efficient and friendly.  our server took the time to explain the different pizza options (yes there are tons: new york, chicago, california, italian, flatbread, focaccia, etc).  also, the decor and ambience was very fitting of the downtown area.  they actually have the cab of a peterbuilt big rig in their restaurant and looks pretty cool.  it would look cooler if it were painted like optimus prime, but that's just my geek opinion. definitely recommend you pay a visit and be prepared to have some out of this world pizza!", 
            "pizza rock is off the chart great pizza.  anytime i'm anywhere near downtown vegas, i suggest it as our dining choice.\n\nmy favorite pizza by far is the sausage and stout pizza -- it was introduced around st. patrick's day last march and hadn't been printed on the menu the last time i was in (mid-july) - but i'm hoping it has now.  absolutely amazing.\n\nmy next fave is the <mark>Honey Pie</mark> - it's the perfect combination of sweet and hot with a mixture of honey <mark>Sausage and Peppers</mark>...really good if you like a little kick in your mouth after a bite.\n\nmy friends ordered the <mark>Tomato Pie</mark> on our last visit (not being as adventurous for spice as i am) and it was also great -- very traditionally italian tasting.\n\ni've also had the mac & cheese, <mark>Fried Green Beans</mark> <mark>Clam and Garlic</mark> bread on other visits...so i can highly recommend those.  i wish i could recommend other items, but i love the above three so much that they're all i can ever bring myself to order!\n\nreally looking forward to the opening of the next restaurant in green valley because it's about 15 miles closer to my house!", 
            "my wife and i went to a play in downtown las vegas.  i had been to pizza rock for two yelp events and i decided to come back for a quick dinner and try some more of their good things.\n\nwe started with an order of three meatballs.  they were very good and the <mark><mark>Tomato Sauce</mark></mark> was great.  i took the serving spoon and ate some of the leftover sauce like soup.\n\nfor our main course, we opted to split a stromboli. we got the romano's original 1950.  it had cheeses, <mark>Extra Cheese, Pepperoni, or Italian Fennel Sausage</mark>, and sweet peppers.  the crust was thin which is a plus but the interior was missing some filling.  the <mark>Sausage and Peppers</mark> was meager.  there was a lot of cheese inside and the stromboli was good.\n\nwe were pressed for time.  our server, shani, knowing this, brought our check before we were done so paying and getting to our show was easy.  in fact, we arrived at the show 15 minutes early.\n\na big criticism i have is the loud, loud music.  at 6:15, they cranked up the volume to just one decibel under now you have to shout to be heard.  is this really necessary?  when i checked their website, i got the same blast of music and i learned to mute my computer before looking at their site.  too bad we didn't have a volume control at the table.\n\ni may be back, but if i do return, it will be at an earlier hour when they have lower music--i hope.", 
            "stopped by pizza rock after the color run with the kiddos.  they said 45 min wait but it ended up being less then 10.  we were seated next to the truck.  my son loved that.  the menu is huge, so many different types and styles of pizza.  it can be almost overwhelming trying to pick.  i got the brooklyn calzone deep fried and the kiddos all got kids meals (mac n cheese, <mark>Spaghetti and Meatballs</mark> <mark>Sausage and Peppers</mark> pizza).  i choose the calzone because i had never heard of one deep fried before.  the filling was good but i wouldn't pick deep fried again.  the crust was very thin and crunchy.  not what i was expecting.  glad i tried something new though.  all the kids meal were very good and included a drink.  they were large portions and could have been shared.  my kids never want the same thing though.  they give the kids crayons to color and draw.  that's nice to keep them busy.  service was great and they were packed.   def a great family friendly place downtown.", 
            "great food, great service! sommer was awesome and very attentive. described the menu in detail and was very accommodating. the food itself was top notch. the kobe beef burger was cooked perfectly and the rosemary fries weren't overbearing at all. perfect seasoned. the pizza i got was by the slice up front. the <mark>Picante</mark> favors melded perfectly together. take a bite of the chorizo and the ricotta at the same time. crazy result. the pizza of the day was <mark>Sausage and Peppers</mark>. can't go wrong with that. music was good and provided a rock style atmosphere. can't wait to come back!", 
            "yummmy!\nanywhere that has a good home cooked italian feel to it will always be a favorite of mine! \ni had the <mark>Sausage and Peppers</mark> and my mom has the chicken parm.\n<mark>Sausage and Peppers</mark> came in a bowl with a lot of peppers and onions (my fav!) and some <mark>Extra Cheese, Pepperoni, or Italian Fennel Sausage</mark> with a side of home made focaccia bread.\nchicken parm also came in a bowl accompanied by a bed a homemade pasta.\n\nour server was great, and two managers stopped by for table touches. i love the hands on feel you get from everyone!\n\ni always come back for the edgy feel and great food.", 
            "i'm a fan of the pizza window here at pizza rock. when you walk inside, towards your right you can buy pizza by the slice. to the left of that is the hostess stand and dining area. the line was short on one visit and longer on the next. they really move the line through nicely. they have some stools at the counter to the right of the register where you order, but it's a tight space and there isn't a lot of seating. i just plan on popping in and grabbing my slices to-go when i come here. i like that they offer the typical cheese ($4) <mark>Sausage and Peppers</mark> ($4.50) slices as well as a different \"slice of the day\" ($6) each day. the slices are huge. you can't beat the price, portion or quality. i tried some sicilian cheese and it wasn't bad, but could have been more crispy on the bottom instead of being a tad too soggy. i'd still give it another try during another visit. \n\nthey offer a variety of pizzas baked at a variety of temperatures here at pizza rock. i plan of trying most of them. the menu says only 73 of pizza champ tony's award winning margherita pizzas are made per day. there are actually other pizzas that are made in limited amounts each day, but the margherita is a favorite. i'd call ahead if you are interested in any of the limited batch pizzas. unless you are meeting a group of people here i'd just call your order in anyway for pick-up to avoid the parking hassles of downtown and have someone drop you off to grab your order. the pizza window is currently open until around midnight sun - thurs and until around 2 am on friday and saturday.", 
            "best pizza i've ever had! had the <mark>New Yorker</mark> ($23) which features mozzarella, ricotta, sausage, <mark>Sausage and Peppers</mark>. the sausage was absolutely delicious and the mini pepperoni were nice and crisp. the sauce compliments the meat flavors well and the ricotta cheese just rounds everything off. the 6 slices were fairly large and the pizza itself was 16\". also ordered the hazelnut kiwi pizza ($13) since they have a special brunch menu on sunday's. it had peanut butter, nutella, some sort of jam, strawberries, fuji apples, and bananas. it was more of a dessert type of pizza. recommend for kids but not really a meal. overall a wonderful meal and highly recommend. \n\n*note: don't park at the lot right adjacent to the restaurant! that lot charges $20 for 1 hour of parking. find parking at a hotel for much cheaper.", 
            "so let me start out by saying we were previously at hogs and heifers on freemont street, and while walking back to the car i had to have pizza.\n\ni can't remember the pie we ordered but it had <mark>Sausage and Peppers</mark> on it. it was the best pizza i have ever had in my entire life.\n\ni have been dreaming of the pizza since sunday night, and i know i'll be dragging my husband back over there soon.\n\nwell done, pizza rock. our first pie since moving to las vegas and it was amazing.", 
            "a vey solid pizza joint in the heart of downtown vegas! pizza rock is just a block off of fremont, so when your done eating it's a easy access to your fremont experience. we tried three different pies ranging from the <mark>New Yorker</mark>, to a sicilian, and a <mark>Classic Pepperoni or Cheese</mark>. the <mark>New Yorker</mark> was classic thin with ricotta cheese <mark>House Made Honey and Calabrese Sausage</mark> <mark>Sausage and Peppers</mark>! the cheese was thin crust and maybe the winner of the night for just a solid, good, perfectly cooked pie! the sicilian was very good as well, with a good deep dish dough and miniature <mark>Pepperoni</mark>! you can get a large variety of pizza styles here ranging from chicago deep dish, to new york thin crust, and more creative gourmet styles! my one knock on this place is that it is way over priced! in vegas where there are a few great pizza joints, with vegas style prices, this place definitely hits the high mark with our three pies and sodas topping the $100 plateau! this southern gentleman enjoyed his meal, loved the decor of the restaurant, loved the proximity to fremont, but probably wouldn't come back due to the extreme prices! at the same time i certainly would encourage you to try it out as it is a tasty pie!"

            "this place is perfect for the group of people who each want a different style of pizza. thin, new york, sicilian, whatever... they'll have it plus different electric and wood ovens to boot. their extensive menu can be overwhelming for those that are indecisive, like me. so, it's best to peruse the menu ahead of time or just let someone else order. the <mark>Cal Italia</mark> ($18) was the best pizza i tried with its rich flavors from the sweetness of the figs to the savoriness of the prociutto. i also enjoyed the <mark>Quail Egg White Rose Potato Guanciale</mark> ($18) even though i'm typically not crazy about spicy foods. the roma iii ($32) is great if you're in the mood for an appetizer, entree, and dessert pie all in one. although the middle section with the <mark>White Cream Sauce</mark> <mark>Spaghetti and Meatballs</mark> was the main standout for me. not so impressive were the margherita ($16) and farmer's market (pumpkin puree, cinnamon, marshmallow). our group even had room for dessert. the <mark>Pecan Turnover</mark> and apple calzone more than satisfied my sweet tooth. the <mark>Mud Pie</mark>, after chiseling away at it, was a letdown. it only succeeded in making me feel guilty for consuming all those calories. so, while dishes were hit or miss, there's enough promise to warrant a return visit.\n\n3.5 stars", 
            "so its time to update my last review for pizza rock.  i must say once i posted my last yelp review  the owner, trevor responded to me immediately-within hours of the post.  he was entirely all over the issue, asking for details and assured me that all issues would be addressed which is all that i had hoped for. \n \nmy second visit was quite the opposite of my last experience and i was anticipating some kind of issues.  first off,  it was new years eve and second we had a reservation for a party of 12.  we started out with 10 people and added 2 more the day before with no problem.  when we arrived a few of us went to the bar to order a drink anticipating  to wait a little bit before being seated.  the bartender (i didn't get his name) was more than helpful and a very cool guy with corona shaped new years glasses. ;)   amazingly we were seated within 5 minutes as the other people around us were looking at over an hour wait-because they didn't have reservations.  i highly recommend the reservations-especially on a major holiday.  immediately we were greeted by our server anisa with a smile and excitement that we were there and she was ready to help us in any way possible.  i must say i was greatly surprised at the service we received with all the factors i mentioned above.  anisa was both personable and attentive that we hardly realized that she was serving other several tables.  a simple thing that makes you a super server-unfortunately not everyone can have that talent.   drinks were flowing and we all ordered with 3 or 4 split checks without any issues.  for 5 of us we ordered the <mark>New Yorker</mark> and the <mark>Cal Italia</mark> pizzas.  the <mark>New Yorker</mark> is the most amazing pizza i have ever had...that is what we ordered the last time so you know it has to be good.  it is topped with sausage and little <mark>Pepperoni</mark>....but my favorite part was the super creamy ricotta strategically placed on top where you could spread it around with your fork to savor a little on every bite.  yum.  the <mark>Cal Italia</mark> had prosciutto and a balsalmic drizzle  that had a flavor like none other.  seriously between the two pizzas we were 100% satisfied and all was gone except for one slice in the end.  not too bad for 5 people.  others ordered <mark>Spaghetti and Meatballs</mark> (it was gigantic), lasagna (which my man said he may have to order next time-it looked fabulous), the romana  ii (which gives you a little variety and its big enough to share).  everyone was very happy with their food and we left full and tipsy. =)\n\nnow we did have a small incident where one of my guests spilled a whole glass of ice water all over me.  it could have been worse right??   anisa, even though it wasn't their fault, comp'ed us a pizza just for the inconvenience which was definitely not expected by any means.  we definitely were pleased with  our server so much that we will ask for her the next time we visit.\n\nall i can say is finally some good quality food downtown.  we've been waiting a long time for some good eats out there.  you can bet that's where we will be eating while we are down there.  thank you trevor, for listening to my concerns and working out the kinks.  i believe an honorable owner is one that listens to the customer and strives to correct the issues no matter how big or small they may be.  and thanks to anisa for making our new years eve dinner a special one to remember.  happy new year pizza rock - my new years resolution is to see you often in 2014.  cheers!", 
            "2 thumbs up! if i had 3 thumbs, that one would be up too! after reading the reviews, i decided to give it a try - and since i was staying right across the street at the grand, it was super convenient. \n\nnice atmosphere, tons of tv's to catch the games and the food - really, really good. be prepared though - the portions are gigantic! you'd better be really hungry - lol.\n\ni usually don't go to the same restaurant when i'm on business trips but i ended up going two nights in a row - it was that good. first night was <mark>Spaghetti and Meatballs</mark>  - <mark>The Butcher 'All Meat'</mark> are fantastic. they actually got better the more i ate. second night was  chicken vesuvio and mashed potatoes - damn good! drinks are on the pricey side but the bartender does them right. and when you are done stuffing yourself silly, fremont experience is a block away so you can go walk it all off!\n\noverall, i would certainly recommend pizza rock and will most definitely come back when i come out to vegas again!",

            "pizza rock is one of the newest additions to downtown 3rd, located right across the street from the brand spanking new downtown grand.\n\nnot quite sure where the best place to park is for free parking. i ended up going to the binion's garage (free 3 hour parking with validation). it's just a short walk away (1 block).\n\na sunday brunch stroll in was welcoming. not too busy, friendly staff. we decided to start off with the salumi & <mark>Salumi & Formaggio Board</mark> and a margherita pizza, which apparently is a signature pizza they're proud of. ended the meal with a tiramisu dessert.\n\nsalumi & <mark>Salumi & Formaggio Board</mark>: assorted meats <mark>Mac and Cheese</mark>, candied walnuts, focaccia toast and fig jam. i enjoyed this. one of the lighter options to start off your meal.\n\nmargherita pizza: the pizza was quite tasty. you can tell they used some great ingredients in this. split between 2 people, this pizza satisfied us, but it's not a heavy pizza. the ravenous might want to go for one of the heftier pizza options.\n\ntiramisu: really tasty and creamy, served in a glass. not a huge dessert, but makes for a good closing. \n\nall in all, a great experience here. one thing i noticed on the way out is that they have weekly specials that use ingredients purchased at the downtown 3rd <mark>Farmers Market</mark>. i'm going to have to give those a try on my next go around. there are also huge tvs located at every corner which made it great for us to watch the football game during our meal.", 
            "i really wish i could give this place a higher star rating but perhaps i will be back another time to change it.\n\nit wasn't that the food as bad, although my <mark>Meatball Sub</mark> came out lukewarm, it wasn't the bad service even though i got the sense the waitress wasn't thrilled to have to wait on a table that had three younger children, it was the process in which the food was delivered and the awkwardness of watching everyone else at other tables who came in after us got served first.\n\nall we ordered was one <mark>Meatball Sub</mark>, one order of <mark>Mac and Cheese</mark>, one p, b and j pizza from the kids meal (which was oddly a cheese pizza with peanut butter and jelly) and one <mark>3 Cheese Roll</mark>.  \n\nthe food took forever to come, and it came one thing at a time, really slowly.  first the <mark>Mac and Cheese</mark> for one of my sons, then the pizza, then the <mark>3 Cheese Roll</mark>, and then 5 minutes later my <mark>Meatball Sub</mark>.  the fact that it was lukewarm probably says that it was actually sitting there waiting for someone to get it.  \n\nthis sounds like a discombobulated communication error on the side of the kitchen staff and the runners/waitstaff.\n\ni did get 20% off for checking in, but overall i was left less than impressed.  perhaps i will give it another chance, or perhaps i will just stick with my standbys and let the zappos folk flock to it and be catered to since it's hip for them.", 
            "okay. i love pizza, for many reasons, and this place is my late night, kinda drunk and super hungry so i can only be satisfied from a slice from here before i go home pizza place. it is everything i love about a great slice. it's a huge portion, i can taste all the ingredients so perfectly. great crust <mark>Mac and Cheese</mark> and the pepperoni is different in a good way, small and spicy. the cooks that work up front are soo fun too! they are never annoyed with us, even though we can be a rowdy bunch sometimes. they are patient and treat us great. my personal favorite about this place is that they sell coke-cola in a bottle. that is a huge plus! last time i was there i may or may not have been offered a meatball on a fork. well, i was and it was delicious.", 
            "i ordered the <mark>Burrata Burger</mark> medium well, which comes with arugula, bacon <mark>Mac and Cheese</mark>, on pretzel bun. also came with thruffle fries. the meat was a little bland maybe not enough seasoning or salt in the meat. burger was well portioned that it was actually to big for me. i couldn't finish it. (that's how big it was) well as a first timer i need to come back here and try the pizza.", 
            "***check-in and get 15% off your whole meal!***\n\ni found a deal on living social for $29 for 1 craft beer, 1 appetizer, and 1 pizza to share. it was well worth it!!  the total for this portion of our bill was $54!  \n\nwhen we walked in, this place had a nice vibe. the music was a great selection and it was the perfect volume.  we were sat near the bar, but asked to move, so we didn't have to sit on bar stool level table and chairs.  they were very accommodating and moved us no problem. \n\nof course we all ordered beers.  they have a nice selection of drafts, and an even bigger selection of bottles. \n\nwe ordered the salumi & <mark>Salumi & Formaggio Board</mark> for our appetizer. the menu describes it as - assorted salumi & formaggio, fig jam, spicy candied walnuts, rosemary focaccia toast.  it was very good and is a nice bite for 2-4 people. unfortunately, we were so hungry, i forgot to get a picture of it. :p\n\nthen for the pizza, we decided to get our money's worth of the coupon i had and ordered the biggest pizza we could.  lol! \nwe chose the romano ii. it was divided into three section with three different toppings. all three were delicious!  the pizza was thin and crispy and there were plenty of toppings <mark>Mac and Cheese</mark>. \nhere's how the menu describes it...section 1: <mark><mark>Tomato Sauce</mark></mark>, natural casing pepperoni, <mark><mark>Extra Cheese, Pepperoni, or Italian Fennel Sausage</mark></mark>; section 2: pesto, <mark><mark>Caramelized Onions</mark></mark>, <mark>Goat Cheese</mark>, <mark>Roasted Tomatoes</mark>, garlic; section 3: ricotta, garlic, basil, linguisa, <mark>Piquante Peppers</mark>\nsection 1 was perfect for that typical man \"meat lovers\" pizza. section 2 was unique with the sweetness of the <mark><mark>Caramelized Onions</mark></mark> and saltiness of the <mark>Goat Cheese</mark>.  section 3 was my favorite, even though i think they forgot the ricotta. i loved the sweetness of the <mark>Piquante Peppers</mark> (like a roasted red pepper), and the linguisa is very similar to their pepperoni. \n\nduring our meal the gm came over and asked us how we were enjoying it and even told us all about the business, from the encouragement of my aussie friend. \n\nwould definitely go back and will!!!", 
            "went there 07/12/2014, before a 51's game. ordered <mark>Mac and Cheese</mark> for my daughter, which she liked and a burger for myself. the burger was obviously frozen, it came out dry and hard. no time to complain as the food took almost 20 minutes to arrive and we had a ballgame to go to. i would hate to be there when it is busy, i imagine the wait time for food could be much longer.\nservice could have been better, but waitress was nice. if a pizza place is going to serve burgers, they should be decent. mine was terrible, i would not go back",

            "we tried the margherita, <mark>New Yorker</mark>, and <mark>Cal Italia</mark>.  personally, i like the antipasti <mark>Classic Meatballs</mark>.  \n\nthe service was poor at best.  i realize it was packed so they don't get one more star taken off.  we never had water without asking and when we did ask they ignored us.  what really cost them points is seeing others come in after us get their pizza before us.  our 7 year old was already done with her <mark>Mac and Cheese</mark> before they came to check on us, only to realize we hadn't eaten.\n\nit wouldn't have been so bad if we weren't there for a birthday dinner.  the manager was sent over, he apologized and said he would put in a rush and make something special.  well all the pizzas came out burnt.  the rock hard crust had me gasping for air or water to wash it down only when i reached for the water... you guessed it, i didn't have any.\n\none last chance, happy birthday song...  nope they were too busy.   \n\nwhen it came time for the check they chraged us for an apple juice which should have come with the kids menu.  live and learn.", 
            "you need to come here! this pizza is delicious and the service is great. we visited on a sunday to have dinner with friends. they had gone the day before and absolutely had to go back ( that says tons in itself). we were not drinking so we had las vegas coolers which were refreshing and not overwhelmingly sweet. we decided on the <mark>New Yorker</mark> and the <mark>Frank Nitti</mark>. the nitti has thin crispy crust with just the right amount of sauce <mark>Mac and Cheese</mark>. the spinach had good flavor and texture. the ricotta was the perfect touch. the way it was baked was perfect! the ingredients were balanced to let you taste everything on the pizza and not focus on one ingredient particularly. the <mark>New Yorker</mark> lived up to its name. the crust was a little thicker and had a great consistency. what stuck me was the sausage. such a distinct fresh flavor!!! amazing... the sauce to cheese ratio was perfect. <mark>The Butcher 'All Meat'</mark> were all delicious and generous throughout the pie. come here tell your friends to come here!!! i never say that in reviews but the food and service most definitely warrant. next trip to vegas will definitely include this pizza.", 
            "was here judging the world food championships and several other judges told me to go have a slice here and i would love it. boy, they weren't kidding!\n\ni'm a pizza snob for sure. born in ny and raised in la. but mostly only had great pizza in ny. there are actually a few good places here in sd too. \n\nbut that slice i got from here was off the charts good! even though the toppings were great, the crust was the star! crispy, yet chewy with a slightly sweet flavor that just made all the toppings pop. \n\ni got it topped with purple potatoes, prosciutto, feta and pesto. wowza! even loved the taste of the oils running all over it! yes, $6 is a lot for one slice, but it was totally worth it. the pepperoni <mark>Mac and Cheese</mark> is only $4. i just went with fancy schmancy! \n\ni will def be back next time i'm here!", 
            "while i've been here more since my last review in june, i went twice last week because the person i was with had not been there yet. after the first time, we were back the very next day.  we had the <mark>New Yorker</mark> the first day which was <mark>Extra Cheese, Pepperoni, or Italian Fennel Sausage</mark>, and ricotta dollops on it. amazing!  i'm actually starting to like the thinner crust more and more each time i visit.  no need for me to divulge in thick crust.   the second day, he got the same pizza, and i had the chicken parmesan. the chicken was cooked perfectly, the crust around it was crispy and perfect, sauce <mark>Mac and Cheese</mark> all delish. the only thing i didn't like was the bucatini pasta under it. it's quite thick and either wasn't cooked long enough, or that's just how it is...either way, i wasn't a fan so if i do order that again, i'll go for a different type of pasta.", 
            "this is our 3 time eating here in 2 day! the pizza is phenomenal! the <mark>New Yorker</mark> and the downtown are masterpieces! great beers! great staff. the music sucks only because i hate most new lazy hipster rock that's out. i seriously want to work here to find out how they make the damn pizza then quit and make it at home for myself. oh and the <mark>Mac and Cheese</mark> were to die for.", 
            "i've eaten at pizza rock three times already, so i thought maybe it was about time give a review...this place, without a doubt is serving some of the best pies in las vegas. i live in henderson, so i rarely venture downtown unless friends or family are in town (you know how hawaii folks love their downtown casinos). but this place is pretty easy to get into, just valet at the downtown grand. walk through and out the side of the casino, and there it is right across the street (be sure to get valet ticket validated at the restaurant, so parking free).\n\nmy new absolute favorite pizza is their <mark>Cal Italia</mark>, topped with a mix of my favorite italian cheeses (including gorgonzola, yum!), a nice handful of prosciutto, fig preserve, and finished with a spiral of balsamic sauce. it's a perfect concoction of tastes i like, the hint of sweet with the savory. the crust, awesome with the right amount of crunch.\n\nother pizza i've tried...<mark>The Mob Boss</mark>, thick and crunchy awesomeness. the garlic with clams pizza, tasty, loaded with lots of garlic and the single clam in the shell on each slice is a nice touch (tip: don't eat the shell...). the romana #2, large served on a board with 3 different pizzas...<mark>Extra Cheese, Pepperoni, or Italian Fennel Sausage</mark> <mark>Mac and Cheese</mark> on one side, a sweet pesto in the middle, and a pepperoni, with sweet peppers and topped with fresh basil. all delicious.\n\nbesides the outstanding pizza, they also serve some really good pasta dishes. i brought my parents here, my dad had the lasagna and said it was the best he had ever had...<mark>The Butcher 'All Meat'</mark> are amazingly juicy and tasty...the <mark>Mac and Cheese</mark>, forget about it, it's got bacon in it! cheesy, porky goodness...\n\nso, after all i've told you, all you want is a salad? got you covered, the caesar salad is legit, or try the arugula salad topped with a heap of bacon (or was it pancetta?)...or maybe spring for the salumi formaggio (spelling?) board, my wife's favorite. a selection of sliced meats <mark>Mac and Cheese</mark>, fig preserve and candied walnuts.\n\nso, overall...great experience, prices in line for what you're getting. so what if the music's too loud, i think it's great they have dj booth built inside the cab of an 18 wheeler!...i mean, who does that? come on people, try something new, get out of your comfort zone, put down that greasy, congealed slice of pepperoni pizza from the \"hut\" you're used too. me, i can't wait to go back...i hear they just opened second pizza rock at gvr, so now i won't have to wait until family's in town. thanks pizza rock!", 
            "randomly decided to try pizza rock as we were preparing to leave the fremont area and am so glad we did! amazing! great atmosphere, service, light music and the food was outstanding. we actually didn't have pizza but some brunch items, macaroni <mark>Mac and Cheese</mark> and my little has the kids spaghetti and meatball. all was way better than expected. new favorite spot for sure.", 
            "i start this review by letting everyone know that i was the idiot that went to a pizza place and did not order pizza. \n\nsince i was staying nearby on a business trip i decided to give pizza rock a try after seeing lots of good reviews. unfortunately for a single person their pizzas were too large and i wasn't able to take any back with me. instead i ordered a <mark>House Salad</mark> and meat <mark>Mac and Cheese</mark> board. the salad was a salad, nothing special to report. i've ordered lots of charcuterie <mark>Mac and Cheese</mark> boards before and let me tell you the portions of prosciutto, cheeses, and salami were huge! not to mention there were two massive pieces of bread. it was safe to say i barely put a dent in it. \n\nthe bartender was super nice and let me know they do personal pizza for happy hour m-f 3-6 & 10-12 (i wish i would have known sooner). i'd love to come back and try a pie because they look amazing. next time...", 
            "pizza rock was highly recommended by three locals. if locals say it is good i take their word for it. they have a very reasonably priced meat <mark>Mac and Cheese</mark> board. the marinara pizza is a great choice for people who aren't the biggest fans of overly cheesed pizza. the service was spot on.\n\nthey restaurany wasn't overly flashy. a good place to watch a game. yelp does have a check in offer. \n\npizza rock had some darn good pizza!"

            "ok, i've eaten her about a dozen times since my first visit, and i'm still a fan. some of my favs that i'd like to recommend are <mark>The Butcher 'All Meat'</mark>, which i guess is made in house, not shipped frozen. the <mark>Cal Italia</mark> pizza which they won a food network award for. and the <mark>Burrata Burger</mark>. you've gotta try these!", 
            "i'm a huge fan of tony gemingani so it was only a matter of time, with me being a frequent visitor to vegas, that i would visit pizza rock over in downtown vegas. \n\nthe menu is virtually the same from tony's pizza napolitana in sf.  it includes his famous award winning margherita which is cooked in under 2 minutes along with his vast assortment of pizzas from ny style, romana, california style, and gluten-free.  and it also includes his famous meatballs and pasta dishes as well.  don't forget to check out his burgers too.\n\nsame menu, different setting and in this case, a very different setting where instead of the traditional italian restaurant look from tony's in sf, it's more of a heavy metal rock theme inside here which is quite fitting for vegas actually.  that being said, the pizza is really top notch.  and although i've been to tony's in sf a few times, there are still a lot of things on the menu that i still haven't tried.  my friends and i decided on their <mark>Cal Italia</mark> and the <mark>Honey Pie</mark>.\n\n<mark>Cal Italia</mark> -- http://bit.ly/1bgftsf\ngold medal winner - food network pizza champions challenge\nasiago, mozzarella, imported gorgonzola, sweet fig preserve, prosciutto di parma, \nparmigiano-reggiano, <mark>Balsamic Reduction</mark> \nalthough i've been to tony's three times, this is actually my first time trying his prize winning <mark>Cal Italia</mark>.  it's a very interesting pie in both looks and flavor.  very sweet and savory from the figs and balsamic and prosciutto.  i really dug this pie and would definitely order it again next time i come back to either here or at tony's in sf.\n\n<mark>Honey Pie</mark> -- http://bit.ly/1kbvpvu\nquail hollow farm honey, calabrese peppers, <mark>Green Onions</mark>, mozzarella, piave cheese, \nfried <mark><mark>Caramelized Onions</mark></mark>, serrano peppers\ni've had this pie before at tony's in sf and i ordered it again to share with my friends in vegas so they can try it for the first time.  it's a very unusual pie that has a very sweet and savory flavor with a little spicy kick to it.  if you've ever had a deep fried wonton at a chinese restaurant and dip it in sweet and sour sauce, that's probably the most similar taste that i can compare this pizza to.  although the caramelized fried onions were a little burned, it still tasted delicious.  but for some reason, i wasn't tasting the honey.\n\none honorable mention i recommend from is their <mark>Burrata Burger</mark>.  i didn't have this at pizza rock but i've had it at tony's in sf.  i think it's very underrated because it's almost always overshadowed by the pizzas and everything else.  you get a 1/2 lb burger with burrata cheese and crispy prosciutto and it comes with a generous pile of parmesan garlic fries  (http://bit.ly/1epxy9t). definitely worth trying out!  \n\ni think what i like best is that the wait time at pizza rock is considerably shorter than it's older bother in sf where the wait time for a table can be at the least close to 2 hours.  though that could change if good word of mouth goes around.  it looks like pizza rock is off to a great start and with its extensive menu and popularity growing, i can see it doing very well in downtown vegas.", 
            "just haaad to try the legend that has become pizza rock, this wonderful italian themed menu has mountains to offer its customers and a warm, friendly front of house hostess'.  but the star of the visit for me was the pizza oven and cook on display and dealing slices out the window, really, really made my heart feel like i was in harlem or somewhere in new york\n \nas for the pizza itself i ordered two pizzas and one burger, a bit of a challenge to get the kitchen to perfectly have the order ready in a professional time, but they were on it four stars alll the way with this restaurant.  downsides were they had no sicilian crust or dough so i could only order their <mark>La Regina</mark> on chicago style an amazing homage to the freshness and taste of chicago.  their american pizza is worth its weight on the menu and could have the stomach to go against the most difficult palate.  don't forget pizza rock on your next trip into downtown las vegas area, grab a slice out the door, or call in an order they are very easy, professional crew.  btw the <mark>Burrata Burger</mark> was the most awesome bacon burger experience of the week.", 
            "just had lunch here this sat around 1:30 in the afternoon. we went here bcuz my daughters coworker knows she goes to vegas every month and keeps asking \"did you get to eat there yet?\" we finally made it not impressed at all. the hostess was polite and sat us really fast, the atmosphere and decor were great, and we had a good waitress. the problem was the food it was just ordinary. i had the kobe beef <mark>Burrata Burger</mark>, the beef was cooked exactly as ordered the flavors just werent there and it was greasy, i like my bacon crispy it was limp, the fries were tasty, my daughter had a pizza that was just ok.  but nothing that i would ever feel the need to go back for. the prices were good. parking was easy just parked in the binions lot and had it validated.", 
            "i ordered the <mark>Burrata Burger</mark> medium well, which comes with arugula, bacon <mark>Mac and Cheese</mark>, on pretzel bun. also came with thruffle fries. the meat was a little bland maybe not enough seasoning or salt in the meat. burger was well portioned that it was actually to big for me. i couldn't finish it. (that's how big it was) well as a first timer i need to come back here and try the pizza.", 
            "this is now my second run-in with pizza made (or rather associated with) tony gemignani. he's well known in san francisco for being a world pizza champion and owner of tony's pizza napoletana. my first experience consisted of a long wait, which was all i could recall. i guess the pizza was less than memorable. \n\na local b-list celebrity chef opening a spruced up rock-themed pizza joint in vegas? why do i have a feeling this is a setup for failure. it's just a feeling. first, the good. i like the concept of offering different styles of pizza made from different oven types. they are very temperature specific ranging from the hottest wood-fired oven, an electric brick oven, and down to a gas brick oven. the <mark>Cal Italia</mark>, made from the latter oven was a winner for me. it was also crowned the winner of the food network pizza champions challenge. the crust was perfect - lightly crispy on top with a mostly chewy consistency. the sweet fig preserve and <mark>Balsamic Reduction</mark> paired with the prosciutto and parmigiano-reggiano was a home run. \n\nthe bad. the menu is way too large. i tried the <mark>Burrata Burger</mark>, which was awfully salty with the bacon mixed into the patty. i could barely taste any of the burrata due to the over seasoning. <mark>The Butcher 'All Meat'</mark> and truffle fries were average.\n\nthe ugly. the margherita, the supposed world pizza cup winner, was burnt to the point where we had to ask the waitress to return it. i know my pizza and the occasional blistering of the crust, but this was beyond that. it was black all around as well as burnt black flour underneath. all i could taste was the bitterness of the charred crust and of regret. a wood fire pizza cannot sit in a 900 degree oven very long. the saving grace was a very apologetic and helpful waitress. \n\ni like the large space and the fact that there's a big rig in the middle of the restaurant, but the atmosphere cannot entice me to return. for a city that prides itself on offering free parking in most places, the downtown parking situation was abysmal. street parking was minimal and most of the offerings around pizza rock were at one of the local hotels that offered valet (free only with validation). oh, i also happened to use the restroom before leaving and witnessed a guy vomiting and retching profusely in the stall next to me. to be fair, i cannot say if it was from the food or the alcohol. let's just leave it at that.", 
            "i finally checked out the <mark>Burrata Burger</mark> (kobe, burrata, arugla) at pizza rock. it got a very high rating from that fraud who runs the vegas burger website. i should've known better than to trust that guy's judgment.\n\nin one word: forgettable.\n\nin more than one word: dry, short on flavor, unbalanced, and the bun was a touch stale.\n\nbottom line: this is an overpriced, and overpraised burger.\n\ncompared to the less expensive, and infinitely better burgers at fat choy and rollin' smoke, the pizza rock burger is a non-starter. \n\nso i didn't finish it.", 
            "i've had the pleasure of dining at pizza rock quite a few times and for the most part they are pretty good. they are a bit on the pricey side and service can be spotty, but the food is always on point and delivered hot and fresh to your table. the interior is pretty cool, it is large and open, there is even a semi-truck on the inside!\n\ni'm a big fan of the <mark>Old Chicago</mark> pizza, <mark>The Butcher 'All Meat'</mark> are delicious and the fresh ricotta is creamy and melts in your mouth. the cal-italia is an interesting choice if you are in the mood for something a bit sweet. all of the ingredients work really well together, despite sounding a bit odd. i've also tried the <mark>Burrata Burger</mark> and while it was a good burger i think that burrata is too delicate to melt on a burger. it's a cheese that you need to eat alone to really appreciate the flavor. i've also had their <mark>Meatball Sub</mark> and while i wasn't a huge fan of the bun, <mark>The Butcher 'All Meat'</mark> were flavorful and delicious. the rosemary and <mark>Sea Salt</mark> garlic fries are a pretty good side as well.\n\nthey also have a counter right inside the door where you can grab a quick slice. i've spent many lunch breaks perched at the counter with a slice. again, it's a bit pricey, but the slices are huge and you can try a variety of toppings. \n\ni think that pizza rock is a great addition to downtown. it's great for big groups and it's nice to have an artisan pizza restaurant within walking distance from work."

            "we were in downtown and wanted to try a new restaurant. i am so happy we found this on yelp! even though it is not on fremont, it is only a quick walk from it. and quite frankly it's worth it since sadly a lot of the food options on fremont is well... not so good.\n\nwe showed up on a saturday evening and was seated shortly afterwards. the decor of this place is a feast for your eyes. i loved the cute pee-pee sign for the restroom! we were seated right next to a semi truck! there were lots of tvs for your viewing pleasure. love the fact that on some of the tvs there were closed captioning. (i would like to know what's happening instead of watching a silent film, well in this case game.)\n\nour server, tim c., was excellent! (he is part of the reason why this place is a 5 star!) we let him know that it was our first time there. he was very thorough in explaining on what was popular. during our meal he came back often to make sure our food was to our satisfaction and if we needed another beer.\n\nas for the food, since we had pizza the night before we decided to have a non-pizza meal. (i know, who goes to a pizza join and not get pizza right?!) i ordered the gorgonzola & apple salad. this hit the spot! love the combination of the gorgonzola and apple with cranberries and walnuts. it was not heavy at all and it was very satisfying. i had a bite of my husband's <mark>Gorgonzola Burger</mark>. it was delicious! the patty was very juicy. and omg can i say their fries that come with it is amazing! they use real garlic and they use a lot of it! really puts some hair on your chest. definitely don't be kissing anyone after that. but definitely eat it!\n\nlooking forward to returning to this place and trying some of their pizzas!\n\nps. use your 15% off your bill with yelp check-in.",

(again, this place is an oasis!)\n\nit is immaculate (uber clean!). and, the waitstaff is insanely helpful/cheery/knowledgeable. how really refreshing! \n\nthe food was sooo tasty! our group shared an order of meatballs, garlic bread, a three-cheese calzone, <mark>Meatball Sub</mark>, and a margherita pizza ... i highly recommend this so that you get to try a little of everything! and, everything single item was a cheesy, delicious delight!\n\nthe prices are on-par with vegas, but the experience easily exceeded our expectations!\n\nif you visit freemont, be certain to go to pizza rock!

            "items selected:\n\nmargherita - 900f wood - napoletana with san marzano, mozzarella, fior di latte, basil, olive oil, <mark>Sea Salt</mark>\ncal-italia - gas brick - asiago, mozzarella, gorgonzola, fig, prosciutto, parmigiano-reggiano, balsamic\n<mark>Quail Egg White Rose Potato Guanciale</mark> - 900f wood - mozzarella, white rose potatoes, chorizo, pork cheek, rosemary, fromage blanc, calabrese peppers, lavender <mark>Sea Salt</mark>\nromana iii - electric brick - prosciutto/arugula/parmigiano, white cream/<mark>Chopped Garlic</mark>/meatball/olive oil, gorgonzola/date/pecan/apple/honey/nutella\nfarmer's market pizza - 900f wood - pumpkin puree, cinnamon, brown sugar, bacon, marshmallow\napple calzone - brown sugar, cinnamon, caramel, vanilla gelato\n<mark>Pecan Turnover</mark> - light puff pastry, maple pecan, crunch, coffee ice cream\n<mark>Mud Pie</mark> - oreo cookie crust, chocolate ganache, coffee vanilla bean ice cream, hot fudge, caramel, house made whipped cream\n \nhaving repeatedly neglected to visit tony's pizza napoletana in san francisco in favor of places like una pizzeria, pizzeria delfina, zero zero, and others i was admittedly intrigued when the well awarded chef opted to set up shop in downtown las vegas at pizza rock - the swanky new digs, multiple televisions, and guitar hero worthy playlist a far cry from the eponymous bay area location even though the multiple oven and top notch sourcing concepts remained intact - and it was with all those things in mind that myself and five others descended on the restaurant for a tasting of sizeable proportions, a total of 4.5 pizzas and three desserts served over the course of just over two hours with hit-and-miss results.  a surprisingly large space, literally big enough to park a truck, it was an early arrival that assured us use of the large private dining room and with excellent service from both the general manager plus an enthusiastic young waiter it would not be long before our pizzas started to arrive and brought out in three separate courses it was with the signatures that we began, the \"limited\" margherita proving cool to the touch and shockingly bland despite both excellent char and chew to the crust while the cal-italia proved far superior with a crunchy, toothsome crust more than able to stand up to a bevy  of toppings both sweet and savory, acidic and creamy.  moving next to the interesting yet overly complicated and entirely too spicy quail egg selection it was at last the \"3-course\" romana with its cracker crisp crust and well-paired toppings that wowed me most - the central third particularly well done with the rich meatballs nicely balanced by light cream and ample garlic, though the sweet selection was certainly not lacking in contrast or flavor either.  moving last to a gifted half of the farmer's market pizza, unfortunately overloaded with cinnamon just as the quail egg had been with spice, and finally to a trio of desserts where only the delicate <mark>Pecan Turnover</mark> would prove either inspired or memorable i think it is safe to say that the key to enjoying a meal at pizza rock is to simply embrace the concept and realize that \"everything to everyone\" and \"do one thing and do it well\" are very different mantras; the former definitely improved by a group of good people, excellent service, and (at least in this case) fond memories of 80's and 90's rock ballads.", 
            "this place is perfect for the group of people who each want a different style of pizza. thin, new york, sicilian, whatever... they'll have it plus different electric and wood ovens to boot. their extensive menu can be overwhelming for those that are indecisive, like me. so, it's best to peruse the menu ahead of time or just let someone else order. the <mark>Cal Italia</mark> ($18) was the best pizza i tried with its rich flavors from the sweetness of the figs to the savoriness of the prociutto. i also enjoyed the <mark>Quail Egg White Rose Potato Guanciale</mark> ($18) even though i'm typically not crazy about spicy foods. the roma iii ($32) is great if you're in the mood for an appetizer, entree, and dessert pie all in one. although the middle section with the <mark>White Cream Sauce</mark> <mark>Spaghetti and Meatballs</mark> was the main standout for me. not so impressive were the margherita ($16) and farmer's market (pumpkin puree, cinnamon, marshmallow). our group even had room for dessert. the <mark>Pecan Turnover</mark> and apple calzone more than satisfied my sweet tooth. the <mark>Mud Pie</mark>, after chiseling away at it, was a letdown. it only succeeded in making me feel guilty for consuming all those calories. so, while dishes were hit or miss, there's enough promise to warrant a return visit.\n\n3.5 stars",

            "this place is perfect for the group of people who each want a different style of pizza. thin, new york, sicilian, whatever... they'll have it plus different electric and wood ovens to boot. their extensive menu can be overwhelming for those that are indecisive, like me. so, it's best to peruse the menu ahead of time or just let someone else order. the <mark>Cal Italia</mark> ($18) was the best pizza i tried with its rich flavors from the sweetness of the figs to the savoriness of the prociutto. i also enjoyed the <mark>Quail Egg White Rose Potato Guanciale</mark> ($18) even though i'm typically not crazy about spicy foods. the roma iii ($32) is great if you're in the mood for an appetizer, entree, and dessert pie all in one. although the middle section with the <mark>White Cream Sauce</mark> <mark>Spaghetti and Meatballs</mark> was the main standout for me. not so impressive were the margherita ($16) and farmer's market (pumpkin puree, cinnamon, marshmallow). our group even had room for dessert. the <mark>Pecan Turnover</mark> and apple calzone more than satisfied my sweet tooth. the <mark>Mud Pie</mark>, after chiseling away at it, was a letdown. it only succeeded in making me feel guilty for consuming all those calories. so, while dishes were hit or miss, there's enough promise to warrant a return visit.\n\n3.5 stars", 
            "pizza overload!  so many different pies...different ovens...different toppings...no time for all that!\n\ncame with a group of yelpers with big appetites, so we were able to blast our way through quite a bit on the menu!\n\nmy favorite by far was the cal-italia ($18): asiago, mozzarella, imported gorgonzola, sweet fig preserve, prosciutto di parma, parmigiano-reggiano & <mark>Balsamic Reduction</mark>. this was excellent and the highlight of the meal for me! great mix of sweet, savory and vinegar/acidic flavors.  highly recommended :)\n\nanother great choice would be the margherita ($16): san marzano tomatoes, mozzarella fior di latte, basil, evoo and <mark>Sea Salt</mark>. honestly, this was probably the first enjoyable margheria i've had! not usually a fan of this style pie.  whatever they do differently here, i enjoyed...but you may not for the same reasons.\n\n<mark>Quail Egg White Rose Potato Guanciale</mark> ($18): mozzarella, white rose potatoes, chorizo, pork cheek, rosemary, fromage blanc, calabrese peppers & lavender <mark>Sea Salt</mark>. this was surprisingly spicy...a bit over the top, but still enjoyable.  order it knowing it's actually spicy, and you'll do just fine.\n\nromana iii ($32): 1) <mark>Sweet Fig Preserves</mark>, prosciutto, gorgonzola & <mark>Balsamic Reduction</mark>. 2) ricotta, garlic, basil, linguisa & <mark>Piquante Peppers</mark>. 3) gorgonzola, dates & pecans, and <mark>Apples, Honey, Nutella</mark>. interesting combinations here...the only one that didn't really satisfy was the middle portion. a bit spendy, but it's huge and serves 2-4 people.  i'd pass on this one next visit.\n\nfor dessert, we also tried quite a bit.  the best imo was the <mark>Pecan Turnover</mark> : light puff pastry, maple pecan, crunch & coffee ice cream. this was pretty tasty...probably the most enjoyable dessert we tried. came out piping hot too...yum :)\n\napple calzone : brown sugar, cinnamon, caramel & vanilla gelato. this is served with 2 calzones...pretty good overall but nothing extraordinary. \n\nmarket pizza : pumpkin puree, cinnamon, brown sugar, bacon & marshmallows. not really my kind of dessert...perhaps if you are a pumpkin lover?\n\n<mark>Mud Pie</mark> : oreo cookie crust, chocolate ganache, coffee vanilla bean ice cream, hot fudge, caramel & house made whipped cream. this was very frozen...hard as a rock. i enjoyed the cookie crust though. \n\nso it's a hit or miss kinda spot for me.  depending on what you order, your results will vary...for better and worse.\n\npics!"
