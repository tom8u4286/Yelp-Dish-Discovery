            "la pasta perfetto!\n\nsometimes the simplest things can be magical when executed perfectly.  this is the case with scarpetta, scott conant's debut into the las vegas restaurant scene.  \n\nthe decor is understated and classy, in shades of black, white and gray.  a knowledgable and unpretentious waitstaff makes the experience all that much better, as they walk you through the menu.  a few tables along the wall rest next to big windows which overlook the neon shimmer of the strip below.  if you're coming here with a small group, definitley request one of these tables.  \n\nadesso, il cibo  (now, the food)\n\n<mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> carpaccio -  four paper-thin slices of <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> treated with fine olive oil and a bit of garlic.  high quality fish and a gentle hand made this appetizer balanced and elegant.\n\nwaygu beef tartare - diced  waygu beef treated in a similar fashion to the <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark>, but with a more pronounced garlic note at the end.  very straightforward and satisfying.\n\nspaghetti marinara - as many have said, this is the best spaghetti you will ever eat.  the housemade al dente spaghetti is toothsome and tender.  somehow, the chefs here are able to pull the purest essence of tomato and basil out in this dish.  the simultaneous subtley and complexity of the flavor profile here is truly incredible.  i've spent a lot of time in italy, and honestly cannot think of a spaghetti that holds a candle to this masterpiece.  a must order!\n\nblack mac n' lobster - i believe the <mark>Black Cod</mark> of the noodles comes from squid ink, but i could be mistaken.  very nice flavors of lobster and the sea.  the texture was quite similar to the spaghetti, which i found to be redundant, but that was an error in my ordering, and nothing to do with the execution of the dish.  \n\nduck and <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark> w/ marsala reduction - the food that kings eat!  the ravioli was immaculate, formed with care and the love you'd expect from a homemade italian meal.  i found the combination of duck, foie gras, and the marsala reduction to be a bit too heavy.  i could see people raving about this dish, but for me it was just too much of a good thing.\n\nbranzino - gentle white fish with a lightly crisped skin and honest flavors.  one of the best cooked fish plates i can remember having.\n\ndry aged filet - the pink/gray color of this steak is visually contradictory to what you might find at a fine steak house, but that is due to the dry aging process.  it was tender, flavorful, and neat.\n\n\nyes the bread is incredible as well, but let's not fill up on bread.  scarpetta is a great date spot if you're looking to splurge.  do not leave without ordering the spaghetti, its the type of dish you'll tell your grandkids about.", 
            "is it bad if you go to a restaurant in vegas that you've been to elsewhere? i don't care. my sister and i went here for an incredible dinner. the service was fantastic. we were seated next to the window so we got to watch the fountains the entire night (contrary to what you might expect i did not get bored watching them over and over again). we started with the polenta w/mushrooms because i love it, the <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark>, which was delicious and super fresh, and the scallops which were awesome. my sister had the infamous spaghetti which she loved (and i did too). my dish was out of control - it is called the black macaroni and if i could eat it all the time i would. it is squid ink pasta (not macaroni) with lobster and basil bread crumbs. i cannot describe how perfect this dish is - or how obsessed i now am with basil bread crumbs. truly amazing. we got the zeppole for dessert. *love* - truly excellent and wonderful - i wasn't expecting this level of awesome. i need to go to the one in nyc now so i can have the trifecta.", 
            "first off, i would have to say scarpetta's service is impeccable.  if we could just rate our waiter alone, we would give him a 5 star rating!  he was knowledgeable, friendly, and humble.  i have seen far too many waiters in vegas who don't care, or are extremely snooty because my husband and i look young even though we're not.  \n\nas for the food, we order the scallops as the appetizer, and the duck and <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark> and the spaghetti as our entree.  for the scallops-i feel that it was good-but i have had better.  the duck and <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark> is their stand out dish!!  the wine reduction and marsala sauce on top of the ravioli made it so delicious.  the actual ravioli themselves are shaped like triangles.  i can tell there that is this delicacy to the outside when they were making it.  the duck and foie gras inside is very unique, and not like anything my husband and i have tasted before.  this dish deserves a 5 star.  finally, for the spaghetti.  i was extremely excited to try this dish because i read all these reviews on <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> explaining that it was amazing.  however, we were a little disappointed maybe because we were expecting so much.  don't get me wrong-the pasta is still good.  however, it's not the amazing that it was made out to be.\n\noverall, if i could give scarpetta a 4 1/2 stars, i would.  my husband and i will definitely be back if when we go back to vegas.", 
            "this is my first ever check-in on <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark>! \ni had a great dining experience at scarpetta. the food was beyond delicious. the service was terrific and the view was breathtaking. we sat right next to the window so we got to watch the bellagio water ballet as we munched on our perfectly cooked pasta and veal medallions. \n\nwe ordered the braised short ribs with farro and the tuna rolls as our starters. the tuna rolls were not impressive but the quality of the tuna was great. the braised short ribs with farro was so good i could've eaten bowls and bowls of it. the beef was flavorful and tender and the farro was cooked to perfection. i wish we ordered another plate of the short ribs because i loved it. i ordered the famous spaghetti and it was one of the best pasta dishes i've ever had. the pasta was so fresh, soft and chewy. it was simple but done perfectly. my friends ordered the tortellini with duck and foie gras, veal medallions and fresh pasta sheets with lobster, garlic and pistachios. everything was delicious. for dessert, we ordered the napoleon with creme brulee and blood orange sorbet. \n\nour server was attentive and not pushy. he also had a great sense of humor.  \n\nit was a great experience over and i would recommend you stop by this place when you're in vegas.", 
            "last stop on the \"cosmo food c<mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> \" \n\nstarting to feel the effects of the c<mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> but we gotta make a final stop for the restaurant that allegedly makes some of the best pasta in the u.s. \n\nagain, sat in the lounge area of the restaurant. while waiting for the table, i tried a few of the chips that are complementary at the bar - very good ! had fried basil blended in with some bite to them - not sure if it was red pepper or not. \n\nwhile we were virtually ignored at comme ca, scarpetta was the other end of the spectrum ( an not in a good way ) - our server was nice but man, way to pushy on trying to up sell, especially the drinks. \n\nwent with lighter wine this time - name escapes me but it was a $10 glass - nice. we also opted for some sparkling water - $9. \n\nordered the spaghetti ( $24 ) , the <mark>Creamy Polenta</mark> with fricasse mushrooms ( $16 ) and the branzino ( sis wanted the cod but the server almost insisted that the branzino was the way to go - she relented - $26 ) \n\nthe spaghetti was a joy - might be tad bit too strong in basil , but it worked for me. what surprised us was a little heat to the sauce - the server was also a little surprised to hear this ... to the point i don't think she believed us. \n\nthe polenta was extremely rich but dang good. the fricasse was better here than the mushrooms we had at comme ca and helped cut through some of the richness of the polenta. \n\nthe branzino was perfectly cooked, simple seasoning but great taste. nice. \n\nwe went with the amedei <mark>Chocolate Cake</mark> ( basically a molton lava cake $11) with a toasted almond gelato and a salted caramel sauce ( the reason why we got it - $3) and then a separate scoop of tangerine sorbet. \n\ni tell ya, that tangerine was a heck of finish to our food fest - so frickin refreshing - i will go back for that every time i'm in the building !!", 
            "one of the best dining experiences in vegas to date.\n\nto start off i must say that our waiter, matt, was amazing.  he was so knowlegeable, friendly, and answered all of our questions.  he really knew the menu well and could give reccomendations with amazing detail.  i loved the staff here.\n\nno joke, that bread basket with trio of citrus infused olive oil, eggplant spread and mascarpone butter...is to die for!  i could live off the stromboli filled with salami and smoked mozzarella.  so delicious.\n\nas a starter, i tried the <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark>.  the presentation was simple and clean with four thin slices of <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> topped with olio di zenzero, microgreens and sea salt.  it was so simple but you could taste the freshness.\n\nfor my next course, i ordered the short rib agnolloti.  perfection.  the brown butter and horseradish sauce was flavorful and had the right amount of kick to pull the dish together.  it was a very small portion but was perfect for a light dinner before going out.  my friends ordered the spaghetti with tomato and basil, <mark>Black Tagliolini</mark>, and orata rossa.  they all enjoyed their meals and the experience at scarpetta.\n\nour amazing waiter matt, surprised our table with a birthday plate of an assortment of italian cookies which were an amazing finish to a great meal.\n\ngreat ambiance, view of the bellagio fountain, service, food...overall an amazing dinner!!", 
            "have i known that this place was known for its spaghetti then i would have gotten it. i just can't see paying $15-25 for spaghetti. \n\nbut the atmosphere of this restaurant is hip & modern-like the hotel itself. our waiter was super friendly and gave us great service as well as the bussers and host. i ordered the blackened cod and my bf ordered the veal, ick..i don't know what veal is supposed to taste like since i haven't had it before but i tasted it and didn't like it. but my blackened cod was really good and we ordered the seared <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> tail for an appe-teaser! omg, it was the best i have ever tasted, i highly recommend this! it had a lemon nutty flavor that just melt in my mouth! so good!! \n\nand they give you bread before your meal, yummy, they had different varieties that you can choose from and trust me all of them are good! \n\ndefinitely would go back but going to try the spaghetti next time..", 
            "cutting edge italian food presented beautifully in the perfect contemporary setting of the cosmo.  \n\nscarpetta's food is about building and layering flavors from a few ingredients to produce a harmonious dish.\n\nfor starters, <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> best.  the tuna \"scusci\" is excellent.  the tartness of the marinated veg pairs perfectly with the fish.  the <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> dish, with its pure simplicity brings out all the subtle sweetness of the fish.  finally the wagyu tartare.  wow, the use of the hazelnuts and parmigianino cheese creates a totally unexpected flavor!  \n\nfor pasta, its gotta be the duck and <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark>.  other <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> said they loved it.  it really is good.  the pasta is perfectly cooked and works well with the sweetness of the marsala reduction.\n\ntop mains include the branzino with pine nuts and green garlic gremolata that totally brings out the naturally nutty flavor of the fish and the pancetta wrapped <mark>Veal Loin</mark>, served with sweetbreads.  the flavors are very subtle and absolutely delicious.\n\nthe wine list is very good with a nice balance of italian wines (not just super tuscans).  vintage depth is ok.  prices are in line with vegas resorts.\n\nservice is very efficient.\n\noverall prices are very good for a restaurant of this caliber.\n\nrecommended.", 
            "great atmosphere fitting for group night out, intimate enough for dates and business dinners alike. beautiful view looking out to the bellagio. \n\nwe ordered:\nprimi...\n<mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> sashimi +++++ (more please!)\ntomatoe mozzarella salad ++++\nscallops +++++\n\npasta...\nspaghetti ++++ (pasta is made daily in house)\n\nsecondi...\n<mark>Spiced Duck Breast</mark> +++ (a bit chewy and star anise overpowered the duck just enough to make it not as enjoyable)\n\nfinished the meal with napoleon creme br\\u00fbl\\u00e9e, and it was just divine.\n\ni had a light bordeaux(?) which was absolutely divine with the duck. it was one our waiter recommended so other waiters may know as it may be chef recommended.\n\ni will absolutely come back. in fact, i feel like checking out the one in nyc now!", 
            "unreal spaghetti. i know, it's spaghetti you say. easy enough. it's amazing. saw it on the techniques episode of no reservations, tried it, then had to punch myself for not trying it sooner in ny. everything else was great too. <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> and <mark>Crispy Fritto Misto</mark> to start, spaghetti and <mark>Black Cod</mark> to finish. highlight was the spaghetti though.", 
            "a lot of ups and downs for us on our stop here!\n\nas per <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark>, we requested a view of the bellagio fountains.  absolutely gorgeous!  however, there is a horizontal opaque support bar right at eye level if you're 6'0, so you have to duck or stand up a little bit to actually look out the window.\n\nservice was great as you would expect at any nice vegas restaurant.\n\nappetizers were delicious!  we had the scallops and the polenta per our waiter's recommendations.  among the best you can ever find among appetizers.\n\nour entrees were a different story.  i don't feel the spaghetti was that special.  a former reviewer referenced \"asian hand-pulled noodles\" and was dead on.  any quality housemade noodle will taste like this, and it is very basically seasoned.  not quite a great entree in itself, especially a meatless dish for a carnivore like myself.\n\nthe lady got <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark>, as she is a foie gras fiend.  however, even this dish came out a little salty with only a hint of foie gras detected.  the pasta was still good.\n\nmaybe our expectations were too high after the appetizers.\n\nwe also didn't get any wine, though i heard the wine list is fabulous.\n\nthe price is very reasonable too.  we'd probably come back.  well, there are a lot of places to try in vegas, so maybe not.", 
            "scarpetta has amazing food and is in a great location with nice views. \n\nthe <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> and polenta appetizers were both delicious with the <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> being slightly better.\n\nthe short rib agnolloti and the duck and <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark> were two amazing pastas that are very unique to the restaurant.\n\nthe entrees did not live up to the first two courses but the baby goat was satisfying. i wouldn't recommend the halibut.\n\nthe head chef scott conant was in the restaurant which is very rare for vegas. when you head to this restaurant stick mostly with the pastas and appetizers and you will have a unique and enjoyable dining experience.", 
            "as guest we felt like a burden instead of welcomed and we found the foods  we tried as one dimensional and under seasoned , flat and the dessert awful . maybe they just weren't in the working flow of things yet or maybe it just was an off night i don't know.\n\nthe door was wide open at 5:25 so we walked in and the hostess told us to make a reservation for 5:30 and to leave and come back in a few minutes . we thought that seemed odd but thought it was just because she was very young and figured that was all it was and came back a few minutes latter .\n\ntoo start with i received a white lint filled napkin on top of my black pants , but i did notice they have black linen napkins they use for the wine bottles. \n\nwe felt uncomfortable the whole time dining because most of the time i saw up to eleven members of staff were standing across from us with their backs against the wall just looking out into our direction . i glared at them a few times but they didn't budge .\n\nwe started with the <mark>Tuna susci</mark> -described as marinated vegetables with preserved truffles , everything was <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> everything had little taste.\n\nwe shared the <mark>Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti</mark> , that were like mini raviolis filled with short rib that had a baby food texture inside the well made pasta. maybe ten percent of the  agnolottis we topped with a scant amount of toasted  crumbs slightly laced with horseradish for flavor that were resting in some browned butter.\n\nthe <mark>Black Cod</mark> although cooked nicely would have been forgettable but was not , only because of the concentrated tomato that i found interesting .  this dish was extremely mild and under seasoned with a few pieces of fennel that were nicely caramelized .\n\nmy husband had the <mark>Spiced Duck Breast</mark> and he said it was his least favorite one he ever had since the skin wasn't crispy and also lacked flavor , he thought it wasn't seasoned at all .\n\nwe had a little time to kill before the show so we thought maybe dessert might be good . we ordered the zeppole i don't mean to be mean or disrespectful but honest to god they tasted just like the chocolate muffins of the sweet tomatoes salad bar buffet , the zeppole were bread like , not sweet , almost not chocolate flavored and only a few zeppole not all had essence of nutella in them . \n\nat this price range they don't have this much room for error.", 
            "great service, but the food was far below our expectations. \n\nthe bread basket was great, my personal favorite was the salami infused slices. as far as the meals go, my date ordered the the <mark>Creamy Polenta</mark> as her appetizer and she seemed to enjoy it. \n\ni opted for the <mark>Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti</mark> as my main dish and the pasta was loaded with <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> horseradish which flat out overpowered the whole dish with almost every bite. and i love spicy food, but it would took my breath away with almost every bite, so it was far too much for my liking. you would have to absolutely love horseradish to even enjoy this dish. \n\nmy date ordered the risotto with vegetables from the vegetarian menu which was just mixed diced vegetables. the dish came out at room temperature and did not taste good at all, so the order was sent back.\n\ni will not be returning to scarpetta, nor will i ever recommend it to anyone i know.", 
            "i wanted to love scarpetta, i really did. i was still mesmerized by the striking view i got to take in during the grand opening and determined to prove all of the reviews about the mediocre service wrong, but our waiter left me no choice but to report otherwise.\n\ni want to point out the highlights before i rip scarpetta to shreds. i came in for restaurant week so got the pre-fixe menu and chose the <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark>, <mark>Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti</mark>, and <mark>Coconut Panna Cotta</mark>. i thought the <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> had great flavor and was presented beautifully. my only complaint was that it seemed to be served a little on the warm side to me which is a concern when it comes to <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark>.\n\nthe <mark>Coconut Panna Cotta</mark>/guava soup was not only delicious but beautiful too. the almost tart soup was a nice contrast to the creamy <mark>Coconut Panna Cotta</mark>-probably the best <mark>Coconut Panna Cotta</mark> i've ever had! not too rich or too sweet, and again, perfectly balanced with the cold fruit soup. i usually don't go for dessert soups, but i'd probably come back just for that.\n\nthe view is killer-great front row seats to the bellagio water show!\n\nnow for the bad.\n\nstrike one: maybe this is just me being very nitpicky, but the presentation of the <mark>Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti</mark> was just gross. the pasta was served in a wide, shallow bowl and the appearance of pasta in one thin layer with hardly any garnish (save the breadcrumbs which had a nice flavor) was just unappetizing. also, the pasta was incredibly greasy. i've had pasta in brown butter sauce before that didn't look like that. the filling was good, very rich and flavorful, but the sauce was just off-putting. \n\nstrike two: for the duration of our dinner, a toddler continuously screamed at the top of his lungs, banged on the table, stood on the booth in which his family was sitting and annoyed the crap out of the surrounding diners. as a fine dining restaurant, it's your responsibility to make sure that the experience is just that, fine dining. which means if you need to tell this family who cannot control their spoiled infant to beat it, in the interest of preserving the experience for surrounding diners, then do it. after an hour of embarrassing behavior and ugly stares from other tables, the dad who was elegantly dressed in board shorts, shower shoes and a baseball cap removed the child from the fine dining situation. i feel like the management should've handled this earlier, but god forbid they offend one person who is offending the entire restaurant. \n\nstrike three: our waiter was a dud. i get it, everyone has their off days, but i think this waiter's life was a series of off days. i'm hoping that his service standards weren't lowered because we were getting what was essentially a discounted menu, but i can't help that think this was the case. discounted menu=less tip? not always. but if your behavior warrants a tip to match the discounted bill then that's what you'll get. it took about 15 minutes for bread to come out and for the waiter to bring water. then another 15 minutes for him to take our order for wine. and about another 20 minutes to take our food order. i shouldn't have to flag you down and tell you we're ready to order. that's not my job as a patron of the restaurant. i wasn't in any rush, but those lapses in time mean either this dude was just straight up inattentive or suffering the early stages of dementia. everything about the dinner just dragged on unnecessarily. he was inattentive and seemed disinterested in our table-there were only two of us and we're definitely not high maintenance so i'm not sure what the issue was.\n\nour waiter was in no way personable and just rubbed me the wrong way. maybe we caught him on a bad night. maybe he didn't feel like we deserved the attention that someone who was ordering off of the regular menu did. regardless, in these economically unbalanced times, when so many people are opting to eat cheaper or stay home and cook, i feel like the restaurant industry should feel the pressure to give diners the experience they pay for. even if we were getting your dishes for a reduced price-we are still dining in your restaurant and your standard of service should be equal across the board. you are a fine dining restaurant and i hold you to a higher standard than, say a denny's. but if you perform like a denny's waiter, i will tip you like a denny's waiter. \n\n\ni'm not sure i would come back because i was truly annoyed with the service. maybe i'd come back for the guava soup...and have it at the bar.", 
            "the food is 5 stars.  the service is 5 stars.  the wine list is 5 stars.  the price is 5 star-level pricing.  but who cares; it's the best italian food in vegas.\n\nbut the music is way too loud for fine dining.  do i want a hard rock band screaming at me at obscene decibels when i bite into 4 paper-thin pieces of the best <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> tail i've put into my mouth, ever?  no, not for $16.  that's 4 bucks a bite, and the hard core, fingernails on a chalkboard in a megaphone screaming is free.\n\nthe wine list is awesome.  splurge and you'll never regret it.\n\ntheir famous spaghetti is famous for a reason.  $26 for pasta and some sauce.  that's it?  yes.  and it's worth every penny.\n\nthe veal is stellar on every level, with the chanterelles, mini-me artichokes, fruit reduction, a hint of cumin, and sweet breads (my sweet breads were a little dry, though).  the veal itself is all the crispy outside, tender/moist inside, and intensity of flavors you're hoping for.\n\nthe coconut/guava ice cream desert was very, very good and light.  5 stars.\n\nthe cheese course was only okay.  three small pieces of cheese the size of my thumb underwhelmed me.  i would pass on this next time.  we were spoiled by providence's cheese course, though.\n\nawesome capuccino.", 
            "our server started us out with an array of different breads, accompanied by mascarpone butter, an eggplant tomato caponata & citrus olive oil. i often tend to judge a meal as soon as the bread (or chips... etc) arrives to the table. first impressions are crucial! if you ever dine at scarpetta, dig for the warm stromboli loaf in your bread basket first! it pairs really wonderfully with the caponata, but also stands strong on its own. you definitely want to eat this bread while its hot- because its stuffed with layers of salami & mozzarella. yum!\n\nmy first course was <mark>Braised Short Ribs of Beef</mark> over a farro risotto. the beef was immensely tender & alive with flavor. it had a very thin slice of parmesan resting on top of it, just barely melted. nice touch! i loved how hearty the risotto was- this is nothing my mom would have ever prepared for me...but somehow the risotto tasted home-y. i didn't even have time to identify all the vegetables that were in this dish, because i was far too busy stuffing my face. between bites of the short ribs, i had a few pieces of <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark>. incredibly fresh, with such great flavor. unknown to me at the time, it was adorn with almost microscopic red onions (gross)...but i ate each piece very willingly- despite my hatred for onions.\n\nfor my main course i had the <mark>Prime Aged Sirloin</mark> <mark>Braised Short Ribs of Beef</mark>. it was served with wild mushrooms, potato gnocchi & barolo ragu. everything on the plate was exceedingly juicy & robust, without being overwhelming. the gnocchi was a great equalizer to the sirloin and the ragu. this dish was really unforgettable, hats off to scott conant.\n\ndessert was very simple! <mark>Coconut Panna Cotta</mark> served with coconut sorbetto, pineapples & guava soup, ofcourse this is my pick- being a true hawaiian & all. i could have done without the crushed pineapples, i felt like they interfered with the guava coconut vibe i had going. i had mentally prepared myself for the guava soup to be too sweet, but fortunately, i was incorrect. in addition to that, i was thrilled with how smooth the <mark>Coconut Panna Cotta</mark> was. each bite was like silk!\n\nin short, i loved scarpetta. 4 stars!", 
            "restaurant week 2011. the wife and i only planned on going out only once for restaurant week, but after perusing all the menus we were persuaded to try one more place -- scarpetta at the cosmopolitan. we were seated at a two-top by the window overlooking the bellagio fountains. one of the better views in town, it makes for a great spot for a romantic night out. the clean lines and modern motif of the restaurant interior add to the upscale and elegant atmosphere.\n\nscarpetta might have one of the best bread baskets around, but that can solely be attributed to the stromboli found within. warm, chewy and delicious, it's almost a meal itself. the focaccia isn't bad either.\n\nthe first two dishes were <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> and polenta. the <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> consisted of four slices of fish topped with olio di zenzero, pickled red onions and microgreens. a couple slices were bland and under seasoned, while others were perfect. the other app ordered came on the recommendation of our waiter. and, i'm glad i listened to him. the <mark>Creamy Polenta</mark> came in a decent sized bowl along with a pot with truffled mushrooms fricassee, which the server promptly spooned into the polenta. the rich and savory dish was unlike any polenta i've had before. \n\nthe <mark>Prime Aged Sirloin</mark> beef entree came sliced, cooked medium rare as ordered and was accompanied by a few light and fluffy potato gnocchi, wild mushrooms, barolo ragu, and topped with paper thin slices of parmigiano. the sirloin was good, but not nearly as good as the other entree.\n\nthe <mark>Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti</mark> didn't look like much when it was placed on the table -- a shallow bowl filled with a modest amount of small stuffed pasta. but, the flavor from each bite was amazing. each piece was a thin, delicate piece of pasta stuffed with tender short rib, with an intensely rich sauce. i loved the added texture that the bread crumbs added. it was a great dish on every level.\n\ndesserts were tasty, as well. amadei <mark>Chocolate Cake</mark> with toasted almond gelato and salted caramel sauce was dense and moist. the <mark>Coconut Panna Cotta</mark> with coconut sorbetto, guava soup and pineapple was surprisingly light, creamy, and not too filling. it was a beautiful presentation with the guava soup covering and contrasting the <mark>Coconut Panna Cotta</mark> below.\n\nour service was a perfect compliment to our meal. luis timed everything perfectly and provided the kind of personalized, friendly service that every top-notch restaurant should have.\n\ni've had plenty of underwhelming experiences over the years for restaurant week, but this was definitely one of the best. i'm already thinking about when i'll be able to come back and hopefully enjoy more great food and service.", 
            "my 300th review and what an enjoyable experience.  this review honors the restaurant as well as my fellow <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> who always seem to make the right call.  \n\nthe strongest recommendations were the following and the <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> were right on:\nduck & <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark> - pretty amazing\nblack farfalle - bowtie pasta with lobster was delicous - the texture of this pasta felt like someone may have actually tied it in a bow\n\nthe spaghetti was good but serves more as a filler and does not stand out next to the other dishes.\n\ni had the sea bass (branzino) for my main dish which was also good but again, on this night, it was all about the pasta.", 
            "for years, i've always felt that -- among the casinos -- the mgm grand has the best restaurants.  this may be changing, and scarpetta is *certainly* one of the biggest reasons why.  \n\nlynn and i followed up our \"good\" dinner wednesday night at comme \\u00c7a (also <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark>) with dinner at scarpetta the next night (followed friday night by los, but that's been written up way to many times).  \n\nbeing a celebrity chef is a double-edged sword . . . it certainly gets your name out there, but then you (typically) aren't there to defend it -- someone else is in the kitchen is, but if it sucks, you get the blame.  a potentially dicey proposition at best.\n\nscott conant need not worry; his vegas outpost is in excellent hands.\n\nthe six of us began with a bottle of n.v. champagne from chartogne-taillet (cuv\\u00e9e ste.-anne), and ordered a round of appetizers \"for the table.\"  (the table, too, apparently was hungry -- not just the six of us!)  \n\nfinishing the champagne just as the appetizers arrived, we moved into a 2008 bruno giacosa arneis.  we enjoyed the <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> crudo, the <mark>Creamy Polenta</mark> with a fricassee of truffled mushrooms (the winner of this round, imho), and the roasted sea scallops with porcini and sunchokes . . . all were delightful!\n\nvegetarian alert:  this place is *very* cool, and vegetarian-friendly.  they have a totally separate vegetarian and vegan menu available for the asking (as one in our party did).\n\nmoving into the pasta course, we had the spaghetti with tomato and basil (so simple to say, so profound to eat -- nothing can describe the layers of flavor that you get here; magnificent!), the duck & <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark> with marsala reduction (ok, this is to die for!), and the <mark>Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti</mark> with with brown butter horseradish.  of course, we also moved into a stunning piedmontese red, the 1999 barbaesco riserva vigneti in ovello from the  produttori del barbaresco.  just gorgeous!\n\nour entr\\u00e9es included <mark>Black Cod</mark> with caramelized fennel & concentrated tomato, sirloin with potato gnocchi, wild mushrooms, parmigiano & barolo ragu, a veal chop the size of baltimore (and much more tasty), and the aforementioned spaghetti with tomato and basil (as an entr\\u00e9e portion).  \n\na little dessert, a little porto and coffee, and the world is a perfect place!\n\np.s. in case you haven't figured it out yet, their wine list is not only incredible, but there are some true gems on this list that remain real bargains (if you know how/where to look).", 
            "the diners: 9 ladies celebrating a bachelorette weekend. \nreservation time: 7:30p sat night.  we were late about 15 min. but we called ahead to let them know and they were cool about it. \nsome things we ordered:\n-calamari: thinly cut and deliciously flaky and salty.\n-<mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> appetizer: nicely flavored but oh-so not enough!  5 thin pieces\n-scallops: meh but then again i'm not a fan of scallops\n-duck & <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark>:  extremely rich, definitely get as appetizer and not an entree\n-black farfalle: the presentation didn't look that appealing cuz it is literally a dish of black pasta, but taste-wise it was pretty good; small but sufficient amounts of maine lobster\n-halibut: on the drier side\n-stracchi: interestingly small squares of flat pasta\n-desserts: napoleon was popular with the group, zeppole was so-so, <mark>Chocolate Cake</mark> was really rich but imo yummiest of all the desserts, and lastly....the cheesecake....blech!\n\ndescription of the cheesecake dessert on the menu...\"cheesecake.  mango granita, pistachio brittle\".  when you order cheesecake, you expect to get a sweet creamy cake made from cream cheese, right?  not here!  it's goat cheese people!  so if you like goat cheese cheesecake you'll love the cheesecake at scarpetta.  most of the food was actually pretty good (4 stars worth) but because the stupid bald older waiter of ours failed to tell 2 of us who ordered the cheesecake that it is made from goat cheese, and then proceeded to argue w/ me saying that \"goat cheese\" was written on the menu...uh no it was not, can you read english?!...that took it down a notch for me.  not sure i'd go back myself.  if i do, i'll make sure not to have that guy wait on me again.", 
            "3.5 stars.\n\ni had:\npolenta with mushrooms\nspaghetti with basil\nbraised lentils\ngingerbread pear crisp and choc cake\n\npolenta with mushrooms --- must get . 5 stars. truly outstanding.\n\nspaghetti with basil --- lots of hype. yes, it is good. $24 good? not sure. pasta is fresh and flavorful, but this is still not a wow dish for me as other <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> seem to classify this.\n\nbraised lentils --- boring dish, nothing special or unique here, made me annoyed with myself that i ordered this given my gut told me it wouldn't be that great. \n\ngingerbread pear crisp and choc cake --- both good, but nothing special, creative, or unique here. standard dessert fare for a nicer restaurant.\n\ndid not live up to the hype. look it's good. but $75 a person for 3 courses good? nope.", 
            "one of the best meals of my life.\n\ni will preface the review by saying that we got the supreme hook up.  i am an acquaintance of chef dan rossi and he saw to it that we experienced scarpetta to the fullest.  a huge thank you again to chef dan and his hospitality and talented team.\n\nthe atmosphere: sleek, elegant, and sexy are the first words that come to mind.  the sound track puts you in the right mood but doesn't overwhelm.  one of the few hot spots in vegas where you don't have to shout to your dinner companions- i greatly appreciated this.  it is warm and inviting with these great s shaped booths.  yes, the waiters appear over your sholder when you're dining at the booths, but i didnt really mind that.\n\nthe food: i do not exagerate, one of the best meals of my life!\na break down-\npolenta with mushrooms- i could have drank that sauce and been satisfied, my bf who doesnt even like polenta went back for seconds and thirds!\nheirloom tomato salad- simple, clean, delicious\n<mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> carpaccio- i dont know how they get fish this fresh in vegas! light citrusy sauce with some crunch from the salt on top. perfection.\nshort ribs- i dont usually eat meat but when i saw that these babies basically fall off the bone as soon as a fork comes near, i had to try.\n\ntaglietelle with veggies and truffle cream- this is not a light dish! the homemade pasta is cooked to a perfect al dente and the sauce is everything that something with truffles should be.  my bf's fave of the night.\nshort rib ravioli- a special that night.  again, i'm vegetarian and this was my fave dish.  it its offered when you go, dont miss it.\n\nbranzino with leeks and asparagus- light and refreshing after the heavier pastas.  crispy skin on the fish. leeks roasted till they carmelized.  i could eat this every night and be a happy girl.\n\ngingerbread and pear tarte with cinnamon gelato- order it!!!!\n\ni'm not usually this long winded in reviews but i was just so happy with the entire evening.  in addition wines by the glass are generously poured and therefore worth the steep-ish price.  i'd recommend this as a place for couples, non-rowdy bday parties, and those looking for an elegant evening without a bass infused club sound track.\n\nthank you, thank you chef rossi.", 
            "we went here for one of our dinners in vegas this weekend. we were able to get a good reservation on a short notice, and were seated near the window overlooking the bellagio fountain so that was a nice touch.\n\nserver was extremely knowlegable and even shared some additional knowledge he had about the sommelier. turns out he is one of four master sommelier's in las vegas, and has his own vineyard. nice guy to chat with.\n\nnow the food... we started with the <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark>, moved on to the black farfalle, and ended with the <mark>Prime Aged Sirloin</mark>. <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> was awesome, though could have been sliced a little thicker. if you have never had black farfalle, i suggest getting it here. the server mentioned it would have a shelfish taste, but i didn't find it to be overwhelming, instead a nice balance. the <mark>Prime Aged Sirloin</mark> came with perfectly prepared gnocchi, which is a hard task seemingly for many chefs to pull off. but they did tonight! the barolo ragu was a perfect addition to bring the dish altogether.\n\nthe only thing i would say is the wine list was a tad overpriced in comparison to what i would expect from retail / dining out. so that is what made the 4th star come out. \n\ndefinitely a great dining experience.", 
            "i was visiting vegas with a group of girls and wanted to eat at one of vegas's top restaurants.  searching through <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark>, scarpetta seemed like a good choice.  i knew it was more expensive but from the reviews i was assuming it was worth it.  i definitely do not think it was.\n\nthe food was good, but not worth the price tag.  the pastas were the best part so if you do make it to scarpetta i would suggest sticking to one of the pastas.  the total bill for the 6 of us was around $500.  we ordered a few drinks and a couple bottles of wine and though i don't have anything about the food to complain about i just don't think it was worth $500.  normally when i have a meal with that price point i am expecting some experimentation with foods or unique pairings.  scarpetta did not try anything new.  steaks, typical pastas, decent portions, but nothing new.  \n\nthere are so many choices for restaurants in vegas so i just can't recommend this one.", 
            "i was slightly disappointed with the food here.  from all the reviews i read, i thought that the pasta here was going to be exceptional. first off, let me state that the waiter i had was absolutely great and the view of the bellagio and the fountains was fantastic as well.\n\nsince none of the appetizers sounded appealing to me, i decided to order two pasta dishes.  i first ordered the spaghetti.  on the menu, it simply states \"spaghettti-tomato and basil.\"  as i started eating it, i realized that it was actually spicy and felt my lips burning.  given that this is their signature dish, i expected to be blown away and i was not.  i feel that if the food is going to be spicy, they should let you know-this spaghetti certainly had more to it than simply tomato and basil.\n\nthe next dish i had was the stracci-which was their seafood pasta dish that on the night i was there included crab, shrimp, and lobster.  the seafood was laid out on top of thin ribbons of black and <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> pasta.  while the seafood was tasty, i thought the dish was somewhat unimaginative.\n\nbetween these two pasta dishes and the bread that came out, which was fantastic, i was full and had to skip dessert.\n\nwould i go back to scarpetta?  probably not, especially when considering there are so many fine restaurants in las vegas and the fact that with tax and tip, i spent close to $90 just for one person.  at the end of the day, i thought that the food was good but i just expected a bit more.", 
            "first, i met mike tyson when i dined here! and we danced in the middle of the restaurant. so an extra star for that!\n\nscarpetta is a beautiful restaurant. beautiful earth tones and a intoxicating view of the bellagio fountains.\n\nscarpetta is one of those fancy restaurants with menu items that no one really knows how to pronounce; needless to say, i just ordered and hoped for the best. and the results we're favorable!\n\ni could mention what i ate/ordered, but this place doesn't offer a fixed menu. it's seasonal and changes because your quality freshness. everything that was order was amazing. there's a bread basket... i could have kept eating that and been a happy camper. there were several variations, my favorite was the stramboli (not the american version - i asked the server what it was because it was slap yo' mama good!), it's a combination of fresh bread and meat. it was a joygasm to the mouth! the bread basket is served with a fancy whipped butter, a roasted eggplant dip, and olive oil. \n\ni order the <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> tail app (which they always have) and it did not disappoint. fresh and tasty! i ordered a pasta dish (no idea what, who, where, why, yaddda, yadda, insert fancy words and culture here) and it was flavorful and light. the portion size was perfect. not too much or too little. seriously, i don't think you take doggy bags from places like that.\n\nwe ordered several desserts and they were all great and small enough to not get stuff and big enough to share.\n \nthey have an extensive wine list and it covers an entire length of a wall. it's a pretty sight.\n\nthe service was impeccable. spot on. courteous. attentive.\n\noverall, scarpetta was de to the lish. if i could afford it, i would definitely go back in a minute! i yearn for you stramboli. definitely not your traditional italian, but a great modern twist.", 
            "the final meal of our vegas escapade was well spent at scarpetta. it wasn't completely perfect but most of the night made up for the little missteps (we'll get to that later) so for the most part, i had nothing but a good time. attentive service, rich indulgent food, all housed within an intimate space with gorgeous views of the ballagio fountains, we closed our trip in pure hedonistic style.\n\nwe started with some of their signature cocktails as we browsed the menu. upon the recommendation from our fantastic server, and the joys of libation, we decided on the tasting menu ($99) and accompanying wine pairing ($49) since several of the dishes that we wanted to try were on it anyway and boy did we pick right. that was the beginning of six courses of pure pleasure.\n\nwe started with a sashimi plate (http://www.<mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark>.com/biz_photos/0nmtwqyeqikerdv4a55obg?select=yvhgcff5cqsiopyc83uwwa) which consisted of <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> with a drizzle of ginger oil and red onions. the other half of the plate sat the <mark>Tuna susci</mark> - tuna wrapped marinated vegetables. the fish was so fresh and the flavors were delicately balanced. the bread basket came shortly after and there was a nice selection including yummy foccacia and stromboli. as part of the tasting menu, the chef also threw in a couple of surprises and we were treated to a delightful seafood <mark>Crispy Fritto Misto</mark> for this course. perfectly crispy fried but not oily, every bite was yummy and the rock shrimp just melted in my mouth.  \n\nthe next course was a perfectly roasted sea scallop. (http://www.<mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark>.com/biz_photos/0nmtwqyeqikerdv4a55obg?select=06qyvnxbie8hftnykn4obw) it was a joy to eat and the velvety salmoriglio sauce was a nice accompaniment to the sweet and juicy scallop. the chef's extra this course was a polenta with a truffle mushroom stew. (http://www.<mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark>.com/biz_photos/0nmtwqyeqikerdv4a55obg?select=gtrwgpr4xgghmw0rvryanw) for the record i hate cornmeal and thus hate grits, tamales, and polenta. yet, i could not stop eating this polenta. the flavors of the mushroom stew combine with the impeccably smooth polenta. (i suspect there's a whole lot more butter in it than what chef scott conant lets on) it was a nice double headliner with the scallop. \n\nnext up was the pasta course and chef conant's signature tomato & basil spaghetti. (http://www.<mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark>.com/biz_photos/0nmtwqyeqikerdv4a55obg?select=jqrljq4g8bgizxs0bc8bow) fresh made pasta in a simple tomato basil (+ quarter stick of butter) sauce but just perfectly executed. while i thoroughly enjoyed it, the chef's extra this course, the <mark>Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti</mark> with brown butter horseradish & toasted breadcrumb (http://www.<mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark>.com/biz_photos/0nmtwqyeqikerdv4a55obg?select=wzfcolektvylois628h_ag), totally blew my mind. wow who would have thought that the combination of short ribs, horseradish, and toasted breadcrumbs could be so sublime? i miss it already as i speak. \n\nthe next course was the <mark>Black Cod</mark>. (http://www.<mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark>.com/biz_photos/0nmtwqyeqikerdv4a55obg?select=2tmoceavt5t4aeu8j6itra) again perfectly seared but wonderfully moist in the middle. the fatty fish absolutely stands out against the sauce and caramelized fennel. delicious. the next entree course was a the <mark>Spiced Duck Breast</mark>. (http://www.<mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark>.com/biz_photos/0nmtwqyeqikerdv4a55obg?select=br1frh72uravjtrhiq6w-a) while this was my least favorite dish of the night, it was still absolutely delicious which tells you the quality of the food all night. the orange and spices (i kept picking up 5 spice) worked well with gamy duck. all in all, a successful combination. \n\nfinal course and dessert was a <mark>Chocolate Cake</mark> with toasted almond gelato and caramel. (http://www.<mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark>.com/biz_photos/0nmtwqyeqikerdv4a55obg?select=udi5apzqgqwuqcgjvukosg) this is where i really had to throw in the towel after all that eating. the <mark>Chocolate Cake</mark> was really rich and decadent and i could only finish half of it but i just couldn't let the toasted almond gelato go to waste. it was just delicious. you can totally taste the toasted flavor. \n\nnow on to the kink of the night. since we were seated by the wine cellar, the sommelier came by several times to retrieve bottles of wine. each single time, he let the door hit me as i was eating without even acknowledging it, much less apologize. not that it was a deal breaker but you expect a little more basic courtesy especially when you're dropping good money on dinner. \n\nstill for a wonderfully decadent meal paired with friendly and attentive service, we had a good time and i strongly recommend scarpetta if you want to treat yourself to a fine meal on the strip.", 
            "the bread basket alone would bring me back! that stromboli is amazing! i love salami and bread, so put the two together.....fuggetaboutit!\n\nwe had the tasting menu: \n\n- duo of <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> and tuna \"susci\": melt in your mouth delicious!\n\n- roasted sea scallops, cauliflower, bottarga, chili and caper salmoriglio: sea scallops can be rubbery and chewy if not cooked properly, but at scarpetta, they were cooked to perfection. they had the consistency of flaky, firm fish and the roasted cauliflower was a perfect pairing.\n\n- spagetti tomato basil - simple and good, but not memorable.\n\n- <mark>Black Cod</mark>, caramelized fennel & concentrated tomatoes - the fish was nice and flakey and the tomatoes added a nice acidity to the fish. i'm not a fan of fennel as they are too \"licorice-y\" in flavor for my taste.\n\n- <mark>Spiced Duck Breast</mark>, endive, preserved orange and cippollini - delicious! i love duck, but i hate when its not cooked properly or tastes overly fatty. this was a perfect balance. the preserved orange cut through the richness of the duck. yum!\n\n- amedei <mark>Chocolate Cake</mark> & toasted almond gelato - toasted almond gelato & salted caramel sauce. self explanatory....it was heaven!\n\nwhat made this experience special was that the chef brought out a few mini appetizers with every dish served, so it was like having an \"extended\" tasting menu. he brought out:\n\n- <mark>Crispy Fritto Misto</mark> - seafood, vegetables, artichokes, herbs & lemon\n- <mark>Creamy Polenta</mark> - fricassee of truffled mushrooms: by far my favorite dish at scarpetta. upon first glance, it looks like it would be too heavy and rich, but it was amazing!\n- <mark>Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti</mark> - brown butter horseradish & toasted breadcrumb.\n- zeppole - nutella center, vanilla sauce and candied hazelnuts. need i say more?\n\ni loved the ambiance and service of this restaurant. we were seated by the window facing the fountains of bellagio. a beautiful place to take someone on a date!", 
            "excellent restaurant.  rounding my 4.5 stars up to 5.\n\nsexy ambiance.  lovely, low lighting and a fabulous view of the bellagio fountains and the strip.  \n\nabsolutely beautiful service.  our server and every runner and busser were friendly and classy.  attentive but completely unobtrusive.  perfect.\n\nthe delicious meal started with their bread basket.  all of the breads and accompaniments (mascarpone butter, citrus olive oil and caponata) were great, especially the stromboli.  that was certainly a nice surprise!\n\nwe started with the <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> which was well-seasoned.  i loved the little crystals of flavored salt.    my guy had the stracci, a wide, flat pasta served with seafood.  very delicious and simple.  i had the foie and <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark> which was pretty amazing.  both dishes were very light on sauce, which i enjoyed.\n\nthe desserts were very good as well.  man-friend had the <mark>Chocolate Cake</mark> with almond gelato.  very tasty.  my mocha cheesecake was absolutely delicious.\n\ngreat restaurant for a sexy date.", 
            "while looking for a place to have dinner, i only needed to read 5 words to convince me to try this place out.  those five magical words were \"duck and fois <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark>.\"  umm...yes please!  so with little hesitation we called in for a reservation and i excitedly awaited dinner time.\n\nonce we arrived at scarpetta, we noticed that the decor was nice but not stuffy.  the people in the dining area seemed to be enjoying themselves and the view overlooking the bellagio fountain just added to the overall ambiance of the restaurant.  the ambiance and decor definitely work well to add to the dining experience at this restaurant.\n\nthe service was also another thing that was nice and attentive but not overly intrusive.  they were very quick to take our drink orders and were quick to come back once they noticed we were ready to order.  they also did a great job of explaining all the complimentary breads and butters as well as fielding any other question we had.  \n\nnow for the important part, the food.  here's a quick break down of what we had:\n\ncomplimentary bread:\n\nordinarily i wouldn't even mention this.  i mean, there are some restaurants that give you some phenomenally good bread but here is the thing that puts scarpetta above and beyond those other places.  the stromboli!  holy moly this thing is good.  bread baked around cheese and pepperoni (i think it was pepperoni) was just so good.  i honestly could have had this for dinner and i would've have been completely happy.\n\nappetizers:\n\n<mark>Tuna susci</mark> -   assorted marinated veggies and preserved truffles wrapped in tuna.  i suppose this was the chef's interpretation of a sushi roll but i have to say that it just fell flat.  i mean with truffle and tuna in the mix i am still scratching my head as to how this couldn't be good, but it just wasn't.  it was bland and under-seasoned.  my recommendation, don't get it.\n\nbeet salad - pretty much what you expect of a beet salad.  a great assortment of different beets with pumpkin seeds and stracciatella cheese with a balsamic dressing, it was refreshing and delicious.\n\n<mark>Braised Short Ribs of Beef</mark> - this was by far my favorite appetizer.  the short rib was succulent and delicious.  bedded on root veggies and risotto, this in a larger portion would make an amazing entree, let alone an outstanding appetizer.\n\nentree:\n\nindulge me for just a second while i d<mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> perverted metaphor.  if dinner were a porno, the bread was the nasty making out, the appetizers the foreplay, then the duck and fois <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark> would be the money shot.  goodness sakes alive this is one delicious pasta.  a nice big plate of perfectly cooked ravioli with a drizzle of marsala reduction; these decadent little bites were heaven in tiny little pockets of pasta.  if you like duck and fois gras, this is a must!\n\noverall, i had a great meal here.  i thought the prices were reasonable for vegas fine dining, the ambiance great, the service spot on, and the food was just phenomenal.  honestly, if i hadn't gotten the <mark>Tuna susci</mark> appetizer, this would have been just about the perfect meal, but even the susci couldn't dissuade me from giving scarpetta a well deserved 5 stars.  bravo!", 
            "good: everything!\nbad: nothing!\n\nswear this is the best food i have eaten in a very long time! \n\nthe dinner breads were great and had a good variety. the pepperoni stromboli bread could've been a meal alone.\n\nfor appetizers we had the braised short ribs, <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark>, and beet salad. the short ribs were tender, flavorful, cooked perfectly, and had a good portion size. the <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> was fresh and so tasty with the pickeled red onion, loved it! as for the beet salad, the best i have ever eaten. (period).\n\nentrees included the signature spaghetti (i will perfect this at home!), duck & <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark>, and the 24 oz ribey. the spaghetti was perfect, amazing, simple, delicious, and awesome. our ribeye was cooked and seasoned so well, i was glad to get the last piece! the duck and <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark>...heaven in your mouth with blessings from on high...i have never been so pleased and i spent the longest time enjoying this dish.\n\nfor dessert, we had the crispy sweet risotto crepes. these were surprisingly good and the sorbet was awesome! perfect way to end the meal.\n\ni have been thinking about the <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark> daily for the past 4 weeks, you have to try them.", 
            "i'd have to agree with the other reviews on how amazing this place was. service was top notch. food was fantastic. drinks were delish! definitely exceeded my expectations of food, service, and beautiful view of the strip and bellagio fountains. \n\ndrinks: the bartender knows how to make his drinks. my sister got the berry smash which was made with fresh fruit. very yummy! not too sweet and just the right amount of fruity. i got an old fashion. i've been searching las vegas for the best old fashion and this place wasn't too bad. only thing lacking was a cherry\n\nfood: \n1) braised short ribs with root veggie and risotto- the risotto was a perfect pairing for this dish. it was super delish! if the meat was tender enough to cut with a fork i would say perfect. don't get me wrong it was still tender, but i think this dish would be perfect if it were just a tad more tender\n2) sushi slices- pass on the <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark>. save room for the other stuff (good and fresh but there is so much other stuff to try)\n\n3) roasted scallop- i'd have to say this was my fave of the night. i have a thing about scallops. they always seem to disappoint. but sw at the wynn and scarpetta have won me over with these amazing scallops. yummmmmm\n\n4) polenta with truffle mushroom- i love mushrooms and this went perfect with the polenta. it came in two separate pots that you would mix together. super fab. it seems like an odd side dish for the food but get it anyway!\n\npastas:\n5) spaghetti with tomato and basil- i wasn't impressed by this basic spaghetti that a lot of <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> raved about. but the noodles were really good. home made noodles a little bit chewy and more dense than the standard spaghetti noodle you make at home\n6) duck and <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark>- i'm not a big fan of foie gras but everyone at the table loved this dish. they said it was the best pasta dish we got.\n7) stracci- lobster, crab, shrimp, and basil- this was my fav pasta dish. it was bursting with flavor. the shellfish was perfectly delicious. must try\n\n8) lamb- my goodness this was the best lamb i ever had. if i didn't know any better i wouldn't even have known i was eating lamb. there was almost zero gamey taste that is commonly associated with lamb. yummmmmm\n\ndessert:\nwe had about 4 desserts. but the best i think was the gingerbread pear crisp. get a little side of gelato/ice cream. it was so good. i was stuffed to the brim at this point but i had to have more!\n\nwe also had some fish but i would go with the other amazing food rather than the fish dish. would love to come back here. its quite expensive but also quite yummy. my tummy was more than satisfied when i left :)", 
            "owner scott conant (the dude from chopped) hates <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark>. therefore, i don't trust him... half kidding\n\ni think scarpetta is more like 4 stars, but i knocked off a star because our party definitely felt a little sick after eating here. maybe it was an off day (we think it's from the cheese in the potatoes of a side dish).\n\nundeniably a beautiful spot to eat. the large windows display the neighboring bellagio water fountain show, where my girlfriends and i packed into one side of the booth, so we could watch and eat at the same time.\n\noysters west coast - good, fresh <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark>. i loved the horseradish sauce that came with it, and a gravy boat of tabasco was brought to us upon request\n\nstracci - a flat noodle pasta with lobster, crab, shrimp. there were generous portions of seafood and the pasta and tasted creamy/good.\n\nduck & <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark> - i actually have to go against the hype to say that it was just okay, and not that great. the dish was a tad bit colder than luke warm, and just the richness of the foie gras/drier duck made it hard to finish the whole dish. maybe a couple bites and i was pretty much done with it :-p\n\n<mark>Black Cod</mark> - so soft and melted in my mouth (i think i ate a cloud..). \n\nribeye <mark>Braised Short Ribs of Beef</mark> 24 oz - for $62, this had better been some good ribeye. although i know that scarpetta doesn't specialize in steak, i thought it was a bit overpriced for it being standard and nothing special.  even though it was medium-rare, the steak was still a tad tough.\n\n**don't fill up on the bread** scarpetta has fantastic bread. the bread basket had 3-4 different kinds of breads, one of them being a melted roll of salami and cheese (a meal itself). and the bread came with mascarpone butter (love), eggplant dip, and olive oil\n\none of the better restaurants in the cosmo. did anybody realize the restaurants in the city center area (cosmopolitan, vdara, aria) are not that great? hmmm", 
            "yum, yum, yum! i really enjoyed this restaurant. the decor was very sleek and we were seated next to a window with a gorgeous view of the bellagio fountains. we started off with the orgasmic <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> as an appetizer. as an entree i had stracci which was pasta with lobster, crab, shrimp and basil breadcrumbs. it was very light yet flavorful. the ambiance was quiet and intimate, perfect for a romantic dinner and conversation. the service was not memorable not extremely attentive. it was just okay, but the view, ambiance, and food outweigh the lack of service.", 
            "the boyfriend has been pining for this restaurant after hearing about their amazing spaghetti. also, after finding out that the man behind the restaurant is a judge from the food network's chopped, i was sold.\n\nthe food did not disappoint. we had the <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> tail as an appetizer, then the famed spaghetti and the sirloin. we decided we were going to share everything and the kitchen was actually nice enough to split each dish so that it was presented on two separate plates to us. each plate looked exactly as it would if it were the full portion. to top that off, they didn't even charge a splitting fee like so many restaurants usually would! that is what i call spectacular service. \n\ni'm a sucker for bread and their bread basket had me half full before we even ordered! the bread filled with salami and cheese was the favorite. it came with 3 dipping sauces, a marscapone cheese, tomato with eggplant, and a citrus oil. i thought the best combination was the citrus oil with the tomato and eggplant. \n\nthe <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> tail was fresh and had a nice chili kick to it. there were small chunks of rock salt that added a little crunch. it came with 4 slices of <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> tail, which was actually more than we expected.\n\nthe spaghetti lives up to its reputation. it was beautifully presented, swirled up into a pile and they uncover the plate right in front of you. the sauce is perfectly seasoned and the tomatoes still have a slight acidity. the pasta itself is cooked al dente and they're beautifully thick spaghetti noodles. i had to eat this one noodle at a time so i could make it last as long as possible. \n\nthe sirloin was cooked to our liking, but it was a bit chewy. we both loved the vegetables that came underneath it. there were carrots, mushrooms, potatoes, and probably some others and they were all so good!\n\nat the last minute, we decided to get the amedei <mark>Chocolate Cake</mark> with the almond gelato and salted caramel sauce. the gelato was my favorite part of the plate, although it looked partly melted by the time it got to the table. the <mark>Chocolate Cake</mark> was like a lava cake, where the middle is still fudge like. it could have been warmer. i thought the plate could use more of the gelato and almond gelato to balance out how rich the chocolate is. also, the bf ordered a coffee and it came with refills! \n\none complaint is that we were seated along the wine fridge and someone would come by every once in a while and just open it up behind us. having the chilled refrigerator air interrupt a nice meal isn't the most fun. but if you are seated by the window, there is an amazing view of the bellagio fountains.\n\nfor the price, it was actually a good amount of food and it is quality food. i really cannot wait for the spaghetti again. when i eat my jarred preggo tomato sauce, i'll be fantasizing about the spaghetti here.", 
            "came here for a girl's weekend out. what a great experience! \nscarpetta is located on the third floor of the cosmopolitan hotel. it's quite swanky, so you will want to dress up so you don't stick out like a sore thumb. the ambience is classy /sophisticated. the lighting is a bit dark, but that's why this is a great set up for looking out the window at night to see the bellagio water show. it's a great place to take a date or to just have a \"let's get dressed up cuz we can\" night out with the girls.\nwe had a reservation, so we were seated immediately. may i just mention that the service here is magnificent. there was just the three of us, but they still sat us in a huge booth that can easily sit 6 people. it's a circular booth, so i was a little apprehensive about scooting with my little black dress on. without saying a word, our host slid the whole table out, so that we can walk to our seats instead of scooting. from then, they had already won me over =).\n ok, let's get to the food shall we? we started with the \"<mark>Braised Short Ribs of Beef</mark>\" which is placed over root vegetables and risotto. delish. the short rib was soft and delicate and melt in your mouth deliciousness. not over seasoned at all. there are four small pieces, but each bite is delightful. the other appetizer that we decided to share was the \"roasted sea scallops\" which is served over cauliflower, bottarge, cili and caper sauce. aaaaaaaaaa-mazing. if i wasn't so nice, i would've eaten both pieces instead of share it. ;-)\nthe complimentary bread came with three spreads - butter, eggplant, and olive oil. all three tasted great and the different types of bread were warm and soft and all kinds of good =p. and since i love bread... this just won me over even more.\nso since this is an italian restaurant and the chef became famous because of his spaghetti, we all decided to order pasta. we ordered \"duck and <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark>\", \"spaghetti,\" and \"stracci\"... all of which were heavenly. the ravioli was soft, but not mushy and filled with such great flavor that my friend, who was already really full midway, ate the whole entire dish. spaghetti - you think it's just regular good ol' spaghetti... not at all. the pasta was cooked perfectly and the seasoning was on point. not too salty, not too sweet. perfect. my dish was the stracci - flat pieces of hand made noodles with lobster, crab, shrimp, and basil breadcrumbs. if you're mouth has not watered just reading that - something is seriously wrong with you. this is probably my most favorite pasta dish. they did not skimp on the blue crabs (i at least believe it's blue crabs, though, i can't be entirely sure), the lobster mean, and the shrimp. i wanted to save room for dessert, but i just couldn't stop stuffing myself with this dish. i loved that the flat noodles didn't stick to each other and it was soft and just really well made. i loved loved loved it!\ni wish i could tell you we ordered dessert. but the three of us were just so full that we decided to opt out of the dessert. though all of them sounded amazing.\nin any case, i rarely give out 5's. for me, something has to stick out. in this case, though the food was extraordinary, the service and the view puts it over my usual 4 stars into  a 5 star <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> review.\nbottom line: i would definitely come here again.. so there's not reason why you shouldn't try it out =)", 
            "i was very very excited to come here while on a girls weekend to vegas. both my friend and i thought this would be one of our highlights!\n\nunfortunately, it didn't live up to the hype in our visit. my friend has a few food allergies. their gluten-free menu was a great help, but we had asked for her to be contacted by the restaurant beforehand to verify that she would be able to eat there. she didn't need anything crazy, just a confirmation that very simple things could be accommodated. things that have been easily done by red robin and other chains. easy stuff. they called her an hour before our reservation and spoke for about 30 minutes.she was assured that the waiter would be notified of her needs and that her requests could easily be honored. great!\n\nwe get there and are seated right away (despite being a little late due to traffic) but our waiter knew nothing about the conversation that had taken place just 30 minutes before. he went to talk to the hostess and everyone played dumb all around. despite her requests being quite simple and her efforts to be an easy customer, we were made to feel like a great big hassle to everyone. \n\nwe split the <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> app and they messed up hers but quickly fixed it. it was so delicious though incredibly tiny even if we hadn't split the portion! there was a long delay for our entrees and the chef sent out a free salad during the wait. they also messed that up but fixed it. my friend had the <mark>Black Cod</mark> and i had the short rib angolotti. the cod was again a very small portion. the angolotti was a generous portion, especially given the richness. it was very good but we felt it overpriced for portion and quality, even for vegas.\n\ni had asked for my remaining angolotti (about 2/3 of my serving, so a large amount) to be boxed up to take with me and not 5 seconds after the waiter had acknowledged my request, he stacked a bunch of plates on top of my plate and walked off, thus ruining my leftovers. i watched him to make sure he wouldn't unstack the plates and scrape off my food into a box. luckily he did not. my annoyance was high and we had a show to attend so i decided to not make a fuss and just let it go.\n\nmy friend and i have eaten out many times at many different types of places with a variety of price points. this was the worst in terms of service at this type of restaurant. the food was ok. maybe it was an off night, who knows. i wouldn't waste my time or money here again when we come back to vegas.", 
            "prime location, delicious food, and great service...our meal at scarpetta was definitely one of the highlights of our vegas trip. there were a few missteps on our food adventure, but not nearly discouraging enough to detract from the overall experience. \n\nwe made reservations for 6:30 on thursday night, which seemed to be the latest time to arrive and get one of the tables overlooking the bellagio fountains. we got the last one available. the only issue with the view is that there is a giant metal bar running exactly eye level across the window, so you have to pop your head up like a little meercat just to get a glimpse of the fountains. oh well.\n\nwe ordered the tasting menu and told the waiter that we'd like a bottle of white wine, somewhere in the semi-sweet to semi dry range, full-to-medium bodied, in the $50-60 range. the waiter brought us two options to taste, and we went with a delicious riesling. the bread course came with a lovely tray of marscapone cheese whipped butter, lemon infused olive oil, and a delicious fresh tomato spread. we didn't eat too much, because we knew we had seven courses of awesome heading our way:\n\n1) the first course was <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> and tuna sushi. the <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> was served with thin pink rock salt wafers that complemented the fish perfectly. the tuna was rolled around marinated vegetables and served with preserved mushrooms. everything was light, fresh, and flavorful. an excellent way to start a meal. a <mark>Crispy Fritto Misto</mark> came on the side - the tempura fried herbs and lemon were a delicious addition to the standard tempura fare - shrimp...veggies...etc.\n\n2) the second course was a sea scallop served on top of cauliflower, with a cauliflower puree, chili oil, and a salad with capers on top. - the capers were a bit salty for my liking, so i pulled them off, and the cauliflower with the cauliflower puree was a little redundant, but oh. my. goodness. that scallop was the best i've ever had. the crust was perfectly carmelized, and the scallop inside was tender and melted in your mouth. the small trace of heat from the chili oil added an unexpected twist to the dish and really took it to another level. \n\n3) the chef added in course number three - <mark>Creamy Polenta</mark> with truffled mushrooms. my biggest complaint here is that i can never eat anyone else's polenta again. amazing doesn't even begin to describe it. my friend and i dove into this lake of creamy, buttery, savory goodness with reckless abandon, knowing full well that we were completely spoiling our appetite for the four remaining courses. if nobody had been watching, i would have licked the bowl. we took a little break before moving on in the meal.\n\n4) the pasta course was both a super high and super low note in the meal. after seeing scott conant revered as the king of spaghetti on television time after time, we finally got to see what all the fuss was about. the simple spaghetti dish was amazing. i have never had pasta so perfectly al dente. there was a bite to it that other pastas lack, almost to the point where you feel like it will stick in your teeth, but it doesn't. it was served with a fresh tomato basil sauce that was so perfect, it didn't need any fancy infused oils or architechtural garnishes. it was just pasta perfection. \nhowever, the short ribs angnolotti with brown butter horseradish sauce was just awful. the horseradish sauce blew away every other flavor on the plate, and it wound up tasting like a big plate of mustard. this is the awkward thing about not liking a dish in a tasting course - we were only halfway through the meal and we'd had such good courses previously, that we felt a little awkward sending it back...so we just moved forward with the meal.\n\n5) the next course was a <mark>Black Cod</mark> with concentrated tomato sauce and carmelized fennel. perfect crispy skin, rich, flavorful sauce, and crunchy fresh veggies - definitely a hit.\n\n6) <mark>Spiced Duck Breast</mark> with endive, cippolini onions, and a preserved orange - this dish was ingenious. the duck, endive, and onion were perfectly cooked, but it was the addition of the super thin slice of sweet preserved orange that really made the dish. \n\n7) dessert - simply outstanding - a chocolate lava cake on a streak of carmel sauce with toasted almond gelato on a bed of chocolate cookie crumbs, with a delicate twirl of chocolate as a garnish. \n\nthe only problem with this meal is that it was so delicious, there was no way you could leave anything on your plate. my friend and i polished off every dish - which left us feeling so full that we barely made it out of the restaurant.\n\nif you decide to attempt this delicious seven course food adventure - open your wallets wide - food, drinks, and tip set us back $350...but it was well worth it.", 
            "scarpetta knows how to make a girl happy.  i went there this past sunday for my very good friend's birthday dinner. she said she had the spaghetti a year ago in miami and has been dreaming about it ever since.  now i know why!\nbefore i get too far ahead of myself though, let me start at the beginning of my experience. my group was pretty large and scattered throughout the strip. a few of us were fashionably late but the hostess had no problem seating those of us who were there on time. that's uncommon for shi-shi- type places and i really appreciated it. the decor was a dark/ modern/ rustic all-at-the-same time- type of feel. very sexy place :o) plus it overlooks the bellagio fountains and the strip! nothing like enjoying a killer meal with that type of view. \nthe sommelier was a delight. he helped us pick out a wine that had the qualities we wanted without breaking the bank. we thought it was hilarious when he said \"how about this vintage\" while pointing right at the price. very classy way to help price-concerned consumers w/o announcing to the entire room that we were trying to save money.\na bread basket is usually of no consequence but, here, it was sooooo good! one roll in particular had prosciutto or salami wrapped in and it was amazing! fresh, warm, and perfect!\nwe shared a bunch of starters.  i got the <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> fully intending to share but that did not happen. it was so fresh and delicious with the shredded red onion on top that it somehow disappeared before i could send my plate around the table... oops!  i also managed to get a bite for my friend's <mark>Creamy Polenta</mark>. to. die. for. says it all.\nnext, our main course  - the spaghetti. let me preface this by saying that 6 out the 7 people in our party ordered it because my friend hyped it up so much. we were not disappointed. i normally try to stay away from carbs and i seriously cannot remember the last time i went out and actually ordered spaghetti! it was just so good! it wasn't a heavy, flowery mess of wet spaghetti strands. it was light, tasty, cooked, and sauced to perfection. ps. it was great on its own - no meatballs or anything necessary to dress it up. that is a plate i would certainly order again. \nin sum, i had a great experience. i paid ~ $100 for bread, pasta, some sashimi, and 3 glasses of wine and i still can say that it was well worth the price.  i would go back and definitely recommend scarpetta - vegas to friends!  :o)", 
            "if you want something more unique than docg then come here.\n\nhelpful staff, clean environment.  i was surprised that there was only one stall for this place.  they have an extensive wine menu.\n\ntheir bread and their dipping sauces for it were delicious. \n\n<mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> was delicious!\n\nalso ordered the\n<mark>Tuna susci</mark> not bad but i would have ordered another <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> tail instead of this\ntaglitelle \nspaghetti\nstracci \n\nif i could order one of those 3 pastas again i would pick the simple and very impressive spaghetti.  it's not just your ordinary tomato with basil spaghetti. \n\n\nthe guava sobert type of dessert was amazingly delicious!  a great surprise for the end.", 
            "after reading all the reviews here, i decided to try the fantastic pasta place that <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> are craving about.  the restaurant is located on the third floor at cosmopolitan hotel and it is an easy find once you reach there.  it's a nice high end restaurant and you can pick the window seat so you get to overlook the bellagio fountain.\n\nwe are a huge party so i get to try couple different appetizers and main dish.  i have to say, it is a total disappointment.  not to bash on their food because the food actually  taste from ok to good, but the food does not taste like the level when you are spending 50 dollars a person.  it lacks that \"wow\" factor.  \n\nto further breakdown the night, there are two things that wowed me.  first, is their salami bread, it is really tasty and you rarely see it from any other restaurant. second, is their <mark>Creamy Polenta</mark>, you need to eat it while its hot and it is delicious.\n\nhowever, all the other dishes are mediocre at best.  i ordered the duck and <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark>, and it is so salty.  i love salty food and always add extra pepper and salt on my french fries, and even i have a hard time taking on the saltiness of its duck and <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark>.  also, their tomato & basil spaghetti is very plain.  taste good if it is $15, but not at $24.  \n\none worst part is their restroom.  they have 1 female and 1 male restroom, and you can only use it one person at a time.  so, during the night, people kept waiting in line for restroom.  i understand the fact that you can exit the restaurant and there is another cosmopolitan restroom outside, but isn't it a little absurd when you have only one bathroom stall in the restaurant.  \n\noverall, it is not my best vegas restaurant experience, i would rate it somewhere between 2.5 stars to 3 stars.", 
            "came on a wednesday evening, may 9, 2012.\n\ncatching up on writing reviews, and i wish i could have forgotten about this terrible experience already.\n\nour party of 4 approached the hostess and politely asked for a table.  she looks up... no smile.  we're told the wait is about 15 minutes, and we reply it's not a problem, asking if it's ok to sit at one of the many empty seats/booths across the bar near the entrance.  she pauses before answering that it's ok (and only later do i sense that her response was a bit cold).\n\nhowever, i'm still in high spirits from having arrived in vegas that evening for extended weekend of friends and partying.  as we're led into the dining room, i marvel at the coziness.  the room is quite small, with what seemed like 3 rows of tables, with the window seats overlooking the bellagio fountains.  it's more intimate than i expected, and i immediately filed the memory as a good place to bring a date.\n\nwe're led to a circular, chic booth that had, in hindsight, almost a diner-like feel to it... but it was an upscale setting, and was something i actually enjoyed so we could eat family style.\n\nwe had chosen to dine here because arvin t had heard they had an amazing spaghetti.  but let's continue chronologically.  the bread basket came out, and it was amazing.  the stromboli was tasty, though i'm no expert, and we ended up asking them for a second basket.  the waiter was slow in bringing that second basket out, and i definitely felt like we committed a taboo... but that didn't stop us from reminding him to bring that out for us.\n\ni'd go down a play-by-play for each of the items on the menu, but, to be honest, it wasn't very impressive.  i really hoped the food was so good that i could look past the mediocre service, which bordered on indifferent.  but, alas, it cannot be said.\n\ni would still recommend this place to bring your date for a nice, intimate dinner.  the dim <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> lighting exuded a warmth that i only wished was completed by quality service i had come to expect from the cosmo...  if service isn't important to you, esp in relation to money spent, then i would still suggest giving this place a go sometime.\n\nhowever, i think of vegas as a place to escape - a sanctuary away from the hustles of life.  scarpetta let me down, and it was only the first punch in the stomach by cosmo that night.", 
            "the worst part about scarpetta is that you eventually have to leave. it was a sad moment when i took my last bite of amazingness and realized i was already having separation anxiety with my duck and <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark>. not to mention the mouth orgasm i had after over indulging in the bombolini dessert with nutella dust. (went back the following night for an encore performance ). i am not going to sit here all day and rave about how perfect the beef tartare was or how life altering the short rib angolottis were, but what i will do is tell anyone who has anything bad to say about scarpetta, you honestly don't have a clue what good food is all about. i just read 30 reviews and one person had said \"the <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark> flat out sucked\" dude stfu and have some respect. i guarantee you are the type of db that enjoys the food at olive garden. get a grip. here is my run down from a foodie who has traveled the world in search of great cuisine and spend 10 years running kitchens:\n\nservice-\nfrom the hostess to the table service, everything surpassed my high expectations. very attentive without being over bearing. luis was very sociable and you could tell he wasn't trying to up-sell anything and he gave his honest opinion when needed. very knowledgeable about the menu and was honestly fantastic.\n\nambiance-\nvery comfortable, modern atmosphere complimented by great music and bellaggio fountains.\n\nfood quality-\nfresh pasta! come on how can you complain about fresh pasta  i guess if you like rubber olive garden garbage pasta and you didn't enjoy the king of pasta's execution then your review is null.\n\noverall food experience-\nthere is only one way to sum up scarpetta so the common man can understand how great this experience is: \n\nif you like the fake bread sticks and man made olive oil at olive garden then you aren't going to like the fresh baked bread and stromboli complimented by lemon olive oil, eggplant capanata, or marscapone butter.\n\nif you like frozen pasta that been frost bitten for 2 years, then your aren't going to enjoy fresh made pasta stuffed with delicate meats such as duck or short rib.\n\nif you go to the outback and are really wowed by the meat quality then you aren't going to understand the complexity of meat that they use here. \n\nso for you complaining feeble minded <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark>, stay away from scarpetta, you do not deserve to enjoy and embrace what this amazing restaurant has to offer. to the foodies who share my same enthusiasm for this amazing restaurant, you know how excited i am to go back.", 
            "phenomenal restaurant. i've had the pleasure to dine at some pretty great places around the country and this was in the top 5. \n\nlet's start with the food. delicious. basically perfect. one down side - they were not offering the tasting menu the evening i was there. as a fan of tasting menus (especially with wine pairings!) this was disappointing. anyway, as others have mentioned, the bread is great. we also started with the short rib risotto appetizer as well as the <mark>Crispy Fritto Misto</mark>. both were delightful. as far as the entrees - myself and my 3 dining partners all got pasta. the spaghetti (again, as many other reviewers have commented on) was wonderful. i don't think i've ever ordered spaghetti at a restaurant and probably wouldn't had i not read the rave reviews on <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> (though the waiter did highly recommend it). it was simple yet extremely tasty. the only gripe i have is it seemed a little overpriced given the minimalistic dish (~$24) but was fair given the prices of other dishes on the menu. we also tried the duck and <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark> which was rich and delicious. the beef short rib pasta was also very good, though a little too horseradishy for my taste. \n\nthe food would've earned the restaurant 5 stars in my book regardless, but the service made the experience one of a kind. maybe the waiter has the same \"routine\" for everyone, but who cares? he was attentive, friendly, professional but not at all annoying. \n\nthe only bad part about the night is i didn't get to try dessert (too full)!", 
            "i *thought* i knew italian food.  i thought i had pizza and pasta figured out.\n\ni was wrong.\n\nthanks to my dinner at scarpetta, my appreciation for the sophistication of italian cuisine is vastly more than it used to be.\n\nin other words, scarpetta gave me an education in fine italian dining that i'll never forget.\n\nit all happened on a sunday night, which was the only night of the week when i could secure a table at scarpetta -- a restaurant notorious for its difficulty in scoring a reservation.  after walking through the narrow entrance hall on the third floor of the cosmopolitan hotel, i was greeted by a spacious and elegantly appointed dining room.  i was lucky enough to have a window seat directly overlooking the bellagio fountains.\n\ni quickly received a menu from my kind and gracious server, giampaolo, and found myself drooling over its mouthwatering options.  while i waited, giampaolo brought by a breadbasket with sides of citrus-inflused olive oil, eggplant tapanade, and whipped mascarpone cheese.  the breadbasket was superb -- especially the stromboli with cheese and succulent salami baked inside.\n\ni wasn't in the mood for wine, so i started by ordering of their signature cocktails -- a st. germain/prosecco spritzer.  sweet and refreshing, it was a lovely start to dinner.\n\nfor an appetizer, i had the <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> crudo.  the <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> was extremely fresh and beautifully seasoned.  i especially enjoyed that little punch of sea salt that hits you after the rest of the fish is gone.  (who said that japanese restaurants have a monopoly on <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark>?)\n\nthe real show-stopper was the entree -- duck and <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark>.  i don't claim to be a foie gras expert, but this dish was revelatory.  the ravioli dough was delicate and flavorful.  the duck and foie gras filling could only be described as pure decadence.  the sauce drizzled on top provided a beautiful contrast.  this was one of the top dishes that i've ordered in any restaurant -- ever.\n\nafter the ravioli, i was too full to order dessert, but giampaolo was still kind enough to bring over two complementary petit fours -- a cinnamon biscotti cookie and a chocolate truffle.  both were outstanding.\n\neverything about scarpetta is outstanding -- from the service, to the ambiance, to the extraordinary food.  \n\nif i could, i'd get my culinary education here every day.", 
            "after visiting scarpetta in la, i cannot wait to see what the vegas one has to offer. they serve the same menu but the ambiance there is totally different. the vegas one has a gorgeous view of bellagio's fountain and the decor is more old, rustic and not as classy and glamorous as the la one. the waiter here is very helpful and funny. \n \nthe food here is delicious:\n\n+ beef tartare: cooked with lime juice so quite sour but refreshing. very different from traditional beef tartare.\n+ <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark>: it's okay. pretty typical, but i'm surprise how non-fatty the fish taste considering hamachi is a fattier fish.\n+ the spaghetti: good as always--al dente with a sauce that's sweet with a hint of tang. \n+ tagliatelle: a pasta with spring veggies. this tasted too green and peas-filled for me. the cream sauce also too thick. \n+ duck & <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark>: this was delicious but the foie gras taste is very mild. \n+ mediterranean branzino: the fish has a really, really nice sear on the outside and it was very soft and tasty. \n\ndon't skip dessert! dessert was phenomenal! \n\n+ st<mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> tart : the tart crust was amazing! it has that crunch and the cream was so light. the meringue that came with the dessert didn't taste like basil as described, but it was still really good. \n\n+and the nutella & vanilla creme bomboloni: reminds me of hot bigne with creamy nutty chocolate center! it's so good. and i have no idea how they caramelized a banana. it has the crunch and then creaminess of the fruit.", 
            "came here for a special occasion after nora's wine bar closed.  we needed something that would wow us.  the ambiance certainly did, the service was great, and the food certainly did at times.\n\nwe did the tasting menu.  and the bottom line is that we were very happy, but not as happy as we could possibly be.  the expectation was high, and so was the price...so at the price we really needed it to come through for a 5 star rating...it ended as a 4 or 4.5 star experience for us.\n\nthere were a few items that left us wanting.  the spaghetti was good, but not the best thing i ever ate good (pasta or tomato... either way it was just above average good.)    the spaghetti was simple and lacked anything to set it off as truly amazing--coming off above-average, but slightly flat.  likewise we enjoyed the duck & <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark>, but not at the raved about level we hoped for. the raviolis were overly rich and lacking balance...we were vary happy to just have a small portion in the tasting menu.\n\nsome of our favorites were <mark>Black Cod</mark>, branzino, <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark>, and <mark>Creamy Polenta</mark> with fricassee of truffled mushrooms.\n\nwe were also happy with the bread basket...how can you not be though?...a bread basket that includes a stromboli of rolled with cheeses and salami...yes please!\n\nwe had an amazing seat overlooking the bellagio fountains.", 
            "had an interesting experience at scarpettas last night. after doing a lot of research on the internet, we made reservations there for our 21st anniversary. when we arrived we were told their kitchen was closed due to a \"mishap\" but we could order from an alternate menu. we were a little confused but decided to go ahead since we were all dressed up and ready to eat. once we were seated and looking at the menu, we realized that they were serving food from their sister restaurant next door. we were very disappointed since we've read so many good things about their food on <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark>.     then they brought out a complimentary appetizer which was very good. had the meal and then they brought us 2 delicious desserts, one had \"happy anniversary\" written in chocolate on the plate. very nice. then the big surprise came when the waiter informed us that the meal was on the house!!!  totally unexpected! maybe the waiter sensed our dissappointment earlier in the evening, but we hadn't complained at all. \n\nso... i can't give an honest review of their food. however, the fact that they gave us our meal free says a lot about how they feel about their customers. very classy.  they made things right in a big way. \n\nas for ambience... very classy, dark, contemporary and cool. they sat us by the window with a nice view of the bellagio fountains. \n\nagain, can't tell u about scarpettas food, but how can i not give them 5 stars when they treated my wife and i so well.", 
            "my girlfriend and i spent our thanksgiving holiday in vegas with our respective families.  the original plan for thanksgiving dinner was to go to caesars' bacchanal buffet, but since we were staying at the cosmopolitan, the logistics of getting the family together there scrapped that plan a.  plan b was to go to the cosmo's wicked spoon buffet, but the three-hour plus wait resulted in us scrapping that one, too.  as a result, we made our way to scarpetta since everyone likes italian (right?) and they could accommodate our party of eight without reservations at 6:30 pm on thanksgiving day for dinner.  by this point, we were just happy that we found someplace...anyplace...for dinner.  \n\nwe were seated in a nice, small, private room looking out over the bellagio's fountains to the north.  matthew, our server, was exceedingly professional and knowledgeable about the menu, offering spot on food and drink recommendations.  we started off with drinks while we looked over the menu.  i had the billionaire ($16) made with elijah craig, pomegranate syrup, pernod absinthe, and lemon juice.  frankly, the cocktail was well made and pleasing, however, for the price, i wasn't impressed with the choice of elijah craig as the base spirit unless it was for their 18 or 20 year old stuff.  of course, since they didn't specify, i assumed it was for the standard 12 year old bourbon.  for starters, the table shared an order of <mark>Crispy Fritto Misto</mark> consisting of seafood, vegetables, artichokes, herbs & lemon ($18) and an order of <mark>Creamy Polenta</mark> topped with a fricassee of truffled mushrooms ($17).  all elements of the <mark>Crispy Fritto Misto</mark> were fried to perfection, crispy, without a hint of sogginess, leaving the mix of shrimp, calamari and octopus tender.  i like polenta.  the polenta was creamy as advertised and as good a polenta as i've ever had.  that said, it was $17 for polenta...a bit pricey.  chef scott conant and his scarpetta are known for its fresh made pastas, so for my main course, i had the pici, a thick, spaghetti-like pasta, with lobster, preserved tangerine & bottarga ($36). http://www.<mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark>.com/biz_photos/scarpetta-las-vegas?select=emj-zvy2ihq8gwdluu6ipq#qpdstngpczl7isr5mb4p5g  i'd never had pici before and it was a hearty, filling pasta.  it was tossed with restraint with what i'm assuming was only olive oil, the preserved tangerine, bottarga (a dried, pressed fish roe), and tender chunks of lobster claw meat.  the pasta dish was outstanding as the flavor profile and aromatics of each ingredient were present and in perfect balance.  while it was one seriously pricey bowl of pasta, it tasted like it was worth every bite as it hit my tongue.  the gf and i split a side of roasted mushrooms consisting of trumpet royale, beech, and shitake mushrooms, topped with pecorino and trucioleto vinegar ($11) http://www.<mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark>.com/biz_photos/scarpetta-las-vegas?select=emj-zvy2ihq8gwdluu6ipq#emj-zvy2ihq8gwdluu6ipq  it was a nice plate of fungus and excellent complement to my pasta. \n\nscarpetta may not have been our first choice for thanksgiving dinner, but it was definitely a good choice.  the food was well-executed and delivered amazing flavor.  service was attentive without any hint of intrusiveness.  the only downside was that it was quite expensive and some items seemed overpriced for what was received.  still, scarpetta is a fine restaurant and perfect for a special occasion...even thanksgiving dinner.", 
            "scarpetta, located on the 3rd floor of the cosmopolitan, has roughly the same menu as its new york counterpart, including the famous spaghetti with butter - er, basil - and you can expect the same eyebrow-raising prices.  but it's delicious and, besides, you're in vegas so you clearly already hate money.  the atmosphere was relaxed, upscale and quiet, which may or may not be what you're looking for in a vegas dinner.\n\nthe service is a bit of a different story.  on the one hand, there were periods when we couldn't get anyone's attention for minutes at a time.  on the other hand, our server was overattentive whenever he was at our table.  for instance, when we were ordering, after we placed our order he would offer commentary on each dish.  this might just be a pet peeve of mine, but if i've already decided on a dish, i don't need you to tell me that it \"appears small on the plate, but the filling and the reduction are actually quite rich, so i think you'll be satisfied.\"  just say \"ok\" or nothing at all.\n\nto start i ordered the <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark>, which was incredible and i only wish there was more of it.  the sea salt was a really nice touch and i'm probably now going to be tempted to salt all of my sashimi going forward.\n\nfor my main, i had the duck and <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark>, which was similarly delicious (and enough food, i thought). according to our server, most people order three courses, but my group felt like two was enough.", 
            "surprised my boyfriend with dinner here this past saturday for his birthday. we made reservations for 7:30 and requested a table by the window. we were 5 minutes late because we had to stop by the atm which, by the way, is located right at the foot of the escalator by security. we were greeted by the hostesses and manager who were all friendly. the dining room itself was a lot smaller than i had expected. they were able to accommodate our request and we were seated at a beautiful 2 top with a perfect view of the bellagio fountains. water glasses were immediately filled and a bread basket magically appeared with 3 accompaniments: citrus infused olive oil, eggplant spread and my fav, mascarpone cheese... way better than boring butter! like everyone has already mentioned the bread basket was delish! we also got a bottle of red wine for a great price, $75. we shared everything and for some of the dishes they were actually able to split it in 2 so it would be easier to share! this was my first time tasting fresh pasta and you can most certainly taste a difference. there's a specific bite and texture that can't be compared to that dry stuff at the grocery... \n\n-<mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> tail: 4 very fresh pieces!!! love the salt sprinkled on it. and the pieces were actually pretty thick and not some skimpy thin little things.\n-<mark>Creamy Polenta</mark> with truffled mushrooms: perfect balance of creamy and sweet. i liked it because it was more like a soup for me haha\n-braised short ribs with risotto: tender chunks <mark>Braised Short Ribs of Beef</mark>. tasted like this korean short rib dish that i love. \n-duck & <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark>: my favorite dish of the night. it was so decadent and delicious. if you don't like the taste of strong cheese, you will not like this dish. the sweet marsala sauce paired perfect with it.\n-spaghetti: i'm sure some people have a problem spending $25 on a small plate of spaghetti but it definitely is something everyone should taste at least once. light, fresh sauce with perfectly aldente pasta... it is because of this dish alone my boyfriend had been wanting to come to scarpetta. he has made this recipe a couple times for me and i'm sorry to say but my boyfriend's spaghetti tastes exactly the same.. if not better. but then again my opinion may be biased haha\n-ny strip steak: it was a mistake ordering this because we were so full. we had to force ourselves to finish this dish haha at $55 though i didn't think the steak was that amazing.. it actually had some unwanted gristle on it. but i'm sure it would have tasted a lot better had we not been so full. \n\ni really wanted to get dessert for him and they were going to do something special for us but we were already so late for our show and not to mention so beyond stuffed.. we had to run out of there... literally, we ran out of there! \n\nservice was amazing all night from our server all the way down to the lady who came around with parmesan cheese and chili flakes. but special shout-out to paul k...the friendly food runner/expo who was so polite and quite knowledgeable about all of the food. \n\nthanks scarpetta! \nscott conant, you are hot \n;ppp", 
            "as much as i am critical regarding the outlandish folly that which is the strip, there are, in my opinion, a few exceptional culinary experiences that you can only get here and nowhere else; with breathtaking, majestic feats of visionary engineering, the strip personifies man's ability to create way beyond his present environment and envision a future filled with unlimited possibilities.  and when a night on the town includes that man-made wonderland, you get magic, an 'umami' of all the senses.\n\nscarpetta by chef scott conant encompasses that dining experience, and out of all his venues bearing the same name, i enjoy the vegas restaurant by far.  although all the restaurants are elegant with great food, this restaurant takes the vegas experience and showcases style with understated design gestures.  'scarpetta' means little shoe in italian, a reference to the menu's 'soulfulness'...  guess my mind wandered to other references...like, the foot fetish variety - shrimping anyone?  no? too far?\n\nthe design is deceptively tame; meaning that it's not drenched in the typical vegas gaudy, interior so-five-seconds ago gimmicks that cause visual norovirus.  but once you situate and settle down, you notice the lyrical design flow lending itself to a relaxing, calming evening. by then the fountains at the bellagio will have sprung into full effect, with sweeping side views of the lake and the beautiful architecture as a backdrop for the dynamic geysers bursts - a stunning piece of visual entertainment lasting the night.\n\nafter dining at scarpetta on numerous occasions, i've come to the conclusion that although everything on the menu is good, i naturally gravitate towards the pasta section of the menu.  i enjoy all of the home made pastas and the balance with the ingredients that chef conant pairs with them.  and to be honest, i'm just tired of entrees, they've become burdensome, overpriced and unusually large with the same old formula: big ass protein with some creamy mush underneath it with a side of blah..yawn.  if anything, i'd get some apps, but i've eaten most of them on the menu; i do recommend the <mark>Creamy Polenta</mark> + fricassee of truffled mushrooms, the heirloom beet salad and the <mark>Braised Short Ribs of Beef</mark>. (they push the <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> as their signature classic- really...if i wanted sashimi, i'd go eat at a japanese restaurant where it's served pure, you really don't need any heavy onions or olive oil or jalape\\u00f1os to mask the flavor of this delicious protein.....truth).  \n\nspaghetti + tomato +basil: an all time favorite of mine, this dish is as simple as it can get (it's up there with spaghetti all' aglio olio e pepperoncino) but so fresh and light with just a few ingredients, the pasta shines through as the main character which, being the carb addict that i am, is harmonious!  it's presented as the first dish, based on its levity and absence of protein.  \n\nricotta + truffle agnolotti: the second dish in the fete de pasta is a deep contrast to the acidity of the prior dish, the fluffy pillows filled with ricotta and covered in a light truffle cream sauce.  i love using the term 'pillows', it describes these soft chewy bite size packages of pasta like a metaphoric squishy rest to the head; that, \"ahhh\" moment when your cranium sinks into a downy cloud.....i love sleep..  the creamy truffle white sauce has just enough weight to coat your palate without any buyer's remorse and the quantity is perfect for two.\n\nblack tonarelli + king crab + coddled egg + smoked trout roe: i'm always excited when i see squid ink pasta on any menu - i relish the slightly briny noodle that goes well with all seafood toppings.  with this dish, it's even more decadent with the introduction of the coddled egg, coating every strand with a sticky liquid goo. it's such oral satisfaction.  oh, and there's crab, you really can't go wrong when there's crab.  \n\npici + lobster +preserved tangerine + bottarga: pici is thick cut pasta, a fat spaghetti, akin to udon.  it is hearty and appropriately the last pasta course of the evening.  the pici is paired with lobster, preserved tangerine and bottarga, a cured fish roe.  the bottarga amps up the salty briny element while the the juicy lobster gives a sweet delicate flavor - all the ingredients manage to balance out with the pasta.\n\ncaramella milk chocolate mousse + saut\\u00e9ed <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> peaches + praline crunch + pistachio bastoni: okay, this was a bit of a surprise-under our waiter guidance, we ordered this dessert for the first time... this plate of what can only be described as a kindergarden art project with chocolate squares and pistachio logs....  i wonder if the chefs are so bored that they need to play with the food and at the same time give us less.  and in the end, it didn't really have much flavor as compact as it was- it was like a plate of mignardises that usually come with a post-meal hot beverage.\n\nratings (out of five stars)\nfood:            4.75\nambience:    4.75\nservice:         4.5",

            "after reading all of the great reviews, i am really excited to go to this restaurant.  we made a reservation because, online it said that they were recommended, but there were not many people in the place. we got the suggested appetizer of the <mark>Tuna susci</mark> and it was delicious! the waiter even had the kitchen split it onto two plates so my boyfriend and i could share.  it was delicious with white truffles in the middle and very well seasoned. my boyfriend ordered the black squid pasta with seafood because the reviews raved about it--it really wasn't that great.  it actually smelled and tasted a little overly fishy, but he was a good sport and ate it all.  i order the <mark>Spiced Duck Breast</mark>, and the duck was cooked perfectly.  the only suggestion i have is that the duck was cut very thick and there was not enough of the delicious orange glaze.  it was good, but not over the top amazing.  we were pretty full but ordered the st<mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> shortcake for dessert---omg amazing!  it definitely made up for the mediocre dinner. the service was really great, the dinner was blah, and the dessert was really good.  i would recommend this place, but i would not come here again.  there are too many other great restaurants in las vegas, this definitely has the atmosphere but i do not think our dinner was worth 150$.",

            "scarpetta is awesome.  the food, the service, the location...i loved all of it.  yes, it is over-priced, but all vegas restaurants are over-priced, so in my mind it's all relative.  i go into it from the beginning expecting to pay more, but i also expect the restaurant to hold up its end of the bargain and give me something that doesn't make me regret spending $100 a person.  scarpetta definitely holds up its end of the bargain here, and now that i've addressed the price issue, i can write about the more interesting things!\n\nwe tried the short ribs for appetizer and spaghetti and branzino for entrees.  the short ribs were melt-in-your-mouth juicy good.  i've never had freshly made spaghetti before, and it was amazing...now i can confidently say that i really understand al dente!  the branzino, which i typically find simply prepared in other italian restaurants, had a very creative and delicious preparation.  it came as two filets (with crispy skin!) on top of a hodge-podge of seafood (baby shrimp and mussels) with some kind of seafood jus that is added at the table (interesting pink color, but very nice seafood flavor).  the mascarpone butter and citrus olive oil that accompanies the bread is delicious!  \n\ni tried a couple of cocktails, and the one that stands out the most to me was the gallardo.  i was hesitant to try it because it included apple juice (which i don't enjoy), but the waiter assured me it didn't taste too apple-juicy and he was right!  it was flavored mostly by the basil and was so aromatic and fresh...perfect accompaniment to spaghetti!\n\ni think the most amazing part of the meal was the st<mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> souffle.  i want to go back to vegas just to have it again.  i can't even describe it.  just get it and try different bites with the ice cream, rhubarb and the other sweet sauce it comes with...pure eating pleasure sensations.  we also had the bomboloni, which were very good, but at the end of the day just still  felt like donuts and weren't as special as some of the other items i tried.\n\nas mentioned by many other reviewers here, the view over the bellagio fountain is pretty sweet, and it is just so lovely right around sunset.  the interior ambiance of the restaurant is classy and fun.\n\non a side note, i am totally addicted to the show chopped and love scott conant and was so happy his restaurant did not disappoint :)", 
            "skip the primi, dive into the secondi.  scarpetta excels at pasta.\n\nwhile it is true, a recent trip to italy has forever altered my perception of italian food (the reason for the loss of a star), scarpetta delivers with an italian chic d\\u00e9cor, light spirited service, contemporary plating, and italian cooking sensibility.\n\nstraight to the pastas.  plated as a secondi (second course before the main), portions are smaller.  do like the italians, save your bread to mop up the left over sauce once you finish the pasta.  trust me, do it, you'll understand.\n\nthe tagliatelle with a truffle zabaglione and guanciale, a take on carbonara is excellent.  all the flavor of carbonara are there, just lighter. the pasta is toothsome and near perfect.\n\nduck and <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark>.  thin sheets of translucent pasta around packets of duck and melting foie.  glazed with a sweet marsala and duck stock reduction.  the sauce is enriched with dribbles of foie fat as the little packets are broken open.\n\nfinally, the spaghetti with tomato and basil is a take on amatriciana.  simple, fresh pure of tomato, hint of fresh basil.  clean flavor.\n\nalthough i'm happy with two or three pastas, most think i've gone foodie crazy so if you must, the  mains.  the <mark>Spiced Duck Breast</mark> with endive, preserved orange, and cipollini onions is excellent.  perfectly rendered, the skin of the rare duck is crisp with no cloying underlying <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark>.  it's earthy, ducky flavor cut by the sauce of preserved orange and duck jus creates a very well balanced dish.  not to be outdone, the fennel spiced <mark>Black Cod</mark>.  hints of licorice taint the delicate flavor of the cod, the acidity of tomatoes and the briny, salty flavor of olives elevate it.  unfortunately, i couldn't find the mantecato of baccala the menu promised.  all good, the dish worked.\n\ngreat wine list.  heavy emphasis on italy.  \n\nis scarpetta truly italian?  no.  (you should still tip your server; i miss italy).  it does however, deliver a great experience.", 
            "came here based on <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> reviews.  the food was delicious. the service, not so much. homemade pasta melts in your mouth.  thumbs up on the short rib pasta.  unfortunately, roberto, our server, was not very attentive to us once the food came.  had to flag down a bus boy to get our check.  decided not to give him any more business.  went across the street to mon ami gabi for my favorite bananas foster. ordered but never received my cappuccino. guess it wasn't our night for good service.  that is a discussion unto itself.", 
            "this is the best italian food i've had in this country in a very long time.  the wild mushroom polenta was creamy, rich, and very flavorful.  my husband and i went with the pasta.  he had the sheep milk ricotta agnoletti and i had the spare rib agnoletti.  both were savory and melt in your mouth good.  for dessert we had the bombolini, which were quite delicious.  \n\nthe service was excellent and i disagree with a previous <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> who said service came with a serious attitude.  our server was kind, helpful, and not at all pretentious.\n\nthe only thing that i would like to see on their very extensive wine list is more mid-range bottle options.  there were hardly any bottles of wine under $100.00.", 
            "on saturday night we were invited to scarpetta  for dinner by an old friend. we had dinner reservations at 8:30 pm and it was hard getting into the cosmopolitan hotel because of all the traffic. we got seated right next to the window overlooking the bellagio fountain. the menu is very simple. we had the following:\n\nsoftshell crabs             3/5 stars the crabs were extra large. deep fried and kinda\n                                                         greasy.\npolenta                           5/5 stars off the hook good. excellent must order!\n\nheirloom tomato salad 4/5  stars   good fresh and dressed well.\n\n<mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> sashimi           4/5  stars   4 small thinly slices pieces. normal sushi fare.\n\n<mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark>     4/5 stars ok not the gastronomic orgasm as other <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark>\n                                                              mentioned\nspaghetti                           4/5 stars excellent al dente, \n\nbarzano fish                     5/5 stars best entree' of the night well cooked.\n\ncheese cake                     4/5 stars ok small poker chip sized.\n\nst<mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> souffle'           5/5 stars amazing ! light great st<mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> flavor with a\n                                                              dollop of vanilla ice cream. \n\nif you can get a seat next to the window over looking the bellagio fountain and the las vegas strip the meal is well worth the prices. service was excellent.", 
            "what a giant disappointment. we saved scarpetta for our final night in vegas because it was my first choice of a new place to try. we won't ever return.\n\nwe had reservations at 6:30. we arrived at 6:24. i know this because the hostess pointed to the clock and noted that she would seat us in 6 minutes, since our reservation was for 6:30 pm. they were not busy -- no one else was waiting to be seated and only two people were sitting at the bar. we had to ask twice to check a coat, even though they have a clearly marked coat check.\n\nat this point, we just figured the hostess was inexperienced or having a rough day. once we were seated, we were promptly greeted and placed our cocktail orders. our drinks took almost 20 minutes to arrive -- although we could see there were fewer than 20 people in the entire restaurant and there were at least 5 servers standing around chatting. the rest of the night, the service remained scattered, at best. we were rushed through our first course, but had to flag down the server to order dessert. \n\non top of this, the server was constantly pushing us to \"upgrade,\" after telling us that most of the plates, as is, are pretty minimal and that most people end up having to add to them with a second round of orders. for example, i ordered the <mark>Crispy Fritto Misto</mark> salad, which runs $18. the server warned me i should order a second primi, as well. he wasn't kidding -- i got two bites of greens with a dusting of lemon and seasoning. in short, the portions are small even for an upscale, trendy restaurant.\n\nthis place has one saving grace: the tomato and basil spaghetti. i admit i'm pretty picky about italian food after i lived in italy for a summer. i understand that it's rarely as good in the states. although it's not as good as you'd get in italy, the tomato and basil spaghetti is done well here. it has a nice light sauce (it's not arrabbiata -- it's a pureed sauce), and the pasta was cooked perfectly al dente.\n\ni had the st<mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> souffle for dessert. it was adequate, although it was fairly cool by the time they got it to the table. the coffee was fine, but the server forgot the extra shot of frangelico i requested.\n\non the plus side, it's really beautiful. if you can get a seat in the windows, they overlook the bellagio fountains (unfortunately, the window seats also overlook the bellagio gardening sheds and dumpsters...so don't look down!). overall, the decor fits in well with the contemporary vibe at the cosmo. it's urban, beautifully designed, and hip. it's fresh, upscale, and open without being fussy or stuffy.\n\nas beautiful as it is and as great as that pasta plate was -- i won't be back.", 
            "had dinner here on a friday night in vegas.  i've seen scott conant on chopped a hundred times and he always comes across as a little too full of himself, claiming to be the master of pasta.   with this in mind i was actually looking forward to criticizing his restaurant, but i just can't.  \n\ni ordered the <mark>Creamy Polenta</mark> appetizer and shared it with the table.  it was amazing, with the truffled mushrooms blending perfectly with the polenta whose \"creamy\" descriptor in the menu is both descriptive and right on.\n\ni then ordered the duck and <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark>.  i thought it would be too rich, but the portion was just right and somehow, despite it being duck with foie gras, was not too rich.  the pasta was cooked perfectly... damn you conant.  \n\nfor dessert we had the bombolini and the st<mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> souffle, both were great, with the bombolini being the favorite for the table.  \n\nthe dinner was absolutely lovely and everything was very flavorful, in perfect portions and made just right.", 
            "i highly recommend this place. i ate here last night with a group of three others, the entire experience was wonderful. the restauraunt is beautiful and has a great view overlooking the bellagio fountains. i started with the wine list. i had read one review on <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> from a reviewer complaining there were hardly any bottles of wine under 100.00, i thought the wine menu was really varied and there were many price points to choose from, types, regions. this is a fine dining restauraunt so what do you expect. i chose a riesling from france that was perfect with our food. \n\nthe bread, holy jesus the bread. they have about four different kinds they bring out (and keep bringing). there is a roll with salami inside that is literally to die for. the bread is accompanied by mascarpone butter, citrus infused olive oil, and some sun dried tomatoe compote. all wonderful. we started with oysters that were fresh and perfect. \n\ni ordered the black fettuccine with seafood (crab, shrimp, squid) and it was incredible. this is a dish with few ingredients for a reason, fresh seafood and house made pasta really don't need many other players. i forced my boyfriend to order the special, a lamb ragu over fettuccine after we argued for five minutes (i won). this was the best ragu i have ever eaten, hands down. incredible, we inhaled it. the portions are really good, it looks small when they present your plate but there is a lot of pasta i could hardly finish mine. \n\nfor desert, you have to try the st<mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> soufle, it literally melts in your mouth. we also had these little light donuts filled with with banan creme and nutella. enough said. \n\nthe waitstaff was wonderful, very warm and attentive. our waiter was fantastic, everyone was. \n\nyou have to make a reservation ahead for this place, we landed in vegas on a wednesday and the cosmopolitan concierge had to squeeze is in.", 
            "scarpetta features a very good ambiance with a fantastic view of the  bellagio fountains. to get a great view, make sure you ask to be seated by the window upon reservation. ambience is dark, sexy and romantic, but different tables set different moods. they also have a booth section that is very secluded from the rest. \n\nstarting with the notable wine list, i decided to pair my dinner with a glass of malbec.\nshortly after, our server brought us the bread basket. the bread basket consisted of foccacia, strombolli with warm meat and cheese, bread with herb, basic rolls and sourdough. delicious!  they were served with mascarpone butter spread, citrus olive oil and eggplant spread.\n\nour server told us that they were best known for their spaghetti. hmmm, must try that next time. for appetizer, we started with the <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark>. \nfor our entrees, we ordered the <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark>  and prime ny steak.\nthe <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> was very tender and refreshing. used of rock salt gave it a unique after taste. i only wish there was more of it since it only came with 4 pieces. \nthe duck and <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark> was alright.   i absolutely wanted to love this dish due to the presence of foie gras, but i could barely taste the foie gras. the marsala reduction was a delightful contrast to the ravioli. \nthe steak was cooked to perfection. medium rare, the way i like it. however, i can't say that it was the best i've ever had. not even on my top three list.  it was served with seasonal vegetables such as carrots, tomatoes, roasted potatoes, wild mushrooms and parmigiano. we were told the  mushrooms were shitake , trumpet royale, beech, and pecorino mushroom. \n\nsince we were sharing everything, they were very accommodating by splitting everything for us.  the food timing was excellent! i wish i had more room for dessert but i was too full by the end of my meal.\noverall, i enjoyed my dining experience at scarpetta.", 
            "was here this past year for ces, and we had 2 events here.\none was our company dinner in the private room with a view of bellagio fountains and the other was a upper management meeting with a client over wine tasting in the private seating area which is in the kitchen.\n\nfor the wine tasting, it was pretty awesome, except the room is probably equipped to seat 8 people comfortably, maybe 10, we squeezed in 12.  we enjoyed some awesome wines and some desserts, which hey mistakenly sent to our table, so they ended up comping those and bringing more, it was very good.  \n\nthe cool thing about this private room, is that you have to walk through the kitchen to get to it and it is located next to the kitchen, with glass floor to ceiling so you can see into the kitchen as they work and cook and the background is a view of the bellagio fountains and the strip.  \n\nthe second occasion was for our company dinner a few nights later since they were able to accommodate our group of 16 in the private dining room that is in front of the restaurant and our big boss loves italian food.  \n\nalthough you can order single entrees off the menu, we had our waiter set up our dinner family style with some of his recommendations and some of the things we wanted to try.  \n\nalso, our big boss had a request for something off the menu and the chef obliged with no problems.  keeping the boss happy is always key!\n\nwe had the following dishes.\napps - braised short rib <mark>Braised Short Ribs of Beef</mark>, <mark>Creamy Polenta</mark>, <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> and <mark>Tuna susci</mark>\nthe short ribs and the polenta were my favorite, the susci was just ok.\n\nentrees - duck and <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark>, <mark>Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti</mark>, sheep milk ricotta agnolotti.  all were awesome, but the duck and <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark> is very rich.\n\nwe had dessert, but i don't actually remember what i had.\n\nservice was great and except the bar was slow, so they comped certain drinks that didn't show up in a time fashion.\n\nthe minus one star was for the sommelier, who seemed to enjoy the sound of his own voice and didn't really consider the requests of the guests at the table.  i understand he is very knowledgeable and he is an expert, but he could dial back the ego and work with the guest.  \n\nother than that, great place, i recommend it and you will not be disappointed.", 
            "a bachelorette party visit to scarpetta was by happenchance.  ok, i was wearing sky high heels and since there is no golf cart service to shuffle the ladies around...i canceled the she/morton rezzies for new ones at scarpetta which the group agreed to after checking out all the lovely shoes at the cosmopolitan!  \n\nplus who doesn't want to dine in style with housemade pasta?\n\ni think the folks here were trained at the school of le bernadin since they were on pointe with service.  you aren't supposed to notice how many interactions you actually have but they scored big.  i notice but i'm a foodie fanatic.\n\nloved that they gave white napkins for white dresses and black napkins for dark dresses.  the ladies can attest to the lint nightmare.  \n\nboo!: ask for a view! i failed to so we didn't have the bellagio view. (for next time).\n\nbread:\ninsert triple toe curl for the bread selection and i'm not a gluten freak.  i would make out with the pastry chef just for the bread alone.\n\nappetizers and entrees:\n- the bride to be was in bliss with her veal duo.\n- i loved my foie gras pasta - it was not salty like other <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> have mentioned. and i'm sodium sensitive.\n- every gal pretty much loved their dish from short rib to lobster pasta.\n- the only mini ding was that the calamari was way too spicy for my liking.\n\nwine list is lovely and affordable for vegas.  \n\nwe would have stayed longer for more foodie adventures but our  group had more stops to make that night.  scarpetta is a solid date night spot or whenever you want to be pampered.\n\ntip: the lighting is kind on the eyes.  no botox required.", 
            "great atmosphere, great service and great food.  who could ask for more?  and we didn't even have any of chef scott conant's famous pasta.  if so, this would probably be the first 6-star rating on <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark>.\n\nnot cheap but definitely worth the money.  an experience i would gladly do over and over again!", 
            "damn this was such a good meal!  my friends and i dined here for restaurant week 2013 and all of us, but one, ordered off the restaurant week menu.  it all began when i made reservations on open table, courtesy of the <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> app on my iphone.  i didnt have any preference of where we sat, but where the hostess sat us was remarkable!  we got a window seat facing the bellagio, so not only did we enjoy a delicious meal, we also got to enjoy a fantastic view of the strip, the bellagio, and also the bellagio fountain show all at once!  now this was a meal to remember!  service was top notch, there were no disappointments there; the waiter we had was very attentive and helpful in helping us make our selection from the menu.  \n\ncourse 1: <mark>Braised Short Ribs of Beef</mark> short rib - very tender pieces of sliced beef on top of what they called a risotto (not the traditional type of risotto) but it was still delicious!  the \"risotto\" was basically diced pieces of vegetables which supported the 3-4 pieces <mark>Braised Short Ribs of Beef</mark> on top.  very good combination of flavors and textures.  very impressed.  \n\nbefore the second course came, we were all scarfing down their stromboli bread which is complimentary with our meal!  it came with other bread, which were not that memorable.  the bread was also served with three types of spreads, an eggplant marinara spread, olive oil, and something else i cannot remember. on a side note, one of my friends even asked the waiter to bring an entire basket filled with the bread, which he did!  that made her evening! haha.  \n\ncourse 2: jidori chicken - now i didn't know what a jidori chicken was, so i asked the waiter.  this whole time, i thought it was the way the chicken was cooked!  but instead, it is the type of chicken used to make the chicken, like using kurabuta pork.  i can definitely tell the difference with kurabuta pork and regular pork, but this jidori chicken was a bit more difficult to tell the difference from regular chicken, besides the fact that this chicken was moist throughout!  maybe that's what makes jidori chicken so good?  well, next time i will know! =d  \n\nnot only did i have the second course as my main meal, i had to try their handmade spaghetti everyone raves about!  so i ordered a dish for everyone to share!  in conclusion, it was pretty damn good.  what makes it good is the noodles!  the texture is not too over or undercooked, but just right!  i guess the handmade pasta really makes a difference in a pasta dish!  \n\ncourse 3: <mark>Chocolate Cake</mark> with salted caramel ice cream - now how can you end a meal without dessert!?  my stomach was so distended prior to the second course, but i had to taste everything!  by the time dessert came, i swear i have a second stomach!  i devoured not only my dessert, but my friends dessert too!  she ordered the stuffed donuts with nutella....what?! nutella in fried dough?  yes!  nuff said. ;-)  \n\ni'd definitely come back to scarpetta again!  quite pricey for a student like myself, so probably come again with my family, during restaurant week, or when i start making the big bucks!", 
            "after reading all the great <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> reviews we picked this place for my wife's birthday. here is your ex-elite <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> renegade review.  i hope it is good enough for you.\n\nour waiter helped with the wine list and led us in the right direction.  huge win, you shouldn't have to study beforehand to be able to order wine.\n\nthe bread is in fact good. but remember when you review a restaurant that knowing the bread is good is not actionable info.  actually by knowing this i ordered a strong drink knowing the bread could save me, so good tip.\n\nthe appetizers we had were rich, interesting that all of them looked rich. polenta was good.  crab corn chowder was great because it came as a plate of just crab - where's the chowder? they pour it on right in front of you, that's where. fun and effective, lots of nice flavors all stood out. the appetizers were big.\n\nso then we tried the spaghetti because of the <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> reviews. it's tomato basil sauce on spaghetti. everyone who raves about it is questionable. have you ever had spaghetti with tomato basil sauce before? it is like that but over twenty dollars. ours was super salty which i didn't like. this dish would be chopped for sure.\n\nwe had two fish dishes both were pretty good but the fennel <mark>Black Cod</mark> was the best, cooked just through.\n\ndessert was 5 huge doughnut balls and really surprised me. simple and delicious. they were perfectly done. not a thing wrong. super satisfying. service had ramped back up for dessert.\n\nthe setting is sweet. windows overlooking the bellagio fountains. cool looking wine cellar. plan your visit to be there through sunset as the strip lights come on.  it had a comfortable relaxed atmosphere but still classy.  we had a lot of fun.  i'd go again.", 
            "with so many cooking competition shows out there, i've always been curious how good some of these renowned chefs and judges really are.  certain guys clearly have the cred to back it up, but there are others i'm not as familiar with.  chopped's scott conant was one of the latter, but i can now say, without a hint of doubt, that...\n\nscott conant is bad ass.\n\nalthough it may not have been the original scarpetta in ny, my meal at this location was still pretty fantastic.  i'd even say they rank as one of my all around favorite restaurants, along with the spence in atlanta and state bird provisions in san francisco.  honestly, everything we had was terrific.  it's also easy now to see why scott conant is so tough on contestants who dare to cook pasta on the show - scarpetta's ranks as the best i've had thus far!\n\n-- bread basket...complimentary\n(http://www.<mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark>.com/biz_photos/scarpetta-las-vegas?select=dpyovdlwt4wm9gcaxo59yw#hyft6dlcgha332ecjchzlq)\nnot normally something i would bother mentioning because bread is bread.  that is, unless it's got salami baked into it.  well played scott conant, well played.\n\n-- roasted diver scallops with morels, sugar snap, watermelon radish and pea froth...$23\n(http://www.<mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark>.com/biz_photos/scarpetta-las-vegas?select=dpyovdlwt4wm9gcaxo59yw#v_vestj9d5uur3salouvza)\nmy friend and i split an order and our server was kind enough to have it plated separately for us.  the scallop had a near perfect sear (could have been harder) and the center couldn't have been cooked any better - soft and tender.  the pea froth complemented the scallop's sweetness quite well.\n\n-- <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark> with a marsala reduction...$27\n(http://www.<mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark>.com/biz_photos/scarpetta-las-vegas?select=dpyovdlwt4wm9gcaxo59yw#rj2lg-ukltloss3cpgcryq)\nsimply fantastic.  i was already dead set on ordering this, but it was nice to find out it was one of their signature dishes.  the ravioli was amazing - silky and tender with just the right bite.  although the foie gras filling was awesome on its own, the marsala reduction made it that much better!\n\n-- <mark>Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti</mark> with brown butter, horseradish, and toasted breadcrumbs...$26\n(http://www.<mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark>.com/biz_photos/scarpetta-las-vegas?select=dpyovdlwt4wm9gcaxo59yw#x9wafdf-qarvghjn7g-iya)\nmy friend ordered this one and it gave the ravioli a serious run for its money.  the pasta was just as good in this dish and the short rib added a nice bit of savoriness.  the breadcrumbs didn't do a ton for me, but it still tasted great.\n\n-- st<mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> souffl\\u00c9 with a rhubarb compote and vanilla gelato...$11\n(http://www.<mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark>.com/biz_photos/scarpetta-las-vegas?select=dpyovdlwt4wm9gcaxo59yw#uugjpj3_-6a9_rbmptbrsa)\nnot to gush like a little girl, but damn this was good!  i thought the compote and gelato would be too much sweetness, but the dish had just the right amount of sweetness and the souffl\\u00e9 had a perfect consistency.  i honestly don't know what else to say other than that you must get this.\n\nwhile the meal itself was amazing, i thought some of the hostesses could really use an attitude check.  for some reason, they seem to think they're better than everyone else and do very little to hide it.  it seems other <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> have left with the same impression, but at least our waiter christian and the rest of the wait staff more than made up for it.\n\nbeyond the food and service though, scarpetta might be worth a trip just to take in the view!  the dining room area (not the bar section) has giant bay windows that face the bellagio fountains and the strip (http://www.<mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark>.com/biz_photos/scarpetta-las-vegas?select=dpyovdlwt4wm9gcaxo59yw#3ol0vvlkty4ygbugubi7cw).  unfortunate i was only there with a friend instead of a girlfriend though (sorry bud).  scarpetta, i'll definitely be seeing you again during my next trip to vegas.  and considering how often i seem to be there, it'll probably be a lot sooner than later!", 
            "so while at a convention in vegas, my two co-workers and i came here for dinner on 10/6/13 on a recommendation from a friend who claimed it's the best restaurant in the city. all three of us did the tasting menu ($110 per person) and two of us opted for the wine pairing with it (additional $45 per person). with all the delicious looking options on the menu, it seemed this was the way to go. here's what was included: \n\n-duo of <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> and tuna \"susci\". wine pairing: adami, prosecco, veneto, n/v. the \"susci\" was the first tasting and my least favorite of all. nothing special to me. or at least i didn't get what was supposed to be special about it. the roll with the carrots was kind of gross actually. i was hoping things would turn around quickly, and they did. ohhhh they did.\n\n-roasted diver scallops, morels, sugar snap, watermelon radish & pea froth. wine pairing: iberian remix, albarino, edna valley 2009. \nthe scallops were cooked perfectly and i enjoyed the puree that was served on the side. my friend however didn't enjoy the wine that was paired with it. he's a big albarino drinker and said it tasted like \"it was sitting on the shelf a little too long.\" i didn't really notice that until he said it, but i have to agree. that could have just been a bad bottle though and not an accurate representation of the wine itself.\n\n\n-spaghetti tomato basil & <mark>Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti</mark>. wine pairing: il poggione, rosso di montalcino, tuscany 2008. i don't care what anyone says- the spaghetti was fantastic. i'm drinking the kool-aid here. yes, the sauce is very simple, but it really made me notice and appreciate the texture and freshness of the noodles more. sometimes spaghetti is better when it's simple i guess. i would definitely order it again. \n\nthe <mark>Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti</mark>- dish of the night. the three of us unanimously agreed on this. one of the best pasta dishes i've ever devoured in 10 seconds. the horseradish breadcrumbs were a great finishing touch.\n\n-fennel spiced <mark>Black Cod</mark>, concentrated tomatoes, mantecato & black olive oil. wine pairing: jermann red angel, pinot noir, friuli 2008. \nthe cod was spiced well, but maybe a tad undercooked for my liking. i still finished it. \n\n-<mark>Spiced Duck Breast</mark>, endive, preserved orange &\ncippollini. wine pairing: feudi di san gregorio, rubrato, aglianico, campania 2009. the duck was perfectly cooked and had tremendous flavor. my friend sitting next to me was already so stuffed by this point, that he couldn't eat his, so being the fat fuck that i am, i ate his too.\n\n-amedei <mark>Chocolate Cake</mark> toasted almond gelato. wine pairing: quinta do noval, colheita, tawny port, portugal 1997. i'm normally not a big dessert guy, but this cake was outstanding. perfect way to cap off the tasting.\n\n...and here were a few complimentary items our table was given to share:\n\n- bread basket. it was served with three different dips (citrus olive oil, tomato-eggplant, and marscapone butter). some of the pieces of bread had salami baked into it, and those were amazing! just try not to fill up on them if you're doing the tasting menu, because you have a lot of food on the way.\n\n- <mark>Creamy Polenta</mark> with fricassee of truffled mushrooms. the polenta was definitely one of the highlights, although it could have benefited from being a tad thicker since the mushroom sauce liquified it significantly, once mixed  in. but great flavors, nonetheless.\n\n- shoe string calamari and zucchini. i think there was some fennel in here too. we finished every last string.\n\n\nall three of us immensely enjoyed the tasting menu. to say that we were not left disappointed by the portion sizes would be an understatement. we could barely walk out of there without toppling over. i certainly didn't have much room for alcoholic beverages for the remainder of the night. probably a good thing, knowing me and vegas.\n\nyou might notice i didn't have much to say about the wines. that's because unlike the food, they were all pretty unremarkable. i'm a pretty avid wine drinker and i didn't recognize any of these wines by name before they were poured for me, so it was almost expected. if i ever did the tasting menu again, i'd most likely skip the wine pairing option and just order a bottle of something decent and familiar off their wine menu. \n\nmy biggest gripe about this place was the waiter. although friendly and accommodating, he could barely be heard over the background noise, and with his thick accent, it made him very difficult to understand. tastings obviously are supposed to be interactive and i had to ask him to repeat everything he said at least once. this became a little frustrating and kind of depreciated the experience for me. i wish he had left a copy of the menu on our table so i didn't have to go to their website afterward to finally discover what some of the things i ate were.\n\nthe bottom line is i would definitely return to scarpetta, especially since i just realized there is one in beverly hills (doh!).", 
            "one of the best meals i've had in a long time....appropriately priced and amazing quality. the ambiance is amazing and the staff there is impeccably trained. even the bread (with the variety of spreads) will knock your socks off. just make sure to save room for the actual entrees...\n\nthe duck and <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark> is their signature dish and reasonably so. it's amazing. delicate and refined is probably the best way to describe it. \n\ncolorado lamb was amazing. the lamb was not gamey at all and the different components of the dish worked in harmony. i will admit that i still like the colorado lamb from stage restaurant in honolulu...\n\ni remember one of my friends having a really delicious pasta (mint infused?) but i can't remember all the details regarding it. i just remembered it was heavenly. \n\nst<mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> souffle was amazing. light, aromatic, and slightly sweet. it blew my socks off and definitely put maison akira's souffle to shame. \n\nzeppole are ahh-mayyy-ziing. deep fried dough nuggets (so light and airy!) filled with a rich nutella center. even if you're full, you need to get these...or you will regret it forever. \n\ndefinitely a great place to hit up for a bite to eat when you're in vegas. i definitely will be returning during my next trip!", 
            "this place has ruined me. i'm never going to be able to eat dried pasta again, only the fresh stuff for this girl. but seriously, they must have italian grandmas cranking out homemade pasta by the pound. easily the best italian food i've had. definitely an upscale place. i've had several food items (spaghetti, foie gras and <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark>, ribeye, multiple glasses of wine, <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark>, pici, short ribs, and the dessert doughnuts) and every single thing is delicious. service is perfect, i was never in want of anything. servers are knowledgeable and passionate about what they're serving. also wonderful wine recommendations. something that i din't expect is getting the best steak i've had in this city here. their ribeye is without a doubt the finest piece of red meat i've had in my life. if stk is too busy (it is), but you still want a great steak, come on over to scarpetta. you will not be disappointed. another great thing to mention is the view. wanna wow your lady with a great view of the bellagio fountains? make a reservation and request it.", 
            "my family and i dined here in nov and ordered an array of dishes. i forgot our waiter's name but he was a tall slender gentleman w. a beautiful smile. his service was very memorable. he was knowledgeable w. the menu and i ordered one of his recommendations;\n\n<mark>Creamy Polenta</mark>: creamy and rich!\n\nsicilian-<mark>Spiced Duck Breast</mark> with preserved orange, root vegetables and caramelized endive. i was pleasantly surprised. \n\nduck & <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark>- rich rich rich and flavorful. \n\nmediterranean orata- very light and flavorful. the fish skin was crispy and the meat was moist.\n\nthe dinner was good but it was the desserts that made it great!\n\nthe st<mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> souffle and it was delish!! -i wish i could remember the name of the other desserts because they were all really out of this world too. \n\nthe dinner was ok but hats off to the pastry chef and our fantastic waiter!",

            "i took my wife here for her 40th birthday and they knew we were coming and the reason. \n\nthis was our first time here. we arrived minutes after 9pm.\n\nthe restaurant was dimly lit. the atmosphere was loud. nothing romantic about this setting at all. \n\nhostess\n\nher greeting was like listening to an answering machine. we had a 9:30 reservation (90 min before closing) and got sat in front of a pillar. i could not see the bellagio fountains that seems to influence everybody's reviews. about 20 min later, 2 tables opened up that were right against the glass. in my reservation i let them know it was a special occasion. \n\nserver\n\nlike the hostess, it was like watching blue man group after 3 straight performances. \n\njust going through the motions. \n\nwe were not interested in cocktails or wine, but were focused on some great cuisine. the server did stop once to go over the menu, but all he did was say \"these are the apps, these are the pastas, these are the main courses\" etc. etc. they must get a lot of people who never viewed a menu before. \n\nwe ordered the misto fritto, farmers salad, fennel <mark>Black Cod</mark>, and wrapped <mark>Veal Loin</mark>. (i did not take any pictures this time, i did not want my review to be a distraction of the occasion) \n\nfood\n\nmy wife loved the complimentary bread which included dippers of olive oil, roasted eggplant and tomatoes, and truffle butter. the bread was varieties of an italian sourdough, foccacia, stromboli, and a vegetable stromboli. \n\nthey automatically split our app & salad which i appreciated. \n\nmisto fritto\n\nthe menu description was very vague, but i figured it had to be a spin off of fried calamari. tempura battered squid, white anchovies, cauliflower, and the stems of chives. there were no anchovies in my plate, and happened to be my wife's first bite on her's which she did not like at all. i would not have known about the anchovies (which i love) if i did not finish her plate. the fry was perfect, and i really liked the seasoning which included rosemary. \n\nfarmers salad\n\nthe presentation was beautiful. some of the vegetables (green & <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> squash) were almost shaved. it was a nice salad, but not much flavor. there were only 2 choices of salad on the menu and i chose this one. my wife ate only half of hers. \n\n<mark>Veal Loin</mark>\n\nthere is a picture of this dish in the archives. 3 (2oz?) wrapped pieces of veal perfectly cooked. a few pieces of carrots and another vegetable. i tasted some sort of mustard on this dish with another sauce. the menu (again) was very vague. as i ate, i was wondering what the expense was in making this dish that carried a $38 price. \n\n\n<mark>Black Cod</mark>\n\npresentation was standard, looked to be about a 5oz filet. my wife was half way through her dish without a sound. knowing my wife, this means she did not want to disappoint me in saying she did not care for it. i tried a bite and thought it was weird for cod to be so mushy. it was not pleasant at all. maybe even undercooked. \nmy wife at all the vegetables and there was half of the filet sitting alone on the plate when the busser took it away. sad that no one noticed that half of what was supposed to be the hero of this dish was being tossed out like a used tissue. \n\nwe passed on dessert because to me, dessert should be the perfect finish to a perfect meal which this whole experience was not. my wife liked the complimentary bread the best and i liked the <mark>Crispy Fritto Misto</mark> the best. there was some woman in a very loud group making noises that reminded me of farm animals in heat. \n\nit shouldn't be this way in a restaurant of this price point.   \n\ni asked for the check (1app, 1 salad, 2 entrees) $116.00 \n\nas we were getting up to leave, a person came by with a dish that said happy birthday and had 2 biscotti\"s , a cookie, a salted chocolate thingy and a lit candle.\n\nwould have went better with a cappuccino but the check was already paid. \n\nthis was a disappointing experience, even more so because i wanted it to be special for my wife's 40th. she liked the complimentary bread.....\n\nif i can say something positive and relative, i would recommend going to d.o.c g. instead. same chef, different menu. been there 5 times and loved it.",

            "i am a fan of scott conant from chopped fame but i have to say the las vegas outpost of his iconic nyc restaurant just did not live up to the hype.  i went with a group of guys and we ordered the tasting menu.  they were nice enough to allow us to order it on a friday night since it is usually not offered on that night of the week.  we tasted 8 dishes for $110 pp.  the quantity of food was great - really full at the end of the meal - but most of the dishes were just ok.\n\nthe real highlight for me was the <mark>Creamy Polenta</mark> with truffled mushrooms.  wow, that was delicious.  probably the creamiest polenta i've ever had and it paired so nicely with the earthiness of the truffles and mushrooms.   the <mark>Chocolate Cake</mark> served for the dessert course was also terrific, served with toasted almond gelato.  too bad i was so full by that time i could only have a couple of bites.  nothing else was particularly memorable.  \n\ndisappointing for me was the restaurant's signature spaghetti - a seemingly simple preparation of pasta, fresh tomatoes and basil.  it arrived very simply plated -  a perfect cylinder mold of spaghetti covered by a clear plastic cloche that i suppose is meant to preserve the freshness of the preparation or perhaps to concentrate the aroma.  the cloches are removed with a flourish releasing nice smells of tomato and basil.  the pasta was a bit overcooked and the sauce, while wonderfully creamy (how do they do that?) was just too sweet, as if chef conant and chef boyardee had a bastard love-child.\n\nanother disappointment was the <mark>Black Cod</mark>.  in the past i have found this fish to be among the most delicious owing to its high fat content and buttery texture and flavor.  scarpetta's rendition of this fish, pan-roasted with concentrated tomatoes and roasted fennel, was so overcooked that it was unrecognizable as <mark>Black Cod</mark>.  just a piece of fish.\n\nother dishes were a bit more successful including the <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> of <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> and tuna, the diver scallops, the short rib/<mark>Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti</mark> and the <mark>Spiced Duck Breast</mark>.\n\nthe wine list is voluminous and expensive.  the cocktail menu offers some nice selections.\n\nthere is certainly a lot of eye candy to be enjoyed at this swank place in the cosmo.  however, one annoying thing was the lighting.  over every table there is a large fixture containing multiple <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark>/gold colored lights.  this lighting casts the food in a weird color and makes taking pictures of the food impossible.  all the food looks bad in the pictures i took - i suppose that's no surprise that the pictures were a disappointment too.",

            "one word: delish!!! although i feel their customer service is not up to par. since one is paying big bucks, one should expect great service. on <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> the restaurant indicated it closes at 11pm; when i called the person on the phone (female) stated they'll close at 10:30 if it's slow.... ahh... this is vegas", 
            "the entire experience was wonderful. the waitstaff was charming and attentive and very well informed about their food. when i mentioned i was vegetarian, i was provided with a special vegetarian menu, with a couple of additional items not on the regular menu. (this is not exactly a positive. put all your dishes on the menu. i mean, you aren't actually starting to cook your farro for the farro risotto when a random vegetarian offers it, right?)\n\ni was d<mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> to the restaurant by the marketing copy. (it's impressive!) the burrata salad made me add it to my very short -must-try-while-in-vegas list. and it did not disappoint. i have a running pet peeve about chintzy servings of burrata, and this is possibly the first place i've eaten that provided a balanced proportion of tomato and burrata. the variety of heirloom tomatoes, served roasted, and fresh, was a wonderful surprise. and there was enough burrata (lightly salted with shaved crystal salt) for every bite of the dish. divine.\n\ntwo other stellar standouts (aside from the view of the bellagio fountain show) were the olive oil served with the table bread-- some of the best i've ever had-- and the dessert. we split the bomboloni, and it was divine. my description will not do it justice, but i'll try. essentially, 5 small donuts covered in crystal sugar, and filled with nutella, served with a heavenly banana gelato.\n\nall that, and in a peaceful oasis of a casino hotel that barely forces you to cross the casino floor, and makes it easy to enter and leave the building. i'll be back, should i find myself in vegas ever again.", 
            "was here with a large group (bachelorette party) and we got the tasting menu with wine pairing.\n\nexcellent food in general. favorites were <mark>Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti</mark>, scallops, and <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark>, as well as the duck (though it was at the end and we were so full already we hardly ate any)\n was underwhelmed only by the spaghetti dish (why am i filling up on something i could have cooked at home?). the rest of the dishes were superb, down to the port and lava cake-esque dessert.", 
            "its killing me to give this place 3 stars. i really wanted to love this place. i watch chopped and have mad respect for scott conant. every single foodie i know has recommended his very simple yet delicious spaghetti dish to me. so, we ordered it as an appetizer and boy were we disappointed. the taste was wonderful but the pasta wasn't cooked right (ironic i know since he dings people on this very issue). \n\nwe told the server our pasta was a lil too al dente and he quickly corrected me that fresh pasta can't be al dente. i continued to clarify that its a big tough in the center and doesn't taste like its cooked all the way through. i completely understand that pasta should still have a touch bite to it but this was practically <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> the inside. like i said before i really wanted to love this dish and the server made me feel really stupid for not \"getting\" how pasta should be cooked. the restaurant took the spaghetti off our bill which was really nice but i wish they'd offer us a redo of the dish. \n\nregardless, i haven't given up hope just yet. every restaurant (even awesome ones) can have an off day. i do wish the server was a bit more understanding but what-ya gonna do right? anyways, hope to try scarpetta again and love the spaghetti.", 
            "i was very excited to dine here  for my first night in las vegas. when we arrived, the hostess was quite snarky when we requested to move one table over from her suggested table. although the service was friendly, not once were our waters refilled nor was the table cleaned before the arrival of our dessert which you come to expect when dining at a place like this. \n\nfor our appetizer, we split the spaghetti. decent but from my own personal dining experiences, the spaghetti did not warrant the hype. for our entrees, the bf and i dined on the duck  and short rib ravioli. we seriously could have passed on these two dishes.  they were forgettable and only made us reminisce about similar versions of these dishes that we had in the past which were not only better but cheaper. for dessert we ordered the st<mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> souffl\\u00e9. by the time the dish arrived  the gelato on top had already melted adding to the mush of butter and bread within the ramekin. \n\nall in all the best part of the meal was the complimentary bread. while i will not return, i can see aspects of scarpetta that some foodies may enjoy.", 
            "i have dreamt about eating the spaghetti here for years. for years. and when that spaghetti and i finally met and dined together, it did not disappoint. the spaghetti noodles are cooked to an al dente. rather than the spaghetti sauce poured on top, the noodles are simmered and cooked with simple sauce. the starch from the noodles holds onto the flavors bringing together the noodles and sauce. the spaghetti here is divine.\n\nin addition to the spaghetti, our table also shared the <mark>Creamy Polenta</mark> with truffled mushrooms, the <mark>Braised Short Ribs of Beef</mark>, and the <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark>. all of which were equally as good.\n\nthe service was subpar. our table had to constantly flag our waiter down. for a fine dining establishment, i felt like we were jipped. on top of the inattentiveness, my friend encountered a shard of plastic/glass in her salad. lemme tell you, whatever she bit into was hard. hard. everyone at the table felt it and indeed, the shard was tough and hard. we sent the dish back to the kitchen and the chef simply said that we were mistaken and that shard was actually just a piece of hard sea salt....uh. okay. clearly that piece of salt sea did not melt in my friend's mouth and it was hard. sea salt my ass.\n\nthe food is good, but go to the one in beverly hills. this place sucks. and maybe they cater toward out of towners who don't know any better, but for the vast majority- we know what fine dining should look and feel like and this certainly is not it.", 
            "<mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> fail. \n\nthis was my girlfriend's first time in las vegas, so i wanted to bring her to an upscale place and have her try some food from supposedly exclusive restaurants in vegas. based on the <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> reviews, and time availability, i chose scarpetta. it was a major disappointment, and i felt so bad bringing her to this establishment. this was the first restaurant experience she had in vegas and it was horrendous. \n\nlet me say that this review is based on three dishes that we had at scarpetta. \n\n1. duck and <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark> (main course)\n2. <mark>Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti</mark> (main course)\n3. roasted diver scallops (appetizer)\n\nambiance:\n\nthe seating and view were great. we were the table almost next to the window where the belagio water show was going on. there was a great view of the show. the lighting was also dim. it is definitely a nice place to bring a date.\n\nprice:\n\ndespite the $$$, the prices are not too outrageous for las vegas. the main course dishes were 25 and 26 dollars while the roasted scallops were 23 dollars. \n\nservice:\n\nservice was horrible. we were there for over an hour. our waiter checked up on us twice, once to bring more water and the second time to see if our food was ready. we waited for about 15-20 minutes to get our scallop appetizer. no apologies or more complementary bread. the wait for the food seemed the norm, as the tables next to us finished their food and were just making small talk while waiting for over 20 minutes. after we finished our scallops, we proceeded to wait another almost 30 minutes for our main course. again, no apologies or further check ups. i ran out of water while waiting for our main course, during the appetizer, and did not get a refill until i had to ask for one (after the main course came). when we wanted to tell the waiter about the problems with our main courses, he and other waiters could not be found for about 20 minutes. we just sat there looking at each other and our plates (almost untouched). simply horrible.\n\nfood:\n\nscallops - these were actually very good. they were simple scallops that were fresh and cooked well. i would definitely get this again.\n\nduck and <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark> - came out cold, tough, and very very very salty. we have had foie gras before, and this was well beyond what it was supposed to taste like. it left a bitter and salty taste in the mouth that could only be drowned out by eating the complimentary bread with their house tomato sauce. my girlfriend did not want to waste food so she tried to put the ravioli in her mouth followed by water as a chaser. she soon became sick and had to go to the bathroom. she only finished about 1/3 of the plate before i told her to stop. \n\n<mark>Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti</mark> - gross. the noodles were tough and cold. the sauce made the bread crumbs stick to the noodles and caused the noodles to stick together like one giant pasta. i had trouble eating one bite of it. after finally taking a bit, the food was bland and left an unpleasant aftertaste. it was one of the worst dishes i have had in a long time. i am usually not too picky with pasta, but this agnolotti was inedible. the noodles were rubbery hard and the sauce was cold and crusted onto the noodles. the appearance did not help. the food looked like someone threw up on the plate. the sauce was black or very dark brown (could not tell because of the dim lighting), but the appearance made the food even less appetizing. \n\nconclusion of the meal:\n\nafter about 20 minutes of the food being on the plate, almost completely untouched, the waiter came by to ask \"how was everything tasting.\" i told the waiter that the food was inedible and that it was probably the worst thing i've had in recent memory. the waiter's face was priceless. he did not seem shocked at all, rather, he just appeared to be apologetic. the waiter took the food off our table and asked if we wanted anything else. at this point, the restaurant was about to close and we did not want to wait another 30 minutes to get some inedible food. i told him to just give me the check so we can get out of there. they took the two dishes off our bill and our almost 2 hour meal came out to a whopping $23 (for the scallops). what a waste of time and appetite.\n\nthis trend of inedible food was not isolated to only our table table. while waiting for our food, the table behind us asked for the check and had two dishes that were inedible and left untouched as well. i did hear that the fish was decent from the table behind us, but that was the extent of praise scarpetta's food received. \n\noverall:\n\ni felt the need to write a long rant about this place. this dinner was supposed to be a happy and memorable event for my girlfriend because it was her very first dinner in vegas. instead, it was only memorable because of how bad the restaurant service and food were. considering there are a ton of great great places in vegas, i would highly advise anyone to pass on scarpetta.",

            "you know those few precious moments when you're absolutely falling in love with a dish? like your eyes roll back and you carefully savor each bite, wishing the experience will never end? it's an ecstasy that only a few restaurants can deliver. this describes my dinner experience at scarpetta, when i delicately pulled apart my fennel dusted spiced <mark>Black Cod</mark>. a bed of tomatoes and roasted fennel added a tangy zest to the fish. my lawd. this must be a dream. it's too good to be true!\n\nbam! snap back to reality. as i used my fork and knife to d<mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> piece of that tender cod to my mouth, i spotted a thin black line. hmm, that's an interesting lookin' spice. let me tug at it some more. lo and behold, it was a piece of hair, and it was definitely not mine. the hair was embedded in the cod's skin! i politely informed my waiter of the situation and he apologized, then asked if i would like to replace the cod with a different dish. i just wanted another cod. i wanted to return to that euphoria i was experiencing before my foodie world came crashing down on me when i discovered that unfortunate piece of keratin. \n\nlike forrest gump says, sh** happens. i understand that, but i'm at scarpetta. this is a high-caliber restaurant, one of the best in las vegas, owned by the famous chef scott conant. it's not something i would expect to happen here. my waiter was professional though, he quickly brought out another cod (since my partner was already done with his dish) and our dessert was on the house. i totally appreciate these gestures. yet, when my second cod arrived, it did not taste as heavenly as the initial one. i noticed that my second dish came out a lot faster than my first, which meant it was cooked in a shorter amount of time. the meat of my second cod looked a tad <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> it was almost rubbery in texture, not as moist and soft as my first one. there goes my foodie high. womp womp.\n\nthe kitchen staff probably invested less time and attention on my replacement dish. i know there was a slight rush to bring out my cod asap since my boyfriend already finished his entree. however, i was still paying for this dish and it was executed poorly compared to the first one. \n\nthis could have easily been a four or five star review. we asked for a table next to the window and the views of the strip and the bellagio fountains were stunning. so romantic and beautiful. my boyfriend and i started our dinner with the tuna \"susci\" with marinated vegetables and preserved truffles. this is essentially tuna wrapped around vegetables. it was almost like a sushi roll, but there was too much going on. we couldn't really tease out the tuna flavor.  \n\nmy boyfriend ordered the short rib & <mark>Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti</mark>. it's cooked in brown butter, horseradish, and toasted breadcrumbs. he said it was good but not amazingly tasty. he was still quite hungry after finishing his pasta. \n\nthe complimentary amedei <mark>Chocolate Cake</mark> with toasted almond gelato and salted caramel sauce was decadent. the chocolate was not overly sweet and the almond gelato was creamy.\n\nit wasn't purely the hair, but the fact that my second cod was unrecognizable compared to my first one. the rest of the items are pretty solid. the view is the best thing scarpetta has to offer. and maybe that <mark>Black Cod</mark>...when it is cooked properly.",

            "there are so many options to think about at the cosmopolitan when it comes to dining.  if you are thinking about a romantic dinner overlooking the bellagio fountains, this the restaurant to choose.\n\nadditionally when you go before christmas the hotels all tend to put their restaurants on a rotation since it is slow season.  scarpetta had been closed for 10 days until the night we went.  when i had made my reservations i mentioned it was my gal's birthday and would like a seat near the window.\n\nwe got there for our reservation and a table with 3 people showed up after us.  they were given a window seat.  we were given a table 3 rows away from the window and next to the waiter station.  we had a limited view of the bellagio fountains. the place is pretty dressy casual and there were a couple who had old jeans on sitting by the window.\n\nwe were limited on time as we were trying to catch a show at the bellagio.  the one thing to note is that our waiter was attentive to that point and never pushed us on dessert, but did apologize a couple times for the slowness of the kitchen during the meal.\n\nwe ordered our drinks as well as our meal in one fell swoop. as we were in a rush at the night was young, we ordered the <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> and <mark>Tuna susci</mark> with caviar for appetizers and  had the duck and <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark> and diver scallops with foie gras for main courses.  everything came out slow and we were rushed!  we had two drinks before appetizers finally came and i knew something was wrong and didnt want to ruin the evening.\n\nthey brought out the <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> but then a full tin of russian caviar with toast points...etc.  fortunately we love caviar.  unfortunately this was not going to be a simple $150 meal!!!  i did not want to and maybe should have said something but we had had a few drinks and i did nit want to ruin the special evening planned any more.  \n\nthe duck and <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark> was good but not as great as it sounds.  it was just too tempting to resist. i love duck and i love foie gras but i guess it didn't work well together for me.  the scallops were good too.  now that california has lifted its ban on foie gras i can now more easily pass when i see it on menus.  the <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> appetizer was just okay as well.\n\nnow the caviar was awesome but it is something i would rather have at a nice cocktail party and not on my own dime.  i am still wondering how that was put on my ticket because it was nowhere on any menus i saw.  my $19 dish turned into a $225 dish and my bill came to over $500 for two!  ugh!!!\n\nyes it was a special night, but very costly!",

            "i ate here last night and boyfriend and i decided on the tasting menu! it was about 6 different courses, each with amazing flavor. the bread basket and dippings that come with were so good i had to restrain myself from gobbling it all up too quickly. the cocktails were way better than expected too. i had the scarpetta cosmo since we were at the cosmo. :)\n\ni think our favorite course might have been the ravioli and spaghetti? no, wait, definitely the <mark>Creamy Polenta</mark>. get the polenta. and the starter of tuna and <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> was phenomenal. there was also cod served and <mark>Spiced Duck Breast</mark>, which were both perfectly cooked and seasoned, but i was getting so full at that point that i gave up midway through the duck. the ending dessert was a rich dark <mark>Chocolate Cake</mark> with gelato. they switched out the flavor of gelato for my boyfriend due to a nut allergy and were really accommodating. and they gave us some kind of pineapple cream in lava soup? that tasted like it came straight from hawaii and the man doesn't even like bits of fruit in his food but helped me eat all of this one.\n\neverything was perfect! we left more full than we expected off of a tasting menu! service was great and very informative.", 
            "came here for a romantic anniversary dinner after seeing great reviews by other <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> and we were definitely steered in the right direction. \nwe had made reservation a week in advance and were hoping to get a table with a view of the bellagio fountains, though they told us they can't promise and that we will have to try our luck when we arrive. we made it to our reservation on time, yet we still had to wait 20 minutes, which was alittle annoying considering we had made reservations. though we didn't get a fountain view, we were too hungry at that point to care. \nour server immediately bought out a bread basket with a trio of olive oil, eggplant and honey butter. the bread was incredible!!! my favorite was the salami and cheese filled one (i still dream about it). for appettizer we got the mediterraen octopus, which was cooked just perfectly! for our entrees we got prime filet <mark>Braised Short Ribs of Beef</mark> and ravioli foie gras and duck. though the ravioli was underwhelming, there was lot of ravioli squares which really was great. the filet <mark>Braised Short Ribs of Beef</mark>, on the other hand, was absolutely amazing. it was perfectly cooked and the softest beef i've ever had in my life. this really was the greatest dish i've ever eaten in my life and i was beyond impressed. \nfor dessert, we had mentioned that it was our anniversary and were given a <mark>Chocolate Cake</mark> with happy anniversary writing, which was a lovely surprise. sadly,. the cake was very dry but the ice-cream helped. \nin all i would highly recommend scarpetta and would love to come back here for our next vegas trip!!", 
            "i don't eat italian food too much so this was definitely a different experience.\n\nit was my brother-in-laws 30th birthday and we came with a party of 16.\nthe server was knowledgeable on the menu. recommended a few good dishes. since we were a party of 16, i understand we probably took a little longer to order as we were all deciding on what to order, but the server did not rush us at all. everything came out in a timely manner.\n\nthey had 3 different types of bread with three different spreads, butter, some eggplant tomato-y dip, and citrus herb olive oil (definitely the best one). just that alone was yummy. most of us skipped an appetizer as we weren't too hungry. one guest, however, did order their <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark>. the few bites i was able to sneak were tasty! it had a citrus flavor to it, and if you know me, then you know i drown everything in lemon.\nfor the entrees, i ordered their lobster pasta dish. it was very pleasant. with higher end restaurants, dishes tend to be more salty or over seasoned, which i cannot stand, but it wasn't at all. the pasta was thick and cooked perfectly. i was also able to taste the foie gras. i've never had it before and did not like that at all. the guest who ordered it, however, usually loves foie gras and didn't like it either. she said it tasted too bland. she wanted to speak to someone about it, but the waiter hardly checked on us. i also tried the short rib and bone marrow pasta dish. it was delicious. i loved the fried garlic to give it more of a crunch.\n\nfor dessert, most of us ordered their nutella dessert, which by the way, is superb! i grew up on nutella, and it brought me back to my childhood. it was pretty much sugar donuts filled with warm nutella with a side of banana ice cream. yummmmmy. another couple at the table shared their guava dessert. it was the perfect mixture of fruits, not too sweet either!\n\nnow for the bill splitting. we all individually calculated how much was going on each card, which was extremely time consuming and inconvenient that we had to do it ourselves, since he \"couldnt do it\".  the bill altogether wasn't too bad, and they didn't charge gratuity for that large of a party, but for this nice of a restaurant, i'd expect atleast a little happy birthday for my brother in law, but oh well. the food was worth the price. i recommend it, but i'd have to try other places before i decide on coming back.", 
            "<mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark>, your reviews hype it up again. the service was good, but the food, in my opinion is eh, okay.", 
            "i've been to scarpetta in beverly hills and enjoyed the food there so i was delighted to see another location at the cosmopolitan. i couldn't find any other review mentioning take out/to go orders and on <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark>, they're listed as not offering take out. the kids in our group really wanted pasta though so i thought i'd call to see if perhaps the information on <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> was incorrect. they do in fact accept take out orders. the lady who answered my call informed me that she could take my order over the phone or i could come in and order at the bar. \n\nordering was easy and i found the staff to be welcoming and knowledgeable. scarpetta is known for their spaghetti; however, the regular spaghetti sauce does have dairy and the noodles have egg. they removed the cheese and subbed in gluten free noodles to accommodate the kids' allergies. i myself had the duck and <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark>. all of our orders were delicious and definitely comprised of quality ingredients. it took about a 10 minute wait to make our order.\n\ni'm glad that they offer take out because they were the only restaurant in cosmopolitan that readily noted that they offered gluten free options. from my past experience with scarpetta, i know the restaurant itself isn't meant for kids. therefore i appreciate that we could still enjoy great food in our hotel room and avoid potentially disrupting fellow patrons' dining experiences. only caveat is that the serving sizes are on the smaller side - arguably not really a surprise for fine dining. the thirteen year old inhaled his serving of spaghetti and the two year old easily finished half of hers in one sitting.", 
            "sometimes one word is enough- perfection!\n\nwhile on another trip to the sin city;) my bf and i chose to celebrate our 3 years anniversary at this restaurant after many <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark>, looking for the perfect spot for this occasion .\nwe set at the bar area and arrived just in time for happy hour, which means we could enjoy multiple dishes and cocktails at a very reasonable price.\nwe orders almost the entire happy hour appetizer menu, as well as another main course from the regular menu, and were taken by every single dish.\nstarted with burrata crostini, <mark>Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti</mark> (which we later ordered again since it was so phenomenal), the sea food dish, <mark>Creamy Polenta</mark> and the tagliatelle\nfall vegetables, truffle zabagalione & guanciale.\nwe finished with the most amazing nutella mini donuts- to die for!!!\nour bar tender was ok, not very verbal, but it didn't matter since we enjoyed each other's company and the food was amazing!\nif you are in vegas, and looking for a delicious meal, don't skip this place!", 
            "in short; the food was five stars, the service was three stars. \n\ni can't say enough about the food! we loved it! unfortunately we had really bad service. we had two guys waiting on us. i don't know if the main waiter was busy or they were training, but it was obvious the second guy was more junior. he was trying to avoid saying, 'i don't know'. for example we asked what the parts were in the lamb three ways dish. we were told chops, short rib, and one other part that i can't remember right now. the chops made sense. when i commented that short rib was usually beef he agreed. so i said 'the lamb three way includes beef (which i don't eat)?'  he said yes. this sounded weird to us so we asked the first waiter and got a completely different answer. the dish included chops, shoulder, and a third type, maybe shank or something. ultimately we decided against the lamb so i can't tell you what was really in it. \n\nfor appetizers we got <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark>. there was three of us and i believe the portion came with five pieces. instead of giving us an extra piece to round it out, they gave us three pieces and kept two in the kitchen. that seemed odd so we questioned it. the junior waiter apologized and said the kitchen staff was new. who knows!!\n\nthe <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> was good and an additional serving came out of the kitchen. \n\nwe knew we had to try a pasta dish here as they are all handmade and scott conant does italian food so well. we had a few dietary restrictions at the table so we ordered the tagliatelle. we were told that it came with short rib, but it could be brought on the side since i didn't eat beef. the pasta arrived and it was delicious!!!! we were told the kitchen was figuring out the short rib for us. guess what? it never arrived! i wasn't surprised at this given how everything else was going. in fact i knew we were being duped the minute the waiter said it. the pasta was so good on its own so we didn't miss it or bring it up, but it was another problem with the service. \n\nfor entrees two of us got the halibut and it was amazing! my husband got one of the two beef dishes. the waiters disagreed on which one was liked best by patrons, but there weren't any problems with the dishes coming out incomplete. \n\nfor dessert we got the bomboloni. oooh they were divine!\n\nso again, food was top notch. there was not one thing that we did not like. i'm hoping service was only off the night we went. we weren't put off by it. we were actually laughing at everything that happened. it's a must try restaurant in my books.", 
            "before i went there i had read a few <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> reviews and i have to say that i expected something more. not that it's a bad place, just nothing to write home about.\n\nthe interior is very classy and elegant - dark wood, candles and comfortable white couches. the light is soft and dimmed, so it's a perfect spot for romantic, candlelit dinners. as in the majority of such sophisticated italian restaurants the menu is very short and well-considered. there is no banality there, the flavors are mixed in surprising, interesting ways - you can see that the chef wanted to do something different. they also have a lot of vegetarian and gluten free dishes, which is not so common. the waiter was very professional and knew exactly when the food should be served or taken from the table. he also recommended great drinks and desserts.\n\nthe bread they serve as a apetizer is fresh, soft and savoury - delicious. for a main course i decided to try <mark>Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti</mark> with brown butter, horseradish & toasted breadcrumbs. it tasted good, but was a bit on a small side and left me still hungry. my friends' portions were a bit bigger and they were satisfied with the flavors. the really good part were the desserts, we ordered mascarpone cheescake and banana souffle. they were perfect, not as heavy or as sweet as i though. the berry smash was also great! i had a few and i have to say there is waaaaaay more alcohol there than in poland, where i live. it's easy to get tipsy.\n\nso why only an \"ok\" grade? the prices are pretty high and the food is just ok. the concept itself may be interesting but the result is no so great as to overpay. there is probably a lot of italian restaurants which are just as good or maybe even better.", 
            "had dinner here by myself yesterday.  it's very elegant, i had a table with a view of the bellagio.  i had the spaghetti, they were delicious. the wine selection is top-notch and the dessert (st<mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> souffle) was great. service was also very good.", 
            "short rib marrow stuffed tiny ravioli's = ridiculously good.\nspaghetti with marinara and basil = amazing; perfectly al dente.\n\nst<mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> souffl\\u00e9 maybe one of the best deserts i've ever had.", 
            "one of the best meals of my life, with a spectacular view of the bellagio fountain show. we started out with cocktails & enjoyed the variety of complimentary bread served with citrus olive oil, eggplant caponata & mascarpone butter. we chose the lardo wrapped p<mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> as our appetizer which were served with rosemary lentils & it was very flavorful. i had the <mark>Black Tagliolini</mark> pasta for my entree which was lightly dressed with a cream sauce & topped with dungeness crab, uni & tobiko. i told the server's assistant who removed my empty dish that, had i been alone, i would have licked the plate...it was that good. i lived in italy for several months & had some great pasta, but never anything that spectacular. my date had the lamb trio which was filet, sausage & chop over ceci beans & baby carrots topped with hazelnut. he requested the chop cooked medium rare but it was served rare. the server quickly took it back for a re-fire & it was perfectly cooked upon its return. we enjoyed the nutella & vanilla bomboloni for dessert which was served with chocolate shortbread crumble & banana gelato. the only issue i had was that our server was a little aloof & cold, but it was late & i believe we were his last table so i understand. it really did nothing to detract from my fantastic experience at scarpetta & his assistant, guy with a beard & long hair (cute!), made up for it with his kind conversation. can't wait to return for another meal here!", 
            "perfectly romantic restaurant overlooking the bellagio fountains and strip if you're seated near the window as we were.\n\nmenu had great variety which made choosing pretty difficult. fortunately there was a fantastic bread basket with 3 types that kept us going.\n\ndrinks we got the gallardo and san remo. gallardo was a nice appletini-ish drink and the san remo was delicious.\n\nwe shared 3 dishes: the tuna+avocado and <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> to start. the tuna dish was more or less as expected with great quality fish and a nice garnish, also plentiful. the <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> came with 4 or 5 paper thin slices, also as expected served with a very subtle ginger/salt sauce. i was a little dissapointed with this given the quantity and quality.\n\nwe shared the branzino as an entree, which was incredible and served in a killer shellfish broth with small pieces of lobster, mussels, and potato. \n\nservice was definitely a little slow for our table (others were being served quicker) but we weren't in a rush so it wasn't a big deal. \n\noverall, 4/5 stars based on what we ordered for the price and the service, could easily be 5/5 based on other items so i'll return to try it out in the future."

            "as guest we felt like a burden instead of welcomed and we found the foods  we tried as one dimensional and under seasoned , flat and the dessert awful . maybe they just weren't in the working flow of things yet or maybe it just was an off night i don't know.\n\nthe door was wide open at 5:25 so we walked in and the hostess told us to make a reservation for 5:30 and to leave and come back in a few minutes . we thought that seemed odd but thought it was just because she was very young and figured that was all it was and came back a few minutes latter .\n\ntoo start with i received a white lint filled napkin on top of my black pants , but i did notice they have black linen napkins they use for the wine bottles. \n\nwe felt uncomfortable the whole time dining because most of the time i saw up to eleven members of staff were standing across from us with their backs against the wall just looking out into our direction . i glared at them a few times but they didn't budge .\n\nwe started with the <mark>Tuna susci</mark> -described as marinated vegetables with preserved truffles , everything was <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> everything had little taste.\n\nwe shared the <mark>Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti</mark> , that were like mini raviolis filled with short rib that had a baby food texture inside the well made pasta. maybe ten percent of the  agnolottis we topped with a scant amount of toasted  crumbs slightly laced with horseradish for flavor that were resting in some browned butter.\n\nthe <mark>Black Cod</mark> although cooked nicely would have been forgettable but was not , only because of the concentrated tomato that i found interesting .  this dish was extremely mild and under seasoned with a few pieces of fennel that were nicely caramelized .\n\nmy husband had the <mark>Spiced Duck Breast</mark> and he said it was his least favorite one he ever had since the skin wasn't crispy and also lacked flavor , he thought it wasn't seasoned at all .\n\nwe had a little time to kill before the show so we thought maybe dessert might be good . we ordered the zeppole i don't mean to be mean or disrespectful but honest to god they tasted just like the chocolate muffins of the sweet tomatoes salad bar buffet , the zeppole were bread like , not sweet , almost not chocolate flavored and only a few zeppole not all had essence of nutella in them . \n\nat this price range they don't have this much room for error.", 
            "a-ok is what scarpetta was. i was very excited to finally taste the famous pasta from the man himself-scott conant. i have been watching chopped for weeks and was curious what exactly does he think amazing pasta is. well scott maybe pasta is the only thing you should stick to.\n\nwe have ordered the hamachi, tuna, polenta, <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark>, <mark>Black Cod</mark> and the tasting menu.\n\nlet's start from the beginning. first of all i would like to say that the service was beyond reparable. we sat at the restaurant for almost 3 hours. it took the server to give us the menu for about half an hour and every time we looked for him he wasn't there. after hinting and hinting that we would like our food right away the longer it took to the point where we just left.\n\nhere is the breakdown:\n\nhamachi: nothing special-nobu beats this dish any day of the week.\n\n<mark>Tuna susci</mark>: if you think wrapping tuna over a bunch of carrots is creative-think again.\n\npolenta: i really enjoyed this dish. it came in a small pot with a mushroom sauce on the side. this was one of my favorite appetizers.\n\n<mark>Black Cod</mark>: it was a-ok. i wish it had more flavor and was more moist. i guess beggars can't be choosers. \n\nduck and <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark>: the dough was chewy and hard. the sauce on top ruined the whole dish in my opinion. the inside was tender and rich. i think if the ravioli were smaller and more tender it would come together better.\n\ntasting menu:\n\n<mark>Crispy Fritto Misto</mark>: a-ok. i like anchovies but i don't think this dish brought anything special to the table.\n\nspaghetti with tomato and basil was the best dish of the night! it was tender, flavorful and tasty. i would have this again any day!\n\ndessert: the <mark>Chocolate Cake</mark> was dry and even with the gelato on the side it still left a bitter rough flavor in my mouth!\n\nwe tried a few other things which i don't even care to discuss on the tasting menu\n\nthe bread basket was also pretty amazing! it came with 3 sauces which we ordered a second round of!\n\noverall i am not impressed by this italian restaurant. this has nothing to do with price or the atmosphere. i think as a food critic what you look at is the freshness of the food and the service. i have seen a lot of bad service but ignoring your patrons will not bring you very far.\n\nso scott conant i am giving you a c+. you have been chopped!", 
            "the final meal of our vegas escapade was well spent at scarpetta. it wasn't completely perfect but most of the night made up for the little missteps (we'll get to that later) so for the most part, i had nothing but a good time. attentive service, rich indulgent food, all housed within an intimate space with gorgeous views of the ballagio fountains, we closed our trip in pure hedonistic style.\n\nwe started with some of their signature cocktails as we browsed the menu. upon the recommendation from our fantastic server, and the joys of libation, we decided on the tasting menu ($99) and accompanying wine pairing ($49) since several of the dishes that we wanted to try were on it anyway and boy did we pick right. that was the beginning of six courses of pure pleasure.\n\nwe started with a sashimi plate (http://www.<mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark>.com/biz_photos/0nmtwqyeqikerdv4a55obg?select=yvhgcff5cqsiopyc83uwwa) which consisted of <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> with a drizzle of ginger oil and red onions. the other half of the plate sat the <mark>Tuna susci</mark> - tuna wrapped marinated vegetables. the fish was so fresh and the flavors were delicately balanced. the bread basket came shortly after and there was a nice selection including yummy foccacia and stromboli. as part of the tasting menu, the chef also threw in a couple of surprises and we were treated to a delightful seafood <mark>Crispy Fritto Misto</mark> for this course. perfectly crispy fried but not oily, every bite was yummy and the rock shrimp just melted in my mouth.  \n\nthe next course was a perfectly roasted sea scallop. (http://www.<mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark>.com/biz_photos/0nmtwqyeqikerdv4a55obg?select=06qyvnxbie8hftnykn4obw) it was a joy to eat and the velvety salmoriglio sauce was a nice accompaniment to the sweet and juicy scallop. the chef's extra this course was a polenta with a truffle mushroom stew. (http://www.<mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark>.com/biz_photos/0nmtwqyeqikerdv4a55obg?select=gtrwgpr4xgghmw0rvryanw) for the record i hate cornmeal and thus hate grits, tamales, and polenta. yet, i could not stop eating this polenta. the flavors of the mushroom stew combine with the impeccably smooth polenta. (i suspect there's a whole lot more butter in it than what chef scott conant lets on) it was a nice double headliner with the scallop. \n\nnext up was the pasta course and chef conant's signature tomato & basil spaghetti. (http://www.<mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark>.com/biz_photos/0nmtwqyeqikerdv4a55obg?select=jqrljq4g8bgizxs0bc8bow) fresh made pasta in a simple tomato basil (+ quarter stick of butter) sauce but just perfectly executed. while i thoroughly enjoyed it, the chef's extra this course, the <mark>Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti</mark> with brown butter horseradish & toasted breadcrumb (http://www.<mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark>.com/biz_photos/0nmtwqyeqikerdv4a55obg?select=wzfcolektvylois628h_ag), totally blew my mind. wow who would have thought that the combination of short ribs, horseradish, and toasted breadcrumbs could be so sublime? i miss it already as i speak. \n\nthe next course was the <mark>Black Cod</mark>. (http://www.<mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark>.com/biz_photos/0nmtwqyeqikerdv4a55obg?select=2tmoceavt5t4aeu8j6itra) again perfectly seared but wonderfully moist in the middle. the fatty fish absolutely stands out against the sauce and caramelized fennel. delicious. the next entree course was a the <mark>Spiced Duck Breast</mark>. (http://www.<mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark>.com/biz_photos/0nmtwqyeqikerdv4a55obg?select=br1frh72uravjtrhiq6w-a) while this was my least favorite dish of the night, it was still absolutely delicious which tells you the quality of the food all night. the orange and spices (i kept picking up 5 spice) worked well with gamy duck. all in all, a successful combination. \n\nfinal course and dessert was a <mark>Chocolate Cake</mark> with toasted almond gelato and caramel. (http://www.<mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark>.com/biz_photos/0nmtwqyeqikerdv4a55obg?select=udi5apzqgqwuqcgjvukosg) this is where i really had to throw in the towel after all that eating. the <mark>Chocolate Cake</mark> was really rich and decadent and i could only finish half of it but i just couldn't let the toasted almond gelato go to waste. it was just delicious. you can totally taste the toasted flavor. \n\nnow on to the kink of the night. since we were seated by the wine cellar, the sommelier came by several times to retrieve bottles of wine. each single time, he let the door hit me as i was eating without even acknowledging it, much less apologize. not that it was a deal breaker but you expect a little more basic courtesy especially when you're dropping good money on dinner. \n\nstill for a wonderfully decadent meal paired with friendly and attentive service, we had a good time and i strongly recommend scarpetta if you want to treat yourself to a fine meal on the strip.", 
            "while looking for a place to have dinner, i only needed to read 5 words to convince me to try this place out.  those five magical words were \"duck and fois <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark>.\"  umm...yes please!  so with little hesitation we called in for a reservation and i excitedly awaited dinner time.\n\nonce we arrived at scarpetta, we noticed that the decor was nice but not stuffy.  the people in the dining area seemed to be enjoying themselves and the view overlooking the bellagio fountain just added to the overall ambiance of the restaurant.  the ambiance and decor definitely work well to add to the dining experience at this restaurant.\n\nthe service was also another thing that was nice and attentive but not overly intrusive.  they were very quick to take our drink orders and were quick to come back once they noticed we were ready to order.  they also did a great job of explaining all the complimentary breads and butters as well as fielding any other question we had.  \n\nnow for the important part, the food.  here's a quick break down of what we had:\n\ncomplimentary bread:\n\nordinarily i wouldn't even mention this.  i mean, there are some restaurants that give you some phenomenally good bread but here is the thing that puts scarpetta above and beyond those other places.  the stromboli!  holy moly this thing is good.  bread baked around cheese and pepperoni (i think it was pepperoni) was just so good.  i honestly could have had this for dinner and i would've have been completely happy.\n\nappetizers:\n\n<mark>Tuna susci</mark> -   assorted marinated veggies and preserved truffles wrapped in tuna.  i suppose this was the chef's interpretation of a sushi roll but i have to say that it just fell flat.  i mean with truffle and tuna in the mix i am still scratching my head as to how this couldn't be good, but it just wasn't.  it was bland and under-seasoned.  my recommendation, don't get it.\n\nbeet salad - pretty much what you expect of a beet salad.  a great assortment of different beets with pumpkin seeds and stracciatella cheese with a balsamic dressing, it was refreshing and delicious.\n\n<mark>Braised Short Ribs of Beef</mark> - this was by far my favorite appetizer.  the short rib was succulent and delicious.  bedded on root veggies and risotto, this in a larger portion would make an amazing entree, let alone an outstanding appetizer.\n\nentree:\n\nindulge me for just a second while i d<mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> perverted metaphor.  if dinner were a porno, the bread was the nasty making out, the appetizers the foreplay, then the duck and fois <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark> would be the money shot.  goodness sakes alive this is one delicious pasta.  a nice big plate of perfectly cooked ravioli with a drizzle of marsala reduction; these decadent little bites were heaven in tiny little pockets of pasta.  if you like duck and fois gras, this is a must!\n\noverall, i had a great meal here.  i thought the prices were reasonable for vegas fine dining, the ambiance great, the service spot on, and the food was just phenomenal.  honestly, if i hadn't gotten the <mark>Tuna susci</mark> appetizer, this would have been just about the perfect meal, but even the susci couldn't dissuade me from giving scarpetta a well deserved 5 stars.  bravo!", 
            "if you want something more unique than docg then come here.\n\nhelpful staff, clean environment.  i was surprised that there was only one stall for this place.  they have an extensive wine menu.\n\ntheir bread and their dipping sauces for it were delicious. \n\n<mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> was delicious!\n\nalso ordered the\n<mark>Tuna susci</mark> not bad but i would have ordered another <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> tail instead of this\ntaglitelle \nspaghetti\nstracci \n\nif i could order one of those 3 pastas again i would pick the simple and very impressive spaghetti.  it's not just your ordinary tomato with basil spaghetti. \n\n\nthe guava sobert type of dessert was amazingly delicious!  a great surprise for the end.", 
            "simply put scarpetta is my favorite vegas restaurant. \ni've been a few times and each time i've left as satisfied as possible. \n\nfor an appetizer, i've had the squash soup, the <mark>Tuna susci</mark>, and braised short ribs. the squash soup is some of the best i've ever had. the tuna was good but i wouldn't get it again. the braised short ribs were perfect and while i have no idea what was in that sauce, it was heavenly. probably will get the braised short ribs the next few times i go.\n\nas for entrees, they are famous for their duck and <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark> and believe me, it lives up to the loftiest of expectations. it's such a unique dish and the duck and foie gras compliment each other perfectly. it doesn't feel too heavy, goes down sooooo smoothly and has this great sauce on top with just the perfect amount of cheese. ive had it multiple times and plan on getting it again in the future. \ni've also had the <mark>Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti</mark> which is almost as superb. the short rib is great and you get this really tasty hint of horseradish in the sauce. it's far from overwhelming, just a hint of it, but after a full plate of the agnolotti, you can certainly tell its there. but it doesn't take away from the dish, the short rib and pasta are both great.\nwhile i've not tried the <mark>Black Cod</mark> or the steak, my companions have and they have reported being very happy with their choices.\n\noddly enough, i've not had dessert at scarpetta. maybe in the future i will, i'm sure it will be tasty.\n\na few other things to note: the view is superb, definitely ask for a window seat and you'll get a side view of the bellagio fountains. it's just a matter of luck and if they have a table available, ask when you make the reservation. the portions are great. so often vegas portions (especially at nice restaurants) are so small, but these are adequate and leaves you filling full but not overly full (as often dishes are so heavy with fat and cream and such). the price is very appropriate. nothing is exorbitantly pricy, nothing is cheap, the price is correct.", 
            "after reading all of the great reviews, i am really excited to go to this restaurant.  we made a reservation because, online it said that they were recommended, but there were not many people in the place. we got the suggested appetizer of the <mark>Tuna susci</mark> and it was delicious! the waiter even had the kitchen split it onto two plates so my boyfriend and i could share.  it was delicious with white truffles in the middle and very well seasoned. my boyfriend ordered the black squid pasta with seafood because the reviews raved about it--it really wasn't that great.  it actually smelled and tasted a little overly fishy, but he was a good sport and ate it all.  i order the <mark>Spiced Duck Breast</mark>, and the duck was cooked perfectly.  the only suggestion i have is that the duck was cut very thick and there was not enough of the delicious orange glaze.  it was good, but not over the top amazing.  we were pretty full but ordered the st<mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> shortcake for dessert---omg amazing!  it definitely made up for the mediocre dinner. the service was really great, the dinner was blah, and the dessert was really good.  i would recommend this place, but i would not come here again.  there are too many other great restaurants in las vegas, this definitely has the atmosphere but i do not think our dinner was worth 150$.", 
            "was here this past year for ces, and we had 2 events here.\none was our company dinner in the private room with a view of bellagio fountains and the other was a upper management meeting with a client over wine tasting in the private seating area which is in the kitchen.\n\nfor the wine tasting, it was pretty awesome, except the room is probably equipped to seat 8 people comfortably, maybe 10, we squeezed in 12.  we enjoyed some awesome wines and some desserts, which hey mistakenly sent to our table, so they ended up comping those and bringing more, it was very good.  \n\nthe cool thing about this private room, is that you have to walk through the kitchen to get to it and it is located next to the kitchen, with glass floor to ceiling so you can see into the kitchen as they work and cook and the background is a view of the bellagio fountains and the strip.  \n\nthe second occasion was for our company dinner a few nights later since they were able to accommodate our group of 16 in the private dining room that is in front of the restaurant and our big boss loves italian food.  \n\nalthough you can order single entrees off the menu, we had our waiter set up our dinner family style with some of his recommendations and some of the things we wanted to try.  \n\nalso, our big boss had a request for something off the menu and the chef obliged with no problems.  keeping the boss happy is always key!\n\nwe had the following dishes.\napps - braised short rib <mark>Braised Short Ribs of Beef</mark>, <mark>Creamy Polenta</mark>, <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> and <mark>Tuna susci</mark>\nthe short ribs and the polenta were my favorite, the susci was just ok.\n\nentrees - duck and <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark>, <mark>Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti</mark>, sheep milk ricotta agnolotti.  all were awesome, but the duck and <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark> is very rich.\n\nwe had dessert, but i don't actually remember what i had.\n\nservice was great and except the bar was slow, so they comped certain drinks that didn't show up in a time fashion.\n\nthe minus one star was for the sommelier, who seemed to enjoy the sound of his own voice and didn't really consider the requests of the guests at the table.  i understand he is very knowledgeable and he is an expert, but he could dial back the ego and work with the guest.  \n\nother than that, great place, i recommend it and you will not be disappointed.", 
            "i really liked this place! my husband and i actually started off at d.o.c.g. and were sat in a booth up against the wall. we had no room and were too close to the next couple so i decided we should just go to scarpetta instead. the d\\u00e9cor is absolutely beautiful! we sat at a table by the window overlooking the bellagio fountains and it was stunning. so far happy with my decision. \n\nwe had the short ribs and the <mark>Tuna susci</mark> appetizer. the short ribs were good but nothing about them stood out as amazing. the risotto that came with them was just ok. the tuna appetizer was out of this world. the marinated veggies that came with were just so delicious and they went so well with the thinly sliced tuna. \n\nfor our entrees, my husband had the ny strip and i had the orata. the steak was seasoned perfectly and it was very good. the orata was somewhat different from what i expected. it is a very light dish so if you are watching your waistline, i would recommend it. the fish was cooked well and wasn't dry at all, just lacking some seasoning in my opinion. the tomato based broth was also a little bland but overall it was a good dish. we also ordered the glazed carrots to go along with our meal. omg, i couldn't stop eating these even after i was full. they were so good!! \n\noverall a great dining experience. i would like to go back and try some pasta next time. i also thought the service was excellent and the staff was very welcoming.",

            "there are so many options to think about at the cosmopolitan when it comes to dining.  if you are thinking about a romantic dinner overlooking the bellagio fountains, this the restaurant to choose.\n\nadditionally when you go before christmas the hotels all tend to put their restaurants on a rotation since it is slow season.  scarpetta had been closed for 10 days until the night we went.  when i had made my reservations i mentioned it was my gal's birthday and would like a seat near the window.\n\nwe got there for our reservation and a table with 3 people showed up after us.  they were given a window seat.  we were given a table 3 rows away from the window and next to the waiter station.  we had a limited view of the bellagio fountains. the place is pretty dressy casual and there were a couple who had old jeans on sitting by the window.\n\nwe were limited on time as we were trying to catch a show at the bellagio.  the one thing to note is that our waiter was attentive to that point and never pushed us on dessert, but did apologize a couple times for the slowness of the kitchen during the meal.\n\nwe ordered our drinks as well as our meal in one fell swoop. as we were in a rush at the night was young, we ordered the <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> and <mark>Tuna susci</mark> with caviar for appetizers and  had the duck and <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark> and diver scallops with foie gras for main courses.  everything came out slow and we were rushed!  we had two drinks before appetizers finally came and i knew something was wrong and didnt want to ruin the evening.\n\nthey brought out the <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> but then a full tin of russian caviar with toast points...etc.  fortunately we love caviar.  unfortunately this was not going to be a simple $150 meal!!!  i did not want to and maybe should have said something but we had had a few drinks and i did nit want to ruin the special evening planned any more.  \n\nthe duck and <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark> was good but not as great as it sounds.  it was just too tempting to resist. i love duck and i love foie gras but i guess it didn't work well together for me.  the scallops were good too.  now that california has lifted its ban on foie gras i can now more easily pass when i see it on menus.  the <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> appetizer was just okay as well.\n\nnow the caviar was awesome but it is something i would rather have at a nice cocktail party and not on my own dime.  i am still wondering how that was put on my ticket because it was nowhere on any menus i saw.  my $19 dish turned into a $225 dish and my bill came to over $500 for two!  ugh!!!\n\nyes it was a special night, but very costly!"

            "on the food alone, scarpetta is probably a four star restaurant. but with the spectacular space it occupies (cosmopolitan hotel, overlooking the bellagio fountains), it gets the five star nod from me. \n\nthe perfect ambience is hard to ignore. unbelievably swanky, scarpetta just oozes vegas. dimly lit, white linens, dark wood and interesting light fixtures mix to create a very upscale atmosphere. \n\nfood wise, i enjoyed two appetizers: the <mark>Chilled Pea Soup</mark> and sea scallops. the soup excelled where other dishes didn't in that the pea flavor wasn't showed up by the cream. for the other appetizer that made up my one 'entree', i found my scallops to be cooked near-perfectly, but one of them suffered from too much char, rather than a nice caramelization. there was also a too-gratuitous use of garnishes, from radish, to micro greens, to apples and more. less would've been more when the scallops are served with truffles white asparagus. \n\nthe dishes our friends had all received the same comment: heavy. while its summer and seeing the words 'summer truffles' on multiple dishes is never a bad thing, all those dishes all felt so heavy with butter and/or cream. \n\ni would be remiss if i didn't cap this review with a mention of the bread. served with dishes containing citrus-infused olive oil, cold eggplant spread and a mascarpone butter, the bread itself was out of this world good (though also heavy, as it's laced with a thin slice of salami and cheese). \n\ni can't say that my scarpetta experience didn't live up to the hype. however, like much of vegas, there was a sliver of feeling that the food itself didn't quite live up to the glitz and glamor of the restaurant itself.", 
            "my favorite thing about vegas is not the casinos, shows, or nightclubs (although the latter is a close second), but the abundance and quality of fine dining.  one of my girl friends requested that we dine at the cosmopolitan on our vegas getaway, so i picked scarpetta because it was spendy but not quite a splurge like \\u00e9 by jos\\u00e9 andr\\u00e9s or blue ribbon sushi bar & grill.\n\nas far as italian food goes, scarpetta was scrumptious, though overpriced like everything on the strip.  my girl friends and i were seated at a big, chic horseshoe booth--and if it weren't for our next destination (dancing at tryst and xs), i likely would've drank and ate more here. \n\nfor my appetizer i had the spring <mark>Chilled Pea Soup</mark> ($16) with gulf shrimp, guanciale (italian bacon), and reisling gelee.  it was the most delicious <mark>Chilled Pea Soup</mark> i've ever had in my life! incredibly balanced, fresh, flavorful, and masterfully presented.  \n\nfor my main i had the duck & <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark> ($26) with marsala reduction.  i absolutely wanted to love this dish due to the presence of foie gras, but i could barely taste the foie gras, let alone the duck.  i did appreciate, however, that the pasta was homemade.  crystal l.'s main course, the <mark>Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti</mark> ($25), with brown butter horseradish and toasted breadcrumb was a much better choice for pasta--i was so happy when she literally gave me half!  i knew then and there that this was going to be a wonderful night!\n\nif you like classic trattoria fare, i wouldn't go to scarpetta.  but if you don't mind fancy, modern italian, look no further.", 
            "let me start by saying that i've eaten at some pretty incredible places in vegas, spent a lot more money than i did here, but i absolutely enjoyed myself at scarpetta just as much at a fraction of the cost. everything was spot-on for our visit. despite having made last-minute reservations, we requested and received a booth where all four of us could see the fountains. the appetizers were amazing: we tried the <mark>Chilled Pea Soup</mark>, polenta, scallops, and short ribs. for entrees, two of us had the duck and <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark>, which i will be dreaming about for a long time; the <mark>Prime Aged Sirloin</mark>; and the spaghetti. one of us had dessert (yeah, that would be me), a <mark>Coconut Panna Cotta</mark> in a guava soup. perfect. my only complaint: the wine prices. they are, in a word, astronomical. i expect to pay double retail prices usually, maybe a bit more in vegas, but scarpetta is at least quadruple. so my husband chose beer, and i went with two glasses of wine and called it a day, rather than having to sell myself on the strip for a bottle.", 
            "fine dining at it's finest!\n\ncame here a saturday night during my last trip to vegas for a bachelorette party (apparently we weren't the only ones) and we were seated right in the middle on a long table which was nice for a party of 7 girls. our waiter and busers were on point and our waiter was really nice and always conversated with us and made our experience fab!\n\nlet's talk about that bread basket...how crazy is it that they actually have salami in one of the breads. they also have sourdough and herb focaccia  . they have butter, olive oil and this roasted tomato eggplant as a spread to go with the variety of bread they give. i liked the herb focaccia bread the best with the butter...it was toasted and soft in a small square (good for portion size). for my meal i got the <mark>Black Cod</mark> with tomato's and fennel because i love butterfish and i only eat seafood and i love vegetables...although i was debating on getting this or the halibut, i'm glad i went with this because it was so divine! i wish the portion was bigger but it's one of those restaurants where it's quality over quantity. we ordered 2 whites and 1 bottle of reds that night, and because my stomach was not having it, i only drank a glass of the 1st bottle. some of the girls ordered the lobster, scallop appetizers, split <mark>Chilled Pea Soup</mark>, foi <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark> and steak and everyone said everything they ordered was great. for desserts we got the hazelnut mini donuts, st<mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> cheesecake/shortcake in a cup dessert over a bed of crystallized sugar...i didn't get to try any of them but everything was all gone so it must've been delicious. \n\n\noverall the ambiance is beautiful, food is amazing/drinks and bread, awesome service and fine dining at it's finest. the portions are a little small and the price is a little pricey but worth it especially when it's a special occasion like a birthday, anniversary, valentines day, mothers day or bachelorette dinner =)", 
            "my girlfriends brought me here for my bachelorette dinner. our server titus was awesome and they had a pretty decent wine list.\n\nthe food fell a little flat for me. \n\nthe complimentary bread basket was phenomenal. my favorite was the focaccia with prosciutto.  bread came with three different spreads: whipped butter mascarpone, eggplant caponata and a lemon infused olive oil.  thy were all delicious but i especially enjoyed the eggplant caponata.\n\ni ordered the wagyu beef tartare as my appetizer. the beef wasn't as red as i would've liked it to be. it looked brown but i couldn't tell if it was from the bad lighting of the restaurant. the dish had no flavor and i basically had to force myself to eat it.\n\ni ordered the duck and <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark> with a marsala reduction for my entree. i like that they make their own fresh pasta but the dish lacked the debt of flavor you'd expect from the components of this dish. it was like waiting for a climax that never came.\n\nmy friend really enjoyed her <mark>Chilled Pea Soup</mark> but the other girls didn't really rave about their dishes. \n\nthe desserts (i forgot which ones we ordered) were great! we all definitely enjoyed that. \n\nthe restaurant's decor is okay. it's somewhere between modern and classic. the lighting is really bad... or good if you like it on the darker side. i like being able to see my food when i eat.", 
            "this was our fancy splurge celebration dinner while we were in vegas. i tried to make reservations for 10 online through their website, but i was told that there were no reservations available within 2.5 hours of our reservation time (830pm on a sunday) for 8 weeks. i called instead, and they were able to accommodate us. \n\nwhen we got there, we had to wait for a little while for them to get our table together, but the cocktail menu was beautiful. i indulged in the gallardo, hendrick's apple, lime, and basil. it was fresh and clean, really light and flavorful. it also came with a basil leaf floating in it, and was gorgeous. \n\nwhen they seated us, they'd given us a private dining room for our large group, and we had an amazing server who was knowledgeable, friendly, and willing to make suggestions. \n\nthe meal started with fresh baked rosemary bread served with a trip of condiments. there was soft, whipped marscapone butter, a rich eggplant tapenade, and simple quality olive oil. i order the spring <mark>Chilled Pea Soup</mark> with dungeness crab, almonds, and pea tendrils as a starter. it was so delicate, fresh, and really lovely. it tasted like spring. the crunch and nutty flavor from the almonds and the sweet meaty taste of the shredded crab was such a nice balance of the pea flavor. it was spring green, and melted in my mouth. i'm not even a huge fan of peas, but this is such a good example of how fresh, high-quality ingredients can elevate something simple to culinary art. \n\nfor dinner, i had the pici with lobster that the server suggested. this is the best pasta i've ever eaten. and i've eaten a lot of pasta. it's house made and fresh, and this is how al dente is supposed to be. it's firm and chewy, but still delicate and flavorful. it was made with tarragon, so it was green and herby. the pesto was made of almonds and chili, so it had a little spice to it. i could've handled more spice, though. there was almost no heat, but it's ok because the other flavors were so perfect. this is also the best cooked lobster i've ever had. i'm used to lobster in butter, or pieces so small thrown into dishes to give them an upscale feel, but these were beautiful, pink large pieces of lobster. they still benefited from the fat in the olive oil pesto, and it brought out lobster flavors i hadn't tasted before. they were tender and meaty, and balanced well with the pasta and pesto. it was simply one of the best pasta meals i've ever had in my life.\n\none of the house specialties is spaghetti with tomato and basil. sounds easy, right? once again, one of the best pasta dishes i've ever had in my life. the ingredients and technique are so high-quality that they elevate even the simplest meals into a once-in-a-lifetime experience. \n\nthe filet was tender and flavorful, although my companion felt is was little more medium-well than the medium he ordered. the potato puree it rested on absorbed the steak juices and every bite tasted luxurious. \n\nthe honey glazed carrots with toasted pistachios were roasted to perfection. they were soft, but not limp or mushy, and the pistachios added a pleasant nutty crunch. they were sweet, but not cloying, and well balanced. again, i'm not a huge carrot fan, but these made me a believer. \n\nmy one 21st-century complaint is the lights are so low, i wasn't able to get great pictures, but really, that's probably a plus. it was intimate and romantic. \n\nindulge at scarpetta and you won't regret it. take your time and savor the flavors at this masterful restaurant. there's a lot of work and knowledge going into these meals, and if you're privileged enough to eat here, relish every bite.", 
            "my husband took me here and i fell in love with the food and atmosphere. their <mark>Chilled Pea Soup</mark> is to die for. and they have a great sommelier. i love coming here and highly recommend it for any special night out or even just to try the food for all the foodies out there."

            "i must admit, my expectations were somewhat low for scarpetta, as i usually find the las vegas outposts of famous restaurants to be more about decor and overpriced menus, and less about food.  i was glad to be proven wrong.\n\nalthough scarpetta definitely delivers in the \"las vegas hip\" decor, with a gorgeous dining room that has a glass-enclosed wine cellar on one wall, and floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking the bellagio fountains on the other, it also delivers on the food front.\n\nat the waiters recommendation, my group of three decided to share a primi (app) and pasta, and order our own entrees.  before our first course came out, we were brought fresh bread basket which i can honestly say was the best bread i've ever had.  a mix of rosemary ciabatta, focaccia, and this to-die-for bread that had salami and mozzarella in it.  the accompaniments of olive oil, eggplant spread, and mascarpone butter were equally satisfying.  here is a by-dish review:\n\nheirloom tomato salad w/ stracciatella, salsa verde & marinated eggplant:  this dish was good, if not a bit common.  it seems so many restaurants have an heirloom tomtato & burrata dish, that if you've had one, you've had them all - although i was happy to learn that stracciatella is an equally awesome burrata-style cheese.\n\n<mark>Creamy Polenta</mark> w/ fricassee of truffled mushrooms: hands down the best polenta anyone at our table had ever had.  it was so creamy and rich, and went great with the mushrooms which were served from a separate pot.\n\nduck & <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark> w/ marsala reduction:  this dish was very well received by the two people in my party who'd never had foie gras.  i am a huge fan of foie, and found the dish to be lacking the richness that usually comes when it's served on it's own - but overall a great dish.\n\npancetta-wrapped <mark>Veal Loin</mark> w/ sweetbreads, peas & carrots: the <mark>Veal Loin</mark> was my favorite dish of the night.  i am used to having sweetbreads battered and fried, so it was interesting to have them in a more natural state - small chunks cooked and mixed in with the vegetables.\n\nzeppole w/ nutella center, vanilla sauce & candied hazelnuts: wow - we were blown away by how good this dessert was.  little chocolate donut holes filled with nutella - yum.\n\ni will say that their wine list leans towards the expensive side, with only a few bottles in the $60 - $70 range.  we ordered the castello di bossi chianti classcio riserva berardo, which was $105 (retails for $30) - a good wine, but a bit pricey.", 
            "my dining experience here was out of this world. the interior of the restaurant was absolutely beautiful, with modern & elegant tables & lighting.  we started off with the wagyu beef tartare and the <mark>Creamy Polenta</mark> with truffled mushrooms. the polenta was unbelievably creamy and luxurious!  then my friends and i ordered the tagliatelle, duck & <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark>, <mark>Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti</mark>, and colorado lamb loin done medium rare. everything was delicious, especially the lamb. the best part of the night was surprisingly the stromboli that was part of the bread basket at the beginning of the meal - buttery, fluffy slices of bread that was stuffed with salami & cheese. i am going back just for that bread!", 
            "we had great seating next to the windows viewing the bellagio fountains as requested.\nthe food was much better presented and tasteful than other italian restaurants i've visited in lv.\n\nthe bread basket is delightful with the trio of accompaniments: marscapone butter, eggplant in tomato ragu and citrus infused oil.  for appetizer we had the <mark>Creamy Polenta</mark>. enough for one or two to share as it is extremely rich as a separate duo of perfectly creamed polenta and truffled mushrooms. if you haven't already gobbled up your breads, make useful tool to sweep up the last juices.\nthree of us got the <mark>Black Cod</mark> which is superbly moist and light with a crisp skin, but the vegetables (fennel/peppers) were a bit too sour to match with.  and the other three got the <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark> which was rich and poignant with flavor but not unpleasant. the balsamic glaze was apparent and not overwhelming. i would have finished the entire plate.  \n\nwhy the three stars? lack of consistent service :(\ni don't include the guy who kept our water glasses filled. but we were all (party of 6) sourly disappointed with the main waiter. he only presented himself to take our order and serve the appetizer.  didn't even refilled our breads as asked.  then with empty plates, we all sat there for 15 minutes watching our server chummy up with a table of 3 girls and another table drinking it up with ample wine bottles. an assistant manager in a suit, bless him, came over, asked how our dinner was, saw our plates and decided to clear our table himself and also bring us our check.\nalthough we weren't completely dissatisfied with the whole dining experience, it's just unsettling when the server is mia with you and present elsewhere. \nso, maybe next time. if there is a next time.", 
            "what a memorable night it was! first, i definitely would request a window view of the bellagio water show if you can, because my boyfriend and i saw three shows while enjoying our dinner. scarpetta's very romantic but is also just a great place for a one-of-a-kind italian meal. \n\nwe started out with sharing a glass of pinot noir, which was delicious and smooth. for an appetizer, i highly recommend the <mark>Creamy Polenta</mark> with truffled mushrooms...then you must dip the bread they give you into the mushroom mixture. deliciouso! i ordered the simple, but unforgettable tomato and basil spaghetti and my boyfriend ordered the <mark>Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti</mark>, which he devoured. all their pasta is made fresh at the restaurant and can't be compared to any other pasta i've had. you must try it for yourself!\n\nreservations can be made online, and i definitely recommend this to anyone who is visiting las vegas with their significant other or wants to make a good first impression :)", 
            "great service, but the food was far below our expectations. \n\nthe bread basket was great, my personal favorite was the salami infused slices. as far as the meals go, my date ordered the the <mark>Creamy Polenta</mark> as her appetizer and she seemed to enjoy it. \n\ni opted for the <mark>Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti</mark> as my main dish and the pasta was loaded with <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> horseradish which flat out overpowered the whole dish with almost every bite. and i love spicy food, but it would took my breath away with almost every bite, so it was far too much for my liking. you would have to absolutely love horseradish to even enjoy this dish. \n\nmy date ordered the risotto with vegetables from the vegetarian menu which was just mixed diced vegetables. the dish came out at room temperature and did not taste good at all, so the order was sent back.\n\ni will not be returning to scarpetta, nor will i ever recommend it to anyone i know.", 
            "we had late reservations on a sunday, but it was still extremely crowded and even with reservations we had to wait 20 minutes. i was a little annoyed by having to wait, especially that late, but we ended up with a table that overlooked the bellagio fountain so that was nice.\n\nas everyone else has said, the portions are smaller than what people are used to but i actually liked that as my friend and i were able to split an app, and then each order an entree and split an additional entree as a middle course. the middle course was the spaghetti as we had heard good things, however we didn't find it to be anything special and it came out luke warm. however, we also had the <mark>Creamy Polenta</mark>, stracci, and black farfalle which were all amazing!", 
            "restaurant week 2011. the wife and i only planned on going out only once for restaurant week, but after perusing all the menus we were persuaded to try one more place -- scarpetta at the cosmopolitan. we were seated at a two-top by the window overlooking the bellagio fountains. one of the better views in town, it makes for a great spot for a romantic night out. the clean lines and modern motif of the restaurant interior add to the upscale and elegant atmosphere.\n\nscarpetta might have one of the best bread baskets around, but that can solely be attributed to the stromboli found within. warm, chewy and delicious, it's almost a meal itself. the focaccia isn't bad either.\n\nthe first two dishes were <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> and polenta. the <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> consisted of four slices of fish topped with olio di zenzero, pickled red onions and microgreens. a couple slices were bland and under seasoned, while others were perfect. the other app ordered came on the recommendation of our waiter. and, i'm glad i listened to him. the <mark>Creamy Polenta</mark> came in a decent sized bowl along with a pot with truffled mushrooms fricassee, which the server promptly spooned into the polenta. the rich and savory dish was unlike any polenta i've had before. \n\nthe <mark>Prime Aged Sirloin</mark> beef entree came sliced, cooked medium rare as ordered and was accompanied by a few light and fluffy potato gnocchi, wild mushrooms, barolo ragu, and topped with paper thin slices of parmigiano. the sirloin was good, but not nearly as good as the other entree.\n\nthe <mark>Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti</mark> didn't look like much when it was placed on the table -- a shallow bowl filled with a modest amount of small stuffed pasta. but, the flavor from each bite was amazing. each piece was a thin, delicate piece of pasta stuffed with tender short rib, with an intensely rich sauce. i loved the added texture that the bread crumbs added. it was a great dish on every level.\n\ndesserts were tasty, as well. amadei <mark>Chocolate Cake</mark> with toasted almond gelato and salted caramel sauce was dense and moist. the <mark>Coconut Panna Cotta</mark> with coconut sorbetto, guava soup and pineapple was surprisingly light, creamy, and not too filling. it was a beautiful presentation with the guava soup covering and contrasting the <mark>Coconut Panna Cotta</mark> below.\n\nour service was a perfect compliment to our meal. luis timed everything perfectly and provided the kind of personalized, friendly service that every top-notch restaurant should have.\n\ni've had plenty of underwhelming experiences over the years for restaurant week, but this was definitely one of the best. i'm already thinking about when i'll be able to come back and hopefully enjoy more great food and service.", 
            "for years, i've always felt that -- among the casinos -- the mgm grand has the best restaurants.  this may be changing, and scarpetta is *certainly* one of the biggest reasons why.  \n\nlynn and i followed up our \"good\" dinner wednesday night at comme \\u00c7a (also <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark>) with dinner at scarpetta the next night (followed friday night by los, but that's been written up way to many times).  \n\nbeing a celebrity chef is a double-edged sword . . . it certainly gets your name out there, but then you (typically) aren't there to defend it -- someone else is in the kitchen is, but if it sucks, you get the blame.  a potentially dicey proposition at best.\n\nscott conant need not worry; his vegas outpost is in excellent hands.\n\nthe six of us began with a bottle of n.v. champagne from chartogne-taillet (cuv\\u00e9e ste.-anne), and ordered a round of appetizers \"for the table.\"  (the table, too, apparently was hungry -- not just the six of us!)  \n\nfinishing the champagne just as the appetizers arrived, we moved into a 2008 bruno giacosa arneis.  we enjoyed the <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> crudo, the <mark>Creamy Polenta</mark> with a fricassee of truffled mushrooms (the winner of this round, imho), and the roasted sea scallops with porcini and sunchokes . . . all were delightful!\n\nvegetarian alert:  this place is *very* cool, and vegetarian-friendly.  they have a totally separate vegetarian and vegan menu available for the asking (as one in our party did).\n\nmoving into the pasta course, we had the spaghetti with tomato and basil (so simple to say, so profound to eat -- nothing can describe the layers of flavor that you get here; magnificent!), the duck & <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark> with marsala reduction (ok, this is to die for!), and the <mark>Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti</mark> with with brown butter horseradish.  of course, we also moved into a stunning piedmontese red, the 1999 barbaesco riserva vigneti in ovello from the  produttori del barbaresco.  just gorgeous!\n\nour entr\\u00e9es included <mark>Black Cod</mark> with caramelized fennel & concentrated tomato, sirloin with potato gnocchi, wild mushrooms, parmigiano & barolo ragu, a veal chop the size of baltimore (and much more tasty), and the aforementioned spaghetti with tomato and basil (as an entr\\u00e9e portion).  \n\na little dessert, a little porto and coffee, and the world is a perfect place!\n\np.s. in case you haven't figured it out yet, their wine list is not only incredible, but there are some true gems on this list that remain real bargains (if you know how/where to look).",

            "it's a fancy italian style restaurant at the cosmo. of course, the service is phenomenal and the food was pretty good as well. the bread was delicious, especially the one with the salami in it. all the fixings that come with the bread was really good too. \n\nwe got the <mark>Creamy Polenta</mark>, which was kind of like a mashed corn (i think), but it kinda had a mashed potato texture. the truffle mushrooms made it really delicious. we also got the <mark>Veal Loin</mark>, which was really good. it was tender and not at all gamey tasting. it was very well seasoned and tasted delicious, especially since it was my first time having veal. i got the stracci, which was pasta with lobster, crab, and shrimp on top. if you're a seafood lover, then you'll love this.", 
            "the bread basket alone would bring me back! that stromboli is amazing! i love salami and bread, so put the two together.....fuggetaboutit!\n\nwe had the tasting menu: \n\n- duo of <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> and tuna \"susci\": melt in your mouth delicious!\n\n- roasted sea scallops, cauliflower, bottarga, chili and caper salmoriglio: sea scallops can be rubbery and chewy if not cooked properly, but at scarpetta, they were cooked to perfection. they had the consistency of flaky, firm fish and the roasted cauliflower was a perfect pairing.\n\n- spagetti tomato basil - simple and good, but not memorable.\n\n- <mark>Black Cod</mark>, caramelized fennel & concentrated tomatoes - the fish was nice and flakey and the tomatoes added a nice acidity to the fish. i'm not a fan of fennel as they are too \"licorice-y\" in flavor for my taste.\n\n- <mark>Spiced Duck Breast</mark>, endive, preserved orange and cippollini - delicious! i love duck, but i hate when its not cooked properly or tastes overly fatty. this was a perfect balance. the preserved orange cut through the richness of the duck. yum!\n\n- amedei <mark>Chocolate Cake</mark> & toasted almond gelato - toasted almond gelato & salted caramel sauce. self explanatory....it was heaven!\n\nwhat made this experience special was that the chef brought out a few mini appetizers with every dish served, so it was like having an \"extended\" tasting menu. he brought out:\n\n- <mark>Crispy Fritto Misto</mark> - seafood, vegetables, artichokes, herbs & lemon\n- <mark>Creamy Polenta</mark> - fricassee of truffled mushrooms: by far my favorite dish at scarpetta. upon first glance, it looks like it would be too heavy and rich, but it was amazing!\n- <mark>Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti</mark> - brown butter horseradish & toasted breadcrumb.\n- zeppole - nutella center, vanilla sauce and candied hazelnuts. need i say more?\n\ni loved the ambiance and service of this restaurant. we were seated by the window facing the fountains of bellagio. a beautiful place to take someone on a date!",

            "when it came time to celebrate my 32nd birthday, scarpetta, it was. i made 5:30 reservations on opentable.\n\nwe were the first diners of the evening, we were seated at a table for two overlooking the bellagio fountains. however, when the fountain show actually began the we realized the view was quite obstructed from the tall trees surrounding the lake. it was no bother, we didn't come for the view, we were there for the food. \n \nwe started with a delicious bread basket, it had a variety of italian breads and the real treat was stromboli with prosciutto and smoked mozzarella. citrus olive oil, butter with marscapone and eggplant & tomatoes accompanied the bread. i could've easily made a meal from this, but i ordered the <mark>Creamy Polenta</mark> to whet our appetite.\n\ni've heard nothing but praises for this polenta. it was a beautiful dish. luscious and full of truffle flavor, but it didn't leave me wanting more. \n\nnext, we opted to skip the entrees and order selections from the secondini portion of the meal. frank went with the signature spaghetti. it's been featured on \"the best thing i ever ate\" so it's hard to pass it up. i went with the duck and <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark>. it was the dish that made me lust over the restaurant for the past year. \n\nthe ravioli did not disappoint. it was the second best ravioli i've had to date. mama egi's ravioli over at circo takes the cake. but this was very, very good. well balanced and the raviolis seemed to melt on your tongue. the spaghetti was good, but hardly a best thing i ever ate. i enjoyed the simplicity of it, the al dente noodle, but $26 spaghetti should knock my socks off, it did not. \n\nwe weren't overly stuffed so we took a gander at the dessert menu and quickly chose zeppole for dessert.\n\nnow, this was special! i'm not fond of dessert oozing with sweetness. this bordered on savory and i love it. these little pillowy bites were filled with nutella and topped with candied hazelnuts. there was a creme anglaise for dipping. it was a perfect end to the meal. \n\nservice was very good throughout. our server, luis, was helpful and he made certain we did not go thirsty. fresh iced teas were plentiful. the meal set us back $92. pretty good considering one could easily spend an arm and leg here.", 
            "this place is wonderful!! great service, ambiance and delicious food.\n\ni was originally a bit turned off by the poor service of the hostess taking our reservation over the phone, but once we arrived the staff (especially our waiter, mike) was very friendly and accommodating. we loved the ambiance: dim lighting, candles on the tables and stylish decor. we requested a table with a view of the bellagio fountains. it was really nice being able to look out from time to time even though there's a big bar on the window right at eye-level that makes it difficult to watch the fountain show without needing it lean over awkwardly.\n\nfood: overall, we really enjoyed our meal! though there were a couple items i'd recommend against, we loved most of the dishes we tried. here's a quick review of each item we ordered:\n\nappetizers\n\n- beet salad: i enjoyed this, but it was my least favorite of the apps we ordered and could have used more beets.\n\n- roasted sea scallops: if you like seafood, this dish is a must! so good. it was my favorite item we ordered, and my mouth is watering just thinking about it.\n\n- <mark>Creamy Polenta</mark>: another amazing dish! creamy, buttery perfection.\n\nentrees\n\n- spaghetti: my boyfriend loved this! he said it was the best spaghetti he's had here in the states. the noodles and sauce reminded him of spaghetti in venice, italy. :-)\n\n- mediterranean branzino: i was disappointed in this dish. the fish was bland and the overall flavor was nothing special.\n\ndesserts\n\n- amedei <mark>Chocolate Cake</mark>: loved this!! the only thing that would have made it better is more gelato. it only comes with a tiny scoop and goes quickly with how chocolaty the cake is. simple solution: request extra gelato while ordering.\n\n- zeppole (with nutella center and vanilla sauce): we debated over getting this and splitting the two different desserts or just getting two <mark>Chocolate Cake</mark> (which we knew we'd love). i'm so glad decided to give it a try as it ended up being our favorite!! i'd definitely recommend it to others dining here.", 
            "prime location, delicious food, and great service...our meal at scarpetta was definitely one of the highlights of our vegas trip. there were a few missteps on our food adventure, but not nearly discouraging enough to detract from the overall experience. \n\nwe made reservations for 6:30 on thursday night, which seemed to be the latest time to arrive and get one of the tables overlooking the bellagio fountains. we got the last one available. the only issue with the view is that there is a giant metal bar running exactly eye level across the window, so you have to pop your head up like a little meercat just to get a glimpse of the fountains. oh well.\n\nwe ordered the tasting menu and told the waiter that we'd like a bottle of white wine, somewhere in the semi-sweet to semi dry range, full-to-medium bodied, in the $50-60 range. the waiter brought us two options to taste, and we went with a delicious riesling. the bread course came with a lovely tray of marscapone cheese whipped butter, lemon infused olive oil, and a delicious fresh tomato spread. we didn't eat too much, because we knew we had seven courses of awesome heading our way:\n\n1) the first course was <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> and tuna sushi. the <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> was served with thin pink rock salt wafers that complemented the fish perfectly. the tuna was rolled around marinated vegetables and served with preserved mushrooms. everything was light, fresh, and flavorful. an excellent way to start a meal. a <mark>Crispy Fritto Misto</mark> came on the side - the tempura fried herbs and lemon were a delicious addition to the standard tempura fare - shrimp...veggies...etc.\n\n2) the second course was a sea scallop served on top of cauliflower, with a cauliflower puree, chili oil, and a salad with capers on top. - the capers were a bit salty for my liking, so i pulled them off, and the cauliflower with the cauliflower puree was a little redundant, but oh. my. goodness. that scallop was the best i've ever had. the crust was perfectly carmelized, and the scallop inside was tender and melted in your mouth. the small trace of heat from the chili oil added an unexpected twist to the dish and really took it to another level. \n\n3) the chef added in course number three - <mark>Creamy Polenta</mark> with truffled mushrooms. my biggest complaint here is that i can never eat anyone else's polenta again. amazing doesn't even begin to describe it. my friend and i dove into this lake of creamy, buttery, savory goodness with reckless abandon, knowing full well that we were completely spoiling our appetite for the four remaining courses. if nobody had been watching, i would have licked the bowl. we took a little break before moving on in the meal.\n\n4) the pasta course was both a super high and super low note in the meal. after seeing scott conant revered as the king of spaghetti on television time after time, we finally got to see what all the fuss was about. the simple spaghetti dish was amazing. i have never had pasta so perfectly al dente. there was a bite to it that other pastas lack, almost to the point where you feel like it will stick in your teeth, but it doesn't. it was served with a fresh tomato basil sauce that was so perfect, it didn't need any fancy infused oils or architechtural garnishes. it was just pasta perfection. \nhowever, the short ribs angnolotti with brown butter horseradish sauce was just awful. the horseradish sauce blew away every other flavor on the plate, and it wound up tasting like a big plate of mustard. this is the awkward thing about not liking a dish in a tasting course - we were only halfway through the meal and we'd had such good courses previously, that we felt a little awkward sending it back...so we just moved forward with the meal.\n\n5) the next course was a <mark>Black Cod</mark> with concentrated tomato sauce and carmelized fennel. perfect crispy skin, rich, flavorful sauce, and crunchy fresh veggies - definitely a hit.\n\n6) <mark>Spiced Duck Breast</mark> with endive, cippolini onions, and a preserved orange - this dish was ingenious. the duck, endive, and onion were perfectly cooked, but it was the addition of the super thin slice of sweet preserved orange that really made the dish. \n\n7) dessert - simply outstanding - a chocolate lava cake on a streak of carmel sauce with toasted almond gelato on a bed of chocolate cookie crumbs, with a delicate twirl of chocolate as a garnish. \n\nthe only problem with this meal is that it was so delicious, there was no way you could leave anything on your plate. my friend and i polished off every dish - which left us feeling so full that we barely made it out of the restaurant.\n\nif you decide to attempt this delicious seven course food adventure - open your wallets wide - food, drinks, and tip set us back $350...but it was well worth it.", 
            "this place is amazing.\n\nlocation isn't a huge factor to me.  as a local in las vegas, i avoid the strip when at all possible.  that being said, being sat at a window overlooking the bellagio fountain show is a nice view to see (no matter how many times you have seen it.)\n\nthe server (joe) was nice, funny, and informative.  he knew how to sell without selling.\n\nfirst off, bread.  with a place called scarpetta, you should expect great bread... which they have.  one of them has salami in it, and i was happy just eating that.  the bread came with olive oil, a tomato chutney-like sauce, and a pesto.  all were great, but the olive oil blew me away.  i enjoyed it so much, i bought a bottle.\n\nappetizers, i got the \"<mark>Creamy Polenta</mark>\" which turned out to be the creamiest polenta i have ever had.  it was served with mushrooms and was amazing.  my date had the roasted sea scallops.  the service size was a tad on the small size, but she seemed to enjoy it nonetheless.\n\nonto the entrees.  i'm a food network addict, and saw scarpetta while ago on \"best thing i ever ate\" where they talked about the spagetti with tomatoes and basil.  i had it, and it was good.  it wasn't the best pasta dish i have ever had, but a solid 8/10.  the pasta is fresh, and had a great texture to it.  the sauce was heavy on the basil (a good thing,) and there wasn't a ton of it weighing down the dish.  next time i go, i'll try something different.\n\nmy date had the duck and foie gras ravoli.  she seemed to be very much enjoying it, and let me have a bite.  i then understood why scott conant is looked at as this great master of italian cooking.  this dish was outstanding.  i might just get this next time i go.\n\nlastly came dessert.  i was informed there was no tiramisu on the menu (my favorite italian desert,) so we looked at the menu.  our server recommended the <mark>Coconut Panna Cotta</mark>.  my date got that, and i got the crispy sweet risotto crepes.\n\nthe only downside to the meal, i would have to say is the risotto crepes.  it isn't that they were bad, it is just that they were more like taquitos than crepes.  they were little rolled and fried pieces of batter with a sweet risotto in the middle of them.  for the amazing meal we had up to that point, it was a letdown.\n\nmy date's <mark>Coconut Panna Cotta</mark>, however, was fantastic.  it had that light and fresh taste that you want after eating a lot of pasta.\n\ni will definitely be going back, i'll just get the ravioli and <mark>Coconut Panna Cotta</mark> instead.", 
            "scarpetta knows how to make a girl happy.  i went there this past sunday for my very good friend's birthday dinner. she said she had the spaghetti a year ago in miami and has been dreaming about it ever since.  now i know why!\nbefore i get too far ahead of myself though, let me start at the beginning of my experience. my group was pretty large and scattered throughout the strip. a few of us were fashionably late but the hostess had no problem seating those of us who were there on time. that's uncommon for shi-shi- type places and i really appreciated it. the decor was a dark/ modern/ rustic all-at-the-same time- type of feel. very sexy place :o) plus it overlooks the bellagio fountains and the strip! nothing like enjoying a killer meal with that type of view. \nthe sommelier was a delight. he helped us pick out a wine that had the qualities we wanted without breaking the bank. we thought it was hilarious when he said \"how about this vintage\" while pointing right at the price. very classy way to help price-concerned consumers w/o announcing to the entire room that we were trying to save money.\na bread basket is usually of no consequence but, here, it was sooooo good! one roll in particular had prosciutto or salami wrapped in and it was amazing! fresh, warm, and perfect!\nwe shared a bunch of starters.  i got the <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> fully intending to share but that did not happen. it was so fresh and delicious with the shredded red onion on top that it somehow disappeared before i could send my plate around the table... oops!  i also managed to get a bite for my friend's <mark>Creamy Polenta</mark>. to. die. for. says it all.\nnext, our main course  - the spaghetti. let me preface this by saying that 6 out the 7 people in our party ordered it because my friend hyped it up so much. we were not disappointed. i normally try to stay away from carbs and i seriously cannot remember the last time i went out and actually ordered spaghetti! it was just so good! it wasn't a heavy, flowery mess of wet spaghetti strands. it was light, tasty, cooked, and sauced to perfection. ps. it was great on its own - no meatballs or anything necessary to dress it up. that is a plate i would certainly order again. \nin sum, i had a great experience. i paid ~ $100 for bread, pasta, some sashimi, and 3 glasses of wine and i still can say that it was well worth the price.  i would go back and definitely recommend scarpetta - vegas to friends!  :o)", 
            "after reading all the reviews here, i decided to try the fantastic pasta place that <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> are craving about.  the restaurant is located on the third floor at cosmopolitan hotel and it is an easy find once you reach there.  it's a nice high end restaurant and you can pick the window seat so you get to overlook the bellagio fountain.\n\nwe are a huge party so i get to try couple different appetizers and main dish.  i have to say, it is a total disappointment.  not to bash on their food because the food actually  taste from ok to good, but the food does not taste like the level when you are spending 50 dollars a person.  it lacks that \"wow\" factor.  \n\nto further breakdown the night, there are two things that wowed me.  first, is their salami bread, it is really tasty and you rarely see it from any other restaurant. second, is their <mark>Creamy Polenta</mark>, you need to eat it while its hot and it is delicious.\n\nhowever, all the other dishes are mediocre at best.  i ordered the duck and <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark>, and it is so salty.  i love salty food and always add extra pepper and salt on my french fries, and even i have a hard time taking on the saltiness of its duck and <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark>.  also, their tomato & basil spaghetti is very plain.  taste good if it is $15, but not at $24.  \n\none worst part is their restroom.  they have 1 female and 1 male restroom, and you can only use it one person at a time.  so, during the night, people kept waiting in line for restroom.  i understand the fact that you can exit the restaurant and there is another cosmopolitan restroom outside, but isn't it a little absurd when you have only one bathroom stall in the restaurant.  \n\noverall, it is not my best vegas restaurant experience, i would rate it somewhere between 2.5 stars to 3 stars.", 
            "after much research on where to dine for our five year wedding anniversary, my husband and i decided on scarpetta. the menu looked delicious and the prices weren't outrageous. we called about three weeks in advance to make our reservation for seven people. i was surprised that they only had one time left but was very happy we were able to get in at 7:30pm. we were all super excited to dine there. i tweeted about it and they even tweeted back at me, which i thought was a nice touch. \n\nwe arrived a few minutes early for our reservation and only had to wait about five minutes for a table. we were hoping for a table by the window but didn't get one. we were near the wine wall but could still see the bellagio fountains. \n\ni'll break this review into two parts.\n\nservice:\ni'd never been to a higher end restaurant like this before, so i was expecting exceptional service like i had never previously received. while the service was very good, it didn't live up to my expectations. our waiter was a really nice guy, but i think he might have been newer because he seemed a little bit awkward and shy. also, i asked him to take a picture of our whole group and he forgot. then two people had to leave so when he finally did take the pic, not everyone was there. there was another man (paul?) who was in charge of the wine and he was another story. he was so suave and charming. i wish he could have been our waiter! there was a major glitch in our evening considering the type of place we were at. we receieved our bill, and as we were looking over it we realized they put two $125 bottles of wine on it rather than just the one. i'm glad we noticed, because that's a fairly big mistake to make. service in general was on the slower side. there were many gaps where nobody came to our table. we were there for about two hours. the guy refilling the water glasses was really nice, though.\n\nfood:\nbetween the seven of us, we ordered:\n-<mark>Crispy Fritto Misto</mark> (x2)\n-heirloom tomato salad\n-<mark>Creamy Polenta</mark>\n-tagliatelle (x2) (this is what i ordered)\n-duck and <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark>\n-spaghetti\n-pea tortelli\n-i know i'm missing one, but i can't remember/obviously didn't try a bite.\n\ni had bites of everything and it was all delicious. of course, the bread starter was fantastic. the polenta was great and rich. the ravioli was so rich, i wouldn't have been able to eat it as my main dish. it was also incredibly salty. it might be nice in a smaller size as a starter. the vegetables in my tagliatelle were super fresh - such a difference fresh veggies make! the spaghetti was very good, fresh and delicious, but it didn't knock my socks off like it has for some other people. of all of the pastas i tried, i would order the pea tortelli next time. the portion sizes are not large, but just a nice amount to leave you satisfied and not bursting. \n\nthe atmosphere of the restaurant was nice. not as intimate as i wanted, but i think we would have had to spend more somewhere else for that. i was sort of surprised that there were a lot of skimpily dressed stagettes and dudes in t-shirts and baseball hats! \n\nwe had a very good experience here but it just fell a bit short of my expectations based on the many other reviews i read.", 
            "our party of 4 came to celebrate a friend's bday based on a recommendation. all reviewers who had previously mentioned about the great view of the bellagio fountain is correct. though, you'd get a much better view if you were a party of 2 seated right by the window, of course! \n\nservice was great! our server gave great recommendations and the other wait staff were fantastic! they kept bringing basket after delicious basket of bread with that citrus-infused olive oil and refilled our drinks constantly!\n\nwe ordered the <mark>Creamy Polenta</mark> with truffled mushrooms to share, duck and <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark>, pan-seared escolar with sun chokes, american wagyu rib cap and a lobster pasta  that was the daily special. the polenta was amazing!! we shared it but i was ready to order another for myself. the polenta itself was so fine that it added to its creaminess and then topped with the truffled mushroom sauce added to its heavenliness! all our entrees were delicious (as evidenced by the fact that nothing was left behind), except the  lobster pasta. while i enjoyed the fresh and sweet lobster and love the freshly made chewiness of the pasta (think udon in terms of thickness), the combination together with the sauce was not incredibly tasty. it almost resembled a lobster bisque type sauce and i think it made the dish too \"seafood-y.\" hands down our table's favorite was the american wagyu rib cap - wow!!! the meat itself was incredibly tender and so divine that it just melted in your mouth. even without the sauce reduction that accompanied it, the beef was naturally flavorful and worth its price tag. you don't get much but, you definitely get a phenomenal piece of meat! as for the ravioli, like others have mentioned, it was a bit on the salty side and even before our order, i mentioned it to our server and he gladly told us that the dish can be altered to fit our tastes. the escolar, not on the menu, was perfectly cooked and just as juicy and flaky as fish should be - delicious! \n\noverall, the order came out to be a bit over $200 with 2 iced teas, 1 appetizer and 4 entrees. it was well worth the deliciousness that filled our bellies, the unique experience of being in such a gorgeous atmosphere and great service! i would visit again in a heart beat and save my $$$ for the next special occasion.", 
            "came here for a special occasion after nora's wine bar closed.  we needed something that would wow us.  the ambiance certainly did, the service was great, and the food certainly did at times.\n\nwe did the tasting menu.  and the bottom line is that we were very happy, but not as happy as we could possibly be.  the expectation was high, and so was the price...so at the price we really needed it to come through for a 5 star rating...it ended as a 4 or 4.5 star experience for us.\n\nthere were a few items that left us wanting.  the spaghetti was good, but not the best thing i ever ate good (pasta or tomato... either way it was just above average good.)    the spaghetti was simple and lacked anything to set it off as truly amazing--coming off above-average, but slightly flat.  likewise we enjoyed the duck & <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark>, but not at the raved about level we hoped for. the raviolis were overly rich and lacking balance...we were vary happy to just have a small portion in the tasting menu.\n\nsome of our favorites were <mark>Black Cod</mark>, branzino, <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark>, and <mark>Creamy Polenta</mark> with fricassee of truffled mushrooms.\n\nwe were also happy with the bread basket...how can you not be though?...a bread basket that includes a stromboli of rolled with cheeses and salami...yes please!\n\nwe had an amazing seat overlooking the bellagio fountains.",

            "my girlfriend and i spent our thanksgiving holiday in vegas with our respective families.  the original plan for thanksgiving dinner was to go to caesars' bacchanal buffet, but since we were staying at the cosmopolitan, the logistics of getting the family together there scrapped that plan a.  plan b was to go to the cosmo's wicked spoon buffet, but the three-hour plus wait resulted in us scrapping that one, too.  as a result, we made our way to scarpetta since everyone likes italian (right?) and they could accommodate our party of eight without reservations at 6:30 pm on thanksgiving day for dinner.  by this point, we were just happy that we found someplace...anyplace...for dinner.  \n\nwe were seated in a nice, small, private room looking out over the bellagio's fountains to the north.  matthew, our server, was exceedingly professional and knowledgeable about the menu, offering spot on food and drink recommendations.  we started off with drinks while we looked over the menu.  i had the billionaire ($16) made with elijah craig, pomegranate syrup, pernod absinthe, and lemon juice.  frankly, the cocktail was well made and pleasing, however, for the price, i wasn't impressed with the choice of elijah craig as the base spirit unless it was for their 18 or 20 year old stuff.  of course, since they didn't specify, i assumed it was for the standard 12 year old bourbon.  for starters, the table shared an order of <mark>Crispy Fritto Misto</mark> consisting of seafood, vegetables, artichokes, herbs & lemon ($18) and an order of <mark>Creamy Polenta</mark> topped with a fricassee of truffled mushrooms ($17).  all elements of the <mark>Crispy Fritto Misto</mark> were fried to perfection, crispy, without a hint of sogginess, leaving the mix of shrimp, calamari and octopus tender.  i like polenta.  the polenta was creamy as advertised and as good a polenta as i've ever had.  that said, it was $17 for polenta...a bit pricey.  chef scott conant and his scarpetta are known for its fresh made pastas, so for my main course, i had the pici, a thick, spaghetti-like pasta, with lobster, preserved tangerine & bottarga ($36). http://www.<mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark>.com/biz_photos/scarpetta-las-vegas?select=emj-zvy2ihq8gwdluu6ipq#qpdstngpczl7isr5mb4p5g  i'd never had pici before and it was a hearty, filling pasta.  it was tossed with restraint with what i'm assuming was only olive oil, the preserved tangerine, bottarga (a dried, pressed fish roe), and tender chunks of lobster claw meat.  the pasta dish was outstanding as the flavor profile and aromatics of each ingredient were present and in perfect balance.  while it was one seriously pricey bowl of pasta, it tasted like it was worth every bite as it hit my tongue.  the gf and i split a side of roasted mushrooms consisting of trumpet royale, beech, and shitake mushrooms, topped with pecorino and trucioleto vinegar ($11) http://www.<mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark>.com/biz_photos/scarpetta-las-vegas?select=emj-zvy2ihq8gwdluu6ipq#emj-zvy2ihq8gwdluu6ipq  it was a nice plate of fungus and excellent complement to my pasta. \n\nscarpetta may not have been our first choice for thanksgiving dinner, but it was definitely a good choice.  the food was well-executed and delivered amazing flavor.  service was attentive without any hint of intrusiveness.  the only downside was that it was quite expensive and some items seemed overpriced for what was received.  still, scarpetta is a fine restaurant and perfect for a special occasion...even thanksgiving dinner.",

            "my friend had tried the scarpetta in la and had raved about it, so when she came to town we had to try the one at the cosmopolitan hotel. she was absolutely right (she usually is ;) and i have been back several times since first trying it with her. \n\nthe restaurant is beautifully done .. very contemporary and chic .. and most every seat boasts a fabulous view of the bellagio fountain show. it's a great place for entertaining out-of-town guests for sure. one time we even had the privilege of being seated at the \"chefs\" table (which is in a private room) with a prime view of the fountain show and the entire kitchen. \n\nthe food .. what can i say .. everything we've tried there is spectacular! my favorites are the <mark>Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti</mark>, which is simply melt-in-your mouth goodness and the tagliatelle with fall vegetables, truffle zabagalione & guanciale, which is just the right amount of truffle and is nice and light. i've also tried that famous spaghetti .. it's good, very good, but not something that i would order again. some of my dining partners have tried the lobster pasta, the <mark>Black Cod</mark> and the <mark>Spiced Duck Breast</mark> and the little bites i tried were good, but not necessarily items i would order. \n\nfrom the starters, my favorites are the <mark>Creamy Polenta</mark>, again with truffle :) and the <mark>Braised Short Ribs of Beef</mark>. the calamari and the scallops are also good, but we keep going back to the polenta. \n\ndessert .. the most important part of the meal .. the second time we were there, we saw something at another table that looked delicious and right up our alley .. turns out it was not on their menu but from the neighboring scott conant eatery docg enoteca. it's called the salted caramel budino with pretzel toffee.  it is super creamy and  the perfect balance of both sweet and salty at the same time. we shared it the first go-around but now order one each whenever we go .. and that rarely happens. \n\nthe service is impeccable, friendly knowledgeable servers and bussers who go the extra mile and have great personalities. the first time we were there my dining partner mentioned she was heading to dc the following weekend and our server came back with a list of fun things / places for her to do while she was there.",

            "surprised my boyfriend with dinner here this past saturday for his birthday. we made reservations for 7:30 and requested a table by the window. we were 5 minutes late because we had to stop by the atm which, by the way, is located right at the foot of the escalator by security. we were greeted by the hostesses and manager who were all friendly. the dining room itself was a lot smaller than i had expected. they were able to accommodate our request and we were seated at a beautiful 2 top with a perfect view of the bellagio fountains. water glasses were immediately filled and a bread basket magically appeared with 3 accompaniments: citrus infused olive oil, eggplant spread and my fav, mascarpone cheese... way better than boring butter! like everyone has already mentioned the bread basket was delish! we also got a bottle of red wine for a great price, $75. we shared everything and for some of the dishes they were actually able to split it in 2 so it would be easier to share! this was my first time tasting fresh pasta and you can most certainly taste a difference. there's a specific bite and texture that can't be compared to that dry stuff at the grocery... \n\n-<mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> tail: 4 very fresh pieces!!! love the salt sprinkled on it. and the pieces were actually pretty thick and not some skimpy thin little things.\n-<mark>Creamy Polenta</mark> with truffled mushrooms: perfect balance of creamy and sweet. i liked it because it was more like a soup for me haha\n-braised short ribs with risotto: tender chunks <mark>Braised Short Ribs of Beef</mark>. tasted like this korean short rib dish that i love. \n-duck & <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark>: my favorite dish of the night. it was so decadent and delicious. if you don't like the taste of strong cheese, you will not like this dish. the sweet marsala sauce paired perfect with it.\n-spaghetti: i'm sure some people have a problem spending $25 on a small plate of spaghetti but it definitely is something everyone should taste at least once. light, fresh sauce with perfectly aldente pasta... it is because of this dish alone my boyfriend had been wanting to come to scarpetta. he has made this recipe a couple times for me and i'm sorry to say but my boyfriend's spaghetti tastes exactly the same.. if not better. but then again my opinion may be biased haha\n-ny strip steak: it was a mistake ordering this because we were so full. we had to force ourselves to finish this dish haha at $55 though i didn't think the steak was that amazing.. it actually had some unwanted gristle on it. but i'm sure it would have tasted a lot better had we not been so full. \n\ni really wanted to get dessert for him and they were going to do something special for us but we were already so late for our show and not to mention so beyond stuffed.. we had to run out of there... literally, we ran out of there! \n\nservice was amazing all night from our server all the way down to the lady who came around with parmesan cheese and chili flakes. but special shout-out to paul k...the friendly food runner/expo who was so polite and quite knowledgeable about all of the food. \n\nthanks scarpetta! \nscott conant, you are hot \n;ppp", 
            "as much as i am critical regarding the outlandish folly that which is the strip, there are, in my opinion, a few exceptional culinary experiences that you can only get here and nowhere else; with breathtaking, majestic feats of visionary engineering, the strip personifies man's ability to create way beyond his present environment and envision a future filled with unlimited possibilities.  and when a night on the town includes that man-made wonderland, you get magic, an 'umami' of all the senses.\n\nscarpetta by chef scott conant encompasses that dining experience, and out of all his venues bearing the same name, i enjoy the vegas restaurant by far.  although all the restaurants are elegant with great food, this restaurant takes the vegas experience and showcases style with understated design gestures.  'scarpetta' means little shoe in italian, a reference to the menu's 'soulfulness'...  guess my mind wandered to other references...like, the foot fetish variety - shrimping anyone?  no? too far?\n\nthe design is deceptively tame; meaning that it's not drenched in the typical vegas gaudy, interior so-five-seconds ago gimmicks that cause visual norovirus.  but once you situate and settle down, you notice the lyrical design flow lending itself to a relaxing, calming evening. by then the fountains at the bellagio will have sprung into full effect, with sweeping side views of the lake and the beautiful architecture as a backdrop for the dynamic geysers bursts - a stunning piece of visual entertainment lasting the night.\n\nafter dining at scarpetta on numerous occasions, i've come to the conclusion that although everything on the menu is good, i naturally gravitate towards the pasta section of the menu.  i enjoy all of the home made pastas and the balance with the ingredients that chef conant pairs with them.  and to be honest, i'm just tired of entrees, they've become burdensome, overpriced and unusually large with the same old formula: big ass protein with some creamy mush underneath it with a side of blah..yawn.  if anything, i'd get some apps, but i've eaten most of them on the menu; i do recommend the <mark>Creamy Polenta</mark> + fricassee of truffled mushrooms, the heirloom beet salad and the <mark>Braised Short Ribs of Beef</mark>. (they push the <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> as their signature classic- really...if i wanted sashimi, i'd go eat at a japanese restaurant where it's served pure, you really don't need any heavy onions or olive oil or jalape\\u00f1os to mask the flavor of this delicious protein.....truth).  \n\nspaghetti + tomato +basil: an all time favorite of mine, this dish is as simple as it can get (it's up there with spaghetti all' aglio olio e pepperoncino) but so fresh and light with just a few ingredients, the pasta shines through as the main character which, being the carb addict that i am, is harmonious!  it's presented as the first dish, based on its levity and absence of protein.  \n\nricotta + truffle agnolotti: the second dish in the fete de pasta is a deep contrast to the acidity of the prior dish, the fluffy pillows filled with ricotta and covered in a light truffle cream sauce.  i love using the term 'pillows', it describes these soft chewy bite size packages of pasta like a metaphoric squishy rest to the head; that, \"ahhh\" moment when your cranium sinks into a downy cloud.....i love sleep..  the creamy truffle white sauce has just enough weight to coat your palate without any buyer's remorse and the quantity is perfect for two.\n\nblack tonarelli + king crab + coddled egg + smoked trout roe: i'm always excited when i see squid ink pasta on any menu - i relish the slightly briny noodle that goes well with all seafood toppings.  with this dish, it's even more decadent with the introduction of the coddled egg, coating every strand with a sticky liquid goo. it's such oral satisfaction.  oh, and there's crab, you really can't go wrong when there's crab.  \n\npici + lobster +preserved tangerine + bottarga: pici is thick cut pasta, a fat spaghetti, akin to udon.  it is hearty and appropriately the last pasta course of the evening.  the pici is paired with lobster, preserved tangerine and bottarga, a cured fish roe.  the bottarga amps up the salty briny element while the the juicy lobster gives a sweet delicate flavor - all the ingredients manage to balance out with the pasta.\n\ncaramella milk chocolate mousse + saut\\u00e9ed <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> peaches + praline crunch + pistachio bastoni: okay, this was a bit of a surprise-under our waiter guidance, we ordered this dessert for the first time... this plate of what can only be described as a kindergarden art project with chocolate squares and pistachio logs....  i wonder if the chefs are so bored that they need to play with the food and at the same time give us less.  and in the end, it didn't really have much flavor as compact as it was- it was like a plate of mignardises that usually come with a post-meal hot beverage.\n\nratings (out of five stars)\nfood:            4.75\nambience:    4.75\nservice:         4.5", 
            "we had a top notch dinner at scarpetta while enjoying the wonderful view of the bellagio water show. the fresh, warm bread basket with a delicious assortment was only a teaser of the wonderful meal to come. the service was excellent,  great detail.  our wine choice-a meursault  went very well with our meal.\nfor our appetizers:\ntuna 'susci'\nmarinated vegetables & preserved truffles -never had fresher tuna, \n<mark>Creamy Polenta</mark>\nfricassee of truffled mushrooms- just perfect, creamy and the fricassee was richly flavorful. \nentrees:\nmediterranean branzino\nshrimp, clams, mussels & celery root - crispy and sophisticated yet simply delicious\n<mark>Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti</mark>\nbrown butter horseradish & toasted breadcrumbs- perfect \ndessert:\nst<mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> souffle\nrhubarb compote & vanilla gelato-so light and satisfying, absolutely no sharing of this dessert. \nmy only disappointment was a side of the fingerling potatoes. they weren't bad but didn't live up to the level of the other dishes we had. \nwe are pleased to learn that they have a scarpetta in nyc. this restaurant warrants many more visits.", 
            "had dinner here on a friday night in vegas.  i've seen scott conant on chopped a hundred times and he always comes across as a little too full of himself, claiming to be the master of pasta.   with this in mind i was actually looking forward to criticizing his restaurant, but i just can't.  \n\ni ordered the <mark>Creamy Polenta</mark> appetizer and shared it with the table.  it was amazing, with the truffled mushrooms blending perfectly with the polenta whose \"creamy\" descriptor in the menu is both descriptive and right on.\n\ni then ordered the duck and <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark>.  i thought it would be too rich, but the portion was just right and somehow, despite it being duck with foie gras, was not too rich.  the pasta was cooked perfectly... damn you conant.  \n\nfor dessert we had the bombolini and the st<mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> souffle, both were great, with the bombolini being the favorite for the table.  \n\nthe dinner was absolutely lovely and everything was very flavorful, in perfect portions and made just right.", 
            "i was very excited to dine here and left feeling like i'd had a really good, not necessarily memorable meal. the best part was the gluten-free menu; that is always easier than \"i don't know, let me check with the kitchen.\". \n\nwe were seated next to the bus station in spite of having a reservation, and there was a table by the window open the entire time we were there. \n\nthe service was excellent, attentive, not obtrusive.\n\nwines by the glass were good, but as another reviewer mentioned, overpriced.\n\nthe food was very good. i had the spaghetti with tomatoes and basil, which many reviews mentioned as \"amazing\". i have a very similar recipe at home that i enjoy equally. the <mark>Creamy Polenta</mark> with mushrooms was a great starter. everyone else enjoyed their meals.\n\nmy husband ordered a flourless <mark>Chocolate Cake</mark>, which he practically inhaled. there were closed eyes and moans of pleasure with each bite.", 
            "was here this past year for ces, and we had 2 events here.\none was our company dinner in the private room with a view of bellagio fountains and the other was a upper management meeting with a client over wine tasting in the private seating area which is in the kitchen.\n\nfor the wine tasting, it was pretty awesome, except the room is probably equipped to seat 8 people comfortably, maybe 10, we squeezed in 12.  we enjoyed some awesome wines and some desserts, which hey mistakenly sent to our table, so they ended up comping those and bringing more, it was very good.  \n\nthe cool thing about this private room, is that you have to walk through the kitchen to get to it and it is located next to the kitchen, with glass floor to ceiling so you can see into the kitchen as they work and cook and the background is a view of the bellagio fountains and the strip.  \n\nthe second occasion was for our company dinner a few nights later since they were able to accommodate our group of 16 in the private dining room that is in front of the restaurant and our big boss loves italian food.  \n\nalthough you can order single entrees off the menu, we had our waiter set up our dinner family style with some of his recommendations and some of the things we wanted to try.  \n\nalso, our big boss had a request for something off the menu and the chef obliged with no problems.  keeping the boss happy is always key!\n\nwe had the following dishes.\napps - braised short rib <mark>Braised Short Ribs of Beef</mark>, <mark>Creamy Polenta</mark>, <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> and <mark>Tuna susci</mark>\nthe short ribs and the polenta were my favorite, the susci was just ok.\n\nentrees - duck and <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark>, <mark>Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti</mark>, sheep milk ricotta agnolotti.  all were awesome, but the duck and <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark> is very rich.\n\nwe had dessert, but i don't actually remember what i had.\n\nservice was great and except the bar was slow, so they comped certain drinks that didn't show up in a time fashion.\n\nthe minus one star was for the sommelier, who seemed to enjoy the sound of his own voice and didn't really consider the requests of the guests at the table.  i understand he is very knowledgeable and he is an expert, but he could dial back the ego and work with the guest.  \n\nother than that, great place, i recommend it and you will not be disappointed.", 
            "we came here on a wednesday evening for a company meeting. our menu consisted of a full course meal: \nprimi - served family style\n1. <mark>Creamy Polenta</mark> - fricassee of truffled mushrooms\n2. heirloom tomato salad - burrata, marinated eggplant \npasta - served family style \n1. spaghetti - tomato and basil \npiatti - individual \n1. fennel dusted <mark>Black Cod</mark> - concentrated tomatoes, mantecato, black olive oil \n2. organic jidori chicken - mustard spatzle carrots, fegato sauce\ndolce - served family style\n1. amedei <mark>Chocolate Cake</mark> - toasted almond gelato, salted caramel sauce\n\n- hard to find! literally, it's like a crevice on the third floor of the cosmo! wtf, weird entrance. \n- nice staff. presentable dining area for larger groups. fast at wine refills. \n- i loved the spaghetti! although simple, the noodles tasted great! the flavoring was fresh and rich. \n- their polenta was unremarkable. cornmeal boiled in porridge. i prefer simple mashed potatoes. \n- fresh tomato salad! loved the ripe tomatoes. but awkward to eat as family-style. \n- the chicken was soft and tender. not too salty. i'm glad i got this over the cod. although the cod was flavored nicely, i didn't like picking some of the bones out of it. \n- dessert was amazing. not too sweet, but the correct balance to end of the meal.\n- overall, nice plating and nice night.",

            "so while at a convention in vegas, my two co-workers and i came here for dinner on 10/6/13 on a recommendation from a friend who claimed it's the best restaurant in the city. all three of us did the tasting menu ($110 per person) and two of us opted for the wine pairing with it (additional $45 per person). with all the delicious looking options on the menu, it seemed this was the way to go. here's what was included: \n\n-duo of <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> and tuna \"susci\". wine pairing: adami, prosecco, veneto, n/v. the \"susci\" was the first tasting and my least favorite of all. nothing special to me. or at least i didn't get what was supposed to be special about it. the roll with the carrots was kind of gross actually. i was hoping things would turn around quickly, and they did. ohhhh they did.\n\n-roasted diver scallops, morels, sugar snap, watermelon radish & pea froth. wine pairing: iberian remix, albarino, edna valley 2009. \nthe scallops were cooked perfectly and i enjoyed the puree that was served on the side. my friend however didn't enjoy the wine that was paired with it. he's a big albarino drinker and said it tasted like \"it was sitting on the shelf a little too long.\" i didn't really notice that until he said it, but i have to agree. that could have just been a bad bottle though and not an accurate representation of the wine itself.\n\n\n-spaghetti tomato basil & <mark>Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti</mark>. wine pairing: il poggione, rosso di montalcino, tuscany 2008. i don't care what anyone says- the spaghetti was fantastic. i'm drinking the kool-aid here. yes, the sauce is very simple, but it really made me notice and appreciate the texture and freshness of the noodles more. sometimes spaghetti is better when it's simple i guess. i would definitely order it again. \n\nthe <mark>Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti</mark>- dish of the night. the three of us unanimously agreed on this. one of the best pasta dishes i've ever devoured in 10 seconds. the horseradish breadcrumbs were a great finishing touch.\n\n-fennel spiced <mark>Black Cod</mark>, concentrated tomatoes, mantecato & black olive oil. wine pairing: jermann red angel, pinot noir, friuli 2008. \nthe cod was spiced well, but maybe a tad undercooked for my liking. i still finished it. \n\n-<mark>Spiced Duck Breast</mark>, endive, preserved orange &\ncippollini. wine pairing: feudi di san gregorio, rubrato, aglianico, campania 2009. the duck was perfectly cooked and had tremendous flavor. my friend sitting next to me was already so stuffed by this point, that he couldn't eat his, so being the fat fuck that i am, i ate his too.\n\n-amedei <mark>Chocolate Cake</mark> toasted almond gelato. wine pairing: quinta do noval, colheita, tawny port, portugal 1997. i'm normally not a big dessert guy, but this cake was outstanding. perfect way to cap off the tasting.\n\n...and here were a few complimentary items our table was given to share:\n\n- bread basket. it was served with three different dips (citrus olive oil, tomato-eggplant, and marscapone butter). some of the pieces of bread had salami baked into it, and those were amazing! just try not to fill up on them if you're doing the tasting menu, because you have a lot of food on the way.\n\n- <mark>Creamy Polenta</mark> with fricassee of truffled mushrooms. the polenta was definitely one of the highlights, although it could have benefited from being a tad thicker since the mushroom sauce liquified it significantly, once mixed  in. but great flavors, nonetheless.\n\n- shoe string calamari and zucchini. i think there was some fennel in here too. we finished every last string.\n\n\nall three of us immensely enjoyed the tasting menu. to say that we were not left disappointed by the portion sizes would be an understatement. we could barely walk out of there without toppling over. i certainly didn't have much room for alcoholic beverages for the remainder of the night. probably a good thing, knowing me and vegas.\n\nyou might notice i didn't have much to say about the wines. that's because unlike the food, they were all pretty unremarkable. i'm a pretty avid wine drinker and i didn't recognize any of these wines by name before they were poured for me, so it was almost expected. if i ever did the tasting menu again, i'd most likely skip the wine pairing option and just order a bottle of something decent and familiar off their wine menu. \n\nmy biggest gripe about this place was the waiter. although friendly and accommodating, he could barely be heard over the background noise, and with his thick accent, it made him very difficult to understand. tastings obviously are supposed to be interactive and i had to ask him to repeat everything he said at least once. this became a little frustrating and kind of depreciated the experience for me. i wish he had left a copy of the menu on our table so i didn't have to go to their website afterward to finally discover what some of the things i ate were.\n\nthe bottom line is i would definitely return to scarpetta, especially since i just realized there is one in beverly hills (doh!).", 
            "absolutely amazing!   customized everything we requested, very friendly staff, and the vegetarian options were incredible.  i had the <mark>Creamy Polenta</mark> as a dinner option and was blown away.  david had the fois <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark> and was so happy!  will definitely come back", 
            "my family and i dined here in nov and ordered an array of dishes. i forgot our waiter's name but he was a tall slender gentleman w. a beautiful smile. his service was very memorable. he was knowledgeable w. the menu and i ordered one of his recommendations;\n\n<mark>Creamy Polenta</mark>: creamy and rich!\n\nsicilian-<mark>Spiced Duck Breast</mark> with preserved orange, root vegetables and caramelized endive. i was pleasantly surprised. \n\nduck & <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark>- rich rich rich and flavorful. \n\nmediterranean orata- very light and flavorful. the fish skin was crispy and the meat was moist.\n\nthe dinner was good but it was the desserts that made it great!\n\nthe st<mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> souffle and it was delish!! -i wish i could remember the name of the other desserts because they were all really out of this world too. \n\nthe dinner was ok but hats off to the pastry chef and our fantastic waiter!", 
            "amazing pasta.  my mom says it's not as good as italy but it is pretty dang close, and that's good enough for me.\n\nparking: it's located in the cosmo, third floor i believe at the corner near the restrooms, it's kind of small random entrance.  free parking at all lv hotels and a quick walk from any of the hotels on the strip.\n\natmosphere: dark, with a great view of the bellagio water fountains.  ask for a window seat if you're with a group of 2, if you have a bigger group you can still get pretty close but not right up to the window.  there were actually a lot of big groups that we saw and they have several private rooms for big parties like birthdays or celebrations, which i thought was cool.\n\nfood: had to get the spaghetti with tomato and basil.  it doesn't look like a lot in the pictures but when you  unravel the pasta, it's plenty for one person especially if you're going to be getting any appetizers or dessert.\n\nbread basket - they give you all kinds of bread, sourdough, focaccia, stromboli (i think thats what its called with salami and cheese) and for those allergic to dairy, the foccacia is dairy free!!\n\n<mark>Creamy Polenta</mark> - sooo good, and i don't even like polenta!! it's creamy like mashed potatoes and so flavorful (prob a lot of butter) with the mushrooms it was perfect.\n\ntuna 'susci' - also very good, and very fresh! a tun roll but the tuna was wrapped around the outside, i dont remember what was inside but it was tasty.  \n\nspaghetti - so amazing.  they hand make it everyday and you can tell.  it was al dente and chewy, fresh!! and the sauce was delicious, light but flavorful and something that seemed so simple but blew me away.  also for those allergic to dairy they can make it without butter and milk and my sister said it tasted just as good.  i tried a piece and it was good, but definitely not as flavorful as mine.  \n\namedei <mark>Chocolate Cake</mark> - your basic rich, <mark>Chocolate Cake</mark> with a slight runny inside.  it was a great way to end the night but by the end of it i was  completely stuffed.\n\noverall, a great place to try if you're looking for a fancy place in vegas.  the pasta is like $26 and the atmosphere, although not the best i've ever had, is good and romantic for a date or a fancy dinner with the family.  just make sure you get a good window seat!",

            "i am a fan of scott conant from chopped fame but i have to say the las vegas outpost of his iconic nyc restaurant just did not live up to the hype.  i went with a group of guys and we ordered the tasting menu.  they were nice enough to allow us to order it on a friday night since it is usually not offered on that night of the week.  we tasted 8 dishes for $110 pp.  the quantity of food was great - really full at the end of the meal - but most of the dishes were just ok.\n\nthe real highlight for me was the <mark>Creamy Polenta</mark> with truffled mushrooms.  wow, that was delicious.  probably the creamiest polenta i've ever had and it paired so nicely with the earthiness of the truffles and mushrooms.   the <mark>Chocolate Cake</mark> served for the dessert course was also terrific, served with toasted almond gelato.  too bad i was so full by that time i could only have a couple of bites.  nothing else was particularly memorable.  \n\ndisappointing for me was the restaurant's signature spaghetti - a seemingly simple preparation of pasta, fresh tomatoes and basil.  it arrived very simply plated -  a perfect cylinder mold of spaghetti covered by a clear plastic cloche that i suppose is meant to preserve the freshness of the preparation or perhaps to concentrate the aroma.  the cloches are removed with a flourish releasing nice smells of tomato and basil.  the pasta was a bit overcooked and the sauce, while wonderfully creamy (how do they do that?) was just too sweet, as if chef conant and chef boyardee had a bastard love-child.\n\nanother disappointment was the <mark>Black Cod</mark>.  in the past i have found this fish to be among the most delicious owing to its high fat content and buttery texture and flavor.  scarpetta's rendition of this fish, pan-roasted with concentrated tomatoes and roasted fennel, was so overcooked that it was unrecognizable as <mark>Black Cod</mark>.  just a piece of fish.\n\nother dishes were a bit more successful including the <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> of <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> and tuna, the diver scallops, the short rib/<mark>Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti</mark> and the <mark>Spiced Duck Breast</mark>.\n\nthe wine list is voluminous and expensive.  the cocktail menu offers some nice selections.\n\nthere is certainly a lot of eye candy to be enjoyed at this swank place in the cosmo.  however, one annoying thing was the lighting.  over every table there is a large fixture containing multiple <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark>/gold colored lights.  this lighting casts the food in a weird color and makes taking pictures of the food impossible.  all the food looks bad in the pictures i took - i suppose that's no surprise that the pictures were a disappointment too.", 
            "5 star! we were in vegas celebrating a bachelorette party this past weekend and i made reservations for scarpetta at cosmo.  it is one of my favorite places in la and i figured i couldn't go wrong at their las vegas location.  they exceeded expectations.  i made reservations for 7 on opentable and due to a very long taxi line at our hotel we were running a bit late, i called them and they were kind to let me know that they would seat us when we arrive and not to worry.  dinner was remarkable per usual as was the excellent service.  they were aware of our celebration and the staff made sure to congratulate our bride personally and with a desert! the waiter and his crew were extremely friendly and before we knew it 2 hrs had passed us by and we left happy and very full. i cant wait to go back!\n\nwhat we ordered:\nfarmer's market salad\n<mark>Crispy Fritto Misto</mark> \n<mark>Creamy Polenta</mark> - amazing\nroasted diver scallops\n<mark>Braised Short Ribs of Beef</mark>\nspaghetti - 4 out of 7 of us ordered this dish and all of us finished the entire bowl\nfettuccine  - if youre going to order the pasta dont be foolish order spaghetti\nprime filet <mark>Braised Short Ribs of Beef</mark> - amazing!\n\nthe drinks were also delicious! the lemon drop martini and shots especially.",

            "scarpetta never disappoints!  above and beyond friendly service and amazing food.  we started with the scallops.  they were roasted with just the amount of crust.  next was were the braised shorts ribs - tender and so much flavor!  the <mark>Creamy Polenta</mark> with mushrooms - omg!  i so want to lick my plate!  i had the duck and <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark> - rich and smooth and yummy!  my gf had the lobster pasta.  the pasta was perfect with a delicious spicy sauce (i know because i \"helped\" my friend out when she stepped out!)  for dessert, we shared the <mark>Coconut Panna Cotta</mark>.  it was a sprint, our spoons flying.  next time, we will get our own!",

            "damn you scott conant. \n\nwe made a reservation here and were all excited to be judgmental pricks about the food (you know, the way scott is on chopped). but it was amazing. we could not find anything to judge harshly.\n\nfirst, try to request a table by the window/with a view. the restaurant has an amazing view of the bellagio fountain at night. \n\nwe did the tasting menu and it was totally worth it. one of the best meals i've ever had and so filling. second tip: do not fill up on the delicious bread at the beginning of the meal if you are doing the tasting menu. we were so stuffed but we actually finished our whole meal. the waiter commented that we were the first to actually finish the tasting menu in a month because everyone fills up on bread and ends up not being able to finish their dishes. \n\namazing food. imo highlights were the <mark>Creamy Polenta</mark> and <mark>Black Cod</mark>.", 
            "well the view alone makes this a spectacular dining experience. ask to sit near the window when making reservations so you have a nice view of the bellagio fountains at night. we started off with the <mark>Creamy Polenta</mark> with mushrooms and oh sweet god was it delicious. every single bite was amazing. we then ordered the <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark> and the spaghetti with marinara sauce. i know spaghetti sounds like such a simple thing to order but our waiter was raving about it. he was right- it was done to perfection. i will have to try the scarpetta in nyc and see how it compares", 
            "*** review is for restaurant week august 2014 menu ***\n\nanother restaurant that i've wanted to try now marked off the list.  the restaurant week menu is somewhat limited in selections, but what it has was very good.\n\ni was seated next to the window overlooking the bellagio and the fountains which added to the good atmosphere of the restaurant.  i was brought menus and an iced tea.  i had to ask for the restaurant week menu and it was brought.  i had already made my choice from the online menu but sometimes things change so i wanted to make sure.\n\ni was brought a nice bread basket with sourdough and three other breads.  accompanying it was a trio of bread toppers/dippers--mascarpone butter, caponata, and a citrus infused olive oil.  all three were good, but i could have eaten a plate of the caponata!  the mild citrus flavor in the olive oil made that my second choice.\n\nfor the starter, i ordered the <mark>Creamy Polenta</mark> with fricassee of truffled mushrooms.  the polenta was brought in a white dish and the server then spooned the onion and wild mushroom mixture over the polenta.  the dish was excellent.  i almost took some bread to wipe up any leftover polenta.\n\nfor the main course, i got the fennel dusted <mark>Black Cod</mark> on a bed of concentrated tomatoes and roasted fennel.  the fish was cooker perfectly and was moist and soft but with a crisp crust.  the crust had a mild anise flavor from the fennel.  the tomatoes beneath, concentrated by baking until some of the water was rendered which gave the tomato a prominent flavor.  the roasted fennel was tasty.\n\nfor dessert, there was no choice but that didn't matter.  the bomboloni was a wonderful way to end a good meal.  the bomboloni consisted of two filled with nutella ganache and one was filled with a vanilla cream.  alongside was a small scoop of banana ice cream resting on crushed chocolate shortbread pieces.  excellent!\n\nservice was good for the most part.  two small things--when your posted opening time is 6 pm, open at 6.  seating people almost 10 minutes late is not the best form especially if someone has a show they need to get to.  also, i had two sweet 'n low wrappers on the table that neither a runner nor the server cleared even though both were by several times.  that's something you wouldn't expect from a restaurant of this class.  i'm sure chef conant would point this out if he were dining there.  i wish i didn't have to ask for the restaurant week menu.  it was a sheet of paper.  bring it with your large books of wine and dinner menus.", 
            "i have dreamt about eating the spaghetti here for years. for years. and when that spaghetti and i finally met and dined together, it did not disappoint. the spaghetti noodles are cooked to an al dente. rather than the spaghetti sauce poured on top, the noodles are simmered and cooked with simple sauce. the starch from the noodles holds onto the flavors bringing together the noodles and sauce. the spaghetti here is divine.\n\nin addition to the spaghetti, our table also shared the <mark>Creamy Polenta</mark> with truffled mushrooms, the <mark>Braised Short Ribs of Beef</mark>, and the <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark>. all of which were equally as good.\n\nthe service was subpar. our table had to constantly flag our waiter down. for a fine dining establishment, i felt like we were jipped. on top of the inattentiveness, my friend encountered a shard of plastic/glass in her salad. lemme tell you, whatever she bit into was hard. hard. everyone at the table felt it and indeed, the shard was tough and hard. we sent the dish back to the kitchen and the chef simply said that we were mistaken and that shard was actually just a piece of hard sea salt....uh. okay. clearly that piece of salt sea did not melt in my friend's mouth and it was hard. sea salt my ass.\n\nthe food is good, but go to the one in beverly hills. this place sucks. and maybe they cater toward out of towners who don't know any better, but for the vast majority- we know what fine dining should look and feel like and this certainly is not it.", 
            "hidden on the third floor of the cosmopolitan, scarpetta is the place to visit to learn what really good pasta can be like.\n\nas a pasta fiend, i am very picky when it comes to pasta.  scarpetta has shown me another dimension to pasta that i must learn.  the minimalist approach where pasta is the star, and the sauce or other items are addendums.\n\nallow me to expound:\n\nsignature spaghetti: normally a staple of the american diet, lifted from italy, it is most commonly served with tomato, carbonara, or meat sauce. since i make spaghetti at home, i always believed in what i thought i liked.  this dish showed me that a very simple, light sauce can accompany the pasta and \"show it off\" in a way that the pasta shines above the sauce.  a large portion is not required as the fresh pasta is rich and heavy.  the sauce is light, and delicately flavorful, allowing the pasta flavor to come out instead of being more of a \"texture\" experience.  when presented with this dish, one might think \"where is the sauce?\", but when finished the response will be: \"i didn't miss it\"\n\nduck & <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark>:  again, simple in presentation and execution, the difference is in the details.  i normally don't like duck, and find foie gras to be overly rich and intense when served alone.  the blended filling, in just the right proportion to pasta was a grand pleasure and i will be looking or any excuse to have this dish again.  again, the sauce is minimal at best and the dish relies on the pasta and filling almost entirely to achieve its goal.\n\nlesson learned: extravagant sauces are used to cover up mediocre pasta offerings\n\nappetizer bonus: <mark>Creamy Polenta</mark> with fricassee of mushroom: this dish, served in a moderately small portion was a flavor and texture experience that reinforces the axiom that quality is small amounts is the most flavorful, and healthy for you experience.  having watched its manufacture on the food channel, the secret is in the long prep.  like tamahagane, it must be nurtured for hours (3) to achieve the complete assimilation of the polenta kernel into the dish, resulting in a creaminess of exceptional quality.\n\nall in all, i learned the perception of the minimalist, the discipline of the stalwart, and the reminder that food is art in the presentation.\n\nmy most basic position:  i will look for any excuse to visit scarpetta in the future.\n\nsundries:  as with any restaurant of this caliber, service was impeccable.  even though i dined alone on several occasions, several people inquired as to my satisfaction each visit.  i cannot say enough.  as a lone diner, i felt as attended to as any other party and normally i can't stand eating alone as one tends to get treated like a pariah.  not the case here!", 
            "we came with a party of 5 for dinner. our view was amazing. we were seated right next to the window. we could see the bellagio water fountains every time it went off. if i were to base my rating just on the ambiance and view of the restaurant, i'd give it a 5. \n\nunfortunately, the food wasn't impressive for the price. i had the pici and shared the <mark>Creamy Polenta</mark>. the pici had a really good chili pesto sauce. the pasta and lobster was perfectly cooked. but i expected the dish to wow me and it didn't. my favorite dish was the polenta. it was delicious. \n\nour server was friendly. i think it's worth a try, especially if you can get a view of the fountains. i think there are other restaurants in vegas that are great and better priced. i'm not sure i'd come back.",

            "this is a wonderful addition to the las vegas food scene. this is not your father's olive garden - this is a fine dining italian food experience. side note - it's not inexpensive. i'm happy to say that someone else picked up the tab for my visit and encouraged me to order whatever i wanted, so i did.\n\nthe service is what you'd expect from a restaurant like this - the entire staff is attentive, polite and knowledgeable.  i had some questions about a few of the dishes and my server didn't give me the old, \"hang on, let me check\" or the bald faced lie.  \n\ni started with the <mark>Creamy Polenta</mark> mostly because i've never had <mark>Creamy Polenta</mark> before. it was good. not what i expected, but it was quite tasty. an excellent starter.\n\nsince i wasn't paying, i ordered the veal chop which comes with a side of spaghetti, squash, and mushrooms.  cooked perfectly and it was delicious.\n\nalthough i was full my host had ordered a banana souffle and i hated to see it go to waste.  wow - just wow.\n\nexcellent food and service in a beautifully appointed restaurant.  no, it wasn't cheap but it was well worth the price. note - they also have a gluten free and vegetarian menus.",

            "ate at scarpetta's on a wednesday night, week before new year's so it wasn't packed, got seated by a really friendly hostess. upon sitting down we were offered two types of water, nice touch. a few minutes later passed and we were greeted by the assistant manager kelly, asked if this had been our first time and we replied yes. \n\nknowing the executive chef dan rossi, we were treated to having him select our food and then having his wine sommelier (paulo) pair wines with each course. if you know very little about wines, like myself, i would highly recommend paulo making the decisions for you, this guy is a master at his trade. our wines complimented each course perfectly and it truly made the night one to remember. \n\ntrying to remember everything we ate would be a six page review so i'll just touch on a few must haves, not that we didn't thoroughly enjoy every dish, because everything was an orgasmic explosion of flavors on the tongue, but i'm going to keep this short and sweet. polenta with a five mushroom ragu, unbelievable. their signature spaghetti, out of this world. ravioli's with foie gras and duck, i could have eaten 20. some carmel pudding dessert with this homemade salted carmel toffee with crushed pretzels was insane. that was just a few of the fifteen things we got, also <mark>Crispy Fritto Misto</mark>, is a must. \n\nbasically your not going to go wrong with anything in this place, food is off the hook, service staff paid attention to every detail and the view of the strip is the best. this will be on my stop every time i visit vegas from here on out, period.", 
            "the final meal of our vegas escapade was well spent at scarpetta. it wasn't completely perfect but most of the night made up for the little missteps (we'll get to that later) so for the most part, i had nothing but a good time. attentive service, rich indulgent food, all housed within an intimate space with gorgeous views of the ballagio fountains, we closed our trip in pure hedonistic style.\n\nwe started with some of their signature cocktails as we browsed the menu. upon the recommendation from our fantastic server, and the joys of libation, we decided on the tasting menu ($99) and accompanying wine pairing ($49) since several of the dishes that we wanted to try were on it anyway and boy did we pick right. that was the beginning of six courses of pure pleasure.\n\nwe started with a sashimi plate (http://www.<mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark>.com/biz_photos/0nmtwqyeqikerdv4a55obg?select=yvhgcff5cqsiopyc83uwwa) which consisted of <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> with a drizzle of ginger oil and red onions. the other half of the plate sat the <mark>Tuna susci</mark> - tuna wrapped marinated vegetables. the fish was so fresh and the flavors were delicately balanced. the bread basket came shortly after and there was a nice selection including yummy foccacia and stromboli. as part of the tasting menu, the chef also threw in a couple of surprises and we were treated to a delightful seafood <mark>Crispy Fritto Misto</mark> for this course. perfectly crispy fried but not oily, every bite was yummy and the rock shrimp just melted in my mouth.  \n\nthe next course was a perfectly roasted sea scallop. (http://www.<mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark>.com/biz_photos/0nmtwqyeqikerdv4a55obg?select=06qyvnxbie8hftnykn4obw) it was a joy to eat and the velvety salmoriglio sauce was a nice accompaniment to the sweet and juicy scallop. the chef's extra this course was a polenta with a truffle mushroom stew. (http://www.<mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark>.com/biz_photos/0nmtwqyeqikerdv4a55obg?select=gtrwgpr4xgghmw0rvryanw) for the record i hate cornmeal and thus hate grits, tamales, and polenta. yet, i could not stop eating this polenta. the flavors of the mushroom stew combine with the impeccably smooth polenta. (i suspect there's a whole lot more butter in it than what chef scott conant lets on) it was a nice double headliner with the scallop. \n\nnext up was the pasta course and chef conant's signature tomato & basil spaghetti. (http://www.<mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark>.com/biz_photos/0nmtwqyeqikerdv4a55obg?select=jqrljq4g8bgizxs0bc8bow) fresh made pasta in a simple tomato basil (+ quarter stick of butter) sauce but just perfectly executed. while i thoroughly enjoyed it, the chef's extra this course, the <mark>Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti</mark> with brown butter horseradish & toasted breadcrumb (http://www.<mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark>.com/biz_photos/0nmtwqyeqikerdv4a55obg?select=wzfcolektvylois628h_ag), totally blew my mind. wow who would have thought that the combination of short ribs, horseradish, and toasted breadcrumbs could be so sublime? i miss it already as i speak. \n\nthe next course was the <mark>Black Cod</mark>. (http://www.<mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark>.com/biz_photos/0nmtwqyeqikerdv4a55obg?select=2tmoceavt5t4aeu8j6itra) again perfectly seared but wonderfully moist in the middle. the fatty fish absolutely stands out against the sauce and caramelized fennel. delicious. the next entree course was a the <mark>Spiced Duck Breast</mark>. (http://www.<mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark>.com/biz_photos/0nmtwqyeqikerdv4a55obg?select=br1frh72uravjtrhiq6w-a) while this was my least favorite dish of the night, it was still absolutely delicious which tells you the quality of the food all night. the orange and spices (i kept picking up 5 spice) worked well with gamy duck. all in all, a successful combination. \n\nfinal course and dessert was a <mark>Chocolate Cake</mark> with toasted almond gelato and caramel. (http://www.<mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark>.com/biz_photos/0nmtwqyeqikerdv4a55obg?select=udi5apzqgqwuqcgjvukosg) this is where i really had to throw in the towel after all that eating. the <mark>Chocolate Cake</mark> was really rich and decadent and i could only finish half of it but i just couldn't let the toasted almond gelato go to waste. it was just delicious. you can totally taste the toasted flavor. \n\nnow on to the kink of the night. since we were seated by the wine cellar, the sommelier came by several times to retrieve bottles of wine. each single time, he let the door hit me as i was eating without even acknowledging it, much less apologize. not that it was a deal breaker but you expect a little more basic courtesy especially when you're dropping good money on dinner. \n\nstill for a wonderfully decadent meal paired with friendly and attentive service, we had a good time and i strongly recommend scarpetta if you want to treat yourself to a fine meal on the strip.", 
            "scott conant really is a genius. service was attentive and part of the overall amazing experience. matthew was our server and was incredible. tuna \"suchi\", <mark>Crispy Fritto Misto</mark>, spaghetti, duck and <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark> were all outstanding dishes. we will definitely be coming back.", 
            "the bread basket alone would bring me back! that stromboli is amazing! i love salami and bread, so put the two together.....fuggetaboutit!\n\nwe had the tasting menu: \n\n- duo of <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> and tuna \"susci\": melt in your mouth delicious!\n\n- roasted sea scallops, cauliflower, bottarga, chili and caper salmoriglio: sea scallops can be rubbery and chewy if not cooked properly, but at scarpetta, they were cooked to perfection. they had the consistency of flaky, firm fish and the roasted cauliflower was a perfect pairing.\n\n- spagetti tomato basil - simple and good, but not memorable.\n\n- <mark>Black Cod</mark>, caramelized fennel & concentrated tomatoes - the fish was nice and flakey and the tomatoes added a nice acidity to the fish. i'm not a fan of fennel as they are too \"licorice-y\" in flavor for my taste.\n\n- <mark>Spiced Duck Breast</mark>, endive, preserved orange and cippollini - delicious! i love duck, but i hate when its not cooked properly or tastes overly fatty. this was a perfect balance. the preserved orange cut through the richness of the duck. yum!\n\n- amedei <mark>Chocolate Cake</mark> & toasted almond gelato - toasted almond gelato & salted caramel sauce. self explanatory....it was heaven!\n\nwhat made this experience special was that the chef brought out a few mini appetizers with every dish served, so it was like having an \"extended\" tasting menu. he brought out:\n\n- <mark>Crispy Fritto Misto</mark> - seafood, vegetables, artichokes, herbs & lemon\n- <mark>Creamy Polenta</mark> - fricassee of truffled mushrooms: by far my favorite dish at scarpetta. upon first glance, it looks like it would be too heavy and rich, but it was amazing!\n- <mark>Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti</mark> - brown butter horseradish & toasted breadcrumb.\n- zeppole - nutella center, vanilla sauce and candied hazelnuts. need i say more?\n\ni loved the ambiance and service of this restaurant. we were seated by the window facing the fountains of bellagio. a beautiful place to take someone on a date!", 
            "the wife and i were in vegas on vacation and her younger cousin and his gf were in town the same week so we wanted to take them out to a nice dinner.  i didn't have a chance to check out scarpetta when i was last here in november, so this seemed like a perfect time.  \n\nthe room is absolutely beautiful, and we were lucky enough to get seated near a window, so we could also watch the bellagio fountain show at the same time.  i was thinking, this night is going to be perfect right......maybe not.  so the server comes to take our drink order.  i'm a simple guy, so i just ordered a miller lite.......he kind of looks at me and is like \" bud \".  i'm like ok, nevermind.  can i get a stella instead?  he's like yup.  i'm like.... ok.  then he leaves and the busser brings over the bread basket full of win~!  the bread was a salami roll, as well as some focaccia, and what looked like some french baguette.  the busser really explained the different condiments they had for the bread well.  he had a thick accent, so it was a little difficult to understand, but he did a nice job explaining it.  he left and our server came back with the beer....a bud.  i'm like...seriously, i just told you  stella?  then my wife's cousin asks him a bit about the condiments (mascarpone, some eggplant tapenade, and some olive oil) and if there is a certain one that is recommended for the different breads.   he's like i don't know, they're all good.  i'm like....seriously?  then we get around to ordering our apps and entrees.  we started with the braised shortribs and the <mark>Crispy Fritto Misto</mark>.....both were great.  the shortribs were very tender and flavorful.  the <mark>Crispy Fritto Misto</mark>,was crunchy and not oily either.  we then ordered our entrees. my wife and her cousin ordered the <mark>Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti</mark>, the cousins gf ordered the lamb loin.  haha, we could already tell how our waiter was, so for fun, she asked him how the lamb was.  you would think at a nicer upscale restaurant like this, he would boast about the preparation, or the sauce, or how tender the meat was......nope.  when she asked how it was, he said \"good.\"  really?  i thought restaurants made money by putting crap on the menu?  anyways, back to lucky old me.  i asked the waiter about the spaghetti with basil (which is what lots of people rave about) or the stracci.  he was like it's ok, but it's kind of plain.  not sure if he was trying to upsell me, but i don't know if scott conant would appreciate one of his servers calling his food plain.  anyways, i took his advice and order the stracci.  or did i?  because even if i ordered the stracci, that's not what was placed in front of me when the rest of the order came around.  i looked at the guy and was like \"didn't i tell you stracci?\"  oh, i'm not sure, let me check.  seriously?  what the hell, can this really be happening.  anyways, i waited patiently like a fool, while everybody else ate.  to scarpetta's defense, all the entrees were really good and flavorful, just the guy serving us needed a clue.  we moved on to dessert and ordered the <mark>Chocolate Cake</mark> (a bit too heavy for me), the <mark>Coconut Panna Cotta</mark> (awesome!), and the cheesecake (light, airy, completely delicious).  the waiter comped us an order of zeppole's for his lack of service, and it too was great.  \n\noverall, i was just disappointed that the service was so poor.  i was really looking forward to having a wonderful night with family and friends, but it ended up just being ok.  too bad", 
            "prime location, delicious food, and great service...our meal at scarpetta was definitely one of the highlights of our vegas trip. there were a few missteps on our food adventure, but not nearly discouraging enough to detract from the overall experience. \n\nwe made reservations for 6:30 on thursday night, which seemed to be the latest time to arrive and get one of the tables overlooking the bellagio fountains. we got the last one available. the only issue with the view is that there is a giant metal bar running exactly eye level across the window, so you have to pop your head up like a little meercat just to get a glimpse of the fountains. oh well.\n\nwe ordered the tasting menu and told the waiter that we'd like a bottle of white wine, somewhere in the semi-sweet to semi dry range, full-to-medium bodied, in the $50-60 range. the waiter brought us two options to taste, and we went with a delicious riesling. the bread course came with a lovely tray of marscapone cheese whipped butter, lemon infused olive oil, and a delicious fresh tomato spread. we didn't eat too much, because we knew we had seven courses of awesome heading our way:\n\n1) the first course was <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> and tuna sushi. the <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> was served with thin pink rock salt wafers that complemented the fish perfectly. the tuna was rolled around marinated vegetables and served with preserved mushrooms. everything was light, fresh, and flavorful. an excellent way to start a meal. a <mark>Crispy Fritto Misto</mark> came on the side - the tempura fried herbs and lemon were a delicious addition to the standard tempura fare - shrimp...veggies...etc.\n\n2) the second course was a sea scallop served on top of cauliflower, with a cauliflower puree, chili oil, and a salad with capers on top. - the capers were a bit salty for my liking, so i pulled them off, and the cauliflower with the cauliflower puree was a little redundant, but oh. my. goodness. that scallop was the best i've ever had. the crust was perfectly carmelized, and the scallop inside was tender and melted in your mouth. the small trace of heat from the chili oil added an unexpected twist to the dish and really took it to another level. \n\n3) the chef added in course number three - <mark>Creamy Polenta</mark> with truffled mushrooms. my biggest complaint here is that i can never eat anyone else's polenta again. amazing doesn't even begin to describe it. my friend and i dove into this lake of creamy, buttery, savory goodness with reckless abandon, knowing full well that we were completely spoiling our appetite for the four remaining courses. if nobody had been watching, i would have licked the bowl. we took a little break before moving on in the meal.\n\n4) the pasta course was both a super high and super low note in the meal. after seeing scott conant revered as the king of spaghetti on television time after time, we finally got to see what all the fuss was about. the simple spaghetti dish was amazing. i have never had pasta so perfectly al dente. there was a bite to it that other pastas lack, almost to the point where you feel like it will stick in your teeth, but it doesn't. it was served with a fresh tomato basil sauce that was so perfect, it didn't need any fancy infused oils or architechtural garnishes. it was just pasta perfection. \nhowever, the short ribs angnolotti with brown butter horseradish sauce was just awful. the horseradish sauce blew away every other flavor on the plate, and it wound up tasting like a big plate of mustard. this is the awkward thing about not liking a dish in a tasting course - we were only halfway through the meal and we'd had such good courses previously, that we felt a little awkward sending it back...so we just moved forward with the meal.\n\n5) the next course was a <mark>Black Cod</mark> with concentrated tomato sauce and carmelized fennel. perfect crispy skin, rich, flavorful sauce, and crunchy fresh veggies - definitely a hit.\n\n6) <mark>Spiced Duck Breast</mark> with endive, cippolini onions, and a preserved orange - this dish was ingenious. the duck, endive, and onion were perfectly cooked, but it was the addition of the super thin slice of sweet preserved orange that really made the dish. \n\n7) dessert - simply outstanding - a chocolate lava cake on a streak of carmel sauce with toasted almond gelato on a bed of chocolate cookie crumbs, with a delicate twirl of chocolate as a garnish. \n\nthe only problem with this meal is that it was so delicious, there was no way you could leave anything on your plate. my friend and i polished off every dish - which left us feeling so full that we barely made it out of the restaurant.\n\nif you decide to attempt this delicious seven course food adventure - open your wallets wide - food, drinks, and tip set us back $350...but it was well worth it.", 
            "phenomenal restaurant. i've had the pleasure to dine at some pretty great places around the country and this was in the top 5. \n\nlet's start with the food. delicious. basically perfect. one down side - they were not offering the tasting menu the evening i was there. as a fan of tasting menus (especially with wine pairings!) this was disappointing. anyway, as others have mentioned, the bread is great. we also started with the short rib risotto appetizer as well as the <mark>Crispy Fritto Misto</mark>. both were delightful. as far as the entrees - myself and my 3 dining partners all got pasta. the spaghetti (again, as many other reviewers have commented on) was wonderful. i don't think i've ever ordered spaghetti at a restaurant and probably wouldn't had i not read the rave reviews on <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> (though the waiter did highly recommend it). it was simple yet extremely tasty. the only gripe i have is it seemed a little overpriced given the minimalistic dish (~$24) but was fair given the prices of other dishes on the menu. we also tried the duck and <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark> which was rich and delicious. the beef short rib pasta was also very good, though a little too horseradishy for my taste. \n\nthe food would've earned the restaurant 5 stars in my book regardless, but the service made the experience one of a kind. maybe the waiter has the same \"routine\" for everyone, but who cares? he was attentive, friendly, professional but not at all annoying. \n\nthe only bad part about the night is i didn't get to try dessert (too full)!", 
            "after much research on where to dine for our five year wedding anniversary, my husband and i decided on scarpetta. the menu looked delicious and the prices weren't outrageous. we called about three weeks in advance to make our reservation for seven people. i was surprised that they only had one time left but was very happy we were able to get in at 7:30pm. we were all super excited to dine there. i tweeted about it and they even tweeted back at me, which i thought was a nice touch. \n\nwe arrived a few minutes early for our reservation and only had to wait about five minutes for a table. we were hoping for a table by the window but didn't get one. we were near the wine wall but could still see the bellagio fountains. \n\ni'll break this review into two parts.\n\nservice:\ni'd never been to a higher end restaurant like this before, so i was expecting exceptional service like i had never previously received. while the service was very good, it didn't live up to my expectations. our waiter was a really nice guy, but i think he might have been newer because he seemed a little bit awkward and shy. also, i asked him to take a picture of our whole group and he forgot. then two people had to leave so when he finally did take the pic, not everyone was there. there was another man (paul?) who was in charge of the wine and he was another story. he was so suave and charming. i wish he could have been our waiter! there was a major glitch in our evening considering the type of place we were at. we receieved our bill, and as we were looking over it we realized they put two $125 bottles of wine on it rather than just the one. i'm glad we noticed, because that's a fairly big mistake to make. service in general was on the slower side. there were many gaps where nobody came to our table. we were there for about two hours. the guy refilling the water glasses was really nice, though.\n\nfood:\nbetween the seven of us, we ordered:\n-<mark>Crispy Fritto Misto</mark> (x2)\n-heirloom tomato salad\n-<mark>Creamy Polenta</mark>\n-tagliatelle (x2) (this is what i ordered)\n-duck and <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark>\n-spaghetti\n-pea tortelli\n-i know i'm missing one, but i can't remember/obviously didn't try a bite.\n\ni had bites of everything and it was all delicious. of course, the bread starter was fantastic. the polenta was great and rich. the ravioli was so rich, i wouldn't have been able to eat it as my main dish. it was also incredibly salty. it might be nice in a smaller size as a starter. the vegetables in my tagliatelle were super fresh - such a difference fresh veggies make! the spaghetti was very good, fresh and delicious, but it didn't knock my socks off like it has for some other people. of all of the pastas i tried, i would order the pea tortelli next time. the portion sizes are not large, but just a nice amount to leave you satisfied and not bursting. \n\nthe atmosphere of the restaurant was nice. not as intimate as i wanted, but i think we would have had to spend more somewhere else for that. i was sort of surprised that there were a lot of skimpily dressed stagettes and dudes in t-shirts and baseball hats! \n\nwe had a very good experience here but it just fell a bit short of my expectations based on the many other reviews i read.", 
            "my girlfriend and i spent our thanksgiving holiday in vegas with our respective families.  the original plan for thanksgiving dinner was to go to caesars' bacchanal buffet, but since we were staying at the cosmopolitan, the logistics of getting the family together there scrapped that plan a.  plan b was to go to the cosmo's wicked spoon buffet, but the three-hour plus wait resulted in us scrapping that one, too.  as a result, we made our way to scarpetta since everyone likes italian (right?) and they could accommodate our party of eight without reservations at 6:30 pm on thanksgiving day for dinner.  by this point, we were just happy that we found someplace...anyplace...for dinner.  \n\nwe were seated in a nice, small, private room looking out over the bellagio's fountains to the north.  matthew, our server, was exceedingly professional and knowledgeable about the menu, offering spot on food and drink recommendations.  we started off with drinks while we looked over the menu.  i had the billionaire ($16) made with elijah craig, pomegranate syrup, pernod absinthe, and lemon juice.  frankly, the cocktail was well made and pleasing, however, for the price, i wasn't impressed with the choice of elijah craig as the base spirit unless it was for their 18 or 20 year old stuff.  of course, since they didn't specify, i assumed it was for the standard 12 year old bourbon.  for starters, the table shared an order of <mark>Crispy Fritto Misto</mark> consisting of seafood, vegetables, artichokes, herbs & lemon ($18) and an order of <mark>Creamy Polenta</mark> topped with a fricassee of truffled mushrooms ($17).  all elements of the <mark>Crispy Fritto Misto</mark> were fried to perfection, crispy, without a hint of sogginess, leaving the mix of shrimp, calamari and octopus tender.  i like polenta.  the polenta was creamy as advertised and as good a polenta as i've ever had.  that said, it was $17 for polenta...a bit pricey.  chef scott conant and his scarpetta are known for its fresh made pastas, so for my main course, i had the pici, a thick, spaghetti-like pasta, with lobster, preserved tangerine & bottarga ($36). http://www.<mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark>.com/biz_photos/scarpetta-las-vegas?select=emj-zvy2ihq8gwdluu6ipq#qpdstngpczl7isr5mb4p5g  i'd never had pici before and it was a hearty, filling pasta.  it was tossed with restraint with what i'm assuming was only olive oil, the preserved tangerine, bottarga (a dried, pressed fish roe), and tender chunks of lobster claw meat.  the pasta dish was outstanding as the flavor profile and aromatics of each ingredient were present and in perfect balance.  while it was one seriously pricey bowl of pasta, it tasted like it was worth every bite as it hit my tongue.  the gf and i split a side of roasted mushrooms consisting of trumpet royale, beech, and shitake mushrooms, topped with pecorino and trucioleto vinegar ($11) http://www.<mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark>.com/biz_photos/scarpetta-las-vegas?select=emj-zvy2ihq8gwdluu6ipq#emj-zvy2ihq8gwdluu6ipq  it was a nice plate of fungus and excellent complement to my pasta. \n\nscarpetta may not have been our first choice for thanksgiving dinner, but it was definitely a good choice.  the food was well-executed and delivered amazing flavor.  service was attentive without any hint of intrusiveness.  the only downside was that it was quite expensive and some items seemed overpriced for what was received.  still, scarpetta is a fine restaurant and perfect for a special occasion...even thanksgiving dinner.",

            "what a giant disappointment. we saved scarpetta for our final night in vegas because it was my first choice of a new place to try. we won't ever return.\n\nwe had reservations at 6:30. we arrived at 6:24. i know this because the hostess pointed to the clock and noted that she would seat us in 6 minutes, since our reservation was for 6:30 pm. they were not busy -- no one else was waiting to be seated and only two people were sitting at the bar. we had to ask twice to check a coat, even though they have a clearly marked coat check.\n\nat this point, we just figured the hostess was inexperienced or having a rough day. once we were seated, we were promptly greeted and placed our cocktail orders. our drinks took almost 20 minutes to arrive -- although we could see there were fewer than 20 people in the entire restaurant and there were at least 5 servers standing around chatting. the rest of the night, the service remained scattered, at best. we were rushed through our first course, but had to flag down the server to order dessert. \n\non top of this, the server was constantly pushing us to \"upgrade,\" after telling us that most of the plates, as is, are pretty minimal and that most people end up having to add to them with a second round of orders. for example, i ordered the <mark>Crispy Fritto Misto</mark> salad, which runs $18. the server warned me i should order a second primi, as well. he wasn't kidding -- i got two bites of greens with a dusting of lemon and seasoning. in short, the portions are small even for an upscale, trendy restaurant.\n\nthis place has one saving grace: the tomato and basil spaghetti. i admit i'm pretty picky about italian food after i lived in italy for a summer. i understand that it's rarely as good in the states. although it's not as good as you'd get in italy, the tomato and basil spaghetti is done well here. it has a nice light sauce (it's not arrabbiata -- it's a pureed sauce), and the pasta was cooked perfectly al dente.\n\ni had the st<mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> souffle for dessert. it was adequate, although it was fairly cool by the time they got it to the table. the coffee was fine, but the server forgot the extra shot of frangelico i requested.\n\non the plus side, it's really beautiful. if you can get a seat in the windows, they overlook the bellagio fountains (unfortunately, the window seats also overlook the bellagio gardening sheds and dumpsters...so don't look down!). overall, the decor fits in well with the contemporary vibe at the cosmo. it's urban, beautifully designed, and hip. it's fresh, upscale, and open without being fussy or stuffy.\n\nas beautiful as it is and as great as that pasta plate was -- i won't be back.", 
            "i took my wife here for her 40th birthday and they knew we were coming and the reason. \n\nthis was our first time here. we arrived minutes after 9pm.\n\nthe restaurant was dimly lit. the atmosphere was loud. nothing romantic about this setting at all. \n\nhostess\n\nher greeting was like listening to an answering machine. we had a 9:30 reservation (90 min before closing) and got sat in front of a pillar. i could not see the bellagio fountains that seems to influence everybody's reviews. about 20 min later, 2 tables opened up that were right against the glass. in my reservation i let them know it was a special occasion. \n\nserver\n\nlike the hostess, it was like watching blue man group after 3 straight performances. \n\njust going through the motions. \n\nwe were not interested in cocktails or wine, but were focused on some great cuisine. the server did stop once to go over the menu, but all he did was say \"these are the apps, these are the pastas, these are the main courses\" etc. etc. they must get a lot of people who never viewed a menu before. \n\nwe ordered the misto fritto, farmers salad, fennel <mark>Black Cod</mark>, and wrapped <mark>Veal Loin</mark>. (i did not take any pictures this time, i did not want my review to be a distraction of the occasion) \n\nfood\n\nmy wife loved the complimentary bread which included dippers of olive oil, roasted eggplant and tomatoes, and truffle butter. the bread was varieties of an italian sourdough, foccacia, stromboli, and a vegetable stromboli. \n\nthey automatically split our app & salad which i appreciated. \n\nmisto fritto\n\nthe menu description was very vague, but i figured it had to be a spin off of fried calamari. tempura battered squid, white anchovies, cauliflower, and the stems of chives. there were no anchovies in my plate, and happened to be my wife's first bite on her's which she did not like at all. i would not have known about the anchovies (which i love) if i did not finish her plate. the fry was perfect, and i really liked the seasoning which included rosemary. \n\nfarmers salad\n\nthe presentation was beautiful. some of the vegetables (green & <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> squash) were almost shaved. it was a nice salad, but not much flavor. there were only 2 choices of salad on the menu and i chose this one. my wife ate only half of hers. \n\n<mark>Veal Loin</mark>\n\nthere is a picture of this dish in the archives. 3 (2oz?) wrapped pieces of veal perfectly cooked. a few pieces of carrots and another vegetable. i tasted some sort of mustard on this dish with another sauce. the menu (again) was very vague. as i ate, i was wondering what the expense was in making this dish that carried a $38 price. \n\n\n<mark>Black Cod</mark>\n\npresentation was standard, looked to be about a 5oz filet. my wife was half way through her dish without a sound. knowing my wife, this means she did not want to disappoint me in saying she did not care for it. i tried a bite and thought it was weird for cod to be so mushy. it was not pleasant at all. maybe even undercooked. \nmy wife at all the vegetables and there was half of the filet sitting alone on the plate when the busser took it away. sad that no one noticed that half of what was supposed to be the hero of this dish was being tossed out like a used tissue. \n\nwe passed on dessert because to me, dessert should be the perfect finish to a perfect meal which this whole experience was not. my wife liked the complimentary bread the best and i liked the <mark>Crispy Fritto Misto</mark> the best. there was some woman in a very loud group making noises that reminded me of farm animals in heat. \n\nit shouldn't be this way in a restaurant of this price point.   \n\ni asked for the check (1app, 1 salad, 2 entrees) $116.00 \n\nas we were getting up to leave, a person came by with a dish that said happy birthday and had 2 biscotti\"s , a cookie, a salted chocolate thingy and a lit candle.\n\nwould have went better with a cappuccino but the check was already paid. \n\nthis was a disappointing experience, even more so because i wanted it to be special for my wife's 40th. she liked the complimentary bread.....\n\nif i can say something positive and relative, i would recommend going to d.o.c g. instead. same chef, different menu. been there 5 times and loved it.", 
            "5 star! we were in vegas celebrating a bachelorette party this past weekend and i made reservations for scarpetta at cosmo.  it is one of my favorite places in la and i figured i couldn't go wrong at their las vegas location.  they exceeded expectations.  i made reservations for 7 on opentable and due to a very long taxi line at our hotel we were running a bit late, i called them and they were kind to let me know that they would seat us when we arrive and not to worry.  dinner was remarkable per usual as was the excellent service.  they were aware of our celebration and the staff made sure to congratulate our bride personally and with a desert! the waiter and his crew were extremely friendly and before we knew it 2 hrs had passed us by and we left happy and very full. i cant wait to go back!\n\nwhat we ordered:\nfarmer's market salad\n<mark>Crispy Fritto Misto</mark> \n<mark>Creamy Polenta</mark> - amazing\nroasted diver scallops\n<mark>Braised Short Ribs of Beef</mark>\nspaghetti - 4 out of 7 of us ordered this dish and all of us finished the entire bowl\nfettuccine  - if youre going to order the pasta dont be foolish order spaghetti\nprime filet <mark>Braised Short Ribs of Beef</mark> - amazing!\n\nthe drinks were also delicious! the lemon drop martini and shots especially.", 
            "great experience here! my boyfriend and i only had one night in vegas, and we wanted to go big for dinner. we chose scarpetta, and were so glad we did! our waiter was very knowledgable and helpful, and the service was great. the decor was gorgeous, and had great ambiance. i would say it was very romantic with the dim lighting and lots of dark hardwood. the view was also beautiful, and we could watch bellagio water show while we ate. \n\nnow onto the food...\n\nfirst off, we were very impressed with the complimentary bread. one of them had spinach and smoked mozzarella baked into it! we started with the <mark>Crispy Fritto Misto</mark> as an appetizer, which was great. it was delicious on it's own...no aioli needed! i had the pici for my entr\\u00e9e. tasted really great, but there was quite a bit of spice to it. it had a chili pesto sauce, so i should have expected it. it had a good amount of lobster in it. my boyfriend had the tagliatelle, and we bit decided that was the winner. the creamy truffle zabaglione sauce was to die for! the fresh vegetables and pancetta mixed in made it not overly rich as well. the pastas are made fresh there, and we could definitely taste the quality! we each had a glass of a nice pinot noir to enjoy with our pastas. \n\nit was a little pricy, but the quality is just so great and overall experience made it so worth it! there are so many great restaurants to try in vegas, but i know i will be back to scarpetta. definitely one of my top dining experiences!", 
            "oh scott!! when is the last time you did quality control??? i'm a huge fan of yours as i love the food network.  i've been itching to try out scarpetta for a while and made it a priority during my vegas trip!!\n\nomg!  everything was bad.  i mean bad!!! the service was bad and lacking and the food didn't save the day either.  let's just say i'd expected much more from you and maybe a meal at olive garden would've been a better choice. there was absolutely no seasoning in all of the dishes and the focaccia bread was drowned in oil.  the saving grace is probably your specialty bread.  \n\nwe ordered the <mark>Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti</mark> and <mark>Crispy Fritto Misto</mark> as appetizers and both were mediocre at best.  for entrees i ordered the duck and fois <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark> and omg, i couldn't eat more than 4 pieces of it and i'm known to polish my plates.  my hubby had the octopus and it was ok but lacked seasoning again.  my daughter had your world famous tomato sauce pasta and the pasta was tough and needed salt!  is it a bad day or is it normally like this?\n\nhands down the worst meal in vegas.  huge disappointment!!!"

            "5 stars for the food \n0 for the service!!!!  (and if there was anything below 0, that would be it!) \n\ni saw the famous scarpetta spaghetti on food network's \"the best thing i ever ate\" and since that episode, i have been obsessed with going to scarpetta. so excited that one opened up in beverly hills last october! however, i've been too busy to make the drive out there. \n\ni was in vegas for 1 night on april 1st and while wandering around the cosmpolitan hotel, saw scarpetta! super excited! made reservations for 8pm. arrived on time and was seated promptly. then waited, waited and waited! really, 10 minutes before our waitress even came by our table (and empty seats all around us at this time)! mind you, we had a 10pm show so i kept looking at the time... she took our drink order then returned 15 minutes later with our drinks!!! so almost 8:30 and have not even placed our order. she says she'll be \"right back\" and another 10 minutes.... ahh, if it weren't for that spaghetti, we would have walked out! so 35 minutes after we arrived, she takes our order. \n\nspaghetti for me and <mark>Braised Short Ribs of Beef</mark> for my husband. omg.. our food arrived at out table at 9:30! ate fast (because we had tickets to a show at 10). btw, the food was amazing!!!! \n\nhad to ask another waiter to find our waitress so we can get the check. she came back to our table at 9:50 (without the check of course) and i explained again we had a 10pm show (which we ended up being late for) and needed to get out of there! \n\nso the food was as good as i thought it woud be but the service (or lack of) ruined my first scarpetta experience :(", 
            "our server started us out with an array of different breads, accompanied by mascarpone butter, an eggplant tomato caponata & citrus olive oil. i often tend to judge a meal as soon as the bread (or chips... etc) arrives to the table. first impressions are crucial! if you ever dine at scarpetta, dig for the warm stromboli loaf in your bread basket first! it pairs really wonderfully with the caponata, but also stands strong on its own. you definitely want to eat this bread while its hot- because its stuffed with layers of salami & mozzarella. yum!\n\nmy first course was <mark>Braised Short Ribs of Beef</mark> over a farro risotto. the beef was immensely tender & alive with flavor. it had a very thin slice of parmesan resting on top of it, just barely melted. nice touch! i loved how hearty the risotto was- this is nothing my mom would have ever prepared for me...but somehow the risotto tasted home-y. i didn't even have time to identify all the vegetables that were in this dish, because i was far too busy stuffing my face. between bites of the short ribs, i had a few pieces of <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark>. incredibly fresh, with such great flavor. unknown to me at the time, it was adorn with almost microscopic red onions (gross)...but i ate each piece very willingly- despite my hatred for onions.\n\nfor my main course i had the <mark>Prime Aged Sirloin</mark> <mark>Braised Short Ribs of Beef</mark>. it was served with wild mushrooms, potato gnocchi & barolo ragu. everything on the plate was exceedingly juicy & robust, without being overwhelming. the gnocchi was a great equalizer to the sirloin and the ragu. this dish was really unforgettable, hats off to scott conant.\n\ndessert was very simple! <mark>Coconut Panna Cotta</mark> served with coconut sorbetto, pineapples & guava soup, ofcourse this is my pick- being a true hawaiian & all. i could have done without the crushed pineapples, i felt like they interfered with the guava coconut vibe i had going. i had mentally prepared myself for the guava soup to be too sweet, but fortunately, i was incorrect. in addition to that, i was thrilled with how smooth the <mark>Coconut Panna Cotta</mark> was. each bite was like silk!\n\nin short, i loved scarpetta. 4 stars!", 
            "great view of the bellagio fountains, romantical, ok food....\n\nlocated in the cosmo, my man took me here for my birthday, so i would love to give this place a 5.  but we both agreed for how much you're paying, the food is just ok.  service was attentive and our waiter made recommendations on the menu.  the ambiance is nice and of course if you can snag a table by the window, you'll have a lovely view of the bellagio fountains.\n\n*complimentary bread basket with three different types of dipping oil:  citrus infused olive oil, eggplant, and mascarpone butter.  would have been nice if the bread was warm.  the eggplant and mascarpone butter is soooo good.\n\n*<mark>Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti</mark>-  little tortellinis stuffed with short rib in a brown butter  horseradish sauce topped with bread crumbs.    i love short rib so i had to order this.  i could hardly see let alone taste the short rib and the dish seemed like it was drenched in horseradish, making it really strong.  i don't mind some but wow i felt like it was coming out of my nose.\n\n*ribeye <mark>Braised Short Ribs of Beef</mark>- i laugh because i don't know why my man decided to order a steak at a italian restaurant, but he was just in the mood for one.  but basically it was average, nothing wow.  stick to italian.\n\n* zepole- nutella filled donuts topped with candied hazelnuts  with a vanilla dipping sauce.  o.m.g. sooo deelish.\n\ni don't know if i\"d come back but if i did i'd try the spaghetti.  small little bowl of simple pasta for 24 bucks, but everyone keeps raving about it and even our waiter recommended it.  so it must have some kick ass sauce and noodles...", 
            "3.97 stars.\n\nafter a long day traveling to las vegas via los angeles, we were hungry and ready to celebrate our rather short weekend in sin city.  we were able to get a booth in the designated bar area that was a bit more casual than the beautiful main dinning room.  oh \"little shoe\", how pretty you are.  ambiance:  4 stars.  \n\nwe started with a few appetizers:  the beet salad (2.5 stars) that my friend said was just okay and average at best; the chestnut soup (4 stars) was actually quiet nice and sort of like a bisque with nice chunks of pickled brussel sprouts that i usually never have, but really enjoyed; and the <mark>Braised Short Ribs of Beef</mark> (3.5 stars) with fall root vegetables and faro risotto.\n\none dinner entree was the tagliatelle pasta (3.75 stars) with fall root vegetables, truffle zabaglione and guanciale (italian bacon).  this was the lighter of our three dishes and came in 3rd place.  the runner up dish was the duck & <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark> in a marsala reduction (5 stars!)  wonderfully rich and decadent, like buttah!!!  we thought the best dish was the <mark>Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti</mark> (5 stars!) of brown butter horseradish.  a stellar dish that had such an intriguing zing of fresh horseradish.  giddy up little doggie, giddy up!!\n\nservice was okay, a bit non existent initially and it took awhile to get two additional settings for our party of three; then ask for a missing bread dish.  other than that, the waiter made his italian wine recommendations that turned out to be not bad.  service:  4 stars.\n\ntally:  \nambiance:  4 stars  (\"new romantic\" 80's music, a tad bit loud)\nbeet salad:  2.5 stars\nchestnut soup:  4 stars\n<mark>Braised Short Ribs of Beef</mark>:  3.5 stars\ntagliatelle pasta:  3.75 stars\nduck & <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark>:  5 stars!\n<mark>Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti</mark>:  5 stars!\nservice:  4 stars\n4+2.5+4+3.5+3.75+5+5+4= 31.75/8= 3.97 stars.", 
            "while looking for a place to have dinner, i only needed to read 5 words to convince me to try this place out.  those five magical words were \"duck and fois <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark>.\"  umm...yes please!  so with little hesitation we called in for a reservation and i excitedly awaited dinner time.\n\nonce we arrived at scarpetta, we noticed that the decor was nice but not stuffy.  the people in the dining area seemed to be enjoying themselves and the view overlooking the bellagio fountain just added to the overall ambiance of the restaurant.  the ambiance and decor definitely work well to add to the dining experience at this restaurant.\n\nthe service was also another thing that was nice and attentive but not overly intrusive.  they were very quick to take our drink orders and were quick to come back once they noticed we were ready to order.  they also did a great job of explaining all the complimentary breads and butters as well as fielding any other question we had.  \n\nnow for the important part, the food.  here's a quick break down of what we had:\n\ncomplimentary bread:\n\nordinarily i wouldn't even mention this.  i mean, there are some restaurants that give you some phenomenally good bread but here is the thing that puts scarpetta above and beyond those other places.  the stromboli!  holy moly this thing is good.  bread baked around cheese and pepperoni (i think it was pepperoni) was just so good.  i honestly could have had this for dinner and i would've have been completely happy.\n\nappetizers:\n\n<mark>Tuna susci</mark> -   assorted marinated veggies and preserved truffles wrapped in tuna.  i suppose this was the chef's interpretation of a sushi roll but i have to say that it just fell flat.  i mean with truffle and tuna in the mix i am still scratching my head as to how this couldn't be good, but it just wasn't.  it was bland and under-seasoned.  my recommendation, don't get it.\n\nbeet salad - pretty much what you expect of a beet salad.  a great assortment of different beets with pumpkin seeds and stracciatella cheese with a balsamic dressing, it was refreshing and delicious.\n\n<mark>Braised Short Ribs of Beef</mark> - this was by far my favorite appetizer.  the short rib was succulent and delicious.  bedded on root veggies and risotto, this in a larger portion would make an amazing entree, let alone an outstanding appetizer.\n\nentree:\n\nindulge me for just a second while i d<mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> perverted metaphor.  if dinner were a porno, the bread was the nasty making out, the appetizers the foreplay, then the duck and fois <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark> would be the money shot.  goodness sakes alive this is one delicious pasta.  a nice big plate of perfectly cooked ravioli with a drizzle of marsala reduction; these decadent little bites were heaven in tiny little pockets of pasta.  if you like duck and fois gras, this is a must!\n\noverall, i had a great meal here.  i thought the prices were reasonable for vegas fine dining, the ambiance great, the service spot on, and the food was just phenomenal.  honestly, if i hadn't gotten the <mark>Tuna susci</mark> appetizer, this would have been just about the perfect meal, but even the susci couldn't dissuade me from giving scarpetta a well deserved 5 stars.  bravo!", 
            "owner scott conant (the dude from chopped) hates <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark>. therefore, i don't trust him... half kidding\n\ni think scarpetta is more like 4 stars, but i knocked off a star because our party definitely felt a little sick after eating here. maybe it was an off day (we think it's from the cheese in the potatoes of a side dish).\n\nundeniably a beautiful spot to eat. the large windows display the neighboring bellagio water fountain show, where my girlfriends and i packed into one side of the booth, so we could watch and eat at the same time.\n\noysters west coast - good, fresh <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark>. i loved the horseradish sauce that came with it, and a gravy boat of tabasco was brought to us upon request\n\nstracci - a flat noodle pasta with lobster, crab, shrimp. there were generous portions of seafood and the pasta and tasted creamy/good.\n\nduck & <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark> - i actually have to go against the hype to say that it was just okay, and not that great. the dish was a tad bit colder than luke warm, and just the richness of the foie gras/drier duck made it hard to finish the whole dish. maybe a couple bites and i was pretty much done with it :-p\n\n<mark>Black Cod</mark> - so soft and melted in my mouth (i think i ate a cloud..). \n\nribeye <mark>Braised Short Ribs of Beef</mark> 24 oz - for $62, this had better been some good ribeye. although i know that scarpetta doesn't specialize in steak, i thought it was a bit overpriced for it being standard and nothing special.  even though it was medium-rare, the steak was still a tad tough.\n\n**don't fill up on the bread** scarpetta has fantastic bread. the bread basket had 3-4 different kinds of breads, one of them being a melted roll of salami and cheese (a meal itself). and the bread came with mascarpone butter (love), eggplant dip, and olive oil\n\none of the better restaurants in the cosmo. did anybody realize the restaurants in the city center area (cosmopolitan, vdara, aria) are not that great? hmmm", 
            "came here for a girl's weekend out. what a great experience! \nscarpetta is located on the third floor of the cosmopolitan hotel. it's quite swanky, so you will want to dress up so you don't stick out like a sore thumb. the ambience is classy /sophisticated. the lighting is a bit dark, but that's why this is a great set up for looking out the window at night to see the bellagio water show. it's a great place to take a date or to just have a \"let's get dressed up cuz we can\" night out with the girls.\nwe had a reservation, so we were seated immediately. may i just mention that the service here is magnificent. there was just the three of us, but they still sat us in a huge booth that can easily sit 6 people. it's a circular booth, so i was a little apprehensive about scooting with my little black dress on. without saying a word, our host slid the whole table out, so that we can walk to our seats instead of scooting. from then, they had already won me over =).\n ok, let's get to the food shall we? we started with the \"<mark>Braised Short Ribs of Beef</mark>\" which is placed over root vegetables and risotto. delish. the short rib was soft and delicate and melt in your mouth deliciousness. not over seasoned at all. there are four small pieces, but each bite is delightful. the other appetizer that we decided to share was the \"roasted sea scallops\" which is served over cauliflower, bottarge, cili and caper sauce. aaaaaaaaaa-mazing. if i wasn't so nice, i would've eaten both pieces instead of share it. ;-)\nthe complimentary bread came with three spreads - butter, eggplant, and olive oil. all three tasted great and the different types of bread were warm and soft and all kinds of good =p. and since i love bread... this just won me over even more.\nso since this is an italian restaurant and the chef became famous because of his spaghetti, we all decided to order pasta. we ordered \"duck and <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark>\", \"spaghetti,\" and \"stracci\"... all of which were heavenly. the ravioli was soft, but not mushy and filled with such great flavor that my friend, who was already really full midway, ate the whole entire dish. spaghetti - you think it's just regular good ol' spaghetti... not at all. the pasta was cooked perfectly and the seasoning was on point. not too salty, not too sweet. perfect. my dish was the stracci - flat pieces of hand made noodles with lobster, crab, shrimp, and basil breadcrumbs. if you're mouth has not watered just reading that - something is seriously wrong with you. this is probably my most favorite pasta dish. they did not skimp on the blue crabs (i at least believe it's blue crabs, though, i can't be entirely sure), the lobster mean, and the shrimp. i wanted to save room for dessert, but i just couldn't stop stuffing myself with this dish. i loved that the flat noodles didn't stick to each other and it was soft and just really well made. i loved loved loved it!\ni wish i could tell you we ordered dessert. but the three of us were just so full that we decided to opt out of the dessert. though all of them sounded amazing.\nin any case, i rarely give out 5's. for me, something has to stick out. in this case, though the food was extraordinary, the service and the view puts it over my usual 4 stars into  a 5 star <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> review.\nbottom line: i would definitely come here again.. so there's not reason why you shouldn't try it out =)", 
            "very attentive staff, gorgeous decor (albeit a bit dark), quality food:\n\nbraised short ribs with spring vegetables and farro rissoto: fall-off the bone tender, perfectly seasoned, and i enjoyed the twist on the rissoto\n\nroasted sea scallops: cooked to perfection, not too briny or rubbery, to go very well with the white truffle asparagus, not too overwhelmed by the rich truffle oil.\n\nduck and <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark>: delicious, but too decadent for my taste. they give you a huge portion, too, about 3 times the amount i actually was expecting, even for an entree. filling, with a good salty bite. finishing this was the death of me, but a very enjoyable self-indulgent death.\n\nspaghetti: i love when simple, basic dishes are just beautifully executed. this was just the perfect spaghetti. i would be perfectly okay walking into a restaurant like this and ordering it. it is divine.\n\nmediterranean branzino: seafood party in my mouth. branzino had a nice caramelized crust and the medley of vegetables and shrimp/clams/etc paired really well with the light broth.\n\n<mark>Prime Aged Sirloin</mark> <mark>Braised Short Ribs of Beef</mark>: cooked to bloody medium-rare excellence. enjoyed the salty/nutty bite of parmagiano.\n\nas for cocktails, i can recommend the gimlet and the gallardo.", 
            "i have been here twice and will come back again, willing to try the one in beverly hills as well. so i made reservations here this weekend knowing that my friends would enjoy the ambiance and food. was a success, they kept thanking me for bringing them. \n\nthis time i tried the <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark>, it did not disappoint. i also recommend the mushroom polenta soup, very rich in flavor. the <mark>Spiced Duck Breast</mark> and veal chop which i had last time were amazing so i wanted to try other dishes. i shared food with some of my friends which is an excellent way to try multiple items, we don't mind, sharing is caring. the lamb my friend ordered medium was very good, although i would have ordered it medium rare it would <mark>Braised Short Ribs of Beef</mark> better. \n\nas far as the service goes, they we're very attentive to filling our waters and replacing our drinks. when we paid, i gave the waiter a coupon which they emailed me for 15% off the entire meal, no problem. one of the waiters also helped me put on my jacket, very courteous. every detail counts!", 
            "love this place!  went her for my girlfriend's birthday and was delicious!  i had their <mark>Prime Aged Sirloin</mark> <mark>Braised Short Ribs of Beef</mark> rare as possible for $36 and the spaghetti tomatoes with basil is to die for here.  service and atmosphere was perfect.\n\ncan't want to go here again. =d", 
            "my friend had tried the scarpetta in la and had raved about it, so when she came to town we had to try the one at the cosmopolitan hotel. she was absolutely right (she usually is ;) and i have been back several times since first trying it with her. \n\nthe restaurant is beautifully done .. very contemporary and chic .. and most every seat boasts a fabulous view of the bellagio fountain show. it's a great place for entertaining out-of-town guests for sure. one time we even had the privilege of being seated at the \"chefs\" table (which is in a private room) with a prime view of the fountain show and the entire kitchen. \n\nthe food .. what can i say .. everything we've tried there is spectacular! my favorites are the <mark>Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti</mark>, which is simply melt-in-your mouth goodness and the tagliatelle with fall vegetables, truffle zabagalione & guanciale, which is just the right amount of truffle and is nice and light. i've also tried that famous spaghetti .. it's good, very good, but not something that i would order again. some of my dining partners have tried the lobster pasta, the <mark>Black Cod</mark> and the <mark>Spiced Duck Breast</mark> and the little bites i tried were good, but not necessarily items i would order. \n\nfrom the starters, my favorites are the <mark>Creamy Polenta</mark>, again with truffle :) and the <mark>Braised Short Ribs of Beef</mark>. the calamari and the scallops are also good, but we keep going back to the polenta. \n\ndessert .. the most important part of the meal .. the second time we were there, we saw something at another table that looked delicious and right up our alley .. turns out it was not on their menu but from the neighboring scott conant eatery docg enoteca. it's called the salted caramel budino with pretzel toffee.  it is super creamy and  the perfect balance of both sweet and salty at the same time. we shared it the first go-around but now order one each whenever we go .. and that rarely happens. \n\nthe service is impeccable, friendly knowledgeable servers and bussers who go the extra mile and have great personalities. the first time we were there my dining partner mentioned she was heading to dc the following weekend and our server came back with a list of fun things / places for her to do while she was there.", 
            "i went to this restaurant just to try the spaghetti with tomatoes & basil as seen on the food network.  unbelievable!  also, can't forget the <mark>Braised Short Ribs of Beef</mark> short ribs with polenta & truffled mushrooms.  so many choices in vegas but this is one to check out.  wine prices are a bit on the high side.", 
            "surprised my boyfriend with dinner here this past saturday for his birthday. we made reservations for 7:30 and requested a table by the window. we were 5 minutes late because we had to stop by the atm which, by the way, is located right at the foot of the escalator by security. we were greeted by the hostesses and manager who were all friendly. the dining room itself was a lot smaller than i had expected. they were able to accommodate our request and we were seated at a beautiful 2 top with a perfect view of the bellagio fountains. water glasses were immediately filled and a bread basket magically appeared with 3 accompaniments: citrus infused olive oil, eggplant spread and my fav, mascarpone cheese... way better than boring butter! like everyone has already mentioned the bread basket was delish! we also got a bottle of red wine for a great price, $75. we shared everything and for some of the dishes they were actually able to split it in 2 so it would be easier to share! this was my first time tasting fresh pasta and you can most certainly taste a difference. there's a specific bite and texture that can't be compared to that dry stuff at the grocery... \n\n-<mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> tail: 4 very fresh pieces!!! love the salt sprinkled on it. and the pieces were actually pretty thick and not some skimpy thin little things.\n-<mark>Creamy Polenta</mark> with truffled mushrooms: perfect balance of creamy and sweet. i liked it because it was more like a soup for me haha\n-braised short ribs with risotto: tender chunks <mark>Braised Short Ribs of Beef</mark>. tasted like this korean short rib dish that i love. \n-duck & <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark>: my favorite dish of the night. it was so decadent and delicious. if you don't like the taste of strong cheese, you will not like this dish. the sweet marsala sauce paired perfect with it.\n-spaghetti: i'm sure some people have a problem spending $25 on a small plate of spaghetti but it definitely is something everyone should taste at least once. light, fresh sauce with perfectly aldente pasta... it is because of this dish alone my boyfriend had been wanting to come to scarpetta. he has made this recipe a couple times for me and i'm sorry to say but my boyfriend's spaghetti tastes exactly the same.. if not better. but then again my opinion may be biased haha\n-ny strip steak: it was a mistake ordering this because we were so full. we had to force ourselves to finish this dish haha at $55 though i didn't think the steak was that amazing.. it actually had some unwanted gristle on it. but i'm sure it would have tasted a lot better had we not been so full. \n\ni really wanted to get dessert for him and they were going to do something special for us but we were already so late for our show and not to mention so beyond stuffed.. we had to run out of there... literally, we ran out of there! \n\nservice was amazing all night from our server all the way down to the lady who came around with parmesan cheese and chili flakes. but special shout-out to paul k...the friendly food runner/expo who was so polite and quite knowledgeable about all of the food. \n\nthanks scarpetta! \nscott conant, you are hot \n;ppp", 
            "as much as i am critical regarding the outlandish folly that which is the strip, there are, in my opinion, a few exceptional culinary experiences that you can only get here and nowhere else; with breathtaking, majestic feats of visionary engineering, the strip personifies man's ability to create way beyond his present environment and envision a future filled with unlimited possibilities.  and when a night on the town includes that man-made wonderland, you get magic, an 'umami' of all the senses.\n\nscarpetta by chef scott conant encompasses that dining experience, and out of all his venues bearing the same name, i enjoy the vegas restaurant by far.  although all the restaurants are elegant with great food, this restaurant takes the vegas experience and showcases style with understated design gestures.  'scarpetta' means little shoe in italian, a reference to the menu's 'soulfulness'...  guess my mind wandered to other references...like, the foot fetish variety - shrimping anyone?  no? too far?\n\nthe design is deceptively tame; meaning that it's not drenched in the typical vegas gaudy, interior so-five-seconds ago gimmicks that cause visual norovirus.  but once you situate and settle down, you notice the lyrical design flow lending itself to a relaxing, calming evening. by then the fountains at the bellagio will have sprung into full effect, with sweeping side views of the lake and the beautiful architecture as a backdrop for the dynamic geysers bursts - a stunning piece of visual entertainment lasting the night.\n\nafter dining at scarpetta on numerous occasions, i've come to the conclusion that although everything on the menu is good, i naturally gravitate towards the pasta section of the menu.  i enjoy all of the home made pastas and the balance with the ingredients that chef conant pairs with them.  and to be honest, i'm just tired of entrees, they've become burdensome, overpriced and unusually large with the same old formula: big ass protein with some creamy mush underneath it with a side of blah..yawn.  if anything, i'd get some apps, but i've eaten most of them on the menu; i do recommend the <mark>Creamy Polenta</mark> + fricassee of truffled mushrooms, the heirloom beet salad and the <mark>Braised Short Ribs of Beef</mark>. (they push the <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> as their signature classic- really...if i wanted sashimi, i'd go eat at a japanese restaurant where it's served pure, you really don't need any heavy onions or olive oil or jalape\\u00f1os to mask the flavor of this delicious protein.....truth).  \n\nspaghetti + tomato +basil: an all time favorite of mine, this dish is as simple as it can get (it's up there with spaghetti all' aglio olio e pepperoncino) but so fresh and light with just a few ingredients, the pasta shines through as the main character which, being the carb addict that i am, is harmonious!  it's presented as the first dish, based on its levity and absence of protein.  \n\nricotta + truffle agnolotti: the second dish in the fete de pasta is a deep contrast to the acidity of the prior dish, the fluffy pillows filled with ricotta and covered in a light truffle cream sauce.  i love using the term 'pillows', it describes these soft chewy bite size packages of pasta like a metaphoric squishy rest to the head; that, \"ahhh\" moment when your cranium sinks into a downy cloud.....i love sleep..  the creamy truffle white sauce has just enough weight to coat your palate without any buyer's remorse and the quantity is perfect for two.\n\nblack tonarelli + king crab + coddled egg + smoked trout roe: i'm always excited when i see squid ink pasta on any menu - i relish the slightly briny noodle that goes well with all seafood toppings.  with this dish, it's even more decadent with the introduction of the coddled egg, coating every strand with a sticky liquid goo. it's such oral satisfaction.  oh, and there's crab, you really can't go wrong when there's crab.  \n\npici + lobster +preserved tangerine + bottarga: pici is thick cut pasta, a fat spaghetti, akin to udon.  it is hearty and appropriately the last pasta course of the evening.  the pici is paired with lobster, preserved tangerine and bottarga, a cured fish roe.  the bottarga amps up the salty briny element while the the juicy lobster gives a sweet delicate flavor - all the ingredients manage to balance out with the pasta.\n\ncaramella milk chocolate mousse + saut\\u00e9ed <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> peaches + praline crunch + pistachio bastoni: okay, this was a bit of a surprise-under our waiter guidance, we ordered this dessert for the first time... this plate of what can only be described as a kindergarden art project with chocolate squares and pistachio logs....  i wonder if the chefs are so bored that they need to play with the food and at the same time give us less.  and in the end, it didn't really have much flavor as compact as it was- it was like a plate of mignardises that usually come with a post-meal hot beverage.\n\nratings (out of five stars)\nfood:            4.75\nambience:    4.75\nservice:         4.5", 
            "was here this past year for ces, and we had 2 events here.\none was our company dinner in the private room with a view of bellagio fountains and the other was a upper management meeting with a client over wine tasting in the private seating area which is in the kitchen.\n\nfor the wine tasting, it was pretty awesome, except the room is probably equipped to seat 8 people comfortably, maybe 10, we squeezed in 12.  we enjoyed some awesome wines and some desserts, which hey mistakenly sent to our table, so they ended up comping those and bringing more, it was very good.  \n\nthe cool thing about this private room, is that you have to walk through the kitchen to get to it and it is located next to the kitchen, with glass floor to ceiling so you can see into the kitchen as they work and cook and the background is a view of the bellagio fountains and the strip.  \n\nthe second occasion was for our company dinner a few nights later since they were able to accommodate our group of 16 in the private dining room that is in front of the restaurant and our big boss loves italian food.  \n\nalthough you can order single entrees off the menu, we had our waiter set up our dinner family style with some of his recommendations and some of the things we wanted to try.  \n\nalso, our big boss had a request for something off the menu and the chef obliged with no problems.  keeping the boss happy is always key!\n\nwe had the following dishes.\napps - braised short rib <mark>Braised Short Ribs of Beef</mark>, <mark>Creamy Polenta</mark>, <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> and <mark>Tuna susci</mark>\nthe short ribs and the polenta were my favorite, the susci was just ok.\n\nentrees - duck and <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark>, <mark>Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti</mark>, sheep milk ricotta agnolotti.  all were awesome, but the duck and <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark> is very rich.\n\nwe had dessert, but i don't actually remember what i had.\n\nservice was great and except the bar was slow, so they comped certain drinks that didn't show up in a time fashion.\n\nthe minus one star was for the sommelier, who seemed to enjoy the sound of his own voice and didn't really consider the requests of the guests at the table.  i understand he is very knowledgeable and he is an expert, but he could dial back the ego and work with the guest.  \n\nother than that, great place, i recommend it and you will not be disappointed.",

            "damn this was such a good meal!  my friends and i dined here for restaurant week 2013 and all of us, but one, ordered off the restaurant week menu.  it all began when i made reservations on open table, courtesy of the <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> app on my iphone.  i didnt have any preference of where we sat, but where the hostess sat us was remarkable!  we got a window seat facing the bellagio, so not only did we enjoy a delicious meal, we also got to enjoy a fantastic view of the strip, the bellagio, and also the bellagio fountain show all at once!  now this was a meal to remember!  service was top notch, there were no disappointments there; the waiter we had was very attentive and helpful in helping us make our selection from the menu.  \n\ncourse 1: <mark>Braised Short Ribs of Beef</mark> short rib - very tender pieces of sliced beef on top of what they called a risotto (not the traditional type of risotto) but it was still delicious!  the \"risotto\" was basically diced pieces of vegetables which supported the 3-4 pieces <mark>Braised Short Ribs of Beef</mark> on top.  very good combination of flavors and textures.  very impressed.  \n\nbefore the second course came, we were all scarfing down their stromboli bread which is complimentary with our meal!  it came with other bread, which were not that memorable.  the bread was also served with three types of spreads, an eggplant marinara spread, olive oil, and something else i cannot remember. on a side note, one of my friends even asked the waiter to bring an entire basket filled with the bread, which he did!  that made her evening! haha.  \n\ncourse 2: jidori chicken - now i didn't know what a jidori chicken was, so i asked the waiter.  this whole time, i thought it was the way the chicken was cooked!  but instead, it is the type of chicken used to make the chicken, like using kurabuta pork.  i can definitely tell the difference with kurabuta pork and regular pork, but this jidori chicken was a bit more difficult to tell the difference from regular chicken, besides the fact that this chicken was moist throughout!  maybe that's what makes jidori chicken so good?  well, next time i will know! =d  \n\nnot only did i have the second course as my main meal, i had to try their handmade spaghetti everyone raves about!  so i ordered a dish for everyone to share!  in conclusion, it was pretty damn good.  what makes it good is the noodles!  the texture is not too over or undercooked, but just right!  i guess the handmade pasta really makes a difference in a pasta dish!  \n\ncourse 3: <mark>Chocolate Cake</mark> with salted caramel ice cream - now how can you end a meal without dessert!?  my stomach was so distended prior to the second course, but i had to taste everything!  by the time dessert came, i swear i have a second stomach!  i devoured not only my dessert, but my friends dessert too!  she ordered the stuffed donuts with nutella....what?! nutella in fried dough?  yes!  nuff said. ;-)  \n\ni'd definitely come back to scarpetta again!  quite pricey for a student like myself, so probably come again with my family, during restaurant week, or when i start making the big bucks!",

            "absolutely amazing! a must try! great food! \n\nmy boyfriend and i had previously tried this restaurant. we had such a great experience the first time, so when he asked me \"where do you want to go for your birthday dinner?\" i quickly responded.... \"scarpetta!\" \nwhen we went for my birthday, it was such a lovely experience.  our waiter was just amazing! he was so personable, and really made the overall experience pleasant! a great celebration!\n\nfor our food, we started with the roasted diver scallops, which just melted in your mouth, we then had the spaghetti, which is undeniably a must try item, the pasta is cooked to perfection and the taste is just simply amazing, after the spaghetti we then had the prime ny strip <mark>Braised Short Ribs of Beef</mark>, the meat was cooked perfectly!  and to top it all off, i had to order the mascarpone cheesecake.... after all- it was my birthday! this cheesecake was absolutely delicious, and topped with a magical mango pineapple compote and passion fruit! so yummy!\n\nthis is a restaurant that you must try!  \n\n-ask for a table by the window when making your reservation, there is a beautiful view of the bellagio fountain to enjoy!\n\n(sorry for the delay in my review/post- my birthday celebration dinner was back in april, and i have recommended this place to many people that i have met and know, and  i figured i finally need to put my great opinion out there to share!)", 
            "excellent dining experience!!! our waiter was very knowledgable and attentive to our requests and needs! \nwe had fettuccine  with lamb ragu, broccoli rabe & pecorino to start with .... it was very good\n main course: prime filet <mark>Braised Short Ribs of Beef</mark> with potato-lardo pur\\u00e9e, rainbow chard & barolo sauce and <mark>Spiced Duck Breast</mark> with eggplant gratin, pine nuts & duck jus!\n both were very tasty and balanced in flavors!\nfor dessert we had  nutella & vanilla bomboloni (nutella ganache, banana gelato & chocolate shortbread)....... interesting ........ didn't impress me much as i was looking for more uniqueness !!!! it  reminded me of donut fi\n\nfor drinks we had:\nil dolce limone  and san remo!!!\n\nif you are looking for a romantic dinner with you loved one, this is a very good choice!!!!", 
            "i have dreamt about eating the spaghetti here for years. for years. and when that spaghetti and i finally met and dined together, it did not disappoint. the spaghetti noodles are cooked to an al dente. rather than the spaghetti sauce poured on top, the noodles are simmered and cooked with simple sauce. the starch from the noodles holds onto the flavors bringing together the noodles and sauce. the spaghetti here is divine.\n\nin addition to the spaghetti, our table also shared the <mark>Creamy Polenta</mark> with truffled mushrooms, the <mark>Braised Short Ribs of Beef</mark>, and the <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark>. all of which were equally as good.\n\nthe service was subpar. our table had to constantly flag our waiter down. for a fine dining establishment, i felt like we were jipped. on top of the inattentiveness, my friend encountered a shard of plastic/glass in her salad. lemme tell you, whatever she bit into was hard. hard. everyone at the table felt it and indeed, the shard was tough and hard. we sent the dish back to the kitchen and the chef simply said that we were mistaken and that shard was actually just a piece of hard sea salt....uh. okay. clearly that piece of salt sea did not melt in my friend's mouth and it was hard. sea salt my ass.\n\nthe food is good, but go to the one in beverly hills. this place sucks. and maybe they cater toward out of towners who don't know any better, but for the vast majority- we know what fine dining should look and feel like and this certainly is not it.", 
            "if you want a lot of pompous attitude, and pay a lot for average food this is the place for you.  don't order the <mark>Braised Short Ribs of Beef</mark> rib.  you will leave hungry and who puts cheese on their ribs.  that's a shame.  don't expect to eat healthy either.  the cocktails were very good though, so i would recommend the bar.  the restaurant also has an amazing view.", 
            "wow...yummy!\n\ni had wanted to try out scarpetta having been a huge chopped fan and knowing i was going to be staying next-door in the bellagio. opentable didn't have a reservation available for that day and i thought i was out of luck. we happen to be at the cosmopolitan anyways and went upstairs to do a drop in... luckily they had a table for two with a fountain view and all!\n\ni can't say enough good things about the breadbasket it was amazing. the caponata i could've eaten 10 bowls. \n\nbut i wisely left some room for apps and the main. i had the beet and burrata salad. the dressing on the beets was tangy and the burrata very rich and smooth. it was also beautifully composed. my companion had the polenta. which was just as sinfully creamy as they said it would be.\n\nfor main i had the <mark>Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti</mark>. rich little pillows <mark>Braised Short Ribs of Beef</mark> heaven. and the breadcrumb crunch on top...perfect. and of course we had to try the famous spaghetti. there's a reason they're famous for it. sauce clings to the noodles and transports you to italy...get it.", 
            "solid. never knew how \"gourmet\" pasta could get, but yes it surely can to that level. believe it. \n\nentrees:\n<mark>Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti</mark>: this dish was perfection. the little ravioli-like pieces were well stuffed with flavorful short rib and the toasted breadcrumbs were the perfect topper. totally recommended.\nduck & <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark>: the richness of the filling makes it a dish to remember. c'mon it's foie gras! may be too fatty/heavy for one, but a delectable dish to share. \nspaghetti: took a bite of my friend's. pretty damn good for a traditional spaghetti dish, but it's really not like your mama's spaghetti at all. them al dente noodles were on point. \nchicken: chicken is just chicken, to me. wasn't particularly exciting.\nprime filet <mark>Braised Short Ribs of Beef</mark>: this was another item for our table. pieces of steak were cooked med-rare, which made the pieces juicy. good, but not \"steak-house good.\"\n\nthe desserts were shared were the grapefruit <mark>Coconut Panna Cotta</mark> and bombolini. both were so delicious! i'm typically hesitant about ordering fancy dessert, but these were worth it! \n\nin addition, we got the perfect view of the bellagio water show from our table. and to top it all off, our server (a mid-aged asian man) was incredible hospitable, genuine in his recommendations and considerate of our party's needs. the service really made it a great experience for our bachelorette's dinner. \n\nscarpetta, thanks for making our vegas trip a classy one.", 
            "a few years may have passed, but scarpetta is just as outstanding as ever.\n\ni dropped by on a friday night, immediately after a show at the chelsea had let out.  thousands of people were descending on cosmo's p3 restaurant zone all at once, and i had to select a dinner spot as quickly as possible, or else no open seats would be left.  scarpetta was the ideal choice, since i could squeeze in at the bar.\n\nthe place was a madhouse, but i didn't mind.  service at the bar was just as spot-on as in the dining room.  i was also luckily enough to be seated next to some very friendly and sociable solo diners who *love* talking about food.\n\ni started off with a glass of riesling, which i sipped while nibbling on some freshly baked bread.  scarpetta serves one of the finest breadbaskets in vegas, with abundant olive oil, eggplant tapanade, and whipped mascarpone cheese for spreading.\n\nfor my app, i tried the <mark>Braised Short Ribs of Beef</mark> short rib with farro risotto and a slice of lardo.  ladies and gentlemen -- you will never taste short rib as tender and delicate as this.  absolutely perfect.\n\nfor my entree, i tried the spaghetti, which is apparently a specialty of the house -- and i can totally see why.  thick, plump noodles with a smooth and flavorful sauce will totally upend any preconceived notions of what spaghetti should taste like.  you think spaghetti is simple or boring?  not after scott conant has his way with it.  \n\nthere are so many fabulous restaurants in the cosmo that picking a single favorite is close to impossible...but scarpetta is definitely high on the list!", 
            "came here for a romantic anniversary dinner after seeing great reviews by other <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> and we were definitely steered in the right direction. \nwe had made reservation a week in advance and were hoping to get a table with a view of the bellagio fountains, though they told us they can't promise and that we will have to try our luck when we arrive. we made it to our reservation on time, yet we still had to wait 20 minutes, which was alittle annoying considering we had made reservations. though we didn't get a fountain view, we were too hungry at that point to care. \nour server immediately bought out a bread basket with a trio of olive oil, eggplant and honey butter. the bread was incredible!!! my favorite was the salami and cheese filled one (i still dream about it). for appettizer we got the mediterraen octopus, which was cooked just perfectly! for our entrees we got prime filet <mark>Braised Short Ribs of Beef</mark> and ravioli foie gras and duck. though the ravioli was underwhelming, there was lot of ravioli squares which really was great. the filet <mark>Braised Short Ribs of Beef</mark>, on the other hand, was absolutely amazing. it was perfectly cooked and the softest beef i've ever had in my life. this really was the greatest dish i've ever eaten in my life and i was beyond impressed. \nfor dessert, we had mentioned that it was our anniversary and were given a <mark>Chocolate Cake</mark> with happy anniversary writing, which was a lovely surprise. sadly,. the cake was very dry but the ice-cream helped. \nin all i would highly recommend scarpetta and would love to come back here for our next vegas trip!!", 
            "from the outside, it just looks like a regular restaurant with a bar in the front. but as you make your way, the places says fancy all around. i went here with a bachelorette group and it was a nice flashy restaurant to celebrate such an occasion.\n\nthe service was great, however, it did take some time for the server to get to us. they were hospitable and made sure everything was set in order for you. their selection looked great. the dish i chose was $45 (prime beef whatever lol i'm not sure what the dish was called). it was tasty but small. i will admit, i like to enjoy my food but i do want some quantity in it as well. for that $45, i would be able to get a bigger piece <mark>Braised Short Ribs of Beef</mark> elsewhere, however, it wouldn't have been cooked by the famous chef and that restaurant. sadly, i do not ever no who that is. haha! nonetheless, the beef was amazing and tasted great. the side potatoes and mushrooms added flavor to the beef and mixed well.\n\nwhen it comes to the drinks, i advise you just get it elsewhere. small martinis or little drinks were $15+ and when it came to wine, just be careful with your wallet! some bottles are worth over $1500! and that's wine that was bottled in 2002-2005! just go to the nearest store and enjoy that stella rosa!", 
            "the best part of the meal was the bread basket, it was seriously the best bread i've ever had. we had the polenta and short rib appetizers and both were amazing. the short rib and bone morrow agnolotti with a brown butter sauce was excellent as was the <mark>Spiced Duck Breast</mark>. the pici noodles were perfect and perfectly spiced. the flavors were wonderful. the prime filet <mark>Braised Short Ribs of Beef</mark> was ok. we were all stuffed but we had to have the bomboloni and <mark>Chocolate Cake</mark>, yum!"

            "great good, great feel, great service.\n\nour evening at scarpetta was a late one, with dinner reservations at 9:30, i was expecting a rushed and lackluster performance. however, my prediction was soon proven wrong.\n\nwe arrived and were seated immediately in a comfy booth facing the windows. our server quickly came to our table with bottled water and began to introduce himself and the restaurant to us. his delivery was smooth and made us feel welcome.\n\nhe took our wine orders, brought out the vino and listed off the specialties of the house for the evening. soon after departing, a waiter came to our table and delivered the first batch of goodies. a basket of treats with artisan baked focaccia, bread with salami and oozing cheese baked right in and a selection of dipping sauces. we quickly devoured one of each and were in carb heaven.\n\nwhen our waiter returned we put in our main course order of their famous spaghetti and the <mark>Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti</mark>. he refilled our wine shortly thereafter and let us enjoy some conversation and spectating.  this place was buzzing at 10pm with eye candy and low-lit cool vibes.\n\nfinally, our main courses arrived. the spaghetti is unforgettable with thick noodles, creamy reduced marinara and a touch of fresh basic. the <mark>Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti</mark>, the little perfectly packaged pockets of braise short rib and hint of horseradish bursted with slow cooked flavor.\n\noverall, the staff, food and ambiance was something i won't soon forget next time i am in town.", 
            "as guest we felt like a burden instead of welcomed and we found the foods  we tried as one dimensional and under seasoned , flat and the dessert awful . maybe they just weren't in the working flow of things yet or maybe it just was an off night i don't know.\n\nthe door was wide open at 5:25 so we walked in and the hostess told us to make a reservation for 5:30 and to leave and come back in a few minutes . we thought that seemed odd but thought it was just because she was very young and figured that was all it was and came back a few minutes latter .\n\ntoo start with i received a white lint filled napkin on top of my black pants , but i did notice they have black linen napkins they use for the wine bottles. \n\nwe felt uncomfortable the whole time dining because most of the time i saw up to eleven members of staff were standing across from us with their backs against the wall just looking out into our direction . i glared at them a few times but they didn't budge .\n\nwe started with the <mark>Tuna susci</mark> -described as marinated vegetables with preserved truffles , everything was <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> everything had little taste.\n\nwe shared the <mark>Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti</mark> , that were like mini raviolis filled with short rib that had a baby food texture inside the well made pasta. maybe ten percent of the  agnolottis we topped with a scant amount of toasted  crumbs slightly laced with horseradish for flavor that were resting in some browned butter.\n\nthe <mark>Black Cod</mark> although cooked nicely would have been forgettable but was not , only because of the concentrated tomato that i found interesting .  this dish was extremely mild and under seasoned with a few pieces of fennel that were nicely caramelized .\n\nmy husband had the <mark>Spiced Duck Breast</mark> and he said it was his least favorite one he ever had since the skin wasn't crispy and also lacked flavor , he thought it wasn't seasoned at all .\n\nwe had a little time to kill before the show so we thought maybe dessert might be good . we ordered the zeppole i don't mean to be mean or disrespectful but honest to god they tasted just like the chocolate muffins of the sweet tomatoes salad bar buffet , the zeppole were bread like , not sweet , almost not chocolate flavored and only a few zeppole not all had essence of nutella in them . \n\nat this price range they don't have this much room for error.", 
            "what a memorable night it was! first, i definitely would request a window view of the bellagio water show if you can, because my boyfriend and i saw three shows while enjoying our dinner. scarpetta's very romantic but is also just a great place for a one-of-a-kind italian meal. \n\nwe started out with sharing a glass of pinot noir, which was delicious and smooth. for an appetizer, i highly recommend the <mark>Creamy Polenta</mark> with truffled mushrooms...then you must dip the bread they give you into the mushroom mixture. deliciouso! i ordered the simple, but unforgettable tomato and basil spaghetti and my boyfriend ordered the <mark>Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti</mark>, which he devoured. all their pasta is made fresh at the restaurant and can't be compared to any other pasta i've had. you must try it for yourself!\n\nreservations can be made online, and i definitely recommend this to anyone who is visiting las vegas with their significant other or wants to make a good first impression :)", 
            "great service, but the food was far below our expectations. \n\nthe bread basket was great, my personal favorite was the salami infused slices. as far as the meals go, my date ordered the the <mark>Creamy Polenta</mark> as her appetizer and she seemed to enjoy it. \n\ni opted for the <mark>Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti</mark> as my main dish and the pasta was loaded with <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> horseradish which flat out overpowered the whole dish with almost every bite. and i love spicy food, but it would took my breath away with almost every bite, so it was far too much for my liking. you would have to absolutely love horseradish to even enjoy this dish. \n\nmy date ordered the risotto with vegetables from the vegetarian menu which was just mixed diced vegetables. the dish came out at room temperature and did not taste good at all, so the order was sent back.\n\ni will not be returning to scarpetta, nor will i ever recommend it to anyone i know.", 
            "i wanted to love scarpetta, i really did. i was still mesmerized by the striking view i got to take in during the grand opening and determined to prove all of the reviews about the mediocre service wrong, but our waiter left me no choice but to report otherwise.\n\ni want to point out the highlights before i rip scarpetta to shreds. i came in for restaurant week so got the pre-fixe menu and chose the <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark>, <mark>Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti</mark>, and <mark>Coconut Panna Cotta</mark>. i thought the <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> had great flavor and was presented beautifully. my only complaint was that it seemed to be served a little on the warm side to me which is a concern when it comes to <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark>.\n\nthe <mark>Coconut Panna Cotta</mark>/guava soup was not only delicious but beautiful too. the almost tart soup was a nice contrast to the creamy <mark>Coconut Panna Cotta</mark>-probably the best <mark>Coconut Panna Cotta</mark> i've ever had! not too rich or too sweet, and again, perfectly balanced with the cold fruit soup. i usually don't go for dessert soups, but i'd probably come back just for that.\n\nthe view is killer-great front row seats to the bellagio water show!\n\nnow for the bad.\n\nstrike one: maybe this is just me being very nitpicky, but the presentation of the <mark>Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti</mark> was just gross. the pasta was served in a wide, shallow bowl and the appearance of pasta in one thin layer with hardly any garnish (save the breadcrumbs which had a nice flavor) was just unappetizing. also, the pasta was incredibly greasy. i've had pasta in brown butter sauce before that didn't look like that. the filling was good, very rich and flavorful, but the sauce was just off-putting. \n\nstrike two: for the duration of our dinner, a toddler continuously screamed at the top of his lungs, banged on the table, stood on the booth in which his family was sitting and annoyed the crap out of the surrounding diners. as a fine dining restaurant, it's your responsibility to make sure that the experience is just that, fine dining. which means if you need to tell this family who cannot control their spoiled infant to beat it, in the interest of preserving the experience for surrounding diners, then do it. after an hour of embarrassing behavior and ugly stares from other tables, the dad who was elegantly dressed in board shorts, shower shoes and a baseball cap removed the child from the fine dining situation. i feel like the management should've handled this earlier, but god forbid they offend one person who is offending the entire restaurant. \n\nstrike three: our waiter was a dud. i get it, everyone has their off days, but i think this waiter's life was a series of off days. i'm hoping that his service standards weren't lowered because we were getting what was essentially a discounted menu, but i can't help that think this was the case. discounted menu=less tip? not always. but if your behavior warrants a tip to match the discounted bill then that's what you'll get. it took about 15 minutes for bread to come out and for the waiter to bring water. then another 15 minutes for him to take our order for wine. and about another 20 minutes to take our food order. i shouldn't have to flag you down and tell you we're ready to order. that's not my job as a patron of the restaurant. i wasn't in any rush, but those lapses in time mean either this dude was just straight up inattentive or suffering the early stages of dementia. everything about the dinner just dragged on unnecessarily. he was inattentive and seemed disinterested in our table-there were only two of us and we're definitely not high maintenance so i'm not sure what the issue was.\n\nour waiter was in no way personable and just rubbed me the wrong way. maybe we caught him on a bad night. maybe he didn't feel like we deserved the attention that someone who was ordering off of the regular menu did. regardless, in these economically unbalanced times, when so many people are opting to eat cheaper or stay home and cook, i feel like the restaurant industry should feel the pressure to give diners the experience they pay for. even if we were getting your dishes for a reduced price-we are still dining in your restaurant and your standard of service should be equal across the board. you are a fine dining restaurant and i hold you to a higher standard than, say a denny's. but if you perform like a denny's waiter, i will tip you like a denny's waiter. \n\n\ni'm not sure i would come back because i was truly annoyed with the service. maybe i'd come back for the guava soup...and have it at the bar.", 
            "restaurant week 2011. the wife and i only planned on going out only once for restaurant week, but after perusing all the menus we were persuaded to try one more place -- scarpetta at the cosmopolitan. we were seated at a two-top by the window overlooking the bellagio fountains. one of the better views in town, it makes for a great spot for a romantic night out. the clean lines and modern motif of the restaurant interior add to the upscale and elegant atmosphere.\n\nscarpetta might have one of the best bread baskets around, but that can solely be attributed to the stromboli found within. warm, chewy and delicious, it's almost a meal itself. the focaccia isn't bad either.\n\nthe first two dishes were <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> and polenta. the <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> consisted of four slices of fish topped with olio di zenzero, pickled red onions and microgreens. a couple slices were bland and under seasoned, while others were perfect. the other app ordered came on the recommendation of our waiter. and, i'm glad i listened to him. the <mark>Creamy Polenta</mark> came in a decent sized bowl along with a pot with truffled mushrooms fricassee, which the server promptly spooned into the polenta. the rich and savory dish was unlike any polenta i've had before. \n\nthe <mark>Prime Aged Sirloin</mark> beef entree came sliced, cooked medium rare as ordered and was accompanied by a few light and fluffy potato gnocchi, wild mushrooms, barolo ragu, and topped with paper thin slices of parmigiano. the sirloin was good, but not nearly as good as the other entree.\n\nthe <mark>Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti</mark> didn't look like much when it was placed on the table -- a shallow bowl filled with a modest amount of small stuffed pasta. but, the flavor from each bite was amazing. each piece was a thin, delicate piece of pasta stuffed with tender short rib, with an intensely rich sauce. i loved the added texture that the bread crumbs added. it was a great dish on every level.\n\ndesserts were tasty, as well. amadei <mark>Chocolate Cake</mark> with toasted almond gelato and salted caramel sauce was dense and moist. the <mark>Coconut Panna Cotta</mark> with coconut sorbetto, guava soup and pineapple was surprisingly light, creamy, and not too filling. it was a beautiful presentation with the guava soup covering and contrasting the <mark>Coconut Panna Cotta</mark> below.\n\nour service was a perfect compliment to our meal. luis timed everything perfectly and provided the kind of personalized, friendly service that every top-notch restaurant should have.\n\ni've had plenty of underwhelming experiences over the years for restaurant week, but this was definitely one of the best. i'm already thinking about when i'll be able to come back and hopefully enjoy more great food and service.", 
            "for years, i've always felt that -- among the casinos -- the mgm grand has the best restaurants.  this may be changing, and scarpetta is *certainly* one of the biggest reasons why.  \n\nlynn and i followed up our \"good\" dinner wednesday night at comme \\u00c7a (also <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark>) with dinner at scarpetta the next night (followed friday night by los, but that's been written up way to many times).  \n\nbeing a celebrity chef is a double-edged sword . . . it certainly gets your name out there, but then you (typically) aren't there to defend it -- someone else is in the kitchen is, but if it sucks, you get the blame.  a potentially dicey proposition at best.\n\nscott conant need not worry; his vegas outpost is in excellent hands.\n\nthe six of us began with a bottle of n.v. champagne from chartogne-taillet (cuv\\u00e9e ste.-anne), and ordered a round of appetizers \"for the table.\"  (the table, too, apparently was hungry -- not just the six of us!)  \n\nfinishing the champagne just as the appetizers arrived, we moved into a 2008 bruno giacosa arneis.  we enjoyed the <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> crudo, the <mark>Creamy Polenta</mark> with a fricassee of truffled mushrooms (the winner of this round, imho), and the roasted sea scallops with porcini and sunchokes . . . all were delightful!\n\nvegetarian alert:  this place is *very* cool, and vegetarian-friendly.  they have a totally separate vegetarian and vegan menu available for the asking (as one in our party did).\n\nmoving into the pasta course, we had the spaghetti with tomato and basil (so simple to say, so profound to eat -- nothing can describe the layers of flavor that you get here; magnificent!), the duck & <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark> with marsala reduction (ok, this is to die for!), and the <mark>Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti</mark> with with brown butter horseradish.  of course, we also moved into a stunning piedmontese red, the 1999 barbaesco riserva vigneti in ovello from the  produttori del barbaresco.  just gorgeous!\n\nour entr\\u00e9es included <mark>Black Cod</mark> with caramelized fennel & concentrated tomato, sirloin with potato gnocchi, wild mushrooms, parmigiano & barolo ragu, a veal chop the size of baltimore (and much more tasty), and the aforementioned spaghetti with tomato and basil (as an entr\\u00e9e portion).  \n\na little dessert, a little porto and coffee, and the world is a perfect place!\n\np.s. in case you haven't figured it out yet, their wine list is not only incredible, but there are some true gems on this list that remain real bargains (if you know how/where to look).",

            "3.97 stars.\n\nafter a long day traveling to las vegas via los angeles, we were hungry and ready to celebrate our rather short weekend in sin city.  we were able to get a booth in the designated bar area that was a bit more casual than the beautiful main dinning room.  oh \"little shoe\", how pretty you are.  ambiance:  4 stars.  \n\nwe started with a few appetizers:  the beet salad (2.5 stars) that my friend said was just okay and average at best; the chestnut soup (4 stars) was actually quiet nice and sort of like a bisque with nice chunks of pickled brussel sprouts that i usually never have, but really enjoyed; and the <mark>Braised Short Ribs of Beef</mark> (3.5 stars) with fall root vegetables and faro risotto.\n\none dinner entree was the tagliatelle pasta (3.75 stars) with fall root vegetables, truffle zabaglione and guanciale (italian bacon).  this was the lighter of our three dishes and came in 3rd place.  the runner up dish was the duck & <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark> in a marsala reduction (5 stars!)  wonderfully rich and decadent, like buttah!!!  we thought the best dish was the <mark>Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti</mark> (5 stars!) of brown butter horseradish.  a stellar dish that had such an intriguing zing of fresh horseradish.  giddy up little doggie, giddy up!!\n\nservice was okay, a bit non existent initially and it took awhile to get two additional settings for our party of three; then ask for a missing bread dish.  other than that, the waiter made his italian wine recommendations that turned out to be not bad.  service:  4 stars.\n\ntally:  \nambiance:  4 stars  (\"new romantic\" 80's music, a tad bit loud)\nbeet salad:  2.5 stars\nchestnut soup:  4 stars\n<mark>Braised Short Ribs of Beef</mark>:  3.5 stars\ntagliatelle pasta:  3.75 stars\nduck & <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark>:  5 stars!\n<mark>Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti</mark>:  5 stars!\nservice:  4 stars\n4+2.5+4+3.5+3.75+5+5+4= 31.75/8= 3.97 stars.", 
            "i wanted to give this place more stars. interested to see how this place was since well the show chopped haha. \n\nrun down of us: came here for a bachelorette party dinner, don't be fooled us girls love to eat.\n\nthe atmosphere was nice and the drinks were good. it is kinda dressy so be prepared. the service was ok, and our particular server wasn't that attentive but i guess it was a busy night. \n\non to the food we tried several dishes: \n\n1. braised short ribs\n\n2. tagliatelle\n\n3. duck and <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark>\n\n4. <mark>Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti</mark>\n\nthey were all decent, the pasta was good and the sauces were fine. i think my favorite was the duck and <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark> but it was super rich so i didn't eat much of it. i wanted to try more things but i was so full. overall, it was a decent place and a good choice for a group dinner, but not sure if i would go there again.", 
            "the final meal of our vegas escapade was well spent at scarpetta. it wasn't completely perfect but most of the night made up for the little missteps (we'll get to that later) so for the most part, i had nothing but a good time. attentive service, rich indulgent food, all housed within an intimate space with gorgeous views of the ballagio fountains, we closed our trip in pure hedonistic style.\n\nwe started with some of their signature cocktails as we browsed the menu. upon the recommendation from our fantastic server, and the joys of libation, we decided on the tasting menu ($99) and accompanying wine pairing ($49) since several of the dishes that we wanted to try were on it anyway and boy did we pick right. that was the beginning of six courses of pure pleasure.\n\nwe started with a sashimi plate (http://www.<mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark>.com/biz_photos/0nmtwqyeqikerdv4a55obg?select=yvhgcff5cqsiopyc83uwwa) which consisted of <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> with a drizzle of ginger oil and red onions. the other half of the plate sat the <mark>Tuna susci</mark> - tuna wrapped marinated vegetables. the fish was so fresh and the flavors were delicately balanced. the bread basket came shortly after and there was a nice selection including yummy foccacia and stromboli. as part of the tasting menu, the chef also threw in a couple of surprises and we were treated to a delightful seafood <mark>Crispy Fritto Misto</mark> for this course. perfectly crispy fried but not oily, every bite was yummy and the rock shrimp just melted in my mouth.  \n\nthe next course was a perfectly roasted sea scallop. (http://www.<mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark>.com/biz_photos/0nmtwqyeqikerdv4a55obg?select=06qyvnxbie8hftnykn4obw) it was a joy to eat and the velvety salmoriglio sauce was a nice accompaniment to the sweet and juicy scallop. the chef's extra this course was a polenta with a truffle mushroom stew. (http://www.<mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark>.com/biz_photos/0nmtwqyeqikerdv4a55obg?select=gtrwgpr4xgghmw0rvryanw) for the record i hate cornmeal and thus hate grits, tamales, and polenta. yet, i could not stop eating this polenta. the flavors of the mushroom stew combine with the impeccably smooth polenta. (i suspect there's a whole lot more butter in it than what chef scott conant lets on) it was a nice double headliner with the scallop. \n\nnext up was the pasta course and chef conant's signature tomato & basil spaghetti. (http://www.<mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark>.com/biz_photos/0nmtwqyeqikerdv4a55obg?select=jqrljq4g8bgizxs0bc8bow) fresh made pasta in a simple tomato basil (+ quarter stick of butter) sauce but just perfectly executed. while i thoroughly enjoyed it, the chef's extra this course, the <mark>Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti</mark> with brown butter horseradish & toasted breadcrumb (http://www.<mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark>.com/biz_photos/0nmtwqyeqikerdv4a55obg?select=wzfcolektvylois628h_ag), totally blew my mind. wow who would have thought that the combination of short ribs, horseradish, and toasted breadcrumbs could be so sublime? i miss it already as i speak. \n\nthe next course was the <mark>Black Cod</mark>. (http://www.<mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark>.com/biz_photos/0nmtwqyeqikerdv4a55obg?select=2tmoceavt5t4aeu8j6itra) again perfectly seared but wonderfully moist in the middle. the fatty fish absolutely stands out against the sauce and caramelized fennel. delicious. the next entree course was a the <mark>Spiced Duck Breast</mark>. (http://www.<mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark>.com/biz_photos/0nmtwqyeqikerdv4a55obg?select=br1frh72uravjtrhiq6w-a) while this was my least favorite dish of the night, it was still absolutely delicious which tells you the quality of the food all night. the orange and spices (i kept picking up 5 spice) worked well with gamy duck. all in all, a successful combination. \n\nfinal course and dessert was a <mark>Chocolate Cake</mark> with toasted almond gelato and caramel. (http://www.<mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark>.com/biz_photos/0nmtwqyeqikerdv4a55obg?select=udi5apzqgqwuqcgjvukosg) this is where i really had to throw in the towel after all that eating. the <mark>Chocolate Cake</mark> was really rich and decadent and i could only finish half of it but i just couldn't let the toasted almond gelato go to waste. it was just delicious. you can totally taste the toasted flavor. \n\nnow on to the kink of the night. since we were seated by the wine cellar, the sommelier came by several times to retrieve bottles of wine. each single time, he let the door hit me as i was eating without even acknowledging it, much less apologize. not that it was a deal breaker but you expect a little more basic courtesy especially when you're dropping good money on dinner. \n\nstill for a wonderfully decadent meal paired with friendly and attentive service, we had a good time and i strongly recommend scarpetta if you want to treat yourself to a fine meal on the strip.", 
            "simple elegant food. i would recommend this place to the most discerning of palates! the scallop was perfectly seasoned and cooked. the spaghetti was simple but addicting! the <mark>Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti</mark> was super flavorful and the tagliatelle with root veggies was absolutely devine!", 
            "the bread basket alone would bring me back! that stromboli is amazing! i love salami and bread, so put the two together.....fuggetaboutit!\n\nwe had the tasting menu: \n\n- duo of <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> and tuna \"susci\": melt in your mouth delicious!\n\n- roasted sea scallops, cauliflower, bottarga, chili and caper salmoriglio: sea scallops can be rubbery and chewy if not cooked properly, but at scarpetta, they were cooked to perfection. they had the consistency of flaky, firm fish and the roasted cauliflower was a perfect pairing.\n\n- spagetti tomato basil - simple and good, but not memorable.\n\n- <mark>Black Cod</mark>, caramelized fennel & concentrated tomatoes - the fish was nice and flakey and the tomatoes added a nice acidity to the fish. i'm not a fan of fennel as they are too \"licorice-y\" in flavor for my taste.\n\n- <mark>Spiced Duck Breast</mark>, endive, preserved orange and cippollini - delicious! i love duck, but i hate when its not cooked properly or tastes overly fatty. this was a perfect balance. the preserved orange cut through the richness of the duck. yum!\n\n- amedei <mark>Chocolate Cake</mark> & toasted almond gelato - toasted almond gelato & salted caramel sauce. self explanatory....it was heaven!\n\nwhat made this experience special was that the chef brought out a few mini appetizers with every dish served, so it was like having an \"extended\" tasting menu. he brought out:\n\n- <mark>Crispy Fritto Misto</mark> - seafood, vegetables, artichokes, herbs & lemon\n- <mark>Creamy Polenta</mark> - fricassee of truffled mushrooms: by far my favorite dish at scarpetta. upon first glance, it looks like it would be too heavy and rich, but it was amazing!\n- <mark>Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti</mark> - brown butter horseradish & toasted breadcrumb.\n- zeppole - nutella center, vanilla sauce and candied hazelnuts. need i say more?\n\ni loved the ambiance and service of this restaurant. we were seated by the window facing the fountains of bellagio. a beautiful place to take someone on a date!", 
            "the wife and i were in vegas on vacation and her younger cousin and his gf were in town the same week so we wanted to take them out to a nice dinner.  i didn't have a chance to check out scarpetta when i was last here in november, so this seemed like a perfect time.  \n\nthe room is absolutely beautiful, and we were lucky enough to get seated near a window, so we could also watch the bellagio fountain show at the same time.  i was thinking, this night is going to be perfect right......maybe not.  so the server comes to take our drink order.  i'm a simple guy, so i just ordered a miller lite.......he kind of looks at me and is like \" bud \".  i'm like ok, nevermind.  can i get a stella instead?  he's like yup.  i'm like.... ok.  then he leaves and the busser brings over the bread basket full of win~!  the bread was a salami roll, as well as some focaccia, and what looked like some french baguette.  the busser really explained the different condiments they had for the bread well.  he had a thick accent, so it was a little difficult to understand, but he did a nice job explaining it.  he left and our server came back with the beer....a bud.  i'm like...seriously, i just told you  stella?  then my wife's cousin asks him a bit about the condiments (mascarpone, some eggplant tapenade, and some olive oil) and if there is a certain one that is recommended for the different breads.   he's like i don't know, they're all good.  i'm like....seriously?  then we get around to ordering our apps and entrees.  we started with the braised shortribs and the <mark>Crispy Fritto Misto</mark>.....both were great.  the shortribs were very tender and flavorful.  the <mark>Crispy Fritto Misto</mark>,was crunchy and not oily either.  we then ordered our entrees. my wife and her cousin ordered the <mark>Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti</mark>, the cousins gf ordered the lamb loin.  haha, we could already tell how our waiter was, so for fun, she asked him how the lamb was.  you would think at a nicer upscale restaurant like this, he would boast about the preparation, or the sauce, or how tender the meat was......nope.  when she asked how it was, he said \"good.\"  really?  i thought restaurants made money by putting crap on the menu?  anyways, back to lucky old me.  i asked the waiter about the spaghetti with basil (which is what lots of people rave about) or the stracci.  he was like it's ok, but it's kind of plain.  not sure if he was trying to upsell me, but i don't know if scott conant would appreciate one of his servers calling his food plain.  anyways, i took his advice and order the stracci.  or did i?  because even if i ordered the stracci, that's not what was placed in front of me when the rest of the order came around.  i looked at the guy and was like \"didn't i tell you stracci?\"  oh, i'm not sure, let me check.  seriously?  what the hell, can this really be happening.  anyways, i waited patiently like a fool, while everybody else ate.  to scarpetta's defense, all the entrees were really good and flavorful, just the guy serving us needed a clue.  we moved on to dessert and ordered the <mark>Chocolate Cake</mark> (a bit too heavy for me), the <mark>Coconut Panna Cotta</mark> (awesome!), and the cheesecake (light, airy, completely delicious).  the waiter comped us an order of zeppole's for his lack of service, and it too was great.  \n\noverall, i was just disappointed that the service was so poor.  i was really looking forward to having a wonderful night with family and friends, but it ended up just being ok.  too bad", 
            "i tried the tasting menu with wine pairing and i nearly died from how full i became.  i ordered the tasting menu because i was unsure about what to chose from the menu - there were quite a few dishes i was torn between and i decided to just give them all a shot since a lot of the items i wanted to try was on the tasting menu.\n\nthe food and wine pairing was a great experience.  the service was impeccable - they gave me extra dishes to sample in addition to my tasting menu.  the fresh made potato chips sitting at the bar was also a temptation that i kept on coming back for.  \n\nthe stand out dishes i tried that night were:\n\npolenta - wow, never had i had polenta as silky as this before.  the mushrooms and sauce were perfect with the polenta.  i savored every bit of it.\n\nspaghetti - this definitely hit the spot.  the noodles were hand made and the sauce was quite simple, but elegant.  a very simple dish but i was in love with it.\n\n<mark>Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti</mark> - the first few bites were surprising, but what i loved about it would be the kick the horseradish that was in the sauce gave it.  each bit teased my tongue and i couldn't help but go back for seconds!\n\n<mark>Spiced Duck Breast</mark> - my favorite dish from all of the ones i tried that night.  the <mark>Spiced Duck Breast</mark> was very tender, had a bit of au jus in them and didn't have a game-y taste to it.  the <mark>Spiced Duck Breast</mark> was cooked to perfection, with the meat being so very tender and the skin having a bit of a crunch to it and the endive and sauce went so well with it.  \n\nit was a lovely dining experience.  i wouldn't mind coming again and ordering one of these delightful dishes a la cart.", 
            "warning, this beautiful restaurant is in the cosmopolitan which is a pretentious somewhat tacky casino/hotel. except for the hostess, who seemed a little  \"too cool\" for the guests, the staff gets an a+ for service. titus was our main waiter but there were two other gentlemen who were on the spot and very kind.  we had a beautiful view of the bellagio fountains as well. the warm bread basket with a variety of breads (foccacia, stromboli, etc) was served with a 3 different types of dips (an eggplant thing, olive oil, and butter) and they were all so delicious. we started our meals with a shared beet salad and polenta. to say the polenta was amazing would not give it enough credit. it was creamy and consistent, topped with truffled mushrooms, garlic, and sauce. the serving was large enough to share. i could have had another serving of the polenta and been quite happy and full. the beet salad was crisp and came with a generous serving of gooey cheese (stracciatella), pumpkin seeds and balsamic dressing.  it was fresh and tasty.  my friend and i shared the duck and <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark> and <mark>Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti</mark>. my friend loved the ravioli and loved the marsala reduction. i felt the duck and foie gras had a weird texture and i didn't care much for it. but that could have been a mental thing since i have opinions about foie gras practices. the sauce was delicious however and perfect for dipping some bread into. i wasn't sure what to expect with the short rib. it was small rib pieces in noodle wrapping covered with breadcrumbs (?), brown butter and horseradish. whoa the horseradish was strong but so delicious! if i hadn't filled up with polenta and bread, i could have finished my plate. it was so delicious. but if you find horseradish to be strong or can only tolerate a little, skip this meal! there wasn't any room for the dessert. but the options looked tempting. oh i forgot we had moscato de' asti that complimented the meal throughout. the price seemed fair for the quality and service. one of the most delicious meals i have ever had.", 
            "if you go here at night, make sure you get a good view of the bellagio fountains because that's half the experience of going here. the other half is the delicious ham and cheese bread they give you. i probably could have just eaten that for a meal.\n\nanyway, food came out a little slow. the duck and <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark> was indeed salty as another reviewer mentioned. i did enjoy the <mark>Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti</mark> though. not sure if i've ever tasted anything like it before.",

            "my favorite thing about vegas is not the casinos, shows, or nightclubs (although the latter is a close second), but the abundance and quality of fine dining.  one of my girl friends requested that we dine at the cosmopolitan on our vegas getaway, so i picked scarpetta because it was spendy but not quite a splurge like \\u00e9 by jos\\u00e9 andr\\u00e9s or blue ribbon sushi bar & grill.\n\nas far as italian food goes, scarpetta was scrumptious, though overpriced like everything on the strip.  my girl friends and i were seated at a big, chic horseshoe booth--and if it weren't for our next destination (dancing at tryst and xs), i likely would've drank and ate more here. \n\nfor my appetizer i had the spring <mark>Chilled Pea Soup</mark> ($16) with gulf shrimp, guanciale (italian bacon), and reisling gelee.  it was the most delicious <mark>Chilled Pea Soup</mark> i've ever had in my life! incredibly balanced, fresh, flavorful, and masterfully presented.  \n\nfor my main i had the duck & <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark> ($26) with marsala reduction.  i absolutely wanted to love this dish due to the presence of foie gras, but i could barely taste the foie gras, let alone the duck.  i did appreciate, however, that the pasta was homemade.  crystal l.'s main course, the <mark>Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti</mark> ($25), with brown butter horseradish and toasted breadcrumb was a much better choice for pasta--i was so happy when she literally gave me half!  i knew then and there that this was going to be a wonderful night!\n\nif you like classic trattoria fare, i wouldn't go to scarpetta.  but if you don't mind fancy, modern italian, look no further.", 
            "we have eaten at scarpetta in vegas 2 times and once at the miami location.  after eating at the vegas location the first time, we were so impressed and loved the food so much we chose it for the location of our rehearsal dinner.   \n\nwe had our wedding rehearsal dinner for 32 people at scarpetta in the vino room on 6/15.  i'm so happy we did.  everything was absolute perfection.  i have to give a shout out to the staff at scarpetta especially kelly racine for all of her help.  she was fantastic throughout this process.   \n\nwe had a menu that consisted of the following\n\nbraised short ribs (very good)\ncreamy pollenta (to die for)\nheirloom tomato salad\n\nspaghetti (in no way over rated)\n<mark>Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti</mark> (spectacular in every way)\n\n<mark>Black Cod</mark> (did not have this for my entree, but it got good reviews)\nsirloin with gnocchi & wild mushrooms (delish!)\n\nwe also had two different desserts served to our table that were outstanding. \n\nthe waitstaff was fantastic, very polite and moved around the room seamlessly.   i can not wait to return for another meal.   and if you're looking for a place to have a small wedding reception or rehearsal dinner, i highly recommend adding scarpetta to your list of restaurants to check out.", 
            "i had been dying to try scarpetta for about a year and we finally got around to it this weekend. you walk up to the bar area which is a skinny hallway that eventually opens up into a beautiful large room. we lucked out and got a table with a view of the bellagio fountains. it was a really great view and so fun to watch. our server greeted us right away and he had great suggestions and a good sense of humor, always a plus.  \n\nwe started with the complimentary bread basket and it was super fantastic, possibly my favorite bread basket on the strip! there is a delicious stromboli bread filled with warm meat and cheese. there is also an herb bread, a nice piece of crusty bread, and a little cloud like square pillow of bread. there are also 3 spreads, an eggplant, a mascarpone buttery spread, and a citrus olive oil. i am not a fan of eggplant in general so i didn't try that one but i couldn't decide which of the other 2 i liked more. so yummy!\n\ni started with the heirloom beet salad. there was an array of different colored beets, 2 little wedges of la tur cheese, a few micro-greens, and some hazelnuts sprinkled throughout the plate. everyone together was great, i just wish there was a bit more acid to break up the savoriness of the dish. i could only stomach half of it before it just became too rich, luckily my husband was happy to eat the other half. \n\ni moved on to my entree, the <mark>Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti</mark>. the pasta was so delicate and light. the horseradish brown butter had a little kick to it and overpowered the dish just a little. again, i found this dish very savory and wasn't able to eat the entire plate. again, my husband saved the day. \n\nmy husband ordered the turbot, it was delicate and so delicious with a light and airy crust. the little parsnips hidden under the fish were my favorite part of the dish, so well done. we also got a side of the broccoli rabe, which was good but nothing special. \n\nour waiter talked us into dessert and we were so happy he did. we ordered the nutella and vanilla creme bombolini and can't recommend it enough. we received six little fried donuts filled with nutella or vanilla creme with a yummy caramelized banana on the side. everything worked so well together. it wasn't overly sweet, just a nice end to the meal. \n\noverall, we had a great meal with a great view! i would definitely go back, if only for the bread basket.", 
            "we came here twice.  the second time service was awesome!  the waiter we had was so attentive and cool as in hip to everything.  the food was amazing and deliciously consistent with the new york location, but you're in vegas!!!  \nit's nice they have seasonal items so there is always something new to try.  i started with the autumn vegetable soup (dreamy and creamy), my husband had the tartart special.  he loved it and wouldn't share.  then we had a pasta course, i can't stop getting the spaghetti.....i can't!  colin got the <mark>Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti</mark>, which was very buttery good...  then we had the nerve to share the 24 oz ribeye,  it was soooooo good, tender and perfectly seasoned.  we actually ate it all!  plus the sides, horseradish mashed potatoes....\n\nmario, the manager was extremely nice and helped us out with a service problem we experienced on our last visit and made everything perfect for this visit.  we did not expect the extra desserts brought out for us to try.  you have to try the little donuts (bomboloni) and the coconut panacotta was very tropical with a guava sauce...my favorite group, depeche mode was playing and when they found out, they changed the playlist to only play their songs!  \nthere are so many choices of places to try in vegas and this is a must.  worth every penny and worth several more visits.", 
            "i had such high hopes for scarpetta. we came on a sunday night at 6:40pm, a bit late for our reservation but we were seated promptly.\n\nthe bread came quickly, and was amazing. there was sourdough, a type with meat in it, ciabatta, and some other small roll. it came with olive oil, tomato, and cheese mixed with butter as toppings, which were really delicious.\n\nthe <mark>Creamy Polenta</mark> with truffled mushrooms was also quite amazing, especially on the bread.\n\nfor some reason though, when our entrees came, everything just went downhill.\nthe duck and <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark> just tasted weird and a bit too salty. the <mark>Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti</mark> wasn't very tender or flavorful. the vegetable spaghetti was a bit better and the broccoli was pretty good. overall though, a bit disappointed. perhaps it was just an off night.", 
            "my friend had tried the scarpetta in la and had raved about it, so when she came to town we had to try the one at the cosmopolitan hotel. she was absolutely right (she usually is ;) and i have been back several times since first trying it with her. \n\nthe restaurant is beautifully done .. very contemporary and chic .. and most every seat boasts a fabulous view of the bellagio fountain show. it's a great place for entertaining out-of-town guests for sure. one time we even had the privilege of being seated at the \"chefs\" table (which is in a private room) with a prime view of the fountain show and the entire kitchen. \n\nthe food .. what can i say .. everything we've tried there is spectacular! my favorites are the <mark>Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti</mark>, which is simply melt-in-your mouth goodness and the tagliatelle with fall vegetables, truffle zabagalione & guanciale, which is just the right amount of truffle and is nice and light. i've also tried that famous spaghetti .. it's good, very good, but not something that i would order again. some of my dining partners have tried the lobster pasta, the <mark>Black Cod</mark> and the <mark>Spiced Duck Breast</mark> and the little bites i tried were good, but not necessarily items i would order. \n\nfrom the starters, my favorites are the <mark>Creamy Polenta</mark>, again with truffle :) and the <mark>Braised Short Ribs of Beef</mark>. the calamari and the scallops are also good, but we keep going back to the polenta. \n\ndessert .. the most important part of the meal .. the second time we were there, we saw something at another table that looked delicious and right up our alley .. turns out it was not on their menu but from the neighboring scott conant eatery docg enoteca. it's called the salted caramel budino with pretzel toffee.  it is super creamy and  the perfect balance of both sweet and salty at the same time. we shared it the first go-around but now order one each whenever we go .. and that rarely happens. \n\nthe service is impeccable, friendly knowledgeable servers and bussers who go the extra mile and have great personalities. the first time we were there my dining partner mentioned she was heading to dc the following weekend and our server came back with a list of fun things / places for her to do while she was there.", 
            "fantastic!  \ndinner at scarpetta was the last of 3 amazing valentine gifts.  i wanted to come here because i'm a fan of scott contant, and i was not disappointed. \n\nour meal was absolutely fantastic, the service was top notch and the atmosphere was perfect.\n\nwe started with a light and delicate glass of wine to go with <mark>Creamy Polenta</mark> and a fricassee of truffled mushrooms, i had the <mark>Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti</mark> and dave had the duck & <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark>, both were amazing and you know it had to be for me to eat foie gras :-)  we ended the meal perfectly with pana cotta and bomboloni. \n\ni highly recommend you come here when celebrating your next special moment, or, if your just in the mood for a perfect evening with the one you love.", 
            "we had an absolutely perfect experience at scarpetta. from the ambience to the service to the food, everything was exemplary. furthermore, we lucked out with getting a window table with a view overlooking the bellaggio fountains next door. i started with the legendary tomato-basil spaghetti and quickly understood why it receives such rave reviews! the pasta was cooked perfectly al dente and the sauce was delightful. my friend was equally pleased with her truffled polenta starter and second course of <mark>Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti</mark>. the roasted scallops i chose were divine. we also shared a side of mixed mushrooms, but could hardly make a dent in them although they were delicious! in true vegas style, the portions are quite generous. don't skip on having a cocktail either - our frothy grapefruit gimlets were superb!", 
            "simply put scarpetta is my favorite vegas restaurant. \ni've been a few times and each time i've left as satisfied as possible. \n\nfor an appetizer, i've had the squash soup, the <mark>Tuna susci</mark>, and braised short ribs. the squash soup is some of the best i've ever had. the tuna was good but i wouldn't get it again. the braised short ribs were perfect and while i have no idea what was in that sauce, it was heavenly. probably will get the braised short ribs the next few times i go.\n\nas for entrees, they are famous for their duck and <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark> and believe me, it lives up to the loftiest of expectations. it's such a unique dish and the duck and foie gras compliment each other perfectly. it doesn't feel too heavy, goes down sooooo smoothly and has this great sauce on top with just the perfect amount of cheese. ive had it multiple times and plan on getting it again in the future. \ni've also had the <mark>Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti</mark> which is almost as superb. the short rib is great and you get this really tasty hint of horseradish in the sauce. it's far from overwhelming, just a hint of it, but after a full plate of the agnolotti, you can certainly tell its there. but it doesn't take away from the dish, the short rib and pasta are both great.\nwhile i've not tried the <mark>Black Cod</mark> or the steak, my companions have and they have reported being very happy with their choices.\n\noddly enough, i've not had dessert at scarpetta. maybe in the future i will, i'm sure it will be tasty.\n\na few other things to note: the view is superb, definitely ask for a window seat and you'll get a side view of the bellagio fountains. it's just a matter of luck and if they have a table available, ask when you make the reservation. the portions are great. so often vegas portions (especially at nice restaurants) are so small, but these are adequate and leaves you filling full but not overly full (as often dishes are so heavy with fat and cream and such). the price is very appropriate. nothing is exorbitantly pricy, nothing is cheap, the price is correct.", 
            "bread basket with stromboli, focaccia and other more basic roll.  the bread basket came with butter, eggplant areas and citrus olive oil.  the citrus olive oil was amazing paired with the stromboli!\n\nberry smash - this drink was very good\n\n<mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> sashimi - 4 stars. rock salt used was unique and <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> was tender.  \n\nsignature spaghetti dish -  5 stars. this dish was really incredible.  delicious in it's simplicity.   the noodles were cooked perfectly and the sauce light yet flavorful.  i have not had anything like it before and i will be trying to recreate it at home.\n\n<mark>Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti</mark> -  5 stars. this was excellent!  it has a very strong horse radish taste so you have got to really like horse radish!  \n\npici - 4 stars. this dish was very good.  the noodles are cooked al dente. a little too mu/ch so for my taste.  there was tons of lobster.  i enjoyed the lobster paired with the tarragon.  i do not normally like pesto but i really liked the chili pesto in this dish.  \n\nthe restaurant is very nice however we were a party of 5 and were seated right by the exit sign and bus area.  it seems this restaurant is more suited for parties of 4 our less. as there is not a lot of seating for a larger party.", 
            "we had a top notch dinner at scarpetta while enjoying the wonderful view of the bellagio water show. the fresh, warm bread basket with a delicious assortment was only a teaser of the wonderful meal to come. the service was excellent,  great detail.  our wine choice-a meursault  went very well with our meal.\nfor our appetizers:\ntuna 'susci'\nmarinated vegetables & preserved truffles -never had fresher tuna, \n<mark>Creamy Polenta</mark>\nfricassee of truffled mushrooms- just perfect, creamy and the fricassee was richly flavorful. \nentrees:\nmediterranean branzino\nshrimp, clams, mussels & celery root - crispy and sophisticated yet simply delicious\n<mark>Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti</mark>\nbrown butter horseradish & toasted breadcrumbs- perfect \ndessert:\nst<mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> souffle\nrhubarb compote & vanilla gelato-so light and satisfying, absolutely no sharing of this dessert. \nmy only disappointment was a side of the fingerling potatoes. they weren't bad but didn't live up to the level of the other dishes we had. \nwe are pleased to learn that they have a scarpetta in nyc. this restaurant warrants many more visits.", 
            "an amazing meal! my husband and i decided on scarpetta for dinner pretty much at the last minute. we were able to make a reservation on-line two hours prior to the reservation. we arrived about 15 minutes early and were sat right away. we were given a table by the window which allowed us to enjoy the bellagio fountain show (about three times during our meal!). the wait staff was attentive and very nice. they offered advice about portion size and house favorites. bread is served as you are seated, and it was delicious and fresh. the bread basket even includes stromboli! yum! we ordered a bottle of wine - a very good selection to chose from. my husband ordered the duck, and i got the <mark>Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti</mark> with a side of broccoli rabe to share. both meals were amazing! the atmosphere was modern yet casual. it felt sophisticated but comfortable. we will definitely be recommending to family and friends!", 
            "was here this past year for ces, and we had 2 events here.\none was our company dinner in the private room with a view of bellagio fountains and the other was a upper management meeting with a client over wine tasting in the private seating area which is in the kitchen.\n\nfor the wine tasting, it was pretty awesome, except the room is probably equipped to seat 8 people comfortably, maybe 10, we squeezed in 12.  we enjoyed some awesome wines and some desserts, which hey mistakenly sent to our table, so they ended up comping those and bringing more, it was very good.  \n\nthe cool thing about this private room, is that you have to walk through the kitchen to get to it and it is located next to the kitchen, with glass floor to ceiling so you can see into the kitchen as they work and cook and the background is a view of the bellagio fountains and the strip.  \n\nthe second occasion was for our company dinner a few nights later since they were able to accommodate our group of 16 in the private dining room that is in front of the restaurant and our big boss loves italian food.  \n\nalthough you can order single entrees off the menu, we had our waiter set up our dinner family style with some of his recommendations and some of the things we wanted to try.  \n\nalso, our big boss had a request for something off the menu and the chef obliged with no problems.  keeping the boss happy is always key!\n\nwe had the following dishes.\napps - braised short rib <mark>Braised Short Ribs of Beef</mark>, <mark>Creamy Polenta</mark>, <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> and <mark>Tuna susci</mark>\nthe short ribs and the polenta were my favorite, the susci was just ok.\n\nentrees - duck and <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark>, <mark>Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti</mark>, sheep milk ricotta agnolotti.  all were awesome, but the duck and <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark> is very rich.\n\nwe had dessert, but i don't actually remember what i had.\n\nservice was great and except the bar was slow, so they comped certain drinks that didn't show up in a time fashion.\n\nthe minus one star was for the sommelier, who seemed to enjoy the sound of his own voice and didn't really consider the requests of the guests at the table.  i understand he is very knowledgeable and he is an expert, but he could dial back the ego and work with the guest.  \n\nother than that, great place, i recommend it and you will not be disappointed.", 
            "my boyfriend and i are avid chopped fans and scott conant is our favorite judge so it was only right to come here to celebrate my boyfriend's birthday :) \n\nto start off the meal they brought out some bread with different dipping sauces/spreads... before even ordering we scarfed down the whole basket. it was seriously the best bread ever. even after we finished our entire meal we wanted more! \n\nwe ordered the <mark>Braised Short Ribs of Beef</mark> with vegetable and farro risotto as an appetizer and for our entrees we ordered the spaghetti and <mark>Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti</mark>. the spaghetti was fresh and the sauce had a good basil kick to it. but our favorite of the night had to be the <mark>Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti</mark>! the horseradish sauce was amazing and worked so perfectly with the agnolotti--it was like eating juicy prime rib in the form of pasta!", 
            "this is one of my favorite splurge dinner places in vegas. my friend and i came here during our annual girls weekend. we are both big fans of eating out so we were very excited to come here. our waiter was very attentive and we did not feel like we had to get his attention to order or get our check. one of the things i love about dining here is that they have one of the most extensive and delicious bread baskets ever (4 types of bread and 3 spread/dips). \n\nas for the food and drinks, we ordered a nice bottle of sauvignon blanc which was reasonably priced compared to their cocktail prices. we shared the polenta to start, which the restaurant kindly split between 2 bowls for us, which was a very nice gesture. for our entr\\u00e9es we shared the <mark>Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti</mark> and the black fettuccini. both dishes were delicious. however, the <mark>Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti</mark> was clearly the stand out and probably my favorite dish here. on a past visit, i have also ordered their spaghetti which sounds plain but is super flavorful. \n\nwe were pretty full and did not order dessert, but based on a prior visit, i highly recommend the bomboloni.", 
            "my wife and i went there to celebrate our anniversary. our table faced the bellagio and were entertained by their fountains all night long. the service was extraordinary. we started with the polenta. woooowwww! amazing texture and flavor. our second dish was <mark>Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti</mark>. spectacular horseradish sauce and the breadcrumbs add a very interesting and fun texture. for the main dish my wife ordered another agnolotti. this time it was the sheep milk with shaved summer truffles and parmesan emulsion. this dish is nothing short of brilliant. i had a newly added dish. it was the kobe rib cap. this was served beautifully med rare over homemade gnocchi, variety of mushrooms and with a barolo reduction. this was probably the best bite i've ever had!!! we will definitely come back soon! great experience.", 
            "with so many cooking competition shows out there, i've always been curious how good some of these renowned chefs and judges really are.  certain guys clearly have the cred to back it up, but there are others i'm not as familiar with.  chopped's scott conant was one of the latter, but i can now say, without a hint of doubt, that...\n\nscott conant is bad ass.\n\nalthough it may not have been the original scarpetta in ny, my meal at this location was still pretty fantastic.  i'd even say they rank as one of my all around favorite restaurants, along with the spence in atlanta and state bird provisions in san francisco.  honestly, everything we had was terrific.  it's also easy now to see why scott conant is so tough on contestants who dare to cook pasta on the show - scarpetta's ranks as the best i've had thus far!\n\n-- bread basket...complimentary\n(http://www.<mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark>.com/biz_photos/scarpetta-las-vegas?select=dpyovdlwt4wm9gcaxo59yw#hyft6dlcgha332ecjchzlq)\nnot normally something i would bother mentioning because bread is bread.  that is, unless it's got salami baked into it.  well played scott conant, well played.\n\n-- roasted diver scallops with morels, sugar snap, watermelon radish and pea froth...$23\n(http://www.<mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark>.com/biz_photos/scarpetta-las-vegas?select=dpyovdlwt4wm9gcaxo59yw#v_vestj9d5uur3salouvza)\nmy friend and i split an order and our server was kind enough to have it plated separately for us.  the scallop had a near perfect sear (could have been harder) and the center couldn't have been cooked any better - soft and tender.  the pea froth complemented the scallop's sweetness quite well.\n\n-- <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark> with a marsala reduction...$27\n(http://www.<mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark>.com/biz_photos/scarpetta-las-vegas?select=dpyovdlwt4wm9gcaxo59yw#rj2lg-ukltloss3cpgcryq)\nsimply fantastic.  i was already dead set on ordering this, but it was nice to find out it was one of their signature dishes.  the ravioli was amazing - silky and tender with just the right bite.  although the foie gras filling was awesome on its own, the marsala reduction made it that much better!\n\n-- <mark>Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti</mark> with brown butter, horseradish, and toasted breadcrumbs...$26\n(http://www.<mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark>.com/biz_photos/scarpetta-las-vegas?select=dpyovdlwt4wm9gcaxo59yw#x9wafdf-qarvghjn7g-iya)\nmy friend ordered this one and it gave the ravioli a serious run for its money.  the pasta was just as good in this dish and the short rib added a nice bit of savoriness.  the breadcrumbs didn't do a ton for me, but it still tasted great.\n\n-- st<mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> souffl\\u00c9 with a rhubarb compote and vanilla gelato...$11\n(http://www.<mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark>.com/biz_photos/scarpetta-las-vegas?select=dpyovdlwt4wm9gcaxo59yw#uugjpj3_-6a9_rbmptbrsa)\nnot to gush like a little girl, but damn this was good!  i thought the compote and gelato would be too much sweetness, but the dish had just the right amount of sweetness and the souffl\\u00e9 had a perfect consistency.  i honestly don't know what else to say other than that you must get this.\n\nwhile the meal itself was amazing, i thought some of the hostesses could really use an attitude check.  for some reason, they seem to think they're better than everyone else and do very little to hide it.  it seems other <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> have left with the same impression, but at least our waiter christian and the rest of the wait staff more than made up for it.\n\nbeyond the food and service though, scarpetta might be worth a trip just to take in the view!  the dining room area (not the bar section) has giant bay windows that face the bellagio fountains and the strip (http://www.<mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark>.com/biz_photos/scarpetta-las-vegas?select=dpyovdlwt4wm9gcaxo59yw#3ol0vvlkty4ygbugubi7cw).  unfortunate i was only there with a friend instead of a girlfriend though (sorry bud).  scarpetta, i'll definitely be seeing you again during my next trip to vegas.  and considering how often i seem to be there, it'll probably be a lot sooner than later!", 
            "so while at a convention in vegas, my two co-workers and i came here for dinner on 10/6/13 on a recommendation from a friend who claimed it's the best restaurant in the city. all three of us did the tasting menu ($110 per person) and two of us opted for the wine pairing with it (additional $45 per person). with all the delicious looking options on the menu, it seemed this was the way to go. here's what was included: \n\n-duo of <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> and tuna \"susci\". wine pairing: adami, prosecco, veneto, n/v. the \"susci\" was the first tasting and my least favorite of all. nothing special to me. or at least i didn't get what was supposed to be special about it. the roll with the carrots was kind of gross actually. i was hoping things would turn around quickly, and they did. ohhhh they did.\n\n-roasted diver scallops, morels, sugar snap, watermelon radish & pea froth. wine pairing: iberian remix, albarino, edna valley 2009. \nthe scallops were cooked perfectly and i enjoyed the puree that was served on the side. my friend however didn't enjoy the wine that was paired with it. he's a big albarino drinker and said it tasted like \"it was sitting on the shelf a little too long.\" i didn't really notice that until he said it, but i have to agree. that could have just been a bad bottle though and not an accurate representation of the wine itself.\n\n\n-spaghetti tomato basil & <mark>Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti</mark>. wine pairing: il poggione, rosso di montalcino, tuscany 2008. i don't care what anyone says- the spaghetti was fantastic. i'm drinking the kool-aid here. yes, the sauce is very simple, but it really made me notice and appreciate the texture and freshness of the noodles more. sometimes spaghetti is better when it's simple i guess. i would definitely order it again. \n\nthe <mark>Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti</mark>- dish of the night. the three of us unanimously agreed on this. one of the best pasta dishes i've ever devoured in 10 seconds. the horseradish breadcrumbs were a great finishing touch.\n\n-fennel spiced <mark>Black Cod</mark>, concentrated tomatoes, mantecato & black olive oil. wine pairing: jermann red angel, pinot noir, friuli 2008. \nthe cod was spiced well, but maybe a tad undercooked for my liking. i still finished it. \n\n-<mark>Spiced Duck Breast</mark>, endive, preserved orange &\ncippollini. wine pairing: feudi di san gregorio, rubrato, aglianico, campania 2009. the duck was perfectly cooked and had tremendous flavor. my friend sitting next to me was already so stuffed by this point, that he couldn't eat his, so being the fat fuck that i am, i ate his too.\n\n-amedei <mark>Chocolate Cake</mark> toasted almond gelato. wine pairing: quinta do noval, colheita, tawny port, portugal 1997. i'm normally not a big dessert guy, but this cake was outstanding. perfect way to cap off the tasting.\n\n...and here were a few complimentary items our table was given to share:\n\n- bread basket. it was served with three different dips (citrus olive oil, tomato-eggplant, and marscapone butter). some of the pieces of bread had salami baked into it, and those were amazing! just try not to fill up on them if you're doing the tasting menu, because you have a lot of food on the way.\n\n- <mark>Creamy Polenta</mark> with fricassee of truffled mushrooms. the polenta was definitely one of the highlights, although it could have benefited from being a tad thicker since the mushroom sauce liquified it significantly, once mixed  in. but great flavors, nonetheless.\n\n- shoe string calamari and zucchini. i think there was some fennel in here too. we finished every last string.\n\n\nall three of us immensely enjoyed the tasting menu. to say that we were not left disappointed by the portion sizes would be an understatement. we could barely walk out of there without toppling over. i certainly didn't have much room for alcoholic beverages for the remainder of the night. probably a good thing, knowing me and vegas.\n\nyou might notice i didn't have much to say about the wines. that's because unlike the food, they were all pretty unremarkable. i'm a pretty avid wine drinker and i didn't recognize any of these wines by name before they were poured for me, so it was almost expected. if i ever did the tasting menu again, i'd most likely skip the wine pairing option and just order a bottle of something decent and familiar off their wine menu. \n\nmy biggest gripe about this place was the waiter. although friendly and accommodating, he could barely be heard over the background noise, and with his thick accent, it made him very difficult to understand. tastings obviously are supposed to be interactive and i had to ask him to repeat everything he said at least once. this became a little frustrating and kind of depreciated the experience for me. i wish he had left a copy of the menu on our table so i didn't have to go to their website afterward to finally discover what some of the things i ate were.\n\nthe bottom line is i would definitely return to scarpetta, especially since i just realized there is one in beverly hills (doh!).", 
            "during my first stay in vegas i knew i needed to plan out where i wanted to fine dine. after combing through many reviews i made a reservation at  scarpetta a week in advance. the three stars are given more for the ambience then the food. our table looked out to the bellagio and we were able to watch the fountain show as we dined. \n\ngreat disappointment fell over me as i began to eat the farmer's market salad. beautiful yes, full of wonder fresh veggies but unless you got a mouthful of pecorino in every bite it was severely under seasoned. \n\nwe both ordered pasta dishes. my bf the <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark> and i the short rib and <mark>Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti</mark>. the pasta itself was light and delicious. the marsala reduction on the duck foie gras was a little powerful over the duck flavor but overall a good dish. however, the horseradish flavor in the agnolotti was so overpowering it left my palette craving to be cleansed after each mouthful. \n \n\ni'm glad i tried scarpetta but based on this visit not sure i would be willing to give it another opportunity to disappoint.", 
            "the environment is cool and classy.  you can get away with casual attire, but a little dressier would fit better.  this is definitely an option for a romantic dinner as well.\n\nthe service team was attentive and friendly.  the bread basket is filled with tasty options.\n\nfor my meal i ordered the short rib & <mark>Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti</mark>.  it was very good.  it also has brown butter, horseradish and bread crumbs as part of the meal.  the horseradish is very subtle, so do not get scared away by that.  the bone marrow helps give it deep flavor.  the meal is very good.  the portion is modest, so definitely consider an appetizer, soup or salad to pair with it.", 
            "what a gem! i am in l o v e. \n\ni'm gonna give you the play by play... but really all you need to know is to just go.\n\nappetizer:\nheirloom tomato and burrata salad. sounds typical, and honestly not terrifically unique, but it was done well. perfectly ripe tomatoes with the creamiest burrata. microgreens on top added just the right balance of herby bite.\n\npastas:\nspaghetti. holy moly. who knew that some plain spaghetti could have such nuanced and delicious flavors. i looked up the recipe online as soon as i got back to my hotel because you know this is making an appearance asap at home.\n\npici with pesto and lobster. very solid. i don't think this is an attempt-at-home pasta. it was excellent though.\n\n<mark>Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti</mark>. solid choice. very flavorful.\n\nfor all the pastas, they were cooked perfectly. spaghetti really stole the show though.\n\nentree:\ni had the fennel dusted cod. honestly i was already getting pretty full by then... so i don't think i enjoyed it as much as i would have without the pasta binge. however, it was cooked perfectly and the first few bites were delectable. i actually couldn't finish because after our shared app and pastas, i was already getting full. the accompanying veg were also expertly cooked and paired well with the fatty fish.\n\neveryone else opted for the duck, veal, and filet. meat eaters i guess.\n\ndesserts:\n<mark>Coconut Panna Cotta</mark>. this was the second recipe i researched as soon as i got home. i am so excited to make this. hawaii is my favorite place on earth and this is just hawaii in your mouth. silky, smooth, and perfect.  coconut, guava... so so tasty.\n\nchocolate souffle. i'm not the biggest souffle fan, but even i can appreciate the technical skill and mastery that went into the baking of our souffle. it came with a spiced choco sauce and cookie dough bites and fancy buncha crunch. it was delicious, just not my favorite.\n\ni also had a perfectly crafted cappuccino. \n\nin short.... can't wait to try the bev hills location.", 
            "once we were shown our table, our server  was right behind with the wine list and menu. awesome. my manhattan was made perfectly and my bf's dirty martini was made just dirty enough. we knew that scarpetta's known for their homemade pastas so that's what we focused on - we got the short-rib and <mark>Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti</mark>, duck and <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark>, lamb ragu fettucine and the brussels sprouts as main courses. the brussel sprouts were meh. the lamb ragu was good but the agnolotti and ravioli were amazing! had the grilled dover scallops for and appetizer and they were awesome and the bombalini with nutella were phenomenal. we were seated by the windows where you could watch the bellagio water show so that made the meal even more special.", 
            "is it just me or did i miss something? \n\nwe had a late dinner, and since raku was booked we opted to try here. it's romantic and intimate, but i left feeling disappointed. \n\n<mark>Braised Short Ribs of Beef</mark> - it was good, the short rib was braised well although a bit salty. i didn't really understand or like farro risotto. \n\nduck & <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark> - i like foie, but i just wasn't a fan of this. the texture reminds me of cow brains. it is also very rich. \n\nshort rib & <mark>Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti</mark> - this was ok, but nothing spectacular. it was also a bit rich, and the horseradish was a bit too much at times. \n\nmediterranean orata - the seared fish was good, but nothing too special. fish was almost too slimy. \n\nafter reading all these great reviews, i'm starting to feel like i missed something. i'm not sure if it's my palate or if the food is just overrated? everything i tried was really rich in flavor, and i left both pastas half finished. maybe i went in expecting too much? if anyone feels the same as, please let me know. i can't be the only person that feels this way right? \n\nservice was good, except the host looked like she wanted to go home badly.", 
            "i have been to the beverly hills location prior to the las vegas location and both were spot on. we made reservations and got there 45 minutes early to be promptly seated at the best table in the house! we had a beautiful view of the bellagio fountains. our waiter was very helpful and had great suggestions. the bread basket is always a favorite of mine. i especially like the marscarpone cheese spread. yummy!! we shared the apple endive salad with beets also good. i had the spaghetti this time and prior i had the <mark>Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti</mark> (super good). the ambience was top notch as was the service. i'll be visiting again.", 
            "i still dream about this place. \n\nmy boyfriend and i came here one evening in october for dinner. it was probably the best meal i have had in vegas. thankfully he made a reservation before, so we got seated with no problems. we were seated close to the window that overlooked the bellagio fountains. such a pretty sight!\n\nfor dinner, i got the short rib & <mark>Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti</mark>. it was heaven on earth! such a fresh and flavorful dish. and it was perfectly portioned! i don't remember the names of any of the drinks, but they were delicious and had fresh fruit as well! \n\nthe service wasn't the best, and the set-up seemed a bit cramped, but amazing food and ambiance! i'll hopefully be back when i am in vegas again!", 
            "as bad as docg was is as good as scarpetta was. i learned my lesson....don't be cheap. it is worth the extra money to eat here for sure. i went here with a friend as our first meal on her first trip to vegas. when you enter, the restaurant looks tiny... like a long hallway, and then when you get to the end it opens into a large restaurant with a big window overlooking the bellagio fountains .... so cool. i was worried that i would need to order a lot to get full and spend a ton of money.... not the case. we both ended up ordering the short rib and <mark>Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti</mark> and not only was it delicious but it was super filling. it was savory, had varying texture, and spiced perfectly... i loved every bite. that, in addition to their amazing bread basket (including 4 types of bread with some stuffed with cheese/meat/veg and 3 dips a whipped soft cheese spread, citrus olive oil, and eggplant), filled us up...awesome! we finished with the waiter recommended doughnut dessert.... i had one complaint about that dessert, either i missed it or they didn't tell us that one side of the plate was all nutella filled donuts and the other side was all vanilla... i thought the vanilla and nutella would be mixed...so when i was eating from one side and my friend was eating from the other side we were both confused where the other flavor was.... anyway, the nutella donut with the banana gelato was awesome, the vanilla...not so much. that was a pretty minor problem. our service was great and we each paid about 30$...not bad at all. will be back for sure.", 
            "mostly exceptional food, mostly forgettable service. \n\ni've been wanting to come here ever since seeing this place featured on food network's 'best thing i ever ate.' we came as a party of 5 to include my parents, 2 year old son and wife.\n\nwe came in and the hostess was less than friendly. she asked my name then took us to our table without a word. \n\nwe sat down and waited much too long for our waiter. this became a theme throughout the night. he finally came by and simply told us the daily special and asked what we wanted to drink. i've been to many upscale restaurants around the world, and this would be unacceptable at any of them. he didn't take any time to explain the menu, how people normally order, etc. \n\nthe menu was divided into courses which led me to believe people ordered many courses. however, with the price of each dish this would get prohibitively expensive quite quickly. i asked the waiter and pointed out that people ordered at most 2 dishes and that they were not family style. i'd expect the opposite with authentic italian.\n\nthe drinks took forever to come out, nearly being outpaced by our appetizers! we didn't order anything outrageous: 2 bourbons neat, 2 martinis and some milk. the bourbon list was one of the most extensive i've seen in a restaurant, mind you i just returned from 3 years in japan. \n\nour appetizers came out and were presented well. i ordered the <mark>Creamy Polenta</mark> into which the waiter scooped in fricasseed mushrooms. it had wonderful texture and taste; my wife hates polenta but loved it, even more than her butternut squash soup. it was ok, but had a chinese five spice taste to it we found off putting. the bread and spreads were good and my dad enjoyed his endive salad, despite the waiter giving it to my mom at first. again, at this price point, unacceptable!\n\nfor the main course three of us ordered the spaghetti with tomato and basil and one got the short rib / <mark>Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti</mark>. both were mind blowing: must haves. \n\ntwo of us got chocolate souffl\\u00e9 for dessert; i got the bombolonis and my mom got the <mark>Coconut Panna Cotta</mark>. the chocolate souffl\\u00e9 had that nasty five spice flavor to it again. gross! i was certainly not a fan. the bombolonis were a can't miss as they were filled with nutella, although the banana gelato was an awkward pairing.  the <mark>Coconut Panna Cotta</mark> was wonderfully fruity and refreshing. my mom got the best dessert for sure. \n\ni would come back here for the spaghetti, <mark>Coconut Panna Cotta</mark> and bourbon list, and hopefully we'd get a better waiter.", 
            "this review is for their happy hour only.\n\nwe arrived on a weekday around 6pm and the bar was pretty crowded but we were able to find a spot at the bar. all the cocktails and small plates they offer at happy hour were only $7, which was a steal. the <mark>Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti</mark> was absolutely delicious. based on this dish i really want to come in for dinner some time soon. perfectly seasoned and the texture was heavenly.  \n\nthe cocktails were great, too. strong l, but not too strong and really great flavors. the bartender was really personable and we ended up having a really great happy hour. i'll be back soon for dinner.", 
            "picture four girls who have been drinking all day downstairs at the marquee day club, starved out of their minds. not really the way i imagined myself dining for the first time at the famous scarpetta, but hey, at least i was ready to eat.\n\nwe c<mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> in in our flip flops and denim shorts right when the restaurant opened. the tables were already all booked (at 6pm!), but they have some nice booth seats by the bar. \n\nfirst off, the complimentary bread. my god. warm and chewy, stuffed with sausage or spinach and cheese, with olive oil for dipping. we had to get a second round of this, it was so fantastic. \n\nwe also shared four pastas:\n- spaghetti (with tomato and basil, that's it!)\n- duck & <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark>\n- pici (with lobster, tarragon, almond & chili pesto)\n- short rib & <mark>Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti</mark> (the toasted breadcrumbs added such a fabulous texture and crunch!)\n\nall the dishes were phenomenal, but the spaghetti was by far my favorite. typically spaghetti doesn't do it for me, but now that i know what it's supposed to taste like, i've changed my mind. so simple, yet so delicious. it was cooked perfectly al dente, and so rich and full of flavor i didn't even miss the creaminess (or cheesiness) of other pastas. \n\na must-visit if you're ever in vegas!",

            "i am a fan of scott conant from chopped fame but i have to say the las vegas outpost of his iconic nyc restaurant just did not live up to the hype.  i went with a group of guys and we ordered the tasting menu.  they were nice enough to allow us to order it on a friday night since it is usually not offered on that night of the week.  we tasted 8 dishes for $110 pp.  the quantity of food was great - really full at the end of the meal - but most of the dishes were just ok.\n\nthe real highlight for me was the <mark>Creamy Polenta</mark> with truffled mushrooms.  wow, that was delicious.  probably the creamiest polenta i've ever had and it paired so nicely with the earthiness of the truffles and mushrooms.   the <mark>Chocolate Cake</mark> served for the dessert course was also terrific, served with toasted almond gelato.  too bad i was so full by that time i could only have a couple of bites.  nothing else was particularly memorable.  \n\ndisappointing for me was the restaurant's signature spaghetti - a seemingly simple preparation of pasta, fresh tomatoes and basil.  it arrived very simply plated -  a perfect cylinder mold of spaghetti covered by a clear plastic cloche that i suppose is meant to preserve the freshness of the preparation or perhaps to concentrate the aroma.  the cloches are removed with a flourish releasing nice smells of tomato and basil.  the pasta was a bit overcooked and the sauce, while wonderfully creamy (how do they do that?) was just too sweet, as if chef conant and chef boyardee had a bastard love-child.\n\nanother disappointment was the <mark>Black Cod</mark>.  in the past i have found this fish to be among the most delicious owing to its high fat content and buttery texture and flavor.  scarpetta's rendition of this fish, pan-roasted with concentrated tomatoes and roasted fennel, was so overcooked that it was unrecognizable as <mark>Black Cod</mark>.  just a piece of fish.\n\nother dishes were a bit more successful including the <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> of <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> and tuna, the diver scallops, the short rib/<mark>Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti</mark> and the <mark>Spiced Duck Breast</mark>.\n\nthe wine list is voluminous and expensive.  the cocktail menu offers some nice selections.\n\nthere is certainly a lot of eye candy to be enjoyed at this swank place in the cosmo.  however, one annoying thing was the lighting.  over every table there is a large fixture containing multiple <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark>/gold colored lights.  this lighting casts the food in a weird color and makes taking pictures of the food impossible.  all the food looks bad in the pictures i took - i suppose that's no surprise that the pictures were a disappointment too.", 
            "this was a solid 5 star meal for me and my two friends this past weekend. firstly, our server was amazing. i'm a bit of a pain and he was patient and helpful and very professional. he had great advice, and was very understanding of my gluten allergy (and i was thrilled that they had a separate gluten free menu). every dish ordered was an 'oh wow you gotta taste this\" moment. my friends said the stromboli bread basket with the choice of marscapone butter, lemon olive oil and eggplant caponata kicked off the night. other standouts included the <mark>Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti</mark>, polenta with mushroom ragout and the <mark>Chocolate Cake</mark> with almond gelato and salted caramel. even the music was great. i had been hating being in vegas- the riff-raff, over-designed spaces,  overpriced fussy but mediocre food, but this restaurant redeemed the trip. note to the management- if you already have a gluten free menu why not put it on the website with the other menus?? i wish we had known about this place earlier.",

            "<mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> fail. \n\nthis was my girlfriend's first time in las vegas, so i wanted to bring her to an upscale place and have her try some food from supposedly exclusive restaurants in vegas. based on the <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> reviews, and time availability, i chose scarpetta. it was a major disappointment, and i felt so bad bringing her to this establishment. this was the first restaurant experience she had in vegas and it was horrendous. \n\nlet me say that this review is based on three dishes that we had at scarpetta. \n\n1. duck and <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark> (main course)\n2. <mark>Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti</mark> (main course)\n3. roasted diver scallops (appetizer)\n\nambiance:\n\nthe seating and view were great. we were the table almost next to the window where the belagio water show was going on. there was a great view of the show. the lighting was also dim. it is definitely a nice place to bring a date.\n\nprice:\n\ndespite the $$$, the prices are not too outrageous for las vegas. the main course dishes were 25 and 26 dollars while the roasted scallops were 23 dollars. \n\nservice:\n\nservice was horrible. we were there for over an hour. our waiter checked up on us twice, once to bring more water and the second time to see if our food was ready. we waited for about 15-20 minutes to get our scallop appetizer. no apologies or more complementary bread. the wait for the food seemed the norm, as the tables next to us finished their food and were just making small talk while waiting for over 20 minutes. after we finished our scallops, we proceeded to wait another almost 30 minutes for our main course. again, no apologies or further check ups. i ran out of water while waiting for our main course, during the appetizer, and did not get a refill until i had to ask for one (after the main course came). when we wanted to tell the waiter about the problems with our main courses, he and other waiters could not be found for about 20 minutes. we just sat there looking at each other and our plates (almost untouched). simply horrible.\n\nfood:\n\nscallops - these were actually very good. they were simple scallops that were fresh and cooked well. i would definitely get this again.\n\nduck and <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark> - came out cold, tough, and very very very salty. we have had foie gras before, and this was well beyond what it was supposed to taste like. it left a bitter and salty taste in the mouth that could only be drowned out by eating the complimentary bread with their house tomato sauce. my girlfriend did not want to waste food so she tried to put the ravioli in her mouth followed by water as a chaser. she soon became sick and had to go to the bathroom. she only finished about 1/3 of the plate before i told her to stop. \n\n<mark>Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti</mark> - gross. the noodles were tough and cold. the sauce made the bread crumbs stick to the noodles and caused the noodles to stick together like one giant pasta. i had trouble eating one bite of it. after finally taking a bit, the food was bland and left an unpleasant aftertaste. it was one of the worst dishes i have had in a long time. i am usually not too picky with pasta, but this agnolotti was inedible. the noodles were rubbery hard and the sauce was cold and crusted onto the noodles. the appearance did not help. the food looked like someone threw up on the plate. the sauce was black or very dark brown (could not tell because of the dim lighting), but the appearance made the food even less appetizing. \n\nconclusion of the meal:\n\nafter about 20 minutes of the food being on the plate, almost completely untouched, the waiter came by to ask \"how was everything tasting.\" i told the waiter that the food was inedible and that it was probably the worst thing i've had in recent memory. the waiter's face was priceless. he did not seem shocked at all, rather, he just appeared to be apologetic. the waiter took the food off our table and asked if we wanted anything else. at this point, the restaurant was about to close and we did not want to wait another 30 minutes to get some inedible food. i told him to just give me the check so we can get out of there. they took the two dishes off our bill and our almost 2 hour meal came out to a whopping $23 (for the scallops). what a waste of time and appetite.\n\nthis trend of inedible food was not isolated to only our table table. while waiting for our food, the table behind us asked for the check and had two dishes that were inedible and left untouched as well. i did hear that the fish was decent from the table behind us, but that was the extent of praise scarpetta's food received. \n\noverall:\n\ni felt the need to write a long rant about this place. this dinner was supposed to be a happy and memorable event for my girlfriend because it was her very first dinner in vegas. instead, it was only memorable because of how bad the restaurant service and food were. considering there are a ton of great great places in vegas, i would highly advise anyone to pass on scarpetta.", 
            "tucked away in the cosmo, this restaurant is intimate and has a great view of the bellagio fountain. i made reservations through opentable and it worked just fine. we even arrived a bit early but they had our table ready and were able to seat us right away. we had an awesome seat by the window across from the fountain and basically had dinner and a show. it was perfect. service was good, water was constantly filled, plates taken away and made sure we were doing okay. food was so-so... yes, i said it... it was just okay. i had the duck and <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark> and the bf had the <mark>Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti</mark>. i actually enjoyed his dish more than my own.. but both pastas were only okay. somewhat lacked flavor, or i just might be more of a tomato sauce kind of girl. i did however enjoy their assortment of bread and the butter, and other dipping sauces they had. that was delicious and we had to have two servings of that. we also had a caesar salad which was delicious and had a hint of lemon flavor that was refreshing.",

            "you know those few precious moments when you're absolutely falling in love with a dish? like your eyes roll back and you carefully savor each bite, wishing the experience will never end? it's an ecstasy that only a few restaurants can deliver. this describes my dinner experience at scarpetta, when i delicately pulled apart my fennel dusted spiced <mark>Black Cod</mark>. a bed of tomatoes and roasted fennel added a tangy zest to the fish. my lawd. this must be a dream. it's too good to be true!\n\nbam! snap back to reality. as i used my fork and knife to d<mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> piece of that tender cod to my mouth, i spotted a thin black line. hmm, that's an interesting lookin' spice. let me tug at it some more. lo and behold, it was a piece of hair, and it was definitely not mine. the hair was embedded in the cod's skin! i politely informed my waiter of the situation and he apologized, then asked if i would like to replace the cod with a different dish. i just wanted another cod. i wanted to return to that euphoria i was experiencing before my foodie world came crashing down on me when i discovered that unfortunate piece of keratin. \n\nlike forrest gump says, sh** happens. i understand that, but i'm at scarpetta. this is a high-caliber restaurant, one of the best in las vegas, owned by the famous chef scott conant. it's not something i would expect to happen here. my waiter was professional though, he quickly brought out another cod (since my partner was already done with his dish) and our dessert was on the house. i totally appreciate these gestures. yet, when my second cod arrived, it did not taste as heavenly as the initial one. i noticed that my second dish came out a lot faster than my first, which meant it was cooked in a shorter amount of time. the meat of my second cod looked a tad <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> it was almost rubbery in texture, not as moist and soft as my first one. there goes my foodie high. womp womp.\n\nthe kitchen staff probably invested less time and attention on my replacement dish. i know there was a slight rush to bring out my cod asap since my boyfriend already finished his entree. however, i was still paying for this dish and it was executed poorly compared to the first one. \n\nthis could have easily been a four or five star review. we asked for a table next to the window and the views of the strip and the bellagio fountains were stunning. so romantic and beautiful. my boyfriend and i started our dinner with the tuna \"susci\" with marinated vegetables and preserved truffles. this is essentially tuna wrapped around vegetables. it was almost like a sushi roll, but there was too much going on. we couldn't really tease out the tuna flavor.  \n\nmy boyfriend ordered the short rib & <mark>Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti</mark>. it's cooked in brown butter, horseradish, and toasted breadcrumbs. he said it was good but not amazingly tasty. he was still quite hungry after finishing his pasta. \n\nthe complimentary amedei <mark>Chocolate Cake</mark> with toasted almond gelato and salted caramel sauce was decadent. the chocolate was not overly sweet and the almond gelato was creamy.\n\nit wasn't purely the hair, but the fact that my second cod was unrecognizable compared to my first one. the rest of the items are pretty solid. the view is the best thing scarpetta has to offer. and maybe that <mark>Black Cod</mark>...when it is cooked properly.", 
            "we have eaten at scarpetta in new york and miami many times and it was simply fantastic. they let us down this time. pasta wasn't cooked very well. the <mark>Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti</mark> that we had in nyc might have been the best thing we have ever eaten. here it was just ok. filling was coming out of pasta and it was very chewy. hopefully they get it fixed.", 
            "four and half stars!! \n\ni love italian food and have been to many italian restaurants in town: piero's, fiamma, parma by chef marc, casa diamore, nora's, gantaeno's, lavo, carmine, roma deli, panevino, pasta mia, wolfgang puck pizzeria and etc. although i like certain dishes from some of previous listed restaurants but after dining here last night, i found my absolutely favorite italian in town. \n\nfood:\ni love love bread and omg, their bread was so amazing. the texture of the bread was perfect. the bread basket came with various bread; rosemary, cheese, white and etc. rosemary bread was crispy and fluffy. cheese one was chewy and flavorful. the  eggplant basil dipping sauce that came with it was incredible good. i even put some in the spaghetti.  \n\nappetizer \n1. scallop and foie gras (3/5): i have to say i was not impressed by their foie gras. scallop was not bad. grilled pear was interesting though. don't think i will order again.\n2: <mark>Creamy Polenta</mark>(4:5): ordered this dish because it's popular on <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark>. the truffle mushroom that came on top made this dish absolutely delicious. i would prefer polenta was not so liquidity. \n3: grilled spanish octopus and squid (5/5): it was light and fresh. love the smoked paprika vinaigrette and chickpea that came with it too. \n\nentrees\n1. spaghetti with tomato and basil(4/5): like other <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> said, they cook it al dente here. it was just simple and amazing. i added some eggplants from the dipping sauce :p.\n2. duck and <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark> (3.8/5): it was tasty in general but i couldn't taste much flavor from duck or foie. masala reduction and cheese saved the dish though. \n3. short rib and <mark>Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti</mark>(5/5): it was my favorite entree of the night. toasted breadcrumbs and brown butter made this dish so heavenly. \n4. branzino (3/5): my friend ordered this dish and he liked it. i tried a bite and it was too fishy for me.\n5. lamb loin (4:5): i do not eat lamb but tried a bite from my friends plate and it was not gamy. lamb lover should definitely give it a try. \n6. pici (4/5): great flavor. the tarragon and chilled pesto made this dish very yummy although i wish i see more lobster.  \n\ndessert\nall yummy across the board! \n1. banana souffl\\u00e9 (5/5): perfect amount of sweetness from the souffl\\u00e9 although i'm not a fan of rum gelato. \n2. <mark>Coconut Panna Cotta</mark> (5/5): very interesting concept with the guava juice as they called it \"soup\".\n3. citrus parfait (5/5): very refreshing after the meal. it's like yuzu sorbet.  \n\nservice was attentive but the service was not bit cold. i don't feel like our waiter was welcoming and patient enough. feel like he's there to do his job and leave. no smiles either. maybe he had a bad day. \n\ni will keep trying other italian restaurants but i can see myself coming back frequently.", 
            "i'm not a big fan of pasta because i usually try to avoid carbs. i see it as a waste of valuable tummy space that i should reserve for other food. but i have to give it to scarpetta for changing my mind.\n\nwe came here in a group of six on a sunday night. we made reservations like two hours prior, but we showed up about an hour early and were seated immediately. \n\nright away, we were impressed by the variety of the bread basket and the dips. i can't remember exactly but there were about six different types of bread. what really got our attention though was the eggplant dipping sauce! it was so yummy that we kept shamelessly asking for more. i think we got at least three refills of it (but hey, we had six hungry girls!).\n\non to the real food... my friend and i shared the lobster pici and the short rib and <mark>Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti</mark>. the pici is dressed with a chili pesto sauce, and since my friend can't eat spicy foods, they split the portion for us and served it on two separate plates. i got extra chili pesto on the side in case i wanted to add more. i loved that we didn't have to try and split our dish in half ourselves. so much more convenient and i can get straight down to eating! however, it turns out that the chili pesto sauce isn't even spicy at all. if anything, it's just salty, like really salty. the pieces of lobster meat still tasted good and wasn't that salty, but the pasta sat directly in the pesto and it definitely could've used less sauce/salt.\n\nnow on to the short rib and <mark>Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti</mark>... it was the last entree to come out! all the food came out already and the agnolotti was nowhere to be seen. we got sidetracked by the lobster pici and kind of forgot about our 2nd entree to share. when we realized, we asked the server where it was and if the kitchen had forgotten about it, but he assured us it will be coming out shortly. by the time it came out, everyone was done with their food. i'd say it came out 10-15 mins later than the other entrees. it wasn't so bad considering we were sharing another entree, but had we not shared, one of us would've sat there without food. considering this is a fine dining restaurant, that is unacceptable. \n\nbut you know what, it was so delicious that i didn't care it was late. i think this has become my favorite pasta dish of all time. the flavor was very rich and smooth, with a little crunchy texture from the garlic chips. i personally liked it better than the duck and <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark> that i tried from my friend's plate. i would order this again and again. luckily for me, there's also a scarpetta in ny! guess where i'll be going to dinner soon!", 
            "oh scott!! when is the last time you did quality control??? i'm a huge fan of yours as i love the food network.  i've been itching to try out scarpetta for a while and made it a priority during my vegas trip!!\n\nomg!  everything was bad.  i mean bad!!! the service was bad and lacking and the food didn't save the day either.  let's just say i'd expected much more from you and maybe a meal at olive garden would've been a better choice. there was absolutely no seasoning in all of the dishes and the focaccia bread was drowned in oil.  the saving grace is probably your specialty bread.  \n\nwe ordered the <mark>Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti</mark> and <mark>Crispy Fritto Misto</mark> as appetizers and both were mediocre at best.  for entrees i ordered the duck and fois <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark> and omg, i couldn't eat more than 4 pieces of it and i'm known to polish my plates.  my hubby had the octopus and it was ok but lacked seasoning again.  my daughter had your world famous tomato sauce pasta and the pasta was tough and needed salt!  is it a bad day or is it normally like this?\n\nhands down the worst meal in vegas.  huge disappointment!!!", 
            "wow...yummy!\n\ni had wanted to try out scarpetta having been a huge chopped fan and knowing i was going to be staying next-door in the bellagio. opentable didn't have a reservation available for that day and i thought i was out of luck. we happen to be at the cosmopolitan anyways and went upstairs to do a drop in... luckily they had a table for two with a fountain view and all!\n\ni can't say enough good things about the breadbasket it was amazing. the caponata i could've eaten 10 bowls. \n\nbut i wisely left some room for apps and the main. i had the beet and burrata salad. the dressing on the beets was tangy and the burrata very rich and smooth. it was also beautifully composed. my companion had the polenta. which was just as sinfully creamy as they said it would be.\n\nfor main i had the <mark>Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti</mark>. rich little pillows <mark>Braised Short Ribs of Beef</mark> heaven. and the breadcrumb crunch on top...perfect. and of course we had to try the famous spaghetti. there's a reason they're famous for it. sauce clings to the noodles and transports you to italy...get it.", 
            "we choose scarpetta for our 25th anniversary dinner which we booked in early january with hopes of sitting by a window overlooking the bellagio fountains but wound up to our disappointment sitting further back with a view of the building instead. but that was our only complaint. the food although not inexpensive was excellent. the fusion of flavors left you wanting more. we shared the burrata with beets, then the short rib with <mark>Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti</mark>. both excellent and topped the night with a very creamy and light souffl\\u00e9. they really know how to make espresso just like you get in italy. great service and delicious food made for a wonderful night.", 
            "solid. never knew how \"gourmet\" pasta could get, but yes it surely can to that level. believe it. \n\nentrees:\n<mark>Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti</mark>: this dish was perfection. the little ravioli-like pieces were well stuffed with flavorful short rib and the toasted breadcrumbs were the perfect topper. totally recommended.\nduck & <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark>: the richness of the filling makes it a dish to remember. c'mon it's foie gras! may be too fatty/heavy for one, but a delectable dish to share. \nspaghetti: took a bite of my friend's. pretty damn good for a traditional spaghetti dish, but it's really not like your mama's spaghetti at all. them al dente noodles were on point. \nchicken: chicken is just chicken, to me. wasn't particularly exciting.\nprime filet <mark>Braised Short Ribs of Beef</mark>: this was another item for our table. pieces of steak were cooked med-rare, which made the pieces juicy. good, but not \"steak-house good.\"\n\nthe desserts were shared were the grapefruit <mark>Coconut Panna Cotta</mark> and bombolini. both were so delicious! i'm typically hesitant about ordering fancy dessert, but these were worth it! \n\nin addition, we got the perfect view of the bellagio water show from our table. and to top it all off, our server (a mid-aged asian man) was incredible hospitable, genuine in his recommendations and considerate of our party's needs. the service really made it a great experience for our bachelorette's dinner. \n\nscarpetta, thanks for making our vegas trip a classy one.", 
            "we've walked by so many times and wanted to try this place out because of chef conant. in fact, last year, i asked my parents-in-law if they wanted to have dinner here but after looking at the prices, they decided against it, so we didn't.\n\na few weeks ago, i went back to vegas with my husband so we decided to check this place out, finally. we didn't have reservations so we weren't sure what was going to happen, but we got a corner seat for two. there's a dining room with views of the water show that we can kind of see from our seats. \n\nmy husband wasn't that hungry because we made the mistake of eating at a buffet earlier, so we didn't get an appetizer. i did get some red wine and so didn't my husband. they served us bread to start and it wasn't just any bread bowl, it was freshly baked bread and they were all delicious! i could have just eaten the bread and be happy about it. \n\nso we finally ordered and i got the short rib and <mark>Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti</mark>, it was topped with panko bread crumbs for a nice change of texture. i loved it. it was also very filling! i was really uncomfortable afterwards because of the buffet earlier. my husband got the gnocchis with foam, it didn't have flavor to the foam, just for presentation, i guess. \n\nwe didn't have room for dessert, but we'll come back and have it some time soon. it lost a star because we were seated in the corner there because we didn't have reservations, or so we were told. people who walked in and said they didn't have reservations were able to be seated in the dining room. please be consistent about it. you can tell us \"the dining room is currently full, you can wait for it to open up or we can seat you now in the corner, which would you prefer?\" instead, they just made the assumption and seated us. took away from the experience a bit, i'll be honest.\n\ni posted the photos on my instagram and chef scott conant liked it!!! then i posted a photo of him liking my photo and he liked that! yay!!! very cool! he seems like a cool guy and to top it off, a really great restaurant.",

            "scarpetta fits well in the sophisticated cosmopolitan hotel. tucked away into a corner, this restaurant is unassuming at first approach. the lights are dim and there are curvy booths on the right side facing a long bar. the walkway is narrow but keep the eye on the prize at the end because that's where the true \"meat\" of the restaurant is. tables and booths are snugly placed in a modern yet cozy dining area. for our group of 10, the broad shouldered guys probably felt a little too close for comfort to make room for all of us to fit, but it wasn't a problem for the girls. \n\nlast saturday, we were in a mad rush to eat and run because we were trying to catch a 9:30pm showing of ka at mgm. our dinner reservation was 7:30pm so we cut it close. we asked the waiter to divide our check between 5 couples and to make things worse, we did not sit next to our significant others. we brushed off the sommelier by accident because we wanted to find our waiter just to order right away. in spite of our group being a nightmare, they made our plans happen and with time to boot! the food was amazing, our checks were split perfectly, and the waiter even offered detailed directions how to get to our show quicker. \n\nthe duck fois <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark> and the <mark>Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti</mark> were the two dishes my husband and i shared. we loved these dishes. the guys in our group ordered steaks which were all well prepared and the girls ordered appetizers and a couple dishes to share but i think bry and i were the happiest out of the group with our choices, which is surprising because i always choose steak over anything. \n\nlooking back, i feel bad that we put the staff in a position where everything needed to be rushed but overall, our entire group was impressed with the food and service. thanks scarpetta for that!",

            "had a fantastic dinner at scarpetta on a thursday night.  i'd had reservations here on 4 previous occasions and had to cancel for one reason or another every time.  finally i was getting to try this joint.  we were seated immediately upon arrival.  the restaurant is larger than i was expecting, and if it wasn't full, it was very close.  lively atmosphere, almost loud, but not quite.  i wouldn't say it would be good for a romantic evening, but it was great for a night out with friends.\n\nour server immediately approached us and presented us with an impressive wine list.  it may not be the best i've seen on the strip, but it was well above average.  the prices are typical for a restaurant located in a higher end hotel on the strip, so you might have some sticker shock.  we went with a barolo which was fantastic.  service was great throughout the evening, no complaints at all.\n\nin addition to the wine list, we were brought the bread basket.  this has various types of bread, but the one that stood out had bacon and cheese.  it tastes as good as it sounds.  i might try to steal some the next time i eat there to make a sandwich with it the next day, it was great.\n\nto start, our table of 4 split 2 pastas:  the <mark>Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti</mark> and the ricotta cavatelli with wild boar ragu and arugula.  the waiter advised that they were small dishes, so we went with 2 orders of the agnolotti.  very glad we did, the amount we received was a perfect starter, but splitting the dishes among 4 would have been a stretch.  both pastas were cooked to a perfect al dente.  some of the best pasta i've had.  the short rib was very tender and flavorful, and the pasta to filling ratio was great.  likewise, the wild boar ragu was incredible.  rich and very deep flavors were seasoned perfectly.  i would be able to just eat a ton of this with a spoon, it was fantastic.  i'd even eat it cold.  \n\nto eat, i went with the special of the evening:  veal osso bucco with risotto.  the veal shank was large and fork tender.  full disclosure, a buddy of mine ordered this dish as well and his was not fork tender.  i saw him use a knife on more than one occasion throughout the meal.  mine, however, was fantastic.  the meat was moist and melted in your mouth.  it's not the best osso bucco i've had, that honor still goes to the might ferraro's, but it was an a dish for me.  the risotto was cooked well, but had a bit too much citrus for me.  but, i liked the dish enough to keep scarpetta at 5 stars.\n\nthis place isn't cheap, but you can find a lot higher prices on the strip and the food you get won't be worth the additional cost.  i had a great deal of anticipation for eating at scarpetta, and i was not let down.  i've found a new italian place for my rotation next time i'm in town.", 
            "just okay. \n\nperhaps i should have ordered that spaghetti that everyone raves about. \n\ni ordered the <mark>Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti</mark> instead. it was just okay. \n\nthe <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark> was just okay too.\n\nour table, however, was amazing. it overlooked the window with a view of the bellagio fountains. we got to see the water show several times during our meal. \n\noverall three stars."

            "bravo to scarpetta for an excellent dinner this past weekend.  we were lucky enough to sit at the \"chef's table\" and we had a clear view of the kitchen at work.  we even heard the chef shout out orders like hell's kitchen: one risotto, two <mark>Spaghetti</mark>; we had a party of 9 for a birthday and they treated us like kings.  the waiter titus was an amazing help and made the meal excellent.  the food that was prepared was spot on! i had the world-renowned plate of goodness known as the spaghetti, but let me tell you this is not your typical pasta dish.  the pasta was cooked perfectly al dente and the infusion of fresh tomato and basil all concentrated into the smooth pasta was a burst of flavor in my mouth.  for my appetizer i had the polenta that \"has been stewing in the kitchen prepared by grandma for three hours.\" it was amazing; the best polenta i have had topped off with a truffle sauce mixture with mushrooms.  for dessert, i recommend the <mark>Coconut Panna Cotta</mark>, like i say a great <mark>Coconut Panna Cotta</mark>'s consistency should jiggle like a nice woman's bosom and this dish jiggled perfectly.  the melt in your mouth dessert with a hint of coconut was a perfect end to a grand evening.  go here and try it over and over again because the spaghetti is addictive.", 
            "the ambiance and view of the las vegas strip was amazing! i've tasted so many different <mark>Spaghetti</mark> and the only spaghetti that i've ever liked is my moms and the one at scarpetta. the sauce was just a perfect taste. my sister had the <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark> and my other sister had the short rib and <mark>Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti</mark> which both dishes were amazing. the food came out in less than ten minutes. the waiters were very attentive."

            "one of the best dining experiences in vegas to date.\n\nto start off i must say that our waiter, matt, was amazing.  he was so knowlegeable, friendly, and answered all of our questions.  he really knew the menu well and could give reccomendations with amazing detail.  i loved the staff here.\n\nno joke, that bread basket with trio of citrus infused olive oil, eggplant spread and mascarpone butter...is to die for!  i could live off the stromboli filled with salami and smoked mozzarella.  so delicious.\n\nas a starter, i tried the <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark>.  the presentation was simple and clean with four thin slices of <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> topped with olio di zenzero, microgreens and sea salt.  it was so simple but you could taste the freshness.\n\nfor my next course, i ordered the short rib agnolloti.  perfection.  the brown butter and horseradish sauce was flavorful and had the right amount of kick to pull the dish together.  it was a very small portion but was perfect for a light dinner before going out.  my friends ordered the spaghetti with tomato and basil, <mark>Black Tagliolini</mark>, and orata rossa.  they all enjoyed their meals and the experience at scarpetta.\n\nour amazing waiter matt, surprised our table with a birthday plate of an assortment of italian cookies which were an amazing finish to a great meal.\n\ngreat ambiance, view of the bellagio fountain, service, food...overall an amazing dinner!!", 
            "i've been to scarpetta lv 3 times so far. great bread basket, \"more stromboli please!\" recommend the spaghetti. which is strange because i never order spaghetti when dining out, this ones special though. <mark>Black Tagliolini</mark> was delicious and some pasta filled with short ribs, i forget the name of it but it's different and probably isn't like anything you've had before. order and share the dry <mark>Prime Aged Sirloin</mark> to accompany your pasta. it's a perfect fit, especially with the spaghetti.\n\ndessert? skip it. had em all and not one i would order again, and by this point you'll have spent enough money.  thought about giving scarpetta 3 stars, not because of food but because of price, e.g. \"the handmade in house pasta\" spaghetti is $24. but i had to take into consideration of the convenience of being located on the strip and that location with it's great fountain views cost money.", 
            "came here for a nice dinner after watching o. i really liked both the food and ambience at scarpetta. since it was after the show, we walked in without a reservation and were able to get seated by the window. \n\nwe shared the duck & <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark> and the <mark>Black Tagliolini</mark> with a side of mushrooms. i liked all 3 dishes - even though you can't really taste the foie in the ravioli. the waiter told me they normally have a seared foie in the fall, but this year it wasn't here yet in october =( sad times. the mushrooms were really good! and i liked the black taliolini a little more than the ravioli. overall, a great experience at a fairly reasonable price for vegas standards.", 
            "one of the best meals of my life, with a spectacular view of the bellagio fountain show. we started out with cocktails & enjoyed the variety of complimentary bread served with citrus olive oil, eggplant caponata & mascarpone butter. we chose the lardo wrapped p<mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> as our appetizer which were served with rosemary lentils & it was very flavorful. i had the <mark>Black Tagliolini</mark> pasta for my entree which was lightly dressed with a cream sauce & topped with dungeness crab, uni & tobiko. i told the server's assistant who removed my empty dish that, had i been alone, i would have licked the plate...it was that good. i lived in italy for several months & had some great pasta, but never anything that spectacular. my date had the lamb trio which was filet, sausage & chop over ceci beans & baby carrots topped with hazelnut. he requested the chop cooked medium rare but it was served rare. the server quickly took it back for a re-fire & it was perfectly cooked upon its return. we enjoyed the nutella & vanilla bomboloni for dessert which was served with chocolate shortbread crumble & banana gelato. the only issue i had was that our server was a little aloof & cold, but it was late & i believe we were his last table so i understand. it really did nothing to detract from my fantastic experience at scarpetta & his assistant, guy with a beard & long hair (cute!), made up for it with his kind conversation. can't wait to return for another meal here!"

            "scarpetta is at the newly opened cosmopolitan hotel in las vegas and we dropped by on a whim and are glad we did.  this turned out to be a sensational dining experience.  every single morsel of food that passed our lips was a taste sensation.  we started out with the seared sea scallops, the chestnut soup and the beet salad.  each was out of this world delicious!  our entrees consisted of the <mark>Black Cod</mark> which was buttery and perfect, the sicilian <mark>Spiced Duck Breast</mark> which was tender and tasty and the duck and <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark> which was creamy and sensational.  we ended our dinner with two desserts and i would highly recommend the <mark>Coconut Panna Cotta</mark> guava soup with carmelized pineapple.  double-yum!  service was outstanding and although we did not have have a table with a view overlooking the las vegas strip, we enjoyed our comfortable booth with room enough on the table for all the dishes we ordered. i would definitely want to return to this restaurant again and would highly recommend it to everyone.", 
            "so much potential here, the experience was really 3 star but i'm optimistic.\n\ngreat layout with large s-curved bank seating and a nice north facing view of the bellagio fountain. service is great but the kitchen timing needs work. food came out a bit slow and a bit cold which is normally a big time no-no but they are new and working out the kinks.\n\nfood is delicious, apps of short ribs and polenta truffles with mushrooms make for a great start. polenta was creamy and truffle accents were spot on. \n\npastas are house-made and cooked just al-dente. easy to do but somehow few places get it right. the spaghetti with creamy tomato and basil, just perfect, a great representation of italian food in its simplistic goodness. <mark>Black Cod</mark> done well, cooked nicely. \n\nduck and <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark> was a bit salty and cold and the agnolotti seemed too one dimensional. both were slightly warm and would have been better paired with a side. plates seemed a bit bare.\n\ndesserts-  very creative. napoleon-  deconstructed creme brulee with blood oranges, sweet and creamy, amazing combination. \n\nnutella warm molten chocolate bites with hazelnuts were also deliciously comforting. \n\noverall, given the lack of decent italian eateries with value on the strip, it's worth a visit. once they get the timing down, the kitchen and the service make this a sure-bet for a quality meal.", 
            "i had heard about scarpetta multiple times on travel channel (anthony bourdain) and food network (best thing i ever ate).  scott conant is also a celebrity chef that is on some food network shows.  i happened to be at a conference at the cosmopolitan (my new favorite hotel in vegas, btw), and i figured i might as well stop by and try out the food at scarpetta.\n\nthe inside of the restaurant has a good view of the faux lake at the bellagio.  big windows and a nice decor are the first thing you notice.  the food is what we were really there for, so i was excited about that.  for appetizer, we ordered duck and <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark>'s with a wine reduction sauce.  this was just amazing....heavy and rich, but it is foie gras, so you should expect that.  since it was a regular menu item and not an appetizer, they split it in half for my co-worker and i.\n\nupon receiving the raviolis, our server (who was very good....attentive and knowledgable) brought over a basket of 3 breads.  one was ciabatta, one was a focaccia (or something similar) with pork (prosciutto, maybe?) and cheese rolled into it.  i can't remember the third bread, but it was also good.\n\nnext up was the main meal.  i ordered the spaghetti (with tomato and basil), and my co-worker ordered the branzino.  the spaghetti is what i had seen featured multiple times on tv, and i am always a skeptic.  i didn't think it could possibly be the best spaghetti i had ever had, but i was wrong.  this spaghetti was the absolute best i have ever had.  there was so much flavor concentrated on fresh pasta.  every bite was heaven, and for $24, i would order it again for sure.  vegas (and ny) are both expensive for nice restaurants, so the price tag is high compared to your local favorite italian place, but the pasta just isn't the same.\n\nmy co-workers branzino was also excellent.  served with some greens and onion, it was cooked perfectly (crispy skin), and the flavor was very fresh.  \n\ni can't say enough about this restaurant.  i highly recommend anyone going to the cosmopolitan check this place out.  definitely one of my better dining experiences for italian food.", 
            "wow. this place is pretty expensive, but it is worth every penny. \nthe service was spot on. everything you would expect where you'll spend about $100+ per person on dinner. \nportions are small (well actually portions are normal size, they just seem small compared to most other places that try to impress you with mediocre food by giving you a lot).  \nfor starters we had scallops - very good, cooked perfectly.  seared perfectly for a nice crunch, and tender on the inside. and we had the <mark>Creamy Polenta</mark> with truffled mushrooms. wow, the polenta was full of flavor, and the truffled mushrooms were amazing. one of the best things i have ever ate. \nwe also had a pasta course (cannot remember what it was called), but it was almost like a ravioli and was stuffed with a meat puree of chicken and veal. the texture was super creamy, like a pate. this pasta was amazing.\nwe also had the duck and <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark>. even more amazing than the previous pasta. tender pasta, the sauce was perfect, and the duck and foie gras was in a perfect balance. \nfor our main course we had 2 orders of <mark>Veal Loin</mark> wrapped in pancetta and served with sweetbreads and roasted vegetables. let's just say there was nothing left on my plate. \nnext we had dessert.  tiney doughnuts (zepolle) filled with nutella and served with cream anglaise. i was so full, but managed to eat every one. we also had the cheesecake. which was very very good. \nthis place will not disappoint. but you will spend some money. our bill was 300 after tip, an we did not have any alcohol. add a bottle of wine and it would have been about a 400 meal.  but no regrets. i'd go back as often as i could afford to.", 
            "my friends and i were seated with a view of the bellagio fountains and it was great! service was good. \n\nthe 4 different types of bread were really good. i had to stop myself or i wouldn't have room to eat my main course. \n\ni had the duck and <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark>. the pasta was cooked perfect and the filling was rich but a little too salty for me. the wine reduction added a good balance to the pasta.\n\nbut the star is definitely the spaghetti. it had an amazing flavor with a slight bite that goes very well with the perfectly cooked pasta. \n\nthe amedei <mark>Chocolate Cake</mark> was delicious! it was a perfect balance of richness and decadence for a <mark>Chocolate Cake</mark>. \n\nmy biggest disappointment was the soda drinks. i asked if they had other soda options besides fountain like gus and dry sodas but scarpetta doesn't. i asked for a ginger ale. without notification and with my assumption that fountain drinks are unlimited refills, i had 4 tiny glasses of mostly ice and maybe 4 oz of soda. my soda bill was $16. i had the waiter removed the extra charges.\n\noverall, it was a great restaurant with good food, service, and view. i'll try it again but look at other drink options.", 
            "la pasta perfetto!\n\nsometimes the simplest things can be magical when executed perfectly.  this is the case with scarpetta, scott conant's debut into the las vegas restaurant scene.  \n\nthe decor is understated and classy, in shades of black, white and gray.  a knowledgable and unpretentious waitstaff makes the experience all that much better, as they walk you through the menu.  a few tables along the wall rest next to big windows which overlook the neon shimmer of the strip below.  if you're coming here with a small group, definitley request one of these tables.  \n\nadesso, il cibo  (now, the food)\n\n<mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> carpaccio -  four paper-thin slices of <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> treated with fine olive oil and a bit of garlic.  high quality fish and a gentle hand made this appetizer balanced and elegant.\n\nwaygu beef tartare - diced  waygu beef treated in a similar fashion to the <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark>, but with a more pronounced garlic note at the end.  very straightforward and satisfying.\n\nspaghetti marinara - as many have said, this is the best spaghetti you will ever eat.  the housemade al dente spaghetti is toothsome and tender.  somehow, the chefs here are able to pull the purest essence of tomato and basil out in this dish.  the simultaneous subtley and complexity of the flavor profile here is truly incredible.  i've spent a lot of time in italy, and honestly cannot think of a spaghetti that holds a candle to this masterpiece.  a must order!\n\nblack mac n' lobster - i believe the <mark>Black Cod</mark> of the noodles comes from squid ink, but i could be mistaken.  very nice flavors of lobster and the sea.  the texture was quite similar to the spaghetti, which i found to be redundant, but that was an error in my ordering, and nothing to do with the execution of the dish.  \n\nduck and <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark> w/ marsala reduction - the food that kings eat!  the ravioli was immaculate, formed with care and the love you'd expect from a homemade italian meal.  i found the combination of duck, foie gras, and the marsala reduction to be a bit too heavy.  i could see people raving about this dish, but for me it was just too much of a good thing.\n\nbranzino - gentle white fish with a lightly crisped skin and honest flavors.  one of the best cooked fish plates i can remember having.\n\ndry aged filet - the pink/gray color of this steak is visually contradictory to what you might find at a fine steak house, but that is due to the dry aging process.  it was tender, flavorful, and neat.\n\n\nyes the bread is incredible as well, but let's not fill up on bread.  scarpetta is a great date spot if you're looking to splurge.  do not leave without ordering the spaghetti, its the type of dish you'll tell your grandkids about.",

            "first off, i would have to say scarpetta's service is impeccable.  if we could just rate our waiter alone, we would give him a 5 star rating!  he was knowledgeable, friendly, and humble.  i have seen far too many waiters in vegas who don't care, or are extremely snooty because my husband and i look young even though we're not.  \n\nas for the food, we order the scallops as the appetizer, and the duck and <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark> and the spaghetti as our entree.  for the scallops-i feel that it was good-but i have had better.  the duck and <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark> is their stand out dish!!  the wine reduction and marsala sauce on top of the ravioli made it so delicious.  the actual ravioli themselves are shaped like triangles.  i can tell there that is this delicacy to the outside when they were making it.  the duck and foie gras inside is very unique, and not like anything my husband and i have tasted before.  this dish deserves a 5 star.  finally, for the spaghetti.  i was extremely excited to try this dish because i read all these reviews on <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> explaining that it was amazing.  however, we were a little disappointed maybe because we were expecting so much.  don't get me wrong-the pasta is still good.  however, it's not the amazing that it was made out to be.\n\noverall, if i could give scarpetta a 4 1/2 stars, i would.  my husband and i will definitely be back if when we go back to vegas.", 
            "i have to say i indulged in almost every meal in my 4 day stay in vegas, but this was by far the best. the most decadent, delicious, and just memorable. \n\nat the tables in cosmo friday afternoon we were pondering where to have a late dinner before hitting the clubs. the player to my left said scarpetta had an amazing, but simple spaghetti dish that was to die for. keeping our fingers crossed, we wandered upstairs around 6:30 and were able to secure a 9:30 reservation and requested a tiny 2 person table in the corner with a great window view. even though we were running about 15 minutes late, they were gracious enough to hold the table for us. \n\nupon arrival, we didn't even have to give our name and check in, the host immediately remembered us from 3 hours earlier and sat us promptly at the requested table. the view of the bellagio and the water show was fantastic! the only issue i had was that we were not given a menu or even a wine list for at least 10-15 minutes after we were seated. normally this wouldn't be a problem i presume, but it was 9:30 and we were pretty much starving at this point. \n\nafter we were presented with menus though, the bread basket pretty much had our full attention for a good while. the selection of bread and spreads was delicious. we literally ate almost all of it...the focaccia was incredible. i ordered a gin and tonic, and my friend a glass of moscato. they were both delicious with our meals. \n\nwe shared the beef carpaccio appetizer, and it was absolutely delicious--just the perfect amount for 2 people to share since we weren't looking to eat a heavy meal, but wanted to try a starter. we shared 2 pasta dishes--the spaghetti everyone raves about and the duck and <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark>. personally i absolutely savored the ravioli--i love foie gras and duck, so it was perfect. the spaghetti my friend liked more--it was simple, but good. \n\ndefinitely coming back here on my next trip to vegas in may!",

            "scarpetta is located on the 3rd floor of the cosmopolitan hotel.  you can either take the escalator or the elevators up.  if you do take the escalator to the 2nd floor, the escalator to the 3rd floor is around the corner not immediately next to it.  \n\nthey have a bar area if you can't get a reservation.  \n\nthey dim the lights.  the setting is nice and elegant.  the wine cellar is a whole wall of the restaurant.  we sat next to the wine cellar wall.  if you sit next to the window, you can get a view of the bellagio water fountain. \n\nthe complimentary bread basket was extraordinary.  it consisted of ciabiatta, foccacia, homemade stromboli w/salami + smoked mozarella,  the stromboli was warm and reminded me of pizza. =)  it came with condiments of citrus infused olive oil, eggplant tapenade, and a mascapone butter.  \n\nusually when the wine list is that extensive, we ask the waiter for recommendations.  he asks questions like would you like red or white...light, mildly bold, or bold.  we chose bold...which was the chianti...and sure enough it was very bold in flavor.  it comes in a glass flask.  this is to let the wine breathe before serving.  then they pour the flask into your glass.  they make sure that the wine arrives at the optimal temperature.  \n\nour first appetizer arrived...the braised short ribs comes on a bed of risotto with shavings of parmesan cheese on top.  since they knew we were sharing, they split the portion so that we had our own pretty half of braised short ribs.  if they hadn't done that we may have fought over it.  deep flavors, tender ribs, and perfectly cooked risotto tickled our palates.  we enjoyed it so much that we asked the waiter for another menu to try more appetizers. \n\nwe ordered the tuna scusi (which was recommended by the waiter) and the sea scallops.  the waiter came back to inform us that our entrees were already fired up...if we would want the rest of the appetizer to arrive before the entrees...or if it was okay that the entrees arrived and then to have the newly ordered appetizers..  we told him that whatever was done first was fine.  but that shows that they take enough care in serving their food to notify us.\n\nthe sea scallops were equally savory.  it was seared to perfection with several different types of mushrooms.  there was also a sunchoke sauce on the plate that tasted like a deep cream of mushroom sauce (but its different...but the closest flavor that i can think of..).\n\nthe tuna scusi was not as impressive, not because it was not a good appetizer.  it was like sushi...vegetables inside with thinly sliced tuna instead of seaweed wrapping the vegetables.  it wasn't bad but it just didn't have the wow factor of the previous two appetizers. \n\nnow on to the entrees...\n\nfirst we had the duck and <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark>.  adorable little triangular pillows of ravioli drizzled with a brown sauce.  do not be deceived with the small ravioli, these packed a punch of flavor.  hubby said that this dish worth coming for.  course he also laughed saying that there was a scarpetta location in beverly hills.  pasta bliss!\n\nwe also had the spaghetti with tomato and basil.  i read about this spaghetti so i had to try it for myself.  why was this spaghetti better than most spaghetti??  well, my answer came when i took the first bite, the spaghetti tasted like chinese hand pulled noodles!!! \n\nno one else has said that...but the spaghetti really did taste like chinese hand pulled noodles.  if you are familiar with it, you would know that the noodle is chewy and must be cooked al dente (example: like jia jiang mein).  it's chinese hand pulled noodle with an italian flavoring.  now you know. *wink*\n\nthere was no room for dessert.  the waiter commented that we did well since we devoured everything...two bread baskets w/condiments, three appetizers, and two entrees.  each dish had great presentation.  we stared at each plate for a couple seconds since it was \"too pretty to eat\"...before taking the first bite. \n\noh, this meal was worth it.  the bill arrived and was less than we expected also.\n\nfood -- 5 stars\npresentation -- 5 stars\nservice -- 5 stars", 
            "good food at high prices.  that's ok by me.\n\nhave to give a big thumbs up to our server.  not enough of a thumbs up to remember his name, unfortunately.  looks like the asian guy in the last rambo movie.  think he's on the mentalist or one of those types of shows.  he gave it to his straight ie. this dish is no good and try this.  always appreciated as long as you know what you're talking about.\n\nduck and <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark> - despite being a foodie i am not big on the foie.  but this was a nice, rich, delicate dish.  a bit overpowering on the foie if you ask me but maybe i'm sensitive to that flavor.\nscallops - friends thought it was great.  i don't like scallops.\nsteak tartare - pretty darn good.  believe it was a kobe beef tartare.  nice beefy flavor (durrrr) though the accompaniments could have been better.  no toast points, no creamy sauce, no capers, eggs, etc.  seemed a tad plain.\n<mark>Spiced Duck Breast</mark> - waiter warned me against this as he thought it has too much cumin.  the cumin smell was indeed higher than even master yoda's midiclorian count but it's fate was not clouded by cumin taste.  the taste was strong with this one and more powerful than the waiter could ever imagine.  if anything, the cumin scent gave the dish focus, made it stronger.  (yes i like star wars)\n\nbig thumbs up to the bread basket.  there was one with salami or some sort of cured meat with it.  yummy.  not sure the marscapone butter was any better than normal butter but it was goody goody.", 
            "the best dining experience ever! scott conant's sophisticated yet soulful dishes were nothing short of decadent. started off with the short ribs; then the duck and <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark> (our favorite--so good!); i had the <mark>Spiced Duck Breast</mark>, and my hubby had the halibut. halibut was delicious! my duck had a little too much star anise in the rub. ended with the napoleon, so yummy, i cleaned the plate. we sat right next to a window and had a great view of the bellagio water show. had a wonderful time!\n\nand the service was impeccable! the staff was very professional and friendly. according to our receipt our waiter was asato. great guy. next time i hope to catch chef scott there!", 
            "i must admit, my expectations were somewhat low for scarpetta, as i usually find the las vegas outposts of famous restaurants to be more about decor and overpriced menus, and less about food.  i was glad to be proven wrong.\n\nalthough scarpetta definitely delivers in the \"las vegas hip\" decor, with a gorgeous dining room that has a glass-enclosed wine cellar on one wall, and floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking the bellagio fountains on the other, it also delivers on the food front.\n\nat the waiters recommendation, my group of three decided to share a primi (app) and pasta, and order our own entrees.  before our first course came out, we were brought fresh bread basket which i can honestly say was the best bread i've ever had.  a mix of rosemary ciabatta, focaccia, and this to-die-for bread that had salami and mozzarella in it.  the accompaniments of olive oil, eggplant spread, and mascarpone butter were equally satisfying.  here is a by-dish review:\n\nheirloom tomato salad w/ stracciatella, salsa verde & marinated eggplant:  this dish was good, if not a bit common.  it seems so many restaurants have an heirloom tomtato & burrata dish, that if you've had one, you've had them all - although i was happy to learn that stracciatella is an equally awesome burrata-style cheese.\n\n<mark>Creamy Polenta</mark> w/ fricassee of truffled mushrooms: hands down the best polenta anyone at our table had ever had.  it was so creamy and rich, and went great with the mushrooms which were served from a separate pot.\n\nduck & <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark> w/ marsala reduction:  this dish was very well received by the two people in my party who'd never had foie gras.  i am a huge fan of foie, and found the dish to be lacking the richness that usually comes when it's served on it's own - but overall a great dish.\n\npancetta-wrapped <mark>Veal Loin</mark> w/ sweetbreads, peas & carrots: the <mark>Veal Loin</mark> was my favorite dish of the night.  i am used to having sweetbreads battered and fried, so it was interesting to have them in a more natural state - small chunks cooked and mixed in with the vegetables.\n\nzeppole w/ nutella center, vanilla sauce & candied hazelnuts: wow - we were blown away by how good this dessert was.  little chocolate donut holes filled with nutella - yum.\n\ni will say that their wine list leans towards the expensive side, with only a few bottles in the $60 - $70 range.  we ordered the castello di bossi chianti classcio riserva berardo, which was $105 (retails for $30) - a good wine, but a bit pricey.", 
            "wow this place was really good. as much as i love trying restaurants that they dont already have in la (pretty new), id heard about scarpetta when i was visiting ny so we decided to check it out. \n\ni had the duck & <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark> which ws delicious! a real winner! they were so flavorful that even john (notorious for his 5 minute meals)  was forced to eat slowwwly.\n\ni also ordered the sea scallops- so juicy!  & the veal was alright, nothing to write home about.\n\ni wish i had known to request the table with the views of the fountain! we were sitting by the wall, but that was ok.\n\ni would definitely come back, this place is one of the better restaurants in lv at its price point.", 
            "my dining experience here was out of this world. the interior of the restaurant was absolutely beautiful, with modern & elegant tables & lighting.  we started off with the wagyu beef tartare and the <mark>Creamy Polenta</mark> with truffled mushrooms. the polenta was unbelievably creamy and luxurious!  then my friends and i ordered the tagliatelle, duck & <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark>, <mark>Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti</mark>, and colorado lamb loin done medium rare. everything was delicious, especially the lamb. the best part of the night was surprisingly the stromboli that was part of the bread basket at the beginning of the meal - buttery, fluffy slices of bread that was stuffed with salami & cheese. i am going back just for that bread!", 
            "cutting edge italian food presented beautifully in the perfect contemporary setting of the cosmo.  \n\nscarpetta's food is about building and layering flavors from a few ingredients to produce a harmonious dish.\n\nfor starters, <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> best.  the tuna \"scusci\" is excellent.  the tartness of the marinated veg pairs perfectly with the fish.  the <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> dish, with its pure simplicity brings out all the subtle sweetness of the fish.  finally the wagyu tartare.  wow, the use of the hazelnuts and parmigianino cheese creates a totally unexpected flavor!  \n\nfor pasta, its gotta be the duck and <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark>.  other <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> said they loved it.  it really is good.  the pasta is perfectly cooked and works well with the sweetness of the marsala reduction.\n\ntop mains include the branzino with pine nuts and green garlic gremolata that totally brings out the naturally nutty flavor of the fish and the pancetta wrapped <mark>Veal Loin</mark>, served with sweetbreads.  the flavors are very subtle and absolutely delicious.\n\nthe wine list is very good with a nice balance of italian wines (not just super tuscans).  vintage depth is ok.  prices are in line with vegas resorts.\n\nservice is very efficient.\n\noverall prices are very good for a restaurant of this caliber.\n\nrecommended.", 
            "we had great seating next to the windows viewing the bellagio fountains as requested.\nthe food was much better presented and tasteful than other italian restaurants i've visited in lv.\n\nthe bread basket is delightful with the trio of accompaniments: marscapone butter, eggplant in tomato ragu and citrus infused oil.  for appetizer we had the <mark>Creamy Polenta</mark>. enough for one or two to share as it is extremely rich as a separate duo of perfectly creamed polenta and truffled mushrooms. if you haven't already gobbled up your breads, make useful tool to sweep up the last juices.\nthree of us got the <mark>Black Cod</mark> which is superbly moist and light with a crisp skin, but the vegetables (fennel/peppers) were a bit too sour to match with.  and the other three got the <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark> which was rich and poignant with flavor but not unpleasant. the balsamic glaze was apparent and not overwhelming. i would have finished the entire plate.  \n\nwhy the three stars? lack of consistent service :(\ni don't include the guy who kept our water glasses filled. but we were all (party of 6) sourly disappointed with the main waiter. he only presented himself to take our order and serve the appetizer.  didn't even refilled our breads as asked.  then with empty plates, we all sat there for 15 minutes watching our server chummy up with a table of 3 girls and another table drinking it up with ample wine bottles. an assistant manager in a suit, bless him, came over, asked how our dinner was, saw our plates and decided to clear our table himself and also bring us our check.\nalthough we weren't completely dissatisfied with the whole dining experience, it's just unsettling when the server is mia with you and present elsewhere. \nso, maybe next time. if there is a next time.", 
            "i went here on a very specific mission: duck & <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark>. i barely even glanced at the menu - all i needed was confirmation that the ravioli was still there. and while it took awhile to get to the point where i got to finally eat the ravioli, it did not disappoint (an oh-so-divine 5 stars).\n\nwhen we arrived, we were promptly seated. however, we were actually seated more in the bar area than the actual restaurant area (which appeared to have a decent view). where we were seated was ok, though. it was a curved booth that had a very private feel to it. but it was near impossible to take in and experience the ambiance where seated.\n\nour server was nice and knowledgeable. i stated what i planned on eating and he was able to recommend a glass of wine to pair with it. however, when our food arrived, there was no ravioli. i had been delivered some other duck dish instead. having to send it back and sit there while the others i was with completely finished their meals was quite awkward. and while the server who actually delivered the food apologized, our main server, who took our order, said nothing. \n\nthe whole mix-up experience seemed very un-vegas. no apologies, no \"dessert is on us\", no nothing. i honestly felt treated like i was the one who screwed up (despite being very clear on what i wanted - and it was my sole purpose in dining here - and having witnesses who can vouch to what i ordered).\n\nso despite the ravioli being a home run, i have to deduct stars for the rest of the experience. \n\nbut omg the ravioli is beyond fantastic. i literally sat there and considered ordering a 2nd helping. move over mario batali - your beef cheek ravioli now has some serious competition. in fact, the duck & <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark> at scarpetta may actually be better than b&b's beef cheek ravioli. i'm going to have to that 2nd helping in order to confirm, but i may indeed have a new favorite vegas dish.\n\nso yeah, fab food, but not-so-hot first dining experience.", 
            "scarpetta is classy, modern restaurant. the main dining room gives you a great view of the bellagio fountain and is a great place to take a date. i have to mention that the music was perfect. it was swanky downtempo electronic music. awesome. \n\ni love beef tartars...especially the korean/japanese yuk-hoe, so as an appetizer, i decided to order the wagyu beef tartare and for dinner i ordered the famous <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark>.\n\nthe server brought out an assortments of bread to soothe my appetite. there was sourdough, french bread, rosemary bread, and stromboli. the bread came with a trio of butter, tomato-herb salad, and a lime-infused olive oil. the stromboli was the bomb.\n\nthe beef tartar came out next and i was extremely underwhelmed by it. the meat lacked flavor and the side salad was too salty. there is also a cured egg in it, which i did not taste at all. i did like the hazelnut garnish tho. all in all, 2/5 stars for this dish. \n\nfinally, the <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark> came out and it did not disappoint. they were small pockets of ravioli stuffed with a mixture of duck liver and duck confit, all topped with balsamic vineger and scallions. the pasta was fresh and incredibly delicate. it was one of the best pasta dishes i've ever had. my only knock on it was that i was not full at all. 4.5/5 stars.", 
            "my husband and i recently celebrated our anniversary at scarpetta and were seated by the window overlooking the bellagio fountains. very romantic. \n\nas much as i tried to save room for the main meal, the bread basket with an assortment of carbs along with mascarpone butter, roasted eggplant spread, and lemon infused olive oil was too hard to resist.  i even asked for a refill of the rosemary focaccia, it was that good. \n\nwe ordered the following:\nappetizer: \n*roasted sea scallops- 2 perfectly cooked giant scallops that melt in your mouth. \n\npasta: \n*duck and fois <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark> in a marsala reduction\n*spaghetti with tomato and basil\nboth dishes were fabulous and i highly recommend both.  i would easily order either dish upon my return visit. \n\nmeat:\n*pancetta-wrapped <mark>Veal Loin</mark>- with sweetbreads and vegetables\n*halibut with vegetable puree\nagain, both were delicious but if i were to come again, i would definitely order the halibut over the <mark>Veal Loin</mark>.\n\ndessert:\n*napoleon- creme brulee, macadamia tuilles, blood orange sorbet\n*<mark>Chocolate Cake</mark> with toasted almond gelato and salted caramel sauce\nboth were decadent, but i personally preferred the <mark>Chocolate Cake</mark> more mainly because the salted caramel sauce was divine.  if i could order just a bowl of salted caramel sauce, i would in a heartbeat. \n\nwhen you dine here, you will not be disappointed.  the servers are attentive and friendly.  the food is excellently prepared. i can't wait to come back and try other items.", 
            "i know this is an italian restaurant and we really came here for the spaghetti but what blew me away was the bread basket. yes, something as simple as a bread basket was quite possibly the highlight of our meals. \n\ni went with 2 girlfriends and decided on one duck and <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark>, one spaghetti, and one tagliatelle for our meals and a polenta with mushroom fricasee to share. so we're waiting for our food and they bring out the bread basket and some butter, olive oil, and eggplant tapenade. ok, pretty standard. but once we opened up that napkin, we were pleasantly surprised with stromboli, rosemary bread, and biscuits piping hot from the oven! the stromboli was a perfect blend of crispy outside and soft buttery inside, with the salami and cheese adding the perfect amount of salt. if that wasn't good enough, the rosemary bread. wow. i absolutely love rosemary though so i may be biased. anyway, we asked for another basket of bread and polished that one off long before our appetizer even touched down on the table. \n\nto start, we ordered the polenta with mushrooms and our server told us it was just a small bite meant for one person, but the 3 of us were able to share it without wanting more. at this point we were already getting full! finally our entrees came and everything was on point. the rich duck/<mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark>, the clean but complicated flavors of the spaghetti, and the fresh, crisp spring veggie tagliatelle. amazing. you really can't beat fresh pasta. i paired my meal with their pinot noir which was a great complement but i barely even remembered to drink it because i was so enamored with the food. next time, i may try not to eat as much bread...oh who am i kidding. it's too good!", 
            "i loved everything about scarpetta, from the food to the great ambiance overlooking the bellagio water show. \nscott conant puts his own unique twists on italian classics, starting with the bread basket accompanied creamy butter, sun dried tomatoes and citrus infused olive oil, which is a very nice touch. let's not gloss over the bread basket like you would at most of your standard restaurants, this bread basket is special. maybe one of my favorite parts of the meal was the stromboli bread, dipped in some olive oil and topped with the sun dried tomatoes, i could eat that all day.  \nanother highlight of this meal was the braised short rib risotto primi piatti, this was a flawless dish. my best description of this dish would be, homey and earthy. the risotto had perfect texture and the short ribs were melt in your mouth braised.\nnext we had the spaghetti tomato basil and the duck & <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark>. both amazing pasta dishes in their own right. \nthe spaghetti tomato basil did not disappoint, the homemade pasta had just enough bite to it and the sauce was simple but deep in flavors. the tomato sauce had a buttery richness to it, with a hint of spice from the red pepper flakes, and some freshness from the basil. it's truly a perfect spaghetti.  \nduck & <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark> is very eloquent and rich. very deep in flavors and a smooth velvety texture to the foie gras filling. the marsala reduction rich and buttery smooth in it's own right and when combined with the raviolli gives a mike tyson ko punch of flavor. \ni highly recommend scarpetta. the prices are also reasonable when you consider the delicious free bread basket, which can be a meal in itself. a very delicious meal and romantic place take your significant other, what more could you ask for. absolutely a 5 star restaurant.\n\nas great as this meal was the one thing that stands out to me is the stromboli bread with the complimentary bread basket with olive oils and sun dried tomatoes.", 
            "this restaurant is a gem!  after eating at chef conant's other restaurant, d.o.c.g., earlier in the year, we decided to try scarpetta.  we were not disappointed.  i called two weeks ahead to request a signed cookbook.  the manager confirmed he got me a book and confirmed our reservation.  we were greeted with a warm smile and prosecco in honor of our anniversary.  my husband and i did the tasting menu with wine pairings and the staff went out of their way to serve us exquisitely prepared food, as well as a few additional dishes in honor of our special evening.  the pasta was fresh, the product was amazing and the wine pairings complimented all of the dishes perfectly.  our favorites were the spaghetti and the <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark> - to die for.",

            "last friday we came in at 9.30. the place was packed and the girls at the reception told us that we could eat at the bar or at the small tables on the opposite side of the bar. we choose to wait at the bar for a table in the restaurant, where it seemed to be more quiet. they told us the wait could be up to an hour, but we didn't really care.\n\nwe allready had a few cocktails before we came in, so i started to drink lots of water. we had to share our snack basket (patato chips, nice!) with the people sitting next to us. they shove it to their side of the bar, we didn't steal it back, so far the enjoyment of snacks. \n\nafter about 30 minutes it seemed like more and more people came in without reservation, but they were all given a table in the restaurant. we were still enjoying the bottled water, but after an hour waiting, my boyfriend walked up to the reception and they made our table ready, thanking us for the long wait. when we were seated, we noticed that the restaurant wasn't that full anymore. we were seated at a table apart from the other guest, in the corner of an almost empty room, where it wasn't that warm. they gave us some really nice bread and i didn't want to be snobby, but i did ask for another table. they were very nice and gave us a table by the window, overlooking the b fountains. not that we especially wanted that, but we did like to sit closer to other people. experiencing a restaurant isn't just about the food, it's also he temperature, the views, looking at other guest and the over all service.\n\nanyway, after this, everything was great. my boyfriend and i shared 4 courses, which were all perfectly made: the tartare, the <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark>, the <mark>Roasted Organic Chicken</mark> and the goat cheese cake. i was really stuffed (i also had 3 bottles of water) and happy. service was great, although we were asked a little to much if everything was okay. in holland we are not used to all that attentiveness.\n\n6 stars for the food, 4 for the somewhat weird start = 5 stars.",

            "what do you do when you're too cracked out to go clubbing in vegas? you eat at a fancy restaurant of course. \n\ndespite the reservations we were not seated as promptly as i would like, but the wait was not too long. we did request to be seated where we could see the fountains, a wish that went unfulfilled.i understand vegas was at its capacity that weekend so i suppose it is forgivable though disappointing. we had the braised short ribs, spaghetti, and the duck & <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark>. we ended the meal with an unmemorable custard. \n\nour waiter was excruciatingly nice, checking up on us every few minutes, never daring to let the water drain completely from our cups. he even remembered my boyfriend from his last business trip there.\n\nthe eggplant spread, short ribs, the spaghetti were nothing short of magnificent especially the spaghetti which lived up to all of its hype. i could eat an entire barrel of that spaghetti in all its simplistic perfection. my only issue was that my ravioli was so salty i could barely eat it. it won't deter me from coming back again though.",

            "for years, i've always felt that -- among the casinos -- the mgm grand has the best restaurants.  this may be changing, and scarpetta is *certainly* one of the biggest reasons why.  \n\nlynn and i followed up our \"good\" dinner wednesday night at comme \\u00c7a (also <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark>) with dinner at scarpetta the next night (followed friday night by los, but that's been written up way to many times).  \n\nbeing a celebrity chef is a double-edged sword . . . it certainly gets your name out there, but then you (typically) aren't there to defend it -- someone else is in the kitchen is, but if it sucks, you get the blame.  a potentially dicey proposition at best.\n\nscott conant need not worry; his vegas outpost is in excellent hands.\n\nthe six of us began with a bottle of n.v. champagne from chartogne-taillet (cuv\\u00e9e ste.-anne), and ordered a round of appetizers \"for the table.\"  (the table, too, apparently was hungry -- not just the six of us!)  \n\nfinishing the champagne just as the appetizers arrived, we moved into a 2008 bruno giacosa arneis.  we enjoyed the <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> crudo, the <mark>Creamy Polenta</mark> with a fricassee of truffled mushrooms (the winner of this round, imho), and the roasted sea scallops with porcini and sunchokes . . . all were delightful!\n\nvegetarian alert:  this place is *very* cool, and vegetarian-friendly.  they have a totally separate vegetarian and vegan menu available for the asking (as one in our party did).\n\nmoving into the pasta course, we had the spaghetti with tomato and basil (so simple to say, so profound to eat -- nothing can describe the layers of flavor that you get here; magnificent!), the duck & <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark> with marsala reduction (ok, this is to die for!), and the <mark>Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti</mark> with with brown butter horseradish.  of course, we also moved into a stunning piedmontese red, the 1999 barbaesco riserva vigneti in ovello from the  produttori del barbaresco.  just gorgeous!\n\nour entr\\u00e9es included <mark>Black Cod</mark> with caramelized fennel & concentrated tomato, sirloin with potato gnocchi, wild mushrooms, parmigiano & barolo ragu, a veal chop the size of baltimore (and much more tasty), and the aforementioned spaghetti with tomato and basil (as an entr\\u00e9e portion).  \n\na little dessert, a little porto and coffee, and the world is a perfect place!\n\np.s. in case you haven't figured it out yet, their wine list is not only incredible, but there are some true gems on this list that remain real bargains (if you know how/where to look).", 
            "the diners: 9 ladies celebrating a bachelorette weekend. \nreservation time: 7:30p sat night.  we were late about 15 min. but we called ahead to let them know and they were cool about it. \nsome things we ordered:\n-calamari: thinly cut and deliciously flaky and salty.\n-<mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> appetizer: nicely flavored but oh-so not enough!  5 thin pieces\n-scallops: meh but then again i'm not a fan of scallops\n-duck & <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark>:  extremely rich, definitely get as appetizer and not an entree\n-black farfalle: the presentation didn't look that appealing cuz it is literally a dish of black pasta, but taste-wise it was pretty good; small but sufficient amounts of maine lobster\n-halibut: on the drier side\n-stracchi: interestingly small squares of flat pasta\n-desserts: napoleon was popular with the group, zeppole was so-so, <mark>Chocolate Cake</mark> was really rich but imo yummiest of all the desserts, and lastly....the cheesecake....blech!\n\ndescription of the cheesecake dessert on the menu...\"cheesecake.  mango granita, pistachio brittle\".  when you order cheesecake, you expect to get a sweet creamy cake made from cream cheese, right?  not here!  it's goat cheese people!  so if you like goat cheese cheesecake you'll love the cheesecake at scarpetta.  most of the food was actually pretty good (4 stars worth) but because the stupid bald older waiter of ours failed to tell 2 of us who ordered the cheesecake that it is made from goat cheese, and then proceeded to argue w/ me saying that \"goat cheese\" was written on the menu...uh no it was not, can you read english?!...that took it down a notch for me.  not sure i'd go back myself.  if i do, i'll make sure not to have that guy wait on me again.", 
            "i'm a huge scott conant fan. his food is my food, yo. \n\nwent back last weekend and the boyf and i went full throttle. 3 pastas! that's how we roll! \n\ni've never had an entree here, i could leave most of the appetizers (except for a ridiculously awesome gazpacho), but the pasta is sick. \n\nratings:\n#1 spaghetti with tomato sauce:  ok- how does he do it? it's some pasta, it's some tomato sauce. why is this heaven? it's tart, rich, chewy- this could be a whole meal. i've scoured the interwebs and come up with a pretty good approximation of his sauce (hint, infused olive oil, fast cooking times, butter, fresh basil, and grated parmigiano play a big role). but that pasta, how is it fresh and al dente all at once? the waiters are all coy minxes about this one. \n\n#2 <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark>: very rich, cloying in a good way: super umami and flavor town. this doesn't skimp on the foie. we love it. \n\n#3 stracci- leek and shellfish rough cut pasta. subtle and awesome, the pasta is again the star of the show. it's silky and coated in a wonderful leek sauce. i'm a salt nut and thought this could have been more heavily seasoned. \n\n#4 truffle tagliarelle- special last weekend. we had to try it. this was almost too subtle. it was almost refreshing, which you wouldn't expect from a cream and truffle based sauce. \n\n#5 lobster black farfalle- actually, the truffle and the lobster were at around the same level for me. this was again very subtle, deliciously textured pasta, the lobster was happy, but not the star. \n\nit's all great here, but if you don't get the spaghetti with pasta sauce, you're doing yourself a disservice. \n\natmosphere is fine, if you can, request a table close to the window to view the bellagio water show. \n\nwaitstaff is generally good. the sommelier really upsells his wine, especially the expensive stuff, which is lame (i bet he'll tell you to try some peter michael stuff which is like 3x+ the retail here). but on the plus side, the wine he's chosen is truly good. we had an insanely awesome white burgundy and i have to stop this review right now to go look up the name.", 
            "we had a very pleasant experience at scarpetta on monday night. \n\nthe food was 5 star all the way in our minds, however our service was a bit hit and miss. \n\nluckily the support staff was really fantastic. the menu itself can be a bit intimidating so i looked to our server for advice, he briefly listed ingredients to me, not taste which is very important for me. \n\nalso one big thing we did not like, by any means, was not only being served from our right but from behind. during the course of service the staff kept reaching from behind in our booth which was not just annoying, but actually uncomfortable. we felt like school kids who were practically told to sit still. it was very odd.... \n\nthe hits \nwere the short rib app, and the gazpacho soup \n\nthe foie gras and <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark>, which isn't as gamey as is sounds surprisingly and spaghetti was tremendous! :)", 
            "a-ok is what scarpetta was. i was very excited to finally taste the famous pasta from the man himself-scott conant. i have been watching chopped for weeks and was curious what exactly does he think amazing pasta is. well scott maybe pasta is the only thing you should stick to.\n\nwe have ordered the hamachi, tuna, polenta, <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark>, <mark>Black Cod</mark> and the tasting menu.\n\nlet's start from the beginning. first of all i would like to say that the service was beyond reparable. we sat at the restaurant for almost 3 hours. it took the server to give us the menu for about half an hour and every time we looked for him he wasn't there. after hinting and hinting that we would like our food right away the longer it took to the point where we just left.\n\nhere is the breakdown:\n\nhamachi: nothing special-nobu beats this dish any day of the week.\n\n<mark>Tuna susci</mark>: if you think wrapping tuna over a bunch of carrots is creative-think again.\n\npolenta: i really enjoyed this dish. it came in a small pot with a mushroom sauce on the side. this was one of my favorite appetizers.\n\n<mark>Black Cod</mark>: it was a-ok. i wish it had more flavor and was more moist. i guess beggars can't be choosers. \n\nduck and <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark>: the dough was chewy and hard. the sauce on top ruined the whole dish in my opinion. the inside was tender and rich. i think if the ravioli were smaller and more tender it would come together better.\n\ntasting menu:\n\n<mark>Crispy Fritto Misto</mark>: a-ok. i like anchovies but i don't think this dish brought anything special to the table.\n\nspaghetti with tomato and basil was the best dish of the night! it was tender, flavorful and tasty. i would have this again any day!\n\ndessert: the <mark>Chocolate Cake</mark> was dry and even with the gelato on the side it still left a bitter rough flavor in my mouth!\n\nwe tried a few other things which i don't even care to discuss on the tasting menu\n\nthe bread basket was also pretty amazing! it came with 3 sauces which we ordered a second round of!\n\noverall i am not impressed by this italian restaurant. this has nothing to do with price or the atmosphere. i think as a food critic what you look at is the freshness of the food and the service. i have seen a lot of bad service but ignoring your patrons will not bring you very far.\n\nso scott conant i am giving you a c+. you have been chopped!",

            "if you go here at night, make sure you get a good view of the bellagio fountains because that's half the experience of going here. the other half is the delicious ham and cheese bread they give you. i probably could have just eaten that for a meal.\n\nanyway, food came out a little slow. the duck and <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark> was indeed salty as another reviewer mentioned. i did enjoy the <mark>Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti</mark> though. not sure if i've ever tasted anything like it before.", 
            "the bf and i had trouble deciding where to go for our anniversary and he had put me to the task of finding a place with a scallop appetizer and a solid light white fish entree and scarpetta won out in our short lists of places that fit the bill. \n\ni love the 50's low lights and bold dark wood grain used in the restaurant. we were seated by the windows to witness a rainy and moody sky (which i happen to like). people said this is a nice view...but there is a large partition on the windows and it happens to be at eye level.  i cant see the water, only the top of the spray of the bellagio show. it defeated the purpose a little bit....\n\nstarters\n\nwe started off with the raved about bread basket. there was a stromboli in there rolled with cheeses and salami that was delicious. if i could order that at the lounge i would. there was also sourdough slice, a bread roll, 2 herbed foccacia squares. they give a trio of butter, a eggplant caponata and citrus infused oil. caponata was lovely and all the bread was warm, soft and nicely crusty.\n\nroasted sea scallops- which they split onto two presentations for each of us to have one. it was a very fresh scallop, nicely seared. there was a light spice that came through as you chewed it, capers and bottarga on top gave some briny flavor, micro green some bitterness and salmoriglio made for a nice creamy sauce to it. it was served on top of a steak of cauliflower that was nicely roasted. \n\nduck and <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark> with marsala reduction - was one i was very curious about since many rave about this and the spaghetti. i've had the spaghetti before in la (and did not weep) and now that i actually know the scarpetta recipe and have replicated it, i wanted to know if something else was rave worthy. this was tasty, but it was just a bit too rich for such a big plate of it.  some may love a whole heap, but i'm glad it was split as a appetizer...and still there was too many for us. we're freegetarians ( semi vegetarians) and don't really have many rich foods since switching over to the dark side..\n\nentree\n\nmediterranean branzino - came with 2 nice sized filets with nicely crisp skin and beautifully flaky meat. if came with a bed of braised leeks, celery root, shrimps, clams and mussels and had a seafood broth reduction as a sauce so it was very clean, sea flavors going on here.\n\n<mark>Black Cod</mark> - fish was nice and buttery, with a herbaceous,somewhat anise tasting, tomato glaze and micro chives. it had caramelized fennel & roasted tomato to go with. i've always had <mark>Black Cod</mark> aka butterfish in a asian preparation so this was interesting to try something different. \n\nthe bf preferred the branzino and so did i.\n\ndessert \n\nzeppole - with nutella center, vanilla sauce & candied hazelnuts was divine. these were rich pillows of heaven. i love zeppoles and beignets of all kinds and this is among the best i've had. will come back. just for these. \n\nbrown butter hazelnut cake - the name makes it sound like it would be more brown buttery cakey thing, but it truly was more about the lemon curd, meringue. i'm slowly growing to like lemon desserts and this was good enough to make me believe in it. it had olive oil gelato & candied hazelnuts to go which gave a light savory aspect to it. this was a great choice to balance out the zeppole since those were just dense and this was bright. \n\nservice was decent. there was a mixup with the kitchen and our appetizers went to the wrong table at first, back to the kitchen and eventually to us. service cleared plates and refilled drinks quite frequently and checked on us. a little weird note but in the area we were seated the chef was coming around and talking to tables and even serving one of the tables around us. i guess good that there are regulars but found little awkward as well. \n\nit was a solid choice for dinner and went home happy. i see they have a vegetarian menu and have a nice lounge area so i would consider coming back for a snack there and those zeppoles...i don't know if i would do a \"all out\" dinner here again though.\n\nthe night after our dinner here we went to a establishment off strip and the flavor and quality was on par with better prices, vibe and surpasses in service. \n\noverall, scott conants place is solid for the strip and i'm glad it is here, but it was surprisingly not the star of our weekend.", 
            "even though i live in nyc, i've never dined at scarpetta in nyc.  very much enjoyed scarpetta in las vegas in the cosmopolitan hotel.  service was very friendly and attentive.  i was dining solo, and was seated at the best table in the restaurant with a perfect view of the bellagio fountains that are splendid.  the stromboli in the bread basket is delicious!  loved the duck and <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark> with marsala.  very generous portion.  the main course of duck with endive was very good (very soft), but i've had better duck dishes (le cirque and robuchon in lv).  the zeppoles were a bit overdone (too dark) and there was too much nutella filling.", 
            "the best meal in las vegas. the beau is a italian food snob and he is so picky about italian food since he lived there for six months previously.  the bread basket is wonderful and so full of options. we could have gotten full just eating that. we had the hamachi which was so fresh and melted in your mouth.  the highlight of the meal was the duck and <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark>. yes i just said that, and it was the most beautiful pasta i've had in my life. the pasta was so fresh and light, cooked perfectly. the filling was creamy and decadent. i want to go back just for that.  the service was impeccable as well.",

            "came here for a girl's weekend out. what a great experience! \nscarpetta is located on the third floor of the cosmopolitan hotel. it's quite swanky, so you will want to dress up so you don't stick out like a sore thumb. the ambience is classy /sophisticated. the lighting is a bit dark, but that's why this is a great set up for looking out the window at night to see the bellagio water show. it's a great place to take a date or to just have a \"let's get dressed up cuz we can\" night out with the girls.\nwe had a reservation, so we were seated immediately. may i just mention that the service here is magnificent. there was just the three of us, but they still sat us in a huge booth that can easily sit 6 people. it's a circular booth, so i was a little apprehensive about scooting with my little black dress on. without saying a word, our host slid the whole table out, so that we can walk to our seats instead of scooting. from then, they had already won me over =).\n ok, let's get to the food shall we? we started with the \"<mark>Braised Short Ribs of Beef</mark>\" which is placed over root vegetables and risotto. delish. the short rib was soft and delicate and melt in your mouth deliciousness. not over seasoned at all. there are four small pieces, but each bite is delightful. the other appetizer that we decided to share was the \"roasted sea scallops\" which is served over cauliflower, bottarge, cili and caper sauce. aaaaaaaaaa-mazing. if i wasn't so nice, i would've eaten both pieces instead of share it. ;-)\nthe complimentary bread came with three spreads - butter, eggplant, and olive oil. all three tasted great and the different types of bread were warm and soft and all kinds of good =p. and since i love bread... this just won me over even more.\nso since this is an italian restaurant and the chef became famous because of his spaghetti, we all decided to order pasta. we ordered \"duck and <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark>\", \"spaghetti,\" and \"stracci\"... all of which were heavenly. the ravioli was soft, but not mushy and filled with such great flavor that my friend, who was already really full midway, ate the whole entire dish. spaghetti - you think it's just regular good ol' spaghetti... not at all. the pasta was cooked perfectly and the seasoning was on point. not too salty, not too sweet. perfect. my dish was the stracci - flat pieces of hand made noodles with lobster, crab, shrimp, and basil breadcrumbs. if you're mouth has not watered just reading that - something is seriously wrong with you. this is probably my most favorite pasta dish. they did not skimp on the blue crabs (i at least believe it's blue crabs, though, i can't be entirely sure), the lobster mean, and the shrimp. i wanted to save room for dessert, but i just couldn't stop stuffing myself with this dish. i loved that the flat noodles didn't stick to each other and it was soft and just really well made. i loved loved loved it!\ni wish i could tell you we ordered dessert. but the three of us were just so full that we decided to opt out of the dessert. though all of them sounded amazing.\nin any case, i rarely give out 5's. for me, something has to stick out. in this case, though the food was extraordinary, the service and the view puts it over my usual 4 stars into  a 5 star <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> review.\nbottom line: i would definitely come here again.. so there's not reason why you shouldn't try it out =)", 
            "when it came time to celebrate my 32nd birthday, scarpetta, it was. i made 5:30 reservations on opentable.\n\nwe were the first diners of the evening, we were seated at a table for two overlooking the bellagio fountains. however, when the fountain show actually began the we realized the view was quite obstructed from the tall trees surrounding the lake. it was no bother, we didn't come for the view, we were there for the food. \n \nwe started with a delicious bread basket, it had a variety of italian breads and the real treat was stromboli with prosciutto and smoked mozzarella. citrus olive oil, butter with marscapone and eggplant & tomatoes accompanied the bread. i could've easily made a meal from this, but i ordered the <mark>Creamy Polenta</mark> to whet our appetite.\n\ni've heard nothing but praises for this polenta. it was a beautiful dish. luscious and full of truffle flavor, but it didn't leave me wanting more. \n\nnext, we opted to skip the entrees and order selections from the secondini portion of the meal. frank went with the signature spaghetti. it's been featured on \"the best thing i ever ate\" so it's hard to pass it up. i went with the duck and <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark>. it was the dish that made me lust over the restaurant for the past year. \n\nthe ravioli did not disappoint. it was the second best ravioli i've had to date. mama egi's ravioli over at circo takes the cake. but this was very, very good. well balanced and the raviolis seemed to melt on your tongue. the spaghetti was good, but hardly a best thing i ever ate. i enjoyed the simplicity of it, the al dente noodle, but $26 spaghetti should knock my socks off, it did not. \n\nwe weren't overly stuffed so we took a gander at the dessert menu and quickly chose zeppole for dessert.\n\nnow, this was special! i'm not fond of dessert oozing with sweetness. this bordered on savory and i love it. these little pillowy bites were filled with nutella and topped with candied hazelnuts. there was a creme anglaise for dipping. it was a perfect end to the meal. \n\nservice was very good throughout. our server, luis, was helpful and he made certain we did not go thirsty. fresh iced teas were plentiful. the meal set us back $92. pretty good considering one could easily spend an arm and leg here.", 
            "omg omg omg!\n\nif you're in vegas you have to, must go! eat at scarpetta words can't describe the yumminess of it all. \n\nall their pastas were perfectly al dente. <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark> were my favorite.",

            "after reading all the reviews here, i decided to try the fantastic pasta place that <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> are craving about.  the restaurant is located on the third floor at cosmopolitan hotel and it is an easy find once you reach there.  it's a nice high end restaurant and you can pick the window seat so you get to overlook the bellagio fountain.\n\nwe are a huge party so i get to try couple different appetizers and main dish.  i have to say, it is a total disappointment.  not to bash on their food because the food actually  taste from ok to good, but the food does not taste like the level when you are spending 50 dollars a person.  it lacks that \"wow\" factor.  \n\nto further breakdown the night, there are two things that wowed me.  first, is their salami bread, it is really tasty and you rarely see it from any other restaurant. second, is their <mark>Creamy Polenta</mark>, you need to eat it while its hot and it is delicious.\n\nhowever, all the other dishes are mediocre at best.  i ordered the duck and <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark>, and it is so salty.  i love salty food and always add extra pepper and salt on my french fries, and even i have a hard time taking on the saltiness of its duck and <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark>.  also, their tomato & basil spaghetti is very plain.  taste good if it is $15, but not at $24.  \n\none worst part is their restroom.  they have 1 female and 1 male restroom, and you can only use it one person at a time.  so, during the night, people kept waiting in line for restroom.  i understand the fact that you can exit the restaurant and there is another cosmopolitan restroom outside, but isn't it a little absurd when you have only one bathroom stall in the restaurant.  \n\noverall, it is not my best vegas restaurant experience, i would rate it somewhere between 2.5 stars to 3 stars.", 
            "the worst part about scarpetta is that you eventually have to leave. it was a sad moment when i took my last bite of amazingness and realized i was already having separation anxiety with my duck and <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark>. not to mention the mouth orgasm i had after over indulging in the bombolini dessert with nutella dust. (went back the following night for an encore performance ). i am not going to sit here all day and rave about how perfect the beef tartare was or how life altering the short rib angolottis were, but what i will do is tell anyone who has anything bad to say about scarpetta, you honestly don't have a clue what good food is all about. i just read 30 reviews and one person had said \"the <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark> flat out sucked\" dude stfu and have some respect. i guarantee you are the type of db that enjoys the food at olive garden. get a grip. here is my run down from a foodie who has traveled the world in search of great cuisine and spend 10 years running kitchens:\n\nservice-\nfrom the hostess to the table service, everything surpassed my high expectations. very attentive without being over bearing. luis was very sociable and you could tell he wasn't trying to up-sell anything and he gave his honest opinion when needed. very knowledgeable about the menu and was honestly fantastic.\n\nambiance-\nvery comfortable, modern atmosphere complimented by great music and bellaggio fountains.\n\nfood quality-\nfresh pasta! come on how can you complain about fresh pasta  i guess if you like rubber olive garden garbage pasta and you didn't enjoy the king of pasta's execution then your review is null.\n\noverall food experience-\nthere is only one way to sum up scarpetta so the common man can understand how great this experience is: \n\nif you like the fake bread sticks and man made olive oil at olive garden then you aren't going to like the fresh baked bread and stromboli complimented by lemon olive oil, eggplant capanata, or marscapone butter.\n\nif you like frozen pasta that been frost bitten for 2 years, then your aren't going to enjoy fresh made pasta stuffed with delicate meats such as duck or short rib.\n\nif you go to the outback and are really wowed by the meat quality then you aren't going to understand the complexity of meat that they use here. \n\nso for you complaining feeble minded <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark>, stay away from scarpetta, you do not deserve to enjoy and embrace what this amazing restaurant has to offer. to the foodies who share my same enthusiasm for this amazing restaurant, you know how excited i am to go back.", 
            "phenomenal restaurant. i've had the pleasure to dine at some pretty great places around the country and this was in the top 5. \n\nlet's start with the food. delicious. basically perfect. one down side - they were not offering the tasting menu the evening i was there. as a fan of tasting menus (especially with wine pairings!) this was disappointing. anyway, as others have mentioned, the bread is great. we also started with the short rib risotto appetizer as well as the <mark>Crispy Fritto Misto</mark>. both were delightful. as far as the entrees - myself and my 3 dining partners all got pasta. the spaghetti (again, as many other reviewers have commented on) was wonderful. i don't think i've ever ordered spaghetti at a restaurant and probably wouldn't had i not read the rave reviews on <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> (though the waiter did highly recommend it). it was simple yet extremely tasty. the only gripe i have is it seemed a little overpriced given the minimalistic dish (~$24) but was fair given the prices of other dishes on the menu. we also tried the duck and <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark> which was rich and delicious. the beef short rib pasta was also very good, though a little too horseradishy for my taste. \n\nthe food would've earned the restaurant 5 stars in my book regardless, but the service made the experience one of a kind. maybe the waiter has the same \"routine\" for everyone, but who cares? he was attentive, friendly, professional but not at all annoying. \n\nthe only bad part about the night is i didn't get to try dessert (too full)!",

            "my favorite thing about vegas is not the casinos, shows, or nightclubs (although the latter is a close second), but the abundance and quality of fine dining.  one of my girl friends requested that we dine at the cosmopolitan on our vegas getaway, so i picked scarpetta because it was spendy but not quite a splurge like \\u00e9 by jos\\u00e9 andr\\u00e9s or blue ribbon sushi bar & grill.\n\nas far as italian food goes, scarpetta was scrumptious, though overpriced like everything on the strip.  my girl friends and i were seated at a big, chic horseshoe booth--and if it weren't for our next destination (dancing at tryst and xs), i likely would've drank and ate more here. \n\nfor my appetizer i had the spring <mark>Chilled Pea Soup</mark> ($16) with gulf shrimp, guanciale (italian bacon), and reisling gelee.  it was the most delicious <mark>Chilled Pea Soup</mark> i've ever had in my life! incredibly balanced, fresh, flavorful, and masterfully presented.  \n\nfor my main i had the duck & <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark> ($26) with marsala reduction.  i absolutely wanted to love this dish due to the presence of foie gras, but i could barely taste the foie gras, let alone the duck.  i did appreciate, however, that the pasta was homemade.  crystal l.'s main course, the <mark>Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti</mark> ($25), with brown butter horseradish and toasted breadcrumb was a much better choice for pasta--i was so happy when she literally gave me half!  i knew then and there that this was going to be a wonderful night!\n\nif you like classic trattoria fare, i wouldn't go to scarpetta.  but if you don't mind fancy, modern italian, look no further.",

            "i'd like to preface this review by saying i haven't had very many fine dining experiences. that being said, this is by far one of the best in terms of food quality and service. yes, it is indeed pricey, but that should be expected with any fine dining experience no matter where you are.\n\ni can only comment on the dishes i tried, so here they are:\n+ complimentary bread & spread - all of the bread was great. for our spread, we had olive oil, egg plant, and marscapone cheese. i've always preferred butter instead of olive oil, but this one was quite tasty. the olive oil had an almost herbal/spice taste to it. the egg plant is prepared with a tomato sauce or something, so it paired really well with the stromboli bread.\n+ roasted sea scallop appetizer - delicious, practically melts in your mouth. the portion is rather small as you only get two.\n+ duck and <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark> - very rich to the point where it was almost a struggle to finish the plate, but it was so scrumptious, i couldn't stop eating.\n+ spaghetti - probably one of the best i've ever had. pasta perfectly al dente with just tomato and basil, but the sauce had a creaminess to it that made it divine.\n+ <mark>Black Cod</mark> - another great dish, but overshadowed by all of the other fantastic plates. it was seasoned well. the accompanying cherry tomatoes tasted so bright. if i ever go to scarpetta again, though, i'd probably forego this dish and try something else.\n\nlastly, to expand on the service aspect, our waiter was very personable, cracking a few jokes throughout the night. he was helpful with making suggestions on the menu and explaining everything. our water glasses never really went low. oh, and the view of the bellagio fountain was gorgeous. only downside is the window divider thing was right at eye level, so we had to look above or below it to see. definitely a wonderful restaurant for a date night, though.",

(or paid off by scott conant, i'm not sure which...)\n\nthis place is dim (low lighting) and i can't remember much about the decor.  hey, it's vegas, i was on vacation and probably (okay, obviously) was pretty tipsy.  it's a perfect match for being inside the cosmopolitan.\n\nwhen i'm back in las vegas, i'm not sure that i'll need to come back here, but the memory of the ravioli will last a lifetime.",

            "man, i had high hopes for this place... but can we say overrated?!  i have a theory about vegas restaurants: they're all very hyped and expensive but tend to fall short on meeting expectations.\n\ni was in vegas for a convention so went in for dinner.  i ordered the duck and <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark> and it was so salty i couldn't eat more than one.  it actually felt weird on my tongue because it was so salty.   i normally don't like to send things back but there was no way i could eat the dish.  they gladly took it back and apologized.  i ordered the spaghetti in its place and they brought it out quickly so that i wasn't left waiting for my food while everyone else was eating.  everything that the others had were alright but definitely not memorable (i don't remember what they got).  the service was great and the food was ok but those two factors along with the ridiculous prices, i would probably never go back.", 
            "after much research on where to dine for our five year wedding anniversary, my husband and i decided on scarpetta. the menu looked delicious and the prices weren't outrageous. we called about three weeks in advance to make our reservation for seven people. i was surprised that they only had one time left but was very happy we were able to get in at 7:30pm. we were all super excited to dine there. i tweeted about it and they even tweeted back at me, which i thought was a nice touch. \n\nwe arrived a few minutes early for our reservation and only had to wait about five minutes for a table. we were hoping for a table by the window but didn't get one. we were near the wine wall but could still see the bellagio fountains. \n\ni'll break this review into two parts.\n\nservice:\ni'd never been to a higher end restaurant like this before, so i was expecting exceptional service like i had never previously received. while the service was very good, it didn't live up to my expectations. our waiter was a really nice guy, but i think he might have been newer because he seemed a little bit awkward and shy. also, i asked him to take a picture of our whole group and he forgot. then two people had to leave so when he finally did take the pic, not everyone was there. there was another man (paul?) who was in charge of the wine and he was another story. he was so suave and charming. i wish he could have been our waiter! there was a major glitch in our evening considering the type of place we were at. we receieved our bill, and as we were looking over it we realized they put two $125 bottles of wine on it rather than just the one. i'm glad we noticed, because that's a fairly big mistake to make. service in general was on the slower side. there were many gaps where nobody came to our table. we were there for about two hours. the guy refilling the water glasses was really nice, though.\n\nfood:\nbetween the seven of us, we ordered:\n-<mark>Crispy Fritto Misto</mark> (x2)\n-heirloom tomato salad\n-<mark>Creamy Polenta</mark>\n-tagliatelle (x2) (this is what i ordered)\n-duck and <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark>\n-spaghetti\n-pea tortelli\n-i know i'm missing one, but i can't remember/obviously didn't try a bite.\n\ni had bites of everything and it was all delicious. of course, the bread starter was fantastic. the polenta was great and rich. the ravioli was so rich, i wouldn't have been able to eat it as my main dish. it was also incredibly salty. it might be nice in a smaller size as a starter. the vegetables in my tagliatelle were super fresh - such a difference fresh veggies make! the spaghetti was very good, fresh and delicious, but it didn't knock my socks off like it has for some other people. of all of the pastas i tried, i would order the pea tortelli next time. the portion sizes are not large, but just a nice amount to leave you satisfied and not bursting. \n\nthe atmosphere of the restaurant was nice. not as intimate as i wanted, but i think we would have had to spend more somewhere else for that. i was sort of surprised that there were a lot of skimpily dressed stagettes and dudes in t-shirts and baseball hats! \n\nwe had a very good experience here but it just fell a bit short of my expectations based on the many other reviews i read.", 
            "i *thought* i knew italian food.  i thought i had pizza and pasta figured out.\n\ni was wrong.\n\nthanks to my dinner at scarpetta, my appreciation for the sophistication of italian cuisine is vastly more than it used to be.\n\nin other words, scarpetta gave me an education in fine italian dining that i'll never forget.\n\nit all happened on a sunday night, which was the only night of the week when i could secure a table at scarpetta -- a restaurant notorious for its difficulty in scoring a reservation.  after walking through the narrow entrance hall on the third floor of the cosmopolitan hotel, i was greeted by a spacious and elegantly appointed dining room.  i was lucky enough to have a window seat directly overlooking the bellagio fountains.\n\ni quickly received a menu from my kind and gracious server, giampaolo, and found myself drooling over its mouthwatering options.  while i waited, giampaolo brought by a breadbasket with sides of citrus-inflused olive oil, eggplant tapanade, and whipped mascarpone cheese.  the breadbasket was superb -- especially the stromboli with cheese and succulent salami baked inside.\n\ni wasn't in the mood for wine, so i started by ordering of their signature cocktails -- a st. germain/prosecco spritzer.  sweet and refreshing, it was a lovely start to dinner.\n\nfor an appetizer, i had the <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> crudo.  the <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> was extremely fresh and beautifully seasoned.  i especially enjoyed that little punch of sea salt that hits you after the rest of the fish is gone.  (who said that japanese restaurants have a monopoly on <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark>?)\n\nthe real show-stopper was the entree -- duck and <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark>.  i don't claim to be a foie gras expert, but this dish was revelatory.  the ravioli dough was delicate and flavorful.  the duck and foie gras filling could only be described as pure decadence.  the sauce drizzled on top provided a beautiful contrast.  this was one of the top dishes that i've ordered in any restaurant -- ever.\n\nafter the ravioli, i was too full to order dessert, but giampaolo was still kind enough to bring over two complementary petit fours -- a cinnamon biscotti cookie and a chocolate truffle.  both were outstanding.\n\neverything about scarpetta is outstanding -- from the service, to the ambiance, to the extraordinary food.  \n\nif i could, i'd get my culinary education here every day.", 
            "after visiting scarpetta in la, i cannot wait to see what the vegas one has to offer. they serve the same menu but the ambiance there is totally different. the vegas one has a gorgeous view of bellagio's fountain and the decor is more old, rustic and not as classy and glamorous as the la one. the waiter here is very helpful and funny. \n \nthe food here is delicious:\n\n+ beef tartare: cooked with lime juice so quite sour but refreshing. very different from traditional beef tartare.\n+ <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark>: it's okay. pretty typical, but i'm surprise how non-fatty the fish taste considering hamachi is a fattier fish.\n+ the spaghetti: good as always--al dente with a sauce that's sweet with a hint of tang. \n+ tagliatelle: a pasta with spring veggies. this tasted too green and peas-filled for me. the cream sauce also too thick. \n+ duck & <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark>: this was delicious but the foie gras taste is very mild. \n+ mediterranean branzino: the fish has a really, really nice sear on the outside and it was very soft and tasty. \n\ndon't skip dessert! dessert was phenomenal! \n\n+ st<mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> tart : the tart crust was amazing! it has that crunch and the cream was so light. the meringue that came with the dessert didn't taste like basil as described, but it was still really good. \n\n+and the nutella & vanilla creme bomboloni: reminds me of hot bigne with creamy nutty chocolate center! it's so good. and i have no idea how they caramelized a banana. it has the crunch and then creaminess of the fruit.", 
            "for the price of this place i found it to be just ok. heirloom tomato salad was good but not great. <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark> was a bit disappointing. the menu does offer many creative dishes and things you wouldn't find at your typical italian place.", 
            "it is a clean trendy restaurant with good food, but it is a little pricey and i expected a little more after reading all of the reviews.  i would recommend going in with lower expectations and you will be happy.\n\nfood\nthe food was very good, but it was not the best pasta i have eaten.  that honor goes to babbo in new york.  i would give scarpetta an 8/10.  it was rather pricey so not a good bang for the buck restaurant.  dinner for 2 was $150 with 1 glass of wine each.  so it was good, but not great.\nduck & <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark>.  this was the best dish of the night.  there were about 10 small raviolis and they were cooked just right.  they were tender and full of flavor.  9/10\ntomato & basil spaghetti.  it is a simple dish and the pasta is cooked al dente.  i would have preferred a little more tomato or basil flavors with the spaghetti, but it was good.  it looked small at first, but there was a good amount of pasta with the dish.  8/10.\ncolorado lamb loin.  the lamb was cooked medium rare and it was tender.  it was less gamey than other lambs and i think i wanted more flavor from the lamb itself.  6/10.  i expected more for $40.\ni had both the rosso and the rubrato red wines.  both were excellent and they had a very through wine list.  9/10  \n\nambiance\nit is quite a scene in the comsopolitan.  there were a lot of women hitting the club on the level above the restaurant.  the restaurant itself had a view overlooking the strip.  unfortunately, not all of the tables have that view and our table did not.  i would recommend making sure you get a table with a view.  you should for the price.  the restaurant looked clean and modern, similar to the hotel itself.  the chairs and tables were a little strange.  the chairs were hard to move and the table seemed to slide when you pushed away from it in your chair.  10/10\n\nservice\nthe waiter was attentive and kept checking on us throughout dinner.  he knew the menu and was informed about the dishes.  9/10", 
            "our party of 4 came to celebrate a friend's bday based on a recommendation. all reviewers who had previously mentioned about the great view of the bellagio fountain is correct. though, you'd get a much better view if you were a party of 2 seated right by the window, of course! \n\nservice was great! our server gave great recommendations and the other wait staff were fantastic! they kept bringing basket after delicious basket of bread with that citrus-infused olive oil and refilled our drinks constantly!\n\nwe ordered the <mark>Creamy Polenta</mark> with truffled mushrooms to share, duck and <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark>, pan-seared escolar with sun chokes, american wagyu rib cap and a lobster pasta  that was the daily special. the polenta was amazing!! we shared it but i was ready to order another for myself. the polenta itself was so fine that it added to its creaminess and then topped with the truffled mushroom sauce added to its heavenliness! all our entrees were delicious (as evidenced by the fact that nothing was left behind), except the  lobster pasta. while i enjoyed the fresh and sweet lobster and love the freshly made chewiness of the pasta (think udon in terms of thickness), the combination together with the sauce was not incredibly tasty. it almost resembled a lobster bisque type sauce and i think it made the dish too \"seafood-y.\" hands down our table's favorite was the american wagyu rib cap - wow!!! the meat itself was incredibly tender and so divine that it just melted in your mouth. even without the sauce reduction that accompanied it, the beef was naturally flavorful and worth its price tag. you don't get much but, you definitely get a phenomenal piece of meat! as for the ravioli, like others have mentioned, it was a bit on the salty side and even before our order, i mentioned it to our server and he gladly told us that the dish can be altered to fit our tastes. the escolar, not on the menu, was perfectly cooked and just as juicy and flaky as fish should be - delicious! \n\noverall, the order came out to be a bit over $200 with 2 iced teas, 1 appetizer and 4 entrees. it was well worth the deliciousness that filled our bellies, the unique experience of being in such a gorgeous atmosphere and great service! i would visit again in a heart beat and save my $$$ for the next special occasion.", 
            "let me start by saying that i've eaten at some pretty incredible places in vegas, spent a lot more money than i did here, but i absolutely enjoyed myself at scarpetta just as much at a fraction of the cost. everything was spot-on for our visit. despite having made last-minute reservations, we requested and received a booth where all four of us could see the fountains. the appetizers were amazing: we tried the <mark>Chilled Pea Soup</mark>, polenta, scallops, and short ribs. for entrees, two of us had the duck and <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark>, which i will be dreaming about for a long time; the <mark>Prime Aged Sirloin</mark>; and the spaghetti. one of us had dessert (yeah, that would be me), a <mark>Coconut Panna Cotta</mark> in a guava soup. perfect. my only complaint: the wine prices. they are, in a word, astronomical. i expect to pay double retail prices usually, maybe a bit more in vegas, but scarpetta is at least quadruple. so my husband chose beer, and i went with two glasses of wine and called it a day, rather than having to sell myself on the strip for a bottle.", 
            "after having a great experience at d.o.c.g., i will really excited to dine at scarpetta.  however, i walked away a bit underwhelmed by the food.  but the view of the bellagio fountains at sundown was fantastic and the service was the best i have had anywhere.  we had half a dozen oysters to start with, <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark>, and truffled pasta.  the first bite was very good but after that everything was very one-noted and boring.  taste buds were not enthused by the end of dinner.  while the staff was very good the service can get slow.  we almost missed our 10:30pm show as we were at dinner for over 2 hours. my only regret is that i should have tried the spaghetti!", 
            "came here on a friday night at 7pm with family and friends. it was a party of 10 so they sat us in the way back room. the lighting is dim and the restaurant is more quiet and elegant than loud and casual. you definitely can wear casual attire, but there were some people in very nice clothes, but what do you expect, its vegas! \n\nwe were given bread after getting our drinks/water. the bread is bomb here! it's not just one type of bread, they serve all sorts of different kinds of bread. they have sourdough bread, mini squares of garlic toast, and the best of all, cheese and salami bread. soo soo good. on top of that, they give you choice of butter, eggplant spread, or citrus olive oil. i think some of us got full of the bread and the bread is complementary and you can get as much as you want.\n\ni got the spaghetti and omg, it was actually pretty good! no wonder it is worth $24. it wasn't your traditional meat spaghetti. i don't know what it was, it was just really good! 5 people at the table got the spaghetti. lol.\n\na friend got the duck & <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark> and i tried one. it was actually not too bad, but definitely cannot get it as my own meal. just didn't fit my taste. it just seemed a bit mushy. \n\noverall this place was really good, but just a warning, portions are small for the price. this place in my opinion is considered more like fine dining than just your usual let me eat a lot for cheap. i honestly wouldn't have come here unless i was with my family. my friends and i would not have chosen this place because it is a bit out of our we are poor college student budgets.", 
            "came here for a special occasion after nora's wine bar closed.  we needed something that would wow us.  the ambiance certainly did, the service was great, and the food certainly did at times.\n\nwe did the tasting menu.  and the bottom line is that we were very happy, but not as happy as we could possibly be.  the expectation was high, and so was the price...so at the price we really needed it to come through for a 5 star rating...it ended as a 4 or 4.5 star experience for us.\n\nthere were a few items that left us wanting.  the spaghetti was good, but not the best thing i ever ate good (pasta or tomato... either way it was just above average good.)    the spaghetti was simple and lacked anything to set it off as truly amazing--coming off above-average, but slightly flat.  likewise we enjoyed the duck & <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark>, but not at the raved about level we hoped for. the raviolis were overly rich and lacking balance...we were vary happy to just have a small portion in the tasting menu.\n\nsome of our favorites were <mark>Black Cod</mark>, branzino, <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark>, and <mark>Creamy Polenta</mark> with fricassee of truffled mushrooms.\n\nwe were also happy with the bread basket...how can you not be though?...a bread basket that includes a stromboli of rolled with cheeses and salami...yes please!\n\nwe had an amazing seat overlooking the bellagio fountains.",

            "decor is amazing. they have a beautiful view of the strip and the interior is quite cozy with the low light setting.\n\nthe food in general was pretty good. the scallop and spaghetti were both so yummy! the noodle was slightly too al dente for me, but the sauce was so amazing. the <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark> had a strong foie gras taste to it. i couldn't really taste the duck. my least favorite of the night had to be the veal dish. the meat was dry and very lackluster.\n\nthe most amazing thing was the bread basket. it comes with a variety of dips and breads. there is one warm bread with salami embedded in the inside. i wish i have a whole basket of that!\n\nanywho, i would definitely come back for the bread and to try the spaghetti again. :)", 
            "i would rate this place a solid 4 stars for the decor, service and food. my fianc\\u00e9 had the duck and <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark> and i had the pici (lobster pasta). both entrees were good, but the dessert was definitely a delicious sweet ending. we ordered the nutella & vanilla creme bomboloni (mini filled donuts) and they were a little taste of heaven. would definitely recommend this place.", 
            "what an awesome italian restaurant.  the entrance is super secluded, and as the hostess led us down an empty hallway it seemed like the place was abandoned, but the hallway opened up into a large dining room.  we were seated by the windows and could see the bellagio fountains which was nice. \n    i got the berry smash to drink which was very average, a little too strong for my taste.  the bread basket they brought out was great, focacia, french bread and one more were average.  the best bread had salami and basil and maybe even cheese baked into it- so good.  there was a citrus olive oil to dip in, as well as butter, and an eggplant tomato spread.  definitely helped to liven up the more basic bread.  \n     the duck and <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark> were great.  first time having foie gras and we were not disappointed.  rich and delicious.  the spaghetti was unreal good- i did not think spaghetti could be that great.  finally, the veal chop looked great, and was very rich and tender.  the <mark>Chocolate Cake</mark> for dessert was probably the low point- it reminded us of an applebee's dessert, although the presentation was slightly better than that.  \n     the only other con was our server- he was very awkward and seemed to appear at all the wrong times to talk to us about the menu.  he rambled on about dishes just a little too much.  \n     would definitely have given a 5 with a different server and had we picked a different and hopefully better dessert.",

            "(1st review of 2013!)\n\nmy goodness, scott conant - you gave us the best meal in vegas, ever!\n\nlocated in the new cosmopolitan hotel, scarpetta's chic, dark, ambience welcomes you and your party (i observed some ranging from business meetings to bachelorette parties and everything in between, with different types of seating arrangements to  match) and the vibe was always cool and collected. the service felt disconnected - i would've removed 1 star because of that, but the food was so superb that i won't! we didn't have reservations because it was a last minute decision to dine there, but we were seated right away regardless.\n\nwe skipped appetizers and went straight for the entrees. my eyes went straight to the duck & fois <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark>! my heart jumped for joy realizing that fois gras is completely legal to sell here! i ordered it and it was the right decision! the pasta was cooked perfectly and the savory filling had a creamy texture that was bursting with flavor. it was like the perfect marriage of poultry and red meat flavor. definitely unforgettable! my husband enjoyed his tagliatelle (with fall vegetables, truffle zabaglione & guanciale) - it was very comforting and hearty.\n\nwe were full, but were able to make room for dessert: nutella and vanilla creme bomboloni which consisted of nutella ganache, caramalized bananas & nutella powder. wow! the bomboloni (like donut holes) were lovely fluffy and crispy, filled with either chocolate or vanilla cream. the bananas were fantastic, as were the ganache and powder, adding decadent levels of texture.\n\nso glad our impromptu evening of dining led us to scarpetta. highly recommended!",

            "scarpetta, located on the 3rd floor of the cosmopolitan, has roughly the same menu as its new york counterpart, including the famous spaghetti with butter - er, basil - and you can expect the same eyebrow-raising prices.  but it's delicious and, besides, you're in vegas so you clearly already hate money.  the atmosphere was relaxed, upscale and quiet, which may or may not be what you're looking for in a vegas dinner.\n\nthe service is a bit of a different story.  on the one hand, there were periods when we couldn't get anyone's attention for minutes at a time.  on the other hand, our server was overattentive whenever he was at our table.  for instance, when we were ordering, after we placed our order he would offer commentary on each dish.  this might just be a pet peeve of mine, but if i've already decided on a dish, i don't need you to tell me that it \"appears small on the plate, but the filling and the reduction are actually quite rich, so i think you'll be satisfied.\"  just say \"ok\" or nothing at all.\n\nto start i ordered the <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark>, which was incredible and i only wish there was more of it.  the sea salt was a really nice touch and i'm probably now going to be tempted to salt all of my sashimi going forward.\n\nfor my main, i had the duck and <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark>, which was similarly delicious (and enough food, i thought). according to our server, most people order three courses, but my group felt like two was enough.",

            "this place is good. definitely affordable fine dining and i would recommend friends to stop by. is it amazing and must try? yes and no. i'm sure there are other vegas establishments more on the wow factor, but pricewise for food and the experience, yes. please do visit.\n\ni came here with a friend and were able to request and get a seat by the window that looks over to the bellagio water fountains. pretty cool i must say.\n\nthe bread. oh my. they serve awesome bread here! there was a piece of sourdough bread on top of the basket covering two pieces of warm wheat type bread, two rosemary focaccia, and our favorite, cheese and salami wrapped bread!!! this last one was soooooo yummy!! the awesome bread basket came with salted butter, a tomato tapenade, and olive oil. oh my, we finished most of the bread basket, except the rosemary focaccia and had to ask for a second round of bread to accompany our meal! yes, that good. the salami cheese bread was probably my most favorite thing for dinner lol.\n\ni ordered the lobster pici, which was good. there were large pieces of lobster meat in it! there better be if it costed $38! the pici was cooked perfectly. nothing worng with this dish, but tasted like something i could have made at home. \n\nmy friend ordered the ricotta and mushroom agnolotti. this was really good. i had a few pieces and the wrapper on the agnolotti was super soft! it should be since they make their own spaghetti everyday.\n\nmy first choice for entree though was the duck and <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark>. un/lucky for me, my other friend went to dinner before me and had some leftovers, which i was able to try. these little suckers were really good heated up so i can only imagine what they would have tasted like if i ordered at dinner and the plate set in front of me. drools... so, i would recommend this dish definitely!!\n\nall in all, a really good dinner! the staff was all super professional, accommodating, and attentive. good job staff!", 
            "fantastic!  \ndinner at scarpetta was the last of 3 amazing valentine gifts.  i wanted to come here because i'm a fan of scott contant, and i was not disappointed. \n\nour meal was absolutely fantastic, the service was top notch and the atmosphere was perfect.\n\nwe started with a light and delicate glass of wine to go with <mark>Creamy Polenta</mark> and a fricassee of truffled mushrooms, i had the <mark>Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti</mark> and dave had the duck & <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark>, both were amazing and you know it had to be for me to eat foie gras :-)  we ended the meal perfectly with pana cotta and bomboloni. \n\ni highly recommend you come here when celebrating your next special moment, or, if your just in the mood for a perfect evening with the one you love.", 
            "surprised my boyfriend with dinner here this past saturday for his birthday. we made reservations for 7:30 and requested a table by the window. we were 5 minutes late because we had to stop by the atm which, by the way, is located right at the foot of the escalator by security. we were greeted by the hostesses and manager who were all friendly. the dining room itself was a lot smaller than i had expected. they were able to accommodate our request and we were seated at a beautiful 2 top with a perfect view of the bellagio fountains. water glasses were immediately filled and a bread basket magically appeared with 3 accompaniments: citrus infused olive oil, eggplant spread and my fav, mascarpone cheese... way better than boring butter! like everyone has already mentioned the bread basket was delish! we also got a bottle of red wine for a great price, $75. we shared everything and for some of the dishes they were actually able to split it in 2 so it would be easier to share! this was my first time tasting fresh pasta and you can most certainly taste a difference. there's a specific bite and texture that can't be compared to that dry stuff at the grocery... \n\n-<mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> tail: 4 very fresh pieces!!! love the salt sprinkled on it. and the pieces were actually pretty thick and not some skimpy thin little things.\n-<mark>Creamy Polenta</mark> with truffled mushrooms: perfect balance of creamy and sweet. i liked it because it was more like a soup for me haha\n-braised short ribs with risotto: tender chunks <mark>Braised Short Ribs of Beef</mark>. tasted like this korean short rib dish that i love. \n-duck & <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark>: my favorite dish of the night. it was so decadent and delicious. if you don't like the taste of strong cheese, you will not like this dish. the sweet marsala sauce paired perfect with it.\n-spaghetti: i'm sure some people have a problem spending $25 on a small plate of spaghetti but it definitely is something everyone should taste at least once. light, fresh sauce with perfectly aldente pasta... it is because of this dish alone my boyfriend had been wanting to come to scarpetta. he has made this recipe a couple times for me and i'm sorry to say but my boyfriend's spaghetti tastes exactly the same.. if not better. but then again my opinion may be biased haha\n-ny strip steak: it was a mistake ordering this because we were so full. we had to force ourselves to finish this dish haha at $55 though i didn't think the steak was that amazing.. it actually had some unwanted gristle on it. but i'm sure it would have tasted a lot better had we not been so full. \n\ni really wanted to get dessert for him and they were going to do something special for us but we were already so late for our show and not to mention so beyond stuffed.. we had to run out of there... literally, we ran out of there! \n\nservice was amazing all night from our server all the way down to the lady who came around with parmesan cheese and chili flakes. but special shout-out to paul k...the friendly food runner/expo who was so polite and quite knowledgeable about all of the food. \n\nthanks scarpetta! \nscott conant, you are hot \n;ppp", 
            "since i can't have access to foie gras anymore in california, it was a no brainer i would order the duck & <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark> in vegas....and an excellent choice i made.  the portions looked small but it does fill you up.  the beef tartare was also pretty amazing!  great cozy ambiance in the beautiful cosmopolitan hotel.  i would definitely come back.....after my wedding of course.", 
            "date/time: tuesday, february 26, 2012 / 8:30pm\n\nprice: $30-$75/person\nvalue: definitely worth the price, considering all the ingredients and the delicious flavor.\nambiance: love the interior. dim lights, great spot for an intimate dinner.\nchance of returning: 80%\n\n___________________________________\n\n:::: the food ::::\n\n* duck & <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark> w/marsala reduction\n         - [4/5 - extremely delicious and very rich. so rich, in fact, that while i loved the flavors.. i regretted ordering this dish all to myself. next time, i'll be sure to order more than one entree that i can share with my dining companion(s).]\n* stracci \n         - [4.5/5 - i hate to admit this, since the friend  who ordered this was obnoxiously picking on my order all night and insisting she had \"won\" as soon as she had the first bite of her dish... but her dish really was luscious. creamy layers of flat pasta with lobster, crab, and shrimp. i planned to order it the next time i went to scarpetta, but discovered today that it was unfortunately no longer on the menu.]\n\n___________________________________\n\nwe also ordered an appetizer to share and a few desserts, and everything really was good. i remember all of us wiping our plates clean.\n\n\"scarpetta\" was aptly named. ;-)", 
            "scarpetta was one of the best dining experiences i have had.  the atmosphere is quiet and romantic and we had a view of the bellagio fountains from our table.  the pasta was amazing - my husband had the duck and <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark> and i had the branzino.  both were excellent dishes.", 
            "easily one of the best meals we have had on the strip.  from start to finish, from the service to the food to the view, there was nothing anyone at our table could say negatively about scarpetta.\n\ni had the <mark>Black Cod</mark> which is apparently becoming very chic now.  it was so light and buttery that i only wish i could have had more.  it almost melts in your mouth.  \n\ngoing as a group was beneficial because we were able to try several of the pasta dishes and share.  i'm not sure the pastas are enough as an individual entree but probably too much for an individual appetizer...if that makes sense.  they are perfect for sharing.  we went with the short rip agnolotti, traditional spaghetti, and <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark>.  all were awesome, even the spaghetti which was a surprise to those at the table doubting a typical or plain type of pasta was worth a try.\n\ni would also highly recommend the lamb, at least 3 people at our table got it so i was lucky enough to have a bite or two.  it was perfectly cook on every plate and was so tender it was definitely a star of the menu.", 
            "simply put scarpetta is my favorite vegas restaurant. \ni've been a few times and each time i've left as satisfied as possible. \n\nfor an appetizer, i've had the squash soup, the <mark>Tuna susci</mark>, and braised short ribs. the squash soup is some of the best i've ever had. the tuna was good but i wouldn't get it again. the braised short ribs were perfect and while i have no idea what was in that sauce, it was heavenly. probably will get the braised short ribs the next few times i go.\n\nas for entrees, they are famous for their duck and <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark> and believe me, it lives up to the loftiest of expectations. it's such a unique dish and the duck and foie gras compliment each other perfectly. it doesn't feel too heavy, goes down sooooo smoothly and has this great sauce on top with just the perfect amount of cheese. ive had it multiple times and plan on getting it again in the future. \ni've also had the <mark>Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti</mark> which is almost as superb. the short rib is great and you get this really tasty hint of horseradish in the sauce. it's far from overwhelming, just a hint of it, but after a full plate of the agnolotti, you can certainly tell its there. but it doesn't take away from the dish, the short rib and pasta are both great.\nwhile i've not tried the <mark>Black Cod</mark> or the steak, my companions have and they have reported being very happy with their choices.\n\noddly enough, i've not had dessert at scarpetta. maybe in the future i will, i'm sure it will be tasty.\n\na few other things to note: the view is superb, definitely ask for a window seat and you'll get a side view of the bellagio fountains. it's just a matter of luck and if they have a table available, ask when you make the reservation. the portions are great. so often vegas portions (especially at nice restaurants) are so small, but these are adequate and leaves you filling full but not overly full (as often dishes are so heavy with fat and cream and such). the price is very appropriate. nothing is exorbitantly pricy, nothing is cheap, the price is correct.", 
            "came here on sunday night for my husband's birthday and it was phenomenal!  the service was outstanding, the food was amazing, and the wine was delicious!  i also want to compliment the lighting and overall ambiance in this place.  i know that's a weird thing to make note of, but it drives me crazy when there is a fab restaurant with crap lighting.  this place killed it in that department -- it was warm, cozy, and romantic (but it's also a great group spot -- there were tons of groups dining while we were there).\n\nthe sommelier helped us choose the perfect wine that was within our budget.  it was super earthy, full bodied, and reminded me of being in italy!  \n\nwe had the duck and <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark>, the black seafood pasta, and the veal and all were outstanding!  i would absolutely eat here again in the future.", 
            "we tried this place because we watch the chopped on food network all the time and wanted to try chef scott's food. \ni think i definitely have had better fine dines than my experience here. very beautiful and intimate place as being a luxury in lv is kinda basics. anyways, we tried their pasta dish with short rib, which the short rib was missing on that plate. i don't know where it was incorporated. if i was a chopped judge i would have taken points off for not really tasting this main ingredient in that dish. the horseradish was definitely the main kick in that dish. we also tried the bronzini fish dish which was pretty good and made to perfection. we tried our friends dish who got the foi <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark> and that was the highlight of the table. for desert we got the little round donuts which were pretty good. i have to mention that the bread service was definitely one of a kind with some bread baked with some kinda salami.", 
            "actually quite a nice experience here.  we had a light early dinner here in the bar/lounge area.  we were not allowed in the main dining hall due to a friend's attire (he had just got out of marquee, their pool club).\n\ni don't even fine italian food very often, but color me happy here.  the bread basket was awesome!  they had a salami bread in there... ask for extra :)  the olive tapenade they served it with was also stellar.  i could eat that stuff alone.\n\nordered the duck + <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark>.  it was really good.  friends ordered the spaghetti due to some rave reviews from my friend who had been here before.  i thought the spaghetti was good, but not $25 good.  the duck+<mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark> was possibly worth the $27 they charged for it.\n\nwe sat in the lounge, so maybe didn't get the full dining experience, so charging the full dining room price for lounge food knocked the experience down some. \n\nalmost a 5 star place imo.", 
            "skip the primi, dive into the secondi.  scarpetta excels at pasta.\n\nwhile it is true, a recent trip to italy has forever altered my perception of italian food (the reason for the loss of a star), scarpetta delivers with an italian chic d\\u00e9cor, light spirited service, contemporary plating, and italian cooking sensibility.\n\nstraight to the pastas.  plated as a secondi (second course before the main), portions are smaller.  do like the italians, save your bread to mop up the left over sauce once you finish the pasta.  trust me, do it, you'll understand.\n\nthe tagliatelle with a truffle zabaglione and guanciale, a take on carbonara is excellent.  all the flavor of carbonara are there, just lighter. the pasta is toothsome and near perfect.\n\nduck and <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark>.  thin sheets of translucent pasta around packets of duck and melting foie.  glazed with a sweet marsala and duck stock reduction.  the sauce is enriched with dribbles of foie fat as the little packets are broken open.\n\nfinally, the spaghetti with tomato and basil is a take on amatriciana.  simple, fresh pure of tomato, hint of fresh basil.  clean flavor.\n\nalthough i'm happy with two or three pastas, most think i've gone foodie crazy so if you must, the  mains.  the <mark>Spiced Duck Breast</mark> with endive, preserved orange, and cipollini onions is excellent.  perfectly rendered, the skin of the rare duck is crisp with no cloying underlying <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark>.  it's earthy, ducky flavor cut by the sauce of preserved orange and duck jus creates a very well balanced dish.  not to be outdone, the fennel spiced <mark>Black Cod</mark>.  hints of licorice taint the delicate flavor of the cod, the acidity of tomatoes and the briny, salty flavor of olives elevate it.  unfortunately, i couldn't find the mantecato of baccala the menu promised.  all good, the dish worked.\n\ngreat wine list.  heavy emphasis on italy.  \n\nis scarpetta truly italian?  no.  (you should still tip your server; i miss italy).  it does however, deliver a great experience.",

            "had dinner here on a friday night in vegas.  i've seen scott conant on chopped a hundred times and he always comes across as a little too full of himself, claiming to be the master of pasta.   with this in mind i was actually looking forward to criticizing his restaurant, but i just can't.  \n\ni ordered the <mark>Creamy Polenta</mark> appetizer and shared it with the table.  it was amazing, with the truffled mushrooms blending perfectly with the polenta whose \"creamy\" descriptor in the menu is both descriptive and right on.\n\ni then ordered the duck and <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark>.  i thought it would be too rich, but the portion was just right and somehow, despite it being duck with foie gras, was not too rich.  the pasta was cooked perfectly... damn you conant.  \n\nfor dessert we had the bombolini and the st<mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> souffle, both were great, with the bombolini being the favorite for the table.  \n\nthe dinner was absolutely lovely and everything was very flavorful, in perfect portions and made just right.", 
            "where to begin...  i went here 2 weeks ago and let's just say from the start it was sub-par.  first, the restaurant is practically hidden on the 3rd floor of the cosmopolitan.  trendy, loud hipsters abound, bad sign.  there is a tiny sign that you have to walk down a half corridor to see if this is indeed scarpetta.\n\nthe hostest, why are they all idiots, sat us in a half circle booth behind a party of 8.  so much for the view of the strip.  then it got worse, every waiter, bus-boy, customer as they passed behind us used the back the booth as a rail.  pat, pat, pat 6 inches behind my head.  awesome!  the interior of the place is the cause of this bad layout.  giant columns everywhere, wrapped in god-awful brown padding.\n\ni got the waiter and told him we needed to move.  he scurried away to get the manager?!?  she came over and did move us, hence the extra 1/2 star.  she moved us to the window, so i got to see the strip with a large drape in the way, that hadnt been dusted in forever.  \n\non to the food, achoo!  yes i sneezed my way through the dust cloud from pushing drape out of the way.  the salads were good, we split a garden salad and an heirloom tomato salad.  then i ordered duck & <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark> & my dining companion ordered the halibut wrapped in pancetta.  oh scott conant, yea of pretty hair and arrogance, you can't cook pastas right!  it was over cooked.  here is a hint, if all the raviolis stick together its over cooked.  if they are gummy and mushy its over cooked.  the halibut was dry, really dry, i mean damn i need a lot of water to eat this dish dry.  for dessert we split the donuts stuffed with vanilla cream or nutella, they were pretty good.  \n\nthe waiter was ok, he got his wine varietals mixed up and he had a richie-rich hair do, not kidding, that was humorous.  the bread guy is priceless, an old italian guy with good bread who should have been running the place.  he probably forgot more about pastas than scotty-boy knows.\n\nall in all a forgettable experience, unless you like overpriced, mediocre food.  the rest of these 4 star reviews i got to wonder about, i mean their fav thing was the bread so 4 stars?", 
            "scarpetta features a very good ambiance with a fantastic view of the  bellagio fountains. to get a great view, make sure you ask to be seated by the window upon reservation. ambience is dark, sexy and romantic, but different tables set different moods. they also have a booth section that is very secluded from the rest. \n\nstarting with the notable wine list, i decided to pair my dinner with a glass of malbec.\nshortly after, our server brought us the bread basket. the bread basket consisted of foccacia, strombolli with warm meat and cheese, bread with herb, basic rolls and sourdough. delicious!  they were served with mascarpone butter spread, citrus olive oil and eggplant spread.\n\nour server told us that they were best known for their spaghetti. hmmm, must try that next time. for appetizer, we started with the <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark>. \nfor our entrees, we ordered the <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark>  and prime ny steak.\nthe <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> was very tender and refreshing. used of rock salt gave it a unique after taste. i only wish there was more of it since it only came with 4 pieces. \nthe duck and <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark> was alright.   i absolutely wanted to love this dish due to the presence of foie gras, but i could barely taste the foie gras. the marsala reduction was a delightful contrast to the ravioli. \nthe steak was cooked to perfection. medium rare, the way i like it. however, i can't say that it was the best i've ever had. not even on my top three list.  it was served with seasonal vegetables such as carrots, tomatoes, roasted potatoes, wild mushrooms and parmigiano. we were told the  mushrooms were shitake , trumpet royale, beech, and pecorino mushroom. \n\nsince we were sharing everything, they were very accommodating by splitting everything for us.  the food timing was excellent! i wish i had more room for dessert but i was too full by the end of my meal.\noverall, i enjoyed my dining experience at scarpetta.", 
            "was here this past year for ces, and we had 2 events here.\none was our company dinner in the private room with a view of bellagio fountains and the other was a upper management meeting with a client over wine tasting in the private seating area which is in the kitchen.\n\nfor the wine tasting, it was pretty awesome, except the room is probably equipped to seat 8 people comfortably, maybe 10, we squeezed in 12.  we enjoyed some awesome wines and some desserts, which hey mistakenly sent to our table, so they ended up comping those and bringing more, it was very good.  \n\nthe cool thing about this private room, is that you have to walk through the kitchen to get to it and it is located next to the kitchen, with glass floor to ceiling so you can see into the kitchen as they work and cook and the background is a view of the bellagio fountains and the strip.  \n\nthe second occasion was for our company dinner a few nights later since they were able to accommodate our group of 16 in the private dining room that is in front of the restaurant and our big boss loves italian food.  \n\nalthough you can order single entrees off the menu, we had our waiter set up our dinner family style with some of his recommendations and some of the things we wanted to try.  \n\nalso, our big boss had a request for something off the menu and the chef obliged with no problems.  keeping the boss happy is always key!\n\nwe had the following dishes.\napps - braised short rib <mark>Braised Short Ribs of Beef</mark>, <mark>Creamy Polenta</mark>, <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> and <mark>Tuna susci</mark>\nthe short ribs and the polenta were my favorite, the susci was just ok.\n\nentrees - duck and <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark>, <mark>Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti</mark>, sheep milk ricotta agnolotti.  all were awesome, but the duck and <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark> is very rich.\n\nwe had dessert, but i don't actually remember what i had.\n\nservice was great and except the bar was slow, so they comped certain drinks that didn't show up in a time fashion.\n\nthe minus one star was for the sommelier, who seemed to enjoy the sound of his own voice and didn't really consider the requests of the guests at the table.  i understand he is very knowledgeable and he is an expert, but he could dial back the ego and work with the guest.  \n\nother than that, great place, i recommend it and you will not be disappointed.",

            "with so many cooking competition shows out there, i've always been curious how good some of these renowned chefs and judges really are.  certain guys clearly have the cred to back it up, but there are others i'm not as familiar with.  chopped's scott conant was one of the latter, but i can now say, without a hint of doubt, that...\n\nscott conant is bad ass.\n\nalthough it may not have been the original scarpetta in ny, my meal at this location was still pretty fantastic.  i'd even say they rank as one of my all around favorite restaurants, along with the spence in atlanta and state bird provisions in san francisco.  honestly, everything we had was terrific.  it's also easy now to see why scott conant is so tough on contestants who dare to cook pasta on the show - scarpetta's ranks as the best i've had thus far!\n\n-- bread basket...complimentary\n(http://www.<mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark>.com/biz_photos/scarpetta-las-vegas?select=dpyovdlwt4wm9gcaxo59yw#hyft6dlcgha332ecjchzlq)\nnot normally something i would bother mentioning because bread is bread.  that is, unless it's got salami baked into it.  well played scott conant, well played.\n\n-- roasted diver scallops with morels, sugar snap, watermelon radish and pea froth...$23\n(http://www.<mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark>.com/biz_photos/scarpetta-las-vegas?select=dpyovdlwt4wm9gcaxo59yw#v_vestj9d5uur3salouvza)\nmy friend and i split an order and our server was kind enough to have it plated separately for us.  the scallop had a near perfect sear (could have been harder) and the center couldn't have been cooked any better - soft and tender.  the pea froth complemented the scallop's sweetness quite well.\n\n-- <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark> with a marsala reduction...$27\n(http://www.<mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark>.com/biz_photos/scarpetta-las-vegas?select=dpyovdlwt4wm9gcaxo59yw#rj2lg-ukltloss3cpgcryq)\nsimply fantastic.  i was already dead set on ordering this, but it was nice to find out it was one of their signature dishes.  the ravioli was amazing - silky and tender with just the right bite.  although the foie gras filling was awesome on its own, the marsala reduction made it that much better!\n\n-- <mark>Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti</mark> with brown butter, horseradish, and toasted breadcrumbs...$26\n(http://www.<mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark>.com/biz_photos/scarpetta-las-vegas?select=dpyovdlwt4wm9gcaxo59yw#x9wafdf-qarvghjn7g-iya)\nmy friend ordered this one and it gave the ravioli a serious run for its money.  the pasta was just as good in this dish and the short rib added a nice bit of savoriness.  the breadcrumbs didn't do a ton for me, but it still tasted great.\n\n-- st<mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> souffl\\u00c9 with a rhubarb compote and vanilla gelato...$11\n(http://www.<mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark>.com/biz_photos/scarpetta-las-vegas?select=dpyovdlwt4wm9gcaxo59yw#uugjpj3_-6a9_rbmptbrsa)\nnot to gush like a little girl, but damn this was good!  i thought the compote and gelato would be too much sweetness, but the dish had just the right amount of sweetness and the souffl\\u00e9 had a perfect consistency.  i honestly don't know what else to say other than that you must get this.\n\nwhile the meal itself was amazing, i thought some of the hostesses could really use an attitude check.  for some reason, they seem to think they're better than everyone else and do very little to hide it.  it seems other <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> have left with the same impression, but at least our waiter christian and the rest of the wait staff more than made up for it.\n\nbeyond the food and service though, scarpetta might be worth a trip just to take in the view!  the dining room area (not the bar section) has giant bay windows that face the bellagio fountains and the strip (http://www.<mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark>.com/biz_photos/scarpetta-las-vegas?select=dpyovdlwt4wm9gcaxo59yw#3ol0vvlkty4ygbugubi7cw).  unfortunate i was only there with a friend instead of a girlfriend though (sorry bud).  scarpetta, i'll definitely be seeing you again during my next trip to vegas.  and considering how often i seem to be there, it'll probably be a lot sooner than later!", 
            "mike l below couldnt have said it any better regarding the scallops, the soup and the <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark>, the simple speghetti was amazing as well and the lobster piche was on point. just wish it wasnt located at the cosmo, so many fake people walking around pretending to be fake millionares.", 
            "during my first stay in vegas i knew i needed to plan out where i wanted to fine dine. after combing through many reviews i made a reservation at  scarpetta a week in advance. the three stars are given more for the ambience then the food. our table looked out to the bellagio and we were able to watch the fountain show as we dined. \n\ngreat disappointment fell over me as i began to eat the farmer's market salad. beautiful yes, full of wonder fresh veggies but unless you got a mouthful of pecorino in every bite it was severely under seasoned. \n\nwe both ordered pasta dishes. my bf the <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark> and i the short rib and <mark>Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti</mark>. the pasta itself was light and delicious. the marsala reduction on the duck foie gras was a little powerful over the duck flavor but overall a good dish. however, the horseradish flavor in the agnolotti was so overpowering it left my palette craving to be cleansed after each mouthful. \n \n\ni'm glad i tried scarpetta but based on this visit not sure i would be willing to give it another opportunity to disappoint.", 
            "authentic italian food and house made pasta--the only way to enjoy italian food. scarpetta was a lovely experience. the <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark> was great but the stand out was definitely the spaghetti--cooked to perfection. the orata (branzino) was nicely done, too. while i'd pass on the <mark>Chocolate Cake</mark> which tasted a bit generic, my favorite of the night was the pana cotta--delicious! the service was decent--slightly snobby but it comes with the territory. i'd love to dine here again.", 
            "i had a pleasant meal at the bar.  i got their mushroom polenta which was absolutely delicious.  the polenta was really creamy and the mushrooms flavored perfectly.  it complemented my <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark> really well.  the ravioli was not as good at the polenta.  i thought the skin was too thin, and the filling not substantial enough.  it was a smooth, light filling but i was left hungry after finishing it.  i probably should have gotten the other ravioli dish.\n\nfor dessert, the <mark>Coconut Panna Cotta</mark> with guava sauce and pineapples was a refreshing way to end the meal.", 
            "one of the best meals i've had in a long time....appropriately priced and amazing quality. the ambiance is amazing and the staff there is impeccably trained. even the bread (with the variety of spreads) will knock your socks off. just make sure to save room for the actual entrees...\n\nthe duck and <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark> is their signature dish and reasonably so. it's amazing. delicate and refined is probably the best way to describe it. \n\ncolorado lamb was amazing. the lamb was not gamey at all and the different components of the dish worked in harmony. i will admit that i still like the colorado lamb from stage restaurant in honolulu...\n\ni remember one of my friends having a really delicious pasta (mint infused?) but i can't remember all the details regarding it. i just remembered it was heavenly. \n\nst<mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> souffle was amazing. light, aromatic, and slightly sweet. it blew my socks off and definitely put maison akira's souffle to shame. \n\nzeppole are ahh-mayyy-ziing. deep fried dough nuggets (so light and airy!) filled with a rich nutella center. even if you're full, you need to get these...or you will regret it forever. \n\ndefinitely a great place to hit up for a bite to eat when you're in vegas. i definitely will be returning during my next trip!", 
            "this place has ruined me. i'm never going to be able to eat dried pasta again, only the fresh stuff for this girl. but seriously, they must have italian grandmas cranking out homemade pasta by the pound. easily the best italian food i've had. definitely an upscale place. i've had several food items (spaghetti, foie gras and <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark>, ribeye, multiple glasses of wine, <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark>, pici, short ribs, and the dessert doughnuts) and every single thing is delicious. service is perfect, i was never in want of anything. servers are knowledgeable and passionate about what they're serving. also wonderful wine recommendations. something that i din't expect is getting the best steak i've had in this city here. their ribeye is without a doubt the finest piece of red meat i've had in my life. if stk is too busy (it is), but you still want a great steak, come on over to scarpetta. you will not be disappointed. another great thing to mention is the view. wanna wow your lady with a great view of the bellagio fountains? make a reservation and request it.",

            "wife and i decided to try this establishment during our trip to vegas, first weekend of april.  all i can say is from top to bottom, fantastic.  the ambiance, the service, the food all top rate.  the greeter/hostess at the door wasn't overly warm but i can get over that usually if the food and ambiance is good.  \n\nwe could only get a 6 pm seating on a thursday (and i booked a week ahead) so i thought that was a good sign.  when we got there it was empty.  we got a great seat by the window.   it started to fill up during our seating.  we got a fantastic basket of breads and spreads almost right away.  the best bread i have ever had in a restaurant bar none.  i could go either way on bread before a meal, but this was outstanding.  \n\nmy wife got the tagliatelle which was light, yet filling enough for her to be full enough so i could play clean up at the end.  it was fantastic.  i had the duck and <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark>.  wow.  had a wonderful balsamic like reduction on.  they don't wow you with portion sizes, but i did not think one \"boy am i getting ripped off here.\"  honestly the last thing i like doing is wasting food and in vegas i don't want to be walking around with a to go box after a meal.  i'd say it was perfect portion sizes for the dollar.  \n\nthe service was superb.  almost too good.   we were in and out in an hour which was a little disappointing because we had a great seat in the place.  but that is the business.  turn over.  i will say we didn't linger either as it was our first night in las vegas.  \n\ndefinitely recommended for people who want more from their pasta than the olive garden has to offer.", 
            "late review from dinner in feb.  \n\ngreat ambiance and view of the bellagio fountains.   order the <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark> or <mark>Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti</mark>.   favors are incredible!   even the bread basket is amazing.   pricey but definitely worth it.   cosmopolitan has a great selection of restaurants.", 
            "fine dining at it's finest!\n\ncame here a saturday night during my last trip to vegas for a bachelorette party (apparently we weren't the only ones) and we were seated right in the middle on a long table which was nice for a party of 7 girls. our waiter and busers were on point and our waiter was really nice and always conversated with us and made our experience fab!\n\nlet's talk about that bread basket...how crazy is it that they actually have salami in one of the breads. they also have sourdough and herb focaccia  . they have butter, olive oil and this roasted tomato eggplant as a spread to go with the variety of bread they give. i liked the herb focaccia bread the best with the butter...it was toasted and soft in a small square (good for portion size). for my meal i got the <mark>Black Cod</mark> with tomato's and fennel because i love butterfish and i only eat seafood and i love vegetables...although i was debating on getting this or the halibut, i'm glad i went with this because it was so divine! i wish the portion was bigger but it's one of those restaurants where it's quality over quantity. we ordered 2 whites and 1 bottle of reds that night, and because my stomach was not having it, i only drank a glass of the 1st bottle. some of the girls ordered the lobster, scallop appetizers, split <mark>Chilled Pea Soup</mark>, foi <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark> and steak and everyone said everything they ordered was great. for desserts we got the hazelnut mini donuts, st<mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> cheesecake/shortcake in a cup dessert over a bed of crystallized sugar...i didn't get to try any of them but everything was all gone so it must've been delicious. \n\n\noverall the ambiance is beautiful, food is amazing/drinks and bread, awesome service and fine dining at it's finest. the portions are a little small and the price is a little pricey but worth it especially when it's a special occasion like a birthday, anniversary, valentines day, mothers day or bachelorette dinner =)", 
            "my girlfriends brought me here for my bachelorette dinner. our server titus was awesome and they had a pretty decent wine list.\n\nthe food fell a little flat for me. \n\nthe complimentary bread basket was phenomenal. my favorite was the focaccia with prosciutto.  bread came with three different spreads: whipped butter mascarpone, eggplant caponata and a lemon infused olive oil.  thy were all delicious but i especially enjoyed the eggplant caponata.\n\ni ordered the wagyu beef tartare as my appetizer. the beef wasn't as red as i would've liked it to be. it looked brown but i couldn't tell if it was from the bad lighting of the restaurant. the dish had no flavor and i basically had to force myself to eat it.\n\ni ordered the duck and <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark> with a marsala reduction for my entree. i like that they make their own fresh pasta but the dish lacked the debt of flavor you'd expect from the components of this dish. it was like waiting for a climax that never came.\n\nmy friend really enjoyed her <mark>Chilled Pea Soup</mark> but the other girls didn't really rave about their dishes. \n\nthe desserts (i forgot which ones we ordered) were great! we all definitely enjoyed that. \n\nthe restaurant's decor is okay. it's somewhere between modern and classic. the lighting is really bad... or good if you like it on the darker side. i like being able to see my food when i eat.", 
            "nothing like fresh pasta made in house! came here with girlfriends and had top notch service. we all chose a buddy and split our apps/entrees, and scarpetta was nice enough to halve our plates for us! \n\ndefinitely recommend the truffled <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark>! \n\nthe wine list was beautiful but appallingly marked up (300%). so we brought our own vino! ($35 corkage fee)", 
            "simply amazing.\n\n\nthere is a very tough choice when dining at the cosmo because they have amazing offerings.  scarpetta is one of those choices that i believe is a must.\n\nthe ambiance is very nice, and if you get there at a good time, you can request a table by the window overlooking the bellagio fountains for some dinner entertainment.\n\nthere were 7 of us in my party, so i got to try quite a few things.  service was on par with any high end restaurant which is good.\n\nbread - they give you four variations of bread, all good.  the standout is the stromboli.  the bread comes with three dips which are eggplant, olive oil with lime and marscapone butter.  the eggplant dip was amazing.\n\nsteak tartar - this dish was fabulous and is my main recommendation for appetizer.  it is perfectly seasoned and finished off with a tiny quail egg on top. the toast points are also seasoned, buttered and toasted to add that buttery nutty flavor to the bite.\n\nfried lemon grass and char - this dish was unique.  it was little strands tempura-like fried bits of lemon grass and fish mixed together.  i said char because i believe that is what it was, but i cannot be for certain.  it was very simple and very good but i could take it or leave it for the price.\n\nscallops - careful with this dish as you only get two.  i understand they are a luxury type item but for 21$ or how much ever it was, two scallops did not go a long way.  they were your average good scallop.\n\nfoie gras & <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark> - the star of the night.  this dish was simply perfect.  from flavor balance, quantity of food, to execution...it was a hit.  if you come here and don't at least try it, you are missing out.\n\nfilet - the filet was cook medium rare (which is the way i like it) and was very soft as it should be.  that being said, it was a filet.  a normal good filet that you can get from any great steakhouse.  the star of that dish was actually the accompanying potatoes.  mashed with garlic, sauteed spinach, sun dried tomatoes and a cheese that i could not recognize.\n\nchicken - ok yes, someone ordered chicken.   the one dish everyone always passes over at restaurants because...well, its chicken.  that being said, i was given about a fourth of the chicken because they were full and i must admit.  it was tasty as hell.  the skin is cooked on it to make it very crispy with seasonings that go a long way.  the bird itself was moist so that you had to use hardly any effort for it to shred apart in your mouth.  if i ever ordered chicken in a restaurant, this would be the one.  its also a huge portion in terms of high end restaurant portions.\n\ni would go back here in a heart beat.", 
            "the boys and i had a very good, relaxing meal here last friday night.  very nice restaurant in cosmo restaurant row. place is classy but not the least bit stuffy. like everyone mentions, the bread selection is great. mini stromboli's w/ sides of marscapone, tomato/garlic...really good. went through several of the pasta dishes for the table to begin. duck and foi <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark>, risotto w/ short rib and short rib and bone marrow angolotti all good to excellent. nothing better than home made pasta. polenta w/ truffled mushrooms might have been even better that the pasta dishes...must try! i had the <mark>Veal Loin</mark> and pork belly. the loin was a bit dry, but flavorful..the pork belly was spectacular.  friends had steak and halibut, all were very happy. wine list is amazing..tons of italian wines...pricey! found a good bottle for around $100.  overall, pretty reasonably priced meal for vegas.  good stuff scott!", 
            "my wife and i dined here and really enjoyed the experience.  while we weren't seated near the window, we could still see the fountain and a lot of the view of the strip. the staff was friendly and accommodating and the food was delicious.  i highly recommend the <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark>, and any of the house made pasta for that matter.  one recommendation would be to make reservations as early as possible as the restaurant appears to be very popular and is relatively small.", 
            "this place offers a first class dining experience. my fave restaurant in sin city by far!\n\ni come to this restaurant pretty much every time i go to vegas (that is pretty often) and have ordered many things off the menu. however, i keep going back to the duck and <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark>. omg it is so freakin good! the paste of duck and fois gras in it is so smooth and silky within the ravioli pasta which is perfectly cooked al dente. then comes the balsamic marsala sauce on top which is slightly sweet but not overpowering.", 
            "it was good!\nwent with 4 girlfriends last night, and all were pleased.\nthe ambiance was nice and the service was great! it was really what set the experience apart from lesser fine-dining options, as opposed to the food.\n\nthe duck/<mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark> was definitely the star at our table.\ntwo people ordered the spaghetti, which i tried. it was definitely tasty, but not hype-worthy. \nother dishes hit the table- the scallop and short rib appetizers are small, and the short rib wasn't amazing. i didn't try a scallop.\ni had the jidori chicken (because i never order chicken and saw another review that insisted). very good!\n\nrecommended generally.", 
            "oh...my...god! fine dining literally at it's finest. \n\nthis scott conant restaurant is located on the third floor at the cosmopolitan. when i walked in, first thing i thought was \"wow this is it? it's so tiny!\" but then we were lead to the back area and we had a nice view of gigantic wine wall and the water show at the bellagio. \n\nthe food is sooooo good...even the bread was awesome. my favorite was the bread with salami wrapped into it. we ordered the <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> appetizer, foie gras and <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark>, lamb loin, and filet mignon. the <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> was super delicious and delicate..and more important super fresh! i am not a huge fan of pasta of any sort but wowwww...add foie gras and duck and call me a fan! everything about this dish was amazing! it's nice and buttery and rich and all kinds of deliciousness...*drools*. filet was cooked perfectly, but my favorite dish of the night was the lamb. i was pretty damn full by the time the meat came out but it was too good to stop eating. it was cooked to a perfect medium rare and it was crusted really nicely and it was seasoned really well. oh btw they sell half (375 ml)  bottles of wine as well people so for those of you want more than one glass one wine but won't be able to finish a regular sized bottle! \n\nthe customer service deserves an a+. they really went above and beyond. we told them we just wanted to share everything that came out and normally in that case we would expect to be picking off each other's plates, but they went the extra mile to split everything and plate it as though it was an individual meal. they did such a great job when the meat entree came out i was like \"what we only ordered one\" but the waiter came by and joked \"you like how i split the filet perfectly in two?\" \n\nscarpetta is seriously one of the best dining experience i've ever had and it's so rare to find great food with an equally great staff. i will be back for sure when i go back to vegas (which is like once or twice a year seeing as las vegas and california are neighbors)", 
            "handsome and i are celebrating our annual vegas trip this weekend and this review is a year overdue!! \n\nwe stayed at the cosmopolitan and we really wanted to eat at scarpetta. we love chopped and scott conant is one of our favorites. his restaurant is located on the third level of the cosmo. \n\nwe walked in and we had a reservation so we were seated promptly right by the window and we could see the bellagio fountain. it was so romantic. \n\nwe ordered wine (i don't remember which one) but it was amazing. for our starter we got the <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> and the duck and <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark>. both were spectacular. \n\nfor dinner handsome ordered the veal three ways and i ordered the <mark>Pan Roasted Halibut</mark>. handsome loved his veal and my halibut melted in my mouth.\n\nfor dessert we orders the rhubarb souffl\\u00e9 and i think that was handsome's favorite part. it was so light and fluffy with such a delicious flavor. \n\nour whole experience at scarpetta was amazing from start to finish. we will definitely be back.", 
            "scarpetta never disappoints!  above and beyond friendly service and amazing food.  we started with the scallops.  they were roasted with just the amount of crust.  next was were the braised shorts ribs - tender and so much flavor!  the <mark>Creamy Polenta</mark> with mushrooms - omg!  i so want to lick my plate!  i had the duck and <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark> - rich and smooth and yummy!  my gf had the lobster pasta.  the pasta was perfect with a delicious spicy sauce (i know because i \"helped\" my friend out when she stepped out!)  for dessert, we shared the <mark>Coconut Panna Cotta</mark>.  it was a sprint, our spoons flying.  next time, we will get our own!",

            "a very nice alternative if you want a break from the vegas buffets!  the <mark>Creamy Polenta</mark> with truffled mushrooms was amazing.  had the duck and <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark> and it was equally as amazing....a bit rich but not overly rich where you felt sick after.  was able to polish off the entire dish with no problem - and the portion was pretty generous considering you're at a high-end restaurant.  normally at great italian places they tend to skimp on the portions but they didn't.  my mom had the <mark>Black Cod</mark> and that was tasty as well.....but since their pasta is fresh i would recommend trying one of their pastas.  bread basket was great, they have this salami bread that was awesome!  \n\ndefinitely have to try the one in beverly hills now!", 
            "food:\n<mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark>:  a mediocre sized dish, with oily ravioli stuffed with slim slivers of <mark>Spiced Duck Breast</mark> and foie gras. maybe foie gras is not meant to be cooked, but it was not a 5 star experience. despite my description it was good, but not great. i would expect more for what i am paying. \n\nbbq ribs and bone marrow pasta: another ok meal, with the small chunks of meat in them. \n\nseared scallop: very delicious. this was a wonderful appetizer, it set the par at which i was expecting the rest of the food to be at, unfortunately nothing did. very juicy, and the bacon wrapping it was just the right amount of crispy.\n\nservice:\ni hated the service, we had some snobby waiter that was quite rude. no help with description of food, not even a smile. i just didn't like him. our waters were refilled once. this is a fine dining restaurant, i expect my water to be filled each time i reach half way. for las vegas standards this place failed miserably. i sit at the far end of restaurant in bachi burger and my water gets filled constantly. any restaurant, fine dining or not, the people serve with a smile. the food runners were nice enough though. the service did not meet the standards one would expect at a restaurant like this.\n\nthe restaurant:\nwe had a pretty nice view of the bellagio water works. we were one table away from the window, but it was still nice. the decor was nice too, i liked the way set up, the tables seemed to be stacked higher and higher as they went away from the window. chandeliers were very fancy. the decor met vegas standards. \n\nall in all probably not going back, not worth the money.", 
            "i was actually really excited about this place, but to much avail, this place is mediocre at best.\n\ni really think this place is over-hyped. the food here is marginal and the prices exorbitant than its actually worth. i got the duck and <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark>, which was ok but not quite flavorful. after trying cucina enoteca in irvine, ca, i always have to compare every italian place to it and scarpetta cannot compete. cucina enoteca is always a good half price cheaper! \n\ni also am not a fan of their service. my wine was forgotten and only came at the tail end of my dinner. for $18 a glass, this is unacceptable. i know waiters work long hours but it seem like everyone was crabby who worked there.\n\ni'll have to say though, the window view is pretty good as it faces the fountain of the bellagio.", 
            "well the view alone makes this a spectacular dining experience. ask to sit near the window when making reservations so you have a nice view of the bellagio fountains at night. we started off with the <mark>Creamy Polenta</mark> with mushrooms and oh sweet god was it delicious. every single bite was amazing. we then ordered the <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark> and the spaghetti with marinara sauce. i know spaghetti sounds like such a simple thing to order but our waiter was raving about it. he was right- it was done to perfection. i will have to try the scarpetta in nyc and see how it compares", 
            "i was in vegas over the 4th of july weekend with some friends and family. we decided to give scarpetta a try since it sounded nice and was close to our hotel. the restaurant is beautiful and the wait staff was great (very friendly, polite and professional). the view from the restaurant is on the bellagio fountains, which was very nice (you actually get a nice panoramic view of part of the strip). as for the food, i was pleasantly surpised. i had the <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark> and it was quite nice. my girlfriend had the pici pasta which was absolutely amazing! if you are in vegas and looking to have a nice dinner i would say head over to scarpetta.", 
            "the ambiance and view of the las vegas strip was amazing! i've tasted so many different <mark>Spaghetti</mark> and the only spaghetti that i've ever liked is my moms and the one at scarpetta. the sauce was just a perfect taste. my sister had the <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark> and my other sister had the short rib and <mark>Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti</mark> which both dishes were amazing. the food came out in less than ten minutes. the waiters were very attentive.", 
            "scarpetta is a lovely italian restaurant inside the cosmopolitan. we were seated near the entrance but still had a good view of the bellagio fountains which became more spectacular as it grew darker outside. they had a nice assortment of bread to start along with a healthy list of specials that included diver scallops and foie gras, which my husband ordered. i started with the white corn soup with dungeness crab which was sweet, buttery and one of the best soups i've ever tasted. for my main course, i ordered the duck and <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark>. my dish might have been better if i didn't try my husband's dish which had actual pieces of seared foie gras. holy duck liver, batman! with my dish, i thought that combining the duck and the liver in the ravioli just muddied the flavors of both food items that i found so enjoyable. we finished the meal off with coffee and shared a delightfully light mascarpone cheesecake.\n\nthe prices are a bit high, as expected from a fine dining establishment on the strip, yet not prohibitive. the service was spot on, warm and unobtrusive. let the waitstaff know if you are vegetarian or on a gluten-free diet and they will provide you a separate menu.",

            "amazing!!! one of my all time favorite dinners and i go out to eat a lot. the portions are on the smaller side but hey when you're in vegas you don't need a big stuffing meal, need to save some room for drinks :)\n\nwe ordered the short rib appetizers' with polenta (very small portion). they were beyond anything else i've tried. everything just melted in my mouth. for dinner i ordered the mushroom raviolis i think it was called <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark>. again this plate was just outstanding nothing like anything i've ever had before. the grated cheese literally foamed on the plate. i can't stop talking about this meal and recommending this restaurant to others. \n\nanother plus was the window seating which had beautiful views of the vegas strip. the place is dimly lit so adds a romantic feel.", 
            "<mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> fail. \n\nthis was my girlfriend's first time in las vegas, so i wanted to bring her to an upscale place and have her try some food from supposedly exclusive restaurants in vegas. based on the <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> reviews, and time availability, i chose scarpetta. it was a major disappointment, and i felt so bad bringing her to this establishment. this was the first restaurant experience she had in vegas and it was horrendous. \n\nlet me say that this review is based on three dishes that we had at scarpetta. \n\n1. duck and <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark> (main course)\n2. <mark>Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti</mark> (main course)\n3. roasted diver scallops (appetizer)\n\nambiance:\n\nthe seating and view were great. we were the table almost next to the window where the belagio water show was going on. there was a great view of the show. the lighting was also dim. it is definitely a nice place to bring a date.\n\nprice:\n\ndespite the $$$, the prices are not too outrageous for las vegas. the main course dishes were 25 and 26 dollars while the roasted scallops were 23 dollars. \n\nservice:\n\nservice was horrible. we were there for over an hour. our waiter checked up on us twice, once to bring more water and the second time to see if our food was ready. we waited for about 15-20 minutes to get our scallop appetizer. no apologies or more complementary bread. the wait for the food seemed the norm, as the tables next to us finished their food and were just making small talk while waiting for over 20 minutes. after we finished our scallops, we proceeded to wait another almost 30 minutes for our main course. again, no apologies or further check ups. i ran out of water while waiting for our main course, during the appetizer, and did not get a refill until i had to ask for one (after the main course came). when we wanted to tell the waiter about the problems with our main courses, he and other waiters could not be found for about 20 minutes. we just sat there looking at each other and our plates (almost untouched). simply horrible.\n\nfood:\n\nscallops - these were actually very good. they were simple scallops that were fresh and cooked well. i would definitely get this again.\n\nduck and <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark> - came out cold, tough, and very very very salty. we have had foie gras before, and this was well beyond what it was supposed to taste like. it left a bitter and salty taste in the mouth that could only be drowned out by eating the complimentary bread with their house tomato sauce. my girlfriend did not want to waste food so she tried to put the ravioli in her mouth followed by water as a chaser. she soon became sick and had to go to the bathroom. she only finished about 1/3 of the plate before i told her to stop. \n\n<mark>Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti</mark> - gross. the noodles were tough and cold. the sauce made the bread crumbs stick to the noodles and caused the noodles to stick together like one giant pasta. i had trouble eating one bite of it. after finally taking a bit, the food was bland and left an unpleasant aftertaste. it was one of the worst dishes i have had in a long time. i am usually not too picky with pasta, but this agnolotti was inedible. the noodles were rubbery hard and the sauce was cold and crusted onto the noodles. the appearance did not help. the food looked like someone threw up on the plate. the sauce was black or very dark brown (could not tell because of the dim lighting), but the appearance made the food even less appetizing. \n\nconclusion of the meal:\n\nafter about 20 minutes of the food being on the plate, almost completely untouched, the waiter came by to ask \"how was everything tasting.\" i told the waiter that the food was inedible and that it was probably the worst thing i've had in recent memory. the waiter's face was priceless. he did not seem shocked at all, rather, he just appeared to be apologetic. the waiter took the food off our table and asked if we wanted anything else. at this point, the restaurant was about to close and we did not want to wait another 30 minutes to get some inedible food. i told him to just give me the check so we can get out of there. they took the two dishes off our bill and our almost 2 hour meal came out to a whopping $23 (for the scallops). what a waste of time and appetite.\n\nthis trend of inedible food was not isolated to only our table table. while waiting for our food, the table behind us asked for the check and had two dishes that were inedible and left untouched as well. i did hear that the fish was decent from the table behind us, but that was the extent of praise scarpetta's food received. \n\noverall:\n\ni felt the need to write a long rant about this place. this dinner was supposed to be a happy and memorable event for my girlfriend because it was her very first dinner in vegas. instead, it was only memorable because of how bad the restaurant service and food were. considering there are a ton of great great places in vegas, i would highly advise anyone to pass on scarpetta.", 
            "tucked away in the cosmo, this restaurant is intimate and has a great view of the bellagio fountain. i made reservations through opentable and it worked just fine. we even arrived a bit early but they had our table ready and were able to seat us right away. we had an awesome seat by the window across from the fountain and basically had dinner and a show. it was perfect. service was good, water was constantly filled, plates taken away and made sure we were doing okay. food was so-so... yes, i said it... it was just okay. i had the duck and <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark> and the bf had the <mark>Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti</mark>. i actually enjoyed his dish more than my own.. but both pastas were only okay. somewhat lacked flavor, or i just might be more of a tomato sauce kind of girl. i did however enjoy their assortment of bread and the butter, and other dipping sauces they had. that was delicious and we had to have two servings of that. we also had a caesar salad which was delicious and had a hint of lemon flavor that was refreshing.", 
            "hidden on the third floor of the cosmopolitan, scarpetta is the place to visit to learn what really good pasta can be like.\n\nas a pasta fiend, i am very picky when it comes to pasta.  scarpetta has shown me another dimension to pasta that i must learn.  the minimalist approach where pasta is the star, and the sauce or other items are addendums.\n\nallow me to expound:\n\nsignature spaghetti: normally a staple of the american diet, lifted from italy, it is most commonly served with tomato, carbonara, or meat sauce. since i make spaghetti at home, i always believed in what i thought i liked.  this dish showed me that a very simple, light sauce can accompany the pasta and \"show it off\" in a way that the pasta shines above the sauce.  a large portion is not required as the fresh pasta is rich and heavy.  the sauce is light, and delicately flavorful, allowing the pasta flavor to come out instead of being more of a \"texture\" experience.  when presented with this dish, one might think \"where is the sauce?\", but when finished the response will be: \"i didn't miss it\"\n\nduck & <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark>:  again, simple in presentation and execution, the difference is in the details.  i normally don't like duck, and find foie gras to be overly rich and intense when served alone.  the blended filling, in just the right proportion to pasta was a grand pleasure and i will be looking or any excuse to have this dish again.  again, the sauce is minimal at best and the dish relies on the pasta and filling almost entirely to achieve its goal.\n\nlesson learned: extravagant sauces are used to cover up mediocre pasta offerings\n\nappetizer bonus: <mark>Creamy Polenta</mark> with fricassee of mushroom: this dish, served in a moderately small portion was a flavor and texture experience that reinforces the axiom that quality is small amounts is the most flavorful, and healthy for you experience.  having watched its manufacture on the food channel, the secret is in the long prep.  like tamahagane, it must be nurtured for hours (3) to achieve the complete assimilation of the polenta kernel into the dish, resulting in a creaminess of exceptional quality.\n\nall in all, i learned the perception of the minimalist, the discipline of the stalwart, and the reminder that food is art in the presentation.\n\nmy most basic position:  i will look for any excuse to visit scarpetta in the future.\n\nsundries:  as with any restaurant of this caliber, service was impeccable.  even though i dined alone on several occasions, several people inquired as to my satisfaction each visit.  i cannot say enough.  as a lone diner, i felt as attended to as any other party and normally i can't stand eating alone as one tends to get treated like a pariah.  not the case here!", 
            "this is the best food that i've eaten all year. i couldn't get enough of the  <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark> and scallops. the cocktails were perfect. i have nothing but great things to say about this place.", 
            "i cannot wait to go back!! every bite of the <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark> was delectable, i cant describe how good it was. i also tried the berry cocktail which quenched my thirst and gave me the buzz i needed. and let me warn you about the <mark>Chocolate Cake</mark>...it's dangerous!! (in a good way).", 
            "there are so many options to think about at the cosmopolitan when it comes to dining.  if you are thinking about a romantic dinner overlooking the bellagio fountains, this the restaurant to choose.\n\nadditionally when you go before christmas the hotels all tend to put their restaurants on a rotation since it is slow season.  scarpetta had been closed for 10 days until the night we went.  when i had made my reservations i mentioned it was my gal's birthday and would like a seat near the window.\n\nwe got there for our reservation and a table with 3 people showed up after us.  they were given a window seat.  we were given a table 3 rows away from the window and next to the waiter station.  we had a limited view of the bellagio fountains. the place is pretty dressy casual and there were a couple who had old jeans on sitting by the window.\n\nwe were limited on time as we were trying to catch a show at the bellagio.  the one thing to note is that our waiter was attentive to that point and never pushed us on dessert, but did apologize a couple times for the slowness of the kitchen during the meal.\n\nwe ordered our drinks as well as our meal in one fell swoop. as we were in a rush at the night was young, we ordered the <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> and <mark>Tuna susci</mark> with caviar for appetizers and  had the duck and <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark> and diver scallops with foie gras for main courses.  everything came out slow and we were rushed!  we had two drinks before appetizers finally came and i knew something was wrong and didnt want to ruin the evening.\n\nthey brought out the <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> but then a full tin of russian caviar with toast points...etc.  fortunately we love caviar.  unfortunately this was not going to be a simple $150 meal!!!  i did not want to and maybe should have said something but we had had a few drinks and i did nit want to ruin the special evening planned any more.  \n\nthe duck and <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark> was good but not as great as it sounds.  it was just too tempting to resist. i love duck and i love foie gras but i guess it didn't work well together for me.  the scallops were good too.  now that california has lifted its ban on foie gras i can now more easily pass when i see it on menus.  the <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> appetizer was just okay as well.\n\nnow the caviar was awesome but it is something i would rather have at a nice cocktail party and not on my own dime.  i am still wondering how that was put on my ticket because it was nowhere on any menus i saw.  my $19 dish turned into a $225 dish and my bill came to over $500 for two!  ugh!!!\n\nyes it was a special night, but very costly!",

            "four and half stars!! \n\ni love italian food and have been to many italian restaurants in town: piero's, fiamma, parma by chef marc, casa diamore, nora's, gantaeno's, lavo, carmine, roma deli, panevino, pasta mia, wolfgang puck pizzeria and etc. although i like certain dishes from some of previous listed restaurants but after dining here last night, i found my absolutely favorite italian in town. \n\nfood:\ni love love bread and omg, their bread was so amazing. the texture of the bread was perfect. the bread basket came with various bread; rosemary, cheese, white and etc. rosemary bread was crispy and fluffy. cheese one was chewy and flavorful. the  eggplant basil dipping sauce that came with it was incredible good. i even put some in the spaghetti.  \n\nappetizer \n1. scallop and foie gras (3/5): i have to say i was not impressed by their foie gras. scallop was not bad. grilled pear was interesting though. don't think i will order again.\n2: <mark>Creamy Polenta</mark>(4:5): ordered this dish because it's popular on <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark>. the truffle mushroom that came on top made this dish absolutely delicious. i would prefer polenta was not so liquidity. \n3: grilled spanish octopus and squid (5/5): it was light and fresh. love the smoked paprika vinaigrette and chickpea that came with it too. \n\nentrees\n1. spaghetti with tomato and basil(4/5): like other <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> said, they cook it al dente here. it was just simple and amazing. i added some eggplants from the dipping sauce :p.\n2. duck and <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark> (3.8/5): it was tasty in general but i couldn't taste much flavor from duck or foie. masala reduction and cheese saved the dish though. \n3. short rib and <mark>Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti</mark>(5/5): it was my favorite entree of the night. toasted breadcrumbs and brown butter made this dish so heavenly. \n4. branzino (3/5): my friend ordered this dish and he liked it. i tried a bite and it was too fishy for me.\n5. lamb loin (4:5): i do not eat lamb but tried a bite from my friends plate and it was not gamy. lamb lover should definitely give it a try. \n6. pici (4/5): great flavor. the tarragon and chilled pesto made this dish very yummy although i wish i see more lobster.  \n\ndessert\nall yummy across the board! \n1. banana souffl\\u00e9 (5/5): perfect amount of sweetness from the souffl\\u00e9 although i'm not a fan of rum gelato. \n2. <mark>Coconut Panna Cotta</mark> (5/5): very interesting concept with the guava juice as they called it \"soup\".\n3. citrus parfait (5/5): very refreshing after the meal. it's like yuzu sorbet.  \n\nservice was attentive but the service was not bit cold. i don't feel like our waiter was welcoming and patient enough. feel like he's there to do his job and leave. no smiles either. maybe he had a bad day. \n\ni will keep trying other italian restaurants but i can see myself coming back frequently.", 
            "i'm not a big fan of pasta because i usually try to avoid carbs. i see it as a waste of valuable tummy space that i should reserve for other food. but i have to give it to scarpetta for changing my mind.\n\nwe came here in a group of six on a sunday night. we made reservations like two hours prior, but we showed up about an hour early and were seated immediately. \n\nright away, we were impressed by the variety of the bread basket and the dips. i can't remember exactly but there were about six different types of bread. what really got our attention though was the eggplant dipping sauce! it was so yummy that we kept shamelessly asking for more. i think we got at least three refills of it (but hey, we had six hungry girls!).\n\non to the real food... my friend and i shared the lobster pici and the short rib and <mark>Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti</mark>. the pici is dressed with a chili pesto sauce, and since my friend can't eat spicy foods, they split the portion for us and served it on two separate plates. i got extra chili pesto on the side in case i wanted to add more. i loved that we didn't have to try and split our dish in half ourselves. so much more convenient and i can get straight down to eating! however, it turns out that the chili pesto sauce isn't even spicy at all. if anything, it's just salty, like really salty. the pieces of lobster meat still tasted good and wasn't that salty, but the pasta sat directly in the pesto and it definitely could've used less sauce/salt.\n\nnow on to the short rib and <mark>Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti</mark>... it was the last entree to come out! all the food came out already and the agnolotti was nowhere to be seen. we got sidetracked by the lobster pici and kind of forgot about our 2nd entree to share. when we realized, we asked the server where it was and if the kitchen had forgotten about it, but he assured us it will be coming out shortly. by the time it came out, everyone was done with their food. i'd say it came out 10-15 mins later than the other entrees. it wasn't so bad considering we were sharing another entree, but had we not shared, one of us would've sat there without food. considering this is a fine dining restaurant, that is unacceptable. \n\nbut you know what, it was so delicious that i didn't care it was late. i think this has become my favorite pasta dish of all time. the flavor was very rich and smooth, with a little crunchy texture from the garlic chips. i personally liked it better than the duck and <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark> that i tried from my friend's plate. i would order this again and again. luckily for me, there's also a scarpetta in ny! guess where i'll be going to dinner soon!", 
            "oh scott!! when is the last time you did quality control??? i'm a huge fan of yours as i love the food network.  i've been itching to try out scarpetta for a while and made it a priority during my vegas trip!!\n\nomg!  everything was bad.  i mean bad!!! the service was bad and lacking and the food didn't save the day either.  let's just say i'd expected much more from you and maybe a meal at olive garden would've been a better choice. there was absolutely no seasoning in all of the dishes and the focaccia bread was drowned in oil.  the saving grace is probably your specialty bread.  \n\nwe ordered the <mark>Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti</mark> and <mark>Crispy Fritto Misto</mark> as appetizers and both were mediocre at best.  for entrees i ordered the duck and fois <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark> and omg, i couldn't eat more than 4 pieces of it and i'm known to polish my plates.  my hubby had the octopus and it was ok but lacked seasoning again.  my daughter had your world famous tomato sauce pasta and the pasta was tough and needed salt!  is it a bad day or is it normally like this?\n\nhands down the worst meal in vegas.  huge disappointment!!!", 
            "terrific dining experience on the strip! service and food were excellent. they sat us at a table with a breathtaking view of the bellagio's fountains next door and the northside of the strip - what a great way to get us to stay longer and spend more $$$ \n\nmy wife and i ordered split plates (which they were happy to do - as elegantly as if you had ordered individual plates) which allowed us to try several dishes and still have room for desert. their selection of freshly baked breads was delicious and included focaccia and other assorted italian breads. since this was our first time dining here, we played it pretty safe with our selections. we shared the roasted beat salad, burrata, duck & <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark>, and sirloin. for dessert: we shared an italian version of a beignet the name of which i can't remember. it was served a la mode and it was delish. \n\nall in all, i can't wait to return to try some of the more intriguing items on the menu.",

            "solid. never knew how \"gourmet\" pasta could get, but yes it surely can to that level. believe it. \n\nentrees:\n<mark>Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti</mark>: this dish was perfection. the little ravioli-like pieces were well stuffed with flavorful short rib and the toasted breadcrumbs were the perfect topper. totally recommended.\nduck & <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark>: the richness of the filling makes it a dish to remember. c'mon it's foie gras! may be too fatty/heavy for one, but a delectable dish to share. \nspaghetti: took a bite of my friend's. pretty damn good for a traditional spaghetti dish, but it's really not like your mama's spaghetti at all. them al dente noodles were on point. \nchicken: chicken is just chicken, to me. wasn't particularly exciting.\nprime filet <mark>Braised Short Ribs of Beef</mark>: this was another item for our table. pieces of steak were cooked med-rare, which made the pieces juicy. good, but not \"steak-house good.\"\n\nthe desserts were shared were the grapefruit <mark>Coconut Panna Cotta</mark> and bombolini. both were so delicious! i'm typically hesitant about ordering fancy dessert, but these were worth it! \n\nin addition, we got the perfect view of the bellagio water show from our table. and to top it all off, our server (a mid-aged asian man) was incredible hospitable, genuine in his recommendations and considerate of our party's needs. the service really made it a great experience for our bachelorette's dinner. \n\nscarpetta, thanks for making our vegas trip a classy one.",

            "scarpetta fits well in the sophisticated cosmopolitan hotel. tucked away into a corner, this restaurant is unassuming at first approach. the lights are dim and there are curvy booths on the right side facing a long bar. the walkway is narrow but keep the eye on the prize at the end because that's where the true \"meat\" of the restaurant is. tables and booths are snugly placed in a modern yet cozy dining area. for our group of 10, the broad shouldered guys probably felt a little too close for comfort to make room for all of us to fit, but it wasn't a problem for the girls. \n\nlast saturday, we were in a mad rush to eat and run because we were trying to catch a 9:30pm showing of ka at mgm. our dinner reservation was 7:30pm so we cut it close. we asked the waiter to divide our check between 5 couples and to make things worse, we did not sit next to our significant others. we brushed off the sommelier by accident because we wanted to find our waiter just to order right away. in spite of our group being a nightmare, they made our plans happen and with time to boot! the food was amazing, our checks were split perfectly, and the waiter even offered detailed directions how to get to our show quicker. \n\nthe duck fois <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark> and the <mark>Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti</mark> were the two dishes my husband and i shared. we loved these dishes. the guys in our group ordered steaks which were all well prepared and the girls ordered appetizers and a couple dishes to share but i think bry and i were the happiest out of the group with our choices, which is surprising because i always choose steak over anything. \n\nlooking back, i feel bad that we put the staff in a position where everything needed to be rushed but overall, our entire group was impressed with the food and service. thanks scarpetta for that!",

            "so after the rock n roll las vegas 1/2 marathon i decided it was time to carb up! wait, do you do that before you run? my beautiful girlfriend flew into town to join me and scarpetta was the perfect place to take her for dinner seeing we were staying at the cosmo and it wasn't too far of a walk for my trashed legs!  i had requested to be seated by the windows overlooking the bellagio fountains and the table couldn't have been more romantic. we requested the sommelier and he promptly came to our table and my gal and him found the perfect wine for us. i'm more of a vodka expert. for an appetizer we ordered some oysters, not sure where they were from, but they were smaller than normal yet very flavorful. my girlfriend and i split a couple entrees, the duck and <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark> and the colorado lamb trio. the duck and <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark> was amazing! i know it's not cool to do that to ducks, but i was bit by a duck when i was young and i'm cool with it. not too mention it was absolutely delicious! the colorado lamb trio was another memorable entree with what i believe was a lollipop, cutlet and steak. i must say this was a very romantic meal with excellent service and mouth watering food. scarpetta will always have a special place in our hearts! thanks"

            "handsome and i are celebrating our annual vegas trip this weekend and this review is a year overdue!! \n\nwe stayed at the cosmopolitan and we really wanted to eat at scarpetta. we love chopped and scott conant is one of our favorites. his restaurant is located on the third level of the cosmo. \n\nwe walked in and we had a reservation so we were seated promptly right by the window and we could see the bellagio fountain. it was so romantic. \n\nwe ordered wine (i don't remember which one) but it was amazing. for our starter we got the <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> and the duck and <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark>. both were spectacular. \n\nfor dinner handsome ordered the veal three ways and i ordered the <mark>Pan Roasted Halibut</mark>. handsome loved his veal and my halibut melted in my mouth.\n\nfor dessert we orders the rhubarb souffl\\u00e9 and i think that was handsome's favorite part. it was so light and fluffy with such a delicious flavor. \n\nour whole experience at scarpetta was amazing from start to finish. we will definitely be back."

            "scarpetta is at the newly opened cosmopolitan hotel in las vegas and we dropped by on a whim and are glad we did.  this turned out to be a sensational dining experience.  every single morsel of food that passed our lips was a taste sensation.  we started out with the seared sea scallops, the chestnut soup and the beet salad.  each was out of this world delicious!  our entrees consisted of the <mark>Black Cod</mark> which was buttery and perfect, the sicilian <mark>Spiced Duck Breast</mark> which was tender and tasty and the duck and <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark> which was creamy and sensational.  we ended our dinner with two desserts and i would highly recommend the <mark>Coconut Panna Cotta</mark> guava soup with carmelized pineapple.  double-yum!  service was outstanding and although we did not have have a table with a view overlooking the las vegas strip, we enjoyed our comfortable booth with room enough on the table for all the dishes we ordered. i would definitely want to return to this restaurant again and would highly recommend it to everyone.", 
            "so much potential here, the experience was really 3 star but i'm optimistic.\n\ngreat layout with large s-curved bank seating and a nice north facing view of the bellagio fountain. service is great but the kitchen timing needs work. food came out a bit slow and a bit cold which is normally a big time no-no but they are new and working out the kinks.\n\nfood is delicious, apps of short ribs and polenta truffles with mushrooms make for a great start. polenta was creamy and truffle accents were spot on. \n\npastas are house-made and cooked just al-dente. easy to do but somehow few places get it right. the spaghetti with creamy tomato and basil, just perfect, a great representation of italian food in its simplistic goodness. <mark>Black Cod</mark> done well, cooked nicely. \n\nduck and <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark> was a bit salty and cold and the agnolotti seemed too one dimensional. both were slightly warm and would have been better paired with a side. plates seemed a bit bare.\n\ndesserts-  very creative. napoleon-  deconstructed creme brulee with blood oranges, sweet and creamy, amazing combination. \n\nnutella warm molten chocolate bites with hazelnuts were also deliciously comforting. \n\noverall, given the lack of decent italian eateries with value on the strip, it's worth a visit. once they get the timing down, the kitchen and the service make this a sure-bet for a quality meal.", 
            "la pasta perfetto!\n\nsometimes the simplest things can be magical when executed perfectly.  this is the case with scarpetta, scott conant's debut into the las vegas restaurant scene.  \n\nthe decor is understated and classy, in shades of black, white and gray.  a knowledgable and unpretentious waitstaff makes the experience all that much better, as they walk you through the menu.  a few tables along the wall rest next to big windows which overlook the neon shimmer of the strip below.  if you're coming here with a small group, definitley request one of these tables.  \n\nadesso, il cibo  (now, the food)\n\n<mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> carpaccio -  four paper-thin slices of <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> treated with fine olive oil and a bit of garlic.  high quality fish and a gentle hand made this appetizer balanced and elegant.\n\nwaygu beef tartare - diced  waygu beef treated in a similar fashion to the <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark>, but with a more pronounced garlic note at the end.  very straightforward and satisfying.\n\nspaghetti marinara - as many have said, this is the best spaghetti you will ever eat.  the housemade al dente spaghetti is toothsome and tender.  somehow, the chefs here are able to pull the purest essence of tomato and basil out in this dish.  the simultaneous subtley and complexity of the flavor profile here is truly incredible.  i've spent a lot of time in italy, and honestly cannot think of a spaghetti that holds a candle to this masterpiece.  a must order!\n\nblack mac n' lobster - i believe the <mark>Black Cod</mark> of the noodles comes from squid ink, but i could be mistaken.  very nice flavors of lobster and the sea.  the texture was quite similar to the spaghetti, which i found to be redundant, but that was an error in my ordering, and nothing to do with the execution of the dish.  \n\nduck and <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark> w/ marsala reduction - the food that kings eat!  the ravioli was immaculate, formed with care and the love you'd expect from a homemade italian meal.  i found the combination of duck, foie gras, and the marsala reduction to be a bit too heavy.  i could see people raving about this dish, but for me it was just too much of a good thing.\n\nbranzino - gentle white fish with a lightly crisped skin and honest flavors.  one of the best cooked fish plates i can remember having.\n\ndry aged filet - the pink/gray color of this steak is visually contradictory to what you might find at a fine steak house, but that is due to the dry aging process.  it was tender, flavorful, and neat.\n\n\nyes the bread is incredible as well, but let's not fill up on bread.  scarpetta is a great date spot if you're looking to splurge.  do not leave without ordering the spaghetti, its the type of dish you'll tell your grandkids about.", 
            "ate there in march for a birthday celebration and was not disappointed.  this place is great and highly recommended.\n\nthe ambience is great. you do walk through a rather long narrow bar area, but when you get to the main dining area, you will be impressed. great views of the strip.  we were seated in a very private booth with floor to ceiling \"booth\" - it was intimate and allowed the 6 of us to really talk.  \n\nthe service - attentive.  not overbearing, not pushing (i..e we weren't that hungry and didn't order apps).  the breadbasket - yummy!!!!! \n\nseveral tried the <mark>Black Cod</mark> - delicous!! i had the duck - it was wonderful and cooked just right.  portions are on the smaller side, so if you are hungry make certain you order an appetizer.  the entrees were mostly in the $30 range, though some a bit cheaper.\n\nthey brought a lovely molten chocolate lava cake thing for the birthday boy, which was really tasty.\n\nthe wine list is huge! not cheap, but some good selections.\n\noverall - certainly a place i would return.", 
            "i been to the scarpetta in beverly hills, was a bit disappointed in the food there but decided to give this one a try.\n\ngood choice! i loved the venue, on the 3rd floor of the cosmo, mid dark light very elegant, though it is a bit more crowded due to the small space, but the bar area is very cute.\n\nwe got 4 diff appetizers, beet salad, pork belly, scallops and beef i liked them all\n\nthen 4 entrees: <mark>Black Cod</mark>, <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark>, diff meats ravioli and i forgot the last one! but again it was delicious, the <mark>Black Cod</mark> melts in your mouth!\n\ndifferent we got an apple pie sort with ice cream and raspberries.\n\ndef coming out here again next time  invegas. cosmo is just beautiful and elegant hotel very modern, but trying stk next time", 
            "we had great seating next to the windows viewing the bellagio fountains as requested.\nthe food was much better presented and tasteful than other italian restaurants i've visited in lv.\n\nthe bread basket is delightful with the trio of accompaniments: marscapone butter, eggplant in tomato ragu and citrus infused oil.  for appetizer we had the <mark>Creamy Polenta</mark>. enough for one or two to share as it is extremely rich as a separate duo of perfectly creamed polenta and truffled mushrooms. if you haven't already gobbled up your breads, make useful tool to sweep up the last juices.\nthree of us got the <mark>Black Cod</mark> which is superbly moist and light with a crisp skin, but the vegetables (fennel/peppers) were a bit too sour to match with.  and the other three got the <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark> which was rich and poignant with flavor but not unpleasant. the balsamic glaze was apparent and not overwhelming. i would have finished the entire plate.  \n\nwhy the three stars? lack of consistent service :(\ni don't include the guy who kept our water glasses filled. but we were all (party of 6) sourly disappointed with the main waiter. he only presented himself to take our order and serve the appetizer.  didn't even refilled our breads as asked.  then with empty plates, we all sat there for 15 minutes watching our server chummy up with a table of 3 girls and another table drinking it up with ample wine bottles. an assistant manager in a suit, bless him, came over, asked how our dinner was, saw our plates and decided to clear our table himself and also bring us our check.\nalthough we weren't completely dissatisfied with the whole dining experience, it's just unsettling when the server is mia with you and present elsewhere. \nso, maybe next time. if there is a next time.", 
            "leftovers for lunch yesterday, basically pasta all mashed together in a tupperware bowl, nuked into a hot mess. didn't have a fork, but ended up using 2 plastic knives as chopsticks to eat at my desk in front of my computer while i worked. first bite i had,  first thought was, \"omg!!! this is the worse pasta i have ever eaten in my life!  i can't believe i'm eating this!\"  then i proceeded to eat half of it, constantly thinking, \"why am i eating this!!?!?!\" before i finally throw the rest of the contents away in disgust.  why write about this experience?  because throughout that experience, i kept thinking of the best pasta i had ever eaten which was the spaghetti at scarpetta.  the texture, consistency, taste, and bite of the pasta was amazing!  the sauce was awesome, had a little bit of a kick to it.  i have to admit i have had better sauce, just barely, but that's because i really like a lot of garlic in my sauce, but the combination of the sauce and the spaghetti was incredible.  the rest of the meal was very good, the tomatoes & burrata dish, short ribs, polenta with truffles and assorted mushrooms, <mark>Black Cod</mark> with roasted tomatoes and fennel, <mark>Coconut Panna Cotta</mark>, and cr\\u00e8me brule were all excellent, but that pasta kicked this restaurant up another notch.  if you make reservations, ask for a window seat since we had an amazing view of the water show at the venetian.", 
            "unreal spaghetti. i know, it's spaghetti you say. easy enough. it's amazing. saw it on the techniques episode of no reservations, tried it, then had to punch myself for not trying it sooner in ny. everything else was great too. <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> and <mark>Crispy Fritto Misto</mark> to start, spaghetti and <mark>Black Cod</mark> to finish. highlight was the spaghetti though.", 
            "as guest we felt like a burden instead of welcomed and we found the foods  we tried as one dimensional and under seasoned , flat and the dessert awful . maybe they just weren't in the working flow of things yet or maybe it just was an off night i don't know.\n\nthe door was wide open at 5:25 so we walked in and the hostess told us to make a reservation for 5:30 and to leave and come back in a few minutes . we thought that seemed odd but thought it was just because she was very young and figured that was all it was and came back a few minutes latter .\n\ntoo start with i received a white lint filled napkin on top of my black pants , but i did notice they have black linen napkins they use for the wine bottles. \n\nwe felt uncomfortable the whole time dining because most of the time i saw up to eleven members of staff were standing across from us with their backs against the wall just looking out into our direction . i glared at them a few times but they didn't budge .\n\nwe started with the <mark>Tuna susci</mark> -described as marinated vegetables with preserved truffles , everything was <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> everything had little taste.\n\nwe shared the <mark>Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti</mark> , that were like mini raviolis filled with short rib that had a baby food texture inside the well made pasta. maybe ten percent of the  agnolottis we topped with a scant amount of toasted  crumbs slightly laced with horseradish for flavor that were resting in some browned butter.\n\nthe <mark>Black Cod</mark> although cooked nicely would have been forgettable but was not , only because of the concentrated tomato that i found interesting .  this dish was extremely mild and under seasoned with a few pieces of fennel that were nicely caramelized .\n\nmy husband had the <mark>Spiced Duck Breast</mark> and he said it was his least favorite one he ever had since the skin wasn't crispy and also lacked flavor , he thought it wasn't seasoned at all .\n\nwe had a little time to kill before the show so we thought maybe dessert might be good . we ordered the zeppole i don't mean to be mean or disrespectful but honest to god they tasted just like the chocolate muffins of the sweet tomatoes salad bar buffet , the zeppole were bread like , not sweet , almost not chocolate flavored and only a few zeppole not all had essence of nutella in them . \n\nat this price range they don't have this much room for error.", 
            "for years, i've always felt that -- among the casinos -- the mgm grand has the best restaurants.  this may be changing, and scarpetta is *certainly* one of the biggest reasons why.  \n\nlynn and i followed up our \"good\" dinner wednesday night at comme \\u00c7a (also <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark>) with dinner at scarpetta the next night (followed friday night by los, but that's been written up way to many times).  \n\nbeing a celebrity chef is a double-edged sword . . . it certainly gets your name out there, but then you (typically) aren't there to defend it -- someone else is in the kitchen is, but if it sucks, you get the blame.  a potentially dicey proposition at best.\n\nscott conant need not worry; his vegas outpost is in excellent hands.\n\nthe six of us began with a bottle of n.v. champagne from chartogne-taillet (cuv\\u00e9e ste.-anne), and ordered a round of appetizers \"for the table.\"  (the table, too, apparently was hungry -- not just the six of us!)  \n\nfinishing the champagne just as the appetizers arrived, we moved into a 2008 bruno giacosa arneis.  we enjoyed the <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> crudo, the <mark>Creamy Polenta</mark> with a fricassee of truffled mushrooms (the winner of this round, imho), and the roasted sea scallops with porcini and sunchokes . . . all were delightful!\n\nvegetarian alert:  this place is *very* cool, and vegetarian-friendly.  they have a totally separate vegetarian and vegan menu available for the asking (as one in our party did).\n\nmoving into the pasta course, we had the spaghetti with tomato and basil (so simple to say, so profound to eat -- nothing can describe the layers of flavor that you get here; magnificent!), the duck & <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark> with marsala reduction (ok, this is to die for!), and the <mark>Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti</mark> with with brown butter horseradish.  of course, we also moved into a stunning piedmontese red, the 1999 barbaesco riserva vigneti in ovello from the  produttori del barbaresco.  just gorgeous!\n\nour entr\\u00e9es included <mark>Black Cod</mark> with caramelized fennel & concentrated tomato, sirloin with potato gnocchi, wild mushrooms, parmigiano & barolo ragu, a veal chop the size of baltimore (and much more tasty), and the aforementioned spaghetti with tomato and basil (as an entr\\u00e9e portion).  \n\na little dessert, a little porto and coffee, and the world is a perfect place!\n\np.s. in case you haven't figured it out yet, their wine list is not only incredible, but there are some true gems on this list that remain real bargains (if you know how/where to look).", 
            "like other reviewers, i'm not a big fan of scott conant, a judge on the tv food show chopped. not sure if that's his real life persona or his made for tv simon cowell-like persona that makes for good ratings. i broke down and went to scarpetta, totally prepared to hate the place. as much as i wanted to hate it, i loved it. it's always interesting to read the reviews and see the swings, with one reviewer hating it and the next loving it. it's usually the total experience that somehow helps make the food more or less memorable. it was totally memorable for me, from being with my wife to the bellagio fountains to attentive service to the food being timely served, perfectly prepared and beautifully presented. the bread basket was all artisan selections, a meal in itself. the <mark>Creamy Polenta</mark> and truffled mushrooms were heavenly. the spaghetti was as good as spaghetti gets....there's only so much you can do with it and i thought the sauce was outstanding. the <mark>Black Cod</mark> melted in your mouth and was a work of art. the <mark>Coconut Panna Cotta</mark> was the most interesting, striking and palate pleasing dessert i've ever had.", 
            "a-ok is what scarpetta was. i was very excited to finally taste the famous pasta from the man himself-scott conant. i have been watching chopped for weeks and was curious what exactly does he think amazing pasta is. well scott maybe pasta is the only thing you should stick to.\n\nwe have ordered the hamachi, tuna, polenta, <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark>, <mark>Black Cod</mark> and the tasting menu.\n\nlet's start from the beginning. first of all i would like to say that the service was beyond reparable. we sat at the restaurant for almost 3 hours. it took the server to give us the menu for about half an hour and every time we looked for him he wasn't there. after hinting and hinting that we would like our food right away the longer it took to the point where we just left.\n\nhere is the breakdown:\n\nhamachi: nothing special-nobu beats this dish any day of the week.\n\n<mark>Tuna susci</mark>: if you think wrapping tuna over a bunch of carrots is creative-think again.\n\npolenta: i really enjoyed this dish. it came in a small pot with a mushroom sauce on the side. this was one of my favorite appetizers.\n\n<mark>Black Cod</mark>: it was a-ok. i wish it had more flavor and was more moist. i guess beggars can't be choosers. \n\nduck and <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark>: the dough was chewy and hard. the sauce on top ruined the whole dish in my opinion. the inside was tender and rich. i think if the ravioli were smaller and more tender it would come together better.\n\ntasting menu:\n\n<mark>Crispy Fritto Misto</mark>: a-ok. i like anchovies but i don't think this dish brought anything special to the table.\n\nspaghetti with tomato and basil was the best dish of the night! it was tender, flavorful and tasty. i would have this again any day!\n\ndessert: the <mark>Chocolate Cake</mark> was dry and even with the gelato on the side it still left a bitter rough flavor in my mouth!\n\nwe tried a few other things which i don't even care to discuss on the tasting menu\n\nthe bread basket was also pretty amazing! it came with 3 sauces which we ordered a second round of!\n\noverall i am not impressed by this italian restaurant. this has nothing to do with price or the atmosphere. i think as a food critic what you look at is the freshness of the food and the service. i have seen a lot of bad service but ignoring your patrons will not bring you very far.\n\nso scott conant i am giving you a c+. you have been chopped!", 
            "the final meal of our vegas escapade was well spent at scarpetta. it wasn't completely perfect but most of the night made up for the little missteps (we'll get to that later) so for the most part, i had nothing but a good time. attentive service, rich indulgent food, all housed within an intimate space with gorgeous views of the ballagio fountains, we closed our trip in pure hedonistic style.\n\nwe started with some of their signature cocktails as we browsed the menu. upon the recommendation from our fantastic server, and the joys of libation, we decided on the tasting menu ($99) and accompanying wine pairing ($49) since several of the dishes that we wanted to try were on it anyway and boy did we pick right. that was the beginning of six courses of pure pleasure.\n\nwe started with a sashimi plate (http://www.<mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark>.com/biz_photos/0nmtwqyeqikerdv4a55obg?select=yvhgcff5cqsiopyc83uwwa) which consisted of <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> with a drizzle of ginger oil and red onions. the other half of the plate sat the <mark>Tuna susci</mark> - tuna wrapped marinated vegetables. the fish was so fresh and the flavors were delicately balanced. the bread basket came shortly after and there was a nice selection including yummy foccacia and stromboli. as part of the tasting menu, the chef also threw in a couple of surprises and we were treated to a delightful seafood <mark>Crispy Fritto Misto</mark> for this course. perfectly crispy fried but not oily, every bite was yummy and the rock shrimp just melted in my mouth.  \n\nthe next course was a perfectly roasted sea scallop. (http://www.<mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark>.com/biz_photos/0nmtwqyeqikerdv4a55obg?select=06qyvnxbie8hftnykn4obw) it was a joy to eat and the velvety salmoriglio sauce was a nice accompaniment to the sweet and juicy scallop. the chef's extra this course was a polenta with a truffle mushroom stew. (http://www.<mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark>.com/biz_photos/0nmtwqyeqikerdv4a55obg?select=gtrwgpr4xgghmw0rvryanw) for the record i hate cornmeal and thus hate grits, tamales, and polenta. yet, i could not stop eating this polenta. the flavors of the mushroom stew combine with the impeccably smooth polenta. (i suspect there's a whole lot more butter in it than what chef scott conant lets on) it was a nice double headliner with the scallop. \n\nnext up was the pasta course and chef conant's signature tomato & basil spaghetti. (http://www.<mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark>.com/biz_photos/0nmtwqyeqikerdv4a55obg?select=jqrljq4g8bgizxs0bc8bow) fresh made pasta in a simple tomato basil (+ quarter stick of butter) sauce but just perfectly executed. while i thoroughly enjoyed it, the chef's extra this course, the <mark>Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti</mark> with brown butter horseradish & toasted breadcrumb (http://www.<mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark>.com/biz_photos/0nmtwqyeqikerdv4a55obg?select=wzfcolektvylois628h_ag), totally blew my mind. wow who would have thought that the combination of short ribs, horseradish, and toasted breadcrumbs could be so sublime? i miss it already as i speak. \n\nthe next course was the <mark>Black Cod</mark>. (http://www.<mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark>.com/biz_photos/0nmtwqyeqikerdv4a55obg?select=2tmoceavt5t4aeu8j6itra) again perfectly seared but wonderfully moist in the middle. the fatty fish absolutely stands out against the sauce and caramelized fennel. delicious. the next entree course was a the <mark>Spiced Duck Breast</mark>. (http://www.<mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark>.com/biz_photos/0nmtwqyeqikerdv4a55obg?select=br1frh72uravjtrhiq6w-a) while this was my least favorite dish of the night, it was still absolutely delicious which tells you the quality of the food all night. the orange and spices (i kept picking up 5 spice) worked well with gamy duck. all in all, a successful combination. \n\nfinal course and dessert was a <mark>Chocolate Cake</mark> with toasted almond gelato and caramel. (http://www.<mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark>.com/biz_photos/0nmtwqyeqikerdv4a55obg?select=udi5apzqgqwuqcgjvukosg) this is where i really had to throw in the towel after all that eating. the <mark>Chocolate Cake</mark> was really rich and decadent and i could only finish half of it but i just couldn't let the toasted almond gelato go to waste. it was just delicious. you can totally taste the toasted flavor. \n\nnow on to the kink of the night. since we were seated by the wine cellar, the sommelier came by several times to retrieve bottles of wine. each single time, he let the door hit me as i was eating without even acknowledging it, much less apologize. not that it was a deal breaker but you expect a little more basic courtesy especially when you're dropping good money on dinner. \n\nstill for a wonderfully decadent meal paired with friendly and attentive service, we had a good time and i strongly recommend scarpetta if you want to treat yourself to a fine meal on the strip.", 
            "the bread basket alone would bring me back! that stromboli is amazing! i love salami and bread, so put the two together.....fuggetaboutit!\n\nwe had the tasting menu: \n\n- duo of <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> and tuna \"susci\": melt in your mouth delicious!\n\n- roasted sea scallops, cauliflower, bottarga, chili and caper salmoriglio: sea scallops can be rubbery and chewy if not cooked properly, but at scarpetta, they were cooked to perfection. they had the consistency of flaky, firm fish and the roasted cauliflower was a perfect pairing.\n\n- spagetti tomato basil - simple and good, but not memorable.\n\n- <mark>Black Cod</mark>, caramelized fennel & concentrated tomatoes - the fish was nice and flakey and the tomatoes added a nice acidity to the fish. i'm not a fan of fennel as they are too \"licorice-y\" in flavor for my taste.\n\n- <mark>Spiced Duck Breast</mark>, endive, preserved orange and cippollini - delicious! i love duck, but i hate when its not cooked properly or tastes overly fatty. this was a perfect balance. the preserved orange cut through the richness of the duck. yum!\n\n- amedei <mark>Chocolate Cake</mark> & toasted almond gelato - toasted almond gelato & salted caramel sauce. self explanatory....it was heaven!\n\nwhat made this experience special was that the chef brought out a few mini appetizers with every dish served, so it was like having an \"extended\" tasting menu. he brought out:\n\n- <mark>Crispy Fritto Misto</mark> - seafood, vegetables, artichokes, herbs & lemon\n- <mark>Creamy Polenta</mark> - fricassee of truffled mushrooms: by far my favorite dish at scarpetta. upon first glance, it looks like it would be too heavy and rich, but it was amazing!\n- <mark>Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti</mark> - brown butter horseradish & toasted breadcrumb.\n- zeppole - nutella center, vanilla sauce and candied hazelnuts. need i say more?\n\ni loved the ambiance and service of this restaurant. we were seated by the window facing the fountains of bellagio. a beautiful place to take someone on a date!", 
            "owner scott conant (the dude from chopped) hates <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark>. therefore, i don't trust him... half kidding\n\ni think scarpetta is more like 4 stars, but i knocked off a star because our party definitely felt a little sick after eating here. maybe it was an off day (we think it's from the cheese in the potatoes of a side dish).\n\nundeniably a beautiful spot to eat. the large windows display the neighboring bellagio water fountain show, where my girlfriends and i packed into one side of the booth, so we could watch and eat at the same time.\n\noysters west coast - good, fresh <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark>. i loved the horseradish sauce that came with it, and a gravy boat of tabasco was brought to us upon request\n\nstracci - a flat noodle pasta with lobster, crab, shrimp. there were generous portions of seafood and the pasta and tasted creamy/good.\n\nduck & <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark> - i actually have to go against the hype to say that it was just okay, and not that great. the dish was a tad bit colder than luke warm, and just the richness of the foie gras/drier duck made it hard to finish the whole dish. maybe a couple bites and i was pretty much done with it :-p\n\n<mark>Black Cod</mark> - so soft and melted in my mouth (i think i ate a cloud..). \n\nribeye <mark>Braised Short Ribs of Beef</mark> 24 oz - for $62, this had better been some good ribeye. although i know that scarpetta doesn't specialize in steak, i thought it was a bit overpriced for it being standard and nothing special.  even though it was medium-rare, the steak was still a tad tough.\n\n**don't fill up on the bread** scarpetta has fantastic bread. the bread basket had 3-4 different kinds of breads, one of them being a melted roll of salami and cheese (a meal itself). and the bread came with mascarpone butter (love), eggplant dip, and olive oil\n\none of the better restaurants in the cosmo. did anybody realize the restaurants in the city center area (cosmopolitan, vdara, aria) are not that great? hmmm", 
            "the bf and i had trouble deciding where to go for our anniversary and he had put me to the task of finding a place with a scallop appetizer and a solid light white fish entree and scarpetta won out in our short lists of places that fit the bill. \n\ni love the 50's low lights and bold dark wood grain used in the restaurant. we were seated by the windows to witness a rainy and moody sky (which i happen to like). people said this is a nice view...but there is a large partition on the windows and it happens to be at eye level.  i cant see the water, only the top of the spray of the bellagio show. it defeated the purpose a little bit....\n\nstarters\n\nwe started off with the raved about bread basket. there was a stromboli in there rolled with cheeses and salami that was delicious. if i could order that at the lounge i would. there was also sourdough slice, a bread roll, 2 herbed foccacia squares. they give a trio of butter, a eggplant caponata and citrus infused oil. caponata was lovely and all the bread was warm, soft and nicely crusty.\n\nroasted sea scallops- which they split onto two presentations for each of us to have one. it was a very fresh scallop, nicely seared. there was a light spice that came through as you chewed it, capers and bottarga on top gave some briny flavor, micro green some bitterness and salmoriglio made for a nice creamy sauce to it. it was served on top of a steak of cauliflower that was nicely roasted. \n\nduck and <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark> with marsala reduction - was one i was very curious about since many rave about this and the spaghetti. i've had the spaghetti before in la (and did not weep) and now that i actually know the scarpetta recipe and have replicated it, i wanted to know if something else was rave worthy. this was tasty, but it was just a bit too rich for such a big plate of it.  some may love a whole heap, but i'm glad it was split as a appetizer...and still there was too many for us. we're freegetarians ( semi vegetarians) and don't really have many rich foods since switching over to the dark side..\n\nentree\n\nmediterranean branzino - came with 2 nice sized filets with nicely crisp skin and beautifully flaky meat. if came with a bed of braised leeks, celery root, shrimps, clams and mussels and had a seafood broth reduction as a sauce so it was very clean, sea flavors going on here.\n\n<mark>Black Cod</mark> - fish was nice and buttery, with a herbaceous,somewhat anise tasting, tomato glaze and micro chives. it had caramelized fennel & roasted tomato to go with. i've always had <mark>Black Cod</mark> aka butterfish in a asian preparation so this was interesting to try something different. \n\nthe bf preferred the branzino and so did i.\n\ndessert \n\nzeppole - with nutella center, vanilla sauce & candied hazelnuts was divine. these were rich pillows of heaven. i love zeppoles and beignets of all kinds and this is among the best i've had. will come back. just for these. \n\nbrown butter hazelnut cake - the name makes it sound like it would be more brown buttery cakey thing, but it truly was more about the lemon curd, meringue. i'm slowly growing to like lemon desserts and this was good enough to make me believe in it. it had olive oil gelato & candied hazelnuts to go which gave a light savory aspect to it. this was a great choice to balance out the zeppole since those were just dense and this was bright. \n\nservice was decent. there was a mixup with the kitchen and our appetizers went to the wrong table at first, back to the kitchen and eventually to us. service cleared plates and refilled drinks quite frequently and checked on us. a little weird note but in the area we were seated the chef was coming around and talking to tables and even serving one of the tables around us. i guess good that there are regulars but found little awkward as well. \n\nit was a solid choice for dinner and went home happy. i see they have a vegetarian menu and have a nice lounge area so i would consider coming back for a snack there and those zeppoles...i don't know if i would do a \"all out\" dinner here again though.\n\nthe night after our dinner here we went to a establishment off strip and the flavor and quality was on par with better prices, vibe and surpasses in service. \n\noverall, scott conants place is solid for the strip and i'm glad it is here, but it was surprisingly not the star of our weekend.", 
            "we decided to try a new restaurant in las vegas and i'm glad i did. this place has it all..the food, service, view and add a good bottle of wine with great company now that's the way to live. \n\ni ordered the west coast oysters which are fresh and so delicious and the <mark>Black Cod</mark> which is done to perfection. my friend had the spaghetti in which i tried and it was amazing. i'm not a spaghetti fan so that tells you a lot. i also noticed that they have gluten free options on the menu that is rare in las vegas restaurants. i will definitely go back if the budget allows it.", 
            "happy b-day to me!!!\n\nokay we decide to do vegas for my bday and i've been wanting to try out this place.  my good work friend of mine recommended it...shout out to frank m. for the recommendation.\n\nso i completely forget it's in vegas cause i'm a guy and have the attention span of a 2 year old.  but the wifey thinks of everything and yes i know i'm lucky and yes i tell her frequently.\n\nwe ordered:\nbread basket - wow!  great start!  \n\n<mark>Creamy Polenta</mark> - magical buttery love potion.  add to anything to make it better.  you can put this on cardboard and enjoy.\n\nroasted sea scallops - cooked to utter perfection.  texture was great.  had a hint of fish to it but i loved it.\n\nduck and <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark> - although i have an extreme love of foie gras, this dish was just okay for me.  the texture and temperature of the ravioli didn't mesh well with the foie and it just clashed.  i had high hopes for this one.\n\nspaghetti - this was supposed to be my highlight.  i even went online and made this dish based on raves i've heard about it.  i have to say i wasn't impressed.  the spaghetti noodles were too thick and didn't have that homemade taste or texture to it.  it was served too cold for my taste as well.  maybe the size of our group affected my experience here.  very sad moment when it hit my palette.  i probably should have asked them to redo it but the vodka had already soaked in and my enthusiasm was curbed.\n\n<mark>Black Cod</mark> - just a fish on a dish.  flavors were okay but this didn't do much for me at all.\n\nmy worst fears had materialized.  the moment when you start so fast in the direction of brilliance just to be let down along the way.  i wouldn't say it was a complete let down as the dishes were all pretty well put together, however, that's all it was.  great shit thrown on a plate...i didn't feel inspired...i wasn't brought anywhere...i was just at a restaurant in vegas eating with my hot wife and a group of great friends.  it would have made the night perfection if the experience matched the bill.\n\n*thanks wifey for the extremely thought-filled dinner plan - you're loved*", 
            "i was very very excited to come here while on a girls weekend to vegas. both my friend and i thought this would be one of our highlights!\n\nunfortunately, it didn't live up to the hype in our visit. my friend has a few food allergies. their gluten-free menu was a great help, but we had asked for her to be contacted by the restaurant beforehand to verify that she would be able to eat there. she didn't need anything crazy, just a confirmation that very simple things could be accommodated. things that have been easily done by red robin and other chains. easy stuff. they called her an hour before our reservation and spoke for about 30 minutes.she was assured that the waiter would be notified of her needs and that her requests could easily be honored. great!\n\nwe get there and are seated right away (despite being a little late due to traffic) but our waiter knew nothing about the conversation that had taken place just 30 minutes before. he went to talk to the hostess and everyone played dumb all around. despite her requests being quite simple and her efforts to be an easy customer, we were made to feel like a great big hassle to everyone. \n\nwe split the <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> app and they messed up hers but quickly fixed it. it was so delicious though incredibly tiny even if we hadn't split the portion! there was a long delay for our entrees and the chef sent out a free salad during the wait. they also messed that up but fixed it. my friend had the <mark>Black Cod</mark> and i had the short rib angolotti. the cod was again a very small portion. the angolotti was a generous portion, especially given the richness. it was very good but we felt it overpriced for portion and quality, even for vegas.\n\ni had asked for my remaining angolotti (about 2/3 of my serving, so a large amount) to be boxed up to take with me and not 5 seconds after the waiter had acknowledged my request, he stacked a bunch of plates on top of my plate and walked off, thus ruining my leftovers. i watched him to make sure he wouldn't unstack the plates and scrape off my food into a box. luckily he did not. my annoyance was high and we had a show to attend so i decided to not make a fuss and just let it go.\n\nmy friend and i have eaten out many times at many different types of places with a variety of price points. this was the worst in terms of service at this type of restaurant. the food was ok. maybe it was an off night, who knows. i wouldn't waste my time or money here again when we come back to vegas.", 
            "prime location, delicious food, and great service...our meal at scarpetta was definitely one of the highlights of our vegas trip. there were a few missteps on our food adventure, but not nearly discouraging enough to detract from the overall experience. \n\nwe made reservations for 6:30 on thursday night, which seemed to be the latest time to arrive and get one of the tables overlooking the bellagio fountains. we got the last one available. the only issue with the view is that there is a giant metal bar running exactly eye level across the window, so you have to pop your head up like a little meercat just to get a glimpse of the fountains. oh well.\n\nwe ordered the tasting menu and told the waiter that we'd like a bottle of white wine, somewhere in the semi-sweet to semi dry range, full-to-medium bodied, in the $50-60 range. the waiter brought us two options to taste, and we went with a delicious riesling. the bread course came with a lovely tray of marscapone cheese whipped butter, lemon infused olive oil, and a delicious fresh tomato spread. we didn't eat too much, because we knew we had seven courses of awesome heading our way:\n\n1) the first course was <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> and tuna sushi. the <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> was served with thin pink rock salt wafers that complemented the fish perfectly. the tuna was rolled around marinated vegetables and served with preserved mushrooms. everything was light, fresh, and flavorful. an excellent way to start a meal. a <mark>Crispy Fritto Misto</mark> came on the side - the tempura fried herbs and lemon were a delicious addition to the standard tempura fare - shrimp...veggies...etc.\n\n2) the second course was a sea scallop served on top of cauliflower, with a cauliflower puree, chili oil, and a salad with capers on top. - the capers were a bit salty for my liking, so i pulled them off, and the cauliflower with the cauliflower puree was a little redundant, but oh. my. goodness. that scallop was the best i've ever had. the crust was perfectly carmelized, and the scallop inside was tender and melted in your mouth. the small trace of heat from the chili oil added an unexpected twist to the dish and really took it to another level. \n\n3) the chef added in course number three - <mark>Creamy Polenta</mark> with truffled mushrooms. my biggest complaint here is that i can never eat anyone else's polenta again. amazing doesn't even begin to describe it. my friend and i dove into this lake of creamy, buttery, savory goodness with reckless abandon, knowing full well that we were completely spoiling our appetite for the four remaining courses. if nobody had been watching, i would have licked the bowl. we took a little break before moving on in the meal.\n\n4) the pasta course was both a super high and super low note in the meal. after seeing scott conant revered as the king of spaghetti on television time after time, we finally got to see what all the fuss was about. the simple spaghetti dish was amazing. i have never had pasta so perfectly al dente. there was a bite to it that other pastas lack, almost to the point where you feel like it will stick in your teeth, but it doesn't. it was served with a fresh tomato basil sauce that was so perfect, it didn't need any fancy infused oils or architechtural garnishes. it was just pasta perfection. \nhowever, the short ribs angnolotti with brown butter horseradish sauce was just awful. the horseradish sauce blew away every other flavor on the plate, and it wound up tasting like a big plate of mustard. this is the awkward thing about not liking a dish in a tasting course - we were only halfway through the meal and we'd had such good courses previously, that we felt a little awkward sending it back...so we just moved forward with the meal.\n\n5) the next course was a <mark>Black Cod</mark> with concentrated tomato sauce and carmelized fennel. perfect crispy skin, rich, flavorful sauce, and crunchy fresh veggies - definitely a hit.\n\n6) <mark>Spiced Duck Breast</mark> with endive, cippolini onions, and a preserved orange - this dish was ingenious. the duck, endive, and onion were perfectly cooked, but it was the addition of the super thin slice of sweet preserved orange that really made the dish. \n\n7) dessert - simply outstanding - a chocolate lava cake on a streak of carmel sauce with toasted almond gelato on a bed of chocolate cookie crumbs, with a delicate twirl of chocolate as a garnish. \n\nthe only problem with this meal is that it was so delicious, there was no way you could leave anything on your plate. my friend and i polished off every dish - which left us feeling so full that we barely made it out of the restaurant.\n\nif you decide to attempt this delicious seven course food adventure - open your wallets wide - food, drinks, and tip set us back $350...but it was well worth it.", 
            "a-m-a-z-i-n-g!!!  \n\nloved scarpetta in beverly hills, so when i found out they had opened a scarpetta in vegas, naturally i had to go!!  the restaurant is located in the tres chic cosmopolitan hotel.  we were seated by the window overlooking the bellagio fountains!  so beautiful!  our server - so attentive, nice, and i mentioned i would be going to dc the following week and he came back with a list of things i should check out in dc!  talk about service! \n\nand then the food!!!  seriously, soooooooooo good! of course, their spaghetti is out of this world!  first saw it on the food network best thing i ever ate... so tried it in la.  sounds like the most basic dish but seriously, you have to try it!   if you've been to italy and know what al dente pasta is... this is the closest you'll get to it.  this time, i had the <mark>Black Cod</mark> - i'm going to say i probably wouldn't order that again - but it was still good!  i think stick with the pastas!  their bread  basket is pretty awesome too!\n\nso i gave 4-stars for my review of the beverly hills scarpetta, mostly because the ambiance of the restaurant was just eh... but vegas did it right!!  so hip, trendy, and just a nice vibe!!  \n\nand for a restaurant of this caliber, the prices are not bad at all!!", 
            "we have eaten at scarpetta in vegas 2 times and once at the miami location.  after eating at the vegas location the first time, we were so impressed and loved the food so much we chose it for the location of our rehearsal dinner.   \n\nwe had our wedding rehearsal dinner for 32 people at scarpetta in the vino room on 6/15.  i'm so happy we did.  everything was absolute perfection.  i have to give a shout out to the staff at scarpetta especially kelly racine for all of her help.  she was fantastic throughout this process.   \n\nwe had a menu that consisted of the following\n\nbraised short ribs (very good)\ncreamy pollenta (to die for)\nheirloom tomato salad\n\nspaghetti (in no way over rated)\n<mark>Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti</mark> (spectacular in every way)\n\n<mark>Black Cod</mark> (did not have this for my entree, but it got good reviews)\nsirloin with gnocchi & wild mushrooms (delish!)\n\nwe also had two different desserts served to our table that were outstanding. \n\nthe waitstaff was fantastic, very polite and moved around the room seamlessly.   i can not wait to return for another meal.   and if you're looking for a place to have a small wedding reception or rehearsal dinner, i highly recommend adding scarpetta to your list of restaurants to check out.", 
            "i'd like to preface this review by saying i haven't had very many fine dining experiences. that being said, this is by far one of the best in terms of food quality and service. yes, it is indeed pricey, but that should be expected with any fine dining experience no matter where you are.\n\ni can only comment on the dishes i tried, so here they are:\n+ complimentary bread & spread - all of the bread was great. for our spread, we had olive oil, egg plant, and marscapone cheese. i've always preferred butter instead of olive oil, but this one was quite tasty. the olive oil had an almost herbal/spice taste to it. the egg plant is prepared with a tomato sauce or something, so it paired really well with the stromboli bread.\n+ roasted sea scallop appetizer - delicious, practically melts in your mouth. the portion is rather small as you only get two.\n+ duck and <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark> - very rich to the point where it was almost a struggle to finish the plate, but it was so scrumptious, i couldn't stop eating.\n+ spaghetti - probably one of the best i've ever had. pasta perfectly al dente with just tomato and basil, but the sauce had a creaminess to it that made it divine.\n+ <mark>Black Cod</mark> - another great dish, but overshadowed by all of the other fantastic plates. it was seasoned well. the accompanying cherry tomatoes tasted so bright. if i ever go to scarpetta again, though, i'd probably forego this dish and try something else.\n\nlastly, to expand on the service aspect, our waiter was very personable, cracking a few jokes throughout the night. he was helpful with making suggestions on the menu and explaining everything. our water glasses never really went low. oh, and the view of the bellagio fountain was gorgeous. only downside is the window divider thing was right at eye level, so we had to look above or below it to see. definitely a wonderful restaurant for a date night, though.", 
            "came here for a special occasion after nora's wine bar closed.  we needed something that would wow us.  the ambiance certainly did, the service was great, and the food certainly did at times.\n\nwe did the tasting menu.  and the bottom line is that we were very happy, but not as happy as we could possibly be.  the expectation was high, and so was the price...so at the price we really needed it to come through for a 5 star rating...it ended as a 4 or 4.5 star experience for us.\n\nthere were a few items that left us wanting.  the spaghetti was good, but not the best thing i ever ate good (pasta or tomato... either way it was just above average good.)    the spaghetti was simple and lacked anything to set it off as truly amazing--coming off above-average, but slightly flat.  likewise we enjoyed the duck & <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark>, but not at the raved about level we hoped for. the raviolis were overly rich and lacking balance...we were vary happy to just have a small portion in the tasting menu.\n\nsome of our favorites were <mark>Black Cod</mark>, branzino, <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark>, and <mark>Creamy Polenta</mark> with fricassee of truffled mushrooms.\n\nwe were also happy with the bread basket...how can you not be though?...a bread basket that includes a stromboli of rolled with cheeses and salami...yes please!\n\nwe had an amazing seat overlooking the bellagio fountains.", 
            "my sister asked me to find a good place to have pre-christmas dinner with our mom in las vegas and i actually found scarpetta by searching for top rated restaurants near the strip with foie gras. seriously. i need my foie gras.\n\nwith the recent foie gras ban in california keeping me from one of my favorite delicacies, i definitely wanted to have it if i was crossing state lines.  scarpetta stuck out to me because it wasn't a french restaurant, but an italian one, which is my mom's favorite... and a great way for everyone to be happy.\n\nscarpetta was perfect. situated in the new and beautiful cosmopolitan hotel, it has an amazing view of the bellagio and definitely has that upscale \"we are dining somewhere really fancy\" vibe.  the server was really enthusiastic about the dishes and described them each eloquently (i read one person's review that found this annoying, but i thought it was great!) and helped with recommendations for what to order.\n\nstarter:\n\npolenta with mushrooms. oh. my god. to die for. seriously.  wow.  best dish of the night and that's saying a lot because everything was great.\n\nmains:\n\nduck and <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark> - obviously what i ordered and obviously i loved it.  i was also pleasantly surprised by the portion size. usually when you order ravioli you get like, 4, and are left being hungry, but not in this case. it was a generous portion.  i would have loved there to be more foie gras but that's just being greedy.\n\nfennel spiced <mark>Black Cod</mark> - my mom ordered this and it was probably the least interesting thing that we had, but still delicious.\n\nblack tonarelli - my sister ordered this and it was also amazing, al dente, just as it should be.  it took about 10 minutes to come out after the rest of the dishes and they kept apologizing profusely for it and then sent out two free desserts to make up for it.\n\n(free!) desserts:\n\nmascarpone cheesecake - lighter than your average cheesecake, which made me like it more.\n\namaedi <mark>Chocolate Cake</mark> - like a lava cake, but better.. the perfect texture / consistency with hot melted chocolate inside... served with almond ice cream...\n\nthis was one of the best italian meals i've ever had outside of italy,  and i've tried all of those overrated high end italian restaurants in los angeles. i was expecting much less, thinking this was a bit of a tourist trap that i was buying into for the evening. it ended up being so much more. i was so pleasantly surprised and happy with the experience. also, no bs portion sizes.. these are hearty portions and you will leave full.\n\ndefinitely one of my top (if not the top) italian restaurants outside italy.  i just may need to go visit the scarpetta in la.", 
            "my friend had tried the scarpetta in la and had raved about it, so when she came to town we had to try the one at the cosmopolitan hotel. she was absolutely right (she usually is ;) and i have been back several times since first trying it with her. \n\nthe restaurant is beautifully done .. very contemporary and chic .. and most every seat boasts a fabulous view of the bellagio fountain show. it's a great place for entertaining out-of-town guests for sure. one time we even had the privilege of being seated at the \"chefs\" table (which is in a private room) with a prime view of the fountain show and the entire kitchen. \n\nthe food .. what can i say .. everything we've tried there is spectacular! my favorites are the <mark>Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti</mark>, which is simply melt-in-your mouth goodness and the tagliatelle with fall vegetables, truffle zabagalione & guanciale, which is just the right amount of truffle and is nice and light. i've also tried that famous spaghetti .. it's good, very good, but not something that i would order again. some of my dining partners have tried the lobster pasta, the <mark>Black Cod</mark> and the <mark>Spiced Duck Breast</mark> and the little bites i tried were good, but not necessarily items i would order. \n\nfrom the starters, my favorites are the <mark>Creamy Polenta</mark>, again with truffle :) and the <mark>Braised Short Ribs of Beef</mark>. the calamari and the scallops are also good, but we keep going back to the polenta. \n\ndessert .. the most important part of the meal .. the second time we were there, we saw something at another table that looked delicious and right up our alley .. turns out it was not on their menu but from the neighboring scott conant eatery docg enoteca. it's called the salted caramel budino with pretzel toffee.  it is super creamy and  the perfect balance of both sweet and salty at the same time. we shared it the first go-around but now order one each whenever we go .. and that rarely happens. \n\nthe service is impeccable, friendly knowledgeable servers and bussers who go the extra mile and have great personalities. the first time we were there my dining partner mentioned she was heading to dc the following weekend and our server came back with a list of fun things / places for her to do while she was there.",

            "easily one of the best meals we have had on the strip.  from start to finish, from the service to the food to the view, there was nothing anyone at our table could say negatively about scarpetta.\n\ni had the <mark>Black Cod</mark> which is apparently becoming very chic now.  it was so light and buttery that i only wish i could have had more.  it almost melts in your mouth.  \n\ngoing as a group was beneficial because we were able to try several of the pasta dishes and share.  i'm not sure the pastas are enough as an individual entree but probably too much for an individual appetizer...if that makes sense.  they are perfect for sharing.  we went with the short rip agnolotti, traditional spaghetti, and <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark>.  all were awesome, even the spaghetti which was a surprise to those at the table doubting a typical or plain type of pasta was worth a try.\n\ni would also highly recommend the lamb, at least 3 people at our table got it so i was lucky enough to have a bite or two.  it was perfectly cook on every plate and was so tender it was definitely a star of the menu.", 
            "simply put scarpetta is my favorite vegas restaurant. \ni've been a few times and each time i've left as satisfied as possible. \n\nfor an appetizer, i've had the squash soup, the <mark>Tuna susci</mark>, and braised short ribs. the squash soup is some of the best i've ever had. the tuna was good but i wouldn't get it again. the braised short ribs were perfect and while i have no idea what was in that sauce, it was heavenly. probably will get the braised short ribs the next few times i go.\n\nas for entrees, they are famous for their duck and <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark> and believe me, it lives up to the loftiest of expectations. it's such a unique dish and the duck and foie gras compliment each other perfectly. it doesn't feel too heavy, goes down sooooo smoothly and has this great sauce on top with just the perfect amount of cheese. ive had it multiple times and plan on getting it again in the future. \ni've also had the <mark>Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti</mark> which is almost as superb. the short rib is great and you get this really tasty hint of horseradish in the sauce. it's far from overwhelming, just a hint of it, but after a full plate of the agnolotti, you can certainly tell its there. but it doesn't take away from the dish, the short rib and pasta are both great.\nwhile i've not tried the <mark>Black Cod</mark> or the steak, my companions have and they have reported being very happy with their choices.\n\noddly enough, i've not had dessert at scarpetta. maybe in the future i will, i'm sure it will be tasty.\n\na few other things to note: the view is superb, definitely ask for a window seat and you'll get a side view of the bellagio fountains. it's just a matter of luck and if they have a table available, ask when you make the reservation. the portions are great. so often vegas portions (especially at nice restaurants) are so small, but these are adequate and leaves you filling full but not overly full (as often dishes are so heavy with fat and cream and such). the price is very appropriate. nothing is exorbitantly pricy, nothing is cheap, the price is correct.", 
            "skip the primi, dive into the secondi.  scarpetta excels at pasta.\n\nwhile it is true, a recent trip to italy has forever altered my perception of italian food (the reason for the loss of a star), scarpetta delivers with an italian chic d\\u00e9cor, light spirited service, contemporary plating, and italian cooking sensibility.\n\nstraight to the pastas.  plated as a secondi (second course before the main), portions are smaller.  do like the italians, save your bread to mop up the left over sauce once you finish the pasta.  trust me, do it, you'll understand.\n\nthe tagliatelle with a truffle zabaglione and guanciale, a take on carbonara is excellent.  all the flavor of carbonara are there, just lighter. the pasta is toothsome and near perfect.\n\nduck and <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark>.  thin sheets of translucent pasta around packets of duck and melting foie.  glazed with a sweet marsala and duck stock reduction.  the sauce is enriched with dribbles of foie fat as the little packets are broken open.\n\nfinally, the spaghetti with tomato and basil is a take on amatriciana.  simple, fresh pure of tomato, hint of fresh basil.  clean flavor.\n\nalthough i'm happy with two or three pastas, most think i've gone foodie crazy so if you must, the  mains.  the <mark>Spiced Duck Breast</mark> with endive, preserved orange, and cipollini onions is excellent.  perfectly rendered, the skin of the rare duck is crisp with no cloying underlying <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark>.  it's earthy, ducky flavor cut by the sauce of preserved orange and duck jus creates a very well balanced dish.  not to be outdone, the fennel spiced <mark>Black Cod</mark>.  hints of licorice taint the delicate flavor of the cod, the acidity of tomatoes and the briny, salty flavor of olives elevate it.  unfortunately, i couldn't find the mantecato of baccala the menu promised.  all good, the dish worked.\n\ngreat wine list.  heavy emphasis on italy.  \n\nis scarpetta truly italian?  no.  (you should still tip your server; i miss italy).  it does however, deliver a great experience.", 
            "delicious food, the view was beautiful, the fountains at the bellagio, classy ambience, good for couples, or group of friends, it is very nice, the food, starting with the bread omg it's soooo goood, we tried the pici pasta, <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark>, fennel spiced <mark>Black Cod</mark>, mediterranean orata and the prime ny steak... everything was sooo delicious, the service was perfect, the waiter was very nice... the price is standar for vegas for a nice restaurant... i want to go back... for sure!!", 
            "after reading all the great <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> reviews we picked this place for my wife's birthday. here is your ex-elite <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> renegade review.  i hope it is good enough for you.\n\nour waiter helped with the wine list and led us in the right direction.  huge win, you shouldn't have to study beforehand to be able to order wine.\n\nthe bread is in fact good. but remember when you review a restaurant that knowing the bread is good is not actionable info.  actually by knowing this i ordered a strong drink knowing the bread could save me, so good tip.\n\nthe appetizers we had were rich, interesting that all of them looked rich. polenta was good.  crab corn chowder was great because it came as a plate of just crab - where's the chowder? they pour it on right in front of you, that's where. fun and effective, lots of nice flavors all stood out. the appetizers were big.\n\nso then we tried the spaghetti because of the <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> reviews. it's tomato basil sauce on spaghetti. everyone who raves about it is questionable. have you ever had spaghetti with tomato basil sauce before? it is like that but over twenty dollars. ours was super salty which i didn't like. this dish would be chopped for sure.\n\nwe had two fish dishes both were pretty good but the fennel <mark>Black Cod</mark> was the best, cooked just through.\n\ndessert was 5 huge doughnut balls and really surprised me. simple and delicious. they were perfectly done. not a thing wrong. super satisfying. service had ramped back up for dessert.\n\nthe setting is sweet. windows overlooking the bellagio fountains. cool looking wine cellar. plan your visit to be there through sunset as the strip lights come on.  it had a comfortable relaxed atmosphere but still classy.  we had a lot of fun.  i'd go again.", 
            "we came here on a wednesday evening for a company meeting. our menu consisted of a full course meal: \nprimi - served family style\n1. <mark>Creamy Polenta</mark> - fricassee of truffled mushrooms\n2. heirloom tomato salad - burrata, marinated eggplant \npasta - served family style \n1. spaghetti - tomato and basil \npiatti - individual \n1. fennel dusted <mark>Black Cod</mark> - concentrated tomatoes, mantecato, black olive oil \n2. organic jidori chicken - mustard spatzle carrots, fegato sauce\ndolce - served family style\n1. amedei <mark>Chocolate Cake</mark> - toasted almond gelato, salted caramel sauce\n\n- hard to find! literally, it's like a crevice on the third floor of the cosmo! wtf, weird entrance. \n- nice staff. presentable dining area for larger groups. fast at wine refills. \n- i loved the spaghetti! although simple, the noodles tasted great! the flavoring was fresh and rich. \n- their polenta was unremarkable. cornmeal boiled in porridge. i prefer simple mashed potatoes. \n- fresh tomato salad! loved the ripe tomatoes. but awkward to eat as family-style. \n- the chicken was soft and tender. not too salty. i'm glad i got this over the cod. although the cod was flavored nicely, i didn't like picking some of the bones out of it. \n- dessert was amazing. not too sweet, but the correct balance to end of the meal.\n- overall, nice plating and nice night.", 
            "so while at a convention in vegas, my two co-workers and i came here for dinner on 10/6/13 on a recommendation from a friend who claimed it's the best restaurant in the city. all three of us did the tasting menu ($110 per person) and two of us opted for the wine pairing with it (additional $45 per person). with all the delicious looking options on the menu, it seemed this was the way to go. here's what was included: \n\n-duo of <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> and tuna \"susci\". wine pairing: adami, prosecco, veneto, n/v. the \"susci\" was the first tasting and my least favorite of all. nothing special to me. or at least i didn't get what was supposed to be special about it. the roll with the carrots was kind of gross actually. i was hoping things would turn around quickly, and they did. ohhhh they did.\n\n-roasted diver scallops, morels, sugar snap, watermelon radish & pea froth. wine pairing: iberian remix, albarino, edna valley 2009. \nthe scallops were cooked perfectly and i enjoyed the puree that was served on the side. my friend however didn't enjoy the wine that was paired with it. he's a big albarino drinker and said it tasted like \"it was sitting on the shelf a little too long.\" i didn't really notice that until he said it, but i have to agree. that could have just been a bad bottle though and not an accurate representation of the wine itself.\n\n\n-spaghetti tomato basil & <mark>Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti</mark>. wine pairing: il poggione, rosso di montalcino, tuscany 2008. i don't care what anyone says- the spaghetti was fantastic. i'm drinking the kool-aid here. yes, the sauce is very simple, but it really made me notice and appreciate the texture and freshness of the noodles more. sometimes spaghetti is better when it's simple i guess. i would definitely order it again. \n\nthe <mark>Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti</mark>- dish of the night. the three of us unanimously agreed on this. one of the best pasta dishes i've ever devoured in 10 seconds. the horseradish breadcrumbs were a great finishing touch.\n\n-fennel spiced <mark>Black Cod</mark>, concentrated tomatoes, mantecato & black olive oil. wine pairing: jermann red angel, pinot noir, friuli 2008. \nthe cod was spiced well, but maybe a tad undercooked for my liking. i still finished it. \n\n-<mark>Spiced Duck Breast</mark>, endive, preserved orange &\ncippollini. wine pairing: feudi di san gregorio, rubrato, aglianico, campania 2009. the duck was perfectly cooked and had tremendous flavor. my friend sitting next to me was already so stuffed by this point, that he couldn't eat his, so being the fat fuck that i am, i ate his too.\n\n-amedei <mark>Chocolate Cake</mark> toasted almond gelato. wine pairing: quinta do noval, colheita, tawny port, portugal 1997. i'm normally not a big dessert guy, but this cake was outstanding. perfect way to cap off the tasting.\n\n...and here were a few complimentary items our table was given to share:\n\n- bread basket. it was served with three different dips (citrus olive oil, tomato-eggplant, and marscapone butter). some of the pieces of bread had salami baked into it, and those were amazing! just try not to fill up on them if you're doing the tasting menu, because you have a lot of food on the way.\n\n- <mark>Creamy Polenta</mark> with fricassee of truffled mushrooms. the polenta was definitely one of the highlights, although it could have benefited from being a tad thicker since the mushroom sauce liquified it significantly, once mixed  in. but great flavors, nonetheless.\n\n- shoe string calamari and zucchini. i think there was some fennel in here too. we finished every last string.\n\n\nall three of us immensely enjoyed the tasting menu. to say that we were not left disappointed by the portion sizes would be an understatement. we could barely walk out of there without toppling over. i certainly didn't have much room for alcoholic beverages for the remainder of the night. probably a good thing, knowing me and vegas.\n\nyou might notice i didn't have much to say about the wines. that's because unlike the food, they were all pretty unremarkable. i'm a pretty avid wine drinker and i didn't recognize any of these wines by name before they were poured for me, so it was almost expected. if i ever did the tasting menu again, i'd most likely skip the wine pairing option and just order a bottle of something decent and familiar off their wine menu. \n\nmy biggest gripe about this place was the waiter. although friendly and accommodating, he could barely be heard over the background noise, and with his thick accent, it made him very difficult to understand. tastings obviously are supposed to be interactive and i had to ask him to repeat everything he said at least once. this became a little frustrating and kind of depreciated the experience for me. i wish he had left a copy of the menu on our table so i didn't have to go to their website afterward to finally discover what some of the things i ate were.\n\nthe bottom line is i would definitely return to scarpetta, especially since i just realized there is one in beverly hills (doh!).", 
            "i took my wife here for her 40th birthday and they knew we were coming and the reason. \n\nthis was our first time here. we arrived minutes after 9pm.\n\nthe restaurant was dimly lit. the atmosphere was loud. nothing romantic about this setting at all. \n\nhostess\n\nher greeting was like listening to an answering machine. we had a 9:30 reservation (90 min before closing) and got sat in front of a pillar. i could not see the bellagio fountains that seems to influence everybody's reviews. about 20 min later, 2 tables opened up that were right against the glass. in my reservation i let them know it was a special occasion. \n\nserver\n\nlike the hostess, it was like watching blue man group after 3 straight performances. \n\njust going through the motions. \n\nwe were not interested in cocktails or wine, but were focused on some great cuisine. the server did stop once to go over the menu, but all he did was say \"these are the apps, these are the pastas, these are the main courses\" etc. etc. they must get a lot of people who never viewed a menu before. \n\nwe ordered the misto fritto, farmers salad, fennel <mark>Black Cod</mark>, and wrapped <mark>Veal Loin</mark>. (i did not take any pictures this time, i did not want my review to be a distraction of the occasion) \n\nfood\n\nmy wife loved the complimentary bread which included dippers of olive oil, roasted eggplant and tomatoes, and truffle butter. the bread was varieties of an italian sourdough, foccacia, stromboli, and a vegetable stromboli. \n\nthey automatically split our app & salad which i appreciated. \n\nmisto fritto\n\nthe menu description was very vague, but i figured it had to be a spin off of fried calamari. tempura battered squid, white anchovies, cauliflower, and the stems of chives. there were no anchovies in my plate, and happened to be my wife's first bite on her's which she did not like at all. i would not have known about the anchovies (which i love) if i did not finish her plate. the fry was perfect, and i really liked the seasoning which included rosemary. \n\nfarmers salad\n\nthe presentation was beautiful. some of the vegetables (green & <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> squash) were almost shaved. it was a nice salad, but not much flavor. there were only 2 choices of salad on the menu and i chose this one. my wife ate only half of hers. \n\n<mark>Veal Loin</mark>\n\nthere is a picture of this dish in the archives. 3 (2oz?) wrapped pieces of veal perfectly cooked. a few pieces of carrots and another vegetable. i tasted some sort of mustard on this dish with another sauce. the menu (again) was very vague. as i ate, i was wondering what the expense was in making this dish that carried a $38 price. \n\n\n<mark>Black Cod</mark>\n\npresentation was standard, looked to be about a 5oz filet. my wife was half way through her dish without a sound. knowing my wife, this means she did not want to disappoint me in saying she did not care for it. i tried a bite and thought it was weird for cod to be so mushy. it was not pleasant at all. maybe even undercooked. \nmy wife at all the vegetables and there was half of the filet sitting alone on the plate when the busser took it away. sad that no one noticed that half of what was supposed to be the hero of this dish was being tossed out like a used tissue. \n\nwe passed on dessert because to me, dessert should be the perfect finish to a perfect meal which this whole experience was not. my wife liked the complimentary bread the best and i liked the <mark>Crispy Fritto Misto</mark> the best. there was some woman in a very loud group making noises that reminded me of farm animals in heat. \n\nit shouldn't be this way in a restaurant of this price point.   \n\ni asked for the check (1app, 1 salad, 2 entrees) $116.00 \n\nas we were getting up to leave, a person came by with a dish that said happy birthday and had 2 biscotti\"s , a cookie, a salted chocolate thingy and a lit candle.\n\nwould have went better with a cappuccino but the check was already paid. \n\nthis was a disappointing experience, even more so because i wanted it to be special for my wife's 40th. she liked the complimentary bread.....\n\nif i can say something positive and relative, i would recommend going to d.o.c g. instead. same chef, different menu. been there 5 times and loved it.",

            "had our tiny rehearsal dinner here in the private room with a lovely view of the bellagio fountains. everyone i interacted with prior to dining and throughout our actual dinner was extremely kind and accomodating. our menu was selected in advance and consisted of 4 spectacular courses all served family style except for the entrees: small shared plates (scallops, shortribs, apple endive blue cheese salad), 3 pastas (<mark>Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti</mark>, and another raviloi i forgot about bc i was drooling over the agnolotti), entrees (<mark>Roasted Organic Chicken</mark>, <mark>Black Cod</mark>, or ny strip steak) and dessert was these nutella filled doughnut holes rolled in sugar w/ a side of banana gelato, <mark>Chocolate Cake</mark> and cheesecake. everything was delicious but if i had to pick one of each it'd be the short rib appetizer, the <mark>Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti</mark>, the chicken and the nutella balls. go here if you have the opportunity!!",

            "i am a fan of scott conant from chopped fame but i have to say the las vegas outpost of his iconic nyc restaurant just did not live up to the hype.  i went with a group of guys and we ordered the tasting menu.  they were nice enough to allow us to order it on a friday night since it is usually not offered on that night of the week.  we tasted 8 dishes for $110 pp.  the quantity of food was great - really full at the end of the meal - but most of the dishes were just ok.\n\nthe real highlight for me was the <mark>Creamy Polenta</mark> with truffled mushrooms.  wow, that was delicious.  probably the creamiest polenta i've ever had and it paired so nicely with the earthiness of the truffles and mushrooms.   the <mark>Chocolate Cake</mark> served for the dessert course was also terrific, served with toasted almond gelato.  too bad i was so full by that time i could only have a couple of bites.  nothing else was particularly memorable.  \n\ndisappointing for me was the restaurant's signature spaghetti - a seemingly simple preparation of pasta, fresh tomatoes and basil.  it arrived very simply plated -  a perfect cylinder mold of spaghetti covered by a clear plastic cloche that i suppose is meant to preserve the freshness of the preparation or perhaps to concentrate the aroma.  the cloches are removed with a flourish releasing nice smells of tomato and basil.  the pasta was a bit overcooked and the sauce, while wonderfully creamy (how do they do that?) was just too sweet, as if chef conant and chef boyardee had a bastard love-child.\n\nanother disappointment was the <mark>Black Cod</mark>.  in the past i have found this fish to be among the most delicious owing to its high fat content and buttery texture and flavor.  scarpetta's rendition of this fish, pan-roasted with concentrated tomatoes and roasted fennel, was so overcooked that it was unrecognizable as <mark>Black Cod</mark>.  just a piece of fish.\n\nother dishes were a bit more successful including the <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> of <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> and tuna, the diver scallops, the short rib/<mark>Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti</mark> and the <mark>Spiced Duck Breast</mark>.\n\nthe wine list is voluminous and expensive.  the cocktail menu offers some nice selections.\n\nthere is certainly a lot of eye candy to be enjoyed at this swank place in the cosmo.  however, one annoying thing was the lighting.  over every table there is a large fixture containing multiple <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark>/gold colored lights.  this lighting casts the food in a weird color and makes taking pictures of the food impossible.  all the food looks bad in the pictures i took - i suppose that's no surprise that the pictures were a disappointment too.", 
            "this is a late review as i've been really lazy but i'm trying to catch up! i came here with my boyfriend in november 2013 for this birthday and had the tasting menu. it was nothing short of amazinnng!  i will warn you, the portions are large for a tasting menu and you will get full! ladies don't make the mistake of wearing a tight dress like i did! i was iffy about the tasting menu because i normally wouldn't choose to order most of what was on it and my boyfriend isn't a huge seafood person but we were feeling adventurous and wow were we surprised. the items i remembered the most were the <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark>, fennel dusted <mark>Black Cod</mark>, spaghetti, and the desserts! who knew simple spaghetti could be soo good! they were also sooo nice to give us three extra items on top of the tasting menu! oh and also, their bread basket is the best i've had. stromboli bread. oh my goodness, i have dreams about this bread haha. the  ambience is very romantic and dimmly lit yet didn't feel stuffy or stiff like some higher end restaurants. i wish i took pictures but since our table was in the middle of two others tables i didn't want to disturb anyone with the flash of my camera. oh and the view is really pretty! i hope to be back soon!!!",

            "*** review is for restaurant week august 2014 menu ***\n\nanother restaurant that i've wanted to try now marked off the list.  the restaurant week menu is somewhat limited in selections, but what it has was very good.\n\ni was seated next to the window overlooking the bellagio and the fountains which added to the good atmosphere of the restaurant.  i was brought menus and an iced tea.  i had to ask for the restaurant week menu and it was brought.  i had already made my choice from the online menu but sometimes things change so i wanted to make sure.\n\ni was brought a nice bread basket with sourdough and three other breads.  accompanying it was a trio of bread toppers/dippers--mascarpone butter, caponata, and a citrus infused olive oil.  all three were good, but i could have eaten a plate of the caponata!  the mild citrus flavor in the olive oil made that my second choice.\n\nfor the starter, i ordered the <mark>Creamy Polenta</mark> with fricassee of truffled mushrooms.  the polenta was brought in a white dish and the server then spooned the onion and wild mushroom mixture over the polenta.  the dish was excellent.  i almost took some bread to wipe up any leftover polenta.\n\nfor the main course, i got the fennel dusted <mark>Black Cod</mark> on a bed of concentrated tomatoes and roasted fennel.  the fish was cooker perfectly and was moist and soft but with a crisp crust.  the crust had a mild anise flavor from the fennel.  the tomatoes beneath, concentrated by baking until some of the water was rendered which gave the tomato a prominent flavor.  the roasted fennel was tasty.\n\nfor dessert, there was no choice but that didn't matter.  the bomboloni was a wonderful way to end a good meal.  the bomboloni consisted of two filled with nutella ganache and one was filled with a vanilla cream.  alongside was a small scoop of banana ice cream resting on crushed chocolate shortbread pieces.  excellent!\n\nservice was good for the most part.  two small things--when your posted opening time is 6 pm, open at 6.  seating people almost 10 minutes late is not the best form especially if someone has a show they need to get to.  also, i had two sweet 'n low wrappers on the table that neither a runner nor the server cleared even though both were by several times.  that's something you wouldn't expect from a restaurant of this class.  i'm sure chef conant would point this out if he were dining there.  i wish i didn't have to ask for the restaurant week menu.  it was a sheet of paper.  bring it with your large books of wine and dinner menus.", 
            "great spot in cosmopolitan.  maybe best italian on the strip.  i had the <mark>Black Cod</mark> which i would get again.  pasta was also outstanding.  cool, dark space with  view of bellagio fountains.  good spot for couples.", 
            "you know those few precious moments when you're absolutely falling in love with a dish? like your eyes roll back and you carefully savor each bite, wishing the experience will never end? it's an ecstasy that only a few restaurants can deliver. this describes my dinner experience at scarpetta, when i delicately pulled apart my fennel dusted spiced <mark>Black Cod</mark>. a bed of tomatoes and roasted fennel added a tangy zest to the fish. my lawd. this must be a dream. it's too good to be true!\n\nbam! snap back to reality. as i used my fork and knife to d<mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> piece of that tender cod to my mouth, i spotted a thin black line. hmm, that's an interesting lookin' spice. let me tug at it some more. lo and behold, it was a piece of hair, and it was definitely not mine. the hair was embedded in the cod's skin! i politely informed my waiter of the situation and he apologized, then asked if i would like to replace the cod with a different dish. i just wanted another cod. i wanted to return to that euphoria i was experiencing before my foodie world came crashing down on me when i discovered that unfortunate piece of keratin. \n\nlike forrest gump says, sh** happens. i understand that, but i'm at scarpetta. this is a high-caliber restaurant, one of the best in las vegas, owned by the famous chef scott conant. it's not something i would expect to happen here. my waiter was professional though, he quickly brought out another cod (since my partner was already done with his dish) and our dessert was on the house. i totally appreciate these gestures. yet, when my second cod arrived, it did not taste as heavenly as the initial one. i noticed that my second dish came out a lot faster than my first, which meant it was cooked in a shorter amount of time. the meat of my second cod looked a tad <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> it was almost rubbery in texture, not as moist and soft as my first one. there goes my foodie high. womp womp.\n\nthe kitchen staff probably invested less time and attention on my replacement dish. i know there was a slight rush to bring out my cod asap since my boyfriend already finished his entree. however, i was still paying for this dish and it was executed poorly compared to the first one. \n\nthis could have easily been a four or five star review. we asked for a table next to the window and the views of the strip and the bellagio fountains were stunning. so romantic and beautiful. my boyfriend and i started our dinner with the tuna \"susci\" with marinated vegetables and preserved truffles. this is essentially tuna wrapped around vegetables. it was almost like a sushi roll, but there was too much going on. we couldn't really tease out the tuna flavor.  \n\nmy boyfriend ordered the short rib & <mark>Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti</mark>. it's cooked in brown butter, horseradish, and toasted breadcrumbs. he said it was good but not amazingly tasty. he was still quite hungry after finishing his pasta. \n\nthe complimentary amedei <mark>Chocolate Cake</mark> with toasted almond gelato and salted caramel sauce was decadent. the chocolate was not overly sweet and the almond gelato was creamy.\n\nit wasn't purely the hair, but the fact that my second cod was unrecognizable compared to my first one. the rest of the items are pretty solid. the view is the best thing scarpetta has to offer. and maybe that <mark>Black Cod</mark>...when it is cooked properly.", 
            "authentically italian food with a modern twist in an understated, elegant and comfortable dining room. the restaurant was happening on a saturday night but there's enough space between tables that we still had a feeling of intimacy. everything was perfectly cooked in perfect combinations of ingredients. we had two starters: braised short ribs and brussel sprouts. we shared a pasta chocked full of lots of different vegetables. it had a very earthy flavor and flavors only achieved from patiently creating a reduction. the two entrees of lamb and <mark>Black Cod</mark> again featured flavors from painstaking attention and time in the kitchen. our waiter, although busy, was attentive, friendly and professional. very nice meal and i love being a little overstuffed(that's why no dessert).", 
            "had a really good dinner here. probably should've gotten the pasta as everyone raved about it, but i got the <mark>Black Cod</mark> instead. the cod was really delicious though-cooked perfectly and had a nice flavor to it. to start we had the grilled octopus and burrata--all really good. we had the sommelier help us pick a wine and we had a red blend that was amazing.", 
            "just wow. my new favorite place to dine in vegas. super swanky interior. the lights were dim and the crowd was pretty quiet when we went friday night. perfect after nursing a hangover all afternoon.\n\nthe basket of bread was thoroughly enjoyed by all at the table. it was accompanie breadd with marinated eggplant tapenade, evoo, and some whipped butter. some had prosciutto and cheese marbled in them.\n\nto start, the kumamoto oysters were fresh and light. the cocktail sauce and mingionette were both great. we also had the grilled p<mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> and diver scallop with foie gras. they portioned it out for all of us so that was really nice. the vegetables in both appetizers were very well done. everything paired nicely. we also had the uni, crab, tobiko capellini which was just ok. when you hear uni the expectation bar is set pretty high...\n\nfor my entree i had the famous spaghetti which i enjoyed. the fresh tomato and basil flavors were well balanced and the pasta wasn't too al dente which i like. my bf had the <mark>Black Cod</mark>. i thought it was ok, nothing special.\n\nto end the meal, we had the bomboloni, recommended by our server. i'm glad my party didn't skip on dessert, because it was so good. the freshly fried nutella filled donut ball was perfect paired with the light banana gelato. i'm typically not a huge fan of heavy fried desserts...but man oh man...with that gelato it was to die for.\n\noverall, food and service was excellent. of course it cost a pretty penny, but what do you expect in vegas? definitely recommend scarpetta if you are looking for some tasty eats.", 
            "i came here with my dad, expecting a wonderful meal and that's what we received. we asked our waiter if he had any recommendations and he gave us some good choices to choose from. we ended up ordering the polenta with mushrooms as an appetizer. the polenta was creamy and the truffled mushrooms added great flavor and some texture. then we ordered our main dishes. my dad ordered the <mark>Black Cod</mark> and he said he loved the dish. i ordered the veal shank and thought it was a great dish. it was cooked medium and tasted delicious. i wish there was more sauce on the veal rather than just the juices, but it was great. we also split the short rib pasta, which was decent. the pasta was fresh and made in house, which is always good. and the short rib was tasty, but after a few bites, the pasta kind of seemed redundant and too hefty. following the main course, we ordered two desserts. we ordered the mini donuts with nutella which were sweet and a bit of a mess. then we had the gluten free, dairy free, chocolate ice cream parfait. it was extremely delicate, yet delicious. overall, our experience was great and our waiter truly helped us choose some great dishes. i would come here again, next time i'm in las vegas."

            "last friday we came in at 9.30. the place was packed and the girls at the reception told us that we could eat at the bar or at the small tables on the opposite side of the bar. we choose to wait at the bar for a table in the restaurant, where it seemed to be more quiet. they told us the wait could be up to an hour, but we didn't really care.\n\nwe allready had a few cocktails before we came in, so i started to drink lots of water. we had to share our snack basket (patato chips, nice!) with the people sitting next to us. they shove it to their side of the bar, we didn't steal it back, so far the enjoyment of snacks. \n\nafter about 30 minutes it seemed like more and more people came in without reservation, but they were all given a table in the restaurant. we were still enjoying the bottled water, but after an hour waiting, my boyfriend walked up to the reception and they made our table ready, thanking us for the long wait. when we were seated, we noticed that the restaurant wasn't that full anymore. we were seated at a table apart from the other guest, in the corner of an almost empty room, where it wasn't that warm. they gave us some really nice bread and i didn't want to be snobby, but i did ask for another table. they were very nice and gave us a table by the window, overlooking the b fountains. not that we especially wanted that, but we did like to sit closer to other people. experiencing a restaurant isn't just about the food, it's also he temperature, the views, looking at other guest and the over all service.\n\nanyway, after this, everything was great. my boyfriend and i shared 4 courses, which were all perfectly made: the tartare, the <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark>, the <mark>Roasted Organic Chicken</mark> and the goat cheese cake. i was really stuffed (i also had 3 bottles of water) and happy. service was great, although we were asked a little to much if everything was okay. in holland we are not used to all that attentiveness.\n\n6 stars for the food, 4 for the somewhat weird start = 5 stars.", 
            "i loved it here. the atmosphere was relaxed, the view of the strip was gorgeous, and the service was excellent.\n\ni had the casonsei which i highly recommend, especially if you're a vegetarian, and my boyfriend had the <mark>Roasted Organic Chicken</mark>. he said it was very juicy and full of flavor.\n\nfor dessert, we had the zeppole. it was filled with nutella. that's all i have to say for you to know that you should get it.", 
            "i ate dinner here with seven other friends a few weeks ago and the atmosphere is lovely, the service was bad.  everyone we talked to before coming here said the spaghetti was awesome! 2 friends got that and it was okay, noodles slightly too undercooked and i like it aldenti, and two people got a lobster tagalini and their stomachs were upset after,  i got the <mark>Roasted Organic Chicken</mark> and when i cut into the wing part it was bloody and i discreetly let the server know and he left the breast half with me and took back only the wing, he was gone for about 15 min, nowhere to be found, when he returned i explained that i wasn't eating the breast part and he explained that is the way they cook it, with his hand in my face i had to back my chair up, that was rude and not true, my aunt got the same dish and hers was cooked through... i would not return after this experience.", 
            "wow! i was not expecting to love scarpetta as much as i did. after a rather disappointing dining experience at mastro's steakhouse the night before, i needed some italian comfort food! from the moment we walked in i was in love. i love the lighting and the cozy booths next to the bar looked very inviting and i was hoping we would be sat at one. thank god we weren't! instead we were lead into the main dining room which has a perfect view of the bellagio and bellagio fountains! we not only had an amazing dinner but also enjoyed the fountain show every 1/2 hour. \n\nnow on to the actual meal. first of all, the bread selection in the basket are delicious! there was a prosciutto and mozzarella roll that was just to die for! for an appetizer we went with the heirloom tomato salad. yummy! next up we shared one of the pasta dishes that was on special. i can't remember what it was called, which is unfortunate because it was outstanding. next we shared the <mark>Roasted Organic Chicken</mark>, also very good! we shared a side of the carrots which were great. the combination of honey and the crunch of the nuts made the cooked carrots really stand out. \n\nbesides the meal itself, the service was outstanding. since we shared each plate our server made sure that the items were split onto two plates so that we didn't have to reach across the table to get bites of food. our water glasses never went below half full and our server was very attentive. \n\ni will definitely visit scarpetta on my future visits to vegas.", 
            "the food was ok, we got pici and the portion was small and very fishy tasting. the bread was great and it comes with oil and a butter and a ciabatta which is excellent. i got the <mark>Roasted Organic Chicken</mark> which was cruncy on the outside and moist on the inside. the wine list is extensive, the glass was pricy. we had a group of 4 guys next to us that had been drinking and they were loud and obnoxious, so it was not the best for me and the wife. it is in vegas so that maybe expected. the pricing seemed a bit high.", 
            "had our tiny rehearsal dinner here in the private room with a lovely view of the bellagio fountains. everyone i interacted with prior to dining and throughout our actual dinner was extremely kind and accomodating. our menu was selected in advance and consisted of 4 spectacular courses all served family style except for the entrees: small shared plates (scallops, shortribs, apple endive blue cheese salad), 3 pastas (<mark>Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti</mark>, and another raviloi i forgot about bc i was drooling over the agnolotti), entrees (<mark>Roasted Organic Chicken</mark>, <mark>Black Cod</mark>, or ny strip steak) and dessert was these nutella filled doughnut holes rolled in sugar w/ a side of banana gelato, <mark>Chocolate Cake</mark> and cheesecake. everything was delicious but if i had to pick one of each it'd be the short rib appetizer, the <mark>Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti</mark>, the chicken and the nutella balls. go here if you have the opportunity!!", 
            "i had high expectations coming to this place. extremely high expectations. for all the attention to detail and harsh criticisms that scott has on chopped, i anticipated a true culinary masterpiece. \n\nmy girlfriend and i weren't that hungry, because we had already had an early dinner, but decided to give this place a shot because it was the only day that would have worked with our trip to las vegas. we thought the best thing to do would be to just order an appetizer and only one course each, as opposed to the traditional multiple courses with a true italian meal. we ordered the short ribs as an appetizer, i ordered the spaghetti and my girlfriend ordered the <mark>Roasted Organic Chicken</mark>.\n\nthe best part of the meal was the bread. you heard me. the best part of the meal was the bread. i must say, i had high hopes going in, higher hopes after the bread, because that was good bread. the focaccia was tasty, with the right amount of rosemary and well developed. it tasted fresh and airy. the other breads were also very good. \n\nwe got our appetizer, and it was very small - which is usual for a good italian place, since it's expected that you order multiple courses. this wasn't an appetizer though, it was basically an amuse-bouche. the ribs had good flavor, and the risotto was good as well, it good texture, but i would have liked it to be cooked a little longer - it wasn't crunchy, but it was still slightly underdone. \n\nout come our main courses. \n\nmy pasta is placed on the table, and the server removes the cloche. my first impression? \"this is a main course?\" i counted how many bites it took me to finish that pasta, and it was nine. literally nine. it was such a small meal that i was still slightly hungry afterwards - even though i wasn't all that hungry coming in. and as for the flavor? i think barilla pasta and prego sauce tastes about the same, as long as you add some fresh basil, which was the only saving grace. but for $24, this was ludicrous. the pasta was just about al dente as well, so there was good texture. and as for the chicken? horrible. absolutely horrible. and small. i asked the server about the preparation, and he noted that it is brined with anise and some other flavors, which were conspicuously missing from the flavor of the dish. i ended up spending around $80 on just these three items, and definitely was left wondering why. scarpetta gets the award for most over-promised, under-delivered food experience i've had so far. it was so bad that any time i see scott on chopped or any other show, i feel like he has no idea what he is talking about. avoid this place, and go to secret pizza just down the hall instead - you'll save money, eat tastier food, and leave with a better experience.", 
            "ah scarpetta. restaurant of my all-time favorite judge on chopped-scott conant, every episode i ever watched featuring scott added a grain of sand on top of the ever growing mountain that was my dream of dining at scarpetta. by the time i finally walked through those doors it was an mount kilimanjaro sized monstrosity of a dream. i was so giddy i took a picture with the frickin sign. i mean this was it! i was going to eat pasta the way it has to be sauced up and cooked, i was about to have a symphony of flavors dancing their way onto my modest palette opening my eyes to a culinary world that which i have never experienced in my 24 years. i was about to be blown away. \n\nwe're seated by the window with a nice view of the bellagio water show. oh things were going as i expected at this point. \n\nour server was nice, in a very proper, sophisticated, would not smile more than a 3/4 grin, and maintained an impressive monotone demeanor kind of way that which you expect at such a dining establishment. everything is going according to plan. \n\nwe order the short rib risotto appetizer to share and i decide to get the <mark>Roasted Organic Chicken</mark> as my entree while my partner in crime got the so raved upon spaghetti. as we waited for our entree the bread basket came out. there was a variety of different breads some stuffed with salami and cheese, and others with spinach and garlic all served with olive oil, cheese spread, and olive tapenade. \n\nholy crap. i ate this bread and thought oh my god this is it, this is what i've been missing. the flavor was bright and salty, the outside was crusty and chewy but the inside was tender and soft. dip that into the olive oil and you're in heaven. i'm literally on cloud 9 at this point....\n\nout comes the short rib risotto that they kindly split into two plates. \n\nfirst impression: are we minions? i mean i know it's \"gourmet\", and i know we split it. but i kid you not when i tell you my portion was probably 2 tablespoons. it's okay though we're at scarpetta. i took a bite. the piece of short rib was juicy, soft, and boldly flavored. i liked it. the risotto was pretty good-the vegetables still had a nice crunch and it was a nice little bed for the short rib to sit on. not blow my mind amazing, but good! pretty good!\n\nokay the entrees! we get our hot plates and gracefully decide to not mention the fact that both of our dishes combined could probably hide behind an iphone 6 plus. we couldn't risk ruining the moment. but after taking a bite of my japanese raised chicken that had eaten nothing but the finest grains before being swiftly beheaded, and brined in an anise spiced mixture for days before arriving at my disposal....i realized something. it didn't taste good. in fact it didn't taste like anything. i could hear scott ripping a contestant to shreds for making chicken thats dry and needs a sauce, vegetables that have no love, and an overall dish with nothing bringing it all together. how could this be the cooking of the man whose every critique i felt i could so passionately agree? \n\nafter i had a bite of the spaghetti was when the depression truly set in. not only was i excited to try this dish because of scott's particular distaste for a mediocre bowl of pasta, but ted allen also picked the dish as the best thing he ever ate on food network's show as well. this dish had so much going for it. \n\nverdict? so painstakingly ordinary. the sauce had nothing really special about it-it was a bland, under seasoned tomato sauce, and for being homemade the pasta didn't really have that chewy bite you'd expect. oh let me also add that it was a 9 bite portion (we counted). \n\nneedless to say we decided to skip dessert, and i the girl who pranced in scarpetta walked out like a little girl whose mom lost her bunny rabbit because she wanted her to \"play\" outside. oh wait...that was me too. \n\nscarpetta, you disappointed me-and for that i nominate scott to the chopping block. i think i'll stick with alex guarnaschelli's opinions for now.", 
            "the restaurant itself was very nice, we got a table right by the window where it had a great view. the menu was very simple. we ordered the braised short rib as an appetizer, the meat was very tender and had lost of flavor. we ordered the <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark> and it wasnt as good as people on <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> said it to be. the sauce was a very sweet but bitter sauce and overall wasnt that good. we also had the <mark>Roasted Organic Chicken</mark> which was good, but had that same sauce that made it taste funny. we ordered the spaghetti just to try it, and it was very plain, no meatballs, and the noodles were a little harder than what they shouldve been. for dessert, we had the <mark>Coconut Panna Cotta</mark> that had caramelized pineapples and a guava soup with ice cream which was so good!"

            "i mangia'd molto bene at scarpetta during my most recent trip to the strip.  the ambiance at this sophistocated cosmopolitan restaurant is very sexy, and we were fortunate enough to be seated by the huge picture window with views of the bellagio fountains spraying in the background.  to enjoy your meal at scarpetta as i did, follow these instructions and thank me later:\n\n1) start of with a glass of gosset.  there aren't many wines by the glass to choose from on the menu, but a glass of gosset (even if it'll set you back $20 for a singular champagne flute of this nectar from the gods) is worth it.\n\n2) sample the <mark>Crispy Fritto Misto</mark> and wagyu beef tartare to start.  sure, these are old italiano standbys, but they do it up here, adding cured egg, parmigiano, toasted hazelnuts, and sea salt to the tartare.  so good.\n\n3) devour the black farfalle (with maine lobster) and the <mark>Spiced Duck Breast</mark> (with endive, preserved orange, and delicious cippollini onion).  i split these dishes with my friend and it was the perfect portion size, not to mention scrumptious.  jersey was a good choice to wear during this meal.\n\n4) polish it all off with the zeppole for dessert, if you're a fan of nutella.\n\ngrazie mille, scarpetta, for a wonderful experience!  i will definitely be back to try your famous spaghetti.", 
            "even though it's located in the mall-ish portion of the cosmo, place is very elegant, with great views if you get a window seat.\n\nfood was very good, we had the scallop appetizer, <mark>Spiced Duck Breast</mark> and <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark> entrees, and goat cheese cheesecake for dessert. everything came out perfect, and service was excellent.", 
            "as guest we felt like a burden instead of welcomed and we found the foods  we tried as one dimensional and under seasoned , flat and the dessert awful . maybe they just weren't in the working flow of things yet or maybe it just was an off night i don't know.\n\nthe door was wide open at 5:25 so we walked in and the hostess told us to make a reservation for 5:30 and to leave and come back in a few minutes . we thought that seemed odd but thought it was just because she was very young and figured that was all it was and came back a few minutes latter .\n\ntoo start with i received a white lint filled napkin on top of my black pants , but i did notice they have black linen napkins they use for the wine bottles. \n\nwe felt uncomfortable the whole time dining because most of the time i saw up to eleven members of staff were standing across from us with their backs against the wall just looking out into our direction . i glared at them a few times but they didn't budge .\n\nwe started with the <mark>Tuna susci</mark> -described as marinated vegetables with preserved truffles , everything was <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> everything had little taste.\n\nwe shared the <mark>Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti</mark> , that were like mini raviolis filled with short rib that had a baby food texture inside the well made pasta. maybe ten percent of the  agnolottis we topped with a scant amount of toasted  crumbs slightly laced with horseradish for flavor that were resting in some browned butter.\n\nthe <mark>Black Cod</mark> although cooked nicely would have been forgettable but was not , only because of the concentrated tomato that i found interesting .  this dish was extremely mild and under seasoned with a few pieces of fennel that were nicely caramelized .\n\nmy husband had the <mark>Spiced Duck Breast</mark> and he said it was his least favorite one he ever had since the skin wasn't crispy and also lacked flavor , he thought it wasn't seasoned at all .\n\nwe had a little time to kill before the show so we thought maybe dessert might be good . we ordered the zeppole i don't mean to be mean or disrespectful but honest to god they tasted just like the chocolate muffins of the sweet tomatoes salad bar buffet , the zeppole were bread like , not sweet , almost not chocolate flavored and only a few zeppole not all had essence of nutella in them . \n\nat this price range they don't have this much room for error.", 
            "the final meal of our vegas escapade was well spent at scarpetta. it wasn't completely perfect but most of the night made up for the little missteps (we'll get to that later) so for the most part, i had nothing but a good time. attentive service, rich indulgent food, all housed within an intimate space with gorgeous views of the ballagio fountains, we closed our trip in pure hedonistic style.\n\nwe started with some of their signature cocktails as we browsed the menu. upon the recommendation from our fantastic server, and the joys of libation, we decided on the tasting menu ($99) and accompanying wine pairing ($49) since several of the dishes that we wanted to try were on it anyway and boy did we pick right. that was the beginning of six courses of pure pleasure.\n\nwe started with a sashimi plate (http://www.<mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark>.com/biz_photos/0nmtwqyeqikerdv4a55obg?select=yvhgcff5cqsiopyc83uwwa) which consisted of <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> with a drizzle of ginger oil and red onions. the other half of the plate sat the <mark>Tuna susci</mark> - tuna wrapped marinated vegetables. the fish was so fresh and the flavors were delicately balanced. the bread basket came shortly after and there was a nice selection including yummy foccacia and stromboli. as part of the tasting menu, the chef also threw in a couple of surprises and we were treated to a delightful seafood <mark>Crispy Fritto Misto</mark> for this course. perfectly crispy fried but not oily, every bite was yummy and the rock shrimp just melted in my mouth.  \n\nthe next course was a perfectly roasted sea scallop. (http://www.<mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark>.com/biz_photos/0nmtwqyeqikerdv4a55obg?select=06qyvnxbie8hftnykn4obw) it was a joy to eat and the velvety salmoriglio sauce was a nice accompaniment to the sweet and juicy scallop. the chef's extra this course was a polenta with a truffle mushroom stew. (http://www.<mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark>.com/biz_photos/0nmtwqyeqikerdv4a55obg?select=gtrwgpr4xgghmw0rvryanw) for the record i hate cornmeal and thus hate grits, tamales, and polenta. yet, i could not stop eating this polenta. the flavors of the mushroom stew combine with the impeccably smooth polenta. (i suspect there's a whole lot more butter in it than what chef scott conant lets on) it was a nice double headliner with the scallop. \n\nnext up was the pasta course and chef conant's signature tomato & basil spaghetti. (http://www.<mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark>.com/biz_photos/0nmtwqyeqikerdv4a55obg?select=jqrljq4g8bgizxs0bc8bow) fresh made pasta in a simple tomato basil (+ quarter stick of butter) sauce but just perfectly executed. while i thoroughly enjoyed it, the chef's extra this course, the <mark>Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti</mark> with brown butter horseradish & toasted breadcrumb (http://www.<mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark>.com/biz_photos/0nmtwqyeqikerdv4a55obg?select=wzfcolektvylois628h_ag), totally blew my mind. wow who would have thought that the combination of short ribs, horseradish, and toasted breadcrumbs could be so sublime? i miss it already as i speak. \n\nthe next course was the <mark>Black Cod</mark>. (http://www.<mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark>.com/biz_photos/0nmtwqyeqikerdv4a55obg?select=2tmoceavt5t4aeu8j6itra) again perfectly seared but wonderfully moist in the middle. the fatty fish absolutely stands out against the sauce and caramelized fennel. delicious. the next entree course was a the <mark>Spiced Duck Breast</mark>. (http://www.<mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark>.com/biz_photos/0nmtwqyeqikerdv4a55obg?select=br1frh72uravjtrhiq6w-a) while this was my least favorite dish of the night, it was still absolutely delicious which tells you the quality of the food all night. the orange and spices (i kept picking up 5 spice) worked well with gamy duck. all in all, a successful combination. \n\nfinal course and dessert was a <mark>Chocolate Cake</mark> with toasted almond gelato and caramel. (http://www.<mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark>.com/biz_photos/0nmtwqyeqikerdv4a55obg?select=udi5apzqgqwuqcgjvukosg) this is where i really had to throw in the towel after all that eating. the <mark>Chocolate Cake</mark> was really rich and decadent and i could only finish half of it but i just couldn't let the toasted almond gelato go to waste. it was just delicious. you can totally taste the toasted flavor. \n\nnow on to the kink of the night. since we were seated by the wine cellar, the sommelier came by several times to retrieve bottles of wine. each single time, he let the door hit me as i was eating without even acknowledging it, much less apologize. not that it was a deal breaker but you expect a little more basic courtesy especially when you're dropping good money on dinner. \n\nstill for a wonderfully decadent meal paired with friendly and attentive service, we had a good time and i strongly recommend scarpetta if you want to treat yourself to a fine meal on the strip.", 
            "the bread basket alone would bring me back! that stromboli is amazing! i love salami and bread, so put the two together.....fuggetaboutit!\n\nwe had the tasting menu: \n\n- duo of <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> and tuna \"susci\": melt in your mouth delicious!\n\n- roasted sea scallops, cauliflower, bottarga, chili and caper salmoriglio: sea scallops can be rubbery and chewy if not cooked properly, but at scarpetta, they were cooked to perfection. they had the consistency of flaky, firm fish and the roasted cauliflower was a perfect pairing.\n\n- spagetti tomato basil - simple and good, but not memorable.\n\n- <mark>Black Cod</mark>, caramelized fennel & concentrated tomatoes - the fish was nice and flakey and the tomatoes added a nice acidity to the fish. i'm not a fan of fennel as they are too \"licorice-y\" in flavor for my taste.\n\n- <mark>Spiced Duck Breast</mark>, endive, preserved orange and cippollini - delicious! i love duck, but i hate when its not cooked properly or tastes overly fatty. this was a perfect balance. the preserved orange cut through the richness of the duck. yum!\n\n- amedei <mark>Chocolate Cake</mark> & toasted almond gelato - toasted almond gelato & salted caramel sauce. self explanatory....it was heaven!\n\nwhat made this experience special was that the chef brought out a few mini appetizers with every dish served, so it was like having an \"extended\" tasting menu. he brought out:\n\n- <mark>Crispy Fritto Misto</mark> - seafood, vegetables, artichokes, herbs & lemon\n- <mark>Creamy Polenta</mark> - fricassee of truffled mushrooms: by far my favorite dish at scarpetta. upon first glance, it looks like it would be too heavy and rich, but it was amazing!\n- <mark>Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti</mark> - brown butter horseradish & toasted breadcrumb.\n- zeppole - nutella center, vanilla sauce and candied hazelnuts. need i say more?\n\ni loved the ambiance and service of this restaurant. we were seated by the window facing the fountains of bellagio. a beautiful place to take someone on a date!", 
            "i tried the tasting menu with wine pairing and i nearly died from how full i became.  i ordered the tasting menu because i was unsure about what to chose from the menu - there were quite a few dishes i was torn between and i decided to just give them all a shot since a lot of the items i wanted to try was on the tasting menu.\n\nthe food and wine pairing was a great experience.  the service was impeccable - they gave me extra dishes to sample in addition to my tasting menu.  the fresh made potato chips sitting at the bar was also a temptation that i kept on coming back for.  \n\nthe stand out dishes i tried that night were:\n\npolenta - wow, never had i had polenta as silky as this before.  the mushrooms and sauce were perfect with the polenta.  i savored every bit of it.\n\nspaghetti - this definitely hit the spot.  the noodles were hand made and the sauce was quite simple, but elegant.  a very simple dish but i was in love with it.\n\n<mark>Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti</mark> - the first few bites were surprising, but what i loved about it would be the kick the horseradish that was in the sauce gave it.  each bit teased my tongue and i couldn't help but go back for seconds!\n\n<mark>Spiced Duck Breast</mark> - my favorite dish from all of the ones i tried that night.  the <mark>Spiced Duck Breast</mark> was very tender, had a bit of au jus in them and didn't have a game-y taste to it.  the <mark>Spiced Duck Breast</mark> was cooked to perfection, with the meat being so very tender and the skin having a bit of a crunch to it and the endive and sauce went so well with it.  \n\nit was a lovely dining experience.  i wouldn't mind coming again and ordering one of these delightful dishes a la cart.", 
            "prime location, delicious food, and great service...our meal at scarpetta was definitely one of the highlights of our vegas trip. there were a few missteps on our food adventure, but not nearly discouraging enough to detract from the overall experience. \n\nwe made reservations for 6:30 on thursday night, which seemed to be the latest time to arrive and get one of the tables overlooking the bellagio fountains. we got the last one available. the only issue with the view is that there is a giant metal bar running exactly eye level across the window, so you have to pop your head up like a little meercat just to get a glimpse of the fountains. oh well.\n\nwe ordered the tasting menu and told the waiter that we'd like a bottle of white wine, somewhere in the semi-sweet to semi dry range, full-to-medium bodied, in the $50-60 range. the waiter brought us two options to taste, and we went with a delicious riesling. the bread course came with a lovely tray of marscapone cheese whipped butter, lemon infused olive oil, and a delicious fresh tomato spread. we didn't eat too much, because we knew we had seven courses of awesome heading our way:\n\n1) the first course was <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> and tuna sushi. the <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> was served with thin pink rock salt wafers that complemented the fish perfectly. the tuna was rolled around marinated vegetables and served with preserved mushrooms. everything was light, fresh, and flavorful. an excellent way to start a meal. a <mark>Crispy Fritto Misto</mark> came on the side - the tempura fried herbs and lemon were a delicious addition to the standard tempura fare - shrimp...veggies...etc.\n\n2) the second course was a sea scallop served on top of cauliflower, with a cauliflower puree, chili oil, and a salad with capers on top. - the capers were a bit salty for my liking, so i pulled them off, and the cauliflower with the cauliflower puree was a little redundant, but oh. my. goodness. that scallop was the best i've ever had. the crust was perfectly carmelized, and the scallop inside was tender and melted in your mouth. the small trace of heat from the chili oil added an unexpected twist to the dish and really took it to another level. \n\n3) the chef added in course number three - <mark>Creamy Polenta</mark> with truffled mushrooms. my biggest complaint here is that i can never eat anyone else's polenta again. amazing doesn't even begin to describe it. my friend and i dove into this lake of creamy, buttery, savory goodness with reckless abandon, knowing full well that we were completely spoiling our appetite for the four remaining courses. if nobody had been watching, i would have licked the bowl. we took a little break before moving on in the meal.\n\n4) the pasta course was both a super high and super low note in the meal. after seeing scott conant revered as the king of spaghetti on television time after time, we finally got to see what all the fuss was about. the simple spaghetti dish was amazing. i have never had pasta so perfectly al dente. there was a bite to it that other pastas lack, almost to the point where you feel like it will stick in your teeth, but it doesn't. it was served with a fresh tomato basil sauce that was so perfect, it didn't need any fancy infused oils or architechtural garnishes. it was just pasta perfection. \nhowever, the short ribs angnolotti with brown butter horseradish sauce was just awful. the horseradish sauce blew away every other flavor on the plate, and it wound up tasting like a big plate of mustard. this is the awkward thing about not liking a dish in a tasting course - we were only halfway through the meal and we'd had such good courses previously, that we felt a little awkward sending it back...so we just moved forward with the meal.\n\n5) the next course was a <mark>Black Cod</mark> with concentrated tomato sauce and carmelized fennel. perfect crispy skin, rich, flavorful sauce, and crunchy fresh veggies - definitely a hit.\n\n6) <mark>Spiced Duck Breast</mark> with endive, cippolini onions, and a preserved orange - this dish was ingenious. the duck, endive, and onion were perfectly cooked, but it was the addition of the super thin slice of sweet preserved orange that really made the dish. \n\n7) dessert - simply outstanding - a chocolate lava cake on a streak of carmel sauce with toasted almond gelato on a bed of chocolate cookie crumbs, with a delicate twirl of chocolate as a garnish. \n\nthe only problem with this meal is that it was so delicious, there was no way you could leave anything on your plate. my friend and i polished off every dish - which left us feeling so full that we barely made it out of the restaurant.\n\nif you decide to attempt this delicious seven course food adventure - open your wallets wide - food, drinks, and tip set us back $350...but it was well worth it.", 
            "service: top notch\nfood: great\nambiance: great\n\nsat myself at the bar area. very small awkward area with the little tables next to the bar, would be pissed if someone sat me there. a very nice dude named nikolai welcomed me with a smile and gave me a menu. immediately decided between the <mark>Spiced Duck Breast</mark> and the <mark>Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti</mark>. nikolai the bartender/server suggested the..\n\n<mark>Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti</mark>\nbrown butter horseradish & toasted breadcrumb $25\n\nif the restaurant wasn't a fancy one, i would have licked my plate. my only complaint is there was not a large helping and i would have liked a little more food (when dont i want more food?).\n\ndrank two san remo's (fruity.. yum!) and a billionaire (too citrus-y.. eh and i really like citrus-y things).\n\nservice was good, my drink was always full and the bread was good. i'd recommend reservations highly, the dining room area seats about 100 people. some of the tables even have a view of the bellagio water fountains.. cooooool. will definately have to be back for a full dinner one night (and not when i'm just trying to get something in my stomach before i drink alot of booze at the blvd pool).\n\nafter 3 drinks and my entree bill was $73 before tip.",

            "my friend had tried the scarpetta in la and had raved about it, so when she came to town we had to try the one at the cosmopolitan hotel. she was absolutely right (she usually is ;) and i have been back several times since first trying it with her. \n\nthe restaurant is beautifully done .. very contemporary and chic .. and most every seat boasts a fabulous view of the bellagio fountain show. it's a great place for entertaining out-of-town guests for sure. one time we even had the privilege of being seated at the \"chefs\" table (which is in a private room) with a prime view of the fountain show and the entire kitchen. \n\nthe food .. what can i say .. everything we've tried there is spectacular! my favorites are the <mark>Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti</mark>, which is simply melt-in-your mouth goodness and the tagliatelle with fall vegetables, truffle zabagalione & guanciale, which is just the right amount of truffle and is nice and light. i've also tried that famous spaghetti .. it's good, very good, but not something that i would order again. some of my dining partners have tried the lobster pasta, the <mark>Black Cod</mark> and the <mark>Spiced Duck Breast</mark> and the little bites i tried were good, but not necessarily items i would order. \n\nfrom the starters, my favorites are the <mark>Creamy Polenta</mark>, again with truffle :) and the <mark>Braised Short Ribs of Beef</mark>. the calamari and the scallops are also good, but we keep going back to the polenta. \n\ndessert .. the most important part of the meal .. the second time we were there, we saw something at another table that looked delicious and right up our alley .. turns out it was not on their menu but from the neighboring scott conant eatery docg enoteca. it's called the salted caramel budino with pretzel toffee.  it is super creamy and  the perfect balance of both sweet and salty at the same time. we shared it the first go-around but now order one each whenever we go .. and that rarely happens. \n\nthe service is impeccable, friendly knowledgeable servers and bussers who go the extra mile and have great personalities. the first time we were there my dining partner mentioned she was heading to dc the following weekend and our server came back with a list of fun things / places for her to do while she was there.",

            "after reading all of the great reviews, i am really excited to go to this restaurant.  we made a reservation because, online it said that they were recommended, but there were not many people in the place. we got the suggested appetizer of the <mark>Tuna susci</mark> and it was delicious! the waiter even had the kitchen split it onto two plates so my boyfriend and i could share.  it was delicious with white truffles in the middle and very well seasoned. my boyfriend ordered the black squid pasta with seafood because the reviews raved about it--it really wasn't that great.  it actually smelled and tasted a little overly fishy, but he was a good sport and ate it all.  i order the <mark>Spiced Duck Breast</mark>, and the duck was cooked perfectly.  the only suggestion i have is that the duck was cut very thick and there was not enough of the delicious orange glaze.  it was good, but not over the top amazing.  we were pretty full but ordered the st<mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> shortcake for dessert---omg amazing!  it definitely made up for the mediocre dinner. the service was really great, the dinner was blah, and the dessert was really good.  i would recommend this place, but i would not come here again.  there are too many other great restaurants in las vegas, this definitely has the atmosphere but i do not think our dinner was worth 150$.", 
            "skip the primi, dive into the secondi.  scarpetta excels at pasta.\n\nwhile it is true, a recent trip to italy has forever altered my perception of italian food (the reason for the loss of a star), scarpetta delivers with an italian chic d\\u00e9cor, light spirited service, contemporary plating, and italian cooking sensibility.\n\nstraight to the pastas.  plated as a secondi (second course before the main), portions are smaller.  do like the italians, save your bread to mop up the left over sauce once you finish the pasta.  trust me, do it, you'll understand.\n\nthe tagliatelle with a truffle zabaglione and guanciale, a take on carbonara is excellent.  all the flavor of carbonara are there, just lighter. the pasta is toothsome and near perfect.\n\nduck and <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark>.  thin sheets of translucent pasta around packets of duck and melting foie.  glazed with a sweet marsala and duck stock reduction.  the sauce is enriched with dribbles of foie fat as the little packets are broken open.\n\nfinally, the spaghetti with tomato and basil is a take on amatriciana.  simple, fresh pure of tomato, hint of fresh basil.  clean flavor.\n\nalthough i'm happy with two or three pastas, most think i've gone foodie crazy so if you must, the  mains.  the <mark>Spiced Duck Breast</mark> with endive, preserved orange, and cipollini onions is excellent.  perfectly rendered, the skin of the rare duck is crisp with no cloying underlying <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark>.  it's earthy, ducky flavor cut by the sauce of preserved orange and duck jus creates a very well balanced dish.  not to be outdone, the fennel spiced <mark>Black Cod</mark>.  hints of licorice taint the delicate flavor of the cod, the acidity of tomatoes and the briny, salty flavor of olives elevate it.  unfortunately, i couldn't find the mantecato of baccala the menu promised.  all good, the dish worked.\n\ngreat wine list.  heavy emphasis on italy.  \n\nis scarpetta truly italian?  no.  (you should still tip your server; i miss italy).  it does however, deliver a great experience.", 
            "so while at a convention in vegas, my two co-workers and i came here for dinner on 10/6/13 on a recommendation from a friend who claimed it's the best restaurant in the city. all three of us did the tasting menu ($110 per person) and two of us opted for the wine pairing with it (additional $45 per person). with all the delicious looking options on the menu, it seemed this was the way to go. here's what was included: \n\n-duo of <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> and tuna \"susci\". wine pairing: adami, prosecco, veneto, n/v. the \"susci\" was the first tasting and my least favorite of all. nothing special to me. or at least i didn't get what was supposed to be special about it. the roll with the carrots was kind of gross actually. i was hoping things would turn around quickly, and they did. ohhhh they did.\n\n-roasted diver scallops, morels, sugar snap, watermelon radish & pea froth. wine pairing: iberian remix, albarino, edna valley 2009. \nthe scallops were cooked perfectly and i enjoyed the puree that was served on the side. my friend however didn't enjoy the wine that was paired with it. he's a big albarino drinker and said it tasted like \"it was sitting on the shelf a little too long.\" i didn't really notice that until he said it, but i have to agree. that could have just been a bad bottle though and not an accurate representation of the wine itself.\n\n\n-spaghetti tomato basil & <mark>Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti</mark>. wine pairing: il poggione, rosso di montalcino, tuscany 2008. i don't care what anyone says- the spaghetti was fantastic. i'm drinking the kool-aid here. yes, the sauce is very simple, but it really made me notice and appreciate the texture and freshness of the noodles more. sometimes spaghetti is better when it's simple i guess. i would definitely order it again. \n\nthe <mark>Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti</mark>- dish of the night. the three of us unanimously agreed on this. one of the best pasta dishes i've ever devoured in 10 seconds. the horseradish breadcrumbs were a great finishing touch.\n\n-fennel spiced <mark>Black Cod</mark>, concentrated tomatoes, mantecato & black olive oil. wine pairing: jermann red angel, pinot noir, friuli 2008. \nthe cod was spiced well, but maybe a tad undercooked for my liking. i still finished it. \n\n-<mark>Spiced Duck Breast</mark>, endive, preserved orange &\ncippollini. wine pairing: feudi di san gregorio, rubrato, aglianico, campania 2009. the duck was perfectly cooked and had tremendous flavor. my friend sitting next to me was already so stuffed by this point, that he couldn't eat his, so being the fat fuck that i am, i ate his too.\n\n-amedei <mark>Chocolate Cake</mark> toasted almond gelato. wine pairing: quinta do noval, colheita, tawny port, portugal 1997. i'm normally not a big dessert guy, but this cake was outstanding. perfect way to cap off the tasting.\n\n...and here were a few complimentary items our table was given to share:\n\n- bread basket. it was served with three different dips (citrus olive oil, tomato-eggplant, and marscapone butter). some of the pieces of bread had salami baked into it, and those were amazing! just try not to fill up on them if you're doing the tasting menu, because you have a lot of food on the way.\n\n- <mark>Creamy Polenta</mark> with fricassee of truffled mushrooms. the polenta was definitely one of the highlights, although it could have benefited from being a tad thicker since the mushroom sauce liquified it significantly, once mixed  in. but great flavors, nonetheless.\n\n- shoe string calamari and zucchini. i think there was some fennel in here too. we finished every last string.\n\n\nall three of us immensely enjoyed the tasting menu. to say that we were not left disappointed by the portion sizes would be an understatement. we could barely walk out of there without toppling over. i certainly didn't have much room for alcoholic beverages for the remainder of the night. probably a good thing, knowing me and vegas.\n\nyou might notice i didn't have much to say about the wines. that's because unlike the food, they were all pretty unremarkable. i'm a pretty avid wine drinker and i didn't recognize any of these wines by name before they were poured for me, so it was almost expected. if i ever did the tasting menu again, i'd most likely skip the wine pairing option and just order a bottle of something decent and familiar off their wine menu. \n\nmy biggest gripe about this place was the waiter. although friendly and accommodating, he could barely be heard over the background noise, and with his thick accent, it made him very difficult to understand. tastings obviously are supposed to be interactive and i had to ask him to repeat everything he said at least once. this became a little frustrating and kind of depreciated the experience for me. i wish he had left a copy of the menu on our table so i didn't have to go to their website afterward to finally discover what some of the things i ate were.\n\nthe bottom line is i would definitely return to scarpetta, especially since i just realized there is one in beverly hills (doh!).", 
            "have to say quite disappointed for fine dining.  service was good, just way to rush in sending out the courses.  had a tasting menu with wine pairing.  have to say price is not expensive, but food was not the best.  especially signature dishes as spaghetti and <mark>Spiced Duck Breast</mark>.  the spaghetti is like random home made tv dinner.  noodle was too thick.  <mark>Spiced Duck Breast</mark> is way over cooked.  expect a bit more from cosmopolitan fine dining.  for usd 250 per person, the package should be a bit better.", 
            "my family and i dined here in nov and ordered an array of dishes. i forgot our waiter's name but he was a tall slender gentleman w. a beautiful smile. his service was very memorable. he was knowledgeable w. the menu and i ordered one of his recommendations;\n\n<mark>Creamy Polenta</mark>: creamy and rich!\n\nsicilian-<mark>Spiced Duck Breast</mark> with preserved orange, root vegetables and caramelized endive. i was pleasantly surprised. \n\nduck & <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark>- rich rich rich and flavorful. \n\nmediterranean orata- very light and flavorful. the fish skin was crispy and the meat was moist.\n\nthe dinner was good but it was the desserts that made it great!\n\nthe st<mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> souffle and it was delish!! -i wish i could remember the name of the other desserts because they were all really out of this world too. \n\nthe dinner was ok but hats off to the pastry chef and our fantastic waiter!", 
            "i am a fan of scott conant from chopped fame but i have to say the las vegas outpost of his iconic nyc restaurant just did not live up to the hype.  i went with a group of guys and we ordered the tasting menu.  they were nice enough to allow us to order it on a friday night since it is usually not offered on that night of the week.  we tasted 8 dishes for $110 pp.  the quantity of food was great - really full at the end of the meal - but most of the dishes were just ok.\n\nthe real highlight for me was the <mark>Creamy Polenta</mark> with truffled mushrooms.  wow, that was delicious.  probably the creamiest polenta i've ever had and it paired so nicely with the earthiness of the truffles and mushrooms.   the <mark>Chocolate Cake</mark> served for the dessert course was also terrific, served with toasted almond gelato.  too bad i was so full by that time i could only have a couple of bites.  nothing else was particularly memorable.  \n\ndisappointing for me was the restaurant's signature spaghetti - a seemingly simple preparation of pasta, fresh tomatoes and basil.  it arrived very simply plated -  a perfect cylinder mold of spaghetti covered by a clear plastic cloche that i suppose is meant to preserve the freshness of the preparation or perhaps to concentrate the aroma.  the cloches are removed with a flourish releasing nice smells of tomato and basil.  the pasta was a bit overcooked and the sauce, while wonderfully creamy (how do they do that?) was just too sweet, as if chef conant and chef boyardee had a bastard love-child.\n\nanother disappointment was the <mark>Black Cod</mark>.  in the past i have found this fish to be among the most delicious owing to its high fat content and buttery texture and flavor.  scarpetta's rendition of this fish, pan-roasted with concentrated tomatoes and roasted fennel, was so overcooked that it was unrecognizable as <mark>Black Cod</mark>.  just a piece of fish.\n\nother dishes were a bit more successful including the <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> of <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> and tuna, the diver scallops, the short rib/<mark>Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti</mark> and the <mark>Spiced Duck Breast</mark>.\n\nthe wine list is voluminous and expensive.  the cocktail menu offers some nice selections.\n\nthere is certainly a lot of eye candy to be enjoyed at this swank place in the cosmo.  however, one annoying thing was the lighting.  over every table there is a large fixture containing multiple <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark>/gold colored lights.  this lighting casts the food in a weird color and makes taking pictures of the food impossible.  all the food looks bad in the pictures i took - i suppose that's no surprise that the pictures were a disappointment too.", 
            "food:\n<mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark>:  a mediocre sized dish, with oily ravioli stuffed with slim slivers of <mark>Spiced Duck Breast</mark> and foie gras. maybe foie gras is not meant to be cooked, but it was not a 5 star experience. despite my description it was good, but not great. i would expect more for what i am paying. \n\nbbq ribs and bone marrow pasta: another ok meal, with the small chunks of meat in them. \n\nseared scallop: very delicious. this was a wonderful appetizer, it set the par at which i was expecting the rest of the food to be at, unfortunately nothing did. very juicy, and the bacon wrapping it was just the right amount of crispy.\n\nservice:\ni hated the service, we had some snobby waiter that was quite rude. no help with description of food, not even a smile. i just didn't like him. our waters were refilled once. this is a fine dining restaurant, i expect my water to be filled each time i reach half way. for las vegas standards this place failed miserably. i sit at the far end of restaurant in bachi burger and my water gets filled constantly. any restaurant, fine dining or not, the people serve with a smile. the food runners were nice enough though. the service did not meet the standards one would expect at a restaurant like this.\n\nthe restaurant:\nwe had a pretty nice view of the bellagio water works. we were one table away from the window, but it was still nice. the decor was nice too, i liked the way set up, the tables seemed to be stacked higher and higher as they went away from the window. chandeliers were very fancy. the decor met vegas standards. \n\nall in all probably not going back, not worth the money.", 
            "excellent dining experience!!! our waiter was very knowledgable and attentive to our requests and needs! \nwe had fettuccine  with lamb ragu, broccoli rabe & pecorino to start with .... it was very good\n main course: prime filet <mark>Braised Short Ribs of Beef</mark> with potato-lardo pur\\u00e9e, rainbow chard & barolo sauce and <mark>Spiced Duck Breast</mark> with eggplant gratin, pine nuts & duck jus!\n both were very tasty and balanced in flavors!\nfor dessert we had  nutella & vanilla bomboloni (nutella ganache, banana gelato & chocolate shortbread)....... interesting ........ didn't impress me much as i was looking for more uniqueness !!!! it  reminded me of donut fi\n\nfor drinks we had:\nil dolce limone  and san remo!!!\n\nif you are looking for a romantic dinner with you loved one, this is a very good choice!!!!", 
            "i ate here last night and boyfriend and i decided on the tasting menu! it was about 6 different courses, each with amazing flavor. the bread basket and dippings that come with were so good i had to restrain myself from gobbling it all up too quickly. the cocktails were way better than expected too. i had the scarpetta cosmo since we were at the cosmo. :)\n\ni think our favorite course might have been the ravioli and spaghetti? no, wait, definitely the <mark>Creamy Polenta</mark>. get the polenta. and the starter of tuna and <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> was phenomenal. there was also cod served and <mark>Spiced Duck Breast</mark>, which were both perfectly cooked and seasoned, but i was getting so full at that point that i gave up midway through the duck. the ending dessert was a rich dark <mark>Chocolate Cake</mark> with gelato. they switched out the flavor of gelato for my boyfriend due to a nut allergy and were really accommodating. and they gave us some kind of pineapple cream in lava soup? that tasted like it came straight from hawaii and the man doesn't even like bits of fruit in his food but helped me eat all of this one.\n\neverything was perfect! we left more full than we expected off of a tasting menu! service was great and very informative.", 
            "the best part of the meal was the bread basket, it was seriously the best bread i've ever had. we had the polenta and short rib appetizers and both were amazing. the short rib and bone morrow agnolotti with a brown butter sauce was excellent as was the <mark>Spiced Duck Breast</mark>. the pici noodles were perfect and perfectly spiced. the flavors were wonderful. the prime filet <mark>Braised Short Ribs of Beef</mark> was ok. we were all stuffed but we had to have the bomboloni and <mark>Chocolate Cake</mark>, yum!"

            "scarpetta serves the best bread basket i have ever seen. and i don't say that lightly.\n\ni would've been happy with either the fluffy dinner rolls, the buttery, toasted focaccia, or the simple, crusty italian bread on their own. and any one of the citrus-infused olive oil, the eggplant caponata or the marscopone butter accompaniments would have been not only generous, but irresistibly delicious.\n\nsurprisingly, scarpetta lays every one of these items in front of you in a sumptuous, complimentary carby feast, along with the absolute kicker: stromboli. that's meaty, cheesey bread, people; it's a meal in itself, and a damn good one. \n\ni knew i shouldn't, but i couldn't help but stuff my face with the free delights. and although i was already full when they arrived, i forced myself to choke down the simple, perfect spaghetti, as well as a beautifully rare <mark>Prime Aged Sirloin</mark> in a barolo reduction.\n\ni might not have any friends and/or social skills, and later that evening, i may or may not have lost my pants* downstairs playing craps...but eating this flawless meal means i'm a winner anyway.\n__________\n\n*i think the bellagio is now in possession of my shirt. now i've got nothing.", 
            "so, i was in vegas for a fab race/scavenger hunt event, and met up with friends the night before the event at scarpetta for what i hoped would be an excellent meal.  it did not disappoint.\n\nthere were some nice-sounding appetizers on the menu, but we bypassed those in favor of ordering the day's pasta special as our starter.  it was linguini with truffle, and it was perfect.  possibly the best pasta i've ever eaten.  seriously, i wish i'd ordered that again as my meal.  and then maybe again as dessert.\n\ntable faves included the <mark>Prime Aged Sirloin</mark>, the orata rossa, the scallops and the sunchokes.  the roasted baby carrots were also pretty great.  the spaghetti was fine, but, honestly, after that starter, it just couldn't compete.  the gingerbread-pear crisp was the fave dessert, though all were good.\n\nthe fave wine of the night was the super tuscan, though it was crazy with sediment (something i'm surprised they didn't notice before serving it).", 
            "i have no intention to return to scarpetta after having dined there last night on the pre-fixe menu for restaurant week. first i will state what is warranting the one star: a wonderful chianti and delicious heirloom tomatoes. \n\nthis is what i was served:\n\nheirloom tomato salad - i thought the presentation was lovely and all the flavors were good and spread out. the heirloom tomatoes were very tasty. i was not disappointed with this dish.\n\n<mark>Prime Aged Sirloin</mark> beef; potato gnocchi, wild mushrooms, parmigiano & barolo ragu - i am fairly certain my dish did not have any mushrooms in it and i was very disappointed in this fact. was it because we were dining on the rw menu? i guess mushrooms only go to those paying full price? the sirloin was o.k.. nothing special. i will admit the waiter suggested i get it medium and i opted for medium-well, maybe my mistake here - but the fact the meat had quite a bit of fat on it and gristle was not my fault.\n\namadei <mark>Chocolate Cake</mark> toasted almond gelato & salted caramel sauce - the cake was very rich and i was pleased with it, however i felt as though it was something that could be served up at an applebee's for goodness sake, not a fine dining establishment.\n\non to the even worse (because the food was actually okay) was the service. our waiter was horrid. just absolutely, down-right inattentive and spaced out beyond belief. he was an older gentlemen. mistakes made:\n\n- incredibly slow service\n- offering us a wine menu, but not taking our wine order until we gave it to him ourselves\n- the wine took forever to arrive and in the mean time he did not return to take our meal orders\n- had tap water poured into our water cups that were filled with the water we paid for\n- he did a poor-ass job of describing the meals, as did the others serving us\n- just the most bland service ever; did not ask us how our food was, did not chat with us at all, just did not care in general\n\nwas it because we were there on the rw menu? maybe. and if that is the way an establishment runs a wonderful event for a good cause for a charity than i have absolutely no intention of ever returning to order off the menu. there are better places i can go in vegas to have fine italian dining. scarpetta is not one of them.", 
            "our server started us out with an array of different breads, accompanied by mascarpone butter, an eggplant tomato caponata & citrus olive oil. i often tend to judge a meal as soon as the bread (or chips... etc) arrives to the table. first impressions are crucial! if you ever dine at scarpetta, dig for the warm stromboli loaf in your bread basket first! it pairs really wonderfully with the caponata, but also stands strong on its own. you definitely want to eat this bread while its hot- because its stuffed with layers of salami & mozzarella. yum!\n\nmy first course was <mark>Braised Short Ribs of Beef</mark> over a farro risotto. the beef was immensely tender & alive with flavor. it had a very thin slice of parmesan resting on top of it, just barely melted. nice touch! i loved how hearty the risotto was- this is nothing my mom would have ever prepared for me...but somehow the risotto tasted home-y. i didn't even have time to identify all the vegetables that were in this dish, because i was far too busy stuffing my face. between bites of the short ribs, i had a few pieces of <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark>. incredibly fresh, with such great flavor. unknown to me at the time, it was adorn with almost microscopic red onions (gross)...but i ate each piece very willingly- despite my hatred for onions.\n\nfor my main course i had the <mark>Prime Aged Sirloin</mark> <mark>Braised Short Ribs of Beef</mark>. it was served with wild mushrooms, potato gnocchi & barolo ragu. everything on the plate was exceedingly juicy & robust, without being overwhelming. the gnocchi was a great equalizer to the sirloin and the ragu. this dish was really unforgettable, hats off to scott conant.\n\ndessert was very simple! <mark>Coconut Panna Cotta</mark> served with coconut sorbetto, pineapples & guava soup, ofcourse this is my pick- being a true hawaiian & all. i could have done without the crushed pineapples, i felt like they interfered with the guava coconut vibe i had going. i had mentally prepared myself for the guava soup to be too sweet, but fortunately, i was incorrect. in addition to that, i was thrilled with how smooth the <mark>Coconut Panna Cotta</mark> was. each bite was like silk!\n\nin short, i loved scarpetta. 4 stars!", 
            "restaurant week 2011. the wife and i only planned on going out only once for restaurant week, but after perusing all the menus we were persuaded to try one more place -- scarpetta at the cosmopolitan. we were seated at a two-top by the window overlooking the bellagio fountains. one of the better views in town, it makes for a great spot for a romantic night out. the clean lines and modern motif of the restaurant interior add to the upscale and elegant atmosphere.\n\nscarpetta might have one of the best bread baskets around, but that can solely be attributed to the stromboli found within. warm, chewy and delicious, it's almost a meal itself. the focaccia isn't bad either.\n\nthe first two dishes were <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> and polenta. the <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> consisted of four slices of fish topped with olio di zenzero, pickled red onions and microgreens. a couple slices were bland and under seasoned, while others were perfect. the other app ordered came on the recommendation of our waiter. and, i'm glad i listened to him. the <mark>Creamy Polenta</mark> came in a decent sized bowl along with a pot with truffled mushrooms fricassee, which the server promptly spooned into the polenta. the rich and savory dish was unlike any polenta i've had before. \n\nthe <mark>Prime Aged Sirloin</mark> beef entree came sliced, cooked medium rare as ordered and was accompanied by a few light and fluffy potato gnocchi, wild mushrooms, barolo ragu, and topped with paper thin slices of parmigiano. the sirloin was good, but not nearly as good as the other entree.\n\nthe <mark>Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti</mark> didn't look like much when it was placed on the table -- a shallow bowl filled with a modest amount of small stuffed pasta. but, the flavor from each bite was amazing. each piece was a thin, delicate piece of pasta stuffed with tender short rib, with an intensely rich sauce. i loved the added texture that the bread crumbs added. it was a great dish on every level.\n\ndesserts were tasty, as well. amadei <mark>Chocolate Cake</mark> with toasted almond gelato and salted caramel sauce was dense and moist. the <mark>Coconut Panna Cotta</mark> with coconut sorbetto, guava soup and pineapple was surprisingly light, creamy, and not too filling. it was a beautiful presentation with the guava soup covering and contrasting the <mark>Coconut Panna Cotta</mark> below.\n\nour service was a perfect compliment to our meal. luis timed everything perfectly and provided the kind of personalized, friendly service that every top-notch restaurant should have.\n\ni've had plenty of underwhelming experiences over the years for restaurant week, but this was definitely one of the best. i'm already thinking about when i'll be able to come back and hopefully enjoy more great food and service.", 
            "we went here for one of our dinners in vegas this weekend. we were able to get a good reservation on a short notice, and were seated near the window overlooking the bellagio fountain so that was a nice touch.\n\nserver was extremely knowlegable and even shared some additional knowledge he had about the sommelier. turns out he is one of four master sommelier's in las vegas, and has his own vineyard. nice guy to chat with.\n\nnow the food... we started with the <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark>, moved on to the black farfalle, and ended with the <mark>Prime Aged Sirloin</mark>. <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> was awesome, though could have been sliced a little thicker. if you have never had black farfalle, i suggest getting it here. the server mentioned it would have a shelfish taste, but i didn't find it to be overwhelming, instead a nice balance. the <mark>Prime Aged Sirloin</mark> came with perfectly prepared gnocchi, which is a hard task seemingly for many chefs to pull off. but they did tonight! the barolo ragu was a perfect addition to bring the dish altogether.\n\nthe only thing i would say is the wine list was a tad overpriced in comparison to what i would expect from retail / dining out. so that is what made the 4th star come out. \n\ndefinitely a great dining experience.", 
            "i've been to scarpetta lv 3 times so far. great bread basket, \"more stromboli please!\" recommend the spaghetti. which is strange because i never order spaghetti when dining out, this ones special though. <mark>Black Tagliolini</mark> was delicious and some pasta filled with short ribs, i forget the name of it but it's different and probably isn't like anything you've had before. order and share the dry <mark>Prime Aged Sirloin</mark> to accompany your pasta. it's a perfect fit, especially with the spaghetti.\n\ndessert? skip it. had em all and not one i would order again, and by this point you'll have spent enough money.  thought about giving scarpetta 3 stars, not because of food but because of price, e.g. \"the handmade in house pasta\" spaghetti is $24. but i had to take into consideration of the convenience of being located on the strip and that location with it's great fountain views cost money.", 
            "very attentive staff, gorgeous decor (albeit a bit dark), quality food:\n\nbraised short ribs with spring vegetables and farro rissoto: fall-off the bone tender, perfectly seasoned, and i enjoyed the twist on the rissoto\n\nroasted sea scallops: cooked to perfection, not too briny or rubbery, to go very well with the white truffle asparagus, not too overwhelmed by the rich truffle oil.\n\nduck and <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark>: delicious, but too decadent for my taste. they give you a huge portion, too, about 3 times the amount i actually was expecting, even for an entree. filling, with a good salty bite. finishing this was the death of me, but a very enjoyable self-indulgent death.\n\nspaghetti: i love when simple, basic dishes are just beautifully executed. this was just the perfect spaghetti. i would be perfectly okay walking into a restaurant like this and ordering it. it is divine.\n\nmediterranean branzino: seafood party in my mouth. branzino had a nice caramelized crust and the medley of vegetables and shrimp/clams/etc paired really well with the light broth.\n\n<mark>Prime Aged Sirloin</mark> <mark>Braised Short Ribs of Beef</mark>: cooked to bloody medium-rare excellence. enjoyed the salty/nutty bite of parmagiano.\n\nas for cocktails, i can recommend the gimlet and the gallardo.", 
            "let me start by saying that i've eaten at some pretty incredible places in vegas, spent a lot more money than i did here, but i absolutely enjoyed myself at scarpetta just as much at a fraction of the cost. everything was spot-on for our visit. despite having made last-minute reservations, we requested and received a booth where all four of us could see the fountains. the appetizers were amazing: we tried the <mark>Chilled Pea Soup</mark>, polenta, scallops, and short ribs. for entrees, two of us had the duck and <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark>, which i will be dreaming about for a long time; the <mark>Prime Aged Sirloin</mark>; and the spaghetti. one of us had dessert (yeah, that would be me), a <mark>Coconut Panna Cotta</mark> in a guava soup. perfect. my only complaint: the wine prices. they are, in a word, astronomical. i expect to pay double retail prices usually, maybe a bit more in vegas, but scarpetta is at least quadruple. so my husband chose beer, and i went with two glasses of wine and called it a day, rather than having to sell myself on the strip for a bottle.", 
            "love this place!  went her for my girlfriend's birthday and was delicious!  i had their <mark>Prime Aged Sirloin</mark> <mark>Braised Short Ribs of Beef</mark> rare as possible for $36 and the spaghetti tomatoes with basil is to die for here.  service and atmosphere was perfect.\n\ncan't want to go here again. =d",

            "i must admit, my expectations were somewhat low for scarpetta, as i usually find the las vegas outposts of famous restaurants to be more about decor and overpriced menus, and less about food.  i was glad to be proven wrong.\n\nalthough scarpetta definitely delivers in the \"las vegas hip\" decor, with a gorgeous dining room that has a glass-enclosed wine cellar on one wall, and floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking the bellagio fountains on the other, it also delivers on the food front.\n\nat the waiters recommendation, my group of three decided to share a primi (app) and pasta, and order our own entrees.  before our first course came out, we were brought fresh bread basket which i can honestly say was the best bread i've ever had.  a mix of rosemary ciabatta, focaccia, and this to-die-for bread that had salami and mozzarella in it.  the accompaniments of olive oil, eggplant spread, and mascarpone butter were equally satisfying.  here is a by-dish review:\n\nheirloom tomato salad w/ stracciatella, salsa verde & marinated eggplant:  this dish was good, if not a bit common.  it seems so many restaurants have an heirloom tomtato & burrata dish, that if you've had one, you've had them all - although i was happy to learn that stracciatella is an equally awesome burrata-style cheese.\n\n<mark>Creamy Polenta</mark> w/ fricassee of truffled mushrooms: hands down the best polenta anyone at our table had ever had.  it was so creamy and rich, and went great with the mushrooms which were served from a separate pot.\n\nduck & <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark> w/ marsala reduction:  this dish was very well received by the two people in my party who'd never had foie gras.  i am a huge fan of foie, and found the dish to be lacking the richness that usually comes when it's served on it's own - but overall a great dish.\n\npancetta-wrapped <mark>Veal Loin</mark> w/ sweetbreads, peas & carrots: the <mark>Veal Loin</mark> was my favorite dish of the night.  i am used to having sweetbreads battered and fried, so it was interesting to have them in a more natural state - small chunks cooked and mixed in with the vegetables.\n\nzeppole w/ nutella center, vanilla sauce & candied hazelnuts: wow - we were blown away by how good this dessert was.  little chocolate donut holes filled with nutella - yum.\n\ni will say that their wine list leans towards the expensive side, with only a few bottles in the $60 - $70 range.  we ordered the castello di bossi chianti classcio riserva berardo, which was $105 (retails for $30) - a good wine, but a bit pricey.", 
            "cutting edge italian food presented beautifully in the perfect contemporary setting of the cosmo.  \n\nscarpetta's food is about building and layering flavors from a few ingredients to produce a harmonious dish.\n\nfor starters, <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> best.  the tuna \"scusci\" is excellent.  the tartness of the marinated veg pairs perfectly with the fish.  the <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> dish, with its pure simplicity brings out all the subtle sweetness of the fish.  finally the wagyu tartare.  wow, the use of the hazelnuts and parmigianino cheese creates a totally unexpected flavor!  \n\nfor pasta, its gotta be the duck and <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark>.  other <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> said they loved it.  it really is good.  the pasta is perfectly cooked and works well with the sweetness of the marsala reduction.\n\ntop mains include the branzino with pine nuts and green garlic gremolata that totally brings out the naturally nutty flavor of the fish and the pancetta wrapped <mark>Veal Loin</mark>, served with sweetbreads.  the flavors are very subtle and absolutely delicious.\n\nthe wine list is very good with a nice balance of italian wines (not just super tuscans).  vintage depth is ok.  prices are in line with vegas resorts.\n\nservice is very efficient.\n\noverall prices are very good for a restaurant of this caliber.\n\nrecommended.", 
            "my husband and i recently celebrated our anniversary at scarpetta and were seated by the window overlooking the bellagio fountains. very romantic. \n\nas much as i tried to save room for the main meal, the bread basket with an assortment of carbs along with mascarpone butter, roasted eggplant spread, and lemon infused olive oil was too hard to resist.  i even asked for a refill of the rosemary focaccia, it was that good. \n\nwe ordered the following:\nappetizer: \n*roasted sea scallops- 2 perfectly cooked giant scallops that melt in your mouth. \n\npasta: \n*duck and fois <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark> in a marsala reduction\n*spaghetti with tomato and basil\nboth dishes were fabulous and i highly recommend both.  i would easily order either dish upon my return visit. \n\nmeat:\n*pancetta-wrapped <mark>Veal Loin</mark>- with sweetbreads and vegetables\n*halibut with vegetable puree\nagain, both were delicious but if i were to come again, i would definitely order the halibut over the <mark>Veal Loin</mark>.\n\ndessert:\n*napoleon- creme brulee, macadamia tuilles, blood orange sorbet\n*<mark>Chocolate Cake</mark> with toasted almond gelato and salted caramel sauce\nboth were decadent, but i personally preferred the <mark>Chocolate Cake</mark> more mainly because the salted caramel sauce was divine.  if i could order just a bowl of salted caramel sauce, i would in a heartbeat. \n\nwhen you dine here, you will not be disappointed.  the servers are attentive and friendly.  the food is excellently prepared. i can't wait to come back and try other items.", 
            "it's a fancy italian style restaurant at the cosmo. of course, the service is phenomenal and the food was pretty good as well. the bread was delicious, especially the one with the salami in it. all the fixings that come with the bread was really good too. \n\nwe got the <mark>Creamy Polenta</mark>, which was kind of like a mashed corn (i think), but it kinda had a mashed potato texture. the truffle mushrooms made it really delicious. we also got the <mark>Veal Loin</mark>, which was really good. it was tender and not at all gamey tasting. it was very well seasoned and tasted delicious, especially since it was my first time having veal. i got the stracci, which was pasta with lobster, crab, and shrimp on top. if you're a seafood lover, then you'll love this.", 
            "had a wonderful meal here. the scallops appetizer was excellent thanks to the squash bed and accessory toppings. the <mark>Veal Loin</mark> was about as perfect as humanly possible. the nutella bombs were a nice sweet finish. all was helped by a polished professional waiter.", 
            "i took my wife here for her 40th birthday and they knew we were coming and the reason. \n\nthis was our first time here. we arrived minutes after 9pm.\n\nthe restaurant was dimly lit. the atmosphere was loud. nothing romantic about this setting at all. \n\nhostess\n\nher greeting was like listening to an answering machine. we had a 9:30 reservation (90 min before closing) and got sat in front of a pillar. i could not see the bellagio fountains that seems to influence everybody's reviews. about 20 min later, 2 tables opened up that were right against the glass. in my reservation i let them know it was a special occasion. \n\nserver\n\nlike the hostess, it was like watching blue man group after 3 straight performances. \n\njust going through the motions. \n\nwe were not interested in cocktails or wine, but were focused on some great cuisine. the server did stop once to go over the menu, but all he did was say \"these are the apps, these are the pastas, these are the main courses\" etc. etc. they must get a lot of people who never viewed a menu before. \n\nwe ordered the misto fritto, farmers salad, fennel <mark>Black Cod</mark>, and wrapped <mark>Veal Loin</mark>. (i did not take any pictures this time, i did not want my review to be a distraction of the occasion) \n\nfood\n\nmy wife loved the complimentary bread which included dippers of olive oil, roasted eggplant and tomatoes, and truffle butter. the bread was varieties of an italian sourdough, foccacia, stromboli, and a vegetable stromboli. \n\nthey automatically split our app & salad which i appreciated. \n\nmisto fritto\n\nthe menu description was very vague, but i figured it had to be a spin off of fried calamari. tempura battered squid, white anchovies, cauliflower, and the stems of chives. there were no anchovies in my plate, and happened to be my wife's first bite on her's which she did not like at all. i would not have known about the anchovies (which i love) if i did not finish her plate. the fry was perfect, and i really liked the seasoning which included rosemary. \n\nfarmers salad\n\nthe presentation was beautiful. some of the vegetables (green & <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> squash) were almost shaved. it was a nice salad, but not much flavor. there were only 2 choices of salad on the menu and i chose this one. my wife ate only half of hers. \n\n<mark>Veal Loin</mark>\n\nthere is a picture of this dish in the archives. 3 (2oz?) wrapped pieces of veal perfectly cooked. a few pieces of carrots and another vegetable. i tasted some sort of mustard on this dish with another sauce. the menu (again) was very vague. as i ate, i was wondering what the expense was in making this dish that carried a $38 price. \n\n\n<mark>Black Cod</mark>\n\npresentation was standard, looked to be about a 5oz filet. my wife was half way through her dish without a sound. knowing my wife, this means she did not want to disappoint me in saying she did not care for it. i tried a bite and thought it was weird for cod to be so mushy. it was not pleasant at all. maybe even undercooked. \nmy wife at all the vegetables and there was half of the filet sitting alone on the plate when the busser took it away. sad that no one noticed that half of what was supposed to be the hero of this dish was being tossed out like a used tissue. \n\nwe passed on dessert because to me, dessert should be the perfect finish to a perfect meal which this whole experience was not. my wife liked the complimentary bread the best and i liked the <mark>Crispy Fritto Misto</mark> the best. there was some woman in a very loud group making noises that reminded me of farm animals in heat. \n\nit shouldn't be this way in a restaurant of this price point.   \n\ni asked for the check (1app, 1 salad, 2 entrees) $116.00 \n\nas we were getting up to leave, a person came by with a dish that said happy birthday and had 2 biscotti\"s , a cookie, a salted chocolate thingy and a lit candle.\n\nwould have went better with a cappuccino but the check was already paid. \n\nthis was a disappointing experience, even more so because i wanted it to be special for my wife's 40th. she liked the complimentary bread.....\n\nif i can say something positive and relative, i would recommend going to d.o.c g. instead. same chef, different menu. been there 5 times and loved it.", 
            "the boys and i had a very good, relaxing meal here last friday night.  very nice restaurant in cosmo restaurant row. place is classy but not the least bit stuffy. like everyone mentions, the bread selection is great. mini stromboli's w/ sides of marscapone, tomato/garlic...really good. went through several of the pasta dishes for the table to begin. duck and foi <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark>, risotto w/ short rib and short rib and bone marrow angolotti all good to excellent. nothing better than home made pasta. polenta w/ truffled mushrooms might have been even better that the pasta dishes...must try! i had the <mark>Veal Loin</mark> and pork belly. the loin was a bit dry, but flavorful..the pork belly was spectacular.  friends had steak and halibut, all were very happy. wine list is amazing..tons of italian wines...pricey! found a good bottle for around $100.  overall, pretty reasonably priced meal for vegas.  good stuff scott!"

            "restaurant week 2011. the wife and i only planned on going out only once for restaurant week, but after perusing all the menus we were persuaded to try one more place -- scarpetta at the cosmopolitan. we were seated at a two-top by the window overlooking the bellagio fountains. one of the better views in town, it makes for a great spot for a romantic night out. the clean lines and modern motif of the restaurant interior add to the upscale and elegant atmosphere.\n\nscarpetta might have one of the best bread baskets around, but that can solely be attributed to the stromboli found within. warm, chewy and delicious, it's almost a meal itself. the focaccia isn't bad either.\n\nthe first two dishes were <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> and polenta. the <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> consisted of four slices of fish topped with olio di zenzero, pickled red onions and microgreens. a couple slices were bland and under seasoned, while others were perfect. the other app ordered came on the recommendation of our waiter. and, i'm glad i listened to him. the <mark>Creamy Polenta</mark> came in a decent sized bowl along with a pot with truffled mushrooms fricassee, which the server promptly spooned into the polenta. the rich and savory dish was unlike any polenta i've had before. \n\nthe <mark>Prime Aged Sirloin</mark> beef entree came sliced, cooked medium rare as ordered and was accompanied by a few light and fluffy potato gnocchi, wild mushrooms, barolo ragu, and topped with paper thin slices of parmigiano. the sirloin was good, but not nearly as good as the other entree.\n\nthe <mark>Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti</mark> didn't look like much when it was placed on the table -- a shallow bowl filled with a modest amount of small stuffed pasta. but, the flavor from each bite was amazing. each piece was a thin, delicate piece of pasta stuffed with tender short rib, with an intensely rich sauce. i loved the added texture that the bread crumbs added. it was a great dish on every level.\n\ndesserts were tasty, as well. amadei <mark>Chocolate Cake</mark> with toasted almond gelato and salted caramel sauce was dense and moist. the <mark>Coconut Panna Cotta</mark> with coconut sorbetto, guava soup and pineapple was surprisingly light, creamy, and not too filling. it was a beautiful presentation with the guava soup covering and contrasting the <mark>Coconut Panna Cotta</mark> below.\n\nour service was a perfect compliment to our meal. luis timed everything perfectly and provided the kind of personalized, friendly service that every top-notch restaurant should have.\n\ni've had plenty of underwhelming experiences over the years for restaurant week, but this was definitely one of the best. i'm already thinking about when i'll be able to come back and hopefully enjoy more great food and service.",

            "a-ok is what scarpetta was. i was very excited to finally taste the famous pasta from the man himself-scott conant. i have been watching chopped for weeks and was curious what exactly does he think amazing pasta is. well scott maybe pasta is the only thing you should stick to.\n\nwe have ordered the hamachi, tuna, polenta, <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark>, <mark>Black Cod</mark> and the tasting menu.\n\nlet's start from the beginning. first of all i would like to say that the service was beyond reparable. we sat at the restaurant for almost 3 hours. it took the server to give us the menu for about half an hour and every time we looked for him he wasn't there. after hinting and hinting that we would like our food right away the longer it took to the point where we just left.\n\nhere is the breakdown:\n\nhamachi: nothing special-nobu beats this dish any day of the week.\n\n<mark>Tuna susci</mark>: if you think wrapping tuna over a bunch of carrots is creative-think again.\n\npolenta: i really enjoyed this dish. it came in a small pot with a mushroom sauce on the side. this was one of my favorite appetizers.\n\n<mark>Black Cod</mark>: it was a-ok. i wish it had more flavor and was more moist. i guess beggars can't be choosers. \n\nduck and <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark>: the dough was chewy and hard. the sauce on top ruined the whole dish in my opinion. the inside was tender and rich. i think if the ravioli were smaller and more tender it would come together better.\n\ntasting menu:\n\n<mark>Crispy Fritto Misto</mark>: a-ok. i like anchovies but i don't think this dish brought anything special to the table.\n\nspaghetti with tomato and basil was the best dish of the night! it was tender, flavorful and tasty. i would have this again any day!\n\ndessert: the <mark>Chocolate Cake</mark> was dry and even with the gelato on the side it still left a bitter rough flavor in my mouth!\n\nwe tried a few other things which i don't even care to discuss on the tasting menu\n\nthe bread basket was also pretty amazing! it came with 3 sauces which we ordered a second round of!\n\noverall i am not impressed by this italian restaurant. this has nothing to do with price or the atmosphere. i think as a food critic what you look at is the freshness of the food and the service. i have seen a lot of bad service but ignoring your patrons will not bring you very far.\n\nso scott conant i am giving you a c+. you have been chopped!", 
            "the final meal of our vegas escapade was well spent at scarpetta. it wasn't completely perfect but most of the night made up for the little missteps (we'll get to that later) so for the most part, i had nothing but a good time. attentive service, rich indulgent food, all housed within an intimate space with gorgeous views of the ballagio fountains, we closed our trip in pure hedonistic style.\n\nwe started with some of their signature cocktails as we browsed the menu. upon the recommendation from our fantastic server, and the joys of libation, we decided on the tasting menu ($99) and accompanying wine pairing ($49) since several of the dishes that we wanted to try were on it anyway and boy did we pick right. that was the beginning of six courses of pure pleasure.\n\nwe started with a sashimi plate (http://www.<mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark>.com/biz_photos/0nmtwqyeqikerdv4a55obg?select=yvhgcff5cqsiopyc83uwwa) which consisted of <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> with a drizzle of ginger oil and red onions. the other half of the plate sat the <mark>Tuna susci</mark> - tuna wrapped marinated vegetables. the fish was so fresh and the flavors were delicately balanced. the bread basket came shortly after and there was a nice selection including yummy foccacia and stromboli. as part of the tasting menu, the chef also threw in a couple of surprises and we were treated to a delightful seafood <mark>Crispy Fritto Misto</mark> for this course. perfectly crispy fried but not oily, every bite was yummy and the rock shrimp just melted in my mouth.  \n\nthe next course was a perfectly roasted sea scallop. (http://www.<mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark>.com/biz_photos/0nmtwqyeqikerdv4a55obg?select=06qyvnxbie8hftnykn4obw) it was a joy to eat and the velvety salmoriglio sauce was a nice accompaniment to the sweet and juicy scallop. the chef's extra this course was a polenta with a truffle mushroom stew. (http://www.<mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark>.com/biz_photos/0nmtwqyeqikerdv4a55obg?select=gtrwgpr4xgghmw0rvryanw) for the record i hate cornmeal and thus hate grits, tamales, and polenta. yet, i could not stop eating this polenta. the flavors of the mushroom stew combine with the impeccably smooth polenta. (i suspect there's a whole lot more butter in it than what chef scott conant lets on) it was a nice double headliner with the scallop. \n\nnext up was the pasta course and chef conant's signature tomato & basil spaghetti. (http://www.<mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark>.com/biz_photos/0nmtwqyeqikerdv4a55obg?select=jqrljq4g8bgizxs0bc8bow) fresh made pasta in a simple tomato basil (+ quarter stick of butter) sauce but just perfectly executed. while i thoroughly enjoyed it, the chef's extra this course, the <mark>Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti</mark> with brown butter horseradish & toasted breadcrumb (http://www.<mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark>.com/biz_photos/0nmtwqyeqikerdv4a55obg?select=wzfcolektvylois628h_ag), totally blew my mind. wow who would have thought that the combination of short ribs, horseradish, and toasted breadcrumbs could be so sublime? i miss it already as i speak. \n\nthe next course was the <mark>Black Cod</mark>. (http://www.<mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark>.com/biz_photos/0nmtwqyeqikerdv4a55obg?select=2tmoceavt5t4aeu8j6itra) again perfectly seared but wonderfully moist in the middle. the fatty fish absolutely stands out against the sauce and caramelized fennel. delicious. the next entree course was a the <mark>Spiced Duck Breast</mark>. (http://www.<mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark>.com/biz_photos/0nmtwqyeqikerdv4a55obg?select=br1frh72uravjtrhiq6w-a) while this was my least favorite dish of the night, it was still absolutely delicious which tells you the quality of the food all night. the orange and spices (i kept picking up 5 spice) worked well with gamy duck. all in all, a successful combination. \n\nfinal course and dessert was a <mark>Chocolate Cake</mark> with toasted almond gelato and caramel. (http://www.<mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark>.com/biz_photos/0nmtwqyeqikerdv4a55obg?select=udi5apzqgqwuqcgjvukosg) this is where i really had to throw in the towel after all that eating. the <mark>Chocolate Cake</mark> was really rich and decadent and i could only finish half of it but i just couldn't let the toasted almond gelato go to waste. it was just delicious. you can totally taste the toasted flavor. \n\nnow on to the kink of the night. since we were seated by the wine cellar, the sommelier came by several times to retrieve bottles of wine. each single time, he let the door hit me as i was eating without even acknowledging it, much less apologize. not that it was a deal breaker but you expect a little more basic courtesy especially when you're dropping good money on dinner. \n\nstill for a wonderfully decadent meal paired with friendly and attentive service, we had a good time and i strongly recommend scarpetta if you want to treat yourself to a fine meal on the strip.", 
            "the bread basket alone would bring me back! that stromboli is amazing! i love salami and bread, so put the two together.....fuggetaboutit!\n\nwe had the tasting menu: \n\n- duo of <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> and tuna \"susci\": melt in your mouth delicious!\n\n- roasted sea scallops, cauliflower, bottarga, chili and caper salmoriglio: sea scallops can be rubbery and chewy if not cooked properly, but at scarpetta, they were cooked to perfection. they had the consistency of flaky, firm fish and the roasted cauliflower was a perfect pairing.\n\n- spagetti tomato basil - simple and good, but not memorable.\n\n- <mark>Black Cod</mark>, caramelized fennel & concentrated tomatoes - the fish was nice and flakey and the tomatoes added a nice acidity to the fish. i'm not a fan of fennel as they are too \"licorice-y\" in flavor for my taste.\n\n- <mark>Spiced Duck Breast</mark>, endive, preserved orange and cippollini - delicious! i love duck, but i hate when its not cooked properly or tastes overly fatty. this was a perfect balance. the preserved orange cut through the richness of the duck. yum!\n\n- amedei <mark>Chocolate Cake</mark> & toasted almond gelato - toasted almond gelato & salted caramel sauce. self explanatory....it was heaven!\n\nwhat made this experience special was that the chef brought out a few mini appetizers with every dish served, so it was like having an \"extended\" tasting menu. he brought out:\n\n- <mark>Crispy Fritto Misto</mark> - seafood, vegetables, artichokes, herbs & lemon\n- <mark>Creamy Polenta</mark> - fricassee of truffled mushrooms: by far my favorite dish at scarpetta. upon first glance, it looks like it would be too heavy and rich, but it was amazing!\n- <mark>Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti</mark> - brown butter horseradish & toasted breadcrumb.\n- zeppole - nutella center, vanilla sauce and candied hazelnuts. need i say more?\n\ni loved the ambiance and service of this restaurant. we were seated by the window facing the fountains of bellagio. a beautiful place to take someone on a date!", 
            "excellent restaurant.  rounding my 4.5 stars up to 5.\n\nsexy ambiance.  lovely, low lighting and a fabulous view of the bellagio fountains and the strip.  \n\nabsolutely beautiful service.  our server and every runner and busser were friendly and classy.  attentive but completely unobtrusive.  perfect.\n\nthe delicious meal started with their bread basket.  all of the breads and accompaniments (mascarpone butter, citrus olive oil and caponata) were great, especially the stromboli.  that was certainly a nice surprise!\n\nwe started with the <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> which was well-seasoned.  i loved the little crystals of flavored salt.    my guy had the stracci, a wide, flat pasta served with seafood.  very delicious and simple.  i had the foie and <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark> which was pretty amazing.  both dishes were very light on sauce, which i enjoyed.\n\nthe desserts were very good as well.  man-friend had the <mark>Chocolate Cake</mark> with almond gelato.  very tasty.  my mocha cheesecake was absolutely delicious.\n\ngreat restaurant for a sexy date.", 
            "the wife and i were in vegas on vacation and her younger cousin and his gf were in town the same week so we wanted to take them out to a nice dinner.  i didn't have a chance to check out scarpetta when i was last here in november, so this seemed like a perfect time.  \n\nthe room is absolutely beautiful, and we were lucky enough to get seated near a window, so we could also watch the bellagio fountain show at the same time.  i was thinking, this night is going to be perfect right......maybe not.  so the server comes to take our drink order.  i'm a simple guy, so i just ordered a miller lite.......he kind of looks at me and is like \" bud \".  i'm like ok, nevermind.  can i get a stella instead?  he's like yup.  i'm like.... ok.  then he leaves and the busser brings over the bread basket full of win~!  the bread was a salami roll, as well as some focaccia, and what looked like some french baguette.  the busser really explained the different condiments they had for the bread well.  he had a thick accent, so it was a little difficult to understand, but he did a nice job explaining it.  he left and our server came back with the beer....a bud.  i'm like...seriously, i just told you  stella?  then my wife's cousin asks him a bit about the condiments (mascarpone, some eggplant tapenade, and some olive oil) and if there is a certain one that is recommended for the different breads.   he's like i don't know, they're all good.  i'm like....seriously?  then we get around to ordering our apps and entrees.  we started with the braised shortribs and the <mark>Crispy Fritto Misto</mark>.....both were great.  the shortribs were very tender and flavorful.  the <mark>Crispy Fritto Misto</mark>,was crunchy and not oily either.  we then ordered our entrees. my wife and her cousin ordered the <mark>Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti</mark>, the cousins gf ordered the lamb loin.  haha, we could already tell how our waiter was, so for fun, she asked him how the lamb was.  you would think at a nicer upscale restaurant like this, he would boast about the preparation, or the sauce, or how tender the meat was......nope.  when she asked how it was, he said \"good.\"  really?  i thought restaurants made money by putting crap on the menu?  anyways, back to lucky old me.  i asked the waiter about the spaghetti with basil (which is what lots of people rave about) or the stracci.  he was like it's ok, but it's kind of plain.  not sure if he was trying to upsell me, but i don't know if scott conant would appreciate one of his servers calling his food plain.  anyways, i took his advice and order the stracci.  or did i?  because even if i ordered the stracci, that's not what was placed in front of me when the rest of the order came around.  i looked at the guy and was like \"didn't i tell you stracci?\"  oh, i'm not sure, let me check.  seriously?  what the hell, can this really be happening.  anyways, i waited patiently like a fool, while everybody else ate.  to scarpetta's defense, all the entrees were really good and flavorful, just the guy serving us needed a clue.  we moved on to dessert and ordered the <mark>Chocolate Cake</mark> (a bit too heavy for me), the <mark>Coconut Panna Cotta</mark> (awesome!), and the cheesecake (light, airy, completely delicious).  the waiter comped us an order of zeppole's for his lack of service, and it too was great.  \n\noverall, i was just disappointed that the service was so poor.  i was really looking forward to having a wonderful night with family and friends, but it ended up just being ok.  too bad", 
            "the boyfriend has been pining for this restaurant after hearing about their amazing spaghetti. also, after finding out that the man behind the restaurant is a judge from the food network's chopped, i was sold.\n\nthe food did not disappoint. we had the <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> tail as an appetizer, then the famed spaghetti and the sirloin. we decided we were going to share everything and the kitchen was actually nice enough to split each dish so that it was presented on two separate plates to us. each plate looked exactly as it would if it were the full portion. to top that off, they didn't even charge a splitting fee like so many restaurants usually would! that is what i call spectacular service. \n\ni'm a sucker for bread and their bread basket had me half full before we even ordered! the bread filled with salami and cheese was the favorite. it came with 3 dipping sauces, a marscapone cheese, tomato with eggplant, and a citrus oil. i thought the best combination was the citrus oil with the tomato and eggplant. \n\nthe <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> tail was fresh and had a nice chili kick to it. there were small chunks of rock salt that added a little crunch. it came with 4 slices of <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> tail, which was actually more than we expected.\n\nthe spaghetti lives up to its reputation. it was beautifully presented, swirled up into a pile and they uncover the plate right in front of you. the sauce is perfectly seasoned and the tomatoes still have a slight acidity. the pasta itself is cooked al dente and they're beautifully thick spaghetti noodles. i had to eat this one noodle at a time so i could make it last as long as possible. \n\nthe sirloin was cooked to our liking, but it was a bit chewy. we both loved the vegetables that came underneath it. there were carrots, mushrooms, potatoes, and probably some others and they were all so good!\n\nat the last minute, we decided to get the amedei <mark>Chocolate Cake</mark> with the almond gelato and salted caramel sauce. the gelato was my favorite part of the plate, although it looked partly melted by the time it got to the table. the <mark>Chocolate Cake</mark> was like a lava cake, where the middle is still fudge like. it could have been warmer. i thought the plate could use more of the gelato and almond gelato to balance out how rich the chocolate is. also, the bf ordered a coffee and it came with refills! \n\none complaint is that we were seated along the wine fridge and someone would come by every once in a while and just open it up behind us. having the chilled refrigerator air interrupt a nice meal isn't the most fun. but if you are seated by the window, there is an amazing view of the bellagio fountains.\n\nfor the price, it was actually a good amount of food and it is quality food. i really cannot wait for the spaghetti again. when i eat my jarred preggo tomato sauce, i'll be fantasizing about the spaghetti here.", 
            "this place is wonderful!! great service, ambiance and delicious food.\n\ni was originally a bit turned off by the poor service of the hostess taking our reservation over the phone, but once we arrived the staff (especially our waiter, mike) was very friendly and accommodating. we loved the ambiance: dim lighting, candles on the tables and stylish decor. we requested a table with a view of the bellagio fountains. it was really nice being able to look out from time to time even though there's a big bar on the window right at eye-level that makes it difficult to watch the fountain show without needing it lean over awkwardly.\n\nfood: overall, we really enjoyed our meal! though there were a couple items i'd recommend against, we loved most of the dishes we tried. here's a quick review of each item we ordered:\n\nappetizers\n\n- beet salad: i enjoyed this, but it was my least favorite of the apps we ordered and could have used more beets.\n\n- roasted sea scallops: if you like seafood, this dish is a must! so good. it was my favorite item we ordered, and my mouth is watering just thinking about it.\n\n- <mark>Creamy Polenta</mark>: another amazing dish! creamy, buttery perfection.\n\nentrees\n\n- spaghetti: my boyfriend loved this! he said it was the best spaghetti he's had here in the states. the noodles and sauce reminded him of spaghetti in venice, italy. :-)\n\n- mediterranean branzino: i was disappointed in this dish. the fish was bland and the overall flavor was nothing special.\n\ndesserts\n\n- amedei <mark>Chocolate Cake</mark>: loved this!! the only thing that would have made it better is more gelato. it only comes with a tiny scoop and goes quickly with how chocolaty the cake is. simple solution: request extra gelato while ordering.\n\n- zeppole (with nutella center and vanilla sauce): we debated over getting this and splitting the two different desserts or just getting two <mark>Chocolate Cake</mark> (which we knew we'd love). i'm so glad decided to give it a try as it ended up being our favorite!! i'd definitely recommend it to others dining here.", 
            "yet another really superb las vegas dining experience.  scott conant did not disappoint.  we came here shortly after the restaurant/hotel opened and even then, everything was done remarkably well.  between our table we sampled a variety of menu items and we really enjoyed the meal.  i particularly loved the shortrib pasta and the <mark>Wild Striped Bass</mark>.  the desserts here are also not to be missed-- specifically the <mark>Chocolate Cake</mark> with salted caramel gelato.  need i say more?", 
            "scarpetta was a great find in the cosmopolitan hotel in las vegas.  the decor is intimate yet trendy - as you walk into the restaurant along the bar there are several tables set into nooks along the wall which seem pretty cool.  the main dining room is full of comfortable tables although the aisles do get a bit crowded from time to time.\n\nthe service was good.  our waiter was a bit verbose and over-the-top with his descriptions of the menu items but he provided answers to our questions and recommendations throughout the meal.\n\nthe food is the real star of the show here.  it was outstanding from the bread basket through dessert.  we ordered several appetizers including the polenta mushroom soup (creamy and rich), the beet salad, and the braised short ribs (outstanding flavor and cooked perfectly).  several of us ordered the spaghetti for dinner and really enjoyed it - the sauce was nice and light and the basil really popped in the dish.  we also commented on the quality of the homemade pasta noodles.  a simple yet well done dish.  others had the ravioli and tortellini dishes which were equally good.\n\nfor dessert they offer a banana and nutella dish with doughnuts.  this dessert is not to be underestimated - it was fantastic!  we also ordered the <mark>Chocolate Cake</mark> dessert which was very rich and full of chocolate goodness as well.\n\ni highly recommend scarpetta for dinner if you are in vegas, you will not be disappointed.", 
            "scarpetta is an excellent restaurant, but it is also extremely overpriced. the portion sizes are very small and the prices are ridiculous.\n\ni started my meal off with the roasted diver scallops. these are served with sunchokes, pinenuts, gremolata and mushrooms. awesome appetizer...fresh and delicious.\n\nfor my main course, i ordered perigord black truffle tagliatelle. this truffle was definitely amazing, i was just disappointed in the quantity. they put literally three small shavings in my dish of plain pasta (no vegetables...nothing) and this cost $65. i understand that 1 oz of these truffles is $60-100, but at the same time they could have at least put 5 or 6 shavings. i thought this was a total rip-off. i mean this is black truffle, not even white truffle! i have been to other high-end restaurants where i pay the same price and they will literally shave a whole truffle into my pasta. next time, i will boil my own plain pasta at home and order these truffles online. the cost will be the same but at least i will be getting what i pay for...value!!\n\nfor dessert, i ended my meal with the amedei <mark>Chocolate Cake</mark> served with gelato and salted caramel sauce. rich and luscious dessert to finish off the night.        \n                      \ni recommend checking out scarpetta for dinner, just avoid ordering the black and white truffles and be sure to bring a full wallet!", 
            "what an awesome italian restaurant.  the entrance is super secluded, and as the hostess led us down an empty hallway it seemed like the place was abandoned, but the hallway opened up into a large dining room.  we were seated by the windows and could see the bellagio fountains which was nice. \n    i got the berry smash to drink which was very average, a little too strong for my taste.  the bread basket they brought out was great, focacia, french bread and one more were average.  the best bread had salami and basil and maybe even cheese baked into it- so good.  there was a citrus olive oil to dip in, as well as butter, and an eggplant tomato spread.  definitely helped to liven up the more basic bread.  \n     the duck and <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark> were great.  first time having foie gras and we were not disappointed.  rich and delicious.  the spaghetti was unreal good- i did not think spaghetti could be that great.  finally, the veal chop looked great, and was very rich and tender.  the <mark>Chocolate Cake</mark> for dessert was probably the low point- it reminded us of an applebee's dessert, although the presentation was slightly better than that.  \n     the only other con was our server- he was very awkward and seemed to appear at all the wrong times to talk to us about the menu.  he rambled on about dishes just a little too much.  \n     would definitely have given a 5 with a different server and had we picked a different and hopefully better dessert.", 
            "my sister asked me to find a good place to have pre-christmas dinner with our mom in las vegas and i actually found scarpetta by searching for top rated restaurants near the strip with foie gras. seriously. i need my foie gras.\n\nwith the recent foie gras ban in california keeping me from one of my favorite delicacies, i definitely wanted to have it if i was crossing state lines.  scarpetta stuck out to me because it wasn't a french restaurant, but an italian one, which is my mom's favorite... and a great way for everyone to be happy.\n\nscarpetta was perfect. situated in the new and beautiful cosmopolitan hotel, it has an amazing view of the bellagio and definitely has that upscale \"we are dining somewhere really fancy\" vibe.  the server was really enthusiastic about the dishes and described them each eloquently (i read one person's review that found this annoying, but i thought it was great!) and helped with recommendations for what to order.\n\nstarter:\n\npolenta with mushrooms. oh. my god. to die for. seriously.  wow.  best dish of the night and that's saying a lot because everything was great.\n\nmains:\n\nduck and <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark> - obviously what i ordered and obviously i loved it.  i was also pleasantly surprised by the portion size. usually when you order ravioli you get like, 4, and are left being hungry, but not in this case. it was a generous portion.  i would have loved there to be more foie gras but that's just being greedy.\n\nfennel spiced <mark>Black Cod</mark> - my mom ordered this and it was probably the least interesting thing that we had, but still delicious.\n\nblack tonarelli - my sister ordered this and it was also amazing, al dente, just as it should be.  it took about 10 minutes to come out after the rest of the dishes and they kept apologizing profusely for it and then sent out two free desserts to make up for it.\n\n(free!) desserts:\n\nmascarpone cheesecake - lighter than your average cheesecake, which made me like it more.\n\namaedi <mark>Chocolate Cake</mark> - like a lava cake, but better.. the perfect texture / consistency with hot melted chocolate inside... served with almond ice cream...\n\nthis was one of the best italian meals i've ever had outside of italy,  and i've tried all of those overrated high end italian restaurants in los angeles. i was expecting much less, thinking this was a bit of a tourist trap that i was buying into for the evening. it ended up being so much more. i was so pleasantly surprised and happy with the experience. also, no bs portion sizes.. these are hearty portions and you will leave full.\n\ndefinitely one of my top (if not the top) italian restaurants outside italy.  i just may need to go visit the scarpetta in la.", 
            "disappointed...that's the best way to describe my experience at the much hyped scarpetta, at the beautiful cosmopolitan hotel.  our group of four shared several appetizers, entrees and deserts, but none were memorable.  portion sizes were very small, and way over priced.  of the starters, the thimble of steak tartare was tasty, but was only served with three slivers of garlic toast, so one of us got short changed.  the oysters and polenta were mediocre at best.  our entrees included the signature tomato and basil spaghetti, a short rib filled pasta, and a carbonara style squid ink pasta that was very bland.  none of the main dishes were served very hot, and cooled quickly as we transferred them to our plates.  the deserts were undoubtedly the best part of the meal. the lava style <mark>Chocolate Cake</mark>, and the sugar coated donuts were a hit.  the cheesecake had a sour aftertaste.  service was excellent at scarpetta, as we were attended to by a flurry of servers.  unfortunately, good service is not enough to bring me back next time.  if you are in vegas and want to try a new restaurant, go somewhere else, but stop by the cosmopolitan to check out the hotel and enjoy a drink in one of the many beautiful lounges.", 
            "no words can describe how happy this experience made me. \n\ni was in vegas for a slightly belated celebration of my birthday, and a timely celebration of my friend's. scarpetta fell on the night we celebrated my birthday, and i am so glad! \n\nthe restaurant looks great and the service is perfect. the waiters are all extremely knowledgeable and can answer pretty much anything. \n\nbut who cares about that? the food... it was ridiculous! to begin with they bring out some bread, as with most restaurants, but scarpetta bread is next level! there were some regular rolls which were bomb. but there was this one type, no clue what it was called...but it had some kind of meat inside! i thought the waiter mentioned that to us, but i figured i was hallucinating. nope! it was phenomenal. the bread also came with butter and other accoutrement. all delicious!\n\nso i could have left happy at this point. but my food slayed me. i think i may have actually died, said what up to a couple of angels, and then rejoined my table after frolicking on a cloud or two. i ordered the black fettuccine (pasta dyed with squid ink, adorned with king crab, squid, shrimp, and breadcrumbs while bathing in lobster broth). need i say more? it tasted better than it sounds. it was more than worth the $42 it cost. \n\ni also tried my friends' flank steak (amazing) and <mark>Black Cod</mark> (also amazing). but lets be real...i won.\n\nas a dessert we shared:\n\nbombolone - basically an italian doughnut. there were five. two filled with nutella and three filled with something white that by some ungodly magic was better than nutella! never thought i'd say that. it also came with banana gelato which just pushed my taste buds past their limits of joy.\n\namadei <mark>Chocolate Cake</mark>: the richest most delicious <mark>Chocolate Cake</mark> you'll ever have. the inside was filled with molten chocolate goodness. it also came with toasted almond gelato. also heavenly.\n\ni implore you to try this restaurant when in vegas.", 
            "the best view on the strip for a romantic dinner facing the bellagio's water show.  the only minor detail that could have made it much better was the structural beam that went right across us at eye level.  apparently the space was originally designed to be the kitchen and not the main dining room.\n\nanyway, the food, the meal, the experience.  we did the tasting menu which was amazing & expensive but amazing!  to wrap it up in a nutshell we enjoyed duck, fish, scallop, shoe string calamari & zucchini, polenta with a mushroom broth, tomato basil spaghetti (famous on foodtv), & decadent warm <mark>Chocolate Cake</mark> and delightful peach soupy thing for dessert. yes!  all of that in one meal.  i almost needed a wheelchair just to get out of there.\n\nour server was so attentive and the wines that were paired with each dish was just perfect.  heaven.  enough said.", 
            "it was a red-meat night. my husband and i shared a beef tartare served with a quail egg. i was worried about eating the <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> and was glad we shared it, otherwise i don't know if i could have finished it by myself. it was delicious. we also shared the main meal, prime rib with lardo mashed potatoes and honey glazed carrots. so yum and tender! i highly recommend it. \nwe shared the entire meal in order to make it to dessert only to find that the dessert there doesn't cut it. i mean it was okay, just not worth the price. i tried their nutella & vanilla creme bombolini. it was okay. i hate saying this, cause i'm a nutella fan, but the nutella really brought the dessert down a notch. it didn't taste like a fine dining dessert. the banana bombolini tasted like banana pudding, so that wasn't good either. my husband tried the <mark>Chocolate Cake</mark> and he thought the presentation was lacking and the cake was only okay. their esperesso was very strong, a good way to end the night.\nfyi the drinks are delicious and pleasantly strong. i tried the berry smash and my husband had a few billionaires, both were good.\noverall: the food is super delicious, but skip the dessert.", 
            "i was very excited to dine here and left feeling like i'd had a really good, not necessarily memorable meal. the best part was the gluten-free menu; that is always easier than \"i don't know, let me check with the kitchen.\". \n\nwe were seated next to the bus station in spite of having a reservation, and there was a table by the window open the entire time we were there. \n\nthe service was excellent, attentive, not obtrusive.\n\nwines by the glass were good, but as another reviewer mentioned, overpriced.\n\nthe food was very good. i had the spaghetti with tomatoes and basil, which many reviews mentioned as \"amazing\". i have a very similar recipe at home that i enjoy equally. the <mark>Creamy Polenta</mark> with mushrooms was a great starter. everyone else enjoyed their meals.\n\nmy husband ordered a flourless <mark>Chocolate Cake</mark>, which he practically inhaled. there were closed eyes and moans of pleasure with each bite.", 
            "damn this was such a good meal!  my friends and i dined here for restaurant week 2013 and all of us, but one, ordered off the restaurant week menu.  it all began when i made reservations on open table, courtesy of the <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> app on my iphone.  i didnt have any preference of where we sat, but where the hostess sat us was remarkable!  we got a window seat facing the bellagio, so not only did we enjoy a delicious meal, we also got to enjoy a fantastic view of the strip, the bellagio, and also the bellagio fountain show all at once!  now this was a meal to remember!  service was top notch, there were no disappointments there; the waiter we had was very attentive and helpful in helping us make our selection from the menu.  \n\ncourse 1: <mark>Braised Short Ribs of Beef</mark> short rib - very tender pieces of sliced beef on top of what they called a risotto (not the traditional type of risotto) but it was still delicious!  the \"risotto\" was basically diced pieces of vegetables which supported the 3-4 pieces <mark>Braised Short Ribs of Beef</mark> on top.  very good combination of flavors and textures.  very impressed.  \n\nbefore the second course came, we were all scarfing down their stromboli bread which is complimentary with our meal!  it came with other bread, which were not that memorable.  the bread was also served with three types of spreads, an eggplant marinara spread, olive oil, and something else i cannot remember. on a side note, one of my friends even asked the waiter to bring an entire basket filled with the bread, which he did!  that made her evening! haha.  \n\ncourse 2: jidori chicken - now i didn't know what a jidori chicken was, so i asked the waiter.  this whole time, i thought it was the way the chicken was cooked!  but instead, it is the type of chicken used to make the chicken, like using kurabuta pork.  i can definitely tell the difference with kurabuta pork and regular pork, but this jidori chicken was a bit more difficult to tell the difference from regular chicken, besides the fact that this chicken was moist throughout!  maybe that's what makes jidori chicken so good?  well, next time i will know! =d  \n\nnot only did i have the second course as my main meal, i had to try their handmade spaghetti everyone raves about!  so i ordered a dish for everyone to share!  in conclusion, it was pretty damn good.  what makes it good is the noodles!  the texture is not too over or undercooked, but just right!  i guess the handmade pasta really makes a difference in a pasta dish!  \n\ncourse 3: <mark>Chocolate Cake</mark> with salted caramel ice cream - now how can you end a meal without dessert!?  my stomach was so distended prior to the second course, but i had to taste everything!  by the time dessert came, i swear i have a second stomach!  i devoured not only my dessert, but my friends dessert too!  she ordered the stuffed donuts with nutella....what?! nutella in fried dough?  yes!  nuff said. ;-)  \n\ni'd definitely come back to scarpetta again!  quite pricey for a student like myself, so probably come again with my family, during restaurant week, or when i start making the big bucks!", 
            "we came here on a wednesday evening for a company meeting. our menu consisted of a full course meal: \nprimi - served family style\n1. <mark>Creamy Polenta</mark> - fricassee of truffled mushrooms\n2. heirloom tomato salad - burrata, marinated eggplant \npasta - served family style \n1. spaghetti - tomato and basil \npiatti - individual \n1. fennel dusted <mark>Black Cod</mark> - concentrated tomatoes, mantecato, black olive oil \n2. organic jidori chicken - mustard spatzle carrots, fegato sauce\ndolce - served family style\n1. amedei <mark>Chocolate Cake</mark> - toasted almond gelato, salted caramel sauce\n\n- hard to find! literally, it's like a crevice on the third floor of the cosmo! wtf, weird entrance. \n- nice staff. presentable dining area for larger groups. fast at wine refills. \n- i loved the spaghetti! although simple, the noodles tasted great! the flavoring was fresh and rich. \n- their polenta was unremarkable. cornmeal boiled in porridge. i prefer simple mashed potatoes. \n- fresh tomato salad! loved the ripe tomatoes. but awkward to eat as family-style. \n- the chicken was soft and tender. not too salty. i'm glad i got this over the cod. although the cod was flavored nicely, i didn't like picking some of the bones out of it. \n- dessert was amazing. not too sweet, but the correct balance to end of the meal.\n- overall, nice plating and nice night.", 
            "so while at a convention in vegas, my two co-workers and i came here for dinner on 10/6/13 on a recommendation from a friend who claimed it's the best restaurant in the city. all three of us did the tasting menu ($110 per person) and two of us opted for the wine pairing with it (additional $45 per person). with all the delicious looking options on the menu, it seemed this was the way to go. here's what was included: \n\n-duo of <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> and tuna \"susci\". wine pairing: adami, prosecco, veneto, n/v. the \"susci\" was the first tasting and my least favorite of all. nothing special to me. or at least i didn't get what was supposed to be special about it. the roll with the carrots was kind of gross actually. i was hoping things would turn around quickly, and they did. ohhhh they did.\n\n-roasted diver scallops, morels, sugar snap, watermelon radish & pea froth. wine pairing: iberian remix, albarino, edna valley 2009. \nthe scallops were cooked perfectly and i enjoyed the puree that was served on the side. my friend however didn't enjoy the wine that was paired with it. he's a big albarino drinker and said it tasted like \"it was sitting on the shelf a little too long.\" i didn't really notice that until he said it, but i have to agree. that could have just been a bad bottle though and not an accurate representation of the wine itself.\n\n\n-spaghetti tomato basil & <mark>Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti</mark>. wine pairing: il poggione, rosso di montalcino, tuscany 2008. i don't care what anyone says- the spaghetti was fantastic. i'm drinking the kool-aid here. yes, the sauce is very simple, but it really made me notice and appreciate the texture and freshness of the noodles more. sometimes spaghetti is better when it's simple i guess. i would definitely order it again. \n\nthe <mark>Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti</mark>- dish of the night. the three of us unanimously agreed on this. one of the best pasta dishes i've ever devoured in 10 seconds. the horseradish breadcrumbs were a great finishing touch.\n\n-fennel spiced <mark>Black Cod</mark>, concentrated tomatoes, mantecato & black olive oil. wine pairing: jermann red angel, pinot noir, friuli 2008. \nthe cod was spiced well, but maybe a tad undercooked for my liking. i still finished it. \n\n-<mark>Spiced Duck Breast</mark>, endive, preserved orange &\ncippollini. wine pairing: feudi di san gregorio, rubrato, aglianico, campania 2009. the duck was perfectly cooked and had tremendous flavor. my friend sitting next to me was already so stuffed by this point, that he couldn't eat his, so being the fat fuck that i am, i ate his too.\n\n-amedei <mark>Chocolate Cake</mark> toasted almond gelato. wine pairing: quinta do noval, colheita, tawny port, portugal 1997. i'm normally not a big dessert guy, but this cake was outstanding. perfect way to cap off the tasting.\n\n...and here were a few complimentary items our table was given to share:\n\n- bread basket. it was served with three different dips (citrus olive oil, tomato-eggplant, and marscapone butter). some of the pieces of bread had salami baked into it, and those were amazing! just try not to fill up on them if you're doing the tasting menu, because you have a lot of food on the way.\n\n- <mark>Creamy Polenta</mark> with fricassee of truffled mushrooms. the polenta was definitely one of the highlights, although it could have benefited from being a tad thicker since the mushroom sauce liquified it significantly, once mixed  in. but great flavors, nonetheless.\n\n- shoe string calamari and zucchini. i think there was some fennel in here too. we finished every last string.\n\n\nall three of us immensely enjoyed the tasting menu. to say that we were not left disappointed by the portion sizes would be an understatement. we could barely walk out of there without toppling over. i certainly didn't have much room for alcoholic beverages for the remainder of the night. probably a good thing, knowing me and vegas.\n\nyou might notice i didn't have much to say about the wines. that's because unlike the food, they were all pretty unremarkable. i'm a pretty avid wine drinker and i didn't recognize any of these wines by name before they were poured for me, so it was almost expected. if i ever did the tasting menu again, i'd most likely skip the wine pairing option and just order a bottle of something decent and familiar off their wine menu. \n\nmy biggest gripe about this place was the waiter. although friendly and accommodating, he could barely be heard over the background noise, and with his thick accent, it made him very difficult to understand. tastings obviously are supposed to be interactive and i had to ask him to repeat everything he said at least once. this became a little frustrating and kind of depreciated the experience for me. i wish he had left a copy of the menu on our table so i didn't have to go to their website afterward to finally discover what some of the things i ate were.\n\nthe bottom line is i would definitely return to scarpetta, especially since i just realized there is one in beverly hills (doh!).", 
            "authentic italian food and house made pasta--the only way to enjoy italian food. scarpetta was a lovely experience. the <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark> was great but the stand out was definitely the spaghetti--cooked to perfection. the orata (branzino) was nicely done, too. while i'd pass on the <mark>Chocolate Cake</mark> which tasted a bit generic, my favorite of the night was the pana cotta--delicious! the service was decent--slightly snobby but it comes with the territory. i'd love to dine here again.", 
            "amazing pasta.  my mom says it's not as good as italy but it is pretty dang close, and that's good enough for me.\n\nparking: it's located in the cosmo, third floor i believe at the corner near the restrooms, it's kind of small random entrance.  free parking at all lv hotels and a quick walk from any of the hotels on the strip.\n\natmosphere: dark, with a great view of the bellagio water fountains.  ask for a window seat if you're with a group of 2, if you have a bigger group you can still get pretty close but not right up to the window.  there were actually a lot of big groups that we saw and they have several private rooms for big parties like birthdays or celebrations, which i thought was cool.\n\nfood: had to get the spaghetti with tomato and basil.  it doesn't look like a lot in the pictures but when you  unravel the pasta, it's plenty for one person especially if you're going to be getting any appetizers or dessert.\n\nbread basket - they give you all kinds of bread, sourdough, focaccia, stromboli (i think thats what its called with salami and cheese) and for those allergic to dairy, the foccacia is dairy free!!\n\n<mark>Creamy Polenta</mark> - sooo good, and i don't even like polenta!! it's creamy like mashed potatoes and so flavorful (prob a lot of butter) with the mushrooms it was perfect.\n\ntuna 'susci' - also very good, and very fresh! a tun roll but the tuna was wrapped around the outside, i dont remember what was inside but it was tasty.  \n\nspaghetti - so amazing.  they hand make it everyday and you can tell.  it was al dente and chewy, fresh!! and the sauce was delicious, light but flavorful and something that seemed so simple but blew me away.  also for those allergic to dairy they can make it without butter and milk and my sister said it tasted just as good.  i tried a piece and it was good, but definitely not as flavorful as mine.  \n\namedei <mark>Chocolate Cake</mark> - your basic rich, <mark>Chocolate Cake</mark> with a slight runny inside.  it was a great way to end the night but by the end of it i was  completely stuffed.\n\noverall, a great place to try if you're looking for a fancy place in vegas.  the pasta is like $26 and the atmosphere, although not the best i've ever had, is good and romantic for a date or a fancy dinner with the family.  just make sure you get a good window seat!",

            "i am a fan of scott conant from chopped fame but i have to say the las vegas outpost of his iconic nyc restaurant just did not live up to the hype.  i went with a group of guys and we ordered the tasting menu.  they were nice enough to allow us to order it on a friday night since it is usually not offered on that night of the week.  we tasted 8 dishes for $110 pp.  the quantity of food was great - really full at the end of the meal - but most of the dishes were just ok.\n\nthe real highlight for me was the <mark>Creamy Polenta</mark> with truffled mushrooms.  wow, that was delicious.  probably the creamiest polenta i've ever had and it paired so nicely with the earthiness of the truffles and mushrooms.   the <mark>Chocolate Cake</mark> served for the dessert course was also terrific, served with toasted almond gelato.  too bad i was so full by that time i could only have a couple of bites.  nothing else was particularly memorable.  \n\ndisappointing for me was the restaurant's signature spaghetti - a seemingly simple preparation of pasta, fresh tomatoes and basil.  it arrived very simply plated -  a perfect cylinder mold of spaghetti covered by a clear plastic cloche that i suppose is meant to preserve the freshness of the preparation or perhaps to concentrate the aroma.  the cloches are removed with a flourish releasing nice smells of tomato and basil.  the pasta was a bit overcooked and the sauce, while wonderfully creamy (how do they do that?) was just too sweet, as if chef conant and chef boyardee had a bastard love-child.\n\nanother disappointment was the <mark>Black Cod</mark>.  in the past i have found this fish to be among the most delicious owing to its high fat content and buttery texture and flavor.  scarpetta's rendition of this fish, pan-roasted with concentrated tomatoes and roasted fennel, was so overcooked that it was unrecognizable as <mark>Black Cod</mark>.  just a piece of fish.\n\nother dishes were a bit more successful including the <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> of <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> and tuna, the diver scallops, the short rib/<mark>Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti</mark> and the <mark>Spiced Duck Breast</mark>.\n\nthe wine list is voluminous and expensive.  the cocktail menu offers some nice selections.\n\nthere is certainly a lot of eye candy to be enjoyed at this swank place in the cosmo.  however, one annoying thing was the lighting.  over every table there is a large fixture containing multiple <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark>/gold colored lights.  this lighting casts the food in a weird color and makes taking pictures of the food impossible.  all the food looks bad in the pictures i took - i suppose that's no surprise that the pictures were a disappointment too.", 
            "this was a solid 5 star meal for me and my two friends this past weekend. firstly, our server was amazing. i'm a bit of a pain and he was patient and helpful and very professional. he had great advice, and was very understanding of my gluten allergy (and i was thrilled that they had a separate gluten free menu). every dish ordered was an 'oh wow you gotta taste this\" moment. my friends said the stromboli bread basket with the choice of marscapone butter, lemon olive oil and eggplant caponata kicked off the night. other standouts included the <mark>Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti</mark>, polenta with mushroom ragout and the <mark>Chocolate Cake</mark> with almond gelato and salted caramel. even the music was great. i had been hating being in vegas- the riff-raff, over-designed spaces,  overpriced fussy but mediocre food, but this restaurant redeemed the trip. note to the management- if you already have a gluten free menu why not put it on the website with the other menus?? i wish we had known about this place earlier.", 
            "superb service, great food. \nthere are so many choices in las vegas it can be overwhelming. we wanted to try scott conant's scarpetta because we had heard it was very good. we made reservations and arrived on time. they were just opening and we sat at the bar and had a drink. the bar is gorgeous and the bartender was very friendly. \nafter we were seated and ordered drinks they brought us a really nice bread tray. i recommend the salami and cheese bread as the best of the bunch but everything in there was superb. the marscapone butter was a nice touch. \ni ordered the <mark>Creamy Polenta</mark> with truffled mushrooms for an app. super dish, and creamy really does describe it. i could make a meal out of it. \nfor my main course i had the short rib and <mark>Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti</mark> which are like mini ravioli's. it was very rich and savory. the bread crumb crust on top was crispy and added some texture. don't let the term bone marrow scare you it merely adds a depth of flavor. \nfor dessert my wife had the flourless <mark>Chocolate Cake</mark> with homemade gelato. there was nothing wrong with my <mark>Coconut Panna Cotta</mark>, a custard like dessert but after tasting her cake i wish i has ordered that as well. \nall in all a great meal at a reasonable price. i would definitely go there again on our next rip to lv.",

            "you know those few precious moments when you're absolutely falling in love with a dish? like your eyes roll back and you carefully savor each bite, wishing the experience will never end? it's an ecstasy that only a few restaurants can deliver. this describes my dinner experience at scarpetta, when i delicately pulled apart my fennel dusted spiced <mark>Black Cod</mark>. a bed of tomatoes and roasted fennel added a tangy zest to the fish. my lawd. this must be a dream. it's too good to be true!\n\nbam! snap back to reality. as i used my fork and knife to d<mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> piece of that tender cod to my mouth, i spotted a thin black line. hmm, that's an interesting lookin' spice. let me tug at it some more. lo and behold, it was a piece of hair, and it was definitely not mine. the hair was embedded in the cod's skin! i politely informed my waiter of the situation and he apologized, then asked if i would like to replace the cod with a different dish. i just wanted another cod. i wanted to return to that euphoria i was experiencing before my foodie world came crashing down on me when i discovered that unfortunate piece of keratin. \n\nlike forrest gump says, sh** happens. i understand that, but i'm at scarpetta. this is a high-caliber restaurant, one of the best in las vegas, owned by the famous chef scott conant. it's not something i would expect to happen here. my waiter was professional though, he quickly brought out another cod (since my partner was already done with his dish) and our dessert was on the house. i totally appreciate these gestures. yet, when my second cod arrived, it did not taste as heavenly as the initial one. i noticed that my second dish came out a lot faster than my first, which meant it was cooked in a shorter amount of time. the meat of my second cod looked a tad <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> it was almost rubbery in texture, not as moist and soft as my first one. there goes my foodie high. womp womp.\n\nthe kitchen staff probably invested less time and attention on my replacement dish. i know there was a slight rush to bring out my cod asap since my boyfriend already finished his entree. however, i was still paying for this dish and it was executed poorly compared to the first one. \n\nthis could have easily been a four or five star review. we asked for a table next to the window and the views of the strip and the bellagio fountains were stunning. so romantic and beautiful. my boyfriend and i started our dinner with the tuna \"susci\" with marinated vegetables and preserved truffles. this is essentially tuna wrapped around vegetables. it was almost like a sushi roll, but there was too much going on. we couldn't really tease out the tuna flavor.  \n\nmy boyfriend ordered the short rib & <mark>Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti</mark>. it's cooked in brown butter, horseradish, and toasted breadcrumbs. he said it was good but not amazingly tasty. he was still quite hungry after finishing his pasta. \n\nthe complimentary amedei <mark>Chocolate Cake</mark> with toasted almond gelato and salted caramel sauce was decadent. the chocolate was not overly sweet and the almond gelato was creamy.\n\nit wasn't purely the hair, but the fact that my second cod was unrecognizable compared to my first one. the rest of the items are pretty solid. the view is the best thing scarpetta has to offer. and maybe that <mark>Black Cod</mark>...when it is cooked properly.", 
            "scott conant's place in the cosmo is really nice and the food is delicious. the service was first class, i felt like i was aboard the titanic, haha. the waiter knew his shit and helped me and my buddies pair our dishes perfectly with some wines, and we're not quite wine guys, but we all enjoyed it. the desert, <mark>Chocolate Cake</mark>, was so rich and delicious and the caramelized almond sorbet made it. eat here and smile . thanks place.", 
            "i cannot wait to go back!! every bite of the <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark> was delectable, i cant describe how good it was. i also tried the berry cocktail which quenched my thirst and gave me the buzz i needed. and let me warn you about the <mark>Chocolate Cake</mark>...it's dangerous!! (in a good way).", 
            "like almost any restaurant, scarpetta has its pros and cons. let's start with the positives.\n\nambience: when you walk in you have to go through the bar to get to the dining room. the bar is long and narrow. it is quite inviting and incredibly attractive. they have small alcoves that seat two on the right hand side that would make a wonderful place to come to have a romantic drink before your evening starts. the main dining room is also beautifully decorated. if you were lucky enough to get a seat by the window, you have a terrific you of the bellagio fountains as well as looking down the las vegas boulevard strip. the tables are very nicely spaced so that you can have quiet conversation with the friends with whom you are dining and not be bothered by conversations from other tables. \n\nfood: the meal starts with a small basket of breads placed on the center of the table. if it were possible to have a \"bread orgasm\",  then the four of us had that shared experience on eating the breads. wow, it was that good! we decided we would share the pici ( normally a main course) as an appetizer for the four of us. this dish was incredibly good. it consisted of a green pasta cooked al dante with a generous portion of lobster meat mixed in. the sauce was a bit spicy but it was delicious. i had the new york strip steak as my main course. the quality of the meat was really mediocre even though it was cooked appropriately. i expected it to be much better in a high end restaurant. it came with some vegetables that were delicious. in addition we ordered a side of mushrooms for the table. this too was incredibly delicious. we shared a <mark>Chocolate Cake</mark> for dessert. the <mark>Chocolate Cake</mark> was a rich dark chocolate with a small scoop of gelato on top. the cake made me feel as if i had died and gone to heaven.\nservice: while our waiter did nothing wrong, he certainly did nothing to make us feel welcome. the service runners brought the food in a timely fashion although it was a little surprising that they did not know who was supposed to get which dish. the bus boy was it quite good. our water glasses never got below half full.", 
            "fantastic service, delicious drinks, great atmosphere, but let's be honest what's the primary reason for going to a nice restaraunt?  the food.  \n\nwe'll keep it simple, the food was meh for the price, and we are the type of people who are easily pleased. we started with the spiced artichoke soup.  it was brought out looking beautiful but it was bland:  light, but very subtle on the artichoke flavor and little to no \"spice.\"  our entrees were the tomato basil spaghetti and the tagiatelle, a truffle pasta with veggies.  for $24 and $27 respectively we were expecting the best tomato basil pasta and truffle pasta we ever had.  unfortunately we were not blown away.  neither dish had anything special going on with them, other than the spaghetti being a perfect al dente.  then we chose the <mark>Chocolate Cake</mark> served with an almond gelato and salted caramel.  nothing special, seriously so dissappointed, although \"happy anniversary\" was written so beautifully on the plate it almost made up for it.  looking back we should have gotten the bananas fosters because we heard about how great it is but unfortunately we didn't, because my wife wanted chocolate.  we were told the souffl\\u00e9 (bananas fosters), marscapone cheesecake, and the filled doughnuts were the top 3 deserts.\n\nwe appreciated the staff and the service and we tipped well at the end because of it, however when you spend $150 on a meal, with just 2 drinks, you just expect a bit more from the food.", 
            "i would highly recommend scarpetta to anyone traveling to vegas. this was one of the best italian restaurants i have ever been to. they have one of the best views of the fountains and the strip. i had the <mark>Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti</mark> and the <mark>Chocolate Cake</mark> for dessert. the pasta was like little pillows of heaven. in addition, neal, mario and the rest of the staff were amazing. five stars!", 
            "i ate here last night and boyfriend and i decided on the tasting menu! it was about 6 different courses, each with amazing flavor. the bread basket and dippings that come with were so good i had to restrain myself from gobbling it all up too quickly. the cocktails were way better than expected too. i had the scarpetta cosmo since we were at the cosmo. :)\n\ni think our favorite course might have been the ravioli and spaghetti? no, wait, definitely the <mark>Creamy Polenta</mark>. get the polenta. and the starter of tuna and <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> was phenomenal. there was also cod served and <mark>Spiced Duck Breast</mark>, which were both perfectly cooked and seasoned, but i was getting so full at that point that i gave up midway through the duck. the ending dessert was a rich dark <mark>Chocolate Cake</mark> with gelato. they switched out the flavor of gelato for my boyfriend due to a nut allergy and were really accommodating. and they gave us some kind of pineapple cream in lava soup? that tasted like it came straight from hawaii and the man doesn't even like bits of fruit in his food but helped me eat all of this one.\n\neverything was perfect! we left more full than we expected off of a tasting menu! service was great and very informative.", 
            "came here for a romantic anniversary dinner after seeing great reviews by other <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> and we were definitely steered in the right direction. \nwe had made reservation a week in advance and were hoping to get a table with a view of the bellagio fountains, though they told us they can't promise and that we will have to try our luck when we arrive. we made it to our reservation on time, yet we still had to wait 20 minutes, which was alittle annoying considering we had made reservations. though we didn't get a fountain view, we were too hungry at that point to care. \nour server immediately bought out a bread basket with a trio of olive oil, eggplant and honey butter. the bread was incredible!!! my favorite was the salami and cheese filled one (i still dream about it). for appettizer we got the mediterraen octopus, which was cooked just perfectly! for our entrees we got prime filet <mark>Braised Short Ribs of Beef</mark> and ravioli foie gras and duck. though the ravioli was underwhelming, there was lot of ravioli squares which really was great. the filet <mark>Braised Short Ribs of Beef</mark>, on the other hand, was absolutely amazing. it was perfectly cooked and the softest beef i've ever had in my life. this really was the greatest dish i've ever eaten in my life and i was beyond impressed. \nfor dessert, we had mentioned that it was our anniversary and were given a <mark>Chocolate Cake</mark> with happy anniversary writing, which was a lovely surprise. sadly,. the cake was very dry but the ice-cream helped. \nin all i would highly recommend scarpetta and would love to come back here for our next vegas trip!!", 
            "the best part of the meal was the bread basket, it was seriously the best bread i've ever had. we had the polenta and short rib appetizers and both were amazing. the short rib and bone morrow agnolotti with a brown butter sauce was excellent as was the <mark>Spiced Duck Breast</mark>. the pici noodles were perfect and perfectly spiced. the flavors were wonderful. the prime filet <mark>Braised Short Ribs of Beef</mark> was ok. we were all stuffed but we had to have the bomboloni and <mark>Chocolate Cake</mark>, yum!", 
            "romantic space with great view. i had the <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark>, which was quite good. tasted a lot like beef stroganoff. i don't drink, so i asked for the bartender to make me something non alcoholic that was fruity & sweet. not sure exactly what it was, but it was quite tasty. the <mark>Chocolate Cake</mark> did not meet expectations though. it was dry & not sweet enough. my husband & i did not finish it.", 
            "i had a great meal with excellent service. \n\nfood:\nbread basket was great!\nwe shared the polenta with mushrooms - so good!\ncavatelli with wild boar rag\\u00fa - hubby liked \nshort rib angliotti - really tasty \n<mark>Chocolate Cake</mark> hubby said it's one of the best he's had - perfect temperature\npanettone - very good. \n\nservice was on point. we never needed anything. \n\nwe'd definitely return. i'd like to try the regular tomato basil dish. \n\nthe best part was meeting the owner, scott conant! boy was i star-struck. he was very kind gracious to allow me to interrupt his meal. he offered to have his picture taken."

            "scarpetta is at the newly opened cosmopolitan hotel in las vegas and we dropped by on a whim and are glad we did.  this turned out to be a sensational dining experience.  every single morsel of food that passed our lips was a taste sensation.  we started out with the seared sea scallops, the chestnut soup and the beet salad.  each was out of this world delicious!  our entrees consisted of the <mark>Black Cod</mark> which was buttery and perfect, the sicilian <mark>Spiced Duck Breast</mark> which was tender and tasty and the duck and <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark> which was creamy and sensational.  we ended our dinner with two desserts and i would highly recommend the <mark>Coconut Panna Cotta</mark> guava soup with carmelized pineapple.  double-yum!  service was outstanding and although we did not have have a table with a view overlooking the las vegas strip, we enjoyed our comfortable booth with room enough on the table for all the dishes we ordered. i would definitely want to return to this restaurant again and would highly recommend it to everyone.", 
            "bravo to scarpetta for an excellent dinner this past weekend.  we were lucky enough to sit at the \"chef's table\" and we had a clear view of the kitchen at work.  we even heard the chef shout out orders like hell's kitchen: one risotto, two <mark>Spaghetti</mark>; we had a party of 9 for a birthday and they treated us like kings.  the waiter titus was an amazing help and made the meal excellent.  the food that was prepared was spot on! i had the world-renowned plate of goodness known as the spaghetti, but let me tell you this is not your typical pasta dish.  the pasta was cooked perfectly al dente and the infusion of fresh tomato and basil all concentrated into the smooth pasta was a burst of flavor in my mouth.  for my appetizer i had the polenta that \"has been stewing in the kitchen prepared by grandma for three hours.\" it was amazing; the best polenta i have had topped off with a truffle sauce mixture with mushrooms.  for dessert, i recommend the <mark>Coconut Panna Cotta</mark>, like i say a great <mark>Coconut Panna Cotta</mark>'s consistency should jiggle like a nice woman's bosom and this dish jiggled perfectly.  the melt in your mouth dessert with a hint of coconut was a perfect end to a grand evening.  go here and try it over and over again because the spaghetti is addictive.", 
            "leftovers for lunch yesterday, basically pasta all mashed together in a tupperware bowl, nuked into a hot mess. didn't have a fork, but ended up using 2 plastic knives as chopsticks to eat at my desk in front of my computer while i worked. first bite i had,  first thought was, \"omg!!! this is the worse pasta i have ever eaten in my life!  i can't believe i'm eating this!\"  then i proceeded to eat half of it, constantly thinking, \"why am i eating this!!?!?!\" before i finally throw the rest of the contents away in disgust.  why write about this experience?  because throughout that experience, i kept thinking of the best pasta i had ever eaten which was the spaghetti at scarpetta.  the texture, consistency, taste, and bite of the pasta was amazing!  the sauce was awesome, had a little bit of a kick to it.  i have to admit i have had better sauce, just barely, but that's because i really like a lot of garlic in my sauce, but the combination of the sauce and the spaghetti was incredible.  the rest of the meal was very good, the tomatoes & burrata dish, short ribs, polenta with truffles and assorted mushrooms, <mark>Black Cod</mark> with roasted tomatoes and fennel, <mark>Coconut Panna Cotta</mark>, and cr\\u00e8me brule were all excellent, but that pasta kicked this restaurant up another notch.  if you make reservations, ask for a window seat since we had an amazing view of the water show at the venetian.", 
            "scarpetta won't let you down. i went with 2 friends who really know and love food (one of them is a really talented professional chef with years of experience) and we all agreed it was fantastic.\n\nwe had the spaghetti, the duck and <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark>, and the black farfalle to start. and it was all good. the ravioli were off the charts and the other two were good, not amazing but tasty. for some reason when the farfalle came out all the sauce had shifted to the bottom of the dish so at first bite i was like wtf, and then i got to the bottom where all the sauce and lobster were hanging out - mmmmmmmmm. nom nom nom. \n\nthe entrees were amazing. i had the cod, and i tasted the sirloin steak - which was excellent. the deserts were amazing too. we had the <mark>Coconut Panna Cotta</mark>, the <mark>Chocolate Cake</mark> and the nutella filled donut holes and they were fucking rad. \n\nthis is a really pretty restaurant too inside, its beautifully designed and it has a view of the bellagio fountain which is cool. its a place to take the misses for sure. \n\nwe had 3 appetizers, 3 entrees, 3 deserts and wine and including tip the bill came out to 120 per person. a very reasonable price for such good food and service.", 
            "i wanted to love scarpetta, i really did. i was still mesmerized by the striking view i got to take in during the grand opening and determined to prove all of the reviews about the mediocre service wrong, but our waiter left me no choice but to report otherwise.\n\ni want to point out the highlights before i rip scarpetta to shreds. i came in for restaurant week so got the pre-fixe menu and chose the <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark>, <mark>Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti</mark>, and <mark>Coconut Panna Cotta</mark>. i thought the <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> had great flavor and was presented beautifully. my only complaint was that it seemed to be served a little on the warm side to me which is a concern when it comes to <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark>.\n\nthe <mark>Coconut Panna Cotta</mark>/guava soup was not only delicious but beautiful too. the almost tart soup was a nice contrast to the creamy <mark>Coconut Panna Cotta</mark>-probably the best <mark>Coconut Panna Cotta</mark> i've ever had! not too rich or too sweet, and again, perfectly balanced with the cold fruit soup. i usually don't go for dessert soups, but i'd probably come back just for that.\n\nthe view is killer-great front row seats to the bellagio water show!\n\nnow for the bad.\n\nstrike one: maybe this is just me being very nitpicky, but the presentation of the <mark>Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti</mark> was just gross. the pasta was served in a wide, shallow bowl and the appearance of pasta in one thin layer with hardly any garnish (save the breadcrumbs which had a nice flavor) was just unappetizing. also, the pasta was incredibly greasy. i've had pasta in brown butter sauce before that didn't look like that. the filling was good, very rich and flavorful, but the sauce was just off-putting. \n\nstrike two: for the duration of our dinner, a toddler continuously screamed at the top of his lungs, banged on the table, stood on the booth in which his family was sitting and annoyed the crap out of the surrounding diners. as a fine dining restaurant, it's your responsibility to make sure that the experience is just that, fine dining. which means if you need to tell this family who cannot control their spoiled infant to beat it, in the interest of preserving the experience for surrounding diners, then do it. after an hour of embarrassing behavior and ugly stares from other tables, the dad who was elegantly dressed in board shorts, shower shoes and a baseball cap removed the child from the fine dining situation. i feel like the management should've handled this earlier, but god forbid they offend one person who is offending the entire restaurant. \n\nstrike three: our waiter was a dud. i get it, everyone has their off days, but i think this waiter's life was a series of off days. i'm hoping that his service standards weren't lowered because we were getting what was essentially a discounted menu, but i can't help that think this was the case. discounted menu=less tip? not always. but if your behavior warrants a tip to match the discounted bill then that's what you'll get. it took about 15 minutes for bread to come out and for the waiter to bring water. then another 15 minutes for him to take our order for wine. and about another 20 minutes to take our food order. i shouldn't have to flag you down and tell you we're ready to order. that's not my job as a patron of the restaurant. i wasn't in any rush, but those lapses in time mean either this dude was just straight up inattentive or suffering the early stages of dementia. everything about the dinner just dragged on unnecessarily. he was inattentive and seemed disinterested in our table-there were only two of us and we're definitely not high maintenance so i'm not sure what the issue was.\n\nour waiter was in no way personable and just rubbed me the wrong way. maybe we caught him on a bad night. maybe he didn't feel like we deserved the attention that someone who was ordering off of the regular menu did. regardless, in these economically unbalanced times, when so many people are opting to eat cheaper or stay home and cook, i feel like the restaurant industry should feel the pressure to give diners the experience they pay for. even if we were getting your dishes for a reduced price-we are still dining in your restaurant and your standard of service should be equal across the board. you are a fine dining restaurant and i hold you to a higher standard than, say a denny's. but if you perform like a denny's waiter, i will tip you like a denny's waiter. \n\n\ni'm not sure i would come back because i was truly annoyed with the service. maybe i'd come back for the guava soup...and have it at the bar.", 
            "the mediocre: although good, the $24 spaghetti is not really justified by the price. stay away from that <mark>Chocolate Cake</mark>. it's the heaviest, tiniest, piece of <mark>Chocolate Cake</mark> i have ever had. it's good, but way heavy.\n\nthe better: the short rib with farro risotto. oh so yum! how can you screw up short ribs?\n\nthe out of this world: the <mark>Coconut Panna Cotta</mark> with guava soup and coconut ice cream. very few desserts i eat are memorable. this one is very memorable. for a <mark>Coconut Panna Cotta</mark>, this dessert was extremely light and had just a hint of sweetness (i thought the guava was going to make it super sweet, but it didn't). i would come back and eat here just for this dessert. no joke!\n\nour service was great. request a table near one of the windows so you can see the fountain show at bellagio.", 
            "our server started us out with an array of different breads, accompanied by mascarpone butter, an eggplant tomato caponata & citrus olive oil. i often tend to judge a meal as soon as the bread (or chips... etc) arrives to the table. first impressions are crucial! if you ever dine at scarpetta, dig for the warm stromboli loaf in your bread basket first! it pairs really wonderfully with the caponata, but also stands strong on its own. you definitely want to eat this bread while its hot- because its stuffed with layers of salami & mozzarella. yum!\n\nmy first course was <mark>Braised Short Ribs of Beef</mark> over a farro risotto. the beef was immensely tender & alive with flavor. it had a very thin slice of parmesan resting on top of it, just barely melted. nice touch! i loved how hearty the risotto was- this is nothing my mom would have ever prepared for me...but somehow the risotto tasted home-y. i didn't even have time to identify all the vegetables that were in this dish, because i was far too busy stuffing my face. between bites of the short ribs, i had a few pieces of <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark>. incredibly fresh, with such great flavor. unknown to me at the time, it was adorn with almost microscopic red onions (gross)...but i ate each piece very willingly- despite my hatred for onions.\n\nfor my main course i had the <mark>Prime Aged Sirloin</mark> <mark>Braised Short Ribs of Beef</mark>. it was served with wild mushrooms, potato gnocchi & barolo ragu. everything on the plate was exceedingly juicy & robust, without being overwhelming. the gnocchi was a great equalizer to the sirloin and the ragu. this dish was really unforgettable, hats off to scott conant.\n\ndessert was very simple! <mark>Coconut Panna Cotta</mark> served with coconut sorbetto, pineapples & guava soup, ofcourse this is my pick- being a true hawaiian & all. i could have done without the crushed pineapples, i felt like they interfered with the guava coconut vibe i had going. i had mentally prepared myself for the guava soup to be too sweet, but fortunately, i was incorrect. in addition to that, i was thrilled with how smooth the <mark>Coconut Panna Cotta</mark> was. each bite was like silk!\n\nin short, i loved scarpetta. 4 stars!", 
            "restaurant week 2011. the wife and i only planned on going out only once for restaurant week, but after perusing all the menus we were persuaded to try one more place -- scarpetta at the cosmopolitan. we were seated at a two-top by the window overlooking the bellagio fountains. one of the better views in town, it makes for a great spot for a romantic night out. the clean lines and modern motif of the restaurant interior add to the upscale and elegant atmosphere.\n\nscarpetta might have one of the best bread baskets around, but that can solely be attributed to the stromboli found within. warm, chewy and delicious, it's almost a meal itself. the focaccia isn't bad either.\n\nthe first two dishes were <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> and polenta. the <mark>Raw Yel Lowtai L</mark> consisted of four slices of fish topped with olio di zenzero, pickled red onions and microgreens. a couple slices were bland and under seasoned, while others were perfect. the other app ordered came on the recommendation of our waiter. and, i'm glad i listened to him. the <mark>Creamy Polenta</mark> came in a decent sized bowl along with a pot with truffled mushrooms fricassee, which the server promptly spooned into the polenta. the rich and savory dish was unlike any polenta i've had before. \n\nthe <mark>Prime Aged Sirloin</mark> beef entree came sliced, cooked medium rare as ordered and was accompanied by a few light and fluffy potato gnocchi, wild mushrooms, barolo ragu, and topped with paper thin slices of parmigiano. the sirloin was good, but not nearly as good as the other entree.\n\nthe <mark>Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti</mark> didn't look like much when it was placed on the table -- a shallow bowl filled with a modest amount of small stuffed pasta. but, the flavor from each bite was amazing. each piece was a thin, delicate piece of pasta stuffed with tender short rib, with an intensely rich sauce. i loved the added texture that the bread crumbs added. it was a great dish on every level.\n\ndesserts were tasty, as well. amadei <mark>Chocolate Cake</mark> with toasted almond gelato and salted caramel sauce was dense and moist. the <mark>Coconut Panna Cotta</mark> with coconut sorbetto, guava soup and pineapple was surprisingly light, creamy, and not too filling. it was a beautiful presentation with the guava soup covering and contrasting the <mark>Coconut Panna Cotta</mark> below.\n\nour service was a perfect compliment to our meal. luis timed everything perfectly and provided the kind of personalized, friendly service that every top-notch restaurant should have.\n\ni've had plenty of underwhelming experiences over the years for restaurant week, but this was definitely one of the best. i'm already thinking about when i'll be able to come back and hopefully enjoy more great food and service.", 
            "i mostly frequent the scarpetta in miami, but while in vegas last month we stayed at the cosmopolitan and decided to give this location a whirl.  we are big fans of the spaghetti in miami and wanted to see if it would be the same.\n\nwho would have thought that an unassuming spaghetti dish would be so amazing?  it doesn't even have any meat in it and it is so good!  i get my own because i don't like to share it.  if you want to try other things, it's great to split because it is very rich....cheese and cream, and butter...oh my!   the bread is delish, especially the stromboli, love the accoutrements, olive oil, mascarpone butter, eggplant spread. the heirloom tomato salad is always a good stand by as well.  we had the scallop appetizer this time, and it was very good.  we never really have room for dessert, and had to catch a show, so we passed. maybe next time we will try the <mark>Coconut Panna Cotta</mark>.\n\nall in all, i still love the miami location better. the service is pretty consistent with both locations, just a different slightly more relaxed vibe in miami.  besides, who can beat a view of the ocean and the sleek, modern, nautical decor of scarpetta miami.",

            "the wife and i were in vegas on vacation and her younger cousin and his gf were in town the same week so we wanted to take them out to a nice dinner.  i didn't have a chance to check out scarpetta when i was last here in november, so this seemed like a perfect time.  \n\nthe room is absolutely beautiful, and we were lucky enough to get seated near a window, so we could also watch the bellagio fountain show at the same time.  i was thinking, this night is going to be perfect right......maybe not.  so the server comes to take our drink order.  i'm a simple guy, so i just ordered a miller lite.......he kind of looks at me and is like \" bud \".  i'm like ok, nevermind.  can i get a stella instead?  he's like yup.  i'm like.... ok.  then he leaves and the busser brings over the bread basket full of win~!  the bread was a salami roll, as well as some focaccia, and what looked like some french baguette.  the busser really explained the different condiments they had for the bread well.  he had a thick accent, so it was a little difficult to understand, but he did a nice job explaining it.  he left and our server came back with the beer....a bud.  i'm like...seriously, i just told you  stella?  then my wife's cousin asks him a bit about the condiments (mascarpone, some eggplant tapenade, and some olive oil) and if there is a certain one that is recommended for the different breads.   he's like i don't know, they're all good.  i'm like....seriously?  then we get around to ordering our apps and entrees.  we started with the braised shortribs and the <mark>Crispy Fritto Misto</mark>.....both were great.  the shortribs were very tender and flavorful.  the <mark>Crispy Fritto Misto</mark>,was crunchy and not oily either.  we then ordered our entrees. my wife and her cousin ordered the <mark>Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti</mark>, the cousins gf ordered the lamb loin.  haha, we could already tell how our waiter was, so for fun, she asked him how the lamb was.  you would think at a nicer upscale restaurant like this, he would boast about the preparation, or the sauce, or how tender the meat was......nope.  when she asked how it was, he said \"good.\"  really?  i thought restaurants made money by putting crap on the menu?  anyways, back to lucky old me.  i asked the waiter about the spaghetti with basil (which is what lots of people rave about) or the stracci.  he was like it's ok, but it's kind of plain.  not sure if he was trying to upsell me, but i don't know if scott conant would appreciate one of his servers calling his food plain.  anyways, i took his advice and order the stracci.  or did i?  because even if i ordered the stracci, that's not what was placed in front of me when the rest of the order came around.  i looked at the guy and was like \"didn't i tell you stracci?\"  oh, i'm not sure, let me check.  seriously?  what the hell, can this really be happening.  anyways, i waited patiently like a fool, while everybody else ate.  to scarpetta's defense, all the entrees were really good and flavorful, just the guy serving us needed a clue.  we moved on to dessert and ordered the <mark>Chocolate Cake</mark> (a bit too heavy for me), the <mark>Coconut Panna Cotta</mark> (awesome!), and the cheesecake (light, airy, completely delicious).  the waiter comped us an order of zeppole's for his lack of service, and it too was great.  \n\noverall, i was just disappointed that the service was so poor.  i was really looking forward to having a wonderful night with family and friends, but it ended up just being ok.  too bad", 
            "this place is amazing.\n\nlocation isn't a huge factor to me.  as a local in las vegas, i avoid the strip when at all possible.  that being said, being sat at a window overlooking the bellagio fountain show is a nice view to see (no matter how many times you have seen it.)\n\nthe server (joe) was nice, funny, and informative.  he knew how to sell without selling.\n\nfirst off, bread.  with a place called scarpetta, you should expect great bread... which they have.  one of them has salami in it, and i was happy just eating that.  the bread came with olive oil, a tomato chutney-like sauce, and a pesto.  all were great, but the olive oil blew me away.  i enjoyed it so much, i bought a bottle.\n\nappetizers, i got the \"<mark>Creamy Polenta</mark>\" which turned out to be the creamiest polenta i have ever had.  it was served with mushrooms and was amazing.  my date had the roasted sea scallops.  the service size was a tad on the small size, but she seemed to enjoy it nonetheless.\n\nonto the entrees.  i'm a food network addict, and saw scarpetta while ago on \"best thing i ever ate\" where they talked about the spagetti with tomatoes and basil.  i had it, and it was good.  it wasn't the best pasta dish i have ever had, but a solid 8/10.  the pasta is fresh, and had a great texture to it.  the sauce was heavy on the basil (a good thing,) and there wasn't a ton of it weighing down the dish.  next time i go, i'll try something different.\n\nmy date had the duck and foie gras ravoli.  she seemed to be very much enjoying it, and let me have a bite.  i then understood why scott conant is looked at as this great master of italian cooking.  this dish was outstanding.  i might just get this next time i go.\n\nlastly came dessert.  i was informed there was no tiramisu on the menu (my favorite italian desert,) so we looked at the menu.  our server recommended the <mark>Coconut Panna Cotta</mark>.  my date got that, and i got the crispy sweet risotto crepes.\n\nthe only downside to the meal, i would have to say is the risotto crepes.  it isn't that they were bad, it is just that they were more like taquitos than crepes.  they were little rolled and fried pieces of batter with a sweet risotto in the middle of them.  for the amazing meal we had up to that point, it was a letdown.\n\nmy date's <mark>Coconut Panna Cotta</mark>, however, was fantastic.  it had that light and fresh taste that you want after eating a lot of pasta.\n\ni will definitely be going back, i'll just get the ravioli and <mark>Coconut Panna Cotta</mark> instead.",

            "my boyfriend recently took me here for my 23rd birthday... requested a table overlooking the bellagio fountains and the view was so beautiful! the complimentary bread basket includes 4 different breads, 3 dipping sauces, and stromboli with cheese and salami! my boyfriend ordered the stracci pasta that has lobster, crab, and shrimp- he loved it. i ordered the spaghetti and it was honestly the best spaghetti i've ever had! we decided on the <mark>Coconut Panna Cotta</mark> for dessert. it was amazing... a lot of things happening... coconut sorbet, guava juice, a cracker of some sort, some sort of creme brulee type thing, and diced pineapples. they even wrote \"happy birthday!\" on the plate and lit a candle for me. service was excellent.", 
            "let me start by saying that i've eaten at some pretty incredible places in vegas, spent a lot more money than i did here, but i absolutely enjoyed myself at scarpetta just as much at a fraction of the cost. everything was spot-on for our visit. despite having made last-minute reservations, we requested and received a booth where all four of us could see the fountains. the appetizers were amazing: we tried the <mark>Chilled Pea Soup</mark>, polenta, scallops, and short ribs. for entrees, two of us had the duck and <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark>, which i will be dreaming about for a long time; the <mark>Prime Aged Sirloin</mark>; and the spaghetti. one of us had dessert (yeah, that would be me), a <mark>Coconut Panna Cotta</mark> in a guava soup. perfect. my only complaint: the wine prices. they are, in a word, astronomical. i expect to pay double retail prices usually, maybe a bit more in vegas, but scarpetta is at least quadruple. so my husband chose beer, and i went with two glasses of wine and called it a day, rather than having to sell myself on the strip for a bottle.", 
            "if you are looking for best pasta on strip, this is the place! if you want the best view of bellagio fountain from dinning table at scarpetta, table 84 is your answer. the ambiance was quiet and intimate. it's perfect for a romantic dinner and conversation. i came here few times and never had anything i didn't like. scarpetta serves very tasty breads. don't fill yourself up with those yummies before your real food arrives! all pasta noodles here are hand made fresh. lobster pici( thick, hand-rolled pasta) is my love on pasta menu. it comes with big chunks of lobster and very tasty spiced sauce. i also really enjoy <mark>Spiced Duck Breast</mark>, mediterranean branzino and duck and <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark> from entree menu. one more thing you have to remember! save some space for deserts! <mark>Coconut Panna Cotta</mark> is a must order. it's very light and refreshing. it's a perfect way to end your dinner. i totally fall in love with scarpetta as soon as i discovered this gem on strip. i hope you will enjoy it as much as i do.", 
            "my boyfriend and i chose this restaurant as our splurge meal for the weekened becuase of the reviews it had online. the ambiance is quiet and romantic and most tables have a view of the bellagio fountains. the bread has cheese and peperoni in it, like a litte stromboli. the grapefruit gimlet was good, not the best drink i had on this trip but dinner was amazing. i asked my waiter which of three pastas he reccomended and i was suprised when he reccomened the least expensive one. it was the ricotta and truffle pasta. it was very simple but everything worked perfectly together. best passta dish i have ever had. my boyfriend the lamb loin which was perfectly cooked. we shared the <mark>Coconut Panna Cotta</mark>. i belive it was coconut and passion fruit. i would definitely reccomend the <mark>Coconut Panna Cotta</mark> and the pasta. the wait staff was friendly and just the right amount of attentive. definitely my favorite restaurant at the cosmo!", 
            "for the money, it was the best meal we had in vegas.  i went with 3 friends for my birthday (sidenote: las vegas restaurants don't really do anything special for your birthday, no free dessert, maybe a candle on the dessert you order).  we split an appetizer, ordered a bottle of wine, and all ordered one pasta.  the bread accompaniments are fantastic!  the marscapone \"butter\",  citrus infused olive oil, and tomato tapenade are delicious.  each pasta we had was spectacular.  then we each ordered a dessert (the <mark>Coconut Panna Cotta</mark> was the best, light and refreshing, and i'm usually a chocolate person when it comes to dessert).  we had an issue with the check (they presented us with a check, then when we gave our credit card to pay the amount changed, turns out they gave us the wrong check the 2nd time around, but they went back and corrected this promptly) but other than that service was flawless.  we each paid about $60 for a shared appetizer, wine, pasta, and dessert and it was the perfect amount of food (full but not stuffed).  i went to vegas for a food extravaganza (including going to sage, carnevino and joel robuchon's) and i would go back to scarpetta every night if i could do it again.  the food is wonderful and the atmosphere is modern and well-done.",

            "when i die, my heaven will include a daily dining experience at scarpetta.  my boyfriend and i absolutely loved every minute.  when i come back to vegas, i will be returning to this restaurant and having the exact same meal.  the scallop appetizer was perfectly paired with the foie gras; the beets and burrata appetizer had elements of sweet, savory, and sour (provided by the vinegarette).  but my favorite part of the meal was the simple, fresh spaghetti.  so divine.  the fresh ingredients and pasta sings in every bite.  i would eat this for breakfast lunch and dinner if i could.  <mark>Coconut Panna Cotta</mark> and bananas foster souffle to finish.  we left stuffed and happy.  ready to take on vegas!!  there is a gorgeous side view of the bellagio fountains.  however, there is a large bar that extends the entire window so it perfectly blocks your view if you sit beside the window.  why the designer would not just put floor to ceiling windows, thereby providing an uninterrupted view is beyond me.", 
            "scarpetta is a dark, intimate, upscale italian restaurant with nice views of the strip and the bellagio fountains in the distance.  we had some really good dishes here and would definitely recommend, especially if you like seafood with pasta.  service was friendly but timing a bit off with the fish coming out way before our pasta dish and them forgetting about our side dish.  still, solid 4 stars!\n\ntheir free bread basket is one of the best - nice variety of plain and some with some nice, mediterranean-inspired filling. you get a triple-dip tray of olive oil, a savory tapenade, and mascarpone! \n\nthe berry smash cocktail is sweet with the mix of blueberries and white cranberry juice.  it goes down smoothy but a few minutes you will get the buzz!  \n\nfor apps, we shared the grilled octopus. it was tender, well-seasoned of course and what made this dish a winner is that their olives and potato condiments also had a nice balanced taste. olives not too briny nor salty - just perfect.\n\ni got the branzino with saffron broth, a pretty good dish albeit on the lighter side.  it had some nice clams and shrimp pieces to go with the fish, which was cooked perfectly and seasoned enough for me.\n\nmy wife's black pasta dish with sea urchin and crabmeat however, was outstanding.  it looked super rich and tiny at first, but after mixing everything up it turned out to be very filling. best of all, it wasn't super rich.  this has got to be one of their signature dishes - why need sauce when uni and crab meat are already perfect together.\n\nfor dessert we shared the mascarpone cheesecake and greek yogurt (sorbet?).  excellent dish that easily feeds two.  we dislike dense cheesecake that tends to be too heavy and rich, but scarpetta's version was light and smooth.  it almost had a <mark>Coconut Panna Cotta</mark> texture.  the greek yogurt was sweet and chilled and reminded us more like a side of ice cream. no reason you can't make a sorbet or have greek froyo i suppose. wonderful dessert, and perfect end to a great dinner.", 
            "couldn't be more happy with my experience here. the ambiance was beautiful and we were seated at the window with a fantastic view of the bellagio. then the staff was sublime. all of them were so friendly, knowledgable, and the service they provided was top notch. our waiter matt even gave us a plate of complimentary treats to congratulate me on my graduation from nursing school. \n\nnow for the food. the drinks were great and even the bread basket was next level. the stromboli were amazing as well as the spreads for the bread. the special carpaccio was outstanding providing bursts of flavor and texture. then my <mark>Creamy Polenta</mark> with fricaseed mushrooms was out of this world life changing. my mom's squid ink pasta with crab and uni was unbelievable! and my duck and <mark>Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli</mark> was so luscious. our <mark>Coconut Panna Cotta</mark> was a wonderful way to end a fantastic meal."
