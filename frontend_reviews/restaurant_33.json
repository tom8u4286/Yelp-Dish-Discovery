            "dinner with my wife and 6 family members...no problem with reservations for this large part of a party.  service was outstanding!  we all agreed that the steaks were some of the best we had ever eaten!  <mark>Seafood Tower</mark> was very good!  sides were very tasty and the creamed corn was so good!  not sure how they prepared it, but it was some of the best ever.  will definitely include this restaurant in our future visits to las vegas!", 
            "major letdown. maybe quality of food have went down.\n\ncame here for bachelor party. had a private room. <mark>Double Cut Kurobuta Pork Chop</mark> was better than the ribeye and tbone.\n\n<mark>Pan Seared <mark>Foie Gras</mark></mark> was on menu but i didn't  care too much for. better off with bacon appetizer. quite good.\n\n<mark>Seafood Tower</mark> was lacking in quality.", 
            "first off, to make the most of your experience, you should know what to expect from delmonico service by doing your yelp homework. this place doesn't get a full 5 stars because of the service. \n\nit's been a while since i've felt so insulted by a server. i don't even know his name since he didn't introduce himself, so i know him as the big guy with a beard. he was unfriendly and wrote us off immediately when the table next to us wanted to share half of their <mark>Seafood Tower</mark> with us (it's massive and delicious by the way... thank you amazing strangers from new mexico!).\n\nwe were celebrating an anniversary and greeted warmly by the host stand, but while other yelpers say that their servers brought them a scoop of sorbet to celebrate, we got nothing. so hold your server accountable to giving you the experience you deserve for the price tag you pay. he would have gotten 30% if he wasn't such a douche.\n\nonto the food!\n- <mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark>: duh, do as all 1100 yelp reviews say and get this! fantastic marbling with an amazing crust. and yes... share a steak and order some other stuff! \n\n- <mark>Roasted Fingerling Potatoes</mark>- a light hint of rosemary and more potatoes than a patch on a farm. really tasty and beautiful. sides all seem easily shareable for four people.\n\n- <mark>Delmonico Creamed Spinach</mark>- not too heavy on seasoning, but perfectly delicious and enjoyable. perfect with the ribeye.\n\n- <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark>- if you get this, i would highly recommend sharing. it's too rich and heavy to eat a whole bowl.\n\n- penis-shaped pop-overs (as another yelp reviewer notes)- try a bite, but save room for appetizers!\n\nat the end of the day, i would certainly come back for the food. you will end up ordering too much because everything sounds delicious; next time we'll be trying bbq shrimp and truffled <mark>Truffle and Parmesan Potato Chips</mark> too!", 
            "every year a group of us (we had 6 this year) goes to vegas and tries out the various high end restaurants (and one night it's always a steakhouse).\n\nthis year we chose delmonico's steakhouse.  we enjoyed a <mark>Seafood Tower</mark> to start (fantastic) and for the main courses a few shared the chateaubriand (\"it was unbelievable!\") and others had the <mark>Ahi Tuna</mark> (\"excellent!\").  \n\nin short - it was an excellent meal!  the service was top notch, the food was great and we would all strongly recommend it.", 
            "went there for a bachelor dinner with 7 guys.the hostess was very accommodating on a sunday night as we were able to push back our reservation from 730-830 because we had too much fun earlier in the afternoon. unbelievable meal . steaks were all excellent , sides (family style) delicious and the <mark>Seafood Tower</mark> app was fresh and  adequate for the 5 of us eating seafood . one friend had the lamb chops and was very satisfied. the service was by far the best part , in all honesty . frank and his assistants were all on point . strongly recommend for a high end meal, especially if staying at venetian or the palazzo .", 
            "had dinner here last week and i have one advice - do not get the prix fix!!  we had the <mark>Seafood Tower</mark>, which was great except for the <mark><mark>Ahi Tuna</mark> and Salmon Tartare</mark> on the top - the tuna did not taste fresh at all.  some of us got the summer prix fix option, which sounded like a great deal for $65.  all the appetizers were good, especially the <mark>Heirloom Tomato Soup</mark>/grilled cheese.  then the entrees came.  i had the petite ribeye, and it was seriously the worst steak i ever had.  it tasted like cheap top sirloin from sizzler, really tough & chewy.  emeril would be ashamed if he tasted it.  my daughter ordered off the regular menu and had the <mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark>, which was delicious.  maybe it was my fault for ordering the prix fix... i understand it's cheaper... but the quality was so poor and definitely no way near $65.  i'm giving them 2 stars for good appetizers but will be staying away from the prix fix menu.", 
            "ordered the <mark>Seafood Tower</mark> at $130 came with <mark>Half Dozen Raw Oysters on the Half Shell</mark>, 2 <mark>Roasted Maine Lobster Tail</mark> split in half which were slightly overlooked and rubbery. a handful of shrimp which tasted farm raised and lacked a good wild shrimp taste. <mark><mark>Ahi Tuna</mark> and Salmon Tartare</mark> was great and the <mark>Alaskan Red King Crab Legs</mark> were great.\n\nwarm wilted spinach salad ($15) came out with a deep fried soft boiled egg and bacon with candy pecans baked on it. there was spinach in there but a 2000 calorie salad isn't really that much of a salad. still it was good.\n\nadded to that the bone in 45 day aged ribeye ($50). that was magnificent. huge, flavorful and all around award winning.  had the <mark>Delmonico Creamed Spinach</mark> ($10), creamed corn ($10) and <mark>Steak Fries</mark> ($10). the creamed corn want good. it was just bland. the rest were good.\n\nservice is exceptional. had a few tito vodka martina's with blue cheese olives as well jacob were expertly made. for 5 of us the total bill was close to $1000. be prepared to spend $$$."

            "this is my favorite steakhouse in las vegas, bar none. you can always count on emeril lagasse to deliver on his good name. we were in town for my fiance's birthday, so i jumped at the chance to make a reservation at delmonico. \n\nwe arrived about 20 mins early for our reservation. we took a seat in the lounge and waited for about 3 minutes before they came and got us to be seated. not enough time to rate the cocktail service. \n\ni started with the <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark>. creamy, hot, and with chunks of tender lobster aplenty. so flavorful, i chose to pass on the offer of fresh ground pepper. an a+ app. \n\non to main course. i had the boneless rib eye steak. i loved that the waiter asked me to cut into it in front of him to be sure it was prepared to my liking, and it was perfect! upon the first bite, time stood still. i could think of nothing but how delicious the bite in my mouth was, and how i could not wait to demolish the easily 12oz. piece of heaven in front of me. the meat had a juiciness and flavor that even the most discerning of carnivore would have to admit was the best ever. \n\nthe fiancee had the grilled filet medallions, wild mushroom crusted with emeril's worcestershire sauce, house <mark>Apple Cured Kurobuta Bone-In Bacon</mark>, and parmesan cheese. i, of course, had to have a taste of these fantastic looking medallions, and they were stellar. i especially liked the play between the slightly sweet of the worcestershire and the savory of the meat and parmesan crust. also an awesome dish. \n\ndue to the healthy portions, there was no room for dessert. we were given a sorbet on the house that was very tangy, a raspberry i believe... \n\nthe service was top notch, everything you would expect from a restaurant of this caliber. all my expectations were met, and i highly recommend stopping in for the steak of a lifetime!", 
            "hands down the best steak i've ever had. \n\nwhat an absolutely memorable experience from start to finish and a complete slam dunk on the three foodie tenets: food, service and ambiance. \n\nour waiter, frank, was friendly, hilarious and beyond helpful. his recommendations just simply rocked. the ambiance was spacious, open, modern and comfortably cozy - the dining area is huge and perfect for large group dinners. we stayed at the palazzo so it was a convenient location to head to since its in the heart of the venetian. \n\nnow here are the juicy deets on the food: \n1. tomato bisque soup with a dollop of cream: oh my goodness. so creamy and absolutely delicious\n2. filet of beef medallions: the juiciest and most tender pieces of beef you'll ever find topped with mushrooms & bread crumbs, <mark>Apple Cured Kurobuta Bone-In Bacon</mark>, parmesan cheese and a special home made sauce *insert tears of happiness* \n3. delmonico's prime hamburger: oh my oh my. served on a toasted brioche roll with cheddar cheese and bacon and accompanied by a bed of fries... this burger is unlike your average joe one. it's hearty, juicy, tender and foodgasmic. do yourselves a major favor and include this as one of your entrees. \n4. emeril's banana cream pie: after all of the steak and appetizers, my stomach was literally about to burst from fullness. however, at the taste of this pie, i was somehow able to stretch my pants to new heights and devour the whole pie. thank goodness my bf and i ordered our own desserts because he just wouldn't have gotten any otherwise. \n5. the pinot noir i ordered was the perfect complement to all of the above, taking my palette to new extremes. unfortunately, i can't remember the name, but i do remember that it was from sonoma and i ordered it by the glass. \n\nwe also had the <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> and the bbq shrimp as appetizers. while they were phenomenal as well, they were a mere 5 stars in comparison to the 6-7 star dishes above. so basically, you can't lose by ordering anything at delmonico's. \n\nhappy eating, yelpers!", 
            "everything about this place was amazing.  the food, the service, the ambiance, it couldn't have been better.  we began our meal with bbq shrimp, <mark>Apple Cured Kurobuta Bone-In Bacon</mark>, and <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark>, all of which were delicious.  now on to the steaks. we ordered <mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark> and this was by far the best steak i've ever had. it was perfectly prepared and the flavor was out of this world. for our sides we ordered saut\\u00e9ed mushrooms and grits, both of which were equally delicious.  we finished our meal with dessert and we ended up with two, the pecan pie and the caramel butter cake, both of which were, you guessed it, delicious!\n\nlet's talk about the staff and the service.  from the host that greeted us when we walked in, to the gentleman that walked us to our seats, to the three gentlemen that served us, everything and everyone was absolutely delightful.  the three gentlemen serving us were rene, brian, and david, and they ran like a well oiled machine.  they were very attentive and very pleasant people, and they helped make our dining experience so wonderful. \n\nthe ambiance was perfect for our early xmas dinner.  we had a table where we were able to comfortably eat dinner, have a conversation without screaming at each other, and we weren't wedged between other people being forced to share our dining experience with strangers. \n\ndefinitely a five star establishment with five star food and five star service. we will definitely be back."

            "las vegas...i have so many unforgettable memories...\n\ni first came to this sin city on a cold winter night with my college roommates.  the youngest of us had just turned 21 and we needed to prove we were adults.  back then, new york new york was the hottest hotel on the strip and we went crazy, imitating diana ross and the supremes (i would say we were the original \"dreamgirls\" and i have pictures to prove it).  we couldn't afford a lobster for each person, so we shared 1 among 4 of us. we were young, naive, dirt poor and shameless.  \n\nsummer in vegas is a miserable time, and my sisters and i braved that heat by looking at the bellagio water fountain in awe.  that water show is still the favorite part of my trip every time i go to vegas.  of course, this all happened before \"ocean's eleven\" featured that famous last scene.  i don't think we looked as cool as brad and george though...\n\ni swore to myself that i'd never be back to this city after our incident at a club.  we got kicked out for having too much fun!!!  it was for a bachelorette party, and i think paris hilton was slightly jealous because we drew more crowd than her performance on that night.  we continued to party on in our suite and i discovered that night that jacuzzi could make even the most prude girl hot and steamy!!!\n\ni am no longer young nor have enough energy to party all night, but vegas proved to be a great place to have some of the finest dining experiences one can enjoy.  this time, our sole purpose of the trip was to eat at delmonico steakhouse, and what a fantastic night we had!!!\n\nsome of us had been here before, so the night started with the chef's complimentary appetizer which was a capane of smoke salmon on puff pastry.  a bottle of red wine was chosen from their extensive wine list along with fried calamari and <mark>Emeril's New Orleans Barbecue Shrimp</mark> as appetizers.  i can't make a comment on the wine, but the calamari had overwhelming amount of olives for my taste.  i did love the shrimp as they were cooked perfectly in that tangy sweet bbq sauce.\n\nsome of us were disappointed that the restaurant no longer offered <mark>Double Cut Kurobuta Pork Chop</mark>, but the special of the night was pork tenderloin with braised bacon, and they happily opted for it.  a couple of us ordered a bone in filet, the bf ordered a bone in ribeye and i got a <mark>Filet Mignon</mark>.  my butterflied medium steak was perfectly charred outside with some pink inside and it was very tender and juicy.  i tasted the pork dish and i loved every part of it.  i never knew that a chunk of bacon could be so buttery and sweet, and the cane syrup they used to braise was just perfect for that white fatty meat.  the highlight of the night was the bone in ribeye.  that thing was huge with so much flavor!!!  i rarely eat any pink meat, but the bf's medium rare steak was so delicious i didn't care for the color of it.  seriously, if you ever get a chance to go to delmonico, get their bone in ribeye.  you'll thank me forever for the best steak ever!!!\n\nwe also ordered sauteed garlic mushroom and <mark>Roasted Fingerling Potatoes</mark>.  it was a mushroom heaven with all different kinds of them (shiitake, button, oyster, portebello, etc) cooked in chopped garlic and the aroma itself could make someone's mouth watery.  those purple, yellow and red potatoes side dish was recommended by our maitre d' and it didn't disappoint us.  maybe it could be too heavy for a light eater with all that meat, but for a person like me (a meat & potato girl), i couldn't ask for a better meal.\n\ni must say this steakhouse is a place to impress someone.  it's a huge restaurant, but since it was sectioned into 3 different rooms, it rather felt intimate and quaint.  small tables were cornered so you could be private and although the restaurant was busy, i never felt rushed.  the waiters were not those friendly joker types, but the service we received was more than adequate and appropriate.  \n\ndelmonico renewed my faith in vegas.  i was impressed...i was happy...i was glad to be back to vegas where i have the good, the bad and the ugly memories of my \"peak\" time!  this dining experience (not just the food) tops as one of my favorite moments in vegas.", 
            "i really enjoyed my experience in here. its an expensive place so save it for a special night out, unless you're wealthy, than feel free to splurge all you want. \n\nfrom the outside, the restaurant seems small, but once you walk in you'll see its a lot bigger and most of their clients are seated there instead. spacious seating and dim lighting, everyone is dressed up.\n\nmy party tried out:\n\nappetizer: <mark>Emeril's New Orleans Barbecue Shrimp</mark>, it wasn't bad. i was delicious, but not necessarily memorable or jaw dropping. our waiter recommended it to us and it wasn't a bad choice.\n\nsoup: <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark>, delicious!!! this is the best <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> i've had in recent memory. a lot of the bisques i've had always added too much wine into so the wine flavor killed the lobster's, but this one was well balanced! kudos!\n\nentrees: <mark>Emeril's BBQ Salmon</mark>, genuinely surprised at how delicious this was. moist, flavorful, but not overbearing. potato hash and onion strips went well with it. i ordered a side of mashed potatoes too, which was great. the waiter warned me that i had a lot of potatoes, but i don't mind. plus, i shared my mash with my party. other members in my party had the <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> and ribeye. i'm not a particular fan of ribeye because of its texture, but they managed to make me like it. \n\nwe didn't order any dessert, but we did have a few cups of blue mountain to end the evening. soothing, relaxing, and it was a perfect ending to a nice meal.\n\nthe service was great, our waiter was very efficient, honest, and attentive. no snobby elitist attitude, which is always appreciated. the price is expensive, but what do you expect? its vegas! you're going to be spending a lot if you want to have a good time here.", 
            "while staying at the palazzo in vegas during the ces & aee convention's i had a great dinner at delmonico's with a few new friends on a friday night.\nwe did not make a reservation for the 4 of us, but the maitre' d marty put a table together for us in about a 5 min wait. the place was packed!\ni guess it's the perk of being with \"high rollers\" aka \"corporate cocks\".\nno, but seriously we had unbelievable service thanks to marty's personal touch & our beautiful hostess corrine. \nour c.c's did the pleasure of doing the ordering for us ladies. i must give my c.c's credit because these 2 men had great taste!\nwe started with a very nice bottle of pinot noir, <mark>Emeril's New Orleans Barbecue Shrimp</mark>, <mark>Truffle and Parmesan Potato Chips</mark>, <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark>, a really good salad that was not on the menu per the request of my c.c friend richard.\nthe <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> was interesting, the chef bakes the lobster into a tasty biscuit that you can dip or crumble into the creamy bisque. \nwe also had <mark>Butternut Squash Ravioli</mark> both dishes brought me back to delmonico's for 2nd's on sunday night. again, i was lucky enough to have corrine as my hostess the 2nd time around. thanks corrine : )\nour main course we had a very fine bottle of cabernet not on the wine list but one of our maitre' d marty's personal fav's!\nwe each had the bone in ribeye steak's they were huge!! gigantor!!! \ni ate maybe a 1/4 of it!! \nto compliment our big juicy rib eyes we had vegetables of the day & new orleans <mark>Delmonico Creamed Spinach</mark>. d'lish!\nwe had sooo much food i thought i was going to burst!\nall though we were all stuffed some how we managed to end our meal with some coffee & dessert's,  emeril's banana cream pie (my personal fav. fyi i love cream pies ; p) & chocolate peanut butter torte. so sinful..... but not as sinful as two women in vegas baby!! \nwhat happens in vegas stay's in vegas!!!\nlet's just say our date's were not cheap and our bill was not small $$$$.", 
            "first, i want to say that it was totally cool to be able to make a reservation here via open table though yelp. it was easy and i didn't have to sign up for any additional stuff. big ups right there. i even received a confirmation email the night before (although i had already called to confirm the reservation).\n\nour server name? michael jackson. he didn't moonwalk for us but it was probably the best single display of customer service in a restaurant that i've ever had the pleasure of dining in. he was engaging, attentive, and even dropping \"kama'aina\" and a few other pidgin words upon realizing all of us were sitting there in our sig zane's (http://www.yelp.com/biz/sig-zane-designs-hilo).\n\nwe actually started with a small sampler platter that was given to us on the house because we were with our friends who lived there. i guess they like to encourage las vegas locals to come down more often. it was juicy because of the veggies on top, but the meat was a bit crisp and even more on the burnt side for me. after that we ordered the truffle oil <mark>Truffle and Parmesan Potato Chips</mark> and emeril's signature cajun <mark>Emeril's New Orleans Barbecue Shrimp</mark> appetizers. the <mark>Truffle and Parmesan Potato Chips</mark> were highly addictive and had a super rich flavor to them. add the parmesan and the saltiness was of great compliment. one of the many highlights to the evening was the shrimp appetizer. the large shrimp were wonderfully crafted with just the right amount of spices to encourage their fresh sweetness to linger.\n\ni ordered the special bone in rib eye steak. it was perfectly cooked to medium. the thing was pretty large and i finished off most of it, but coupled with everything else we ordered, it was a tall task. my good friend ordered the <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> medallions and they were spectacularly juicy and flavorful. i actually secretly wished i had ordered that instead.\n\nours sides consisted of <mark>Potato Gratin</mark>, caramelized seasonal onions, and <mark>Creamed Corn Gratine</mark>. they all were excellent in their own right. my friend described the <mark>Potato Gratin</mark> as the single best dish of <mark>Potato Gratin</mark> he has ever had. myself, i thought that the seasonal onions were spectacularly sweet. they blew my mind and i almost loaded up on those alone. the <mark>Creamed Corn Gratine</mark> was also sweet, but it wasn't as good as the other two. although, two spectacular sides out of three isn't too shabby.\n\noverall, it was a great spending time with good friends over an excellent meal in addition to the wonderful service. it was worth every expensive penny i could slam on the credit card. i would easily recommend to anyone the experience. reservations are highly recommended. one last note, we even got a hand-written thank you postcard less than a week later from michael. that was really nice.", 
            "not bad but there are more exciting dining adventures to be had in vegas.\n\nthe <mark>Emeril's New Orleans Barbecue Shrimp</mark> and <mark>Creole Boiled Gulf Shrimp Cocktail</mark> are great starters but the strong spice flavor do not pair well with wines.\n\nsince this place bills itself as a steakhouse, i thought i should give them a try.  the steaks are quality cuts and well aged but the subtle flavors that develop with aging are lost because of the creole seasoning.  once again, the seasoning does not pair well with most traditional steak wines.  try a full bodied red zin.\n\nservice is excellent.  prices are ok.  wine prices are also fair by vegas standards.\n\nunlike most restaurants, lunch is not a better deal than dinner.  prices are the same, you just have fewer choices.\n\nstill though, there is little wrong with delmonico.  well worth a try.",

            "our last night in vegas & my daughter & i went to delmonico for dinner.  the service was tops, our waiter frank was the best!  we had the <mark>Emeril's New Orleans Barbecue Shrimp</mark> appetizer-excellent!  so tasty and the sauce--so good!  my daughter ordered the ny sirloin and i ordered the <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark>.  the steak was superb; like cutting butter and seasoned perfectly.  unfortunately, i became suddenly ill totally unrelated to the food and had to leave for a bit.  when i returned frank, our waiter seemed quite concerned and brought me a club soda.  sadly i wasn't able to eat my meal or have the banana cream pie i had dreamed about sharing with my daughter.  i was not charged for my bisque or the club soda; which i really expected to pay for.  the care and courtesy extended to me was so appreciated!  emeril should be proud of your employees especially frank!  thank you all so much!!!", 
            "this time, for dinner, emeril's employees took it up a notch, and diane and i enjoyed a five-star dining experience here.  we were initially served an amuse bouche of bruschetta, tomato, mozzarella, & balsamic followed by an ordered starter of <mark>Emeril's New Orleans Barbecue Shrimp</mark> that came with a light petite rosemary buttermilk biscuit and strong, heavy bbq sauce.\n\nwhile diane enjoyed a bowl of <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> with maine lobster garnish, i savored the vibrant contrasting flavors of <mark>Traditional New Orleans Gumbo</mark> with shrimp & andouille sausage.  then it was time for our mains.\n\nwhile diane worked on a petite filet without char, i applied myself to a 9-ounce lightly charred <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> cooked perfectly medium rare as ordered, with a large pat of maitre d' butter melting slowly over the top.  both steaks came with classic yorkshire pudding, which tasted best after being rubbed in meat juices that ran slightly on the plate.  the meat melted in the mouth, aided by dipping in either a quite tasty homemade worcestershire sauce or drinkable b\\u00e9arnaise sauce.  i also topped my towering rectangle of beef with a side of sauteed garlic wild mushrooms, which included multiple varieties.  we also shared a large side of very cheesy and crusty <mark>Potato Gratin</mark>.\n\nfor dessert, for us there was no choice.  it was foreordained.  no one makes banana cream pie better than emeril lagasse!  one slice of emeril's banana cream pie was easily enough for both me and my spouse to share.  together we delighted in this rich confection of ripe banana chunks set in layers like a brick wall with sweet cement, and adorned with chocolate shavings, whipped cream, and caramel sauce.  mellow decaffeinated arabica coffee served in a french press just further enhanced the end of this fine meal.  seating was very comfortable in a half-booth, and service was both professional and knowledgeable. \n\nwe will surely return for more of the same!", 
            "we came here for my husbands birthday dinner.  we were a few minutes early so had drinks in the lounge, a tale of two cherries and louisiana hard tea.  drinks were good and packed a punch.  we started with <mark>Emeril's New Orleans Barbecue Shrimp</mark> and fried green tomatoes.  <mark>Emeril's New Orleans Barbecue Shrimp</mark> was the same as at emeril's other restaurants.  delicious.  i only wish you got more then 4 shrimp and 1 tiny biscuit.  the fried green tomatoes were one of the nights specials.  they were topped with lump crap and fried light and crisp.  for our entrees i got emeril's barbecue salmon, he got bone in ribeye.  we chose twiced <mark>Baked Idaho Potato</mark> and grits for our sides.  salmon and steak were both wonderful and cooked perfectly.  the sides were creamy and rich, but very similar in flavor.  we loved them both but probably should have order something with more variety.  we finished with banana cream pie and caramel butter cake for dessert.  the banana cream pie is emeril's signature dessert that is served in all his restaurants.  hubby loves it and it's a must order for us.  it was our first time ordering the caramel butter cake and it didn't disappoint.  it was served warm and covered in gooey caramel.  service started off slow, but got better as the meal went on.  we had incorrect charges on our bill that were quickly corrected when we brought it to our servers attention."

            "tip on ordering steak:\nif you want a bigger cut of meat, get it rare to medium-rare.  \notherwise, if you order your meat medium-well, you get a smaller cut in order for it to cook well in the middle\n\ni couldn't decide on a steak that night, and i wanted a little variety.  so i ordered a combination of 2 appetizers and a soup.\n\nsoup: <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> was awesome mainly because they weren't stingy with the lobster meat.  often when you order a seafood soup (e.g. clam chowder) they dump a lot of potatoes or other filling in there.  not the case with this bisque.  a must for any bisque or lobster connoisseur.\n\nappetizer 1: <mark>Butternut Squash Ravioli</mark> w/duck was very tasty, and again, not stingy with the duck, which kind of looked like pulled pork but with duck meat.\n\nappetizer 2: crawfish meat w/crystal pepper sauce over linguine could have been a small meal in itself.  and just the right amount of that crystal hot sauce to give it a solid southern kick.  this was probably my favorite.\n\ni did have a taste of the various meats too including the t-bone and <mark>Filet Mignon</mark>, both of which i recommend.  you don't get anything with it, so unless you just want meat, you'll probably need to order a side dish or two.", 
            "incredible service! made a reservation even though it was after 4th of july weekend. i was glad we had one, it was still packed on a monday night! there were eight of us, my friend's daughter brought her new build a bear puppy, and the server brought a setting and high chair for the puppy! how cute is that?? we ordered a bunch of appetizers, the fried calamari was light and crisp, bbq shrimp's sauce was thick and sweet but yet savory, <mark>Creole Boiled Gulf Shrimp Cocktail</mark> should be named prawn cocktail, and the <mark>Butternut Squash Ravioli</mark> - again, it's the sauce that did it, yum. every time i see <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark>, i order it for the kids, they love it - creamy, velvety with chunks of lobsters. hubby had the ribeye steak, i had the <mark>Filet Mignon</mark>, took a bite of my friends' beef medallion and <mark>Colorado Rack of Lamb</mark>. i think the ribeye steak and lamb came out the winner. very juicy and tender, with a little bit burnt on the fat, perfection! we shared the banana cream pie, banana pudding, creme brulee for desserts. the pudding was no doubt the winner, the others are good, but if you can only order one, have the pudding. again, expensive, but money well spent. will come back again for sure!", 
            "as a restaurant under emeril lagasse's name, i was expecting a consistent, quality meal.  instead, i left very disapointed with the restaurant.  the only highlight was the signature bbq shrimp appetizer.  the <mark>Butternut Squash Ravioli</mark> with duck confit were unexplainably dry.  the shredded duck on top should be slightly dry or crispy, but the inside of the raviolis shouldn't be.  i don't know if i could even say the butternut squash was pasty.  so dry it was bordering on gritty.   \n\nthe <mark>Truffle and Parmesan Potato Chips</mark> were cut ultra thin and so tasty, but were dripping with too much oil.  instead of tasting light and airy, they felt weighed down by goopy oil drops that clung to each chip.  \n\nthen there's the steak.  we ordered one bone in ribeye and a standard ribeye.  both cuts were juicy, marbled nicely and cooked to the right levels, except for one thing, the steak had no taste.  what creates the taste, seasoning and aging?  well, whatever it was, it was only surface deep.  the outer portion of the steak was seasoned, but the meat in the middle really had no taste.  even the butter scoop that topped the steak couldn't make a noticeable difference.    \n\ndon't get me wrong, the meat quality was good, but if i pay $50 for a steak, i expect flavor.  it felt like i was eating a $25 steak.   i almost wanted to ask them for bernaise sauce to get me through it.  even though the wait staff was extremely helpful and attentive, it couldn't save this disappointing meal.   \n\nin vegas the only other steakhouse i've been to is n9ne at the palms and i would recommend that over delmonico's in a heartbeat.   i don't think i'll be going back.",

            "this was a dinner for work.. not sure if i'd pay for it on my own dime, but it was excellent! service was excellent. the sommelier even happily took back a $120 bottle of wine (guess that's cheap by vegas standards!) when the 2nd bottle smelled corked. \n\nappetizers:\n*<mark>Butternut Squash Ravioli</mark> - recommended if you love duck! covered in duck confit.. yummy!\n*bbq shrimp - sauce was rich, heavy and delish. it was almost a combination of a gumbo base and bbq sauce\n*<mark>Pan Seared <mark>Foie Gras</mark></mark> with berry tart (on the daily specials menu) - wow! if you follow my reviews, you know i'm a <mark>Pan Seared <mark>Foie Gras</mark></mark> lover, but this one was really excellent. the crossed grill marks on it were beautiful\n\nmain course:\n*bone in ribeye - 18 oz of buttery tasty goodness. well seasoned. not best steak i've had in my life material, but quite good.\n*<mark>Ahi Tuna</mark> - huge portion! cooked to perfection, but the enormous slabs were kind of off putting. i guess when you're paying $42 for freaking tuna you should get something substantial. plus it makes you feel more like your steak eating companions to have this retarded big portion on your plate.\n\nsides:\n*just get the <mark>Truffle and Parmesan Potato Chips</mark>.. you will thank me later!\n*grits covered in bacon couldn't get more fatty :) no complaints here\n\ndessert:\n*chocolate bread pudding - very chocolatey!\n*butterscotch pudding - good but honestly the freebie portion at bradley ogden is yummier!!",

            "simply delicious!\n\ni went with a group from work while attending a meeting and everyone seemed impressed with the food. we started off with a few appetizers including the calamari which was a little on the salty side, roasted <mark>Butternut Squash Ravioli</mark> with duck and the crab cakes. \n\ni had the spinach and radicchio salad with apple rosemary vinaigrette and warm pistachio crusted goat cheesecake. yep, that's right, you heard me... a goat cheese cake. it was fantastic. \n\nfor my entr\\u00e9e i was worried because i had already filled up on the appetizers and my delicious salad but i managed to eat my <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> medallions with a bacon peppercorn sauce.  we split a few sides as a table including the broccoli, asparagus and some delicious corn dish. i have no idea who ordered it but for the love of all that is holy, you have to get this corn dish. it was phenomenal. the broccoli not so much... too al dente for me!\n\nfor dessert there were a few orders of the bread pudding and banana cream pie which no one seemed to complain about. the service was a little slow but maybe it was because the place was packed. there was way too much time in between courses. oh and it took at least 30 minutes to get drinks each round. maybe go early before the rush hits or just don't go with a party of 13 like we did.", 
            "another large group dinner with the co-workers, this time we selected delmonico steakhouse.  wow, i am impressed.  this is what i call classy.  i didn't even realize this was an emeril lagasse restaurant until i examined the doggie bag afterward!\n\nthe food is top notch, i ordered the <mark>Butternut Squash Ravioli</mark> (sans duck confit) and the wild arugula w/ raspberries.  both dishes were just the right size (not too big, not too small), beautifully presented, perfectly seasoned and dressed, and absolutely delicious.\n\nwe ordered and shared the green apple crisp a la mode for dessert, i might have loved it more if i was still hungry, but i was so stuffed that i couldn't properly enjoy it.  note to self: next time, dessert first!\n\nliterally, there was not a single bite leftover from anyone's plate.\n\nin regards to the service, our server jen was such a sweetheart, she seemed like a friend right from the start.  not too intrusive, but relaxed and attentive.  very accommodating and down to earth.\n\nmust try items: homemade <mark>Truffle and Parmesan Potato Chips</mark> with parmesan, truffle oil and scallions.  i was stuffing my face like no tomorrow and scraping the plate clean...the warm dinner rolls w/ butter...they smelled so buttery!  lastly, the corn gratin, the panko topping was so crispy, it was unreal, the gratin underneath was hot, steamy, and sweet from the crisp fresh corn.  sooo goood!\n\nall in all, this place was expensive, but none of the staff had to overdo it to impress us, the atmosphere, food and service spoke for itself, so it was worth every penny.\n\nlove", 
            "i know i know.  the veg is only giving 2 stars to the steakhouse.\n\ni wanted to like it, i did.\n\non our girls-weekend to vegas, one gal requested at least one nice steak dinner.  so we did some research and ended up here.  seated promptly at our reservation time on a friday night after sitting only a few minutes in their version of a waiting room.\nas others have mentioned, when you order a steak ... that's what you get.  not a piece of parsley to garnish, nothin' else is on that plate.  our lil steak girl said her $45 steak was .... ok.  but, and i quote, she'd had a steak with more flavor at a certain aussie steak chain.  girl who ordered the chicken dish loved it and said it was worth the money.  the $9 side of mashed potatoes was yummy.  little veg here ordered their vegetable plate (not on the menu, but when i asked what was available, our waiter offered this) and it cost me $30.  for grilled veggies - carrots, two types of onion, asparagus, and .... something else.  not even squash!  a <mark>Butternut Squash Ravioli</mark> was on the menu, but not being served that night.\nloud, no bathroom inside (have to walk around the corner in the casino), and there was no decor to the place.  maybe that's a style, but it ain't mine.\nthe wine list is waaay extensive, almost to a fault.\nservice was overwhelming in that we had four separate waiters, but chaotic.  and it was 40 minutes from ordering to getting our food.\nlast complaint - if you have a nice restaurant, insist on some kind of basic dresscode.  i don't want to have spent time looking nice and then sit next to a table full of rednecks in tasmanian devil cartoon shirts.\nsorry, but it isn't worth the money for herbivores or carnivores.", 
            "i'm not a big emeril fan and i didn't like table 10 when i ate there. but, i was craving a good steak and crab cake so i crossed my fingers and made reservations for my birthday dinner. when we checked in with the hostess she wished me a happy birthday and, after waiting a few minutes in the lounge, seated us at a table tucked away in a corner of a room that was off of the main dining area. typically when my wife and i go out to eat we get stuck at the crappiest 2-top the restaurant has to offer. but this time around we were at a nice, big, four person table in a low-traffic area in the quietest part of the restaurant.\n\nnow, on to the food...\n//appetizers//\n* jumbo lump crab cake - a single crab cake with fennel, tomato and an herb salad on top. the crab cake was sitting on a slightly tangy, tartar-like herb emulsion. while it tasted delicious it just can't compare to real jumbo lump crab cakes from baltimore. the delmonico crab cake consisted of crab mixed with a binding element that tasted like a mayonaise based mix. personally, i prefer crab cakes with little else other than crab and some old bay. but, for a crab cake outside of maryland, this one was still very good.\n\n* roasted <mark>Butternut Squash Ravioli</mark> - the ravioli, sitting in a sage brown butter sauce, was excellent. the shredded duck on top of the ravioli was excellent. but, the pairing seemed slightly odd and unnecessary. sure, eating the two together was a sweet and savory delight that gave my taste buds a happy ending but i think the ravioli was good enough to stand on its own. the duck was a little overkill on a dish that was already fabulous.\n\n//amuse bouche//\n* shrimp dumpling - our apps were served so quickly that they came out before the amuse bouche, which the waitress brought out as we started digging in to the appetizers. this may not have been proper protocol, but we still appreciated the additional dish. the waitress called it a shrimp dumpling, but it was fried like a fried wanton. whatever you want to call it, it was served with a yuzu sauce and cucumber. it was a tasty bite -- a touch of acidity and tartness with some crunch -- but it felt out of place. i thought delmonico was a southern restaurant... what are they doing serving a heavily inspired asian dish?\n\n//entree//\n<mark>Filet Mignon</mark> with a side of sauteed garlic wild mushrooms - we weren't all that hungry so we split the entree. they didn't mind splitting the steak before it was served to us. when it came out each was on it's own plate with a small piece of butter resting on top (health food this is not). we ordered it medium rare, but it came out closer to rare. no problem, i don't mind a little blood. their steaks have a creole seasoning rub that makes for a strong peppery taste (they definitely kicked it up a notch). it's unique compared to the taste of other steaks around town and while it was a touch too salty, the filet was so tasty and tender that it didn't matter. the mushrooms were pure buttery, garlicky awesomeness. a great accompaniment to the filet.\n\n//dessert//\n* banana rum sorbet - with all the other stuff we ate we were feeling full so this light, complimentary dessert was perfect -- at least in theory. it's flavor was too subtle and bland, but still a decent way to cleanse the palate. it was free after all, so i shouldn't complain. the final thing served was a plate of mignardises -- while none were spectacular, they provided a deliciously sweet ending to a great meal.\n\ni only glanced at the wine list, as my wife and i only got a couple wines by the glass. but, in flipping through their extensive list i saw plenty of bottles priced well below $100. some as low as $40. so, it looked like they had something for everyone, no matter what your price range.\n\nthe service was top notch. we were waited on by two people who were very attentive, constantly checking if we liked everything, needed anything, and refilling drinks. it was odd how quick everything was served. our apps came out within 10 minutes of ordering (before the amuse) and our entree came out right after we finished our apps. everything seemed so fast-paced. on the way out the hostesses again wished me a happy birthday. this was some of the best service i've gotten at any restaurant in vegas.\n\nthe atmosphere felt like an upscale restaurant, of course, with it's wine room, stone wall (on one side), and vaulted ceilings. but, the white walls looked so bare. a touch of paint could do wonders. even adding more flair would make it more comforting and welcoming. my favorite thing about the decor was probably the chairs. they're large leather chairs that were so comfy. perfect seating for a steakhouse, in contrast to the office chair seating at cut.\n\ni wasn't expecting to be blown away by delmonico, but every aspect of my dining experience was as good as any other steakhouse i've been to in this city.\n\n4.5 stars", 
            "i came here back in 2005 with my family and had a phenomenally memorable meal. six years later -- i came back this past weekend and it was stellar. extensive wine list, excellent service, ridiculously buttery brioche bread, great cocktails, and of course, the food!\n\nfor apps, my party had the <mark>Truffle and Parmesan Potato Chips</mark> (so rich but delish!), <mark>Butternut Squash Ravioli</mark> with duck confit (superb), <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> (mmm with large lobster chunks), and the wedge salad (as perfect as a classic wedge gets). \n\nfor entrees, i had the <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> that was perfectly cooked to a true medium-rare. i often find that, when i order med-rare, more often than not, highly rated restaurants overcook my meat to more of a med to med-well, which is can be disappointing. well, here at delmonico, it was perfect! friends got the <mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark> and the huge $85 fred flinstone steak (i forget the official name), all cooked to perfection. the 2007 joseph phelps cab paired divinely with the steaks. \n\nsides:  creamed corn was mind-blowing; <mark>Delmonico Creamed Spinach</mark> was good but didn't knock my socks off (compared to everything else which did). \n\nwe were too stuffed to order a dessert, but we received a complimentary birthday gelato. nice gesture, but it was not so great -- i think it was a non-conventional flavor, like fennel or something?\n\noverall, i would definitely return the next time i'm in the mood for a (pricey) steak dinner in vegas!!! emeril is a genius!",

(i don't see it on the menu, so it must be a special)\n- my husband cleaned his plate.\n\nwe also ordered two desserts:\n1. delmonico chocolate layer cake - chocolate pudding, coconut ice cream and\ntoasted almonds\n- looked delicious.  they said it was good and the coconut ice cream was amazing!\n\n2. pecan pie with oatmeal shortbread crust french, vanilla ice cream & caramel sauce\n- pie was in the shape of a circle, so the center was ooey and gooey and yummy!!  very good!\n\nprice was about $300+ for the table (not including tip).\n\nthe service was outstanding!  we actually had 3 people waiting on us and never had to ask for anything.  they were on-point with re-filling the water at the table!  it was so nice to never have to look around for someone to help us.  the timing of everything was beautiful.\n\nwe even got an amuse-bouche bruschetta when we were deciding what to have for dinner.  what a nice surprise!!", 
            "2012 fall restaurant week lunch #2. \n\nwhether you're visiting delmonico on a regular night, special occasion, or during restaurant week as i did, from the amazing lunch i had with extraordinary service and exceptional food, i'd recommend it to anyone. 4.5 stars at least.\n\nwe seem to be the first party seated for lunch. our two servers worked well together, being knowledgeable, catering, and attentive from beginning to end. even as more customers started to come in and they had more to attend to, they still did an amazing job making sure we were taken care of.\n\nwhat we put in our tummies:\n(pictures posted)\n\n1st course\ntraditional new orleans\nchicken & andouille sausage gumbo\n\n2nd course\n<mark>Butternut Squash Ravioli</mark>\nprime cheeseburger w/ bacon\n\n3rd course\nemeril's banana cream pie\npecan pie\n\ni'm no expert on gumbo, but i found it very tasty. still steaming in individual serving pots, it was poured over rice table-side. very nice touch. the burger was an enormous 11oz, well-seasoned, cooked medium as requested, hearty and meaty as burgers should be. fries were just...fries. it was my first experience with <mark>Butternut Squash Ravioli</mark>, and i loved it. sage brown butter, toasted hazelnuts, and parmesan cheese made these raviolis sweet and flavorful.\n\nthe highlight of the food was unquestionably the desserts. i never order banana cream pie, but i'm a big believer in trying whatever is the signature item, especially when it's written \"emeril's banana cream pie.\" i'm sure it's not made very traditionally, but oh my gosh. made with sweet bananas, the pie filling felt more like a cheesecake. topped with chocolate shavings, amazing crust, this dessert will be what i think of from this day forward when anyone says banana cream pie. you think the way i described it, how could the pecan pie even compete?! well, it did! served warm and moist, it was decadent and comforting.\n\ni was beginning to wonder if the restaurant week event and menus were affecting my experiences at these places i've been eagerly wanting to try. i was very excited to participate, awaiting delicious gourmet food at a great price at a fine-dining establishment, helping a worthy cause. \n\npersonally, i'm very happy to say delmonico made me want to become a repeat customer, again and again. it's so hard not to give 5 stars, but i would want to experience dining here on a non-restaurant week to confidently say it was as amazing as i remembered this lunch. \n\ni'm very much looking forward to coming back. and soon!", 
            "the bone-in rib eye is easily the highlight of this steakhouse. the medium rare steak had excellent flavor along with the marbled fat that simply melted in my mouth. the oysters, <mark>Ahi Tuna</mark> & <mark><mark>Ahi Tuna</mark> and Salmon Tartare</mark>, <mark>Butternut Squash Ravioli</mark>, and bbq shrimp are all excellent choices for starters and the <mark>Potato Gratin</mark> is a good side dish to have the steak with. the wine list is very extensive, but if you're not up for all that intensive reading, they also have a very knowledgeable staff to make recommendations. i was a little disappointed with peppermint profiteroles which were a little too stiff for my liking. service was great and efficient. i must have had my water glass filled 7-8 times that night. pricing is relatively decent - entrees around $50 and starters/sides/deserts around $10-$15 each.", 
            "came here for lunch during restaurant week with a few other yelpers. it's located in the venetian, but it's easier if you self park at palazzo to find it. if you self park, you have to walk through the entire hotel to get to restaurant row, which is where delmonico's is located.\ni was the first to arrive so i sat in the bar area, which was very cozy. before long, we were seated at our table. the restaurant had a few others dining in there but it wasn't busy at all.\nthere were 3 waiters servicing our table. one for water, one to clear and one to serve. maybe not specifically, but it seemed that way. \nthe chef sent over a complimentary appetizer for the table; lemon ricotta served over thinly sliced red apple and bruschetta with tapenade and pesto. (i think a green apple would have been much better. i dont care for the texture nor the taste of red apples) the appetizer was very nice. the soup followed and i didnt care for that one bit. it tasted like warm ketchup. ew. ew, ew, ew. so not a fan. thankfully, that was the only dish i didn't care for. the grilled cheese that accompanied the soup was very good. i enjoyed that quite a bit. the <mark>Vine-Ripened Heirloom Tomato Salad</mark> and the house green salad that others ordered looked absolutely delicious. every one finished everything, so i guess they liked it too.\nthe salmon entree was delicious. i asked for it cooked well done and it came back, cooked fantastically! it wasn't medium at all and it was so juicy. even christina who likes hers cooked much less, said it was very good. i tried her <mark>Butternut Squash Ravioli</mark>. it was ok. the flavor in the ravioli was good, but it 1. should have been warmer and 2. the pasta was too soft. it should have been al dente. \nthe dessert was good as well. your choice between banana cream pie or pecan pie. i opted for the pecan. it was served with vanilla ice cream and whipped cream. it was good too. i tried christina's banana cream pie, and it tasted good, although i didn't care for the look of it, with all those squares of banana. \nthe service was very good, they didn't add the 18% automatically (i prefer when places do that, honestly). the food was good, not great, but good. the price, $30.13 for 3 courses was ok. it was \"pricey\" for lunch, however, the quality of the food and the portions were generous.\ni dont really see myself going back there. there are a lot of other places i'd like to try and places that i love already that i will return to. it was a great time with great people!",

            "as vegas steakhouses go, delmonico is a fine choice. i've been there twice and both times i've had very good meals. with that said, meeting expectations at this high price point is challenging, and particularly on my most recent visit i'm afraid delmonico should have been even better. this year we had a large company dinner at delmonico, so i was able to try lots of dishes. \n\nwe started with the bbq shrimp and the <mark>Butternut Squash Ravioli</mark>. the shrimp was good but a little overcooked. the squash was on the rich side but really tasty - you couldn't have but so many so it is good that they list it as an appetizer rather than as a pasta main. i loved one or two but a plateful would've been too much.  i also tried the <mark>Truffle and Parmesan Potato Chips</mark>, which were wonderful but extremely truffley. \n\nthe <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> was textbook, exactly what <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> is supposed to be - rich and creamy with chunks of tender lobster meat. still i might have preferred my neighbor's <mark>Vine-Ripened Heirloom Tomato Salad</mark>, which i tried and thought was one of the highlights of the meal.  i didn't try it but the duck from the smoked duck salad was not well received by another of my colleagues. \n\nfor my entr\\u00e9e i had the delmonico signature steak - a <mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark>. this is where the meal fell down ever so slightly. the steak was fine but for the premium price it should have been exceptional and it definitely wasn't. my order of medium rare was barely pink at all and was probably served on the dark side of medium, and i thought the meat was surprisingly devoid of flavor. don't get me wrong - it was a fine steak, but it was average among the steaks i've had in las vegas, at all price points. one of my close work friends who has frequented delmonico for years ordered the same cut at the dinner and he agreed that for his steak too it was an off-night. of the sides i loved the creamed corn. next time i'd do the mashed potatoes over the scalloped potatoes, which i found undercooked and under seasoned. the asparagus was also fine but unspectacular. \n\nthe bread pudding was great and the key lime pie (or was it cheesecake?) was nice too, but i'll reserve my sweetest accolades for the banana cream pie. best bite of the night. one of the best i've had. wonderful.",

            "yes yes yes! i'm probably repeating all the great things people said already but it is true. my husband and i were there this past weekend and we were satisfied 100%! and after reading the reviews i'm not sure why people minus the 5th star because of the price. in my opinion if you are looking for an amazing fine dining experience you must be wiling to spend the money. we were here for about three hours and we enjoyed every bit of it. we let our waiter know in advance that we were in no rush and he made sure to plan the timing of our appetizers and main just right. we were watching the blue man group after dinner and wanted to drink a few drinks before we left.\n\nevery time we went to the bathroom they folded our napkins, refilled our drinks before we even had time to ask, and our waiter was extremely knowledgeable about the menu --- that alone just shows the attention to detail. in addition to the <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark>, french escargot, cream <mark>Creamed Corn Gratine</mark>, creole gulf shirmp cocktail...:) i had the hot <mark>Alaskan Red King Crab Legs</mark> and my husband had the bone in ribeye. he said \"it is the best steak he has ever had\" ( please take in consideration that we had travel all over the world).  the noise was moderate, besides i'm in vegas and i wanted to dine in a lively and happy place not a quiet boring place.  even though the dining room was open it is still cozy and romantic and easy to have a private conversation.  \n\nit has become one of our favorite places to go and we will definitely come back again!", 
            "my wife took me here for a fabulous dinner before the blue man group show.  we got there in plenty of time and explained that we wanted to sit and enjoy our experience and planned on being there for awhile.  we were told that it was no problem and they were happy to have us as long as we like.  we were never once rushed or pushed out like at a lot of places just trying to turn tables even though we were there 2-3 hours.  the service was amazing but not to the point where you were harrassed...our drinks were never empty and plates never sat long but it seems we never noticed the waiter coming and going which is awesome.  we took our time with drinks, appetizers, and dinner and all were timed perfectly and served when we were ready.  the food was amazing as well!  i had the escargot and the <mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark> which was the best steak i have ever had!  i have had a lot of steaks from so called steakhouses and top recommended restaurants, this is definitely tops!  my wife had the <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> and <mark>Alaskan Red King Crab Legs</mark> which were also absolutely delicious.  the prices are higher, but it goes directly with the service and quality of food and i have no problem paying for what we got.  we will definitely go back...now if we could only catch emeril there!", 
            "went here over the past weekend just to try. have been to other steakhouses like cut, ruth cris, morels, summit house in fullerton, and lawrys. safe to say food was decent considering the price. \n\nfilet mingnon was tender but good. not great. i have liked the filet at cut much better. \n\n<mark>Alaskan Red King Crab Legs</mark> were bland but amazingly precut and offered at either a cold or hot temperature. \n\nthe <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> was ok too. i think i had expected the greatness i found with mccormick's <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark>. safe to say for the price i would probably go to cut again or lawrys or mccormick. probably wouldn't want to go back here. sorry kids. but that's just me.", 
            "ordered the <mark>Seafood Tower</mark> at $130 came with <mark>Half Dozen Raw Oysters on the Half Shell</mark>, 2 <mark>Roasted Maine Lobster Tail</mark> split in half which were slightly overlooked and rubbery. a handful of shrimp which tasted farm raised and lacked a good wild shrimp taste. <mark><mark>Ahi Tuna</mark> and Salmon Tartare</mark> was great and the <mark>Alaskan Red King Crab Legs</mark> were great.\n\nwarm wilted spinach salad ($15) came out with a deep fried soft boiled egg and bacon with candy pecans baked on it. there was spinach in there but a 2000 calorie salad isn't really that much of a salad. still it was good.\n\nadded to that the bone in 45 day aged ribeye ($50). that was magnificent. huge, flavorful and all around award winning.  had the <mark>Delmonico Creamed Spinach</mark> ($10), creamed corn ($10) and <mark>Steak Fries</mark> ($10). the creamed corn want good. it was just bland. the rest were good.\n\nservice is exceptional. had a few tito vodka martina's with blue cheese olives as well jacob were expertly made. for 5 of us the total bill was close to $1000. be prepared to spend $$$."

            "so mr food network himself emeril has his own steak house. \none thing i know - is my steaks. mmmmm dry aged bone in rib eye....here just waiting to enter my watering mouth and be consumed by my emotional grinding of my mandibles.\nhow can i forget - truffle oil <mark>Truffle and Parmesan Potato Chips</mark>.  popping my truffle oil cherry....yum\nok i've never had fancy schmancy gumbo. but here it was very pleasant and chic. i mean come on - gumbo - i want pieces of meat and seafood and okra.....\nbone in rib eye - no more done than medium rare. doesn't need any extra spices or sauces give me my meat plain. if i wanted it coated with jism. well i can do it myself :)\nsteamed or grilled asparagus with hollandaise...mmmmm\ni ate a lot...so i didn't have dessert like everyone else did. if i could i would have sucked on the bones. but that would have been a culinary faux paus. bad myke no sucking.....so how do they make the thick steak so dark and perfectly medium rare? hmm...it's gotta be keebler elves performing magic.\nthe service is impeccable. i went to the bathroom and put my napkin on my chair - just to find it folded neatly on my table.  can we say fancy feast?", 
            "my boss reccomended delmonico's to me in a serious way, so when i had a chance to go to vegas with some big foodies, i immediately suggested we try it out. we made reservations for 10:00pm on the friday we were all scheduled to arrive. we were all coming seperately from different airlines and different cities and planned to meet at the airport and head out. i. was. pumped. super damn excited. \n\nand then my flight was delayed. i hate southwest-- this is what happens when you try to be cheap but still end up paying $250 to fly for half an hour from la to vegas. my flight was delayed and delayed and i started to really worry. i worried in the terminal while i nervously sipped my venti coffee. (i swear i had ordered a tall?) i worried for the two hours i spent sitting on the plane on the runway, trying with much difficulty to bury my face in harry potter 7 while i sat next to a really annoying and \"overly affectionate\" couple. (seriously... don't do that. wtf!? have you no decency!?! where the fuck is your mother!??!)\n\ni landed at 10:00, booked it to the cab line, sprinted through the venetian in heels, and, sweaty, restless, tired, and uncomfortable with my carry-on bag, met my friends at the bar in delmonico's at 10:20. my entire excursion from my house in los angeles to the restaurant in vegas took 4 hours. i'm pretty sure i could have driven. i wanted to die.\n\nwas it worth it?\nyes it was.\n\ngrey goose and tonic: strong enough to keep me from death type of worth it.\nbeer and cheese fondue with pretzel bread: salty-cheesy goodness type of worth it.\noysters rockefeller: i don't even like oysters and it was worth it.\n<mark>Truffle and Parmesan Potato Chips</mark>: the light, crispy, addicting type of worth it.\nsalad with fresh fried mozzarella: i want to eat this cheese until i gain 400 pounds and have to be air-lifted out of my house type of worth it.\ndry grilled aged sirlion a la oscar with blue crab: i was so full at this point i could only eat two bites of this and it was still worth it.\nthree different attentive waiters: i get a little chill when waiters murmur \"pardon my reach\" under their breath like it's a secret type of worth it.\n\nthe menu looked expensive (around $50 for entrees) but our table, for 4 people with a half bottle of wine, cocktails, entrees for each, soups/slads, and appetizers came out to around $400. it was pretty reasonable for the volume and quality of food we ate, but, really now, $400 is spendy. i won a little bit of money over the weekend, so now i can afford to go back. and i will be back!", 
            "hmm.  i can't put my finger on why, but i just wasn't blown away by delmonico.  the food and service were both certainly good, but....i don't know....something was lacking.  it may have been the atmosphere.  everything seemed very bland and sort of old - for instance, the leather dining chairs all had cracks <mark>Truffle and Parmesan Potato Chips</mark> in them, which isn't what i expect from a place of this caliber.  i guess it just wasn't a very special experience.", 
            "boyfriend and i came here with two other friends as an early bday celebration!\n\nthe restaurant is right next to the passageway to the palazzo hotel and it sits right in front of the blue man theater. the ambience was nice except i took off a star for the boring cream colored walls. \n\nthe food was great! i had a <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> while the other three all had a bone in ribeye. ohmigosh...i couldn't believe how big these things were! they were ginormous! anyway, the sides were yummy! we had the <mark>Sauted Garlic Mushrooms</mark>, steamed asparagus, <mark>Baked Idaho Potato</mark>, <mark>Truffle and Parmesan Potato Chips</mark>, and spinach! geez...i know we couldn't even get to all of them!\n\ntheir famous banana cream pie was delicious! it was a little frozen...i prefer it to be a bit more thawed...but it was still good!\n\ntheir dinner rolls..ok...this is so filipino but damn..it tasted like hot pan-de-sal! it was so good! hahaha...seriously. emeril's gotta be stealing goldilock's or valerio's pandesal recipe! \n\n$400 for the 4 of us....it's alright...step outside and play roulette! make sure you put it all on red!", 
            "i've been here twice so far and i'd have to say the first experience was the best even though they burned my steak.  be aware that due to the way they cook their steaks you probably don't want anything over medium.  my gf hates raw meat so we ordered medium well and got a black looking steak.  i did complain and was told it was due to the way the prepare the steaks.  they did comp the steak which made things better.  i'm an appetizer man so i ordered several appetizers.  they were all excellent especially the fois gras dish.  \n\nwhat made my second experience less memorable?  menu changes!  even though i knew how to order my steak perfectly now, they changed the appetizer menu on me.  they no longer offer any fois gras!!!  i asked the reason for this and was told they had people protesting about the item so they discontinued it.  i was so looking forward to it that it ruined my whole night.  i sub'd the fois gras with the truffle oil home made <mark>Truffle and Parmesan Potato Chips</mark> and those are probably the best chips you'll ever have.  desserts must not have been good because i don't even remember what i had.", 
            "i seem to have really good luck with emeril's restaurants. after my recent visit to delmonico's, i'm beginning to think he can't go wrong. from the moment we walked in the door, it was just instantly different from all the other restaurants we visited. we were greeted warmly, seated immediately even though we were early, and had friendly, attentive service the entire time. \n\nthe atmosphere inside delmonico's is not at all what i would have expected, but it is simple and lovely. the colors are warm, the lighting is excellent (especially at a steakhouse, i need to be able to see my food!), and the decor is plain and easy on the eyes (not a lot of decoration at all).\n\nwe started with some <mark>Truffle and Parmesan Potato Chips</mark> and a <mark>Vine-Ripened Heirloom Tomato Salad</mark> to share while we were getting settled. vince curled up with the wine list with a big, giant grin on his face. ah, so many choices to go with steak, but we can't really go wrong with chambolle musigny, so there you go, and we threw in a bottle of sancerre to start. \n\ni ended up getting emeril's famous <mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark>, vince got the filet, and phil and alexandra got bbq shrimp and mushroom medallions. we also got an assortment of sides, including spinach, asparagus, mushrooms, and garlic <mark>Country Smashed Potatoes</mark>. for someone who likes pure, unadulterated meat, my ribeye was about as perfect as you can get. cooked to my desired rare plus bloodiness, with a simple crust of emeril's essence, a beautiful quality cut without any tendons or gristle, just beautiful meatiness. vince's filet was similarly perfect, nice and thick and bloody, with a delicious cajun rub that enhanced the meat without overpowering it. i was impressed with alexandra's medallions - they were pretty large for medallions; they looked like big 4 oz filets in their own right. i'd had the shrimp before at emeril's seafood restaurant so that was nothing new but those were also good. the spinach actually tasted like spinach (rather than cream), and the asparagus was nice and al dente. \n\ni finished up with some pecan pie, a generous jamaica blue mountain espresso (i was impressed that the coffee list provided a wide variety of espressos from which to choose), and a cognac. too bad it was only lunch! this meal was certainly the highlight of our trip (in addition to being the best, it was also the least expensive). afterwards our server took us on a tour of the restaurant. next time we are definitely going to try to reserve the chef's table. i already can't wait!", 
            "if you want a 5-star food experience, then follow these simple instructions:\n\norder the bone-in <mark>Filet Mignon</mark>, sauteed <mark>Sauted Garlic Mushrooms</mark>, <mark>Truffle and Parmesan Potato Chips</mark>.... trust me, your mouth will thank me.\n\nand yes, the mushrooms <mark>Truffle and Parmesan Potato Chips</mark> will still taste damn good as a post-partying 3am snack.  just use the chips to scoop up the mushrooms and go to town on 'em.\n\nhappy eating & you're welcome!!\n\noh, and i think the link on yelp is wrong... try this one:\nhttp://www.emerils.com/restaurant/5/delmonico-steakhouse/", 
            "the best choice for steaks in las vegas.  the staff are expert servers.  i have gone here for both intimate dinners and group dining, and all experiences have been beyond our expectations.  start with the truffled <mark>Truffle and Parmesan Potato Chips</mark>, then the <mark>Vine-Ripened Heirloom Tomato Salad</mark>, the mushrooms, the filet (black and blue of course), one of the potato specials, and stay for dessert (they sell cigars in the bar) and a glass of scotch to finish off the meal.", 
            "i really like delmonico's.  i've dined here multiple times and have never been disappointed in either the service or the food.  we decided to have lunch here on our most recent vegas excursion.  my dad tried to get reservations for noon, but was told that they could seat us at 12:30pm instead.  no biggie.\n\nwhen we arrived, there were only about two other tables occupied.  not sure why we couldn't come in at noon, but whatever.  we ordered the <mark>Truffle and Parmesan Potato Chips</mark> with truffle oil and parmesan as our app.  i never thought of <mark>Truffle and Parmesan Potato Chips</mark> as a gourmet dish, but now i know better.  excellent!\n\nmy sister and i split the salmon which had a bbq-esque sauce and was served with onion strings.  the waiter actually asked how we would like to have our salmon prepared.  i've never had a waiter ask that before.  pretty cool.  we also shared a side of broccoli (gotta eat your veggies) and the twice <mark>Baked Idaho Potato</mark> with white cheddar and bacon (omg!).  so yummy!\n\nfor dessert we all split two of the infamous banana cream pies.  can you say holy banana goodness?  another omg moment!  in all honesty, that pie is one of the main reasons we went to delmonico's.  ;)\n\ni would highly recommend dining at delmonico's if you are in the neighborhood.  be prepared for a leisurely meal (service can be slow, but it is relaxing) and some delicious food.  bon appetit!", 
            "as a restaurant under emeril lagasse's name, i was expecting a consistent, quality meal.  instead, i left very disapointed with the restaurant.  the only highlight was the signature bbq shrimp appetizer.  the <mark>Butternut Squash Ravioli</mark> with duck confit were unexplainably dry.  the shredded duck on top should be slightly dry or crispy, but the inside of the raviolis shouldn't be.  i don't know if i could even say the butternut squash was pasty.  so dry it was bordering on gritty.   \n\nthe <mark>Truffle and Parmesan Potato Chips</mark> were cut ultra thin and so tasty, but were dripping with too much oil.  instead of tasting light and airy, they felt weighed down by goopy oil drops that clung to each chip.  \n\nthen there's the steak.  we ordered one bone in ribeye and a standard ribeye.  both cuts were juicy, marbled nicely and cooked to the right levels, except for one thing, the steak had no taste.  what creates the taste, seasoning and aging?  well, whatever it was, it was only surface deep.  the outer portion of the steak was seasoned, but the meat in the middle really had no taste.  even the butter scoop that topped the steak couldn't make a noticeable difference.    \n\ndon't get me wrong, the meat quality was good, but if i pay $50 for a steak, i expect flavor.  it felt like i was eating a $25 steak.   i almost wanted to ask them for bernaise sauce to get me through it.  even though the wait staff was extremely helpful and attentive, it couldn't save this disappointing meal.   \n\nin vegas the only other steakhouse i've been to is n9ne at the palms and i would recommend that over delmonico's in a heartbeat.   i don't think i'll be going back.", 
            "i'll make this one an easy read. \n\ni have been to this steakhouse 4 times since it has opened. the 1st time being within it's 1st month, the last several weeks ago.\n\nmy 1st 2 visits were awesome, great steaks and sides and good service, then something happened on my 3rd trip about 1 1/2 years ago, the food was just o.k. not horrible but nothing that great. well a few weeks ago we were back at the venetian.  i was there with my wife, 2 sons(16 and 5) and my sister in law, everyone wanted steak, so we decided why not let's try delmonico's.\n\nturns out this was a bad choice and one that will keep me from going back, with all the new crops of good steakhouses(many within the same hallway) that have popped up since this place has opened, delmonico's needs to get it's act together.\n\nwe ordered 3 rib eyes, 1 filet, and my 5 year old got a burger. for sides truffled <mark>Truffle and Parmesan Potato Chips</mark>, mashed potatoes and corn.\n\nwhen we were sat, we immediately were served water and our drink orders taken, that was the highlight of the meal. it took about 20 minutes to get our drinks and orders taken. when we asked if they had anything specific for our 5 year old, they suggested the burger, fine he can have that, if not my wife would have just split some of her filet with him\n\nwhen our food came about 50 minutes later, mind you the place had just opened and there were no more than 4 other tables occupied. they put all our food down in front of us and they then proceeded to give my son a burger that had to have been at least 12 ounces, we all looked at each other and then commented on how and why would they serve him that.  mind you, waiter suggested this burger for the 5 yr old.\n\nback to the other plates, it was just large chunks of flavorless meat, the sides were bland and the truffled chips were soaking in oil. when it was all over and done we had been there almost 2 hours and were out almost $300. i have no problem spending good money for a good meal, but this meal left us feeling like we had wasted our time and our money.\n\nwill not go back.",

            "this was a dinner for work.. not sure if i'd pay for it on my own dime, but it was excellent! service was excellent. the sommelier even happily took back a $120 bottle of wine (guess that's cheap by vegas standards!) when the 2nd bottle smelled corked. \n\nappetizers:\n*<mark>Butternut Squash Ravioli</mark> - recommended if you love duck! covered in duck confit.. yummy!\n*bbq shrimp - sauce was rich, heavy and delish. it was almost a combination of a gumbo base and bbq sauce\n*<mark>Pan Seared <mark>Foie Gras</mark></mark> with berry tart (on the daily specials menu) - wow! if you follow my reviews, you know i'm a <mark>Pan Seared <mark>Foie Gras</mark></mark> lover, but this one was really excellent. the crossed grill marks on it were beautiful\n\nmain course:\n*bone in ribeye - 18 oz of buttery tasty goodness. well seasoned. not best steak i've had in my life material, but quite good.\n*<mark>Ahi Tuna</mark> - huge portion! cooked to perfection, but the enormous slabs were kind of off putting. i guess when you're paying $42 for freaking tuna you should get something substantial. plus it makes you feel more like your steak eating companions to have this retarded big portion on your plate.\n\nsides:\n*just get the <mark>Truffle and Parmesan Potato Chips</mark>.. you will thank me later!\n*grits covered in bacon couldn't get more fatty :) no complaints here\n\ndessert:\n*chocolate bread pudding - very chocolatey!\n*butterscotch pudding - good but honestly the freebie portion at bradley ogden is yummier!!",

            "located on restaurant row in the venetian is delmonico's steakhouse. this place is nice, very nice. the lounge area was spacious, plentiful amount of seating, with a bar area. not a bad place to hang out if there is a wait for your table. you are not able to see inside the restaurant from the lounge area. \n\nwe had a table of 13 and we were separated into 2 tables. the seats were very very comfortable. i believe they do accommodate large parties all in one table, but i guess for that time slot on that day, this was our only choice. reservations are highly recommended here and book in advance if you have a large party. \n\nour waiter or host shall i call him was very informative about just about everything! he recommended what was the best things on the menu, where to party after dinner, what wines were great, along with how i should get my steak cooked! he was simply awesome. \n\ni order the bone in rib steak which is also originally what the server recommended. the price for a good steak does not come cheap, this one was worth all $52.00. medium rare was perfect. the steak is huge it almost took up the whole entire plate, tender, moist, juicy, perfect temperature, minimal fat, butter came on top of the steak like a pancake, very easy to cut, bone was just this big straight across:\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nso it was very easy to get every last piece off the bone. \n\ni strongly suggest you order the steak with a nice red wine. your taste buds will be in heaven. \n\nthe sides are a bit deceiving if you look at the pictures of the sides. for some reason i was expecting a huge pot, but dont let the pictures fool you! the side order of sauteed mushrooms was very delicious. i put that to the side because i did not want to share with anyone. the <mark>Truffle and Parmesan Potato Chips</mark> was very greasy, save your $10 and order another side instead. \n\nthe calamari was okay. not worth the $14. marinara sauce came on top of the calamari already, so if you did not eat it fast enough, it could get soggy real quickly. \n\nthey have the best warm bread here ever! test yourself and see if you can resist just one! \n\ni can finally say i ate at one of emeril's restaurants! seeing you on the food network making all those different mouth watering dishes is for real! definitely a must try if you are a steak lover.", 
            "the steakhouse is like most traditional steakhouses. the decor was very clean and contemporary. the hostesses weren't all that attractive and would rate about a 5-6 in my scale of looks and their demeanor looked as if they did not really care to be there at all. \n\nthe dining area is half filled with patrons and business people alike chatting away about their day and how excellent the steak was prepared the beautiful burgundy high leather chairs is a nice touch and their seating area is plush and soft. the booth seating is a high suede sofa like seating and the tables were all lined with clean white linens and set in standard of most fine dining establishments. \n\ni took my seat and i was greeted by the waiter and the captain and was asked about my choice of entree. i decided to go with their <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> and go with my good instincts that this would be the best choice. the chef prepared all the appetizers for a sampling. classic jumbo <mark>Creole Boiled Gulf Shrimp Cocktail</mark>, <mark>Truffle and Parmesan Potato Chips</mark>, classic <mark>Caesar Salad</mark>, fried calamari, and mixed green salad. \n\nthe classic jumbo <mark>Creole Boiled Gulf Shrimp Cocktail</mark> with a extremely spicy cocktail sauce wasn't as good as i expected. the shrimp were cooked well and the shrimp were presented beautifully, however, the spicy cocktail sauce did not please my taste buds or my nostrils for that matter. the sauce was like eating a handful of wasabi.\n\n the extremely addicting <mark>Truffle and Parmesan Potato Chips</mark> were excellent and should be ordered every time any patron enters this restaurant. the chips were drizzled with truffle oils and shaved parmesan cheese and each individual chip melted as you put them in your mouth. \n\nthe classic <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> had much to desire. the way the salad was prepared was not my idea of a good salad. it was literally a huge chunk of romaine lettuce with the heart in tact served with a plain and unappealing caesar dressing. i don't like how fancy restaurants can slap a big chunk of romaine lettuce on a plate and call it a classic <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> just to be different. don't mess with a good thing!\n\nthe fried calamari was ok at best, not my favorite but definitely worth a taste. the mixed green salad was a way a salad should be prepared and had just the right amount of dressing. the waiter was attentive and knew what drinks were ordered. the plates were cleared but seemed like sometimes dead plates were left around. not a good sign of service. \n\nthe entree finally came and the presentation could have been better but the filet was ammmmazing. the steak knife cut through the filet like a butter knife through room temperature butter. the steak was cooked to medium rare perfectly and encrusted with some new orleans style spices. i truly enjoyed the filet till the very last bite. one thing i do have to mention is the dessert. i would highly recommend the famous emeril's banana cake. this thing was pure heaven and was absolutely delicious. i could not even describe it in words if i even tried so i won't! so you will have to try it for yourself. \n\noverall the experience was good, food was good but not the best i have tried, and the service was ok by my standards, but my standards can be high. my favorite parts were the filet and the dessert, the appetizers once again could have been better with the exception of the <mark>Truffle and Parmesan Potato Chips</mark>, mmm! delicious! i would recommend this place for dinner or lunch, however, the price can be a little daunting. i was calculating the totals of a appetizer, entree, and dessert and was estimating about 70-100 dollars a person with tip. that can look a little scary for some people, but for the meal and experience i'd say that was definitely worth it! many thanks for reading. till next time.", 
            "being that i am in real estate, i can't tell you how excited i was to be treated to a chi-chi expensive dinner that probably ended up costing the equivalent to what i budget for two weeks of groceries...per person, mind you!\n\ni was in town for a work conference and one of our clients was gracious enough to invite all of his brokers to dinner. \n\ni'm not much of a carnivore but..when in rome! it would be plain dumb of me to choose fish in a place known for their steak. that would be like ordering a hamburger at a chinese restaurant.\n\nhere's the nitty gritty:\n\nstarter: \n<mark>Caesar Salad</mark> (made table side for 2): shared w/ my co-worker. best damn <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> i've ever had! they even mix the dressing fresh.\n\nmain entree:\n<mark>Filet Mignon</mark> - medium rare: i think i died and went to beef heaven. so tender. so perfectly seasoned. so perfectly cooked! i'd be tempted to convert to carnivor-ism if i could eat like this more often.\n\nsides (a la carte):\nwe ordered a bunch for the table to share family style\n<mark>Delmonico Creamed Spinach</mark> - yum-o in my tum-o\nsauteed <mark>Sauted Garlic Mushrooms</mark> - shroomerific\n<mark>Truffle and Parmesan Potato Chips</mark> - the classiest chips on the block & a hit at the table. we fought over the chip with the most truffles.\n\ndessert (again, shared family style):\nbutterscotch pudding - not to sweet - just right but a taste was enough for me.\nchocolate brioche bread pudding - i liked all the layers and it wasn't overly rich \n\nthe service was absolutely impeccable. water glasses were never allowed to go half empty - they were promptly refilled by super observant waiters with bottled water in hand. whenever someone left their chair to use the restroom, they came back to their napkin, neatly refolded and they'll pull your chair out for you to sit.\n\ni've never seen a more professional or attentive group - and that in itself justifies their high prices.\n\ncome here and dine like royalty!", 
            "one of the best meals of my life.  my friends and i were celebrating in vegas, and looking for a place to do it up.  a $50 bottle of french wine later and the meal we had was filling, hedonistic, awesome, whatever superlative i could give.\n\nthe appetizers were great; i had gumbo, and split barbeque shrimp and <mark>Butternut Squash Ravioli</mark> with duck confit on top.  portions for apps were not  teeny, which was impressive, because honestly i expected it to be.\n\nthen comes the main course.  all four of us split the chateaubriand, which was tender, carved tableside, and delicious.  the crust of the steak was delicious as well.  almost as impressive were the side dishes; <mark>Truffle and Parmesan Potato Chips</mark> and creamed corn (yes, who thought creamed corn could emerge from the cafeteria lunch as a delicious side dish).\n\nyes, it's expensive; it's vegas.  but i was very impressed with the quality.  will gladly go back when i have more $.",

            "really good steakhouse! we went there for our friend's birthday. the environment is nice but maybe a tiny bit noisier as i expected. my boyfriend and i ordered a <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> to share, which was good but not especially exciting. he ordered a <mark>Filet Mignon</mark>, i believe, and was fantastic! it literally melted in my mouth and we were able to cut it with a butter knife.. so tender! i ordered a season entree - grilled halibut on a bed of lumbcrab meat w/ some kind of aioli. it was alright... the crab was tasty but the fish was a bit dry... \n\nour friend ordered the tournedos au poivre and his girlfriend ordered the ribeye. the ribeye was huge for the price! we also ordered a couple of sides to share - new orleans <mark>Delmonico Creamed Spinach</mark>, sauteed <mark>Sauted Garlic Mushrooms</mark> <mark>Truffle and Parmesan Potato Chips</mark>. i have to say the mushrooms was really good! didn't really care for the <mark>Delmonico Creamed Spinach</mark> because it was too heavy for me. the chips was good, too, but i wanted to compare it to alexander's truffle oil fries... that's one of my future plans =p\n\noverall, i think the steaks are worth the price. other stuff are good but not extremely exciting.... i guess you should always go for the steaks at a steakhouse!",

            "i gave myself a few days before i wrote this review, to see if all the money i dropped on this dinner would be worth it. i've never spent so much on a dinner before, and so even with the glowing yelp reviews, i went into this a little uneasy.\n\nmy boyfriend had paid for most of our vegas trip, so i wanted to treat him to something special. this most definitely was.\n\nwe made reservations that morning (thursday, so probably a slow night) for 7 pm. we arrived and were quickly seated. the decor was understated, with muted beige walls and plush brown leather chairs.\n\nthe service was impeccable. we had three waiters taking care of us! water glasses never got more than half empty, and they were always ready to please. i asked where the women's room was, and the waiter led me there instead of just giving me directions. i really appreciated that, since the bathrooms were hidden away.\n\nlovely bathrooms though, but i expected that. a nice touch for the ladies was a basket of feminine supplies provided in case of emergency,\n\nbut now, to the main attraction: the food. oh dear god, the food. we started with the <mark>Truffle and Parmesan Potato Chips</mark>. so simple, but sooooo good.\n\ni got a rare <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> and the boyfriend got the bone-in rib eye medium rare. we got just one side, the cheddar bacon grits. they were good, but could have used more bacon. then again, i think everything could use more bacon.\n\nthe meat was... quite literally the best i ever had. i love my steaks bloody, but my plate was clean until i cut into the steak. chalk that up to a good sear and the excellent crust from the rub they use. it was kinda cajun-y, but didn't overpower the glorious meat. it was allowed to prove itself as is and it was worth every penny.\n\nwe surprisingly still had room, so we went for dessert. i went for my old standby, the creme brulee. the boyfriend was intrigued by the root beer float with sarsaparilla sorbet. \n\ncan't screw up creme brulee, so no complaints. the sugar crust was thicker than expected, but the sweetness was offset by the chocolate shortbread cookies that came with it. chocolatey, but not sweet. i could snack on them all day.\n\nbut the root beer float was a work of art. came to the table in one of those tall sundae glasses, with the sarsaparilla sorbet on the bottom and vanilla ice cream on top. waiter poured the bottle of root beer and left the rest for him.\n\nmy boyfriend is a root beer connoisseur. he used to make his own, so he knows his root beer. and he is still going crazy over that float. i think that speaks for itself.\n\nso while at first i might have been apprehensive, i'm really glad we came here. it's out of our budget to do again anytime soon, but i definitely won't forget it.", 
            "this was my first trip to vegas...ever.  i know, how can that be after 31 years of age and my love for everything naughty?  nevertheless, i wanted to have one memorable, fantastic dinner while there.  after consulting with a few friends and reading fellow yelpers reviews we decided on delmonico steakhouse at the venetian.\n\nfirst, i was able to make our reservation online about two months in advance (same time i booked the trip).  it was so easy i would definitely recommend it to ensure you will have a table ready and waiting for you.  second, because mr. vivi and i were killing it at the blackjack table at the mandalay...we were about 15 minutes late for our reservation.  i apologized numerous times when we arrived, and to my relief our table was still ours and the host was super friendly and understanding.  note:  i don't know if this would fly on a busy fri or sat night.\n\nto say the service was excellent could be an understatement.  we had our main server, i think his name was eric (insert free drinks at the aforementioned blackjack table so his name could have been bob) and he couldn't be more helpful, polite and efficient.  we also had two other people who were assisting eric with the service who were great as well.  eric helped me pick out a glass of red wine that was delicious and didn't make me feel bad for not being the wine connoisseur everyone and their mom thinks they are.  our drinks were brought to us very quickly and we were off to the food.  \n\ni had been perusing the menu for awhile and thought we would go with a full four course meal however, i had no idea how fun the tables would be and didn't want too much food to deter my winnings after dinner.  we opted to skip the appetizer (would have loved to have try the crab cakes or at least the <mark>Truffle and Parmesan Potato Chips</mark>) and went straight to the cesar salad served table side for two.  if you love cesar salad please do me a favor and run to this place.  they freaking make the entire thing in front of you, dressing included.  when eric was finished with my plate i could have clapped i was so happy...in fact i think i did. \n\nnext, we went for the petite medallions with a side of asparagus and a twice <mark>Baked Idaho Potato</mark>.  can i say i am in heaven??  this is why i could never be a vegetarian.  the meat was cooked to absolute perfection.  so tender it felt like butter in my mouth.  the asparagus and twice <mark>Baked Idaho Potato</mark> were both good, but i would definitely try something different next time...there is just too much to chose from.  \n\ni knew in advance the bill was going to be somewhat expensive but seriously, it was worth every single penny.  from start to finish the entire experience made me forget i left a table we were up 500 dollars.  \"ah yeah babe,\" this place is that good and i will be back the next time i visit.",

            "i think this is the first time i went to a higher end restaurant in las vegas and walked out thinking...it's worth the price.  \n\nour server was pretty awesome in my mind. took great care of us and explain the specials thoroughly.  also helped gave us the idea that the last person at the table should take care of the tab. =)\n\ntheir whole menu sounds tasty....good selection of meats and a lot of sides/appetizers to accommodate your needs.\n\ni ordered the truffle oil & <mark>Truffle and Parmesan Potato Chips</mark> for my appetizer.\nomg....it tasted so good.  best chips i've ever had!!!  it's crunchy...tasty...and best of all...it's cheesy!\n\nfor my entree....i stucked with their bone-in rib eye with a side of corn. i always like my steak medium rare and they cooked it to perfection.  steak was super tender and juicy.  dash some horse-radish on the side and i'm happy.\n\nmy buddy eugene ordered their \"tomahawk\" which is basically a 32 oz. ribeye with a big ass rib to boot.  he topped it off....of course....with some <mark>Pan Seared <mark>Foie Gras</mark></mark>.  \n\nmost of the table ordered their own rib eye steak....and ordered a lot of different sides to mix it up.  i'll say my favorite was the wild mushrooms and the grits.\n\noverall, pretty good...will definitely come back to give this place a second spin.", 
            "first impressions......unfortunately, delmonico steakhouse made a huge mistake when they seated my party of three at the table right in front of the kitchen door with a restaurant that was less than half full.  offensive and unacceptable.  the hostess ran in one direction and a staff member told us we would have to make our way back up to the front to deal with this issue when we told them that this would not work for us.  after a word with someone who claimed to be the manager at the front, we were reseated and promptly given complimentary <mark>Truffle and Parmesan Potato Chips</mark> (that can solve any bad first impression).  the <mark>Truffle and Parmesan Potato Chips</mark> are not to be missed.  \n\nservice-  our server eventually warmed up and was pleasant.   he was so caught up in his speeches about different parts of the menu and recommendations, that it took some time to see his true personality.  he was also rushed, which was odd, as we had some menu questions.  \n\nfood-  the filet was magical.  this is the primary reason that the restaurant got 4 stars.  the creole seasoning and dab of butter on the steak were an amazing and sinful treat.  really delicious.\n\nthe cheese grits were delicious.  i was a bit less impressed with the <mark>Delmonico Creamed Spinach</mark>.  the waiter said that it was better than cut's version.  no way!  underwhelming.", 
            "always a 5 star time at delmonico's the ambiance, service & food always makes we leave with a smile. there have been times, where i try other steak houses when in vegas, but i always leave saying. \"not as good as delmonico's\"... my order is usually the same each time; start with the <mark>Truffle and Parmesan Potato Chips</mark>, then <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> (mmmmmmmm),  sides cream of spinach and cream of corn... then the bone in rib eye - medium....    \n\ni'm smiling just thinking about it....", 
            "i came here back in 2005 with my family and had a phenomenally memorable meal. six years later -- i came back this past weekend and it was stellar. extensive wine list, excellent service, ridiculously buttery brioche bread, great cocktails, and of course, the food!\n\nfor apps, my party had the <mark>Truffle and Parmesan Potato Chips</mark> (so rich but delish!), <mark>Butternut Squash Ravioli</mark> with duck confit (superb), <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> (mmm with large lobster chunks), and the wedge salad (as perfect as a classic wedge gets). \n\nfor entrees, i had the <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> that was perfectly cooked to a true medium-rare. i often find that, when i order med-rare, more often than not, highly rated restaurants overcook my meat to more of a med to med-well, which is can be disappointing. well, here at delmonico, it was perfect! friends got the <mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark> and the huge $85 fred flinstone steak (i forget the official name), all cooked to perfection. the 2007 joseph phelps cab paired divinely with the steaks. \n\nsides:  creamed corn was mind-blowing; <mark>Delmonico Creamed Spinach</mark> was good but didn't knock my socks off (compared to everything else which did). \n\nwe were too stuffed to order a dessert, but we received a complimentary birthday gelato. nice gesture, but it was not so great -- i think it was a non-conventional flavor, like fennel or something?\n\noverall, i would definitely return the next time i'm in the mood for a (pricey) steak dinner in vegas!!! emeril is a genius!",

            "amazing steak, as well as some of the best service i've ever had at a restaurant.\n\nmy friends and i came here for dinner on a sunday (with a reservation, just in case), and we decided to split two steaks between 3 girls. we ehard that the portions are very generous, and we also wanted to try out the sides as well.\n\nwe ordered the bone in ribeye, along with the bone in <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> with a mushroom sauce (one of the specials of the day).  we also ordered the <mark>Truffle and Parmesan Potato Chips</mark>, as well as the <mark>Creamed Corn Gratine</mark> and the <mark>Country Smashed Potatoes</mark>.\n\nthe first thing to come out were the <mark>Truffle and Parmesan Potato Chips</mark>. sadly, for a girl who eats <mark>Truffle and Parmesan Potato Chips</mark> as her main meal frequently, i couldn't partake of them because of the parmesan (i cannot stand stinky cheese).  however, i did at least try one, and the texture of the chip (similar to a kettle chip almost), and the slight hint of truffle was amazing. however, the parmesan was still prominent, so i watched sadly while my gfs devoured the chips. i felt as if i was being punished, for some reason.\n\nluckily our steaks arrived at that point, and they were huge. it was definitely a good idea that we had decided to split two instead of each of us ordering our own.  our server (who's name i forgot), was incredibly helpful and nice. he brought over a carving table and after presenting the steaks to us, took them aside and carved them all for us.  we got our sides at that point too, and we just dug in.\n\nthe rib eye was incredibly flavorful. i tend to not normally order it because not all places will grill the ribeye properly and i end up with a slightly tough steak (even if ordered at medium). this one had just the right amount or pink, and the seasoning was mild enough so that the flavor of the meat shone through.  \n\nthe filet was also very tender.  while we were eating the filet without the mushroom demiglace, i decided to test it out.  the sauce is based on a reduction of veal stock, and it complimented the steak wonderfully. it didn't mask the taste of the meat at all but just added another dimension to it.  after urging my friends to try the sauce, we quickly started pouring spoonfuls of it over the rest of the steak on our plates.\n\nthe sides were very good as well. the creamed corn had a hint of spice due to some mined jalapenos that were in it. definitely a trick i am looking forward to trying at home.\n\nas great as the food was, i was also very impressed with the level of service. you would think that a fancy steak restaurant would be annoyed at the sharing of steaks, but they never batted an eye to our request (apparently a lot of people do this).  in addition, we never felt as if we were waiting to flag down a server whenever we needed assistance.\n\nfor everything we got, the meal itself also came out to be a lot less than i expected (although i'm sure it has to do with the sharing as well). however, we were so full and satisfied from our meal that we promptly fell asleep back in our room and decided against going out that night. that is definitely a sign of a great meal.", 
            "3.5\n\ni had high hopes for delmonico, as many had said some great things.  being an emeril restaurant i figured it was just another celebrity chef restaurant, so i had my reservations.  the place was well decorated and had a great vibe.  the food was up to par and certain items had great taste, such as the <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark>.  i was hoping for more with the wilted spinach salad, but it was still ok.  the complimentary amuse bouche was a nice touch, tasted like a truffle cream of mushroom.  now the steak, everyone says to go with the <mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark>, so that's what i got.  tasty, but needed a bit more flavor.  not as buttery and smooth as other high end steakhouses.  service could use some attention for a restaurant of this caliber.  forgot our <mark>Truffle and Parmesan Potato Chips</mark> and service went downhill with the way they took our plates and such.\n\nnot sure i'd go back with all the other many celebrity chef restaurants to try, but it's definitely one of the better ones.",

            "the service here is very mixed.  the first time i came (months ago), the host/hostess was nowhere to be found for like 10 minutes when i arrived for my party's reservation.  then once someone was at the front desk, she totally ignored my existence and we stood there for another ten minutes.  then some guy finally comes and i'm like i had reservations for so and so time and he is like i'm sorry, we just had a large party come in so there may be a bit of a wait.  \n\nok?  that was a first.  i was expecting a little more attentiveness from a restaurant like this.  and it was kind off-putting to have had reservations at a restaurant of this calibre not honored.  we were told to wait in the bar area, where we were not even offered so much as a glass of water, and then ignored for another 15 minutes by the hostess until we decided to leave.\n\nthe next day, someone calls me and is like you missed your reservation last night.  um no, we were there and waited for about 45 minutes and left.  then he was apologetic and offered to comp our dinner if we were to come back, but i was flying out that day and had to decline that offer.  then he proceeded to ask for my address so that they could send a gift card.  i was like ok sure.\n\ni was surprised that the gift card was for as much as it was.  it was very generous of them.\n\non to the visit where i actually got to eat!\n\nthe mister and i came during lunch time on a sunday.  again, the hostess was nowhere to be found for the first 5 minutes or so.  then she comes out and is like there is going to be a wait (i had reservations, yet again.)  so we sat at the bar, where the very attentive (and i guess new) bartender proceeded to hand us menus.  then we were like ehh we'll just eat at the bar.  a couple minutes later, the hostess was finally like oh ok are you guys eating here?\n\nwe started with the <mark>Truffle and Parmesan Potato Chips</mark> with truffle oil and parmesan mmmmm!!  for my entree, i had the gulf shrimp with fettucine and preserved lemon.  the shrimp was very juicy and fresh-tasting.  the bartender, who ended up being pretty much our server was very nice, attentive, and actually really fun to talk to.\n\nso despite the initial situation, four stars for the delicious food, service at the bar, and the lengths the management went to make up for the mistake.",

            "i've never had a meal experience like what i had at delmonico's. me and a buddy were in vegas for the first time and decided we wanted to go out for a good steak dinner. i asked for recommendations from people and settled on delmonico's. i made reservations the monday before the thursday we went to dinner. i checked out the menu ahead of time and was not surprised to see the pretty high prices., i was confident though that we were gonna get what we paid for. \nwe arrived about 45 minutes before the reservation time and had a couple beers in the lounge. $6 for a bud light was pretty reasonable for this atmosphere. we were seated promptly at 7 and that's where things got impressive. the dining area is secluded, you have no idea you are in a casino, which is great. we were greeted by one of our 3 waiters and offered the wine menu. neither of us drink wine, but i could tell the selection was awesome. \nwe ordered the <mark>Truffle and Parmesan Potato Chips</mark> and bowls of the gumbo. both were excellent, emeril knows gumbo. i ordered the <mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark> and my buddy got the filet. we also got the <mark>Potato Gratin</mark> and a twice <mark>Baked Idaho Potato</mark>. the sides are ala carte and family style. they were some of the best potatoes we had ever had. as for the steaks, they were both the greatest steaks we had ever had! no sauce is necessary for these babies. after dinner i had the banana cream pie, which was exceptional. my buddy had the cheesecake and said it was awesome. \noverall i can not speak highly enough of the dining experie nce at delmonico's. the professional staff, excellent atmosphere, and amazing food make delmonico's a place i will go to again.",

            "i had a late-ish dinner around 9 here on friday the 28th of july after seeing phantom at the venetian because the restaurant was close to the theater. i noticed there was a piano in the waiting room but no one was playing it; instead they were blasting the sportscast on the tv which soured the mood. once seated the atmosphere was largely pleasant but also a bit too loud and some of the staff seemed uncertain and nervous. our head server in particular was not enjoying himself at all and was visibly annoyed by the group across from our table which was loitering around the restaurant for a long time after finishing their meal. \n\nthe meal itself was very good, especially my bone-in-ribeye which is their signature cut. it's a slightly glazed and massive piece of meat, rubbed with a cajun sauce that gave it zest and even a bit of spice. it paired beautifully with the bourbon-bacon manhattan i ordered at the bar. my dining companion had the <mark>Bone-In New York Strip</mark> which was fine but not nearly as memorable as the bone-in. like the cuts of the meat, the sides are probably too big and one side is more than enough for 2 people. however both of the sides we had (the wild mushrooms and the spinach) were delicious so it would be difficult to pick one. the appetizers were relatively standard, with the exception of the parmesan-<mark>Truffle and Parmesan Potato Chips</mark> but be forewarned that delicious as they are they are very filling and quite greasy.", 
            "solid.  still serving up all the flavor, fat, and syrupy opulence one expects from the emeril lagasse empire.  oh, it happens to serve some great steaks.\n\nlunch is straight forward.  salads, gumbo, and an incredible steak sandwich.  a juicy skirt steak is topped with loads of roasted mushrooms, onions, wilted spinach and a pungent horseradish mayo on a warm ciabatta roll with a side of crispy truffle fries.  a great deal for under $20.\n\ndinner brings out the best.  for starters its hard to pass on the truffle parm <mark>Truffle and Parmesan Potato Chips</mark> (you weren't expecting that huh).  crispy, earthy, just good eats and so perfect with any cocktail or wine.  the roasted <mark>Heirloom Tomato Soup</mark> with  grilled ricotta cheese sandwich, creamy and acidic, comforting goodness.\n\nthe steaks are all great quality usda prime.  well trimmed and dry aged on site.  unfortunately, the selection of cuts is limited.   the bone in strip, dense beefy goodness and stands up well to the creole seasoning (used on all their steaks).  dry aged steak purist will balk at its use as it destroys the umame goodness.  the bone in rib is more tender and makes the perfect base for \"oscar\" style prep (topped with a generous heaping of jumbo lump crab meat, asparagus, and a very rich and tangy b\\u00e9arnaise that blends perfectly with the creole seasoning). win!\n\nit's not all about the steaks.  the apple smoked kurobuta ham chop with grits and cider reduction is outstanding.  pure simplicity.  natural, tender ham packing  deep \"hammy\" flavor whose richness and saltiness is balanced perfectly by the acidity and sweetness of hard cider reduction.  holiday ham on steroids!\n\nfriendly and efficient service.\n\nvery good wine list.  vegas resort prices.\n\nbam! bam! bam! bam! (four stars; yeah i couldn't resist).", 
            "i was treated to a lovely birthday dinner here and was pleasantly surprised.  the restaurant is a lot bigger than it actually looks.  walking past it in the venetian, you wouldn't believe it extends back to a full restaurant.\n\nthe ambiance is elegant, comfortable, but friendly.  the manager came out before our meal to greet us and wish me a happy birthday, which was rather special.  the wine list was over 100 pages long and took us quite some time to decide which bottle to get.\n\nwe had the truffle & <mark>Truffle and Parmesan Potato Chips</mark>, which were just okay, and a small charcuterie plate with homemade cheese chips.\nfor our main courses, i ordered the <mark>Filet Mignon</mark>.  my date ordered the bone in ribeye with <mark>Pan Seared <mark>Foie Gras</mark></mark>.  my steak was arguable the best steak i've ever had.  it was perfectly buttery, seared and charred on the outside but tender, moist, juicy, and pink on the inside.  i had a bite of the ribeye with <mark>Pan Seared <mark>Foie Gras</mark></mark>, which was just savory overload.\nfor dinner, we received a complimentary \"happy birthday\" sorbet with a candle in it.\n\ni had a great experience there and would go back again for the steak.  i only gave 4 stars and not 5 because the other menu items (starters and sides) were very forgettable.  the steak however, was unforgettable. \n\ndate night seal of approval!", 
            "i'd probably give delmonico four stars, except that my expectations were set higher than they probably should have been. in all honesty, the delmonico did not deliver anything notably better, more worthy of celebrity, than the average high end steak house in nashville - including stoney river, ruth's, or local favorites like sperry's. i guess i thought that for all the critique emeril gives top chef stars, his restaurant would blow me away.\n\nthe homemade <mark>Truffle and Parmesan Potato Chips</mark> were good, and somewhat unique, but perhaps a little over cooked, leaving a numb of chips hard.\n\nour steaks were indeed prepared excellently, and a quality cut of meat. i had the filet, which was an ample serving and cooked to a perfect medium rare.\n\nbut the twice <mark>Baked Idaho Potato</mark> were a big disappointment. <mark>Half Dozen Raw Oysters on the Half Shell</mark> seems to be way overcooked, to the point or requiring a steak knife to cut through them. the flavor was bland, even with cheddar and bacon. a little salt and pepper certainly helped.\n\nwe did enjoy the <mark>Delmonico Creamed Spinach</mark>, even including my colleague who usually doesn't like green things.\n\nthe bread pudding was definitely the way to go on dessert. we also had a slice of banana cream pie, but the star was the bread pudding, which was not ruined with raisins. it was rich, smooth, creamy and delicious.",

            "as vegas steakhouses go, delmonico is a fine choice. i've been there twice and both times i've had very good meals. with that said, meeting expectations at this high price point is challenging, and particularly on my most recent visit i'm afraid delmonico should have been even better. this year we had a large company dinner at delmonico, so i was able to try lots of dishes. \n\nwe started with the bbq shrimp and the <mark>Butternut Squash Ravioli</mark>. the shrimp was good but a little overcooked. the squash was on the rich side but really tasty - you couldn't have but so many so it is good that they list it as an appetizer rather than as a pasta main. i loved one or two but a plateful would've been too much.  i also tried the <mark>Truffle and Parmesan Potato Chips</mark>, which were wonderful but extremely truffley. \n\nthe <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> was textbook, exactly what <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> is supposed to be - rich and creamy with chunks of tender lobster meat. still i might have preferred my neighbor's <mark>Vine-Ripened Heirloom Tomato Salad</mark>, which i tried and thought was one of the highlights of the meal.  i didn't try it but the duck from the smoked duck salad was not well received by another of my colleagues. \n\nfor my entr\\u00e9e i had the delmonico signature steak - a <mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark>. this is where the meal fell down ever so slightly. the steak was fine but for the premium price it should have been exceptional and it definitely wasn't. my order of medium rare was barely pink at all and was probably served on the dark side of medium, and i thought the meat was surprisingly devoid of flavor. don't get me wrong - it was a fine steak, but it was average among the steaks i've had in las vegas, at all price points. one of my close work friends who has frequented delmonico for years ordered the same cut at the dinner and he agreed that for his steak too it was an off-night. of the sides i loved the creamed corn. next time i'd do the mashed potatoes over the scalloped potatoes, which i found undercooked and under seasoned. the asparagus was also fine but unspectacular. \n\nthe bread pudding was great and the key lime pie (or was it cheesecake?) was nice too, but i'll reserve my sweetest accolades for the banana cream pie. best bite of the night. one of the best i've had. wonderful.", 
            "delmonico is a terrific steakhouse, with great food and ambiance. we are from ny and have been to a lot of top notch steakhouses, so were really impressed by this restaurant.  tom baker made it even more memorable, great maitre d/waiter! i highly recommended <mark>Emeril's BBQ Salmon</mark> and the bone-in fillet.  the real surprise were the <mark>Truffle and Parmesan Potato Chips</mark> - delicious!",

            "this place is a little gem.  yes it is very pricey but the service combined with great food make it a great place to dine.  we had the ny steak and rib eye along with the <mark>Truffle and Parmesan Potato Chips</mark>, <mark>Buttered Fresh Broccoli</mark> and the chocolate cake. first the service is impeccable five star all the way.  the hosts have only a few tables and are very accessible while not being overbearing.  they have assistants that are every bit the professional as the hosts.  was treated very well.\n\nthe food is amazing.  the steaks are quite large and bone-in meaning great flavor.  i think better than ruth's chris even.  the sides were good the <mark>Truffle and Parmesan Potato Chips</mark> are highly recommended!  and the pop-overs that they start with are good if not a bit heavy.  \n\nthe chocolate cake was also great.  the place is pricey for sure but you get what you pay for here.  highly recommend this place for a great experience!", 
            "the steak was cooked perfectly and was worth the price. in addition, we ordered the <mark>Truffle and Parmesan Potato Chips</mark> and devoured them in minutes. i also got a lychee drink which was pretty good but probably too expensive for me to ever order again. but if we're ever back in vegas, we'll be sure to drop by this restaurant again for the steak!", 
            "i'm still dreaming about this meal. we don't often spend this kind of money on a dinner out, but this was a special night out in vegas, so why not? let me tell you, it was worth every penny. \n\ntop items include:\ndelmonico cocktail. it was heaven, but i love gin and grapefruit and it was a perfect mix. \n\nthe <mark>Truffle and Parmesan Potato Chips</mark>. oh my goodness they were so good. \n\nthe steak my husband ordered melted in your mouth. it was perfectly cooked to order and had fantastic taste. \n\ni ordered seared scallops, a special. totally amazing. \n\nwe went with our servers recommendation on dessert, the flourless chocolate torte. i'm still pining over it. \n\nabove all, the service was phenomenal. we had a table of 8 and we always had an attentive server ready to answer any questions, provide recommendations that were always spot on, or even help us find a lost card. \n\ngreat spot!", 
            "after three years of waiting, i finally found myself back to delmonico steakhouse. why did i come here out of all the other excellent steak houses on the las vegas strip?\n\n1 reason: <mark>Truffle and Parmesan Potato Chips</mark>. they are like crack, you simply can't stop eating them :)\n\ni ordered the <mark>Certified Piedmontese</mark> steak, ny strip steak ($60), grilled in olive oil, sea salt, roasted garlic and rosemary. at 16 ounces, each tender bite was worth every dollar.\n\ngirlfriend ordered the grilled cheese sandwich with <mark>Heirloom Tomato Soup</mark> and said it was very good.\n\nservice is impeccable with a three person staff dedicated to your table and they make your experience worth the high price tag that is at delmoncio!", 
            "the food was okay/good and service was great.  the service made our okay meal a better experience. when my bf and i were first seated, we were asked if we were celebrating anything. we told them our anniversary and was served a complimentary amuse-bouche and sorbet dessert at the end.\n\nyay:\n-<mark>Truffle and Parmesan Potato Chips</mark>: freshly made and amazing in flavor. you can taste all the elements of this working well together. i thought the truffle oil was going to overwhelm the dish but it was nicely perfumed throughout and complimented the freshly grated parmesan. the chips were thin, crispy and airy. i almost ate the whole thing before my meal but had to stop myself. \n\nother:\n-ribeye steak special: the special of the day was a petite rib eye with <mark>Pan Seared <mark>Foie Gras</mark></mark>. the steak otherwise would have been bland had it not been for the <mark>Pan Seared <mark>Foie Gras</mark></mark>. it was perfectly cooked to my medium rare preference. \n-ribeye: my bf got the regular ribeye without the special and it come out to be almost the same size as my petite filet. it was slightly seasoned more than mine. however when we reheated the leftover steaks, mine held up better and the <mark>Pan Seared <mark>Foie Gras</mark></mark> melted into the meat flavoring it better than this one. \n-mashed potatoes: just regular, nothing fancy.", 
            "this absolutely by far is my favorite steakhouse in las vegas. i went here again on my 29th birthday, and the service was amazing as always. i ordered the ribeye to share along with the best <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> you will ever have. also the <mark>Truffle and Parmesan Potato Chips</mark> are to die for. the restaurant is very classy and a bit pricey, however, you get what you pay for. i've tried pretty much all of the restaurants at the venetian, and i have to stay this one is my absolute favorite. the steaks come out a perfect medium rare cooked to perfection in butter.\n\nsince this is a popular restaurant, i highly recommend making a reservation in advance. it's a nice restaurant to take a date as well as to celebrate a special occasion.", 
            "i had dinner there last night with a friend and my wife. the service was flawless, courteous and diligent. the appetizers were great, the octopus and the <mark>Truffle and Parmesan Potato Chips</mark>, highly recommended. the <mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark> was cooked perfectly. \ni will have to go back to try other things in the menu. my friend had spent most of the afternoon thinking about a good ribeye.  delmonico served him what he wanted and he was blown away...", 
            "first off, to make the most of your experience, you should know what to expect from delmonico service by doing your yelp homework. this place doesn't get a full 5 stars because of the service. \n\nit's been a while since i've felt so insulted by a server. i don't even know his name since he didn't introduce himself, so i know him as the big guy with a beard. he was unfriendly and wrote us off immediately when the table next to us wanted to share half of their <mark>Seafood Tower</mark> with us (it's massive and delicious by the way... thank you amazing strangers from new mexico!).\n\nwe were celebrating an anniversary and greeted warmly by the host stand, but while other yelpers say that their servers brought them a scoop of sorbet to celebrate, we got nothing. so hold your server accountable to giving you the experience you deserve for the price tag you pay. he would have gotten 30% if he wasn't such a douche.\n\nonto the food!\n- <mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark>: duh, do as all 1100 yelp reviews say and get this! fantastic marbling with an amazing crust. and yes... share a steak and order some other stuff! \n\n- <mark>Roasted Fingerling Potatoes</mark>- a light hint of rosemary and more potatoes than a patch on a farm. really tasty and beautiful. sides all seem easily shareable for four people.\n\n- <mark>Delmonico Creamed Spinach</mark>- not too heavy on seasoning, but perfectly delicious and enjoyable. perfect with the ribeye.\n\n- <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark>- if you get this, i would highly recommend sharing. it's too rich and heavy to eat a whole bowl.\n\n- penis-shaped pop-overs (as another yelp reviewer notes)- try a bite, but save room for appetizers!\n\nat the end of the day, i would certainly come back for the food. you will end up ordering too much because everything sounds delicious; next time we'll be trying bbq shrimp and truffled <mark>Truffle and Parmesan Potato Chips</mark> too!", 
            "<mark>Truffle and Parmesan Potato Chips</mark> were so delicious.  caesar isn't really worth it.  steak was ok, needed more flavor in my opinion.  so happy to see <mark>Pan Seared <mark>Foie Gras</mark></mark> on their menu but it was just ok - i've had better.  the scalloped potatoes were under cooked so we had to send it back - boo boo.  everything else was ok.  great service.", 
            "the food is outstanding. the service is amazing. the <mark>Truffle and Parmesan Potato Chips</mark> are to die for. their <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> is incomparable. steak and shrimp is great as well.", 
            "what a wonderful food experience!!  our waiter ryan was perfect and treated us well. give the <mark>Truffle and Parmesan Potato Chips</mark> a try, you will love them. <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> was good as was our steaks.  side dishes are large so split the order.  the decor is lovely and it was a nice quiet atmosphere. wish we had room for dessert but maybe next time.  there's definitely lots of places to eat in vegas but i have to say come to delmonico steakhouse. it's well worth every penny.", 
            "i love fine dining and this place exceeds expectations. went for my birthday, boyfriend and i had the <mark>Truffle and Parmesan Potato Chips</mark>, amazing. could have ate like 5 orders of them they were so good. i ordered wagyu fillet. best steak i have. flavor amazing, melted in your mouth and was just insanely good. bf got the strip i think...? or ribeye haha don't remember but whatever it was it was great too. we had twice <mark>Baked Idaho Potato</mark>, great. and the duck egg cr\\u00e8me br\\u00fbl\\u00e9e, great except the sugar was a little too hard and tasted a little burnt in spots but that's the only complaint. the service was beyond amazing too. so attentive and very nice. will be coming back here often", 
            "food amazing, mushrooms and <mark>Colorado Rack of Lamb</mark> were excellent. <mark>Truffle and Parmesan Potato Chips</mark> so addicting! i had made an advance reservation and made a comment that it was my boyfriends birthday and asked for a special table. when we arrived the hostess seated us at a table 2 feet from other guests on one side and up against a wall on the other side. when i asked her if they had a nicer table she said that the dining room was full. then she looked around and asked what table i wanted. i told her that i had requested a nice cozy table when i made my reservation. i was disappointed in the location of the table especially since i had made that specific request. she then moved us to a table that was right next to the entrance and sound volume buttons/lighting controls of the restaurant. it also was not what i expected but at least we weren't right next to another group. throughout dinner the managers were constantly walking by and playing with the volume buttons and lighting buttons on the wall. on a good note , our server and the food was exceptional however i have been to several fine dining restaurants and was disappointing that my small request was not granted. it's the little things that make a difference.", 
            "finally, after many visits to las vegas, i made it to delmonico steakhouse at the venetian, and i loved my dinner! ordered both the <mark>Pan Seared <mark>Foie Gras</mark></mark> and the <mark>Truffle and Parmesan Potato Chips</mark> to start. they were both brought to the table at the same time so i knew i would need to eat the <mark>Pan Seared <mark>Foie Gras</mark></mark> first which was quite good. the <mark>Truffle and Parmesan Potato Chips</mark> were great, and since i had ordered the wagyu ribeye for $90, i didn't want to fill up on the chips, i asked if they could box up the chips to take back to my room.  no problem, and they were delicious the next day! the wagyu ribeye is the best beef i've ever had! perfect med-rare with great flavor and the most tender beef ever! i've had wagyu at other steakhouses in lv, but this blew away the competition!  the size was perfect for me: 6 or 8 ounces (i forgot which). since this is white truffle season, i chose the white truffle ice cream that is vanilla ice cream stuffed with lots of small pieces of truffle. it is served as 3 balls which i figured i'd eat one or two, but it was so addictive that i ate the whole thing! service was very friendly and attentive. delmonico steakhouse is now my favorite steakhouse!"

            "so, after several years of not eating at an restaurant of mr. lagasse, i finally made it to delmonico's.  why might you ask?  well for one reason - the bone in aged rib-eye steak.\n\nthis was the third emeril restaurant that i've eaten at.  i used to live in new orleans and ate at his first restaurant, emeril's, and his casual outpost, nola, several times.  the food was good at times, not so great at other times, but the one thing that was constant was the excellent service.  \n\ndelmonico's continues that tradition.  the service is excellent.  at times, it's a little too friendly, but attentive and not overbearing.  food came out at a very good pace, allowing for long conversations without interruption.  and the decor is so understated and clean.  it really is a nice change from all of the typical vegas restaurants with loud lighting and faux-glam decor.\n\nbecause my girlfriend was so eager to try emeril's food (she's a big fan), we started off with some classics - barbecued shrimp (new orleans style) and <mark>Creole Boiled Gulf Shrimp Cocktail</mark> with remoulade sauce.  the lunch menu usually has shrimp remoulade over fried green tomatoes.  however, it wasn't on the menu and i really wanted my girlfriend to try it.  the waiter was nice enough to accommodate my request, learned they had some prepared and served it with the <mark>Creole Boiled Gulf Shrimp Cocktail</mark>.  to drink, she ordered a glass of loosen bros.  \"dr. l estate\" riesling and i ordered a glass of laurent perrier nv champagne. \n\nthe riesling was recommended by the asst. sommelier.  the waiter initially recommended an australian white blend.  but to me, it didn't seem like the best match with the barbecued shrimp because it lacked the acidity to cut the richness of the dish.  when i commented to the sommelier that i thought the australian white had viognier in it, he said it definitely did.  as we talked more, he said the riesling was a \"perfect match\" for the barbecued shrimp.  you know what?  it was.  my girlfriend wolfed down half of the barbecued shrimp, taking a sip of the riesling with each bite.  she even raved - it was a perfect match.  and she also loved the remoulade.  the barbecued shrimp were cooked well, i noticed one of the shrimp i had was a little tough, but the remaining shrimp were plump and juicy.  the <mark>Creole Boiled Gulf Shrimp Cocktail</mark> was great.  cold, large shrimp, moist, juicy and firm.  they were perfect with the remoulade sauce.\n\nfrom there, we split the bone-in rib eye which was cooked absofrigginlutely perfectly med-rare to med.  it wasn't charred, but had that crunch of a good high-temp seared steak.  the twice <mark>Baked Idaho Potato</mark> with bacon and cheese was sinfully great.  the asparagus was sauteed with garlic and shallots, cooked perfectly through with still a slight crunch.  we shared a half bottle of 2003 pine ridge crimson creek merlot which was a good match for the steak.  it had good balance, acidity, but enough soft fruit to please my girlfriend, who doesn't like tannic wines.\n\ndessert was banana cream pie for her, pecan pie for me.  both were excellent.  the banana cream pie wasn't as sweet as expected, which made it even more easy to eat.  she ordered an espresso martini made with espresso (not the flavored vodka), i ordered a glass of 2003 carmes de rieussec sauternes and finished with a cup of chicory coffee to finish.\n\nwas it inexpensive? of course not.  it was quite expensive.  but for the excellent quality of food (far, far, far better than gallagher's and probably the second best only to bouchon of the restaurants i've eaten at in vegas) and the best service i've had in vegas (yes, better than bouchon), it was worth it.  \n\nwhy 5 stars?  because everything went right.  was the service perfect? almost.  was the food perfect?  almost.  were the drinks perfect?  almost.  adding that all together with the right person i wanted to share the evening with, it was perfect.  (although i didn't ever finish my french laundry review, that place is nearly perfect with whoever you go with.  it is still to this day, the best eating experience i have ever had and i've had the fortune of going there 3 times now.)\n\nnow if i could only remember the name of the asst. sommelier, i would give him a shout out here.  \n\ni am once again a fan of emeril.  but please, no \"bam.\"", 
            "my bf and i were totally looking forward to dining at delmonico.  i like fancy dining, he likes meat, put it together and we usually go to a steakhouse.  however, i did look at the menu beforehand, and noticed there were no crab cakes.  i always have crab cakes before a filet!  so that's probably where the problem started.  i made a reservation a couple months in advance on open table, but even then i could only get a 5:30 rez.  i'm not sure of the entire layout, but it seemed like we were seated in a more private room, which was nice.  the areas we passed through were super loud (staff and wedding party of 20).  gorgeous giant leather seats.  we started off with the \"<mark>Creole Boiled Gulf Shrimp Cocktail</mark> with tomato horseradish sauce and homemade crackers\".  there was definitely some bam in the sauce.  very peppery and lingers.  the crackers were just as spicy, but why are crackers served anyway?  the shrimp itself didn't taste like it was prepared in any special way.  bf had a bone in strip.  i order one of the specials, kobe sirlon.  i'm sorry this had to be my first experience with kobe.  it was terrible.  pretty on the plate, thinly sliced, with sinewy strands running all through it.  i was mortified with all the chewing.  i partially blame myself.  i knew i should have stuck with my standard filet medium rare.  sigh.  and now i will probably never go back to delmonico.  the sides consisted of overly buttery <mark>Country Smashed Potatoes</mark> and tiny fried bay scallops (tasted past its prime to me).  we also ordered an additional side of asparagus, also too buttery.  emeril's banana cream pie was good though.  intricately placed bananas seemed to float between layers of banana cheesecake.  the service is decent, but a bit impersonal.  we made a huge stain on the white tablecloth with a piece of dropped meat, and i expected the server to make a joke at least.  total damage, including tip, no drinks, was $195.", 
            "incredible service! made a reservation even though it was after 4th of july weekend. i was glad we had one, it was still packed on a monday night! there were eight of us, my friend's daughter brought her new build a bear puppy, and the server brought a setting and high chair for the puppy! how cute is that?? we ordered a bunch of appetizers, the fried calamari was light and crisp, bbq shrimp's sauce was thick and sweet but yet savory, <mark>Creole Boiled Gulf Shrimp Cocktail</mark> should be named prawn cocktail, and the <mark>Butternut Squash Ravioli</mark> - again, it's the sauce that did it, yum. every time i see <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark>, i order it for the kids, they love it - creamy, velvety with chunks of lobsters. hubby had the ribeye steak, i had the <mark>Filet Mignon</mark>, took a bite of my friends' beef medallion and <mark>Colorado Rack of Lamb</mark>. i think the ribeye steak and lamb came out the winner. very juicy and tender, with a little bit burnt on the fat, perfection! we shared the banana cream pie, banana pudding, creme brulee for desserts. the pudding was no doubt the winner, the others are good, but if you can only order one, have the pudding. again, expensive, but money well spent. will come back again for sure!", 
            "the steakhouse is like most traditional steakhouses. the decor was very clean and contemporary. the hostesses weren't all that attractive and would rate about a 5-6 in my scale of looks and their demeanor looked as if they did not really care to be there at all. \n\nthe dining area is half filled with patrons and business people alike chatting away about their day and how excellent the steak was prepared the beautiful burgundy high leather chairs is a nice touch and their seating area is plush and soft. the booth seating is a high suede sofa like seating and the tables were all lined with clean white linens and set in standard of most fine dining establishments. \n\ni took my seat and i was greeted by the waiter and the captain and was asked about my choice of entree. i decided to go with their <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> and go with my good instincts that this would be the best choice. the chef prepared all the appetizers for a sampling. classic jumbo <mark>Creole Boiled Gulf Shrimp Cocktail</mark>, <mark>Truffle and Parmesan Potato Chips</mark>, classic <mark>Caesar Salad</mark>, fried calamari, and mixed green salad. \n\nthe classic jumbo <mark>Creole Boiled Gulf Shrimp Cocktail</mark> with a extremely spicy cocktail sauce wasn't as good as i expected. the shrimp were cooked well and the shrimp were presented beautifully, however, the spicy cocktail sauce did not please my taste buds or my nostrils for that matter. the sauce was like eating a handful of wasabi.\n\n the extremely addicting <mark>Truffle and Parmesan Potato Chips</mark> were excellent and should be ordered every time any patron enters this restaurant. the chips were drizzled with truffle oils and shaved parmesan cheese and each individual chip melted as you put them in your mouth. \n\nthe classic <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> had much to desire. the way the salad was prepared was not my idea of a good salad. it was literally a huge chunk of romaine lettuce with the heart in tact served with a plain and unappealing caesar dressing. i don't like how fancy restaurants can slap a big chunk of romaine lettuce on a plate and call it a classic <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> just to be different. don't mess with a good thing!\n\nthe fried calamari was ok at best, not my favorite but definitely worth a taste. the mixed green salad was a way a salad should be prepared and had just the right amount of dressing. the waiter was attentive and knew what drinks were ordered. the plates were cleared but seemed like sometimes dead plates were left around. not a good sign of service. \n\nthe entree finally came and the presentation could have been better but the filet was ammmmazing. the steak knife cut through the filet like a butter knife through room temperature butter. the steak was cooked to medium rare perfectly and encrusted with some new orleans style spices. i truly enjoyed the filet till the very last bite. one thing i do have to mention is the dessert. i would highly recommend the famous emeril's banana cake. this thing was pure heaven and was absolutely delicious. i could not even describe it in words if i even tried so i won't! so you will have to try it for yourself. \n\noverall the experience was good, food was good but not the best i have tried, and the service was ok by my standards, but my standards can be high. my favorite parts were the filet and the dessert, the appetizers once again could have been better with the exception of the <mark>Truffle and Parmesan Potato Chips</mark>, mmm! delicious! i would recommend this place for dinner or lunch, however, the price can be a little daunting. i was calculating the totals of a appetizer, entree, and dessert and was estimating about 70-100 dollars a person with tip. that can look a little scary for some people, but for the meal and experience i'd say that was definitely worth it! many thanks for reading. till next time.", 
            "i'm struggling to figure out why i am rating this four stars instead of five. i guess that five stars is perfection and nothing is perfect, right? \n\nwe (me, wife, and my parents) at here on sunday, august 2, at 7:00. we reserved via opentable and were promptly seated in a very nice location. even though the restaurant was busy the tables on either side of us were kept empty until we were leaving, which was a very nice touch. my wife and i, and my parents, were celebrating our wedding anniversaries, and i noted this with opentable. this was communicated to the restaurant and they treated us very nice. \n\nthe service was extremely good. each table is assigned three people: a head waiter, an assistant waiter, and a buser. all were very polite and professional. the buser was a bit green but that is ok; her mistakes were very minor. the head waiter was exceptional - i don't remember his name and i feel bad for not being able to call him out and recognize him here. the second waiter was also very good; again, i forget her name. \n\nvery good bread was brought to the table and a complimentary appetizer was served to us that consisted of a very yummy chicken salad. my wife and i ordered the table-side <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> and it was worth the $30. the table-side preparation is neat to watch, and she did a great job with it. the entire salad is made from scratch at the table. this caesar goes right to the top of my list as my very favorite caesar and almost makes up for the beat-down i got at the palazzo's craps table right before dinner. my dad ordered a <mark>Creole Boiled Gulf Shrimp Cocktail</mark> that looked excellent. \n\nmy dad and i both had the boneless rib eye and my mom and wife split the filet. it was all good; in fact, i could have used a smaller steak. the waiter said it was 14-16 ounces but this was definitely bigger. for sides we ordered the asparagus, which i don't eat, and the small potatoes with garlic, which were very good. \n\ni had a root beer float for dessert - i liked the fact that there were some old favorites on the dessert menu, including peach cobbler. \n\nwith two bottles of wine (at $65/bottle) we spent over $400 (before tip) on dinner but all agreed that it was money well spent. \n\nabout the only negative is the couple who brought a very small child (6 months?) into the restaurant with them. the baby wasn't doing well and cried somewhat - shame on the parents.", 
            "i have been on the lookout for the perfect filet for some time now.  my search has put this place on the top of my list.  after years of waiting i finally  was able to dine at the famed delmonico steakhouse in vegas.  i was promised by steak loving friends that the filet was so perfect you didn't need a knife to cut it.\n\nmy wife and i arrived a bit early so we could check out their bar.  the ambiance while very nice, was not what i had expected.  it was also not very busy which also threw me off a bit.  anyway, we sat at the bar and i ordered up my usual (goose martini with 3 blue cheese olives) and my wife ordered a glass of wine.  we chatted up the friendly bar tender, finished our drinks then headed into the main dining area to be seated.\n\nfirst we were given a ginormous wine list that took us 10 minutes to go through and another 10 minutes to decided what we wanted.  we settled on a very reasonably priced bottle and our waiter was not at all pissed that we didn't drop $100's on a bottle.\n\nfirst they bring you a small dinner roll/bread thing that was very unremarkable.  i liked it that they brought you a single roll so i couldn't eat 4 of them and ruin my dinner, but it just wasn't that good so i really didn't want more than one.  probably for the best though.\n\nfor an appetizer we shared the <mark>Creole Boiled Gulf Shrimp Cocktail</mark> which was excellent.  the shrimp were boiled in some creole stuff which gave them a very nice flavor.  they give you 4 large shrimp which is perfect for sharing although i could have eaten them all myself.  if you like super hot cocktail sauce then be sure to ask for a side of horseradish to heat it up some more.\n\nthen we had the <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> which is prepared tableside and is a 2 person portion.  while the salad was pretty good, i wouldn't order it again.  they add some spices to it that i just don't think belong in a salad and gave it an odd flavor.\n\nas per our steakhouse usual, my wife and i split the filet and we both thought it was excellent.  it wasn't perfect, but probably one of the best i have ever had.  it was cooked perfectly, had excellent flavor and the rub they used wasn't too overpowering.  the steak was very tender but not the cut-with-your-fork kind of tender i am looking for.  at 9oz it was a perfect size to split and not feel overly full after our meal.\n\nfor sides we ordered the veggie of the day (broccoli) and the <mark>Roasted Fingerling Potatoes</mark>.  i guess they were pretty good but i should have ordered a few of their less healthy options like <mark>Delmonico Creamed Spinach</mark> or mashed potatoes.  my wife was in charge of the sides this time but next time i'm ordering something good.\n\nmy wife and i are both suckers for desserts made in house so we had to try their pecan pie.  it was ok but i would try sometime else next time like the cheese cake.  i wasn't a fan of the crust but i was a fan of the size; it wasn't huge and was perfect for 2 people to share.\n\nafter dinner my wife ordered a decaf coffee and for some reason i had absinthe.  the after dinner drink menu caught my eye because it had like 5 different selections of absinthe which is very unique.  i asked if i could do a sampler of them all but they said no.  instead, i settled on one and it was very good.  i am not a very experienced absinthe drinker so i really couldn't tell you if it was any better than any other one but it was quite good......and strong.  i still have no idea why the heck i ordered it.\n\nmy entire delmonico experience was excellent.  our entire waitstaff crew (there had to be 4 people waiting on us) were fast, friendly and helpful.  the price for the steak was reasonable and comparable to other steakhouses, but everything else was pretty high.  anyway, i would definitely dine here again and honestly cannot wait to return.", 
            "not bad but there are more exciting dining adventures to be had in vegas.\n\nthe <mark>Emeril's New Orleans Barbecue Shrimp</mark> and <mark>Creole Boiled Gulf Shrimp Cocktail</mark> are great starters but the strong spice flavor do not pair well with wines.\n\nsince this place bills itself as a steakhouse, i thought i should give them a try.  the steaks are quality cuts and well aged but the subtle flavors that develop with aging are lost because of the creole seasoning.  once again, the seasoning does not pair well with most traditional steak wines.  try a full bodied red zin.\n\nservice is excellent.  prices are ok.  wine prices are also fair by vegas standards.\n\nunlike most restaurants, lunch is not a better deal than dinner.  prices are the same, you just have fewer choices.\n\nstill though, there is little wrong with delmonico.  well worth a try.", 
            "the food was average at best.  the exceptionally high prices and the quality of the dishes do not match up.  wife and i chose delmonico based on reviews.  we left disappointed. the service is what you would expect to find at any high end restaurant.  all of our dishes lacked flavor and the quality of the ingredients were not there as well.  i am really not sure how this place is so well reviewed.  coming from boston we could go out every night for three months for a fantastic dinner and never revisit the same restaurant.  with that maybe we are spoiled.  our bill for the two of us at the end of the night was $250.  being generous i would say that dinner was worth maybe a third of the cost.  \n\nthe next night we sat at the bar at seablue in the mgm for a couple of cocktails. i got talking with the bartender and told him about dinner the previous night.  he said \"ooh, i wouldn't go there.  i was there years ago and found it to be extremely overpriced and the food just not that good.  i've heard lots of people say not great things about their delmonico visit.\" coincidentally, if you are in the mgm during happy hour visit the seablue. <mark>Creole Boiled Gulf Shrimp Cocktail</mark> are $1 each and are huge.  coming from the east coast i wouldn't eat shrimp in the desert but on the bartenders recommendation we got some. they were excellent.\n\nif the restaurant wasn't in the venetian and visited by thousands of tourists i would guess it would go out of business rather quickly.", 
            "our group of 14 was staying at the venetian and delmonicos was our pick for a nice fancy dinner. since we had a night full of drinking ahead of us, we definitely didn't want to over-stuff our stomachs so each couple agreed to share a steak along with lots of appetizers and sides. \n\nto start off, some of us had the <mark><mark>Ahi Tuna</mark> and Salmon Tartare</mark>, wedged salad, baked oysters, french escargot, <mark>Creole Boiled Gulf Shrimp Cocktail</mark>, and <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark>. they were all quite tasty! \n\nthe bf and i shared a <mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark>. asked for medium rare but it came out medium well. i was disappointed since i really hate eating well done meat. luckily the flavoring itself was pretty delicious or i'd definitely have to have it recooked. i also had an addition of <mark>Pan Seared <mark>Foie Gras</mark></mark> as well - which was the absolute best part of my meal. the flavoring and texture was perfect and after my last bite, i found myself wanting more still!\n\nalong with our main entree, we had an order of almost every side they had listed on their dinner menu: <mark>Buttered Fresh Asparagus</mark>, <mark>Buttered Fresh Broccoli</mark>, <mark>Delmonico Creamed Spinach</mark>, sauteed <mark>Sauted Garlic Mushrooms</mark>, mash potatoes, <mark>Creamed Corn Gratine</mark>, and <mark>Potato Gratin</mark>. all the sides are meant to be shared family style and a scoop of each was more than plentiful to compliment your main course. i loved the creamed corn the most. \n\nas full i already was, i saw expresso creme brulee on their dessert menu so of course i couldn't pass up on that. glad i didn't either bc it was fantastic!\n\nservice was excellent and our three waiters were extremely attentive and helpful throughout our entire meal. overall, we had a pleasant dining experience. \n\n3.5 stars because my steak came out medium well instead of medium rare, but because the service was superb, 4 stars it is! next time, get my steak right please =)", 
            "best pecan pie ever!\n<mark>Creole Boiled Gulf Shrimp Cocktail</mark>, good but nothing special, i thought it would be more cajun. oysters fresh and the horseradish was so good! <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> very good. the steak was pretty good i had a <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> and my husband had the ribeye it was huge! everything was cooked well. i have had a better steak but it was good. the best thing was the dessert of pecan pie. i'm just going to go there for that!", 
            "had dinner on 6/26/13. this was the second time my wife and i dined at delmonico steakhouse. the 1st time i ordered the bone-in-ribeye and was disappointed because it had some gristle and was underwhelming to say the least. on this trip, the wife had the <mark>Organic Baby Mixed Greens Salad</mark> and the filet while i had the <mark>Creole Boiled Gulf Shrimp Cocktail</mark> and once again the bone-in-ribeye. we also shared an order of asparagus.\n\nthe filet was good - tender and nicely seasoned. my ribeye was disappointing, however. it was not very tender and didn't have much flavor for being dry-aged 2-3 weeks as per our waiter.\n\nthe service and atmosphere are on par with most of the other high-end steakhouses in vegas, but the steaks are not as good as those we have had at craftsteak, cut, n9ne, stripsteak, prime, or even stk. does not deserve more than 3 stars imo and even though it wasn't bad, it is not good enough for us to return especially with all the other choices in town.", 
            "this is what a steakhouse ought to be. located in the venetian/palazzo complex, it's divided into several rooms, all pleasantly decorated. the ambience is relaxed and friendly. the wait staff is attentive without being overbearing. there's none of the pretense you get at, say carnevino in the same hotel complex. there is a nice energy level but you can easily hear each other.\n\nwe brought a wine bottle from home and the wait staff was fine with it. they politely informed us of the corkage fee (a reasonable $30) without making us feel weird about having brought our own bottle the way some places do.\n\nwe started with a very tasty <mark>Creole Boiled Gulf Shrimp Cocktail</mark> to share. then i moved on to the piedmontese boneless strip steak, which was delicious. helen had the salmon, which was like butter. potatoes au gratin made a nice side.\n\neverything was perfectly cooked, impeccable in quality, and served with refined flair."

            "date: july 8, 2005\nlocation: the venetian resort hotel & casino, las vegas\ncorkage: $25/bottle\ncost: $450 - party of four (including tax, tip & corkage)\nreservation: 702.414.3737\nwebsite: www.emerils.com\n\nto my surprise, got a last minute reservation through opentable.com just a couple of days before the trip to vegas. so instead of fleming's, capital grille, or boa, the three other places i had thought about to kick off my friend's bachelor party weekend, this is where we end up for dinner on the friday night.\n\nthe four of us arrived about 15 minutes early and were promptly seated, busy but not completely packed.\n\nthe service was above average, but not warm, mechanical is the best word to describe. i asked for the three bottles of wine i brought to be decanted, which was no problem at all. no riedels, but nice enough stemware to pass.\n\nwe ordered an antipasto for the table to get started. i had the <mark>Classic Steak Tartare</mark> as the appetizer and had the dry-aged bone in rib steak as the entree.\n\nthe <mark>Classic Steak Tartare</mark> is the best presentation of such i've seen. tartare in the center with individual garnishes fanned out, completed with baguette toast points. flavor was good, but missing the bam element i expected.\n\nthe rib steak i ordered was suppose to be medium-rare, but was closer to a medium, which was fine by me, as i tend to like it somewhere in between the two. word of caution here, all four steaks we had at our table, the temperature were missed by close to one notch, rare = medium rare, medium-rare = medium...etc.\ngood piece of raw material, but the kitchen failed to make it stand-out. again, seasoning was lacking, salt and pepper can definitely be used more liberally.\n\nordered three desserts to pass around the table to finish the dinner, nothing interesting here to write home about.\n\nthe total including tax, tip and corkage came out to be $450 for the four of us, not a bad price tag especially considering we are in vegas.\n\nwith this outing, i think i am completely done with top name destination vegas restaurants. aureole, bradley ogden, \npicasso and now this, none has given me a desire to visit for a second time.", 
            "(jan/ 2006)\n\n<mark><mark>Ahi Tuna</mark> and Salmon Tartare</mark>-- take a back seat (for now), \"where's the beef? we shared the <mark>Classic Steak Tartare</mark> appetizer and it was good. \n\nnot remembering that we had dined at emeril's in orlando, i ordered gumbo. and as it turns out, it is the exact same gumbo that i had at emeril's restaurant in florida. go figure. we also had some fish sitting on a bed of what looked like, well, vomit. but nevertheless, the dish was good and the stringy fried potatoes on top were crunchy and tasty.", 
            "i really enjoyed the meal at delmonico's, but from the first impression to the last, i still felt that the ambience was a bit missing.  we walked by on our first day and toyed with the idea of going into the bar for the <mark>Classic Steak Tartare</mark> appetizer; this was on friday afternoon.  the bar seemed a bit reserved and not very happening, compared to the bars at b&b and others in the venetian/shops.  we kept looking.  then, when we had decided to go for a nice steak dinner on the sunday evening during our vegas trip, we looked at several options, including capital grille and cut, but this seemed the easiest, and most promising, given the amount of time we had.  we arrived ahead of our required arrival (10pm, we needed to arrive at 9:45) in more than enough time to get a pre-dinner drink at the bar.  the problem was, now their bar area was completely dead and looked somewhat like a closed coffee shop.  uh oh...  we opted for the bar across the way at b&b, which was very nice.  we came back for our meal.  waitress was very nice and professional; they seated us right away.  we got the tartare appetizer and the chateaubriand for two.  the tartare appetizer was good; uniquely served with not only a side of their own prepared mustard, but also chopped hardboiled egg, not raw, mixed in.  the tartare was quite good and attractively presented.  the chateaubriand was delicious, served tableside and cut there, with the <mark>Country Smashed Potatoes</mark> and the vegetable of the day, the green beans with drawn butter.  it was superb.  the meat was served approximately medium rare, slightly rarer in the thicker cuts.  the end cuts, of course, were slightly more well done.  it was a delicious meal for two and expertly seasoned.  we shared the cappuccino cheesecake for dessert which was a unique flavor combination of the cappuccino flavored cake, the hazelnut sauce/topping with the sugared lemon slice; the flavors all worked together, and the cheesecake was delicious.  i had wine (zinfandel) with dinner; excellent.  my husband got the mojito served with coca leaf syrup; also good.  overall the food was fabulous, the service stellar.  but, the ambience, a bit stiff, a bit stodgy; not as friendly as the palm in bh or at ruth's chris bh or morton's bh.  also the decor, a bit too expected, a bit too safe and upscale coffee-shop-ish.  the waitresses are also required to wear true menswear shirts and ties and i didn't particularly care for the masculinizing of a waitress just in an attempt for them to appear overly professional.  overall it ranks about a 4.25...i'd try it again, but there are too many steakhouses, and too little time.  a great meal, set us back over $200 for two with our drinks, appetizer, dessert and the chateaubriand.", 
            "i was the best man and thus we came to vegas, we saw, and we ate at delmonico's (among other things).\n\ntable for 13 men out on the town for my friend's bachelor party.\n\ni can't remember what everyone ordered but i can tell you that nobody complained about the food (not drunk yet and therefore enjoyed the food fully).\n\nthe <mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark> was marvelous.  the calamari was good as was the <mark>Classic Steak Tartare</mark>. side dishes: new orleans <mark>Delmonico Creamed Spinach</mark>, <mark>Truffle and Parmesan Potato Chips</mark> and saut\\u00e9ed <mark>Sauted Garlic Mushrooms</mark> were all excellent!  the sides are quite large so please share because yeah, we ordered too many.\n\ntotal bill for 13 (which included some drinks) was about $1100 which is not bad for a nice high-end place that serves the best ribeye.  if you like porterhouse, then go try the porterhouse at keens steakhouse in nyc.", 
            "we went here while in town for the halloween weekend. never even heard of the place, but figured why not give it a shot.\n\nthe decor is upscale, but pretty boring actually. no flare at all to it. \n\nhere is what i either ordered or tried:\n\n<mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> - very good. creamy and rich, yet the lobster came through right away.\n\n<mark>Classic Steak Tartare</mark> - good.had a bit too much mustard sauce for me, as that was about all i could taste. but the meat had alot of flavor.\n\nlamb chops - very well done. the lamb was cooked well(medium rare) and was nice and juicy. \n\ni ordered the ribeye(rare). i thought it was on the verge of medium rare, but totally acceptable. nice flavor, and good portion. not the best steak i have had, especially since the waiter said it was both wet and dry aged. \n\nsauteed spinach - very good, but i would have preferred a bit more creaminess to it. although i am not sure if it was supposed to be cream spinach or not, it seems almost like it was halfway between steamed and creamed. either way it was a very good side dish.\n\nfilet - very well cooked and tender. i found the truffle crust lacking in flavor though, as i could not really taste it at all.\n\nand i want to say halibut, but i could be off. either way, the special fish entree was probably the best of the night. cooked just right, and the sauce was excellent.\n\noverall i liked the dinner alot. for the price though it was nothing all that special.", 
            "came here for thanksgiving dinner. the place is nice, spacious, classy, definitely serve the older crowd/family scene. food was good, nothing to complain about but nothing that wow-ed us. although i must say the <mark>Classic Steak Tartare</mark> was awesome!\n\none thing to note, i didn't like the fact that the servers/hostess looked at my bf and i like we can't afford this or something, not sure if it's because we are young couple. it just have that weird/uncomfortable feelings. we were well-dressed and have the proper table ,manners etc. weird feelings. (i still give it 4 star for the service and food though)", 
            "i usually love delmonicos but my last trip kept me wanting more. maybe i was too hungover to thoroughly enjoy my meal, but on this blurry saturday night everything was very mediocre for me. we started off with the <mark>Classic Steak Tartare</mark> and the bbq shrimp. the <mark>Classic Steak Tartare</mark> was very good. it was fresh, clean and delicious. the bbq shrimp was good, but for $18 for 4 shrimps, i wanted them to be a party in my mouth, and in this case, they were not. i ordered a medium rare rib eye. it was cooked to absolute perfection. nice crust and juicy pink center. i marveled at the perfection of my steak. although it was slightly under seasoned it was still juicy and delicious.\n\ndelmonico's is probably one of the best if not thee best steakhouses i've been to. their service is spectacular and on point every time i've been. they really do hire the best of the best. attentive but not overbearing servers.  delmonicos puts out some amazing and good quality food. if you go, you must try their <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark>, it's luscious, creamy and definitely worth the calories. <mark>Potato Gratin</mark> is definitely one of their best sides also. and of course, don't every steer from what you came for, the steak!\n\nemeril, you slightly let me down this time, but i still remember how good you've been to me the last times. i'll be back to let you redeem yourself.",

            "my experience is from dining at the bar. i never discount the bar as an option for a wonderful evening. it honestly is the best way for a single diner or even two people to enjoy a nice evening without the pretense of an uppity experience.\n\nmy friend and i came to delmonico, dressed in tank tops and jeans, so we found an open spot up front. the bartenders are friendly and just as polished as any server. the recommendations for red pairing with our bone in ribeye to the port at the end was perfection. we started our meal off with the <mark>Classic Steak Tartare</mark>. it has to be the second best in the city. i wished they would use a quail egg to dress it instead of a chicken's. moving on to our entree, we split the ribeye and it was more than enough for the both of us. add a side of the haricot vert with sauteed shallots and it is the perfect meal. being in an emeril restaurant we we had to finish with one of his specialty desserts. i tend to not be a big pie fan, so we went with the bread pudding. it is decadent and comes in a generous portion. no one person should be able to polish one off on their own. \n\nthis is one of those restaurants were i would not even bother with getting a table and would prefer to eat out at the bar.",

            "beyond food coma...it's food paralysis!  the itis ain't got nothin' on this.\n\ni had my preconceptions of the food here but i put them away for a short time and figured i'll try anything once.  dinner started with some bread with butter and munched on the <mark>Truffle and Parmesan Potato Chips</mark>.  they were very oily, warm, crunchy, savory, and tangy in flavor.  we did not make a dent in them.  the appetizer was soon followed by the <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> and <mark>Traditional New Orleans Gumbo</mark> with chicken and andouille sausage.  the <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> was really intense in flavor.  it had an almost bitter flavor but so rich like condensed sweet buttery lobster in sea water.\n\nthe protein that night was the <mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark> which we split.  perfectly cooked to medium, it had a nice crust on the outside and had a big glob of butter on top.  i immediately scraped the butter off and put it on the side but a lot of it had already melted onto the plate or penetrated the meat.  the meat was thick, tender, juicy, had perfect grill marks on the outside, and smelled floral due to the either rosemary or thyme sprigs.  accompanying the main dish was the <mark>Pan Seared <mark>Foie Gras</mark></mark>.  yes, i had to try the duck (or goose) liver.  it was indeed buttery, silky, melt in your mouth tender and a good sized piece at that.  like everything else here, it was seared in butter and had a salty, buttery crust to it.\n\nas for the sides, we had sauteed garlic wild mushrooms and the <mark>Creamed Corn Gratine</mark>.  the mushrooms were delightful.  i loved forking up different varieties that i had no idea what they were.  they just tasted great.  the garlicky, buttery flavor and tender yet almost slippery texture makes this dish my favorite of the night.  the creamed corn also exhibited buttery flavor so much i think it was in a bath of butter and heavy cream.\n\nyou couldn't have all this great food without wine and they have an impressive wine menu indeed.  i went with that i know and got the syrah.  toward the end of the meal it hit me.  the wall...of carbs, butter, salt, cholesterol, all in a sluggish soup coursing though my veins like molasses.  i feel my heart straining to pump the blood with heavy thumps and i feel the arteries of my wrist bumping against the table.  my body starts to get lethargic - i don't wanna move, no i can't move - as i gaze blankly over the huge leftovers of corn and butter.  this is beyond food coma, i need a blood transfusion i thought.  need i be more dramatic?  my preconceptions were right.\n\non the bright side, the service is impeccable here and everyone seems to to take their job seriously and sincerely.  it is a bit of a formal atmosphere but you don't feel like you're in las vegas for the short time you're there.", 
            "** 100th review ** \n\ni had been anticipating this lunch for a few days. delmonico has been a favorite of mine but i hadn't dined there for a year. and, i was meeting esteemed london yelper yee gan o., who was on one of his dining and roller coaster trips across america. talking with yee gan was great. in fact, our conversation was so animated that our server asked if we wanted him to remain away, because we were discussing business. i told him that it wasn't business we were discussing, and he was thus welcome to hover over us. but, besides the consistency of the bearnaise sauce, the one complaint i have is that on this outing the waitstaff did not come close to hovering. i had to ask for a second roll, iced tea refills occurred but not too frequently, and an empty butter dish remained empty. this was in sharp contrast to my earlier visits to delmonico where i could barely get a glass down to half full before it was refilled, and when a new roll appeared as soon as an old one disappeared. the restaurant was not very crowded at all, so being too busy could not legitimately account for the laggard service. it wasn't so much our server but our assistant server who fell down on the job. he was responsible for refilling glasses, resupplying rolls, and making sure sufficient butter was available on the table. \n\nnow on to the meal itself! my <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> was very smooth, creamy, and flavorful, with a few morsels of sweet lobster to nibble on as garnish. it was all i hoped for! the <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> that followed was better than i expected. it was very tasty, with very fresh romaine lettuce leaves and long croutons that when broken spread cheesy garlic flavor all over the lettuce, to join with the parmesan splinters that were liberally spread over all. it was an excellent dish! \n\nmy <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> looked forlorn on the plate. only a large pat of maitre d' butter appeared beside it. a little pink blood was also pooled on the plate beneath the meat, which to me was a good sign. the prime grade filet was cooked almost all medium rare to order, but a few spots were closer to medium, and the steak was more peppery than i prefer. otherwise it tasted very good. it could have tasted even better had i not forgotten to order bearnaise sauce until the steak arrived at our table. that was my fault, and it probably contributed to the drama that followed. but the filet on my plate was not a $50 steak, which is what i paid for it. for that price--especially at lunch--i expect the filet to be great. this one was very good but not great. its size was not listed, but it was no more than 8 oz. \n\nour server immediately put in the order for bearnaise sauce, but it did not arrive for several minutes. he then made a point of telling me that the chef makes bearnaise sauce to order, and was preparing a new batch for me. a few minutes later, as i chipped away at more steak without any sauce, still no sauce had appeared. so i ate more of my steak, which was at least still tasty standing on its own. then the bearnaise sauce at last arrived, but it was runny and not very flavorful. it looked like it needed to set longer, so i left it alone for about two minutes, but the consistency remained thin after then. again, my tardiness in ordering the sauce probably caused the chef to rush its preparation, so i take partial responsibility for an imperfect bearnaise on this occasion. let this be a lesson to all diners: order bearnaise sauce when you order your steak--not when it arrives! \n\nas i ate my steak, i looked longingly at yee gan's lobster sliders, which looked delectable. but i'll let him report on that as well as the <mark>Traditional New Orleans Gumbo</mark> that he also ordered, which looked delicious as well, and that i have enjoyed before. but delmonico is first and foremost a steakhouse, and i wanted to review one of its steaks. (however, i may slip in again soon and order lobster sliders on my next lunch outing there.) \n\nmy side of <mark>Country Smashed Potatoes</mark> was a smash hit, with creamy red-skinned potatoes with a little of the skin showing, a few circles of green onion sprinkled on top, and including some very tasty lumps of potato that quickly dissolved in the mouth. i was going to take the remaining uneaten half of this quite large side dish home, it tasted so good--but forgot to do so, for which i am still kicking myself. for dessert, yee gan and i split a generous slice of emeril's renowned banana cream pie, which was top-heavy with whipped cream, filled with luscious pieces of banana, and also bedecked with chocolate shavings and caramel sauce. as i savored each bite, i tried to conjure up how to best describe the taste of this concoction, and one word stood out: \"heavenly.\" the only comparable banana cream pie i have eaten is the last one i had at delmonico. and, this one was better by a shaving. \n\noverall, a very good lunch with great company!", 
            "you know the expression about sailors having a woman in every port. well, on my recent trip to the usa, i had yelpers in every town to host, entertain and amuse!\n\nvegas elite dennis t was my lunch companion when i was in town. not only was he gracious enough to clear some time in his busy schedule to have lunch with me but i was honoured that he made our meal together his 100th review\n\ndennis gave me a list of tempting options for lunch. i had to watch how much i was going to have for lunch as i had a dinner reservation at raku that evening for the kaiseki menu but the lobster sliders at delmonico caught my eye, so that was my choice.\n\ni had a nice time wandering through the venetian on my way to delmonico. the size and scale of u.s. buildings in general amaze me but the venetian is certainly very ornate and i enjoyed looking at the menus while walking down restaurant row on the way to delmonico\n\ni instantly recognised dennis from his yelp picture and like all the yelpers i've met, conversation flowed like we were old friends. so much so that unusually for yelpers, we were chatting so much that ordering took awhile as we hadn't look at the menu the first few times that our waiter approached to take our order\n\nthe restaurant is certainly decked out to appeal to the higher end of customer. it was a quiet lunch service when we dined and while it provided a good ambiance for chatting, i perhaps didn't see delmonico as the busy celebrity chef steakhouse that it is.\n\ni had already decided on my main course of lobster sliders and using my personal rule of taking the opportunity of eating foods that i don't come across often, i paired that with an appetiser of <mark>Traditional New Orleans Gumbo</mark>. i'm not in any position to comment on the authenticity of the gumbo but as emeril lagasse started his celebrated celebrity chef trail with his first restaurant emeril's in new orleans, i'm guessing he can cook a good gumbo. mine was certainly pungent with a great depth of flavour from a carefully stock. being asian, i was also impressed to see that the rice had been cooked well\n\ndennis was pleased with his appetiser of <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> followed by <mark>Caesar Salad</mark>\n\nit may seem odd to eschew steak at a steakhouse. however, i've always liked the sound of lobster roll but still haven't tried one yet. i saw these lobster sliders as the nearest i could get until i make my trip to the northeast to try a real lobster roll. well, the sliders were excellent - soft rolls containing morsels of sweet lobster meat mixed with the right amount of mayonnaise and seafood dressing.\n\ndennis however wasn't quite as lucky with his fillet steak, which arrived looking rather lonely on the plate. dennis decided to order some bearnaise to correct this loneliness but it took a long time to appear and when it did, it seemed a bit watery.\n\nin an effort to not be too piggy, dennis and i split the banana cream pie. well, the combination of banana, pie, whipped cream, caramel and chocolate shavings pleased my palate probably more than my arteries! i don't have a really sweet tooth but i really enjoyed this\n\ndennis was kind enough to give a lift back to my hotel down the strip, which gave me a good touristy view of the sights\n\na friendship sealed. a celebrity chef ticked off. lobster sliders consumed. a most successful lunch rendezvous indeed!", 
            "i have not written a yelp review in over two years, however after having delmonico's i felt compelled to dig up the old yelp account to share my experience.\n\ni loved the atmosphere. it had a very nice ambiance to it. the lighting was dim and the decor was simple. attire was dressy/casual. \n\nstarting with apps, we had the oysters and <mark>Pan Seared <mark>Foie Gras</mark></mark>. the oysters were exceptionally fresh. no complaints about the <mark>Pan Seared <mark>Foie Gras</mark></mark>. i also had the <mark>Traditional New Orleans Gumbo</mark> which was good, but i'd pass on the next time around.\n\nmain courses - <mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark> was fantastic. the seasoning was great and the steak itself was cooked to perfection. the portion was huge. (like bigger than my face huge!) it was one of the best steaks i've had.\n\nsides - i would highly recommend the sauteed garlic wild mushrooms and the twice <mark>Baked Idaho Potato</mark>. they went perfectly with the steak. both had good flavor and were prepared just right.\n\ndesserts - the duck egg creme brulee was good. it was creamy and had just the right amount of sweetness to it. i would also recommend the white chocolate macadamia nut bread pudding - it was scrumptious! \n\ni would say expect to spend about $100/pp. overall i very pleased with my experience here - from the atmosphere, to service to food; excellent delivery. \n\nkudos emeril!", 
            "had dinner reservations at 6:30pm and we were seated right away.\n\ni looked at their menu prior to stepping foot into the restaurant so i kind of had an idea of what i would like to order.\n\nfor our appetizer, we ordered two parmesan and garlic <mark>Truffle and Parmesan Potato Chips</mark>. i'm a chip queen....obsessed and in love with chips but this....this didn't taste that great. =/ the first five chips were good...but after awhile...it tasted way too greasy. you know that over greased taste? yeah...that's what i was starting to taste. it felt like they drenched the entire thing in oil and left it there for days. my party finished the first plate of that but we just couldn't finish the second plate. i definitely would not order this again. \n\n<mark>Traditional New Orleans Gumbo</mark>: this gumbo had rice, chicken, sausage and veggies. pretty good sized portion for a bowl of soup. small eaters would be half full from this. seriously...lol. i thought to myself...damn...i hope i have enough room in my stomach for my entree!!!\n\n<mark>Caesar Salad</mark>: typical normal caesar. it's big enough to share with your entire party.\n\nboneless rib-eye: you have your choice on the menu for bone-in or boneless rib eye. i was with a fancy date and his party of four other high rollers so i didn't wanna make a mess, that's why i opted for boneless. i've got to admit...it was good...but to be technical, i would rate it at a solid b grade. my rib eye was cooked to my liking, the flavoring was delicious but......there were more fatty parts that i would like. =/ eh...not a big fan. but it didn't take away from the complete meal. great rib eye...big enough for leftovers the next day.\n\nnote: three out of the six steak entrees my party ordered was over cooked. someone wanted medium rare but her steak came out medium. my date ordered medium and it pretty much came out medium well.\n\nfor our side dishes we ordered potatoes au gratin, asparagus, mashed potatoes, and another veggie dish.\n\ncan't go wrong with delmonicos. def give it a try! be sure to make reservations.", 
            "this time, for dinner, emeril's employees took it up a notch, and diane and i enjoyed a five-star dining experience here.  we were initially served an amuse bouche of bruschetta, tomato, mozzarella, & balsamic followed by an ordered starter of <mark>Emeril's New Orleans Barbecue Shrimp</mark> that came with a light petite rosemary buttermilk biscuit and strong, heavy bbq sauce.\n\nwhile diane enjoyed a bowl of <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> with maine lobster garnish, i savored the vibrant contrasting flavors of <mark>Traditional New Orleans Gumbo</mark> with shrimp & andouille sausage.  then it was time for our mains.\n\nwhile diane worked on a petite filet without char, i applied myself to a 9-ounce lightly charred <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> cooked perfectly medium rare as ordered, with a large pat of maitre d' butter melting slowly over the top.  both steaks came with classic yorkshire pudding, which tasted best after being rubbed in meat juices that ran slightly on the plate.  the meat melted in the mouth, aided by dipping in either a quite tasty homemade worcestershire sauce or drinkable b\\u00e9arnaise sauce.  i also topped my towering rectangle of beef with a side of sauteed garlic wild mushrooms, which included multiple varieties.  we also shared a large side of very cheesy and crusty <mark>Potato Gratin</mark>.\n\nfor dessert, for us there was no choice.  it was foreordained.  no one makes banana cream pie better than emeril lagasse!  one slice of emeril's banana cream pie was easily enough for both me and my spouse to share.  together we delighted in this rich confection of ripe banana chunks set in layers like a brick wall with sweet cement, and adorned with chocolate shavings, whipped cream, and caramel sauce.  mellow decaffeinated arabica coffee served in a french press just further enhanced the end of this fine meal.  seating was very comfortable in a half-booth, and service was both professional and knowledgeable. \n\nwe will surely return for more of the same!", 
            "very busy and noisy restaurant.\nasparagas was cooked perfectly, however quite flavorless. the mashed potatoes were tasty.  \nfor the price, the spinach should have been fresh and the cream sauce needs improvement. \nmy organic filet was good and nicely cooked to medium rare, however not near as tasty as other organic beef i have had for half the price.\nthe <mark>Traditional New Orleans Gumbo</mark> was a tad too salty.  the yorkshire style buns were average and were cold.  \nthe key lime pie was average.  the tartness was lacking.  the apple pie was a disappointment, with a doughy flavoured crust.\nanother thing that  high end restaurants need to learn is how to choose great coffees like good wines.  i asked where the beans were from and they had no idea.  i would expect excellence in all areas of my food consumption and yes, even with my coffee. the espresso was extremely poor.\nthis is a restaurant that is way overpriced for average to good tasting food.  nothing was outstanding or excellent.\nso i can only give it a rating of 2 combining value and flavour."

            "i am going to preface this review by saying that we were given free desserts and a special appetizer from the chef. this was due to my sister knowing the general manager as she was a vegas concierge for many years. that being said, i thought the meal experience was outstanding.\n\nwe were celebrating an anniversary and there were seven of us including a 7 year old. the waiter brought the aforementioned free appetizer, a steak and blue cheese  croquette and <mark>Pan Seared <mark>Foie Gras</mark></mark> with cherry compote. not bad. i started with the baby greens with fried mozzarella. the lettuce was decent, the mozzarella cold and disappointing. \n\ni asked a waiter, not ours, what she recommends and she said easily the rib eye in bone. it saved the meal. as juicy as any steak i've ever had, and spiced to perfection with a dollop of butter melting on top. my wife enjoyed the 2 pound lobster and had started with the <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> which she also devoured. the sides were ok. i had the twice <mark>Baked Idaho Potato</mark> with bacon and cheese, but also sampled the french fries, which they specially made for the 7 year old, and they were quite good.\n\ndessert, since it was free, was a virtual sampler platter. the pecan pie was excellent. the bread pudding was disapponting - i've never tried it with cubed up bread with sauce on top and not enough to reach the bottom and served with oreo ice cream and chocolate magic shell. i sampled three flavors of ice cream and gelato and disliked them all, they tasted like ice milk.\n\nthe service was impeccable. never a want. and the price was not bad, $325 for 7 people but if i included the freebies then it would have touched $400. bottom line is i'd go back if staying at the venetian but would try others if not.", 
            "i've been to this restaurant 3 times in the last 4 years.  the first time was amazing.  the bbq shrimp appetizer had big delicious shrimp, the steak was super tender and cooked just right and the service was impeccable, servers are there just when you want them and not more.  also, the sommelier made an excellent wine suggestion that was reasonably priced.\n\nmy friends and i liked the place so much after the first time that we kept talking about going back the next time we were in vegas.  the place was crowned as the place to go for our annual vegas outing.  \n\nunfortunately, the next two times i came back were utter disappointment.  the second time, i took my then fiancee.  we ordered the <mark>French Onion Soup</mark>, the bbq shrimp and i had a rib-eye.  i forget what she had as an entree.  the <mark>French Onion Soup</mark> was gross, it tasted like dish water.  so we asked the waiter to bring us the <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> instead.  it took us too long to find our server though.  to their credit, they took the french onion off of our tab.  the <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> was not special, very bland even for <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark>.  the shrimp came out very poor, the bbq sauce tasted burnt and the shrimp were small.  and to top the night off, my steak was medium well almost well done, when i had asked for medium rare.\n\nthe third time, i went with my friends.  the wine suggestion was poor and it was tres expensive.  also, the food was just as mediocre as the second time i went.\n\ni give the place two stars despite the food being ok, because of the price.  also, i think the service has gotten weaker since my first visit.  hopefully, this place can get back into fighting form, but i won't know because i doubt i'll be coming back.", 
            "where to start....\nhad a party of 4. started with the <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> soup, was a little too salty, but was tasted pretty good. with the main meal it took a while to get and when we got it, the steak that i had ordered ~medium~ was more like extra rare still kicking, and after taking the first bite out of it, it was already luke warm. after telling the waiter about the steak he took it and brought it back, medium rare, still bloody. i didn't think it was possible to mess up on a steak twice in a row, but oh well. the side dish's were asparagus, garlic mashed potatoes, spinach, and garlic mushroom. just like the steak it got cold too fast, as well as the side dish's, however the garlic mashed potatoes, and the mushrooms were good while they were warm. the spinach would have tasted better if it had come from a can and the asparagus was nothing special, just expensive asparagus!\n\noverall:\nthe food needs to be served on hot plates!\nthe service was awesome, and that was probably the best quality of the restaurant.", 
            "went there with co-workers because one of them had a craving for steak. we should've gone to just a whatever steakhouse that you could have for less than $20.\n\ntheir bone-in steak ran about $48. their appetizer salad special of the day (which i had as an entree) was $20. don't believe what the vegas tourist book says. it said it's \"$$\", where in actuality was more like \"$$$$\". i don't think i'd go there again. my friend said his <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> soup was just \"okay\" and not as good as another, less expensive place. he said it was bland and not much flavor to it. their twice-<mark>Baked Idaho Potato</mark> was pretty good, but i can imagine how unhealthy it is for you. \n\ntheir setting is nice though - dimly lit in some parts of the restaurant. great for couples or dates. and if you want to go there, make sure it's something special like a birthday or anniversary. that's probably the only time i'd go back if i ever went back.", 
            "tip on ordering steak:\nif you want a bigger cut of meat, get it rare to medium-rare.  \notherwise, if you order your meat medium-well, you get a smaller cut in order for it to cook well in the middle\n\ni couldn't decide on a steak that night, and i wanted a little variety.  so i ordered a combination of 2 appetizers and a soup.\n\nsoup: <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> was awesome mainly because they weren't stingy with the lobster meat.  often when you order a seafood soup (e.g. clam chowder) they dump a lot of potatoes or other filling in there.  not the case with this bisque.  a must for any bisque or lobster connoisseur.\n\nappetizer 1: <mark>Butternut Squash Ravioli</mark> w/duck was very tasty, and again, not stingy with the duck, which kind of looked like pulled pork but with duck meat.\n\nappetizer 2: crawfish meat w/crystal pepper sauce over linguine could have been a small meal in itself.  and just the right amount of that crystal hot sauce to give it a solid southern kick.  this was probably my favorite.\n\ni did have a taste of the various meats too including the t-bone and <mark>Filet Mignon</mark>, both of which i recommend.  you don't get anything with it, so unless you just want meat, you'll probably need to order a side dish or two.",

            "i love everything about this steakhouse.  i waited until after our second visit to write a review just to be accurate...our meal was perfect yet again.   as we were celebrating my birthday on our latest visit, the waiter treated us to a lovely, complimentary first course of duck pate.  we then ordered the popular bbq shrimp as an appetizer along with the <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark>.  the shrimp dish consisted of 4 very flavorful large prawns and  the bisque was to die for.   now on to the meat... it was cooked to perfection, a red warm center.  definitely one of best steaks i have ever had, hands down.    as we wrapped up the dinner, the waiter brought out a complimentary dessert of chocolate sorbet over a waffle flat bread.  the service was impeccable.  we literally had three waiters, 1 head, and 2 assistants.  i would absolutely recommend this establishment to anyone interested in a memorable dining experience.", 
            "this place was delicious and the staff was very friendly and helpful.  my favorite favorite thing was the <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark>.  it had a empanada like thing in the soup packed with lobster. \n\nif only i could find that here....", 
            "went here with some friends while my husband and i were having our couple's shower in vegas prior to our wedding. his best man raved about the restaurant, so we decided to give it a go.\n\nwe made a reservation for the first seating, but they weren't quite ready for us when we got there, so we sat in the bar area and ordered a couple of drinks. i got a very good pino noir, though i can't recall where it was from.\n\nwhen it was time to be seated, we were escorted to our table through a line of wait staff. honestly, it was a bit uncomfortable walking through all those people. once we got to our table, our server came over and gave us menus. both the server and her assistant were pleasant enough, though i don't know i would go as far as saying there were \"friendly.\"\n\nwe all ordered our starters and make courses, plus a couple of sides. i got the <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark>, which i wasn't all that impressed with. i had better <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> on cruise ship. it was a bit salty and the way they presented it was a bit tacky, in my opinion.\n\nwhen the entrees came, everything was fine. the steak was good, but i don't know that i would ever pay $50+ for it again. i asked for medium, and i got medium rare. which was fine for me, but one of my friends had the same problem, and it kinda grossed her out. so she had to send it back. the server got the problem fixed very quickly, and it was perfect the second time around.\n\ni did like that they came with some sauces. the bearnaise was very good and my husband devoured the peppercorn sauces. the sides were all good, but not as big as we had anticipated. our waiter said they should feed 3-4 people. however, when you have two 250+ pound guys with you, it was not enough.\n\nthe desserts were fantastic. i had the creme brule, which was perfect. soft and creamy, with a yummy hard shell on the top. i would order that again in a heart beat. and we all felt the deserts were very reasonably priced for what we received. definitely big enough for 2 people to share.\n\noverall, 3 starts. everything was good and probably would have gotten 4 stars, if not for the price of everything. when you pay that much for food, you expect to be wowed. and we just weren't. but no major complaints either.", 
            "<mark>Lobster Bisque</mark>, spinach salad and wild mushrooms.  yum, yum and yum.\n\nribeye.  large portion perfectly med rare, but too \"saucy\" (not sure why they feel butter is necessary on such a flavorful cut that should be able to stand on its own.)  truthfully, i've had better ribeye on our backyard grill.\n\nlamb.  overcooked and also too saucy.  not sure what that flavorless choux puff was about...\n\ntook two bottles of wine, but only got charged 1 corkage.  nice.\n\nif i ever go back - which i doubt i will - i'll stick to the non meat items.  guess for a steak house that's not high praise....", 
            "the boy picked delmonico's because he loves steak ad i didn't want to leave the hotel. now, in all honesty, i wasn't my normal foodie self, i wasn't really that hungry, so maybe i'm not giving it a fair review....but....\nwe arrived 5 minutes late for our reservation, and were greeted by the host with a little attitude, but in all fairness, i was in heels hiking miles to get to this place, give me a break! after he made a point of stating the time, and the time our reservation was, we were escorted to our table. the decor almost feels cave-like, which worked for a steakhouse. the place was packed and it took a little longer than fine dining protocol allows for to get our menus. our waitress was a sweetheart and made suggestions for us, although she seemed swamped with tables. \ni decided on the <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> and the petite fillet mignon. the <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> was ok, nothing special, which was sad, since i watch the food network 24/7 and love emeril, (i expected more from his restaurant). my fillet was a little overcooked for medium rare, and really had nothing special about it. no flavor to set it apart from a fillet i'd get from costco and make on the grill myself. the boy loved his steak, so i guess the meal was a success, but having been to n9ne, i wouldn't come back here. the prices are high, and the food is just good, not world changing like vegas fine dining should be.",

            "delicious! but i was way too full from eating the days before to completely enjoy this place.\n\nwe started out with calamari and crab cakes. im not that into calamari but i thought the crab cakes were wonderful. the <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> was super rich and creamy. yum. and it comes with what i thought was bread, but when you stir it into the soup, the bread somehow melts into great big chunks of lobster.\n\neverybody got steak and i went with the <mark>Ahi Tuna</mark>, cuz i figured i could just get a taste of their steak. that didn't really go to plan cuz i just ended up eating everyone else's steak, especially my friend's bone in rib steak (med rare). hehe. but the tuna was still very good.\n\nended dessert with the bread pudding and creme brulee. i liked the bread pudding more because it was hot and it was topped off nicely with ice cream.", 
            "the <mark>Traditional New Orleans Gumbo</mark> was tasteless, the <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> was too salty, the jumbo lump crab salad was anything but fresh, the bbq shrimp was swimming in bbq sauce......, we were amazed by the poor quality of food this restaurant serves, we ordered great wine and that's the only thing we finished, service was o.k.  i would skip this restaurant altogether.",

            "quite delicious! i wouldn't say that this steakhouse is creative or unique, but what i will say is that it's classic, delicious and savory. the decor is comfortable, quietly & minimally luxurious and the service was very good without being intruding. i was dining with my family (sister, mom, father and my husband russ). \n\nfor an appetizer, i ordered the <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> which was very good but not super memorable and for the entree, i ordered the surf and turf. perfection. i found everything to be just as i ordered it and savored every last piece of my meal. we got the bacon-cheddar polenta which was remarkably good and the mashed potatoes (which i didn't try) and also, the <mark>Delmonico Creamed Spinach</mark>. it may not be revolutionary, but delmonico's does good food just right :d\n\ni wouldn't say that i really \"stepped out of my box\" with what i ordered, but i will say that they have a wonderful wine list, a nice group of people working for them, and tasty food. this is the perfect place to dine with a small group or family where everyone can get something they like. it's more of a safe bet while dining in vegas - but a good one. it's also located in the venetian - which is as they say - a \"feast for the eyes\" i like!", 
            "we got here at 730pm with reservations at 8pm, so we waited for a little bit in their \"lounge.\" here, i asked for water, and the waitress gracefully brought me a glass, even though we were probably expected to order an alcoholic beverage. we waited about 15 minutes in their lounge, and then a waitress took us to our seats. the restaurant was surprisingly large, and we were seated in the middle of the back room. i was surprised at the decor, it was rather.. plain.  plain white walls with dim lighting.. it kind of felt like we were just being seated in a large room. after sitting, the waiter explained to us about the menu, and then left a very large book of alcoholic beverages for us to look over as well.  the menu wasnt too large, which was good for indecisive people like us. :)\n\nto start, we ordered a <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> ($12.50) to share, esp after reading the rave reviews about it here. like i said, not hyped. it was sensational. it was so smooth, creamy, and rich, mmm.. i'm drooling right now just thinking about it. for our entrees, i ordered the <mark>Colorado Rack of Lamb</mark> ($48) with a side of <mark>Roasted Fingerling Potatoes</mark> ($9), and the friend ordered one of their specials of the night--blue cheese covered bone-in filet with bacon ($55) with a side of saut\\u00e9ed <mark>Sauted Garlic Mushrooms</mark> ($9). i'll start with the sides. the potatoes were okay.. nothing too spectacular.. a little bit on the salty side.. but it was a good side if you need veggies (or veggie-related) along with your meat. the mushrooms were good. tasty, cooked nicely, and i dont even like mushrooms! i ordered the lamb cooked to medium, and it was still slightly too red for me, but it was good nonetheless. a little bit on the fatty side, but it was tasty, and came with a popover.. which is this egg-battered bread thing that went really well with the lamb sauce. i actually had a bite of the friend's steak before i dug into my lamb, and boy.. that steak was fabulous! the blue cheese, bacon, steak, and tangy sauce that came with it made the steak utterly orgasmic. perfect blend of flavors. the meat practically melts in your mouth. friend got the steak in medium rare, but it seemed slightly more cooked than it should've been. it definitely didnt take away the tenderness though, this was the best steak i've had in my life (and i only took a couple of bites from it). this was one of the specials though, so it probably wont always be available. just writing about it right now is making my stomach grumble. i was craving to see what their desserts would taste like. we decided to go with the chocolate bread pudding ($10). it was really chocolate-y, but for chocolate-lovers like me, it was perfect. it was the cherry on top of an already great meal.", 
            "delmonico's is easily a 5-star restaurant, but not because there is a famous name (emeril lagasse) associated with the restaurant -- but because the food is simply exceptional. this is fine dining without the pretentiousness of stuffy, overpriced, mini-portion restaurants. \n\nwe happened to be staying at the venetian hotel & casino and made reservations to delmonico's, which is on the premises. there was about a 1-minute wait and we were quickly whisked away to a candlelit table. the restaurant itself is very simple yet elegant; nothing over the top, flashy or obnoxious. the lighting is perfect; not too dark and the wait staff is extremely attentive and prompt.\n\ndelmonico's is known for their steak; the bone-in rib eye steak. this slab of meat is prime and comes with a nice price tag. if you're at delmonico's -- ya might as well go for it, chump!\n\nfor starters, i had the <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> soup; thick, creamy and packed with flavor. i absolutely loved it! best <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> i have ever had. it came adorned with a polenta type cake in the middle. i am not sure if it was polenta or dried shrimp cake -  or even bread, but it didn't matter as it all happily made its way down my belly. \n\nwe also tried the crab meat cake; fresh chunks of crab atop a puff pastry and dressed with tomatoes, lima beans, asparagus and all sorts of good spring veggies. amazing! \n\ni decided to try the <mark>Colorado Rack of Lamb</mark> with the twice <mark>Baked Idaho Potato</mark>. jeff went with the rib eye steak and <mark>Baked Idaho Potato</mark>. the lamb was head-spinning! topped with a rich sauce and truffles! perfectly cooked and moist and tender and gaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhh! i can't rave enough. the steak was just as good -- even the fatty pieces were delicious. \n\nthe food, the service, the atmosphere, the attention to detail, the $25 corking fee -- all was worth the price. definitely a place to experience while out in sin city!",

            "as i have been to the emeril delmonico restaurant in new orleans and enjoyed it immensely, i decided to have dinner at the delmonico steakhouse located in the venetian resort hotel & casino where i was attending the phantom of the opera later that evening (incredible show by the way!).  what you'll find is a variety of food selections with creole influences. \n\nfirst the menu prices are expensive ($$$$) but you are there for the intimate and fine dining experience and should be expecting to pay those prices.  what i didn't expect was to be dressed up and have an individual in shorts, sandals, and a baltimore colts jersey seated at an adjacent table to me.  kind of lowered my view of this establishment being world class if you know what i mean.\n\ni started with the <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> which was just superb but did lack the \"creole\" twist i was expecting (the bam factor).  only thing that was a little of an inconvenience was the lobster pieces were quite large and were hard to cut with my spoon.  the wife selected the <mark>Organic Baby Mixed Greens Salad</mark> creole spiced croutons, sherry vinaigrette, shaved manchego cheese roasted teardrop tomatoes and shaved red onion.  i had a taste and it was very good.  the different flavors were unique and distinctive.\n\nthe main course i selected a pinot noir wine that to go along with my ribeye steak and selected the <mark>Roasted Fingerling Potatoes</mark> and whole garlic with fresh herbs.  the wine was fantastic with a rich and bold body and floral aroma.  wasn't dry and complimented the ribeye steak very well.  the ribeye has emeril's classic touch written all over it with the blackened spice rub with a pat of herb butter on top.  the cut was 1-1/2 inches thick, lean, and very large portion.  the potato dish was okay, didn't impress me in any way.  the wife also had the pinot noir and selected the <mark>Filet Mignon</mark>.  the cut had to be nearly 2 inches thick, lean, and a normal portion size.  i recommend selecting your ribeye to be cooked medium rare (i do not recommend medium) and your <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> medium rare or at the most medium.  \n\nsorry to say we were extremely full when we finished and couldn't partake of dessert.  the meal described above with tip was roughly $210.",

            "yummy!  i didn't realize this was an emeril (the \"bam!!!\" guy on the food network) restaurant until i looked at the menu.  cherylynn n. made reservations for a friend's 30th birthday dinner celebration.  our reservations were at 7pm, but part of our party got lost so we were seated around 7:15-7:30pm.  \n\nambiance:\nwell lit, but dim which created a \"romantic\" setting for those looking for a date night.  as we had 9 people in our party, we were set up in the middle in umm...an oddly shaped table (see cherylynn n's description).  the restaurant was packed, but the noise level wasn't too loud.\n\nservice:\ngreat service!  the waitress was very attentive.  when the food was brought out, there were 5 servers which each carried our entrees in each hand and simultaneously placed them in front of each of us at once.  it was truly a sight to see.\n\nfood:\n**note: most dishes are ala carte, so you'll probably want to order sides.  sides are big enough for 2-3 people to share**\n\n-crab bisque ($12) - delicious, creamy, and full of yummy flavor!!  this was on the chef's special list, therefore i am not sure if they have this on a regular basis.  the bisque soup is the same as the <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark>, but instead of lobster pieces, its generous portions of crab.\n\n-jumbo <mark>Roasted Maine Lobster Tail</mark> ($48/market price) - as i am not such a big meat eater, a <mark>Roasted Maine Lobster Tail</mark> was my alternative.  i didn't expect such a generous sized portion to come out.  it was heaven!!  delicious!!  tender!! \n\n-<mark>Delmonico Creamed Spinach</mark> side ($9) - it was good, but didn't have the additional pieces of bacon that most restaurants have.  you could definitely tell the spinach was fresh though.  \n\n-creamed corn side ($9) - yummmmmmm!!  i must come back especially for this side!! the corn was so sweet with a light crust on top.  words cannot describe how yummy this side was, definitely a must try!!\n\nso i know this is a steakhouse with steak, of course, being their specialty.  my friend insisted that i try some of his rib eye.  i'm not a meat person, but i will admit that it was tender and full of flavor.",

            "my husband took me here for our anniversary dinner. we arrived early at five because we had theatre tickets and had made dinner reservations accordingly.  the restaurant is beautiful with cream walls, rock wood and glass throughout with romantic lighting the evening was looking good. we ordered starters crab cakes for my husband nice crispy well seasoned crab i love a crab cake that is more crab then filler and this one was that. i ordered the steak tartar because i've never had it and wanted to be daring. i have to say i was scared lol but it was so worth it. wonderful crisp toasted baguettes with rich beef capers oil and seasoning and spicy mustard sauce  this has got to be one of the best dishes i've ever eaten and a must try. we then followed this with <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark>  rich warm and creamy with plenty of lobster one of my favorite lobsters bisques definitely.  i had the <mark>Petite Iceberg Lettuce Wedges</mark> a nice take on the classic salad with wisconsin blue cheese buttermilk dressing homemade apple wood bacon and just the right amount of red onion really tangy. for our entr\\u00e9e we had chosen to go with the  chateaubriand for two. they carve it tableside and serve it with asparagus and garlic potatoes the sides were actually very good but the meat was just ok nothing special and more red then i care for we had also ordered a side of saut\\u00e9ed garlic wild mushrooms which were also just ok i've had better versions of both these dishes. on to dessert we were bad and ordered two. the chocolate root beer float which was not that great i guess we just didn't care for the ginger and chocolate flavors together so we didn't finish this one but the banana cream pie was like biting into heaven little shavings of chocolate rich sweet whipped cream bananas and sweet rich caramel sauce make up this dish and it's worth every calorie that's probably packed into it. so splurge and have it it's amazing. the wait staff was amazing making sure you never wanted for anything and that everything went smoothly and the wine selection and service was top notch. definitely worth the splurge", 
            "** 100th review ** \n\ni had been anticipating this lunch for a few days. delmonico has been a favorite of mine but i hadn't dined there for a year. and, i was meeting esteemed london yelper yee gan o., who was on one of his dining and roller coaster trips across america. talking with yee gan was great. in fact, our conversation was so animated that our server asked if we wanted him to remain away, because we were discussing business. i told him that it wasn't business we were discussing, and he was thus welcome to hover over us. but, besides the consistency of the bearnaise sauce, the one complaint i have is that on this outing the waitstaff did not come close to hovering. i had to ask for a second roll, iced tea refills occurred but not too frequently, and an empty butter dish remained empty. this was in sharp contrast to my earlier visits to delmonico where i could barely get a glass down to half full before it was refilled, and when a new roll appeared as soon as an old one disappeared. the restaurant was not very crowded at all, so being too busy could not legitimately account for the laggard service. it wasn't so much our server but our assistant server who fell down on the job. he was responsible for refilling glasses, resupplying rolls, and making sure sufficient butter was available on the table. \n\nnow on to the meal itself! my <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> was very smooth, creamy, and flavorful, with a few morsels of sweet lobster to nibble on as garnish. it was all i hoped for! the <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> that followed was better than i expected. it was very tasty, with very fresh romaine lettuce leaves and long croutons that when broken spread cheesy garlic flavor all over the lettuce, to join with the parmesan splinters that were liberally spread over all. it was an excellent dish! \n\nmy <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> looked forlorn on the plate. only a large pat of maitre d' butter appeared beside it. a little pink blood was also pooled on the plate beneath the meat, which to me was a good sign. the prime grade filet was cooked almost all medium rare to order, but a few spots were closer to medium, and the steak was more peppery than i prefer. otherwise it tasted very good. it could have tasted even better had i not forgotten to order bearnaise sauce until the steak arrived at our table. that was my fault, and it probably contributed to the drama that followed. but the filet on my plate was not a $50 steak, which is what i paid for it. for that price--especially at lunch--i expect the filet to be great. this one was very good but not great. its size was not listed, but it was no more than 8 oz. \n\nour server immediately put in the order for bearnaise sauce, but it did not arrive for several minutes. he then made a point of telling me that the chef makes bearnaise sauce to order, and was preparing a new batch for me. a few minutes later, as i chipped away at more steak without any sauce, still no sauce had appeared. so i ate more of my steak, which was at least still tasty standing on its own. then the bearnaise sauce at last arrived, but it was runny and not very flavorful. it looked like it needed to set longer, so i left it alone for about two minutes, but the consistency remained thin after then. again, my tardiness in ordering the sauce probably caused the chef to rush its preparation, so i take partial responsibility for an imperfect bearnaise on this occasion. let this be a lesson to all diners: order bearnaise sauce when you order your steak--not when it arrives! \n\nas i ate my steak, i looked longingly at yee gan's lobster sliders, which looked delectable. but i'll let him report on that as well as the <mark>Traditional New Orleans Gumbo</mark> that he also ordered, which looked delicious as well, and that i have enjoyed before. but delmonico is first and foremost a steakhouse, and i wanted to review one of its steaks. (however, i may slip in again soon and order lobster sliders on my next lunch outing there.) \n\nmy side of <mark>Country Smashed Potatoes</mark> was a smash hit, with creamy red-skinned potatoes with a little of the skin showing, a few circles of green onion sprinkled on top, and including some very tasty lumps of potato that quickly dissolved in the mouth. i was going to take the remaining uneaten half of this quite large side dish home, it tasted so good--but forgot to do so, for which i am still kicking myself. for dessert, yee gan and i split a generous slice of emeril's renowned banana cream pie, which was top-heavy with whipped cream, filled with luscious pieces of banana, and also bedecked with chocolate shavings and caramel sauce. as i savored each bite, i tried to conjure up how to best describe the taste of this concoction, and one word stood out: \"heavenly.\" the only comparable banana cream pie i have eaten is the last one i had at delmonico. and, this one was better by a shaving. \n\noverall, a very good lunch with great company!", 
            "great atmosphere and service.  wonderful food (definitely try the <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark>). the filet was amazing as well.  a little pricey, but that is to be expected in vegas.", 
            "food was amazing. best <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> i ever had, perfectly cooked lobster. my husband had the ribeye, he's a true meat eater and is still raving about it. i had the <mark>Filet Mignon</mark>, incredible seasoning and cooked to perfection. ordered the creamed corn, delicious. \ndidn't give 5 stars....ambiance not in line with the high-priced menu. i've heard of minimalism, but it's bizarre to see art niches with nothing in them. noise level moderate. dress code needs to be enforced. arrived for a birthday dinner dressed to the 9's, watched a guy get seated @ a table near-by wearing camoflauge shorts and a polo shirt.\nfree sorbet for the b-day girl (seemed cheap)", 
            "i had the privilege of coming here in honor of two fo my friends' birthdays last month. being the type of guy who rarely eats at anywhere higher than a two $ sign establishment, i'd have to say this is by far the best dining experience i've ever had in my life, so far.\n\nour night started off with a very informative waiter showing us the ropes. it makes sense why these servers make the money they make, they are extremely good at their job and know the menu and wine pairings like the back of their hand. ..at least the server we had was of this caliber.\n\nfor starters, we had the truffle parmesean <mark>Truffle and Parmesan Potato Chips</mark>. these things are incredible. it's one of those dishes where you just want to savor each bite one chip at a time. so good.\n\nwe also tried the <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark>. best <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> i've ever had. very smooth, rich in lobster flavor, and not too overly salty. some fresh cracked pepper makes it just absolutely perfect.\n\nmy two friends went for the chateaubriand. an exquisite cut of tenderloin(same cut as <mark>Filet Mignon</mark>) so tender that it just nearly melts in your mouth.\n\ni had the bone in rib-eye. quite possibly the best steak i've ever had in my life. i ordered it medium rare. it was cooked perfectly, and once i had a taste, i just had to close my eyes and shut down all my other senses so that i can thorougly enjoy this. it was quite a big steak, but with the price i paid and the epic state of mind i was in, i finished it knowing that i couldn't leave all that buttery meaty goodness behind unfinished.\n\nthat on top of a bottle of wine and a few sides, our meal came out to be.. well.. expensive. but so worth it.", 
            "you know the expression about sailors having a woman in every port. well, on my recent trip to the usa, i had yelpers in every town to host, entertain and amuse!\n\nvegas elite dennis t was my lunch companion when i was in town. not only was he gracious enough to clear some time in his busy schedule to have lunch with me but i was honoured that he made our meal together his 100th review\n\ndennis gave me a list of tempting options for lunch. i had to watch how much i was going to have for lunch as i had a dinner reservation at raku that evening for the kaiseki menu but the lobster sliders at delmonico caught my eye, so that was my choice.\n\ni had a nice time wandering through the venetian on my way to delmonico. the size and scale of u.s. buildings in general amaze me but the venetian is certainly very ornate and i enjoyed looking at the menus while walking down restaurant row on the way to delmonico\n\ni instantly recognised dennis from his yelp picture and like all the yelpers i've met, conversation flowed like we were old friends. so much so that unusually for yelpers, we were chatting so much that ordering took awhile as we hadn't look at the menu the first few times that our waiter approached to take our order\n\nthe restaurant is certainly decked out to appeal to the higher end of customer. it was a quiet lunch service when we dined and while it provided a good ambiance for chatting, i perhaps didn't see delmonico as the busy celebrity chef steakhouse that it is.\n\ni had already decided on my main course of lobster sliders and using my personal rule of taking the opportunity of eating foods that i don't come across often, i paired that with an appetiser of <mark>Traditional New Orleans Gumbo</mark>. i'm not in any position to comment on the authenticity of the gumbo but as emeril lagasse started his celebrated celebrity chef trail with his first restaurant emeril's in new orleans, i'm guessing he can cook a good gumbo. mine was certainly pungent with a great depth of flavour from a carefully stock. being asian, i was also impressed to see that the rice had been cooked well\n\ndennis was pleased with his appetiser of <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> followed by <mark>Caesar Salad</mark>\n\nit may seem odd to eschew steak at a steakhouse. however, i've always liked the sound of lobster roll but still haven't tried one yet. i saw these lobster sliders as the nearest i could get until i make my trip to the northeast to try a real lobster roll. well, the sliders were excellent - soft rolls containing morsels of sweet lobster meat mixed with the right amount of mayonnaise and seafood dressing.\n\ndennis however wasn't quite as lucky with his fillet steak, which arrived looking rather lonely on the plate. dennis decided to order some bearnaise to correct this loneliness but it took a long time to appear and when it did, it seemed a bit watery.\n\nin an effort to not be too piggy, dennis and i split the banana cream pie. well, the combination of banana, pie, whipped cream, caramel and chocolate shavings pleased my palate probably more than my arteries! i don't have a really sweet tooth but i really enjoyed this\n\ndennis was kind enough to give a lift back to my hotel down the strip, which gave me a good touristy view of the sights\n\na friendship sealed. a celebrity chef ticked off. lobster sliders consumed. a most successful lunch rendezvous indeed!", 
            "given the big name attached to this place (emeril), and based on a friend's recommendation, i had high hopes. sadly, the name here is just a facade for mediocre food and service.\n\ni made reservations via yelp/opentable to treat my girl to a nice dinner on our first \"just us\" trip to las vegas.\n\nit was a cold night and she had decided to wear a heavy coat. when we arrived, neither the host or hostess offered to take her coat. i then asked them to take her coat and they responded that delmonico's doesn't offer a coat check. strike one.\n\nthe hostess seated us at a table that had obviously already been reserved for us, as two of the chairs at the four-person table had been removed. that was a small, but nice touch.\n\ni had expected delmonico's to have a dress code, but there were plenty of patrons in jeans and polo shirts. i almost want to strike the restaurant for that, but i understand it is vegas and they have to cater to a variety of customers. but it does take the ambiance down a notch.\n\nthe waiter appeared promptly and introduced himself (renee, i believe it was). i had to ask for the wine list. why should i have to *ask* for the wine list? strike two.\n\nrenee did not go over any of the specials with us. he also mentioned that two other servers would be assisting them, but he did so when they weren't there. so when one of them came by later, we had no idea which of the two assistants he was.\n\nthe assistant pretty much took over at that point, and we only saw renee once again (with the bill). the assistant asked to take our order before we even saw the wine list.\n\nthis wasn't turning out to be the pampered, high-quality service that i had come to expect based on my experiences at other fine dining establishments.\n\nour food came out fairly quickly; almost too quickly. we had barely received the wine when our appetizers arrived. she had the <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> which was very thin and only contained about 1oz of lobster. i had the duck prosciutto flatbread. the duck was overcooked and still had a layer of skin and fat that was rubbery.\n\nalmost instantly after we finished our appetizers, the main entrees arrived as if they had been waiting around the corner with the dishes to spring out as we took the last bites of our appetizers.\n\nshe ordered the filet and i had the bone-in rib-eye. both of the cuts were of good quality but were ruined by an over-seasoning of creole spices. both steaks were ordered medium rare and came out cooked perfectly.\n\nthe sides left much to be desired. many of the choices were bland and uninspiring. the broccoli was simply steamed with no seasoning or oils added. the <mark>Potato Gratin</mark> contained too much garlic.\n\nthe speed of the service and delivery of the meal was too fast. we finished dinner within 1 hour. strike three.\n\ntotal damage, including wine ($120 for the bottle) and tip, came to ~$340. we've had much, much better fine dining experiences (and food) for less.\n\ni would not recommend this place to anyone looking for a classy, upscale meal. it's just a touristy, over-priced restaurant with a celebrity chef's name tied to it.\n\nthere are many better options available in vegas.",

            "this is my favorite restaurant in the united states, bar none.\n\nsome of the best service and atmosphere i've ever seen in a restaurant, anywhere. for example....\n\na few days before one visit, i called to request that the peanut butter cream pie, a dessert special from a past trip, be once again on the desert menu. when we showed up for dinner, we didn't see the pie on the menu, but were informed that the chef had made and saved an entire pie just for our party. it was unbelievable.\n\nand oh the food....\n\n** warning: this meal is a marathon. if you're not a big eater, don't be afraid to share appetizers, order smaller steaks, skip the rolls, etc so that you can room for all parts of this amazing, amazing meal.\n\n**** appetizers ****\n-- <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> is the clear ungodly standout.\n-- all the salads are routinely excellent.\n-- skip the <mark><mark>Ahi Tuna</mark> and Salmon Tartare</mark> and <mark>Heirloom Tomato Soup</mark> -- they aren't as impressive.\n-- the free rolls are really, really excellent.\n\n**** wine ****\n-- for those that (like me) enjoy wine but aren't connoisseurs, the fisticuffs cabernet is my go-to. it goes great with all steaks at a reasonable ($55) price.\n\n**** steak ****\n-- ribeye is the obvious play, and is amazing (and huge), but the filet is outstanding for those who want something smaller and not quite as rich.\n-- try <mark>Au Poivre Style</mark> for really powerful flavor. steak purists should do the ribeye straight up, but those who like peppery and lightly sweet flavors would love the filet au poivre.\n-- i am told that they serve entrees besides steak, but i have never, ever seen anyone be so misguided as to come here and fail to order a steak.\n\n**** sides ****\n-- usually we have one person order all the sides for the group, just to make sure we get a good mix of them so everyone can try everything. they're served family-style, and are big enough for ~3 people to have some.\n-- twice <mark>Baked Idaho Potato</mark> (which has gratuitous amounts of cheese and bacon) is incredible, albeit heavy. two can share, but my friends insist on ordering their own.\n-- mushrooms are some of the best i've had, and go perfectly with the steak.\n-- broccoli or asparagus is a good choice to contrast the rich steak.\n\n**** desserts ****\n-- oatmeal pecan pie is one of my favorite desserts anywhere. you will want a whole one yourself after one bite, so order accordingly.\n-- banana cream pie is well known and hyped, for good reason. it is also enormous.\n-- skip the bread pudding and peach cobblers -- they're good but not in the same league.", 
            "we came here for our one year anniversary dinner.   i was a little intimidated to eat at a place like this in vegas but once we were seated everyone was super nice and didn't make us feel like we shouldn't be there.   \n\nthe menu has a bunch of different things on it but the star of the show (as told by my waitress) is the beef.   husband and i knew we were both going to order steak before we even looked at the menu.   \n\ni ordered the ribeye with <mark>Country Smashed Potatoes</mark> and husband got the <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> with creamed corn.   the side were served family style and were more than enough for two people.   the creamed corn was fantastic.  it had little bits of jalapeno in it for the extra bam!  \n\nwe both ordered the <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> to start.   bisque was very delicious especially the lumps of lobster meat.   did you know during the summer the bisque is dairy free?  \n\nthe steaks were just okay.  asked for mine medium but it came out well done so i didn't find it that good.  husband also asked for medium but basically got a rare steak.   \n\noverall though the atmosphere was definitely upscale yet comfortable.  i want to compliment our waitress ...she was very friendly and fun.   check was $164 dollars for two people.", 
            "steakhouses in vegas are like starbucks in the usa... they're everywhere. if you're passing by a nice restaurant in a hotel casino, there's a good chance that it's a steakhouse. maybe vegas has figured out that eating an expensive steak will make you feel better despite the fact that you just lost hundreds of dollars...\n\nsome friends and i had lunch at delmonico's this past weekend and we got there right when it opened for lunch. we were their first customers and spent most of our lunch being the only people in the restaurant. therefore, i guess it's no surprise why we got such great service. we made small talk with our servers and they were very pleasant and attentive throughout our entire meal.\n\none friend who has been here before was raving about their <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> and banana creme pie. i got to try their <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> ($16) and thought it was good but i'm no connoisseur of bisque.  the bisque comes with scrumptious pieces of lobster and it was very rich and creamy. i ordered the filet of beef medallions ($21) and they were super tender. although they were covered in bread crumbs and a mushroom type sauce, the medallions were quite delicious. the entree isn't very big and i was still hungry afterwards so i suggest getting this alongside an appetizer. i got a bite of the banana creme pie and not only did it look amazing, the taste of it was delightful. \n\ndelmonico's is a surprisingly huge restaurant. i hope their dinner draws in a larger crowd that it does for lunch or else much of their space could be put to better use. the lunch menu is rather limited but it's priced right with the most expensive entree being only $21. all in all, pretty good food and extremely good service. you gotta try that banana creme pie!",

            "the food here is pretty good but the reason i'm giving 3 stars is because i personally don't think it's any better than a ruth's chris, which is half the cost.\n\nwhat stood out the most was the <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark>. it was really good! but everything else wasn't better what i could have gotten at ruth's chris, especially not the banana cream pie which was worse.\n\nmy advice, save your money and go to ruth's chris or another restaurant.",

            "as vegas steakhouses go, delmonico is a fine choice. i've been there twice and both times i've had very good meals. with that said, meeting expectations at this high price point is challenging, and particularly on my most recent visit i'm afraid delmonico should have been even better. this year we had a large company dinner at delmonico, so i was able to try lots of dishes. \n\nwe started with the bbq shrimp and the <mark>Butternut Squash Ravioli</mark>. the shrimp was good but a little overcooked. the squash was on the rich side but really tasty - you couldn't have but so many so it is good that they list it as an appetizer rather than as a pasta main. i loved one or two but a plateful would've been too much.  i also tried the <mark>Truffle and Parmesan Potato Chips</mark>, which were wonderful but extremely truffley. \n\nthe <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> was textbook, exactly what <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> is supposed to be - rich and creamy with chunks of tender lobster meat. still i might have preferred my neighbor's <mark>Vine-Ripened Heirloom Tomato Salad</mark>, which i tried and thought was one of the highlights of the meal.  i didn't try it but the duck from the smoked duck salad was not well received by another of my colleagues. \n\nfor my entr\\u00e9e i had the delmonico signature steak - a <mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark>. this is where the meal fell down ever so slightly. the steak was fine but for the premium price it should have been exceptional and it definitely wasn't. my order of medium rare was barely pink at all and was probably served on the dark side of medium, and i thought the meat was surprisingly devoid of flavor. don't get me wrong - it was a fine steak, but it was average among the steaks i've had in las vegas, at all price points. one of my close work friends who has frequented delmonico for years ordered the same cut at the dinner and he agreed that for his steak too it was an off-night. of the sides i loved the creamed corn. next time i'd do the mashed potatoes over the scalloped potatoes, which i found undercooked and under seasoned. the asparagus was also fine but unspectacular. \n\nthe bread pudding was great and the key lime pie (or was it cheesecake?) was nice too, but i'll reserve my sweetest accolades for the banana cream pie. best bite of the night. one of the best i've had. wonderful.",

            "we went to delmonico's in the palazzo/venetian for a pre-theater dinner.  while nothing was bad, it wasn't a four or five star experience, either.  the service was competent, and the restaurant decor is definitely upscale.  \n\nthis is an emeril restaurant, so they have some cajun/creole items on the menu along with steak and seafood.  i started with the <mark><mark>Ahi Tuna</mark> and Salmon Tartare</mark>.  a nice starter served with a small cucumber salad, but nothing extraordinary.  the <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> arrived after sitting on the pass for awhile, it seemed, as there was already a skin atop the soup.  it was a nice bisque, about what you'd expect at a steakhouse.  the petite iceberg wedge salad was, again, pretty standard with bacon and blue cheese.  i finished with the halibut served over what they call vegetable risotto.  it was good; maybe a bit overcooked, but i enjoyed it.  \n\nthe rest of the table ordered appetizers and steaks, and while they said the steaks were good...no fireworks to speak of.  i did try a bit of my gf's ribeye, and was actually a bit surprised that it was lacking flavor in my opinion.  the ribeye is usually very flavorful, but this almost tasted like a filet; tender, but without any real steak pop and just a hint of gaminess.  \n\noverall, especially for the price, i thought the food would have been a bit more inspired, but as it ended up it was just ok.  not a place i'd steer anyone away from, since the menu is diverse and the wine list very respectable, but if you're looking for something really special, i don't think this really hits the mark.  there are certainly better steak and seafood restaurants in vegas that are less, at, or a bit more than this price point that would be much better.  \n\ninterestingly enough, despite the restaurant's name...they had no delmonico steak on the menu.  i thought that was a bit odd, as well.  :)", 
            "my family went here for fathers day at noon. the place had a very nice atmosphere. we sat two minutes after checking in.  five minutes later, a waiter approached us and took our order for drinks. he introduced himself and another waitress. we got our drinks and ten to fifteen minutes later, a different waitress gave us bread.  a person in a suit then approached us to ask if we were ready to order. we replied, \"yes\".  he then walked away instead of taking our order. i would assume that he is the manager.  a different waitress then approached us to finally take our order.  this took more than half an hour from the time we sat down.  sad thing was that the table behind us sat after we did and was already eating their appetizer before someone took our order.  mind you, we sat before several customers and they were attended to first. very very poor start of customer service.  i would think that this place would have excellent service consistently.  another, i had black slacks on. i placed the napkin on my lap, and behold the napkin left tons of white lint on my black pants.  i went to other restaurants in vegas and i was offered a black napkin to use instead.  others, the napkin did not leave as much lint as this one did. i ordered the <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark>, which was excellent. creamy, smooth, and a lot of flavor.  i also ordered the filet medallions.  it had panko breading which i really didn't care for.  the bacon was charred and hard, but the two filet medallions were great.  it also had a simple sauce with small mushrooms. my dad had the lobster sliders.  the sliders were surprisingly great according to my dad.  they didn't skimp on the lobster.  instead of shredded pieces, they are a generous portion in the sliders.  the bread they offered got cold pretty quick but it was still good to eat.  at first, drinks were coming in slow. then the waiters paid more attention to us in the end.  the restroom was located all the way in the very back.  i thought i had to exit the building itself to use the restroom.  you have to through a very long hallway to the very back towards the exit sign.  the sink was shallow and i could barely wash my hands in it since it's so shallow that my hands will get wet from the dirty water in the sink.  there was only one sink available.  food would have been excellent.  service was mediocre.  i'm not sure i would return here if i have this kind of service.  it was my first time here.", 
            "fantastic experience. went here with a group of 9 and we all enjoyed ourselves. the service was exceptional; the <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> was generous with the portions of lobster; and the bone in strip steak was good (although not the best i've had.) a friend had the salmon and said it was in his top 5 restaurants ever.  for sides we had broccoli and mash for the table..both were good. i'd definitely go back.", 
            "i would give delmonico a 2.5 or even more if it was available but as it's 2 or 3 unfortunately for them i have to go with 2. there were so many pluses for the meal that i feel bad about rating the restaurant low. however, the overall experience was not what i wanted, and for a  meal of this price i have pretty achievable expectations.\n\nfor starters, the sevice was immaculate and i mean truly immaculate, the servers work as a team and they we're amazing. from recommending wines to full descriptions of food, and even drinks, they were aces. the wine list had so many rare and amazing finds that you could get lost searching, thankfully the staff was able to help us pick out one perfect for our tastes and meal. for the appetizer, bone in bacon, we'll if you didn't think it would be absolutely amazing by the name i can promise you, words do not describe how amazing this appetizer is. it truly is memorizing. try it, and you'll understand. \n\nfor dinner i had a filet and he had a bone in ribeye, their signature cut. unfortunately  my husband had to send his steak back due to being substantially overlooked. again, the waitstaff immediately addressed the issue and apologized agreeing with my husband that not only was the steak overlooked, but it was substantially overlooked, ie, the steak was ordered medium rare and came out between medium well and well.\n\nthe waitstaff removed the steak from the table and after a few minutes brought my husband a second steak, most notable on the second steak was the fact that the steak butter was not melted, leading us to believe that the  steak was brought directly from the grill to the table, no time to rest under a lamp and overcook itself, a plus we thought. until my husband cut into the second ribeye, again their signature steak, again substantially overlooked. at this point the server, who was speaking with my husband about the meal and appologizing about the previous steak appeared appalled that again, the steak was substantially overdone. he appeared embarrassed for the issues. we were promised no matter what it would be made up for and even the manager immediately addressed my husband and appeared completely appalled that the steak was so overdone, for a second time, (this time closer to medium well, maybe a high medium, but still nowhere near medium rare.) \n\nthe manager and server traded apologies and promised to make things right. due to the fact that i had only had half of my filet, my husband opted to not receive another ribeye, instead choosing to just finish my meal. the server and manager happily took the ribeye off and purchased us two desserts for the troubles and issues. \n\nfor the good, the menu is amazing. in it's entirety, i believe it rivals some of the best steakhouses around. the <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> is by far the best i've had, and as a fan of <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark>, i've had it at several 4 and 5 star restaurants all over the united states. presentation, flavor, texture, everything was amazing. \n\nthe bone in bacon, if i didn't convince you before, it is one of the most flavorful dishes i have ever had, the watermelon is a little strange sounding but brings out so much flavor that again, i just can't put it into words, you have to experience this dish!\n\nmy filet oscar was great, perfectly cooked, very flavorful and perfectly seasoned. i just wish i had a second stomach to finish it after almost licking the plate of <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> and bone in bacon. \n\ndesserts were great as everything else, and the after dinner drink list is as expansive as the wine list. if you can imagine it, they have it. \n\nmy only issue is my husbands meal, again i feel bad because i understand mistakes happen, but it was very unfortuonate that for a dinner to celebrate our first annivarsary, at the end he/we were disappointed. he continued to describe it as \"the food was amazing, but not what i was hoping for.\" \n\ni personally have issues with a $300 meal (granted $130 of it being an amazing and perfectly reccomended bottle of wine,) being disappointing in any way. again mistakes happen and i believe firmly that they are rare at delmonicos, but i cannot change this disappointing experience. \n\nif this is the only negative review that you read please do not discount this restaurant. again, mistakes happen, and even as i write this, i feel bad for not giving the restaurant better ratings because so many things were good and accidents happen, but it doesn't change the experience tonight. hopefully, as it appeared, this will be a rare experience and we may give this restaurant another shot the next time we're in vegas, but as this was supposed to be a special meal celebrating, i will say disappointing is the best way to describe it. the restaurant has so much more potential and obviously could have done so much better than we experienced, we were just unlucky. again, no fault on the waitstaff, they were amazing, but overall experience was disappointing. i hope others have better luck than we did.", 
            "i would recommend this to anyone that's in vegas and wants a good steak. the bone in ribeye was certainly amazing, along with appetizers. and i think the price is very reasonable. \n\nif i have to complain about anything is that i didn't like the <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> cuz it was drenched in dressing. but everything else was super yummy. \n\nhere is what we ordered:\ntuna and salmon tartar: omg so good. combined with the crispy chips, i could order two of it for an entry next time. \n\nfresh oysters: tasted very fresh\n\nbbq shrimp: got it despite yelp reviews say not to. thought it was pretty good. nice bbq sauce. \n\n<mark>Lobster Bisque</mark>: good but too salty. tasted better with bread. there were big chunks of lobsters though. \n\n<mark>Caesar Salad</mark>: it was made table side. nothing spectacular, and way too much dressing. \n\nbone in rib eye: amazing\n\n<mark>Bone-In New York Strip</mark>: pretty good but wasn't as good as the rib eye. \n\nsalmon: forgot the exact name but it was very good. it had like gumbo style things on the bottom which made it interesting. \n\ngarlic mushroom side: good \n\ngarlic mash potatoes: just goes so well with the rib eye.", 
            "after a quick drink at public house, i was feeling pretty good, and hungry, and a little buzzed. here's how my conversation with our waiter began:\n\nme: \"what kind of bread is this?\"\nwaiter: \"they're popovers sir.\"\nme: \"has anyone ever commented that they're shaped like dicks?\" \nwaiter: \"haha, no sir, very good observation sir.\" \n\nyup, their popovers were pretty much shaped like dicks. they were a bit cold, oily, and combined with the refrigerated butter (one of my pet peeves at restaurants), a big disappointment. despite the phallic start to dinner, the rest of the meal and service was excellent. \n\nthe recommended <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> was a great way to cleanse my palate of that bread. there were big chunks of lobster meat and the bisque was well-seasoned without going overboard with the salt. delmonico is known for their <mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark> so i ordered that medium-rare. the steak was more on the medium side, but no complaints here as it was just as juicy and tender. no steak is complete without a side of <mark>Delmonico Creamed Spinach</mark>, which was done well. all sides are portioned to be shared. despite a misstep with my friend's order (bone-in ny strip instead of boneless), service was spot on.", 
            "great experience. we had a couple of friends in town and this place came highly recommended. the cherry martini is so good! i could eat a bowl of the liquor soaked cherries they put in it! we had the bbq shrimp, <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark>, and the bacon for appetizers! we ate those too quickly to get pics! the guys got rib eyes. ladies got fillet both were stellar! the ribeye had more flavor! the sides we got we're all great. asparagus, twice <mark>Baked Idaho Potato</mark>, creamed corn, and <mark>Potato Gratin</mark>. for dessert, banana cream pie and pineapple upside down cake. our bill before tip was over $400 but well worth every penny!", 
            "this was the steakhouse we decided to grub after my half marathon on the strip. i was concerned that my race attire didn't suit the ambiance and when we entered, we were welcomed. cool! \n\nthe staff was outstanding and very informative of the menu. we were led to a private corner booth which made our dinner even more special. we were offered menus and an ipad for our wine selections. i ordered a champagne to celebrate my last race of the year, and the fiancee ordered a glass of justin cab (one of his faves).\n\n-we were offered comped bread (popover) and butter. love the soft butter!!! \n-<mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> to share ($16)\n-<mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark> ($55)\n-bone-in ny strip ($50)\n-twice <mark>Baked Idaho Potato</mark> ($9)\n-duck egg creme br\\u00fbl\\u00e9e ($11)\n\nsteaks had a great rub on it and was topped with butter. yup butter... because i had the rib-eye, there was a lot of fat! yum!!! i was only able to eat half my steak since it was so huge!!! the fiancee finished his ny. the potato was average and came with all the fixings on the side. i just wanted extra butter. dinner was great.\n\nthe dessert was a bit disappointing. we ordered the duck egg creme br\\u00fbl\\u00e9e since it was unique and highly recommended. at first the dessert was good, but after eating a couple more bites, the dessert started tasting a bit funny. it was so rich and i think the weird taste was getting to our tastebuds! too bad there wasn't a molten lava cake!\n\nservice and ambiance was superb. love walking through the palazzo to get this restaurant! beautiful!!!", 
            "so this review is going to be two sided since we had mixed experiences. let me start out by saying this is my 3rd emeril's restaurant in vegas. the other two places fish house and table 10 are always on the half priced ticket booth so a discount is always possible but given this is a steakhouse in the venetian no discount. we came here on dec 30th before our marroon 5 concert. securing a reservation over the phone a few days ahead of time was easy. we had wine, appetizers,2 main entrees,2 side dishes and a dessert. \nthe service and customer service here is exceptional. \n\nwe tried the <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark>, pasta special appetizer, bbq shrimp, cajun ribeye, <mark>Filet Mignon</mark>, gratin potatoes, mushrooms and the choc cake. \nmost of the food was delicious but a few fell short like the ribeye and choc cake. the ribeye was overcooked, not that tender and lacking seasoning. the choc cake was dry and previously frozen. the special pasta appetizer was good but not excellent or anything i would mention ordering again. \nthe filet was delicious and the demi glaze sauce was the highlight. the bbq shimp were delicious along with the little biscuit that comes with it. the <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> was creamy and seasoned well. my server let me try a sample before deciding on a main appetizer. \n\nwhen asked about our dining experience- we were completely honest with the manager and our server. the main issue was how long we waited for our meal and the $55 ribeye didn't live up to his name. they also forgot to put in one of our appetizers. however, this place gets a four instead of a three because of the amazing customer service we received as a guest. they expedited our food and when we received the bill the ribeye, 2 appetizers, and the cake was taken off our entire bill which to me speaks volumes about how great their customer relations and service is. they have a name to live up to . we had a mixed dining experience but i would probably come back and give this place another chance due to the outstanding customer service. keep up the good work.", 
            "this absolutely by far is my favorite steakhouse in las vegas. i went here again on my 29th birthday, and the service was amazing as always. i ordered the ribeye to share along with the best <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> you will ever have. also the <mark>Truffle and Parmesan Potato Chips</mark> are to die for. the restaurant is very classy and a bit pricey, however, you get what you pay for. i've tried pretty much all of the restaurants at the venetian, and i have to stay this one is my absolute favorite. the steaks come out a perfect medium rare cooked to perfection in butter.\n\nsince this is a popular restaurant, i highly recommend making a reservation in advance. it's a nice restaurant to take a date as well as to celebrate a special occasion.", 
            "this place is first class in every way. <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> is second to none. awesome service! going back in march!!", 
            "first off, to make the most of your experience, you should know what to expect from delmonico service by doing your yelp homework. this place doesn't get a full 5 stars because of the service. \n\nit's been a while since i've felt so insulted by a server. i don't even know his name since he didn't introduce himself, so i know him as the big guy with a beard. he was unfriendly and wrote us off immediately when the table next to us wanted to share half of their <mark>Seafood Tower</mark> with us (it's massive and delicious by the way... thank you amazing strangers from new mexico!).\n\nwe were celebrating an anniversary and greeted warmly by the host stand, but while other yelpers say that their servers brought them a scoop of sorbet to celebrate, we got nothing. so hold your server accountable to giving you the experience you deserve for the price tag you pay. he would have gotten 30% if he wasn't such a douche.\n\nonto the food!\n- <mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark>: duh, do as all 1100 yelp reviews say and get this! fantastic marbling with an amazing crust. and yes... share a steak and order some other stuff! \n\n- <mark>Roasted Fingerling Potatoes</mark>- a light hint of rosemary and more potatoes than a patch on a farm. really tasty and beautiful. sides all seem easily shareable for four people.\n\n- <mark>Delmonico Creamed Spinach</mark>- not too heavy on seasoning, but perfectly delicious and enjoyable. perfect with the ribeye.\n\n- <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark>- if you get this, i would highly recommend sharing. it's too rich and heavy to eat a whole bowl.\n\n- penis-shaped pop-overs (as another yelp reviewer notes)- try a bite, but save room for appetizers!\n\nat the end of the day, i would certainly come back for the food. you will end up ordering too much because everything sounds delicious; next time we'll be trying bbq shrimp and truffled <mark>Truffle and Parmesan Potato Chips</mark> too!", 
            "i'll start this review off for you skimmers out there that don't read long reviews. the bone-in rib-eye is the greatest steak experience you will ever have, hands down. just eat it. go. do it.\n\nnow for you that are still with me, here's my full-on, cash money, baller review...for what it's worth:\n\ndelmonico must have a good database manager behind the scenes, because it had been a long time since my last dinner there (prob 5-6 years), yet they immediately greeted me and remembered my patronage (2 visits prior).  what a great feeling (and rather impressive to my gf) that the host and hostess and wait-staff greet you like you're a goddamn king touring the countryside. \n\nthis trip to las vegas was during a getaway weekend and to see long time friends, but we had a little dinner the night before some festivities for just us. i wanted to visit delmonico again, because i had remembered such a positive experience with food and service the times before.\n\nso we are greeted by the sommelier and our lead waiter, who throw out a few drinks and possible pairings, review the specials, roll over some changes in the menu (all from memory mind you). we knew we were eating steaks and heartier dishes, so we opted for a bottle of a good sonoma cab sauv we recognized.  \n\nthe chef paid his compliments with an amuse bouche' of a olive oiled crustini with duck fat and a mushroom.  it was a delicious little oily, fatty, salty bite that told the taste buds \"hey bitches...i'm comin' for you...get ready!\"\n\nwe were treated to some hot brioche popovers and full-fat butter, and i had to oblige at least one...cannot say no...(it's completely un-american to pass up on such things).\n\nwe decided to start the evening by sharing an heirloom tomato and burrata cheese salad (faux caprese), and a table-side <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark>. the salad was graciously split onto two plates for us, and was perfectly portioned with greens, veg, cheese, and a light dressing (that was not overpowering). the bisque was poured at our table with huge chunks of lobster, and a smooth velvet-like texture. flavors were perfect and the temp was outstanding. i had mine and finished my gf's (she always worries about getting to full before the main meal comes).\n\ni had ordered the bone-in rib-eye au poivre and my lady chose the filet medallions. i must impress upon you again that the bone-in rib-eye is the way to go. it is perfectly broiled at high temp, with amazing peppercorn seasoning and having it with the mushrooms sauce and onions is the bomb-sauce. there is nothing like it. it is a huge cut of meat, with great crusting outside, perfect marbling, and the bone-in flavor. the hot-reddish/pink medium to medium-rare center makes for a tender, juicy, and magnificent steak.  i honestly didn't even partake of her medallions much, because i didn't need to, and wouldn't cheat on my rib-eye.  i let the lady try some of mine and she immediately agreed its the best steak, anywhere, ever. we had a side of asparagus as well, which i felt very bad for because i gave it very little love. i hate leaving soldiers on the battlefield but i wanted to win the war with that steak and had a long night ahead of me of shows and clubs and didn't want terrible meat sweats...so i had to be courteous of tummy room.\n\nnow that we've effectively covered food, let me give a swag at the service. top notch. all the way around. polite, informed, friendly, attentive enough without being intrusive. well-trained veteran folks throughout...no schmucks looking to hump tables as a side gig, these are true to form, real career servers who take pride in their appearance, their posture, plating, timing, knowledge, and truly love their career...these folks work years before graduating to a place like delmonico or craftsteak, etc. these guys get huge tips and get to work with fine chefs in multi-million dollar restaurants...they're the cream of the wait staff crop.\n\ntotal wine, apps, dinner (no dessert, saved room for later on) was what i expected at ~$300. well worth it to treat ourselves and enjoy a top-notch meal.  \n\nlook folks, even if you're not an emeril fan (yes he owns the delmonico name), you can still love this place. a) he's no longer the executive chef of either location, b) the experience is always good here and the place stands alone on its merits, and c) that damned rib-eye is scheduled for my last meal on planet earth (someday). \n\ntrust me folks...when in vegas...eat like a damned king. treat yourself to amazing service, amazing food, and good times...enjoy!!", 
            "this time, for dinner, emeril's employees took it up a notch, and diane and i enjoyed a five-star dining experience here.  we were initially served an amuse bouche of bruschetta, tomato, mozzarella, & balsamic followed by an ordered starter of <mark>Emeril's New Orleans Barbecue Shrimp</mark> that came with a light petite rosemary buttermilk biscuit and strong, heavy bbq sauce.\n\nwhile diane enjoyed a bowl of <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> with maine lobster garnish, i savored the vibrant contrasting flavors of <mark>Traditional New Orleans Gumbo</mark> with shrimp & andouille sausage.  then it was time for our mains.\n\nwhile diane worked on a petite filet without char, i applied myself to a 9-ounce lightly charred <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> cooked perfectly medium rare as ordered, with a large pat of maitre d' butter melting slowly over the top.  both steaks came with classic yorkshire pudding, which tasted best after being rubbed in meat juices that ran slightly on the plate.  the meat melted in the mouth, aided by dipping in either a quite tasty homemade worcestershire sauce or drinkable b\\u00e9arnaise sauce.  i also topped my towering rectangle of beef with a side of sauteed garlic wild mushrooms, which included multiple varieties.  we also shared a large side of very cheesy and crusty <mark>Potato Gratin</mark>.\n\nfor dessert, for us there was no choice.  it was foreordained.  no one makes banana cream pie better than emeril lagasse!  one slice of emeril's banana cream pie was easily enough for both me and my spouse to share.  together we delighted in this rich confection of ripe banana chunks set in layers like a brick wall with sweet cement, and adorned with chocolate shavings, whipped cream, and caramel sauce.  mellow decaffeinated arabica coffee served in a french press just further enhanced the end of this fine meal.  seating was very comfortable in a half-booth, and service was both professional and knowledgeable. \n\nwe will surely return for more of the same!", 
            "had dinner at delmonico a few days ago and a few things surprised me. i felt like i was sitting in a ball room rather than a restaurant and although we ordered a bottle of white wine and a bottle of red wine, both bottles were opened in front of us without offering us to taste before pouring the glasses.  <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> was amazing.   actual dinners were ok.", 
            "we expected much better. the design of this restaurant is great, the service is great but the steaks are not great. they started us with a complimentary thin slice of cucumber topped with tiny lentils, a tasty tidbit. we then had the <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> which was very good with large chunks of lobster in it. my husband had the bone- in ny strip,medium rare, it was grizzly and very chewy, not worth a price tag of $50. i had the petite piedmontese <mark>Filet Mignon</mark>, 6oz., although extremely small for $50.00 it was very good. we were then given a small scoop of complimentary blood orange sorbet and finished the meal with the pecan pie, good but not memorable. with all the steakhouses in vegas we have no reason to return here.", 
            "before i went to this place, i checked some reviews which were mostly positive. first, staff was very courteous and decor was simple and inviting. one thing i noticed was there were way too many employees waking and standing around and it was very distracting at times. as for the food, other than the bone in ribeye steak which was decent considering the portion and the price, everything else was a real disappointment. i got better <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> at lobster me next door for $4, i mean a lot better. their soup was awful.\ni really wanted to like this place considering it was our wedding anniversary but it was a real letdown.", 
            "we ate dinner for our anniversary and lunch on our final day. food was so tasty and my hubby is still raving about the bone-in steak, the salmon was moist and succulent. jumbo prawn cocktail, <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark>, lobster sliders, specialty drinks tale of two cherries <mark>Half Dozen Raw Oysters on the Half Shell</mark>... i can go on and on rene, lamont and dominique were top notch service experts!!  #vegasfinedining #betterthandelicious", 
            "husband suggested that we come back here for lunch today. they started us off with two bread poppers each which were not bad. i ordered a <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> soup as starter which was insanely delicious. probably one of the better <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> i've ever tasted.  it has big chunks of lobster meat in the soup.  although the first sip of the soup seemed a little salty, the flavor is very good, strong and savory. it is one of my favorite dishes here. \n\nmy husband ordered the <mark>Beef Carpaccio</mark> arugula salad because the salad we normally order from here is no longer on the menu. we were not sure what to order but after we tasted the salad we loved it. it is a very large salad which almost felt like a meal and it has a very clean balanced savory taste.  my husband says that this was one of his favorite salads; me on the other hand i still like the old salad i used to older here.  maybe i'm just more old-school and like my salad plain with arugula, spinach, tomatoes and good cheese. \n\nwe ordered two entr\\u00e9es. one was the salmon entr\\u00e9e which was insanely divine. it is served with a big piece of salmon fillet with grilled sweet corn and crab pieces which complimented the salmon impeccably. both my husband and i love this dish and we both indicated that we will be ordering this again in the future when we come back here. in fact we may each order one of this salmon dish. that is how much we love this dish. it is very delicious. any salmon lover should definitely give the salmon dish a try.\n\nthe other entr\\u00e9e that we ordered was the lobster sliders. i did not know that this was a cold sandwich dish. i personally do not like cold sandwiches and also i only like my lobster done the traditional way so that you can taste the natural fresh sweet flavors of a good lobster. the lobster sliders had some kind of seasoning/dressing to it. although they did not skimp on the lobster meat and they do give you a lot of big chunks of lobster meat with the sliders, the taste was not to my personal liking. i think i will stick with the salmon entr\\u00e9e and my <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> in the future.\n\ncome check out this place when you're in town. you will not be disappointed.", 
            "what a wonderful food experience!!  our waiter ryan was perfect and treated us well. give the <mark>Truffle and Parmesan Potato Chips</mark> a try, you will love them. <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> was good as was our steaks.  side dishes are large so split the order.  the decor is lovely and it was a nice quiet atmosphere. wish we had room for dessert but maybe next time.  there's definitely lots of places to eat in vegas but i have to say come to delmonico steakhouse. it's well worth every penny.", 
            "this was an amazing meal with wonderful service.  we ordered <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> and it was the best steak we ever had and we are from the midwest.  emeril knows his steak!  husband started with the <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark>.  best bisque we have ever had.  gratin potatoes were wonderful as an accompaniment for the steak!  last we had the emeril's banana cream pie.  omg!!!  this meal was worth every penny we spent on it.  it was incredible.  delmonico's is a must do in las vegas!", 
            "aweful <mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark>. average/bland/dry au-gratin potatoes. good <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark>.\nboth mine and my husband's rib-eyes were gristly and fatty (neither had marbling that is found in good cuts of meat). about 25% to 30% of our steaks were gristle and fat, which we left on our plates. we both thought the seasoning was boring, but we know that's a matter of preference. \nwe eat at nice steakhouses (del frisco's, ruth's chris, brook's, morton's, elway's, shannahan's) a couple of times a year, so we think we know about quality steak. our steak and au-gratin potatoes were something a casual dining restaurant like chili's or applebee's would serve.\nstaff was pleasant.\nour demogs: mid-40's, professionally employed, live in colorado.", 
            "my wife & i dined here while we were in vegas for a conference. with so many places to choose from we decided on delmonico because it was in our hotel & we figured we couldn't go wrong at one of emeril's restaurants. the dining area was very spacious & well decorated. the staff was very friendly and attentive to all our needs. i started with the wedge salad which was excellent. the bacon had a great smokey flavor & was crispy. the blue cheese was some of the best i ever had. my wife had the <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> which was excellent as well. we the decided to try the chateaubriand dinner for 2 which came with garlic mashed potatoes & asparagus. the meal is brought out and the meat is served table side. we ordered it medium rare & it was perfect for me. it had excellent flavor and was extremely tender. my wife would have preferred it to be a little more cooked in the center but she ate the outer pieces which for a little more well down but still tender & tasty. the potatoes & asparagus were both  perfectly cooked with great flavor. we passed on dessert because we were too full to eat anything else. i would highly recommend this restaurant & would eat there again when in vegas!", 
            "everything about this place was amazing.  the food, the service, the ambiance, it couldn't have been better.  we began our meal with bbq shrimp, <mark>Apple Cured Kurobuta Bone-In Bacon</mark>, and <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark>, all of which were delicious.  now on to the steaks. we ordered <mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark> and this was by far the best steak i've ever had. it was perfectly prepared and the flavor was out of this world. for our sides we ordered saut\\u00e9ed mushrooms and grits, both of which were equally delicious.  we finished our meal with dessert and we ended up with two, the pecan pie and the caramel butter cake, both of which were, you guessed it, delicious!\n\nlet's talk about the staff and the service.  from the host that greeted us when we walked in, to the gentleman that walked us to our seats, to the three gentlemen that served us, everything and everyone was absolutely delightful.  the three gentlemen serving us were rene, brian, and david, and they ran like a well oiled machine.  they were very attentive and very pleasant people, and they helped make our dining experience so wonderful. \n\nthe ambiance was perfect for our early xmas dinner.  we had a table where we were able to comfortably eat dinner, have a conversation without screaming at each other, and we weren't wedged between other people being forced to share our dining experience with strangers. \n\ndefinitely a five star establishment with five star food and five star service. we will definitely be back."

            "this is my favorite restaurant in the united states, bar none.\n\nsome of the best service and atmosphere i've ever seen in a restaurant, anywhere. for example....\n\na few days before one visit, i called to request that the peanut butter cream pie, a dessert special from a past trip, be once again on the desert menu. when we showed up for dinner, we didn't see the pie on the menu, but were informed that the chef had made and saved an entire pie just for our party. it was unbelievable.\n\nand oh the food....\n\n** warning: this meal is a marathon. if you're not a big eater, don't be afraid to share appetizers, order smaller steaks, skip the rolls, etc so that you can room for all parts of this amazing, amazing meal.\n\n**** appetizers ****\n-- <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> is the clear ungodly standout.\n-- all the salads are routinely excellent.\n-- skip the <mark><mark>Ahi Tuna</mark> and Salmon Tartare</mark> and <mark>Heirloom Tomato Soup</mark> -- they aren't as impressive.\n-- the free rolls are really, really excellent.\n\n**** wine ****\n-- for those that (like me) enjoy wine but aren't connoisseurs, the fisticuffs cabernet is my go-to. it goes great with all steaks at a reasonable ($55) price.\n\n**** steak ****\n-- ribeye is the obvious play, and is amazing (and huge), but the filet is outstanding for those who want something smaller and not quite as rich.\n-- try <mark>Au Poivre Style</mark> for really powerful flavor. steak purists should do the ribeye straight up, but those who like peppery and lightly sweet flavors would love the filet au poivre.\n-- i am told that they serve entrees besides steak, but i have never, ever seen anyone be so misguided as to come here and fail to order a steak.\n\n**** sides ****\n-- usually we have one person order all the sides for the group, just to make sure we get a good mix of them so everyone can try everything. they're served family-style, and are big enough for ~3 people to have some.\n-- twice <mark>Baked Idaho Potato</mark> (which has gratuitous amounts of cheese and bacon) is incredible, albeit heavy. two can share, but my friends insist on ordering their own.\n-- mushrooms are some of the best i've had, and go perfectly with the steak.\n-- broccoli or asparagus is a good choice to contrast the rich steak.\n\n**** desserts ****\n-- oatmeal pecan pie is one of my favorite desserts anywhere. you will want a whole one yourself after one bite, so order accordingly.\n-- banana cream pie is well known and hyped, for good reason. it is also enormous.\n-- skip the bread pudding and peach cobblers -- they're good but not in the same league.",

            "located within restaurant row at the venetian, and still flying the banner of chef emeril lagasse under the direction of ronnie rainwater, it was at the behest of a friend that i returned to delmonico steakhouse on saturday afternoon and having contacted the kitchen in advance to be sure some dinner selections could be ordered during lunch the meal that followed was the sort of experience that left me scratching my head wondering why i'd not sat down at the restaurant in more than a half-dozen years, let alone why the space does not get the accolades it most certainly deserves.\n\nadmitting up front a fondness for emeril that stems from my first fine dining experience many years ago at his eponymous restaurant in orlando, not to mention several equally impressive visits to the celebrity chef's kitchens in las vegas and new orleans, it was mere moments after the restaurant's 11:30am opening that i checked in at the hostess stand and quickly led to a seat in the vast main dining area it was with exquisite service throughout that the afternoon would commence, visits from chef rainwater as well as the restaurant's gm and director of culinary operations sean roe helping to provide some background on sourcing, techniques, and their history with the man who made \"bam\" as much an ingredient as a phrase.\n\nrecently reinventing their logo and constantly tweaking a menu that features no lack of diversity to compliment several signatures, it was to two small popovers and a large bowl of truffled chips that the table was treated as menu decisions were made, and acknowledging that i knew the meal to be hosted even before sitting down a total of eighteen items were received, most of them self-selected, though a few were simply sent out.\n\ndining in an unfilled space as both the venetian and palazzo were without conventions on this rare weekend it was with somewhat jarring overhead tunes from the likes of the black keys, strokes, and arctic monkeys that the air above was filled and within fifteen minutes of placing our order the table was soon crowded with plates, a juicy and sizable steak burger brought to satisfy the table's youngest diner while the rest partook in silky duck liver with classic fruit and crispy bread accoutrements plus thick cuts of bacon that almost made the word look like a slight, each fork-tender bite supple without being fatty as brine was boldly balanced by root beer glaze reined in by pickled bits of watermelon rind.\n\ndeciding that a few seasonal plates as well as a classic would be best before progressing to entrees sure to be quite a bit more robust, it was with a light green salad alongside a fine riff on grilled cheese that round two began and with the <mark>Heirloom Tomato Soup</mark> as deep and vibrant as any in recent memory it's pairing to creamy ricotta on brioche was without doubt a hidden gem, the famous quartet of crustaceans every bit as snappy and smoky as remembered though the teensy biscuit still fails to make any sense.\n\nat this point ready and waiting for a <mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark> aged on premises for just short of 60-days it was quite the surprise when not only it, but also a piedmontese <mark>Bone-In New York Strip</mark> arrived, and with the desired earthy funk of the former bullet-pointed through the addition of butter the grassy wet-aged flavor of the piedmontese was a fork-tender study in bold contrast, both dinner-menu sides setting high standards for their respective ingredients as the crispy fried bird beneath finger-licking tomato glaze immediately stirred debate as to whether it was perhaps even better than that at nearby yardbird - a question that would make a great throwdown if the two restaurants could get sands corporation to set up such an event.\n\nnever once disappointed by dessert in an emeril establishment it was in one of those \"i'll take one of each\" menus that sweets were presented, but keeping in mind the days later eating and the fact that there were only three diners present a bit of restraint brought forth only five, the hefty application of whipped cream unfortunately muting the impact of key lime pie while both butter cake and cr\\u00e8me br\\u00fbl\\u00e9e were as rich as expected without doing much to challenge convention, the pecan pie and sweet potato donuts thus stepping into the spotlight as absolute must orders with the former almost devoid of filler as candied nuts melded with ice cream and caramel and the latter shockingly light at the center despite a shell as robust as that of the chicken, an aromatic autumnal taste rising high on the palate whether enjoyed on their own or dipped in espresso tinged foam.", 
            "this place is by far the best restaurant for impeccable service and incredible food. from start to finish, everything was spot on. nobody is perfect, but this place... this place is the definition of perfection. from the smiling hostesses to the personable server, frank, that not only was warm and welcoming, but even wholeheartedly supported their participation for restaurant week. even explained what three square was all about and let us know that the portion of each meal is donated to help the hunger. he genuinely wanted us to participate and even had the rw menu to show us when we sat down. not like some other steakhouse server *coughcough (smith&w) that hid this menu unless you mention it and when you do, they treat you cold as winter. not at this place, you feel like family or a special guest at someone's house. and this is just lunch for crying out loud. service felt like you're the most important person in the world. amazing.\n\nfrank was delightful to have as our server. he was informative, attentive, enthusiastic, and just had this kind, easy going presence about him. getting to know my father and i throughout our dining experience. it was so nice to have a server that actually wanted to know more about their guests. he was thrilled that we came for restaurant week and when i started ordering, he would say.. that's my favorite too love the burrata cheese or after i ordered the prime hamburgers.. he would say.. that burger is so juicy and delicious, you'll love it. it felt so good that the server is all for it. even his assistant said thank you each time she took a dish or utensils away. so sweet and kind!\n\nthe goods... everything. there wasn't a single thing that was mediocre. complimentary bread was like a light croissant mixed with herbs. the appetizers.. my father had the <mark>Heirloom Tomato Soup</mark> with grilled ricotta cheese sandwich, which was so good.. i didn't even get a chance to taste not even one bite of it. he was enjoying it so much that i didn't have the heart to interrupt his food romance. sh*t. i just wanted one bite!!! *sigh oh well.. i ended up enjoying the <mark>Vine-Ripened Heirloom Tomato Salad</mark> with my favorite burrata cheese, red onion, balsamic vinegar, and torn local basil. it was oh so freshly made. that burrata cheese just makes my day. loved every single bite of it.\n\nif you come here for rw... a must try.. delmonico's prime hamburger. on toasted brioche roll with fries, cheddar cheese, and bacon. i never in my life had a hamburger like this one. it was first class, first rate, love at first bite. outstanding flavors. even the sesame seed bun tasted buttery and oh so soft. so good, so good, unbelievably deeeeelicious. the size of this burger was enormous. my father had to cut it up like a steak to eat it. me, on the other hand ate it like a champ. i was full from eating only half of it, so was my father. the presentation itself was like art. even cutting it in half was beautiful. i'll be daydreaming about this burger probably for the rest of my life. my father kept on laughing, either from the sight of happiness of seeing this magnificent burger or he can't get over how huge this is. either way, he was enjoying himself and that makes me extremely happy to see. we, both had a splendid time here. \n\nboth desserts were wonderful.  the banana cream pie parfait with caramel sauce, chocolate shavings, whipped cream, and graham crumbs had this cooling effect. it's a great sweet summer treat. thick cream. the traditional bread pudding with warm caramel pecan sauce was soothing. generous amount of pecans. it was a seal deal to a great meal.\n\nafter the whole dining experience, this restaurant now tops as one of my favorite places in vegas. i never had a burger impress me until today. superb!!! fantastic service, food, and ambiance. lovelovelove this place :)", 
            "i mainly went for the ceasar salad prepared tableside.  i ate in the bar, the bartender was very nice and helpful.  i got the grilled cheese with <mark>Heirloom Tomato Soup</mark>.  grilled cheese was very good but the soup was nothing special.  now the salad that i read one reviewer said the best in vegas, which is the only reason i came.  knowing that they put anchovies in it when they prepare tableside, i was going to tell them to hold off on that once they get started.  so as im waiting for them to come up and make it, they bring it already prepared.  what is that?  the whole point of getting it is to watch it being done and see that its made fresh.  so obviously the anchovies were already in it, and since i explained i didnt want them, they made another.   i was told its a fire hazard to prepare it in the bar area so they made it on the side when i wasnt looking.  the few bites i took werent that good.  so i watch them make the 2nd salad in the hallway.  needless to say, it was totally flavorless, ive had better dressing from newmans own, and the lettuce was in long stems, not even cut up. i was very disappointed with the salad, although the other food looked good", 
            "had dinner here last week and i have one advice - do not get the prix fix!!  we had the <mark>Seafood Tower</mark>, which was great except for the <mark><mark>Ahi Tuna</mark> and Salmon Tartare</mark> on the top - the tuna did not taste fresh at all.  some of us got the summer prix fix option, which sounded like a great deal for $65.  all the appetizers were good, especially the <mark>Heirloom Tomato Soup</mark>/grilled cheese.  then the entrees came.  i had the petite ribeye, and it was seriously the worst steak i ever had.  it tasted like cheap top sirloin from sizzler, really tough & chewy.  emeril would be ashamed if he tasted it.  my daughter ordered off the regular menu and had the <mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark>, which was delicious.  maybe it was my fault for ordering the prix fix... i understand it's cheaper... but the quality was so poor and definitely no way near $65.  i'm giving them 2 stars for good appetizers but will be staying away from the prix fix menu."

            "delmonico steakhouse is at the venetian.\n\nafter the venetian lost my luggage last summer (see my venetian reviews for the entire story) i swore i wouldn't step foot in the venetian. it pains me to admit this, but i stepped foot in the venetian during my most recent vegas trip :(  just to clarify, this was not by choice, but by circumstance. me, my boyfriend, and 2 other couples wanted to do a nice dinner. long story short, one of the other couples raved about this restaurant and made dinner reservations for all of us. \n\nwith that being said, this steakhouse blew me away. it was surprisingly really good.  \n\n**appetizers: i had the <mark>French Onion Soup</mark> and my boyfriend had a salad. the appetizers were so-so. we definitely could've have done without ordering them since our entrees and sides were filling.\n\n**entrees: my boyfriend and i each ordered the bone in ribeye. had we known how huge they were, we would've just ordered one and shared. i was surprised at how good my steak was. i wanted to pull a \"fred flinstone\" and pick up the steak with my hands and gnaw on the entire thing.  my steak was prepared well, seasoned well, and tasted delicious. even with all that deliciousness there was just so much meat that neither of us finished our steaks. \n\n**sides: we had the creamed corn gratin & <mark>Potato Gratin</mark>. both of which were creamy and delicious.  \n\nthe service was fine, the ambiance was nice, the steak and sides were fantastic. i'm just annoyed that this restaurant is located in the venetian -_-"

            "my visit to delmonico steakhouse was in august for our annual wedding anniversary trip.  a few days ago, we received a postcard from delmonico steakhouse - from our waiter michael jackson :o)\nwhat a nice surprise!!  it was just a short note to say thank you for visiting their establishment and hope to see us soon.  \n\na little late - but here's my review....\n\nlet me start off by saying.. i wasn't too sure about visiting delmonico steakhouse since there are sooooo many restaurants that i want to try every time i go to vegas.  i think we've been to almost all the steak houses in vegas.  cut and craft.. some of our favorites.\n\nupon arrival.. we were seated within 3 minutes - which is a great start.  people that know me are well aware that i do not like waiting.  \nwe were directed to a nice booth area and my husband and i were able to sit by each other to \"people watch\". \n\nimmediately we were welcomed by our waiter, michael jackson.  we started off with 2 glasses of chardonnay - light and smooth. \nsince i wanted to try so many of the sides and apps.. i decided that i'd just share the steak with my husband..  \n\nsooo here's what we got:\n1. <mark>Wilted Spinach and Frise</mark> salad with poached egg and candied bacon\nreview:  i was pleasantly surprised that the poached egg was encased in panko crust and deep fried.  the candied bacon.. amazeballs\n\n2. baked oysters\nreview:  6 lovely oysters baked with garlic/parsley/parmeson  - what's not to love!!\n\n3. fried <mark>Truffle and Parmesan Potato Chips</mark> with truffle oil and garlic\nreview: amazeballs!!! nom nom nom  need i say more\n\n4. creamed corn\nreview:  creamy, sweet but great texture\n\n5. grilled asparagus\nreview:  grilled and seasoned to perfection\n\n6. bone in rib-eye\nreview:  seared perfectly.  light shade of pink - just how we like it.\n\n7. pecan tart\nreview:  amazing\n\nwe will definitely frequent delmonico steakhouse.  the service, the quality, the experience.. \n\nask for michael jackson!!", 
            "my husband and i ate here for thanksgiving dinner and really enjoyed our meal. \n\ni've eaten at many steakhouses in the area and i find that each one has their own unique style. delmonico's interior isn't highly decorated or cluttered, just a simple and clean look. i liked the simplicity. \n\nour waiter and his team were very attentive. water glasses were constantly filled, plates cleared efficiently, and service moved smoothly. they were all very professional. \n\nthe meal begins with popovers that are both soft and flavorful. i began my meal with the <mark>Wilted Spinach and Frise</mark> salad. it was anything, but the usual frisee salad because every ingredient was taken to the next level. the bacon vinaigrette had a nice smoky bacon flavor which was tossed in just the right amount with the spinach. the candied bacon was amazing. they perfectly balanced the sweet and salty. the egg on top was cooked to perfection. all of the flavors worked so well together. \n\nit was hard to order something other than steak, but it was thanksgiving so i had to have my traditional dinner. the thanksgiving dinner didn't disappoint and was a very generous portion. the turkey was very moist and flavorful. the plate had a nice mix of white and dark meat. under piles of turkey was a moist, delicious cornbread stuffing. a delicious gravy was drizzled over the turkey and stuffing. there was a small side of green beans, but those were not the best thing on the plate as they were a stringy and mushy.\n\nmy husband and i split a twice <mark>Baked Idaho Potato</mark> because you have to have potatoes on thanksgiving. i'm glad we split because it was definitely enough for two. the potato was flavorful and covered in a nice cheese layer.\n\nfor dessert i had the pecan pie and my husband had the thanksgiving dessert special. my pecan pie was served like a tart in a small round, flaky crust. the crust was buttery and flaky. i don't like crust usually, but this was very good. there was plenty of gooey pecan filing and a nice heap of ice cream on top. my husband's special dessert was a trio of pumpkin cheesecake, bread pudding, and ice cream. this kind of fell flat. nothing had much flavor and was certainly not the best representation of the dessert menu.\n\ni can't wait to return and try more of the regular menu items."

            "as i have been to the emeril delmonico restaurant in new orleans and enjoyed it immensely, i decided to have dinner at the delmonico steakhouse located in the venetian resort hotel & casino where i was attending the phantom of the opera later that evening (incredible show by the way!).  what you'll find is a variety of food selections with creole influences. \n\nfirst the menu prices are expensive ($$$$) but you are there for the intimate and fine dining experience and should be expecting to pay those prices.  what i didn't expect was to be dressed up and have an individual in shorts, sandals, and a baltimore colts jersey seated at an adjacent table to me.  kind of lowered my view of this establishment being world class if you know what i mean.\n\ni started with the <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> which was just superb but did lack the \"creole\" twist i was expecting (the bam factor).  only thing that was a little of an inconvenience was the lobster pieces were quite large and were hard to cut with my spoon.  the wife selected the <mark>Organic Baby Mixed Greens Salad</mark> creole spiced croutons, sherry vinaigrette, shaved manchego cheese roasted teardrop tomatoes and shaved red onion.  i had a taste and it was very good.  the different flavors were unique and distinctive.\n\nthe main course i selected a pinot noir wine that to go along with my ribeye steak and selected the <mark>Roasted Fingerling Potatoes</mark> and whole garlic with fresh herbs.  the wine was fantastic with a rich and bold body and floral aroma.  wasn't dry and complimented the ribeye steak very well.  the ribeye has emeril's classic touch written all over it with the blackened spice rub with a pat of herb butter on top.  the cut was 1-1/2 inches thick, lean, and very large portion.  the potato dish was okay, didn't impress me in any way.  the wife also had the pinot noir and selected the <mark>Filet Mignon</mark>.  the cut had to be nearly 2 inches thick, lean, and a normal portion size.  i recommend selecting your ribeye to be cooked medium rare (i do not recommend medium) and your <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> medium rare or at the most medium.  \n\nsorry to say we were extremely full when we finished and couldn't partake of dessert.  the meal described above with tip was roughly $210.", 
            "the bf and i went on a trip to vegas and decided to try delmonico steakhouse since i like emeril on the food network & had yet to eat at one of his restaurants. i would just like to say...service, service, service... the servers here are phenomenal. their recommendations were exactly what we were looking for and didn't know we wanted. about 1-2 week after our meal there, our waiter sent us a personalized and hand signed card to our house thanking us for our patronage and hoping to see us again. neither of us had had that happen before and haven't seen it since. \n\nto start, i had the <mark>Organic Baby Mixed Greens Salad</mark> with creole spiced croutons, sherry vinaigrette, shaved manchego cheese, teardrop tomatoes and red onion. i have been attempting to recreate this salad and dressing at home since we ate there. i then had the filet (i like to compare them from place to place), and it was delicious, so tender, and had a fantastic seared crust that gave it plenty of flavor. i also had the <mark>Potato Gratin</mark> and asparagus, which were both scrumptious. while this was an expensive meal, it was certainly a highlight to our trip to vegas.", 
            "i was (again) lucky enough to have lunch here to participate in an it seminar for my place of employment.  when has a free steak ever turned me down?\n\ndelmonico was no exception, good food!  i had wanted to try this place before but eating like a king on a pauper's salary just didn't cut it.  emeril has done a great job with his steakhouse here in las vegas.\n\nthe presenters for this it seminar were smart, they decided to make us go though a big chunk of their product presentation before letting us start to partake in our steak lunch.  that was smooth guys...make us sweat it out!  but the payoff was pretty good.  our menu was one created by the folks doing the seminar, it was a nice three-course meal.\n\nwe started off with delmonico's <mark>Organic Baby Mixed Greens Salad</mark> - topped with creole spiced croutons, shaved manchego cheese, teardrop tomatoes, shaved red onions, and a sherry vinaigrette.  excellent salad, light, tart, salty, and the croutons and red onions (i love them raw if they're sliced really thin) gave it some nice crunch.\n\nnext we had the choice of either a steak or salmon.  seeing as i was in a steakhouse and that i-like-a-the-beef, i naturally went for a steak.  on the menu was a petite ribeye - which was charbroiled usda prime aged, creole seasoned, and topped with butter.  got mine in a nice medium rare.  boy oh boy, was this a winner!  tender, succulent, cooked right, a nice kick from the creole seasoning, excellent i say.  i usually like a steak sauce with my steak...but alas, i did not need it!  i sopped up every last bit of the beefy goodness.  the side of <mark>Country Smashed Potatoes</mark> were good too, but you can guarantee i kept my focus on that lil' slice of heavenly ribeye!  it's up there with one of the most tastiest steaks i've had, and this was only a mini-me of the full size!  i took a look at some of the other diners steaks that weren't in on our seminar, and they were huge!  delmonico definitely puts out a lot of meat for the money.\n\nwe ended the menu with a chocolate tart of some sort, i cannot fully remember it off the top of my head because i really wasted most of my brain power consuming that steak.  but yes, that tart must have been pretty good because i do remember finishing that as well!\n\nquickly looking at the actual menu, delmonico is on par with pricing as other steakhouses in the area.  most steaks are hitting the $40-50 range, sides are around $9 a pop, with desserts around $10.  not cheap so if you're going here make sure it's a special occasion!  but then again, if you are rich i guess everyday would be a special occasion.", 
            "on our first night's stay at the venetian, we walked to delmonico in less than 5 minutes and were seated on time.  it took approximately 60 seconds for the staff to begin delivering the bliss.  i am not a steakhouse fan (my husband is), but this restaurant is an emeril restaurant, and having had wonderful experiences at his other establishments in new orleans, i thought we would be in for a treat.  the service was extraordinary even though the restaurant was hustling at by 8 p.m., we had the full attention of our waiter as well as the sommelier and other ancillary staff, which made the evening a lot of fun.  we enjoyed an amuse bouche of heirloom tomatoes, basil, burrata cheese and evoo.  my husband ended up with an enormous piece of meat on his plate (no surprise there) that he stated emphatically was the best steak he'd ever had, accompanied by a terrine-sized dish of the new orleans <mark>Delmonico Creamed Spinach</mark>, easily the best <mark>Delmonico Creamed Spinach</mark> i've ever put in my mouth.  i only wish i had been able to enjoy the leftovers in an omelette the next day for breakfast.\n\ni ordered one of the specials, which was a $42 plate of pasta.  yes, you read right: a $42 plate of pasta.  it was heaven: just the right amount of papparadelle with six very large shrimp, and a generous amount of andouille sausage and artichoke hearts.  i enjoyed a complementary glass of red wine that was a blend of several varietals; complex and nicely balanced, it was a wine that emeril endorsed and labeled, and it had been bottled by au bon climat winery in santa barbara, ca.  i started with the <mark>Organic Baby Mixed Greens Salad</mark>, dressed with a sherry vinaigrette and shaved manchego cheese.  it was perfectly balanced and just the right flavor profile for my mood that night.  we were too full for dessert, but had there been room, my money would have been on emeril's banana cream pie, served with caramel sauce, chocolate shavings and whipped cream. i didn't take pictures at delmonico, but we enjoyed our food immensely and i would return in a heartbeat.  the staff is well-trained and extremely attentive, and the food is unpretentious, well-prepared and top-drawer.", 
            "with all due respect to other steak places in vegas, delmonico knocks it out of the park! the bone in ribeye (delmonico), cream corn, cream spinach, potatoes gratin, even the <mark>Organic Baby Mixed Greens Salad</mark> were fantastic! the banana cream pie and even the quality of coffee were above par. our waiter michael and his co-staff were great. we have a now a total of three great experiences at delmonico. is it expensive, well isn't everything in vegas? it is a must every time we're in vegas.", 
            "had dinner on 6/26/13. this was the second time my wife and i dined at delmonico steakhouse. the 1st time i ordered the bone-in-ribeye and was disappointed because it had some gristle and was underwhelming to say the least. on this trip, the wife had the <mark>Organic Baby Mixed Greens Salad</mark> and the filet while i had the <mark>Creole Boiled Gulf Shrimp Cocktail</mark> and once again the bone-in-ribeye. we also shared an order of asparagus.\n\nthe filet was good - tender and nicely seasoned. my ribeye was disappointing, however. it was not very tender and didn't have much flavor for being dry-aged 2-3 weeks as per our waiter.\n\nthe service and atmosphere are on par with most of the other high-end steakhouses in vegas, but the steaks are not as good as those we have had at craftsteak, cut, n9ne, stripsteak, prime, or even stk. does not deserve more than 3 stars imo and even though it wasn't bad, it is not good enough for us to return especially with all the other choices in town."

            "i am not absolutely dying to go back, but i grew up in las vegas and can say that this one of the finer fine dining establishments. my mom, her boyfriend, my sister, and i ate here for a special occasion post-phantom and there wasn't a single mentionable flaw in the experience. everything was fresh, perfectly cooked to order, and tasted great. the service was attentive (though perhaps the tiniest bit slow toward the end of our meal) and friendly. \n\nthe ambiance was nice, excluding the \"old ladies' night out\" table nearby making a lot of drunken noise (they were just enjoying themselves but boy did one of them have a memorable cackle!) and would be suitable for a nice date.\n\ni recommend the caesar composed tableside as well as the <mark>Vine-Ripened Heirloom Tomato Salad</mark> to begin with. i enjoyed my seared tuna and the steak and scallops i tasted were excellent, as was the tiramisu for dessert .", 
            "i seem to have really good luck with emeril's restaurants. after my recent visit to delmonico's, i'm beginning to think he can't go wrong. from the moment we walked in the door, it was just instantly different from all the other restaurants we visited. we were greeted warmly, seated immediately even though we were early, and had friendly, attentive service the entire time. \n\nthe atmosphere inside delmonico's is not at all what i would have expected, but it is simple and lovely. the colors are warm, the lighting is excellent (especially at a steakhouse, i need to be able to see my food!), and the decor is plain and easy on the eyes (not a lot of decoration at all).\n\nwe started with some <mark>Truffle and Parmesan Potato Chips</mark> and a <mark>Vine-Ripened Heirloom Tomato Salad</mark> to share while we were getting settled. vince curled up with the wine list with a big, giant grin on his face. ah, so many choices to go with steak, but we can't really go wrong with chambolle musigny, so there you go, and we threw in a bottle of sancerre to start. \n\ni ended up getting emeril's famous <mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark>, vince got the filet, and phil and alexandra got bbq shrimp and mushroom medallions. we also got an assortment of sides, including spinach, asparagus, mushrooms, and garlic <mark>Country Smashed Potatoes</mark>. for someone who likes pure, unadulterated meat, my ribeye was about as perfect as you can get. cooked to my desired rare plus bloodiness, with a simple crust of emeril's essence, a beautiful quality cut without any tendons or gristle, just beautiful meatiness. vince's filet was similarly perfect, nice and thick and bloody, with a delicious cajun rub that enhanced the meat without overpowering it. i was impressed with alexandra's medallions - they were pretty large for medallions; they looked like big 4 oz filets in their own right. i'd had the shrimp before at emeril's seafood restaurant so that was nothing new but those were also good. the spinach actually tasted like spinach (rather than cream), and the asparagus was nice and al dente. \n\ni finished up with some pecan pie, a generous jamaica blue mountain espresso (i was impressed that the coffee list provided a wide variety of espressos from which to choose), and a cognac. too bad it was only lunch! this meal was certainly the highlight of our trip (in addition to being the best, it was also the least expensive). afterwards our server took us on a tour of the restaurant. next time we are definitely going to try to reserve the chef's table. i already can't wait!",

            "food: 4 \nservice: 2.5 \n\ndelmonico's was one of the first fancy-schmanchy places i'd eaten at in vegas. however the last time i ate there was close to five years ago and i've eaten at many other places since then. my husband was eager to try it out again to see if it was as good as he remembered it to be. \nin summary, i'd say the food was good, the service- not so much. \nwe were lead to our table in the back of the restaurant and even though it was nearly 10:00 pm, the restaurant was really crowded. i was pretty surprised but perhaps this is part of the reason we didn't receive the greatest service. \nfor the appetizer, i had ordered some sort of <mark>Vine-Ripened Heirloom Tomato Salad</mark> thing from the specials that sounded really interesting. in fact, it was one of the items the server had recommended. however, about 5-10 minutes after ordering, the server came by and informed me they were out of it and asked me if i would like to order something else. the weird thing was, he wasn't apologetic at all, he simply said something along the lines of, \"we're out of that, do you want to get another salad?\" i'm not going to say he was downright rude but for a restaurant of this caliber, i definitely expected at the very least, some sort of apology. perhaps even a free appetizer or dessert but perhaps i'm expecting too much? i settled on the salad with goat cheese and i do have to say it was delicious, one of the tastiest salads i can remember having in a long time. however, the journey in getting to that salad was a little bumpy. my husband had a pretty standard garden salad that i tasted and it was pretty good too. \nanother problem with our ordering is when i tried to order my filet and they asked how i wanted it cooked, i told them my usual method of between medium and medium well, no blood. okay, i know i am a little difficult but i've never had a problem with a place accommodating my request so at a high end steakhouse, i did not even consider that this would be a difficult task. well, our server just flat out said he didn't think he could do that. uhhh, what? really? it's as if the steak was being cooked in a microwave with only set levels. it was so weird. so i was a little miffed. with that being said, my steak and my husband's steak was cooked properly when it came out. just a shame that i had to get hazed about it when ordering. all our sides (grits, mushrooms, and spinach) had very generous portions and were pretty good too but perhaps but no real standouts either. \neven though the steaks were a few dollars pricier than other comparable steakhouse such as carnevino, i did appreciate that the three steak sauces came free. other places charge $2-$3 per sauce so it really balanced out and it was nice to try all three. \ni can never resist dessert so i got something i believed was some sort of banana tart. i was surprised when something resembling a big hunk of mud pie with a giant mound of whip cream came out. i took a few bites but it was a bit overwhelming for me. \nall in all, i would say the food was good but not as good as i remembered it five years ago. or perhaps i've been spoiled by the different restaurants i've been to since then. my biggest complaint was the service- not only the issues as stated above but just overall, the service felt impersonal and disjointed. i would have to guess that since the restaurant seemed very busy and it was near the end of the night by the time of our reservation, the servers had probably run out of patience. understandable, we've all had bad days at work but i don't like feeling like the scapegoat. \ni still wouldn't hesitate in recommending delmonico's to people since my food was good but perhaps i'd recommend a reservation earlier in the day and hope that would alleviate the service issues.", 
            "i always try to come here whenever i visit las vegas.  this is probably one of my favorite steakhouses.  i made a reservation with the request of a nice private table.  i arrived at the restaurant and was immediately greeted by the hostess.  i was about 10 minutes early, but being thirsty i wanted to get a drink at the bar anyway.  i ordered a tanqueray and tonic and my date a glass of wine.  drink was made well, just the right amount of gin.  the bar area is nice with a few tables along with the view people walking to and fro from the palazzo.  \n\nwe were brought to out table, a nice and private one which i requested.  our server arrived and told us about the specials for the evening.  the one that stood out was the <mark>Vine-Ripened Heirloom Tomato Salad</mark>.  i then previewed the wine list, which was very very extensive.  i eventually decided on a bone <mark>Bone-In New York Strip</mark> medium rare and my date a scallop dish, as she did not really eat steak.  we also ordered the <mark>Delmonico Creamed Spinach</mark> and mashed potatoes.  we received the <mark>Vine-Ripened Heirloom Tomato Salad</mark>.  the salad was amazing, tomatoes were fresh and full of flavor and just had the right amount of seasoning and dressing (o&v).  when produce is that good, it's always wise to treat it simply, which delmonico did.  after our salad, the server brought over an amuse bouche on the house, which i've had previously.  a tortilla chip with a simple seafood ceviche.  it tasted decent, though i like my ceviche with a little more acid.  i couldn't complain because it was on the house.  a few moments later our main courses arrived.  my steak was cooked perfectly medium rare and just enough seasoning that served to enhance the flavor of the steak.  i could also tell that this <mark>Bone-In New York Strip</mark> was of a high quality cut because of the lack of connective tissue and sinews.  my date's scallop dish was very delicious, but i was so focused on my steak i forgot what the scallops came with, i believe it was served over polenta.  the <mark>Delmonico Creamed Spinach</mark> was decent, though i am usually not a fan of such a heavy side.   the mashed potatoes also were decent.  however the star during this dinner was the steak.  \n\nservice was impeccable.  staff was very friendly and everything came out the way we wanted, in the proper time.  \n\ndelmonico never disappoints.  the only other steakhouse that rivals this in lv is \"cut.\"  though i like the ambience in delmonicos better.  will i come back? yes!!! 5 stars because of phenomenal food, great ambience and impeccable service.", 
            "i've watched emeril on the foodnetwork channel for years.. i even used to tape his shows through my vcr (yes vhs tapes). i have heard of this place through a friend that told me that everytime his brother goes to vegas he eats here. so, when i found out that it was emeril's restaurant, i was even more eager to try this place! well, i finally had the chance to experience this restaurant, whose owner is one of the most enthusiastic and giddy chef's around! \n\ni had made reservations a couple hours prior and when we got there we were seated within seconds. place was pretty occupied with plenty of men dressed in suits, a few couples and  loud crowds that had their drunken voices echoing throughout the restaurant. all the staff members were well postured with every movement from pouring drinks to picking up finished plates off the table. the place is contemporary, a minimalist dream with large and very comfortable dining chairs.\n\nthe order:\n\n<mark>Vine-Ripened Heirloom Tomato Salad</mark>: tomatoes were juicy, plump and tasted so fresh. the tomatoes combined with the red onion, fresh mozzarella, extra virgin olive oil and balsamic vinegar = 4.5/5 stars\n\n<mark>Lobster Bisque</mark>: wow! i've had this dish a couple other times at other fancy restaurants and this one just blew those away! the flavor of the soup was smooth and had just the right amount of lobster flavor, not rich at all. came with a few pieces of lobster.. what a tease! \n\n<mark>Potato Gratin</mark>: came in a mini pan with the whole top completely lightly crusted brown. i grabbed my fork, broke into the soft crust and scooped up bite with a little bit of everything on it (crust,  potato and cheese). one of the better potato side dishes i've ever had!\n\n<mark>Creamed Corn Gratine</mark>: also came in a mini pan with a crumble/breaded top layer. the breading went well with the corn but overall it was just good.\n\nbone in rib steak: server asked me if i wanted emeril's essence and slice of butter placed on my steak. i told him that i wanted it the way it should be served.. shortly, the steak was finally served with a thin slice of butter with the evident emeril magic dust \"bam!\" sprinkled over  the meat. it was a healthy portion and did look fantasteak! not the softest steaks i've had but had a nice chew, not the juiciest but was far from dry, overall had a very well rounded quality to it. no complaints! \n\nemeril's banana cream pie: came tall with layers whip cream, generous amount of banana slices, banana cream and thin crust. there was also chocolate sprinkled/shavings  on top and caramel spread on the bottom. a great way to finish a fine dinner! \n\n*also had a glass of some french honey wine to compliment the pie, it was on the sweeter side but worth trying.\n\nbeing a fan of emeril for years, had high expectations.. the place delivered but not with flying colors..",

            "dined there last weekend with some friends and we were utterly disappointed. not impressed one bit.\ni don't understand how this restaurant received such high ratings, but i certainly would not go back nor would i recommend to anyone.\nfrom the food, the service, the ambiance - huge let down.\n\ni would've given this place an additional star if the service wasn't so terrible.  the server was slow and was more interested in chatting.  also, we waited at least 30 min to get our entrees(they didn't even seem busy). \nafter our table was cleared from apps and salads, we waited 20+ min before calling our server to check up on our food. she said it was still within the \"window\" and she couldn't do anything. luckily, she spoke to her manager after another 5-10 min because that's when our food was \"officially late.\" \n\nwhat we had (from what i can recall):\nbbq shrimp - shrimps were cooked unevenly and drowned in mediocre bbq sauce. some were cooked well, but mine was under. \n<mark>Vine-Ripened Heirloom Tomato Salad</mark> - nothing special\nbaked crab stuffed lobster - <mark>Roasted Maine Lobster Tail</mark> cooked well, but tough to eat and nothing amazing\nny strip - no flavor\nfilet - nice crust from the essence stuff\nsauteed <mark>Sauted Garlic Mushrooms</mark> - standard\n<mark>Potato Gratin</mark> - bit on the dry side\ncreamed corn gratin - best side order we had on the table, but that doesn't mean much.\n\ndessert:\nsorbet, banana cream pie, apple fritters, key lime pie.\nthe desserts and our bottle of wine were probably the highlight of this dinner.\n\nif you are looking for a good steakhouse on the strip, this is not the place.\nyou'll probably have better luck at mastro's, stripsteak, prime, or craftsteak.", 
            "as vegas steakhouses go, delmonico is a fine choice. i've been there twice and both times i've had very good meals. with that said, meeting expectations at this high price point is challenging, and particularly on my most recent visit i'm afraid delmonico should have been even better. this year we had a large company dinner at delmonico, so i was able to try lots of dishes. \n\nwe started with the bbq shrimp and the <mark>Butternut Squash Ravioli</mark>. the shrimp was good but a little overcooked. the squash was on the rich side but really tasty - you couldn't have but so many so it is good that they list it as an appetizer rather than as a pasta main. i loved one or two but a plateful would've been too much.  i also tried the <mark>Truffle and Parmesan Potato Chips</mark>, which were wonderful but extremely truffley. \n\nthe <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> was textbook, exactly what <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> is supposed to be - rich and creamy with chunks of tender lobster meat. still i might have preferred my neighbor's <mark>Vine-Ripened Heirloom Tomato Salad</mark>, which i tried and thought was one of the highlights of the meal.  i didn't try it but the duck from the smoked duck salad was not well received by another of my colleagues. \n\nfor my entr\\u00e9e i had the delmonico signature steak - a <mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark>. this is where the meal fell down ever so slightly. the steak was fine but for the premium price it should have been exceptional and it definitely wasn't. my order of medium rare was barely pink at all and was probably served on the dark side of medium, and i thought the meat was surprisingly devoid of flavor. don't get me wrong - it was a fine steak, but it was average among the steaks i've had in las vegas, at all price points. one of my close work friends who has frequented delmonico for years ordered the same cut at the dinner and he agreed that for his steak too it was an off-night. of the sides i loved the creamed corn. next time i'd do the mashed potatoes over the scalloped potatoes, which i found undercooked and under seasoned. the asparagus was also fine but unspectacular. \n\nthe bread pudding was great and the key lime pie (or was it cheesecake?) was nice too, but i'll reserve my sweetest accolades for the banana cream pie. best bite of the night. one of the best i've had. wonderful.", 
            "let's be honest: steakhouses are a dime-a-dozen in las vegas. every which way you look, there's some place that's being advertised as \"the best steakhouse in nevada!\" or \"the las vegas steakhouse\" or \"if elvis were alive, he would eat here!\"\n\nnot all steakhouses are created equal -- delmonico is proof of that.\n\nsituated in between the palazzo and the venetian, delmonico is unassuming from the outside. it looks simple and classy. once you step inside, however, you realize that comfort is their highest priority. the chairs are deep and made of the most comfortable leather. you won't want to get up when you're finished with your meal. \n\nthis was our second visit (our first for lunch), and i must say that the service was just as attentive and cordial as they had been the first time. both of our servers were named peter (which turned out to be quite humorous when we called out for one and they both came running), and they were extremely pleasant. they had absolutely no problem recommending dishes or letting us know their personal favorites. \n\nfor my appetizer, i had the <mark>Vine-Ripened Heirloom Tomato Salad</mark>. the tomatoes were ripe, juicy, and delicious. the accompanying cheese was a perfect pair to offset the acidity of the tomatoes. thin slivers of onions covered the perimeter of the plate, which were also very nice.\n\ni chose the fillet of beef medallions for my entree, and i was impressed with how absolutely wonderful they were. about a half-dollar in diameter and an inch tall, they were perfectly cooked, not to mention topped in parmesan cheese and drizzled with homemade worcestershire sauce. \n\ndelmonico doesn't need to be one of those places that wears people out with advertising. they know how good they are, and they aren't afraid to knock your socks off. i would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a relaxing way to enjoy an evening with good people and great food.", 
            "this is has been on my list for a while, so it was one of my first choices for spring restaurant week this year. i came here for lunch during the week with fellow yelpers and we took advantage of their $30.14 prie fixe menu (three square $4 donation). i also utilized open table to make my reservation.\n\nthe three of us started with the <mark>Vine-Ripened Heirloom Tomato Salad</mark> for our appetizer. the fresh heirloom tomatoes (2-3 different types/colors) were served with a dollop of creamy burrata cheese, red onion, extra virgin olive oil, balsamic vinegar, and fresh local basil. really crisp and refreshing; great start to our meal.\n\nfor the entr\\u00e9e, i selected the delmonico's prime hamburger served on a toasted brioche roll with cheddar cheese, crispy bacon, and the usual fixings (lettuce, tomato, onion). it was perfectly medium rare with juices oozing out with every squeeze. the burger had great flavor and seasoning, so that made it stand out from other burgers i've had. it was also an extremely generous portion. i could barely finish half of it (and i eat a lot). my only complaint was that although the burger started out juicy and delicious, it dried out really quickly and made it almost difficult to eat. i'm not sure what attributed to this, but it was odd. the fries were delicious! a unique preparation of crispiness.\n\ni also had the opportunity to taste the <mark>Butternut Squash Ravioli</mark> prepared with sage brown butter, toasted hazelnuts, and parmesan cheese and pan roasted atlantic salmon served with a sweet corn and crab vinaigrette and fresh basil. both were really delicious! the salmon was so soft with a succulent rareness in the center of the filet. i was also really impressed with the large chunks of crab meat and whole kernels of corn.\n\nfor dessert, i opted for the white chocolate macadamia nut bread pudding with vanilla bean cr\\u00e8me anglaise. i'm glad someone else chose emeril's banana cream pie because it was a tough decision for me (both being my favorite desserts). the bread pudding was moist, warm, and very yummy. the pecan caramel-like sauce was a bit sweet, but fortunately, the pudding was not. the banana cream pie was topped with caramel sauce, chocolate shavings, and whipped cream. yum. it was good, but i'll have to order one in the future to get a really good taste of it.\n\nthe restaurant is nice and i like the dimly lit rooms with spotlights on each table. it wasn't very busy during our meal, but i'm sure it would still be that nice and quiet. the service was also phenomenal. i was extremely pleased with the offering of harney & sons tea (transported in the most gorgeous wooden box display) and the fact that it was complimentary. everyone was so prompt to refill my pot with hot water and of course, it was served with fresh lemon and honey. we also stayed past their lunch service and they were so kind to allow us to loiter for that long.", 
            "i bring customers for dinner here every year during the isc trade show for the past 7 years- and it always is the right decision. the drinks are some of the best on the strip, the <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> and locally grown <mark>Vine-Ripened Heirloom Tomato Salad</mark> ( yep a greenhouse in vegas and the cheese made in house)  is to die for, and everyone that had steak said it was full of flavor and cooked perfectly. i had the salmon special and it was great as their fish dishes always are.  until last week i was never a fan of key lime pie- but when we got several desserts for the table the key lime pie was one of them.. and although i went in with hesitation... it was hands down the best dessert on the table...so the new rule for me is key lime pie- but only at delmonico!  as all things with the emeril name impeccable service was our experience - even with a trade show crowd and a large private whiskey tasting event. our water glasses were never less than 2/3 full, a server was always there for another drink or any issue. the pace of our meal was first rate. i'll be back again next year!", 
            "i'll start with this: i'm not a fan of emeril lagasse.\n\nwhy? i don't know. i've never really been a fan. when food network showed actual shows instead of guy fieri and his 90's hair, emeril, bobby flay, tyler florence, and giada ruled the network. oh, and michael chiarello, but i've been to his restaurant and that was phenomenal. that aside, bam! was the most popular saying in the food world, people flipped their shit over it, and now emeril has his face on every cheaply made saucepan and spice around grocery stores for twice the markup. i always thought he was off-putting.\n\nthat being said, this is a seafood/steakhouse, and it's upscale. i've been to cut, so i know that wolfgang puck is better than his canned soups. there's a chance emeril would live up to the (very pricey) hype.\n\nthe drinks were good - a cab and a pinot noir were actually quite nice, and the cocktails looked amazing. maybe your bar staff can teach your kitchen staff a little something about pride in their product.\n\nfirst up: the <mark>Vine-Ripened Heirloom Tomato Salad</mark> with burrata. am i supposed to eat through the thick, rock hard center of this tomato? are you serious? i paid $20+ for a salad that consisted of five slices of heirloom tomato and a dollop of burrata on top, and you're going to give me several slices that were pure unripened tomato? fuckin hell. i was disappointed. okay? so disappointed. come on, how fucking hard is it to serve a ripe tomato?\n\nfor the entree we ordered the wagyu ribeye and the <mark>Ahi Tuna</mark>. the tuna was fine - it was tuna. i'd opt for two pieces, as pepper crusted seared ahi for me can get overwhelming after a while (nigiri is a totally different situation). the battered mushrooms were a nice touch, as well as the sauce.\n\nbut the wagyu. okay, look. you're paying $90 for a fucking steak. for a steak that isn't kobe - please, for the love of god, don't confuse the two. and it's not big, it's small. is it wonderfully marbled with fat? yes! to me, it was great! i thought it was wonderful! but this is why my review just went down a star while writing this:\n\nwhen you pay $90 for a goddamn steak, you'd better bring it out hot. like, searing hot. like on a 400f plate like mastros, hot. right off the goddamn pan hot. when it comes out just barely hot anymore, and then slips right into lukewarm, what the fuck? what kind of $90 experience is that? the cow has given it's life, with the production of so many people trying to make it wonderful, and you ruin the experience. plus it was a little too salty.\n\nyou're probably thinking, \"jesus jaime, you're a bit of a prick, and a snob. i can see your brain from how high you're holding your nose from here.\"\n\nyeah, alright. i'll give you that. but you know what? i'm not going to pay fucking $90 for a goddamn steak if it isn't treated perfectly. i can get a $25 steak that's handled better than that, i don't give a fuck if it hasn't been drinking beer all its life.\n\nthen, to top off the evening of great disappointments, i ordered dessert. how hard is it to fuck this up? when you have a great meal, you want to finish it with a bang, right? so you have the one thing on the menu people like (apparently the banana cream pie), and then fuck it to the rest of the dessert menu, right? for fucks sake people, great dessert isn't that hard! it's so easy. even worse, it's the biggest profit maker! if you call that chocolate truffle cake a cake when it's drier than the sahara desert, and that strawberry shortcake as such when there was barely any actual shortcake, and the strawberries were mostly unripened with green parts on them, with a dollop of whipped cream on the side of the plate...then you should send your pastry chef back to school because clearly they need a kick in the ass.\n\nthis is an expensive meal where they prey off the idea that the people who come don't have any appreciation for the things they serve, so their level of care goes right out the 37th floor window of any hotel on the strip.", 
            "this place is by far the best restaurant for impeccable service and incredible food. from start to finish, everything was spot on. nobody is perfect, but this place... this place is the definition of perfection. from the smiling hostesses to the personable server, frank, that not only was warm and welcoming, but even wholeheartedly supported their participation for restaurant week. even explained what three square was all about and let us know that the portion of each meal is donated to help the hunger. he genuinely wanted us to participate and even had the rw menu to show us when we sat down. not like some other steakhouse server *coughcough (smith&w) that hid this menu unless you mention it and when you do, they treat you cold as winter. not at this place, you feel like family or a special guest at someone's house. and this is just lunch for crying out loud. service felt like you're the most important person in the world. amazing.\n\nfrank was delightful to have as our server. he was informative, attentive, enthusiastic, and just had this kind, easy going presence about him. getting to know my father and i throughout our dining experience. it was so nice to have a server that actually wanted to know more about their guests. he was thrilled that we came for restaurant week and when i started ordering, he would say.. that's my favorite too love the burrata cheese or after i ordered the prime hamburgers.. he would say.. that burger is so juicy and delicious, you'll love it. it felt so good that the server is all for it. even his assistant said thank you each time she took a dish or utensils away. so sweet and kind!\n\nthe goods... everything. there wasn't a single thing that was mediocre. complimentary bread was like a light croissant mixed with herbs. the appetizers.. my father had the <mark>Heirloom Tomato Soup</mark> with grilled ricotta cheese sandwich, which was so good.. i didn't even get a chance to taste not even one bite of it. he was enjoying it so much that i didn't have the heart to interrupt his food romance. sh*t. i just wanted one bite!!! *sigh oh well.. i ended up enjoying the <mark>Vine-Ripened Heirloom Tomato Salad</mark> with my favorite burrata cheese, red onion, balsamic vinegar, and torn local basil. it was oh so freshly made. that burrata cheese just makes my day. loved every single bite of it.\n\nif you come here for rw... a must try.. delmonico's prime hamburger. on toasted brioche roll with fries, cheddar cheese, and bacon. i never in my life had a hamburger like this one. it was first class, first rate, love at first bite. outstanding flavors. even the sesame seed bun tasted buttery and oh so soft. so good, so good, unbelievably deeeeelicious. the size of this burger was enormous. my father had to cut it up like a steak to eat it. me, on the other hand ate it like a champ. i was full from eating only half of it, so was my father. the presentation itself was like art. even cutting it in half was beautiful. i'll be daydreaming about this burger probably for the rest of my life. my father kept on laughing, either from the sight of happiness of seeing this magnificent burger or he can't get over how huge this is. either way, he was enjoying himself and that makes me extremely happy to see. we, both had a splendid time here. \n\nboth desserts were wonderful.  the banana cream pie parfait with caramel sauce, chocolate shavings, whipped cream, and graham crumbs had this cooling effect. it's a great sweet summer treat. thick cream. the traditional bread pudding with warm caramel pecan sauce was soothing. generous amount of pecans. it was a seal deal to a great meal.\n\nafter the whole dining experience, this restaurant now tops as one of my favorite places in vegas. i never had a burger impress me until today. superb!!! fantastic service, food, and ambiance. lovelovelove this place :)", 
            "i came for a restaurant week lunch with my two lovelies, sandra and david and my husband joined before he headed to work. this 3 course was $30.15.\n\nthe 3 of us not working that day ordered beverages. this place made my heart sing because they had a whisky book. to be handed pages upon pages to browse on top of the other spirits, wine menu and cocktail menus made my damn head spin because i wanted a lot of things. i settled on getting the scarlet starlet which had glenmorangie 10, tuaca, lime, hibiscus, strawberry and egg whites. it was totally up my alley - very much the scotch shined then the balance of the rest of the ingredients came through. very much worth the $16 in alcohol and skill in mixing- the bartender michelle was great.\n\nappetizer i got <mark>Vine-Ripened Heirloom Tomato Salad</mark> (with burrata cheese, red onion, balsamic vinegar and torn local basil) which was standard, but good because the components were quality and fresh. \n\nentree i got pan roasted atlantic salmon( with sweet corn & crab vinaigrette and fresh basil) which was nicely cooked and was very fresh and clean. i liked the large pieces of lump crab mixed in with the corn. \n\ndessert the hubby and i shared:\n\nbanana cream pie parfait(caramel sauce, chocolate shavings, whipped cream and graham crumbs) was a solid dessert that could convince someone who doesnt like banana cream. the custard in it was creamy while still being light. \n\ntraditional bread pudding(with warm caramel pecan sauce) i love bread pudding and this was good, but average. i do appreciate that the caramel was flavorful while not being saccharine sweet.\n\ni thought it was a solid lunch, but i am coming back for drinks as there's very few places on the strip i've enjoyed the beverage offerings as this. fantastic beverage program for the libation lover.",

            "husband suggested that we come back here for lunch today. they started us off with two bread poppers each which were not bad. i ordered a <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> soup as starter which was insanely delicious. probably one of the better <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> i've ever tasted.  it has big chunks of lobster meat in the soup.  although the first sip of the soup seemed a little salty, the flavor is very good, strong and savory. it is one of my favorite dishes here. \n\nmy husband ordered the <mark>Beef Carpaccio</mark> arugula salad because the salad we normally order from here is no longer on the menu. we were not sure what to order but after we tasted the salad we loved it. it is a very large salad which almost felt like a meal and it has a very clean balanced savory taste.  my husband says that this was one of his favorite salads; me on the other hand i still like the old salad i used to older here.  maybe i'm just more old-school and like my salad plain with arugula, spinach, tomatoes and good cheese. \n\nwe ordered two entr\\u00e9es. one was the salmon entr\\u00e9e which was insanely divine. it is served with a big piece of salmon fillet with grilled sweet corn and crab pieces which complimented the salmon impeccably. both my husband and i love this dish and we both indicated that we will be ordering this again in the future when we come back here. in fact we may each order one of this salmon dish. that is how much we love this dish. it is very delicious. any salmon lover should definitely give the salmon dish a try.\n\nthe other entr\\u00e9e that we ordered was the lobster sliders. i did not know that this was a cold sandwich dish. i personally do not like cold sandwiches and also i only like my lobster done the traditional way so that you can taste the natural fresh sweet flavors of a good lobster. the lobster sliders had some kind of seasoning/dressing to it. although they did not skimp on the lobster meat and they do give you a lot of big chunks of lobster meat with the sliders, the taste was not to my personal liking. i think i will stick with the salmon entr\\u00e9e and my <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> in the future.\n\ncome check out this place when you're in town. you will not be disappointed."

            "wow. that rib eye steak was awesome! so were the appetizers, <mark>Caesar Salad</mark>, sides, dessert, and wine. we went all out here and ordered much more than our stomachs could handle. but it was all so good i had to eat every last bit and piece.\n\nthe steak was seasoned and cooked perfectly. it was extremely tasty and was a nice big cut. the service was excellent. the <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> which was created table-side was fun to watch and tasted incredible. it would have been nice if they gave us a little bit more time between the salad and when our steaks came out. the steaks were actually waiting for us in the aisle before we had completed our salad.\n\nthis meal was a fun place to go out with a group and the food was very high quality.", 
            "the steakhouse is like most traditional steakhouses. the decor was very clean and contemporary. the hostesses weren't all that attractive and would rate about a 5-6 in my scale of looks and their demeanor looked as if they did not really care to be there at all. \n\nthe dining area is half filled with patrons and business people alike chatting away about their day and how excellent the steak was prepared the beautiful burgundy high leather chairs is a nice touch and their seating area is plush and soft. the booth seating is a high suede sofa like seating and the tables were all lined with clean white linens and set in standard of most fine dining establishments. \n\ni took my seat and i was greeted by the waiter and the captain and was asked about my choice of entree. i decided to go with their <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> and go with my good instincts that this would be the best choice. the chef prepared all the appetizers for a sampling. classic jumbo <mark>Creole Boiled Gulf Shrimp Cocktail</mark>, <mark>Truffle and Parmesan Potato Chips</mark>, classic <mark>Caesar Salad</mark>, fried calamari, and mixed green salad. \n\nthe classic jumbo <mark>Creole Boiled Gulf Shrimp Cocktail</mark> with a extremely spicy cocktail sauce wasn't as good as i expected. the shrimp were cooked well and the shrimp were presented beautifully, however, the spicy cocktail sauce did not please my taste buds or my nostrils for that matter. the sauce was like eating a handful of wasabi.\n\n the extremely addicting <mark>Truffle and Parmesan Potato Chips</mark> were excellent and should be ordered every time any patron enters this restaurant. the chips were drizzled with truffle oils and shaved parmesan cheese and each individual chip melted as you put them in your mouth. \n\nthe classic <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> had much to desire. the way the salad was prepared was not my idea of a good salad. it was literally a huge chunk of romaine lettuce with the heart in tact served with a plain and unappealing caesar dressing. i don't like how fancy restaurants can slap a big chunk of romaine lettuce on a plate and call it a classic <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> just to be different. don't mess with a good thing!\n\nthe fried calamari was ok at best, not my favorite but definitely worth a taste. the mixed green salad was a way a salad should be prepared and had just the right amount of dressing. the waiter was attentive and knew what drinks were ordered. the plates were cleared but seemed like sometimes dead plates were left around. not a good sign of service. \n\nthe entree finally came and the presentation could have been better but the filet was ammmmazing. the steak knife cut through the filet like a butter knife through room temperature butter. the steak was cooked to medium rare perfectly and encrusted with some new orleans style spices. i truly enjoyed the filet till the very last bite. one thing i do have to mention is the dessert. i would highly recommend the famous emeril's banana cake. this thing was pure heaven and was absolutely delicious. i could not even describe it in words if i even tried so i won't! so you will have to try it for yourself. \n\noverall the experience was good, food was good but not the best i have tried, and the service was ok by my standards, but my standards can be high. my favorite parts were the filet and the dessert, the appetizers once again could have been better with the exception of the <mark>Truffle and Parmesan Potato Chips</mark>, mmm! delicious! i would recommend this place for dinner or lunch, however, the price can be a little daunting. i was calculating the totals of a appetizer, entree, and dessert and was estimating about 70-100 dollars a person with tip. that can look a little scary for some people, but for the meal and experience i'd say that was definitely worth it! many thanks for reading. till next time.", 
            "he may be a tv celebrity chef, but you can't take away credit where credit is due: emeril is a fantastic restaurateur.  my wife and i have dined here twice; the first time because we were staying at the venetian and the second time we purposely came back to eat here on one of our anniversaries while staying in vegas.  in short this is a fantastic formal steakhouse experience all around.  what sold us was the chateaubriand for two. expertly cooked and finished off by table side with a flame of cognac for that over-the-top vegas style experience.  quite possibly one of the most memorable steaks we've had in our life. tender with an explosion of flavor when you take a bite, mmm.  there are several wonderful side dishes you can choose to complement the meat and so far we haven't been disappointed in any of them whether you go for the vegetable of the day (garlic pan fried green beans the last time were there) or the bacon and cheddar grits, mashed potatoes, or <mark>Baked Idaho Potato</mark>. oh and for your prerequisite greenery before the meat course they also do a fantastic <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> prepared at table side for 2 as well.  desert? yes please!  you can't go wrong with their caramel cream brulee but everything on their dessert menu looked sweetly decadent.  i don't think i need bother describing the wine or drink menu here other than this is vegas after all and if you possibly couldn't find what you're after here to complement your meal then i'm sure they could get it for you.", 
            "being that i am in real estate, i can't tell you how excited i was to be treated to a chi-chi expensive dinner that probably ended up costing the equivalent to what i budget for two weeks of groceries...per person, mind you!\n\ni was in town for a work conference and one of our clients was gracious enough to invite all of his brokers to dinner. \n\ni'm not much of a carnivore but..when in rome! it would be plain dumb of me to choose fish in a place known for their steak. that would be like ordering a hamburger at a chinese restaurant.\n\nhere's the nitty gritty:\n\nstarter: \n<mark>Caesar Salad</mark> (made table side for 2): shared w/ my co-worker. best damn <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> i've ever had! they even mix the dressing fresh.\n\nmain entree:\n<mark>Filet Mignon</mark> - medium rare: i think i died and went to beef heaven. so tender. so perfectly seasoned. so perfectly cooked! i'd be tempted to convert to carnivor-ism if i could eat like this more often.\n\nsides (a la carte):\nwe ordered a bunch for the table to share family style\n<mark>Delmonico Creamed Spinach</mark> - yum-o in my tum-o\nsauteed <mark>Sauted Garlic Mushrooms</mark> - shroomerific\n<mark>Truffle and Parmesan Potato Chips</mark> - the classiest chips on the block & a hit at the table. we fought over the chip with the most truffles.\n\ndessert (again, shared family style):\nbutterscotch pudding - not to sweet - just right but a taste was enough for me.\nchocolate brioche bread pudding - i liked all the layers and it wasn't overly rich \n\nthe service was absolutely impeccable. water glasses were never allowed to go half empty - they were promptly refilled by super observant waiters with bottled water in hand. whenever someone left their chair to use the restroom, they came back to their napkin, neatly refolded and they'll pull your chair out for you to sit.\n\ni've never seen a more professional or attentive group - and that in itself justifies their high prices.\n\ncome here and dine like royalty!", 
            "i'm struggling to figure out why i am rating this four stars instead of five. i guess that five stars is perfection and nothing is perfect, right? \n\nwe (me, wife, and my parents) at here on sunday, august 2, at 7:00. we reserved via opentable and were promptly seated in a very nice location. even though the restaurant was busy the tables on either side of us were kept empty until we were leaving, which was a very nice touch. my wife and i, and my parents, were celebrating our wedding anniversaries, and i noted this with opentable. this was communicated to the restaurant and they treated us very nice. \n\nthe service was extremely good. each table is assigned three people: a head waiter, an assistant waiter, and a buser. all were very polite and professional. the buser was a bit green but that is ok; her mistakes were very minor. the head waiter was exceptional - i don't remember his name and i feel bad for not being able to call him out and recognize him here. the second waiter was also very good; again, i forget her name. \n\nvery good bread was brought to the table and a complimentary appetizer was served to us that consisted of a very yummy chicken salad. my wife and i ordered the table-side <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> and it was worth the $30. the table-side preparation is neat to watch, and she did a great job with it. the entire salad is made from scratch at the table. this caesar goes right to the top of my list as my very favorite caesar and almost makes up for the beat-down i got at the palazzo's craps table right before dinner. my dad ordered a <mark>Creole Boiled Gulf Shrimp Cocktail</mark> that looked excellent. \n\nmy dad and i both had the boneless rib eye and my mom and wife split the filet. it was all good; in fact, i could have used a smaller steak. the waiter said it was 14-16 ounces but this was definitely bigger. for sides we ordered the asparagus, which i don't eat, and the small potatoes with garlic, which were very good. \n\ni had a root beer float for dessert - i liked the fact that there were some old favorites on the dessert menu, including peach cobbler. \n\nwith two bottles of wine (at $65/bottle) we spent over $400 (before tip) on dinner but all agreed that it was money well spent. \n\nabout the only negative is the couple who brought a very small child (6 months?) into the restaurant with them. the baby wasn't doing well and cried somewhat - shame on the parents.", 
            "i wanted to get a nice steak while in vegas.  there were several options in venetian/palazzo alone.  i picked this one because, well, bam!  no but i figured a guy like emeril lagasse would make sure his steakhouse served a nice steak.\n\nthe decor inside is nice and clean, not a whole lot going on.  the opposite of a red robin, say.  service was duly attentive.  <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> prepared table-side was a treat.  \n\nwe went with cocktails over wine from the rather pricey and extensive wine list.  i didn't even eyeball the list personally.  but a generous portion of bombay sapphire satisfied nicely.  \n\ni went with a bone-in new york, medium-rare.  it was cooked expertly.  it had great texture and flavor, a nice creole seasoning rub on there but not too heavily applied.  the beef did the talking.  or the mooing.  it was good.  only ordered one side on account of a late lunch and we're not rich: mushrooms sauteed in butter.  i feared some pain old sauteed buttons would come out.  but i was rewarded.  a hearty mix of flavorful 'shrooms, like oyster and chantrelle and maybe porcini or shiitake came out.  lovely.  and buttery.  and garlicky.",

            "i have been on the lookout for the perfect filet for some time now.  my search has put this place on the top of my list.  after years of waiting i finally  was able to dine at the famed delmonico steakhouse in vegas.  i was promised by steak loving friends that the filet was so perfect you didn't need a knife to cut it.\n\nmy wife and i arrived a bit early so we could check out their bar.  the ambiance while very nice, was not what i had expected.  it was also not very busy which also threw me off a bit.  anyway, we sat at the bar and i ordered up my usual (goose martini with 3 blue cheese olives) and my wife ordered a glass of wine.  we chatted up the friendly bar tender, finished our drinks then headed into the main dining area to be seated.\n\nfirst we were given a ginormous wine list that took us 10 minutes to go through and another 10 minutes to decided what we wanted.  we settled on a very reasonably priced bottle and our waiter was not at all pissed that we didn't drop $100's on a bottle.\n\nfirst they bring you a small dinner roll/bread thing that was very unremarkable.  i liked it that they brought you a single roll so i couldn't eat 4 of them and ruin my dinner, but it just wasn't that good so i really didn't want more than one.  probably for the best though.\n\nfor an appetizer we shared the <mark>Creole Boiled Gulf Shrimp Cocktail</mark> which was excellent.  the shrimp were boiled in some creole stuff which gave them a very nice flavor.  they give you 4 large shrimp which is perfect for sharing although i could have eaten them all myself.  if you like super hot cocktail sauce then be sure to ask for a side of horseradish to heat it up some more.\n\nthen we had the <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> which is prepared tableside and is a 2 person portion.  while the salad was pretty good, i wouldn't order it again.  they add some spices to it that i just don't think belong in a salad and gave it an odd flavor.\n\nas per our steakhouse usual, my wife and i split the filet and we both thought it was excellent.  it wasn't perfect, but probably one of the best i have ever had.  it was cooked perfectly, had excellent flavor and the rub they used wasn't too overpowering.  the steak was very tender but not the cut-with-your-fork kind of tender i am looking for.  at 9oz it was a perfect size to split and not feel overly full after our meal.\n\nfor sides we ordered the veggie of the day (broccoli) and the <mark>Roasted Fingerling Potatoes</mark>.  i guess they were pretty good but i should have ordered a few of their less healthy options like <mark>Delmonico Creamed Spinach</mark> or mashed potatoes.  my wife was in charge of the sides this time but next time i'm ordering something good.\n\nmy wife and i are both suckers for desserts made in house so we had to try their pecan pie.  it was ok but i would try sometime else next time like the cheese cake.  i wasn't a fan of the crust but i was a fan of the size; it wasn't huge and was perfect for 2 people to share.\n\nafter dinner my wife ordered a decaf coffee and for some reason i had absinthe.  the after dinner drink menu caught my eye because it had like 5 different selections of absinthe which is very unique.  i asked if i could do a sampler of them all but they said no.  instead, i settled on one and it was very good.  i am not a very experienced absinthe drinker so i really couldn't tell you if it was any better than any other one but it was quite good......and strong.  i still have no idea why the heck i ordered it.\n\nmy entire delmonico experience was excellent.  our entire waitstaff crew (there had to be 4 people waiting on us) were fast, friendly and helpful.  the price for the steak was reasonable and comparable to other steakhouses, but everything else was pretty high.  anyway, i would definitely dine here again and honestly cannot wait to return.", 
            "before you digest any of my review it is important to say that i travel to vegas on business and i find that with very few exceptions the restaurants, even the nice ones, to be poor imitations of what one would find in a city that hasn't been painted into existence.\n\nnonetheless, the steak i had at delmonico was excellent and the service refreshing by vegas standards.  the table-side <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> preparation makes for good show and equally excellent taste.  it's not the quietest or the most interesting interior design, very basic and elegant if perhaps a bit crowded.  if you want a nicely cooked piece of quality meat only slightly on the spendy side this is a recommended option.", 
            "we started off getting drinks at the bar as we waited for the rest of party to arrive.  let me get this out, i love spago and go there every time to meet my fav. chef, eric klein, and i was not impressed when the bartender starting dissing all the wolfgang puck restos.  i mean, i didn't like cutthat much, but that's a diff review. so we kinda started off on the wrong foot. nonetheless, the drinks were good. my boyfriend's mojito had a real sugar cane in it so i can't complain about that at all.\n\ni shared the 2 person fancy-shmancy made tableside caesars salad and can only say that it tastes exactly like a <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> that would've been made in the kitchen.  i ordered the filet. ate 1/2, passed it my boyfriend so he can finish it.  the wine selection was impressive. the bottle picked out was phenomenal and paired really well my entree.  i would recommend the sauteed mushrooms because everyone ordered a different side dish yet everyone ate my mushrooms so that should tell you something....", 
            "just as good the second time around!  near perfect steak dinner, but not perfect.\n\nthis place is worth a repeat visit.  i really have to compliment the wait staff at this restaurant.  it seemed like there were more workers than patrons the night we were there.  \n\n<mark>Caesar Salad</mark> - i was very tempted to order an appetizer, but my gf reminded me we were about to eat over a pound of meat so we decided to share the <mark>Caesar Salad</mark>.  it was prepared table side by our waiter.  it was decent and a nice way to prepare my stomach for the main course.\n\n<mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark> - mine was cooked perfectly and well seasoned.  my particular cut was very, very tender.  my gf order the exact same steak and it wasn't nearly as good.  i had to share parts of my steak with her and we took the rest of hers to go.  hers wasn't bad, it just wasn't as good as mine.  \n\nsides - we ordered the creamed corn and asparagus.   the corn was very good.  it had a nice crust on the top and went well with my steak.  the asparagus was pretty plain.  i had to throw salt and pepper on it otherwise it was completely tasteless.  \n\ndessert - we ordered the banana cream pie.  i have no idea why we chose it, but i'm glad we did.  i would have usually ordered something chocolaty with ice cream but the banana cream pie sounded good.  well, it was good.  really good.  when it came out, i thought it was going to be way too sweet with all the caramel and chocolate shavings, but it wasn't.  we weren't even hungry after our meal, but we managed to put the entire dessert down.  \n\noverall, the food was good.  i have to give it 4 stars for the boring asparagus and inconsistent steak.  the wait staff was awesome.  they can have 5 stars.", 
            "this was a very noisy but wonderful restaurant.  the steaks are huge and delicious.  perfectly cooked with the spices/butter you want. we had the <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> for 2 and my only complaint was that it could have used more anchovies.  the boneless rib eyes were delicious and huge.  they only marked up the veuve cliquot champagne 3x what i can buy it for at costco, so we splurged for my mother's 80th birthday. the waiters were attentive and we had a wonderful time.  don't go there on a diet.",

            "** 100th review ** \n\ni had been anticipating this lunch for a few days. delmonico has been a favorite of mine but i hadn't dined there for a year. and, i was meeting esteemed london yelper yee gan o., who was on one of his dining and roller coaster trips across america. talking with yee gan was great. in fact, our conversation was so animated that our server asked if we wanted him to remain away, because we were discussing business. i told him that it wasn't business we were discussing, and he was thus welcome to hover over us. but, besides the consistency of the bearnaise sauce, the one complaint i have is that on this outing the waitstaff did not come close to hovering. i had to ask for a second roll, iced tea refills occurred but not too frequently, and an empty butter dish remained empty. this was in sharp contrast to my earlier visits to delmonico where i could barely get a glass down to half full before it was refilled, and when a new roll appeared as soon as an old one disappeared. the restaurant was not very crowded at all, so being too busy could not legitimately account for the laggard service. it wasn't so much our server but our assistant server who fell down on the job. he was responsible for refilling glasses, resupplying rolls, and making sure sufficient butter was available on the table. \n\nnow on to the meal itself! my <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> was very smooth, creamy, and flavorful, with a few morsels of sweet lobster to nibble on as garnish. it was all i hoped for! the <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> that followed was better than i expected. it was very tasty, with very fresh romaine lettuce leaves and long croutons that when broken spread cheesy garlic flavor all over the lettuce, to join with the parmesan splinters that were liberally spread over all. it was an excellent dish! \n\nmy <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> looked forlorn on the plate. only a large pat of maitre d' butter appeared beside it. a little pink blood was also pooled on the plate beneath the meat, which to me was a good sign. the prime grade filet was cooked almost all medium rare to order, but a few spots were closer to medium, and the steak was more peppery than i prefer. otherwise it tasted very good. it could have tasted even better had i not forgotten to order bearnaise sauce until the steak arrived at our table. that was my fault, and it probably contributed to the drama that followed. but the filet on my plate was not a $50 steak, which is what i paid for it. for that price--especially at lunch--i expect the filet to be great. this one was very good but not great. its size was not listed, but it was no more than 8 oz. \n\nour server immediately put in the order for bearnaise sauce, but it did not arrive for several minutes. he then made a point of telling me that the chef makes bearnaise sauce to order, and was preparing a new batch for me. a few minutes later, as i chipped away at more steak without any sauce, still no sauce had appeared. so i ate more of my steak, which was at least still tasty standing on its own. then the bearnaise sauce at last arrived, but it was runny and not very flavorful. it looked like it needed to set longer, so i left it alone for about two minutes, but the consistency remained thin after then. again, my tardiness in ordering the sauce probably caused the chef to rush its preparation, so i take partial responsibility for an imperfect bearnaise on this occasion. let this be a lesson to all diners: order bearnaise sauce when you order your steak--not when it arrives! \n\nas i ate my steak, i looked longingly at yee gan's lobster sliders, which looked delectable. but i'll let him report on that as well as the <mark>Traditional New Orleans Gumbo</mark> that he also ordered, which looked delicious as well, and that i have enjoyed before. but delmonico is first and foremost a steakhouse, and i wanted to review one of its steaks. (however, i may slip in again soon and order lobster sliders on my next lunch outing there.) \n\nmy side of <mark>Country Smashed Potatoes</mark> was a smash hit, with creamy red-skinned potatoes with a little of the skin showing, a few circles of green onion sprinkled on top, and including some very tasty lumps of potato that quickly dissolved in the mouth. i was going to take the remaining uneaten half of this quite large side dish home, it tasted so good--but forgot to do so, for which i am still kicking myself. for dessert, yee gan and i split a generous slice of emeril's renowned banana cream pie, which was top-heavy with whipped cream, filled with luscious pieces of banana, and also bedecked with chocolate shavings and caramel sauce. as i savored each bite, i tried to conjure up how to best describe the taste of this concoction, and one word stood out: \"heavenly.\" the only comparable banana cream pie i have eaten is the last one i had at delmonico. and, this one was better by a shaving. \n\noverall, a very good lunch with great company!", 
            "you know the expression about sailors having a woman in every port. well, on my recent trip to the usa, i had yelpers in every town to host, entertain and amuse!\n\nvegas elite dennis t was my lunch companion when i was in town. not only was he gracious enough to clear some time in his busy schedule to have lunch with me but i was honoured that he made our meal together his 100th review\n\ndennis gave me a list of tempting options for lunch. i had to watch how much i was going to have for lunch as i had a dinner reservation at raku that evening for the kaiseki menu but the lobster sliders at delmonico caught my eye, so that was my choice.\n\ni had a nice time wandering through the venetian on my way to delmonico. the size and scale of u.s. buildings in general amaze me but the venetian is certainly very ornate and i enjoyed looking at the menus while walking down restaurant row on the way to delmonico\n\ni instantly recognised dennis from his yelp picture and like all the yelpers i've met, conversation flowed like we were old friends. so much so that unusually for yelpers, we were chatting so much that ordering took awhile as we hadn't look at the menu the first few times that our waiter approached to take our order\n\nthe restaurant is certainly decked out to appeal to the higher end of customer. it was a quiet lunch service when we dined and while it provided a good ambiance for chatting, i perhaps didn't see delmonico as the busy celebrity chef steakhouse that it is.\n\ni had already decided on my main course of lobster sliders and using my personal rule of taking the opportunity of eating foods that i don't come across often, i paired that with an appetiser of <mark>Traditional New Orleans Gumbo</mark>. i'm not in any position to comment on the authenticity of the gumbo but as emeril lagasse started his celebrated celebrity chef trail with his first restaurant emeril's in new orleans, i'm guessing he can cook a good gumbo. mine was certainly pungent with a great depth of flavour from a carefully stock. being asian, i was also impressed to see that the rice had been cooked well\n\ndennis was pleased with his appetiser of <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> followed by <mark>Caesar Salad</mark>\n\nit may seem odd to eschew steak at a steakhouse. however, i've always liked the sound of lobster roll but still haven't tried one yet. i saw these lobster sliders as the nearest i could get until i make my trip to the northeast to try a real lobster roll. well, the sliders were excellent - soft rolls containing morsels of sweet lobster meat mixed with the right amount of mayonnaise and seafood dressing.\n\ndennis however wasn't quite as lucky with his fillet steak, which arrived looking rather lonely on the plate. dennis decided to order some bearnaise to correct this loneliness but it took a long time to appear and when it did, it seemed a bit watery.\n\nin an effort to not be too piggy, dennis and i split the banana cream pie. well, the combination of banana, pie, whipped cream, caramel and chocolate shavings pleased my palate probably more than my arteries! i don't have a really sweet tooth but i really enjoyed this\n\ndennis was kind enough to give a lift back to my hotel down the strip, which gave me a good touristy view of the sights\n\na friendship sealed. a celebrity chef ticked off. lobster sliders consumed. a most successful lunch rendezvous indeed!", 
            "the best steak i ever had in vegas!! i have been here three times and they have never disappointed. every steak i have had has been perfectly cooked and seasoned. <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> was perfect and the sides were tasty as well. service is always friendly and ambiance is nice. with many choices, emeril never seems to disappoint  and i'm truly a fan.", 
            "first time here and i will be back!\n\ni made reservations a week before on their website and asked for a nice table.\n\nmy party of 4 arrived early, but no problem- they had our table ready for us!\n\nwe ordered a bottle of cabernet sauvignon ($65) and had the following:\n\ni ordered two appetizers for my entree:\n1. <mark>Vine-Ripened Heirloom Tomato Salad</mark> with burrata cheese, red onion, extra\nvirgin olive oil, balsamic vinegar and torn local basil.\n- i was a little sad that the burrata cheese was so small compared to the heirloom tomatoes, but it was delicious!\n\n2. <mark>Butternut Squash Ravioli</mark> with sage brown butter, toasted hazelnuts and parmesan\n- omg!  so good!  the squash was divine.  i would definitely order this again.\n\n3. grilled marinated organic <mark>Herb Marinated Chicken Breast</mark> - <mark>Roasted Fingerling Potatoes</mark>, whole\ngarlic, wild mushrooms and natural reduction\n- the person that ate this said that the chicken was cooked perfectly and had really good flavor.\n\n4. <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> w/ a twice <mark>Baked Idaho Potato</mark> (with bacon and vermont cheddar) and a <mark>Caesar Salad</mark>.\n- he said that the steak melted in his mouth!\n\n5. surf & turf- bone in ribeye and crab & <mark>Buttered Fresh Asparagus</mark>, i believe. (i don't see it on the menu, so it must be a special)\n- my husband cleaned his plate.\n\nwe also ordered two desserts:\n1. delmonico chocolate layer cake - chocolate pudding, coconut ice cream and\ntoasted almonds\n- looked delicious.  they said it was good and the coconut ice cream was amazing!\n\n2. pecan pie with oatmeal shortbread crust french, vanilla ice cream & caramel sauce\n- pie was in the shape of a circle, so the center was ooey and gooey and yummy!!  very good!\n\nprice was about $300+ for the table (not including tip).\n\nthe service was outstanding!  we actually had 3 people waiting on us and never had to ask for anything.  they were on-point with re-filling the water at the table!  it was so nice to never have to look around for someone to help us.  the timing of everything was beautiful.\n\nwe even got an amuse-bouche bruschetta when we were deciding what to have for dinner.  what a nice surprise!!", 
            "the first time i went to this restaurant was in 2002, and i remember it like it was yesterday. it is in the top three meals of my life. after almost 10 years i can still remember the flavors of the table-made <mark>Caesar Salad</mark>, the angel hair pasta with smoky mushrooms & tasso, and the perfect <mark>Filet Mignon</mark>. joe and i were dating at the time, now married, and we still talk about that dinner, and went to re-live it a couple years ago to be amazed again.", 
            "we came for the ribeye! you should too!\n\nwe'd heard the accolades about the <mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark> at delmonico's and decided to see for ourselves. of the eight in our group - seven of us ordered the <mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark> - the eighth ordered a filet.  bottom line - everyone was pleased.\n\nthe cuts were ample.\nthe cooking-temperatures perfect.\nthe flavor excellent.\nthe texture exceptionally tender.\n\nof note also, was the table-side <mark>Caesar Salad</mark>. for sides we kept it simple - ordering fries and mushrooms - both were excellent. another winner was the banana cream pie.\n\nservice overall was accommodating and highly attentive. \n\nthe room itself is a little bland - and the lighting system rather ugly - but hey - you're here for the steak!\n\nrecommended!", 
            "i stumbled into delmonico steakhouse after going to the wrong place as suggested by my friend. he told me to go to emeril's in vegas, so i did. however, the only place that houses emeril's name is the fish house.\n\nmy friend challenged me that demonico had the best <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> after i claimed i had found the holy grail. so i had to try it here. first off, they make it from scratch, tableside here. they even have you inspect it before putting salad in.\n\npreviously i thought i had good <mark>Caesar Salad</mark>, but this was on a different level. the salads that i've had before were either good or bad. the flavor was just that. however this salad actually had *waves* of flavor. you could distinctly taste the pepper fade in and out, the egg fade in and out, sardines fade in and out, and other flavors until it mellowed out on your palette. wtf, are you serious? i didn't even know salad dressing could do that. i give the salad a 5/5\n\nmy lady and i shared the lamb. i am not a huge lamb eater because i generally find it too fatty and i don't like fatty texture. this was good though and i did enjoy it all. it could have been a little more charred on the outside as i found that part to be the most tasty. i probably would have been better off with something a little more traditional like steak, i suppose. i'll give them lamb a 4/5\n\nfor dessert i got this cheesecake that was akin to a smore. it was seriously yum. i was stuffed before i started it, and i still ate it - it was that good. i will give it a 5/5.\n\nwhat was magnificent with this place was the service. i am very particular with service and how often the service visits your table. i was a little scared at first of this place when they announced that we would be attended by three different people. of crap i thought, they are going to be down my throat every bite. but really, they worked it like a charm. they came when they needed to and didn't come when they didn't need to come - all three of them. my water was constantly full as well. i really appreciated this.\n\ni want to go back here next time i am in town and do a few things differently. first, don't eat 3 hours before arriving. i was not all that hungry when i arrived and i felt like i was doing myself a disservice. second, try something more to my liking such as chicken or steak. i have to give it a 4.5 but yelp doesn't allow a half mark. i feel that the main part of the meal was the weakest which is the main reason you are there so i am rounding down to 4-stars. maybe if i enjoyed the main course a little more (not that it was bad) then i would have given it a straight 5-stars.\n\ni'll be back.", 
            "i had dinner here on 2/7.  the last time i was here was over 10 years ago.  the last vegas steakhouse that i had eaten at was cut, so that is what i will be comparing my experience to.\nservice:  very good.  we had at least 3-4 servers taking care of us (party of 5) throughout the night.  initially dinner was for a party of 4.  however, once we were seated, our buddy landed at the airport and decided to join us.  i informed the head server (thinking that they may not be able to accommodate) and he immediately converted the table to seat 5 (pulled out stuff from the bottom to make it a round table).  water was constantly filled and table cleared off in appropriate fashion.\nfood:  we started off with the <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> and <mark>Ahi Tuna</mark>/<mark><mark>Ahi Tuna</mark> and Salmon Tartare</mark>.  i thought the salad was just ok.  a tad too much dressing.  same with the tartare.  nothing special and pretty bland.  most of the group got the bone in rib eye (medium rare to medium well).  all were cooked well.  i thought the medium rare tasty pretty good.  nothing spectacular about it, just good steak.  i had the <mark>Colorado Rack of Lamb</mark> (medium rare) and it had decent flavors.  i would take carvino's lamb chops over it any day.  the sides we had were decent (<mark>Potato Gratin</mark>, mushrooms, and corn).  we had a nice bottle of wine that the sommelier recommended with a price point of $85.  that was probably the best tasting thing of the night.\nthe verdict on delmonico's is that it is a decent steakhouse that it's reputation is based on its name more than its food.  i would choose cut over it any day.  they have more selection of meat (cuts and quality).", 
            "i think i may have set my expectations too high. i went for lunch, which was pretty nice since there were only about 4 of us total in the restaurant. the service was good, and the staff is extremely attentive (again, only 4 people in the restaurant). my <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> was a bit bland. i wasn't in love with the long leaf of romaine that they pour the dressing over and make you cut in order to eat. \nthe burger sans bacon was amazing. they didn't ask me how i'd like it cooked though which again bothered me. i normally would get mine a bit more done than medium rare. the dessert i opted to try was the banana creme pie. it was amazing. the display itself is jaw dropping! i enjoyed the pie immensely and bagged the rest for later in the evening. i couldn't possibly eat it all right then and there. \n\nambiance - 4 stars\nstaff - 4 stars\nfood - 3.5 stars (bland <mark>Caesar Salad</mark>; could have been better had they asked me how i'd like by burger prepared)", 
            "tl;dr - you can do much much better.  \n\ni was actually kind of shocked by this place.  i had heard good things, but was disappointed at virtually every turn:\n\nappearance - the place is falling apart.  tiles falling out of walls, holes in walls, dirty bathrooms, uncomfortable and awkward seating.\n\nservice - mediocre.  had to ask repeatedly for items, waiter disappeared for 20+ minutes at a time.  \n\nfood - decent; worthy of a 3 star, but the rest drags the rating down.  my filet was cooked to order and seasoned well.  when i ask for anchovies for my <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> though, i don't mean 'the anchovy paste you use in the dressing is adequate.'  it means i would like actual anchovies.  this isn't rocket surgery, delmonico.\n\nall in all, anywhere else this would have rated a 3 star experience, but given both the price (in general, and relative to other steakhouses in vegas), and the sheer overabundance of steakhouses per capita in lv, there's no way this should rate highly on anyone's list.   bad form, delmonico.", 
            "hello!!?!?! this place was so good. we had the table side <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> which was delicious of course and i had the <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> and boyfriend had a big bone in rib eye. we had scalloped potatoes as our side and everything was truly amazing. our server said jay-z and beyonce were there about one month prior which made us feel like our choice of eating here was a good one. we went to celebrate my boyfriend's birthday and i let them know that when i made reservations. they did a great job of making sure everyone that encountered our table knew that which was nice- made us feel really valued. a really beautiful steak dinner and they did an excellent job of making our special occasion extra special. so good!!! steak was cooked to perfection and the cajun rub that they put on it was really a nice touch. can't hate anything with a large pat of butter on top either- of course it was everything i had hoped this filet would be and more. the crispy outside of the cajun spices was really a nice addition of course an emril style thing you'd hope for. yum!", 
            "went here for lunch while in las vegas on june 4, 2013.  fabulous service, definitely a first class place.  my girlfriend and i started with the <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> which was just wonderful, great flavor and presentation.  we then both went with the steak sandwich with truffle oil fries.  the steak sandwich though not huge was extremely delicious and i mean extremely delicious.  everything that went into it was perfect, the spinach, the mushrooms, the grilled chibata, the horseradish mayo, and the wonderful juicy perfectly cooked steak.  it is a bit pricey at $18, but definitely worth the price in my opinion.  the fries weren't anything special and were a bit over cooked.  the setting was nice, but the restaurant was empty and all the guests dining were confined to the front dining room.  overall great meal, and i will be a repeat customer when back in town.", 
            "typical day in vegas couldn't decide where to eat (too many choices). decided to go to delmonico steakhouse in the venetian. service was pretty prompt as usual with this place. we ordered the <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> that was prepared table side, i believe i ordered a  bone in rib-eye and my girlfriend ordered the salmon. all of the food was prepared well and service was perfection. i would definitely recommend this restaurant to my friends and family.", 
            "steak! my first trip to vegas was this past summer with a group of friends. we ate here one night and it's the best steak i have every had in my life. i started with the <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> and for dinner had the boneless ribeye medium rare with a bunch of different sides for the table, no room for desert though. also two of my friends ordered the <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> which they make table side (for two people).  \n\n<mark>Lobster Bisque</mark>... very very tasty and rich. if you don't like rich foods then you should not order this. it also has nice size chunks of lobster in it. \n\nboneless ribeye, medium rare...amazing. it was cooked to perfection, just the way medium rare should be. it was well cooked and well seasoned, there's no need to dip it in ketchup or steak sauce. it was a pretty decent size cut of meat too, i can't remember the ounces but i left stuffed. \n\n<mark>Caesar Salad</mark>...i'm not a fan of rabbit food but watching the person make it table side it looked really good. in a matter of about 5-8 minutes he made two servings of what i was told was the best <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> ever,\n\nat this restaurant, the steak doesn't come with anything, you have to order the sides separately, i think we ordered asparagus, wild sauteed wild mushrooms and twice <mark>Baked Idaho Potato</mark>. all was cooked to perfection. \n\nthe service...it was the outstanding. there are three people per table, so you are always attended to and the waiter is well versed in the menu and the drinks. i wasn't too sure what i wanted so i asked him for a recommendation and he asked me a few questions and based on those answers brought a drink out, which was good. i can't remember the name but it was good. i think it had 3 different kinds of liquor in it but it didn't taste like it at all, not overwhelming, good blend, good bartender. \n\nit is expensive but well worth the money. the food, the service, the atmosphere and best of all since it is vegas no need to really dress up, my kind of place. definitely have to go there again when i go back during christmas.", 
            "i was able to sample many menu items on my first and only visit to delmonico's to date.   the things i loved were the parmesan chip appetizer, the <mark>Caesar Salad</mark>, the soft shell crab and the bbq shrimp app.  the <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> was probably the best i've ever had.  the chips were thin cut and perfectly crispy.  the bbq shrimps were cooked just right and the bbq sauce was mild and great for the shrimp.  the crab was excellent - perfectly cooked and had great flavor. i also tried the ny strip, it was cooked correctly and had a nice crust.  it was not the best steak i've ever had, but you can tell it was done with care and quality.  the appetizers were very good because each one had something that made it special...i would like to see that with the steaks as well.  i would say the service is what i was most disappointed in.  not that it was bad, but it just wasn't what you expect from a place of this caliber (and price).", 
            "great meal!  went for lunch and had the <mark>Truffle and Parmesan Potato Chips</mark>, <mark>Caesar Salad</mark>, lobster sliders, filet medallions and prime burger.  topped it off with the pecan pie (spectacular) and peppermint chocolate layer cake.  service was outstanding as well - what a great group from start to finish.  and thanks so much for the surprise pop-overs in our to-go bag!", 
            "this is probably one of my favorite places for steak, bread pudding, or when i wanna eat at the bar alone. here is a summary of one of my experiences that i shared with one of my foodie friends when we ate here. \n\nwe ordered the <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> which was spectacularly prepared fresh able side by the maitre 'd. it was like $30 but probably the best salad of my life! next was the bone in rib eye which was so perfectly seasoned and cooked! i'm a huge fan of sides so i got the <mark>Delmonico Creamed Spinach</mark>, a <mark>Baked Idaho Potato</mark>, creamed corn, and asparagus. yes, there were amazing left overs!\n\nfor dessert of course it was the white chocolate macadamia nut bread pudding! if anyone knows emril's shows or books you know this is like his signature item. i have also had the duck egg creme brulee which is heavenly as well. but my go to is the bread pudding!\n\nthis is a place you probably wouldn't wanna eat at daily, but it is a place to take special friends who enjoy good food at it's best or for an awesome night of self spoiling! :)\n\n*lobster bique, the <mark>Butternut Squash Ravioli</mark> and the fried chicken are killer too!", 
            "had dinner reservations at 6:30pm and we were seated right away.\n\ni looked at their menu prior to stepping foot into the restaurant so i kind of had an idea of what i would like to order.\n\nfor our appetizer, we ordered two parmesan and garlic <mark>Truffle and Parmesan Potato Chips</mark>. i'm a chip queen....obsessed and in love with chips but this....this didn't taste that great. =/ the first five chips were good...but after awhile...it tasted way too greasy. you know that over greased taste? yeah...that's what i was starting to taste. it felt like they drenched the entire thing in oil and left it there for days. my party finished the first plate of that but we just couldn't finish the second plate. i definitely would not order this again. \n\n<mark>Traditional New Orleans Gumbo</mark>: this gumbo had rice, chicken, sausage and veggies. pretty good sized portion for a bowl of soup. small eaters would be half full from this. seriously...lol. i thought to myself...damn...i hope i have enough room in my stomach for my entree!!!\n\n<mark>Caesar Salad</mark>: typical normal caesar. it's big enough to share with your entire party.\n\nboneless rib-eye: you have your choice on the menu for bone-in or boneless rib eye. i was with a fancy date and his party of four other high rollers so i didn't wanna make a mess, that's why i opted for boneless. i've got to admit...it was good...but to be technical, i would rate it at a solid b grade. my rib eye was cooked to my liking, the flavoring was delicious but......there were more fatty parts that i would like. =/ eh...not a big fan. but it didn't take away from the complete meal. great rib eye...big enough for leftovers the next day.\n\nnote: three out of the six steak entrees my party ordered was over cooked. someone wanted medium rare but her steak came out medium. my date ordered medium and it pretty much came out medium well.\n\nfor our side dishes we ordered potatoes au gratin, asparagus, mashed potatoes, and another veggie dish.\n\ncan't go wrong with delmonicos. def give it a try! be sure to make reservations.", 
            "my boyfriend and i dined at delmonico's on a trip to vegas  in july 2013 - for dinner on the 4th of july.  the restaurant we had originally planned to go to that night was completely booked, so based on the great yelp rating we chose delmonico's instead.  \n\nprior to our trip, we were so excited to try this place out.  our reservations were at 8pm and we showed up a few minutes early, expecting the place to be packed.  i should mention that the location is very odd and not easy to find.  however, once we found it we started wondering if we were  in the right place...  both of us have dined in nice steakhouses many times and expected that familiar 5 star experience.  from the second we walked in the door it was clear that delmonico's was not that kind of place.\n\nthe entrance was very dark - no one was at the hostess stand and the bar/lounge area was completely empty.  the restaurant looked closed.   then, the hostess showed up with another employee - they finished their casual, not work related, conversation before greeting us.  they looked up our reservation and sat us right away so i was ready to let go of my first impression and enjoy a great meal.  unfortunately, that was just the start.  \n\nthe hostess led us into a mostly empty room with very dim lighting.  we thought it was weird but went along with it.  as we sat down, we realized that the only other table in the room was a large party with serval children - who were playing games and watching movies on their ipads! we were shocked that this behavior was allowed in such a place.  we looked into the other dining room which was mostly full and seemed very lively, full of adults.  when our waiter came over we asked to move to that room (pointing out the distractions at the other table), which they accommodated.\n\nfinally in the environment we were hoping for, we felt relieved as our new waiter handed us a wine list.  the waiter brought the wine and as he poured the glasses, he spilled an entire glass in front of me, on the table.  did he find us a new table? did he bring a new (full) bottle of wine? no. instead he picked the glass up and continued pouring and brought a white napkin to place in front of me to cover the wine stained/wet area.\n\nat this point, we considered leaving but it was past 8:30 and we wanted to try the steak, so we stayed.  we ordered the table side <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> and the chateaubriand to split.  the salad was the highlight of the meal - if you go here, make sure to order it.  the steak was ok, slightly undercooked and we have definitely had better.  after the meal, we decided to skip desert here and go upstairs to otto instead.\n\ni did use the restroom during the meal.  this was another disappointment.  the restrooms are located down a long hallway, which was also where they stored the extra chairs (stacks of them).  you felt like you were in an area of the restaurant that shouldn't be customer facing - cluttered, scuffs all over the walls and baseboards. \n\noverall, the experience at delmonico's was anything but 5 star.  with so many wonderful restaurants in vegas at this price point, there is no reason to choose delmonico's.", 
            "i had the pleasure of dining at this restaurant while i was visiting vegas with my fiance. we were staying at the venetian and this location is conveniently located within the beautiful hotel so it was an easy choice for dinner. it is definitely nice not having to step outside of the ac when the average temperature outside is 115! \n\ni got the <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> to start and <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> for the main dish. some of the side items we got were spinach, asparagus, wild mushrooms, and <mark>Creamed Corn Gratine</mark>. the main dishes do not come with sides so they are extra but the portions are large enough to share. \n\ni asked for my <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> to be medium rare and it was done perfectly. the steak was so tender and delicious! it was definitely one of the best steaks i have had. the sides complimented the meat nicely and everything single one of them were delicious. i wish i could comment on their deserts but we were both so full by the end of the meal that we decided to skip desert. this restaurant is a must if you are in vegas!", 
            "i would recommend this to anyone that's in vegas and wants a good steak. the bone in ribeye was certainly amazing, along with appetizers. and i think the price is very reasonable. \n\nif i have to complain about anything is that i didn't like the <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> cuz it was drenched in dressing. but everything else was super yummy. \n\nhere is what we ordered:\ntuna and salmon tartar: omg so good. combined with the crispy chips, i could order two of it for an entry next time. \n\nfresh oysters: tasted very fresh\n\nbbq shrimp: got it despite yelp reviews say not to. thought it was pretty good. nice bbq sauce. \n\n<mark>Lobster Bisque</mark>: good but too salty. tasted better with bread. there were big chunks of lobsters though. \n\n<mark>Caesar Salad</mark>: it was made table side. nothing spectacular, and way too much dressing. \n\nbone in rib eye: amazing\n\n<mark>Bone-In New York Strip</mark>: pretty good but wasn't as good as the rib eye. \n\nsalmon: forgot the exact name but it was very good. it had like gumbo style things on the bottom which made it interesting. \n\ngarlic mushroom side: good \n\ngarlic mash potatoes: just goes so well with the rib eye.", 
            "ate there back in april.  man what a great place. my friend and i had the ny strip with the twice bake potato and <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> was good.  plan on trying a steak house over at caesars palache's in january but may be heading back to delmonicos as well.", 
            "delmonico serves up superb cuts of meat!  i'd recommend going with the <mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark>... so tender, juicy, and flavorful!  and don't skimp on the sides, order at least 2-3 even if it's just for a party of 2.  i loved the <mark>Caesar Salad</mark>.  there's something nice about slicing your own leaves of romaine in a salad.\n\nthe service here is nice and efficient.  it's what you would expect when dining at a restaurant of this calibre.", 
            "celebrated labor day weekend in vegas and was looking for a good steakhouse. this place was high quality and great service. i ordered the salmon but substituted the potato and andouille sausage hash for mashed potatoes since i don't eat red meat or pork, and held off of the homemade worcestershire sauce. the onion rings on the top were delicious, i could have eaten a plate of them! my boyfriend got the bone in rib eye and my friends ordered the <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> for two (kinda pricey ~$34 - but good) and a steak and salmon. this will be one of my top restaurants i'll be going to when i go back to vegas.", 
            "we love this place.  we dined here on march 5, 2015.  it holds a special place in our hearts.  we started with the <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> for two which was prepared table side, so fresh and good.  the steaks are always better than we remember.  we had the bone in <mark>Ribeye</mark> medium rare and they melted in our mouths.  the desserts are always fantastic too.  we went here on our yearly vegas trip which we do for our half anniversary every year.  can not say enough about this restaurant!  love love.  there was one not so great side dish and it seemed like it was only ours....the potato au gratin was burnt and dry, not a good combo and we should have sent it back.  everyone else's that went by our table looked fantastic.  our bad, we should have sent it back....but o well...just don't order that dish.  we had a great evening and the service was excellent as always.", 
            "the food is outstanding. the service is amazing. the <mark>Truffle and Parmesan Potato Chips</mark> are to die for. their <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> is incomparable. steak and shrimp is great as well.", 
            "this is one of the most amazing restaurant i've ever had. i made a reservation for fourth of july for my boyfriend's birthday. the service was 5 stars, my water was never below one sip level. we had three servers for our table. i've been waiting for their bone in ribeye as review said it was good. it was better than i expected. we had two appetizers beef cappacio and table side  <mark>Caesar Salad</mark>, halibut, delicious! and caramel cake dessert was perfect. the servers had also given us a birthday banana walnut ice cream. highly recommend this place!", 
            "i celebrated christmas here with my family in 2014. my grandfather had cancer and wanted an authentic <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> since his appetite was back and he felt better. the service was  outstanding and so was the food. my sister and i had to split a t-bone steak because it was so big. we devoured it in about 3 minutes because it just melted. it was seasoned perfectly and the side orders we picked came in generous portions (we had to take them home).  my grandfather loved the salad he kept saying it was exactly what he was craving. it was the first time i'd eaten a correctly made caesar and it was extremely well flavored. everyone was so stuffed and we had tons of food left over. as i stated before the service was outstanding i day this because my grandfather started feeling pain and needed to be taken home to have his medication immediately. they let half of us leave to escort him to our ride and we hadn't even paid or bill. they discreetly packed up or food and took our payment after they were sure his situation was handled, they even offered to have security bring a wheel chair and escort us out the venetian. that was the last christmas meal i will ever share with him because he recently passed away but thanks to the understanding, kindness, and professionalism of the staff i will forever have a beautiful memory."

            "i have to say, as much beef as is eaten in vegas i am surprised cows aren't extinct yet...there are steakhouses everywhere of varying quality. i really dug this one. the <mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark> was just about the best steak i have had in this town, the waiter's wine recommendation was spot-on, and the service was impeccable. \n\none thing i noticed, and this separates the good from the great. no service person approached us when we were chewing. that's the worst, being asked a question when your mouth is full. i'd think it was a coincidence, but i saw the manager walking toward us just as i took a bite, and he obviously diverted to another table...a minute later he stopped by and asked us how everything was. that's cool.", 
            "i seem to have really good luck with emeril's restaurants. after my recent visit to delmonico's, i'm beginning to think he can't go wrong. from the moment we walked in the door, it was just instantly different from all the other restaurants we visited. we were greeted warmly, seated immediately even though we were early, and had friendly, attentive service the entire time. \n\nthe atmosphere inside delmonico's is not at all what i would have expected, but it is simple and lovely. the colors are warm, the lighting is excellent (especially at a steakhouse, i need to be able to see my food!), and the decor is plain and easy on the eyes (not a lot of decoration at all).\n\nwe started with some <mark>Truffle and Parmesan Potato Chips</mark> and a <mark>Vine-Ripened Heirloom Tomato Salad</mark> to share while we were getting settled. vince curled up with the wine list with a big, giant grin on his face. ah, so many choices to go with steak, but we can't really go wrong with chambolle musigny, so there you go, and we threw in a bottle of sancerre to start. \n\ni ended up getting emeril's famous <mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark>, vince got the filet, and phil and alexandra got bbq shrimp and mushroom medallions. we also got an assortment of sides, including spinach, asparagus, mushrooms, and garlic <mark>Country Smashed Potatoes</mark>. for someone who likes pure, unadulterated meat, my ribeye was about as perfect as you can get. cooked to my desired rare plus bloodiness, with a simple crust of emeril's essence, a beautiful quality cut without any tendons or gristle, just beautiful meatiness. vince's filet was similarly perfect, nice and thick and bloody, with a delicious cajun rub that enhanced the meat without overpowering it. i was impressed with alexandra's medallions - they were pretty large for medallions; they looked like big 4 oz filets in their own right. i'd had the shrimp before at emeril's seafood restaurant so that was nothing new but those were also good. the spinach actually tasted like spinach (rather than cream), and the asparagus was nice and al dente. \n\ni finished up with some pecan pie, a generous jamaica blue mountain espresso (i was impressed that the coffee list provided a wide variety of espressos from which to choose), and a cognac. too bad it was only lunch! this meal was certainly the highlight of our trip (in addition to being the best, it was also the least expensive). afterwards our server took us on a tour of the restaurant. next time we are definitely going to try to reserve the chef's table. i already can't wait!", 
            "i took my wife here for her birthday this weekend.  lemme say, the service does not get any better than at this place.  our drinks never stayed empty, and our napkins were always quick to be folded by staff whenever we left the table.  \n\nmy wife's bone-in filet just melted in your mouth.  my <mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark> steak was cooked to perfection, and was super tender.  \n\nthe food was out of this world great!!!   true, you're paying an arm and a leg for it, but i felt like i got my money's worth.  i'm definitely returning when i visit vegas.", 
            "i often refer to myself as queen cathy. obnoxious, i know. but it's a nickname that's stuck since high school, and if that's what the people will, that's what i will be.\n\nbefitting the high standards and quality that this queen has come to expect over the years, las vegas never fails to provide the top-notch everything to entertain queen cathy's every whim and desire.\n\ndelmonico's. if i were the president of the us, i'd give you a purple heart. if i were the queen of england, i'd grant you knighthood.  as the queen of cathyland, however, i will give you the highest honor i can bestow: five stars on yelp.\n\nomfg this place is fantastic.  i'm a steakhouse junkie, and i am always looking for the next, even-better steakhouse experience.  my first visit to delmonico's left me speechless, and all subsequent experiences have left me a raving addict.  no kidding.  if i ruled over las vegas, the land would see a very fat queen.\n\nthe service is impeccable.  i don't know how many people work here, but i've never seen my water glass less than half full (talk about food service taking a positive outlook on life! haha).  it's like magic.  before you even have a chance to think it, it happens on its own.  the food in an of itself is delectable.  i only order the boneless ribeye, as it's my absolute favorite cut (and i think the <mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark> is their specialty).  it's flavorful, perfectly seasoned, and absolutely perfectly cooked.\n\nyou see, this queen is picky.  she doesn't like to eat anything bloody. it's gross to her.  so she always always gets her steaks well-done. while some may gasp in horror (how can you enjoy a steak well done?!), i say this, \"it is true that well-done steaks tend to be dry and flat in flavor. if a steakhouse can manage to make my well-done steak juicy and flavorful, then for sure it's a fantastic place!\"\n\ni don't remember much about any of the sides because i'm always too busy gobbling up my steak (and still having leftovers to go!).  many a late las vegas night, i'd drunkenly stumble back into my hotel room, and suddenly overcome by an urge to grub, grab my takeout box and just chew on a slab of leftover steak.  it's even good cold.\n\ndelmonico's, the queen of cathyland salutes you for outstanding service and incredible food. cheers.", 
            "delmonico's is a great place to dine while staying in vegas (especially if you are staying at the venetian).  \n\nservice:\nthe distinguishing characteristic here is the service.  we had 10:00pm reservation on valentine's day and were flying in to vegas to meet friends for a weekend getaway (got that? good).  our flight out of sfo was delayed and we ended up arriving at the restaraunt at 10:48, long after we should have been seated etc.  our waitress was the essence of efficiency; without missing a beat she let us know that last orders were due at 11:00.  they key here was she always made us feel like she was on \"our team\" rather than making us feel as if our lateness at created an inconvienience for her.  she helped all six of us get seated and get our orders in \"before the bell\" (as it were).  she got a $100+ tip for being a pro.\n\nfood:\nthis is a steakhouse, order a steak.  mine was flavorful without being fatty or gristly, pink without being bloody and just the right amount charred on the outside.  this was the ribeye steak, but the <mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark> ordered by one of my partners in crime was equally well-prepared and duly appreciated.  my wife thought her crab-stuffed halibut (wrapped in a potato skin) was good (but not great?).  \n\ncost:\nyou won't find an entree for under $50 and the sides are extra (we had a group of 6 so that actually worked out wonderfully and we ended up dining quasi-family-style).  the asparagus and mushrooms were hits!  with tip (21%), the bill came to exactly $100/person.  i think we all had at least one drink and the girls split a bottle of wine, one desert and a few coffees were ordered.\n\nbottom line:\nthe service here was friendly and professional.  the staff make you feel welcome and are eager to please.  the food is extremely good and a decent value (it is vegas after all).  go here if you like steak and are willing to pay a little extra.", 
            "my experience at delmonico steakhouse was well-above average, but not as fantastic as i thought it would be.  first off, although we had made reservations well in advance, we had to wait over 20 minutes for our table.  all was not completely lost, however, since we passed the time in delmonico's classy little, modish bar area where we got started on our red wine for the evening. \n\nthere was a bit of confusion amongst the servers shortly after we were seated, and we experienced a delay in receiving our selection of bottled waters for our table.  at delmonico, they give you the option of choosing from a few types of bottled and mineral waters for an additional charge, or you can request just regular,complimentary tap water. after the initial delay, our water glasses were refilled continuously throughout the meal, however. \n\nlike most five star restaurants, at delmonico steakhouse, you receive service from several members of the waitstaff, which ensures constant attention and most of your dining needs are met without even having to request anything.\n\nthe interior of the steakhouse was minimalist, with tables covered in cream colored linens and simple, modern brown leather chairs for seating. the space had a slightly mediterranean feel due to its coved ceilings.  no doubt because the restaurant is located inside the venetian hotel, they wanted to maintain a slightly italian theme througout. \n\nthe restaurant, which was was packed with patrons, was also very loud.  i think the coved ceilings were extremely conducive to the noise level contained in the dining room.  this combined with brighter than desired lighting, created a slightly less intimate dining experience than were were anticipating.  \n\nthe food was very good, however.  we started with the crabcake, and it was tender, buttery and delicious.  followed by that, were our iceberg wedge salads with bacon, blue cheese and all the yummies.  hubby ordered the <mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark>, and i ordered the bone-in ny strip, both were cooked to medium perfection.  for sides, we shared a huge, delicious <mark>Baked Idaho Potato</mark> with sour cream, bacon, green onions and cheddar. for dessert, we shared the caramel creme brulee, and it was very, very good.\n\noverall, we enjoyed our meal very much, and we would return here again for the food.  our experience was just was not over-the-top fabulous because of the noise and lighting factors.",

            "7 girls, after a long 4 hour drive, arrived at the venetian on a mission for some hearty steak.  delmonico was the answer to our problem.  we were so exhausted that we didn't even bother pretty-ing ourselves up before hand...dumped out bags and headed straight to dinner.  we were worried that our shorts and flip-flop attire wasn't going to cut it but aside from some dirty stares from some of the other guests, the wait staff kindly turned their heads.  \n\nthe service was impeccable.   they started us off with a goat cheese puff pastry to cleanse our pallets, compliments of the chef.  all of us buddied up and ordered the <mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark> steak...which was plenty to go around.  tasty, it sure was but i'd have to say, i've had better.  the <mark>Sauted Garlic Mushrooms</mark>, creamed corn, cheddar bacon grits, and sauteed asparagus sides were great compliments set in the middle of the table for all of us to share.  we were seated at a circular table which was ideal for conversation instead of screaming across a long table.  by dessert, we were stuffed...next time for sure.  \n\nsince we didn't order any wine to compliment the dinners that we all split, delmonico left the robbing of our $$ to the casinos.  i know if i went with just my boyfriend, it'd be one less night we could stay at the venetian.",

            "about 2 years ago, i had dreamed of eating steak at delmonico's.  the reputation of this place exceeds my expectations; and, as such, is my dilemma with this place.  delmonico's is emeril lagasse's steak house.  it is his prime choice, so-to-speak, and it has one of the prime locations between the palazzo and the venetian, right in front of the blue man group entrance, across from v-bar, b&b, and next door to aquaknox.  i've walked by this place numerous times and always wanted to eat there.  suffice to say, in the past two years, i have.  in short, i have eaten at delmonico's 6 times.  not bad for someone that gives this place 3-stars.  \n\npros: \nwine list is expansive and can be very intimidating.  however, i question the knowledge of one of the staff when they recommended a pinot for our <mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark>.  i know a little bit about wine, well, who i am i kidding, i pretend to know a lot.  enough to the point that i didn't think i'd want a pinot.  however, it was his recommendation and i thought i would go with it.  it was definitely a pinot.  very disappointed since the body of it didn't fit right with our <mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark> (which was my concern to begin with).\nthe steak is choice (to steal my favorite john hughes film).\ncan sit large groups fairly easily.\nwill sit a table fairly late (almost 11pm on a friday night).\nexcellent sides.\nthey are fairly attentive with the service.\nthe scotch list is reasonable.  however, i do usually get a vodka martini with blue cheese stuffed olives (and they hit it pretty good).  \nthey do have a chef's table near the kitchen.  for a heavy trafficked weekend, i believe you have to book well into 3-months in advance (numbers change based on availability).  i am interested in trying this because i think it would be a blast to have a bunch of friends, drinking out of a magnum, and eating some good steak (but i'm not that organized nor do i have an event to do that with).  well, who am i kidding, i don't even have that many friends.  ha!  anyways...\n\n\ncons: \ni always get the <mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark> and each time i've eaten it, the seasoning (which i believe is a cajun based creole seasoning) is slightly different each time.  in some cases the seasoning can be too much and in others, its not enough.  there just isn't any consistency.\nall but one time i've eaten here someone has gotten the ribeye too rare or too well-done.  the fact that they can't get this right concerns me.  you are a steakhouse; get it right; its what you are supposed to be good at!\nthe decor is more monastery like.  \n\nthe first time i ate here, i gave it 4-stars (my meal was great, my girlfriends meal wasn't cooked right).  if they clean up their act and make things tight and organized, i think delmonico's is a 4-star steakhouse.  the steak is pretty tasty.  its perfectly okay to pick up the bone and start gnawin on it.  well, within reason of course.  however, it has too much inconsistency between day to day operations and meals.  to be fair, i'd still come and eat here (cause i believe the steak is an excellent quality of meat) but with the competition being so tight in vegas, i've started to venture out.",

            "delmonico steakhouse was pretty good, but definitely not the best i've had nor without flaws.\n\nthe food and drink choices seem to be where they really excel, as there were a number of options that my girlfriend and i found to be mouth-watering, from the <mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark>, the fillet, the chicken, salmon, etc.  they had my favorite beer (chimay blue) and she enjoyed her wine (she had the chardonnay and riesling).  what we wanted when going here was a nice, fancy dinner as a tribute to our vacation together.  it wasn't a special occasion or anything but we like to have a quality dinner from time to time.  i'd say the food part of emeril's more or less did the trick with regards to that.\n\nthe service was ok.  while they were relatively prompt the matre'd was the person who seemed to be serving us and he was just a little too over-the-top for me, not to mention he seemed a little condescending and careless.  perhaps i just read into it wrong, but i didn't feel as comfortable as i have at other restaurants.  our waiters made sure the waters and bread kept coming, which i appreciated.  the matre'd didn't really do anything rude per-say, but i did notice that at one point when he came by to check on everything he spoke with the tables on our left and right but not with us.  \n\nthe smaller tables are a little too big imo, my girlfriend and i felt a mile away from each other and eventually i just moved my place settings next to her and sat with her so we could talk easier.  this is probably not an issue if you have a big group, but for a romantic evening it wasn't fantastic.  speaking of romance, there were no candles, the lightning was bright, and the restaurant was devoid of decor. \n\ni don't mean to rip delmonico's so much but i just want to stress that this restaurant really doesn't deserve 5 stars despite the food being pretty tasty.  our stakes came out medium rare as requested, they were juicy and delicious, and the side \"double-<mark>Baked Idaho Potato</mark>\" + \"asparagus\" was fantastic.\n\ni realized going here and glancing at the menu online that the prices were going to be steep but i guess my wallet received a shock even so.  i had initially been hoping that our bill would come to about $115-130, but in the end it was $200 because you have to buy sides for your meal separately and the wine / beer was very expensive.  the problem with this is that in vegas there is a lot of competition and i've had food that was on par with this for under half the price of what i paid.  for instance mon ami gabi (outside of paris, paris) and trevi (ceasar's palace forum shops) both run in the $60-100 range (for two) and are just as tasty imo.\n\nlastly, there were a nat or two flying around toward the end of our meal, something which is unacceptable in a restaurant of this caliber.  \n\ni enjoyed the overall experience but i would not dine here again.", 
            "stopped by delmonico's for my birthday, per a recommendation from a friend... and i would not hesitate to come again.  i had the <mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark> and it was by far the best steak i've ever head, juicy and tender, and everything you want in a steak.  i ordered some sides but wasn't even necessary, i couldn't even finish the steak!  service was great.  a little on the pricey side but worth spending the money at least once.", 
            "just as good the second time around!  near perfect steak dinner, but not perfect.\n\nthis place is worth a repeat visit.  i really have to compliment the wait staff at this restaurant.  it seemed like there were more workers than patrons the night we were there.  \n\n<mark>Caesar Salad</mark> - i was very tempted to order an appetizer, but my gf reminded me we were about to eat over a pound of meat so we decided to share the <mark>Caesar Salad</mark>.  it was prepared table side by our waiter.  it was decent and a nice way to prepare my stomach for the main course.\n\n<mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark> - mine was cooked perfectly and well seasoned.  my particular cut was very, very tender.  my gf order the exact same steak and it wasn't nearly as good.  i had to share parts of my steak with her and we took the rest of hers to go.  hers wasn't bad, it just wasn't as good as mine.  \n\nsides - we ordered the creamed corn and asparagus.   the corn was very good.  it had a nice crust on the top and went well with my steak.  the asparagus was pretty plain.  i had to throw salt and pepper on it otherwise it was completely tasteless.  \n\ndessert - we ordered the banana cream pie.  i have no idea why we chose it, but i'm glad we did.  i would have usually ordered something chocolaty with ice cream but the banana cream pie sounded good.  well, it was good.  really good.  when it came out, i thought it was going to be way too sweet with all the caramel and chocolate shavings, but it wasn't.  we weren't even hungry after our meal, but we managed to put the entire dessert down.  \n\noverall, the food was good.  i have to give it 4 stars for the boring asparagus and inconsistent steak.  the wait staff was awesome.  they can have 5 stars.", 
            "i came here back in 2005 with my family and had a phenomenally memorable meal. six years later -- i came back this past weekend and it was stellar. extensive wine list, excellent service, ridiculously buttery brioche bread, great cocktails, and of course, the food!\n\nfor apps, my party had the <mark>Truffle and Parmesan Potato Chips</mark> (so rich but delish!), <mark>Butternut Squash Ravioli</mark> with duck confit (superb), <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> (mmm with large lobster chunks), and the wedge salad (as perfect as a classic wedge gets). \n\nfor entrees, i had the <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> that was perfectly cooked to a true medium-rare. i often find that, when i order med-rare, more often than not, highly rated restaurants overcook my meat to more of a med to med-well, which is can be disappointing. well, here at delmonico, it was perfect! friends got the <mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark> and the huge $85 fred flinstone steak (i forget the official name), all cooked to perfection. the 2007 joseph phelps cab paired divinely with the steaks. \n\nsides:  creamed corn was mind-blowing; <mark>Delmonico Creamed Spinach</mark> was good but didn't knock my socks off (compared to everything else which did). \n\nwe were too stuffed to order a dessert, but we received a complimentary birthday gelato. nice gesture, but it was not so great -- i think it was a non-conventional flavor, like fennel or something?\n\noverall, i would definitely return the next time i'm in the mood for a (pricey) steak dinner in vegas!!! emeril is a genius!",

            "wow, what a huge disappointment, considering how expensive the entrees are!\n\nmy girlfriends and i were totally famished when we got into vegas, thank goodness we had made reservations beforehand. we didn't wait long and had a drink in the lounge as we waited to be seated.\n\nafter browsing the menu, my friend and i decided to split the <mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark>, medium well. our server says it's their house specialty. the steak was completely blackened from the char and the inside was perfectly done. as i cut into it with my knife, i can tell it's going to be chewy....and indeed it was. it had almost no flavor for a dry aged meat. my friend had to ask for steak sauce and sour cream to make it more flavorful.\n\nbut, the sides we ordered (<mark>Potato Gratin</mark> and creamed corn) were awesome! and my friend's <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> was the most tender i've ever had (she gave me some of hers)\n\nthe service was impeccable and friendly...but the food (at least what i ate) was not worth $52 for a steak.", 
            "i've never had a meal experience like what i had at delmonico's. me and a buddy were in vegas for the first time and decided we wanted to go out for a good steak dinner. i asked for recommendations from people and settled on delmonico's. i made reservations the monday before the thursday we went to dinner. i checked out the menu ahead of time and was not surprised to see the pretty high prices., i was confident though that we were gonna get what we paid for. \nwe arrived about 45 minutes before the reservation time and had a couple beers in the lounge. $6 for a bud light was pretty reasonable for this atmosphere. we were seated promptly at 7 and that's where things got impressive. the dining area is secluded, you have no idea you are in a casino, which is great. we were greeted by one of our 3 waiters and offered the wine menu. neither of us drink wine, but i could tell the selection was awesome. \nwe ordered the <mark>Truffle and Parmesan Potato Chips</mark> and bowls of the gumbo. both were excellent, emeril knows gumbo. i ordered the <mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark> and my buddy got the filet. we also got the <mark>Potato Gratin</mark> and a twice <mark>Baked Idaho Potato</mark>. the sides are ala carte and family style. they were some of the best potatoes we had ever had. as for the steaks, they were both the greatest steaks we had ever had! no sauce is necessary for these babies. after dinner i had the banana cream pie, which was exceptional. my buddy had the cheesecake and said it was awesome. \noverall i can not speak highly enough of the dining experie nce at delmonico's. the professional staff, excellent atmosphere, and amazing food make delmonico's a place i will go to again.", 
            "we came here on a mission called \"20-ounce <mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark>\". that is all we wanted.\n\nso, we ordered the ribeye with mashed potatoes. we shared both over a few glasses of red wine. the steak is served with a glaze of butter worcestershire, bearnaise and chimichutri sauces. it was huge, beautifully cooked, and tasted good. it was missing one thing for me: salt! my impression was that it had none. my bf said he liked it as it was. don't get me wrong, it was a really good steak but it left me wanting more from the flavor spectrum. the potatoes were okay.\n\nservice is always impeccable at emeril's restaurants.",

            "as vegas steakhouses go, delmonico is a fine choice. i've been there twice and both times i've had very good meals. with that said, meeting expectations at this high price point is challenging, and particularly on my most recent visit i'm afraid delmonico should have been even better. this year we had a large company dinner at delmonico, so i was able to try lots of dishes. \n\nwe started with the bbq shrimp and the <mark>Butternut Squash Ravioli</mark>. the shrimp was good but a little overcooked. the squash was on the rich side but really tasty - you couldn't have but so many so it is good that they list it as an appetizer rather than as a pasta main. i loved one or two but a plateful would've been too much.  i also tried the <mark>Truffle and Parmesan Potato Chips</mark>, which were wonderful but extremely truffley. \n\nthe <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> was textbook, exactly what <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> is supposed to be - rich and creamy with chunks of tender lobster meat. still i might have preferred my neighbor's <mark>Vine-Ripened Heirloom Tomato Salad</mark>, which i tried and thought was one of the highlights of the meal.  i didn't try it but the duck from the smoked duck salad was not well received by another of my colleagues. \n\nfor my entr\\u00e9e i had the delmonico signature steak - a <mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark>. this is where the meal fell down ever so slightly. the steak was fine but for the premium price it should have been exceptional and it definitely wasn't. my order of medium rare was barely pink at all and was probably served on the dark side of medium, and i thought the meat was surprisingly devoid of flavor. don't get me wrong - it was a fine steak, but it was average among the steaks i've had in las vegas, at all price points. one of my close work friends who has frequented delmonico for years ordered the same cut at the dinner and he agreed that for his steak too it was an off-night. of the sides i loved the creamed corn. next time i'd do the mashed potatoes over the scalloped potatoes, which i found undercooked and under seasoned. the asparagus was also fine but unspectacular. \n\nthe bread pudding was great and the key lime pie (or was it cheesecake?) was nice too, but i'll reserve my sweetest accolades for the banana cream pie. best bite of the night. one of the best i've had. wonderful.",

(like bigger than my face huge!) it was one of the best steaks i've had.\n\nsides - i would highly recommend the sauteed garlic wild mushrooms and the twice <mark>Baked Idaho Potato</mark>. they went perfectly with the steak. both had good flavor and were prepared just right.\n\ndesserts - the duck egg creme brulee was good. it was creamy and had just the right amount of sweetness to it. i would also recommend the white chocolate macadamia nut bread pudding - it was scrumptious! \n\ni would say expect to spend about $100/pp. overall i very pleased with my experience here - from the atmosphere, to service to food; excellent delivery. \n\nkudos emeril!", 
            "my now fianc\\u00e9 took me here to celebrate after he proposed. i swear my starry eyes didn't affect the taste, it was incredible on its own. \n\nstarted with delicious krug champagne and oysters. i really appreciated quality oysters after having some sub-par ones the night before at a buffet. \n\nmy boyfriend ordered the <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> and i should have too. i ended up having a bit of his, it is not to be missed. we almost put in another order. \n\ni ordered the filet and he the <mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark>. both were delicious, and even though they are famous for the ribeye i liked the filet more. it was so lean and tender, cooked perfectly medium rare, but it was that charring on the outside that gave it this incredible flavor. the ribeye was fantastic too, it had a completely different flavor. my man preferred his ribeye so it worked perfectly. honestly can't say a bad thing about either. \n\nthey sent us a house mad sherbet to celebrate our engagement, and we finished with divine espresso. \n\nmy fianc\\u00e9 and i agree this was the most delicious and flawless meal we have shared. we will definitely return every time we come to vegas.", 
            "what better way to celebrate a big 3-0 than with a mean piece of steak! it was my good friend's birthday and we had two tables reserved for our big group. i must say, service was stellar. staff was knowledgeable with their menu and very patient with us when placing our orders in as we were all quite indecisive and had so many questions.   \n\nstarting off with some bread and aperitif, i chose a glass of blue label chimay as my poison. ahhhh...a wonderful prelude to an evening of indulgence. for appetizers, i had their oyster rockefeller. this baked aphrodisiac was not as cheesy as i hoped it would be but they were fresh and of good quality. i can't complain. \n\nnext came the main show, <mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark> which my man and i split. split plating was beautifully done with the perfect portion for each of us. no fee for split plate, thank you. i like my meat cooked medium and it came as pink as i expected it to be. a dollop of butter topped off my steak but that for me was unnecessary. it had quite a chew to it which was unlikely coming from chef emeril lagasse's kitchen. did it taste bad? no, not at all. i just think that being in vegas where you are surrounded by a plethora of dining options of the same caliber, you need to live up to your name. sadly, i wasn't as impressed by this dish compared to other fellow yelpers. \n\nmy side of choice was the <mark>Delmonico Creamed Spinach</mark>. now we're talking! it tasted sensational with that silky feel of butter and cream. finally, chef emeril's true colors are coming out. and on a sweet note, we ended the evening with emeril's banana cream pie. can i say, wow!? i will have to say this was the best banana cream pie i've had to date. hats off to you, chef! this my friends, earned delmonico steakhouse the 4 stars i'm giving them. \n\nwould i come back? sure! i'll skip the steak and try his southern specialties instead. but more importantly, i shall not forget emeril's banana cream pie. it's to die for!",

            "after a quick drink at public house, i was feeling pretty good, and hungry, and a little buzzed. here's how my conversation with our waiter began:\n\nme: \"what kind of bread is this?\"\nwaiter: \"they're popovers sir.\"\nme: \"has anyone ever commented that they're shaped like dicks?\" \nwaiter: \"haha, no sir, very good observation sir.\" \n\nyup, their popovers were pretty much shaped like dicks. they were a bit cold, oily, and combined with the refrigerated butter (one of my pet peeves at restaurants), a big disappointment. despite the phallic start to dinner, the rest of the meal and service was excellent. \n\nthe recommended <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> was a great way to cleanse my palate of that bread. there were big chunks of lobster meat and the bisque was well-seasoned without going overboard with the salt. delmonico is known for their <mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark> so i ordered that medium-rare. the steak was more on the medium side, but no complaints here as it was just as juicy and tender. no steak is complete without a side of <mark>Delmonico Creamed Spinach</mark>, which was done well. all sides are portioned to be shared. despite a misstep with my friend's order (bone-in ny strip instead of boneless), service was spot on.", 
            "great steak but disappointing service for the price.  went here for a friend's bachelor party.  we all got <mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark> medium rare (of course) with multiple sides and starters.  unfortunately, mine came out clearly at medium well.  which would be fine if i were not paying 50+ dollars to enjoy the wonderful dry-aged (etc., etc.) beef.  the steak still tasted good but not as great as it could have been.  i brought this to the attention of the waiter, who offered to bring me a new steak, but i did not wish to wait 15 minutes while my friends ate.  at the end of the meal, the waiter offered a free desert to make up for the steak, but we were all too full to enjoy one, so i declined.  no other offers were made to compensate for the overcooked steak (could have made any one of the drinks, appetizers or sides we ordered) and when the check arrived, the waiter had mistakenly added an extra bottle of wine to the tab (when brought to his attention, he removed it of course).  i know these are minor complaints, but having waited tables at much cheaper restaurants, i have found a way to make it up to a customer when mistakes were made.  i expect at least the same when a table is spending 400 dollars in your restaurant.  so all in all, the food was great, service good, but not up to par for the money you will spend.",

            "it is with a heavy heart, a disappointed palate, and an empty stomach that i write this review. at around 8:40pm on a wednesday like any other, an amazing 20 ounce <mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark> was murdered by the cooks at delmonico steakhouse in las vegas, nevada. a senseless, tragic loss really. \n\nthe ld: husband and i went for dinner. were seated immediately; had reservations. place was crowded; however, several tables were empty. servers (yes, plural; they employ a multi-function staff system) were friendly and knowledgeable. \n\nv&s for myself, beer for hub. both ordered the highly recommended in-house aged big ass ribeye; cooked med-rare please? add a side of asparagus. \n\ndrinks were delivered, as was a meh amuse bouche (didn't do much to invoke my appetite). while waiting on main course, we sat with empty drink glasses for approximately 15 minutes. \"yes, please, another round\" after flagging someone down.  \n\nthe highly anticipated steaks arrived. had so looked forward to dining (have been to delmonico in n'oleans and loved it) - salivating for the meat like pavlov's dog.\n\nhusband cut into his steak first and i awed at the perfection. beautifully cooked (i know my steak temps well and am quite skilled on the grill if i may say so; #humblebrag, but i do live in texas after all). i could immediately tell when my plate was sat down in front of me my steak was overcooked. i even whispered it to my spouse. sure enough, borderline well-done on the edges. i optimistically had hoped it would be less done toward the thicker center and toward the bone. nope.   \n\nwhen a waiter came to follow-up and ask how the steak was, i informed him mine...well, was not good. he did offer to refire; however, given the speed that my husband eats, and the amount of time it took the food to be delivered in the first place, i [foolishly] declined and stated that it was \"fine.\"\n\nmanagement comped one of the two tito's i ordered as an apology; however, this did little to suppress my internal sadness and the most amount of disappointment i'd had since losing my ars at the blackjack tables the night before. \n\nin all fairness, the staff at d's did try their best to accommodate. i probably should have allowed them a second chance to present a well-prepared piece of beef. it wasn't until i got home and found the $164 (w/out tip) receipt from the night in my wallet that i began to feel what can only be described as selfish-remorse (aka, sometimes referred to as \"buyer's remorse\").\n\nso after a few days of ruminating (as females are sometimes known to do), i called the restaurant and told them i regretted my decisions and to thank them for at least attempting to \"satisfy the customer.\" without any provocation, the manager offered to send me a gift card for $50 to cover a steak during my next visit. i, of course, did not expect the offer, but happily provided my mailing address. \n\ni have found that an unfortunate outcome of many \"celebrity\" chef restaurants opening in lv is that the quality of both service and food suffer. it's the nature of sin city and the abundance of tourism - people from all over the world with very different palates - some more or less discerning than others. :'(  \n\nso, now i have a gc that i can redeem at any of emeril's establishments. i doubt i'll be using it at delmonico in vegas baby, because frankly i've left the building and think i'll stick to d's in the big easy. sin city killed the beefy magic for me. cheers!\n\n[151 in 2015]",

            "i rarely write reviews, even though i rely on yelp very heavily for my restaurant selections! it's usually just because nothing overwhelmed me, or i was too lazy to do so - i'm trying to be better about that! my husband and i went to las vegas last week for our first year anniversary to get a way for a few days. we always try and scout out new restaurants. this was definitely our favorite meal - hands down! the entire experience was great -- they brought out a small treat for us to start, then we both had amazing bourbon cocktails, and then dove into the delicious food. i got the <mark>Filet Mignon</mark>, but prepared piedmontese style which is just seasoning, olive oil, roasted garlic, and rosemary - it was cooked perfectly (medium) and super tender and had great flavoring. it didn't need any sauce! my husband got the <mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark> which they are known for i believe - i had a few bites and it was fantastic. the au gratin potatoes were also good and not overly heavy like some can be. our wine was great as well, stag's leap. the best part of the experience though was our waiter rene. he was so attentive, fun to talk to, and just wanted us to enjoy ourselves. he really made this experience special. i also have some dietary restrictions and i've never seen a restaurant be so attentive to them. it really put me at ease. next time you're in vegas, go here. we'll be returning for new year's this year and have already recommended it to some friends going out later this month!",

            "i seem to have really good luck with emeril's restaurants. after my recent visit to delmonico's, i'm beginning to think he can't go wrong. from the moment we walked in the door, it was just instantly different from all the other restaurants we visited. we were greeted warmly, seated immediately even though we were early, and had friendly, attentive service the entire time. \n\nthe atmosphere inside delmonico's is not at all what i would have expected, but it is simple and lovely. the colors are warm, the lighting is excellent (especially at a steakhouse, i need to be able to see my food!), and the decor is plain and easy on the eyes (not a lot of decoration at all).\n\nwe started with some <mark>Truffle and Parmesan Potato Chips</mark> and a <mark>Vine-Ripened Heirloom Tomato Salad</mark> to share while we were getting settled. vince curled up with the wine list with a big, giant grin on his face. ah, so many choices to go with steak, but we can't really go wrong with chambolle musigny, so there you go, and we threw in a bottle of sancerre to start. \n\ni ended up getting emeril's famous <mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark>, vince got the filet, and phil and alexandra got bbq shrimp and mushroom medallions. we also got an assortment of sides, including spinach, asparagus, mushrooms, and garlic <mark>Country Smashed Potatoes</mark>. for someone who likes pure, unadulterated meat, my ribeye was about as perfect as you can get. cooked to my desired rare plus bloodiness, with a simple crust of emeril's essence, a beautiful quality cut without any tendons or gristle, just beautiful meatiness. vince's filet was similarly perfect, nice and thick and bloody, with a delicious cajun rub that enhanced the meat without overpowering it. i was impressed with alexandra's medallions - they were pretty large for medallions; they looked like big 4 oz filets in their own right. i'd had the shrimp before at emeril's seafood restaurant so that was nothing new but those were also good. the spinach actually tasted like spinach (rather than cream), and the asparagus was nice and al dente. \n\ni finished up with some pecan pie, a generous jamaica blue mountain espresso (i was impressed that the coffee list provided a wide variety of espressos from which to choose), and a cognac. too bad it was only lunch! this meal was certainly the highlight of our trip (in addition to being the best, it was also the least expensive). afterwards our server took us on a tour of the restaurant. next time we are definitely going to try to reserve the chef's table. i already can't wait!",

            "my experience at delmonico steakhouse was well-above average, but not as fantastic as i thought it would be.  first off, although we had made reservations well in advance, we had to wait over 20 minutes for our table.  all was not completely lost, however, since we passed the time in delmonico's classy little, modish bar area where we got started on our red wine for the evening. \n\nthere was a bit of confusion amongst the servers shortly after we were seated, and we experienced a delay in receiving our selection of bottled waters for our table.  at delmonico, they give you the option of choosing from a few types of bottled and mineral waters for an additional charge, or you can request just regular,complimentary tap water. after the initial delay, our water glasses were refilled continuously throughout the meal, however. \n\nlike most five star restaurants, at delmonico steakhouse, you receive service from several members of the waitstaff, which ensures constant attention and most of your dining needs are met without even having to request anything.\n\nthe interior of the steakhouse was minimalist, with tables covered in cream colored linens and simple, modern brown leather chairs for seating. the space had a slightly mediterranean feel due to its coved ceilings.  no doubt because the restaurant is located inside the venetian hotel, they wanted to maintain a slightly italian theme througout. \n\nthe restaurant, which was was packed with patrons, was also very loud.  i think the coved ceilings were extremely conducive to the noise level contained in the dining room.  this combined with brighter than desired lighting, created a slightly less intimate dining experience than were were anticipating.  \n\nthe food was very good, however.  we started with the crabcake, and it was tender, buttery and delicious.  followed by that, were our iceberg wedge salads with bacon, blue cheese and all the yummies.  hubby ordered the <mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark>, and i ordered the bone-in ny strip, both were cooked to medium perfection.  for sides, we shared a huge, delicious <mark>Baked Idaho Potato</mark> with sour cream, bacon, green onions and cheddar. for dessert, we shared the caramel creme brulee, and it was very, very good.\n\noverall, we enjoyed our meal very much, and we would return here again for the food.  our experience was just was not over-the-top fabulous because of the noise and lighting factors.",

            "7 girls, after a long 4 hour drive, arrived at the venetian on a mission for some hearty steak.  delmonico was the answer to our problem.  we were so exhausted that we didn't even bother pretty-ing ourselves up before hand...dumped out bags and headed straight to dinner.  we were worried that our shorts and flip-flop attire wasn't going to cut it but aside from some dirty stares from some of the other guests, the wait staff kindly turned their heads.  \n\nthe service was impeccable.   they started us off with a goat cheese puff pastry to cleanse our pallets, compliments of the chef.  all of us buddied up and ordered the <mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark> steak...which was plenty to go around.  tasty, it sure was but i'd have to say, i've had better.  the <mark>Sauted Garlic Mushrooms</mark>, creamed corn, cheddar bacon grits, and sauteed asparagus sides were great compliments set in the middle of the table for all of us to share.  we were seated at a circular table which was ideal for conversation instead of screaming across a long table.  by dessert, we were stuffed...next time for sure.  \n\nsince we didn't order any wine to compliment the dinners that we all split, delmonico left the robbing of our $$ to the casinos.  i know if i went with just my boyfriend, it'd be one less night we could stay at the venetian.",

            "about 2 years ago, i had dreamed of eating steak at delmonico's.  the reputation of this place exceeds my expectations; and, as such, is my dilemma with this place.  delmonico's is emeril lagasse's steak house.  it is his prime choice, so-to-speak, and it has one of the prime locations between the palazzo and the venetian, right in front of the blue man group entrance, across from v-bar, b&b, and next door to aquaknox.  i've walked by this place numerous times and always wanted to eat there.  suffice to say, in the past two years, i have.  in short, i have eaten at delmonico's 6 times.  not bad for someone that gives this place 3-stars.  \n\npros: \nwine list is expansive and can be very intimidating.  however, i question the knowledge of one of the staff when they recommended a pinot for our <mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark>.  i know a little bit about wine, well, who i am i kidding, i pretend to know a lot.  enough to the point that i didn't think i'd want a pinot.  however, it was his recommendation and i thought i would go with it.  it was definitely a pinot.  very disappointed since the body of it didn't fit right with our <mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark> (which was my concern to begin with).\nthe steak is choice (to steal my favorite john hughes film).\ncan sit large groups fairly easily.\nwill sit a table fairly late (almost 11pm on a friday night).\nexcellent sides.\nthey are fairly attentive with the service.\nthe scotch list is reasonable.  however, i do usually get a vodka martini with blue cheese stuffed olives (and they hit it pretty good).  \nthey do have a chef's table near the kitchen.  for a heavy trafficked weekend, i believe you have to book well into 3-months in advance (numbers change based on availability).  i am interested in trying this because i think it would be a blast to have a bunch of friends, drinking out of a magnum, and eating some good steak (but i'm not that organized nor do i have an event to do that with).  well, who am i kidding, i don't even have that many friends.  ha!  anyways...\n\n\ncons: \ni always get the <mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark> and each time i've eaten it, the seasoning (which i believe is a cajun based creole seasoning) is slightly different each time.  in some cases the seasoning can be too much and in others, its not enough.  there just isn't any consistency.\nall but one time i've eaten here someone has gotten the ribeye too rare or too well-done.  the fact that they can't get this right concerns me.  you are a steakhouse; get it right; its what you are supposed to be good at!\nthe decor is more monastery like.  \n\nthe first time i ate here, i gave it 4-stars (my meal was great, my girlfriends meal wasn't cooked right).  if they clean up their act and make things tight and organized, i think delmonico's is a 4-star steakhouse.  the steak is pretty tasty.  its perfectly okay to pick up the bone and start gnawin on it.  well, within reason of course.  however, it has too much inconsistency between day to day operations and meals.  to be fair, i'd still come and eat here (cause i believe the steak is an excellent quality of meat) but with the competition being so tight in vegas, i've started to venture out.", 
            "first off i love emeril i think his food is old school and sloppy, but i love him and don't doubt his food is delicous! so i was excited to go there. i am a chef, and a succesful one i've ran restaurants and now i am a private chef, so i know food and service! i was with my girlfriend and another couple, from the start we were treated like we didn't belong there. they forgot to bring us our wine for like 20 minutes. the table beside us arrived after us and recieved their wine and food before us! they recieved excellent service, getting a amuse bouch, and all served at the same time! we were treated like dishwashers. i thought the food was ok, crabcake was decent but lacked simple seasoning salt and pepper! i thought they would at least make there own bread, but no. the <mark>Ribeye</mark> were charred black and had no seasoning, filet was ok but lacked seasoning. gnocchi was great but a little salty. all in all food lacked seasoning, waiter was a asshole, all though the manager was cool i will never step foot in there again!!!!!!!!",

            "disappointing or too high of expectations? \n\nwhen i am spending $50 for a steak (<mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark>) which was recommended by the waiter was the best steak on the menu i have particularly high expectations. the dishes are all a la carte so i also ordered a side of asparagus, potatoes augratin and <mark>Sauted Garlic Mushrooms</mark>. \n\nthe steak was a large serving (14 oz) but i found it lacked in flavor for my expectations. i have had better steak at high end restaurants....", 
            "this place was the bomb-digity!  one of the best meals i've ever had.  i know they are known for the <mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark> but go with the filet <mark>Oscar Style</mark>.   my crew and i were out for my bachelor party and we had a 10:30pm dinner and we ended up staying there till about 1 in the morning.  the wait staff was awesome, not pushy at all and very helpful.  even joked with us a little bit.  we were definitely the last ones in the place but they were happy to let us stay as long as we wanted.  highly recommend this place, very classy.", 
            "the best steakhouse ever. the perfect amount of seasoning/flavor and a nice huge cut of perfectly cooked <mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark> earns this establishment a 5 from me. every time i eat at a different steakhouse i always compare it to delmonico's. some other steakhouses in lv might hold a higher rating from \"professional reviewers\", but seriously, they don't hold a candle to this joint.", 
            "looking at all the reviews, maybe i went on an off night, but i've had better steaks at home on my own grill from the local market.  went with a group of 9 and ordered the \"surf and turf\" consisting of the ribeye and a seafood mashed potato combo.\n\nthe good - mashed potatoes were excellent, generous lump seafood, very tasty.  side dishes also were excellent.\n\nthe disappointing - the ribeye.  ordered it medium rare, as did my friend next to me.  both of our steaks were probably cooked closer to medium, neither was juicy or tender, there seemed to be no marbled fat content at all, and the texture was almost grainy.\n\ni'll eat everything from in n out to more foodie type establishments, always with a smile on my face, but this experience was a bit of a shock to me.  i've had <mark>Ribeye</mark> for 1/3 the price but infinitely better.  \n\nweird.  but i think i'd rather try somewhere else as i wouldn't want a repeat experience at that price point.", 
            "excellent steakhouse. every time i visit las vegas i make sure to get a comp for delmonico. it consistently remains a solid restaurant. one of my favorite restaurants overall.\n\nservice is great.\n\nfood is amazing. trumpets sounded when i took my first bite into the \"<mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark>.\" \n\ni would highly recommend that you discuss with your server the definition of medium rare and medium. i know one time a friend said it was undercooked for medium rare, but honestly it was fine. he had a different definition for medium rare based on past experiences with \"other steakhouses\" (but i am not sure i would refer to them as real steakhouses).", 
            "i come here every time i visit vegas. the <mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark> is solid, i usually eat at the bar by myself, servers are friendly and attentive without being intrusive.", 
            "delicious.\n\ni took my boyfriend here as part of his vegas weekend treat (i secretly wanted to try it out too) and it did not disappoint. the service was amazing as you would expect for this type of restaurant. i made a note on our opentable reservation that it was for his birthday and every single person wished him a happy birthday, by name, as well as giving us lots of free goodies! \n\nwe pretty much ordered everything our hearts desired (which was a lot more than our stomachs could hold):\n\n<mark>Truffle and Parmesan Potato Chips</mark> - sounds simple enough, but i definitely recommend. nice, simple appetizer that happens to be divine.\n\nrun of the mill mixed greens and <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark>. the <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> is a must try! best i've had!\n\n<mark>Filet Mignon</mark> and <mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark> for our main course. very flavorful, cooked to perfection. the <mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark> is huge, so bring your appetite for this one.\n\nwe had chocolate sorbet on the house and ordered an additional slice of banana cream pie (we were curious why emeril's name was attached to it). that is the first time i've had banana cream pie and i feel like i could never eat it again unless it came from here. \n\nwonderful experience and will definitely have to make a trip back.", 
            "delmonico steakhouse was pretty good, but definitely not the best i've had nor without flaws.\n\nthe food and drink choices seem to be where they really excel, as there were a number of options that my girlfriend and i found to be mouth-watering, from the <mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark>, the fillet, the chicken, salmon, etc.  they had my favorite beer (chimay blue) and she enjoyed her wine (she had the chardonnay and riesling).  what we wanted when going here was a nice, fancy dinner as a tribute to our vacation together.  it wasn't a special occasion or anything but we like to have a quality dinner from time to time.  i'd say the food part of emeril's more or less did the trick with regards to that.\n\nthe service was ok.  while they were relatively prompt the matre'd was the person who seemed to be serving us and he was just a little too over-the-top for me, not to mention he seemed a little condescending and careless.  perhaps i just read into it wrong, but i didn't feel as comfortable as i have at other restaurants.  our waiters made sure the waters and bread kept coming, which i appreciated.  the matre'd didn't really do anything rude per-say, but i did notice that at one point when he came by to check on everything he spoke with the tables on our left and right but not with us.  \n\nthe smaller tables are a little too big imo, my girlfriend and i felt a mile away from each other and eventually i just moved my place settings next to her and sat with her so we could talk easier.  this is probably not an issue if you have a big group, but for a romantic evening it wasn't fantastic.  speaking of romance, there were no candles, the lightning was bright, and the restaurant was devoid of decor. \n\ni don't mean to rip delmonico's so much but i just want to stress that this restaurant really doesn't deserve 5 stars despite the food being pretty tasty.  our stakes came out medium rare as requested, they were juicy and delicious, and the side \"double-<mark>Baked Idaho Potato</mark>\" + \"asparagus\" was fantastic.\n\ni realized going here and glancing at the menu online that the prices were going to be steep but i guess my wallet received a shock even so.  i had initially been hoping that our bill would come to about $115-130, but in the end it was $200 because you have to buy sides for your meal separately and the wine / beer was very expensive.  the problem with this is that in vegas there is a lot of competition and i've had food that was on par with this for under half the price of what i paid.  for instance mon ami gabi (outside of paris, paris) and trevi (ceasar's palace forum shops) both run in the $60-100 range (for two) and are just as tasty imo.\n\nlastly, there were a nat or two flying around toward the end of our meal, something which is unacceptable in a restaurant of this caliber.  \n\ni enjoyed the overall experience but i would not dine here again.", 
            "stopped by delmonico's for my birthday, per a recommendation from a friend... and i would not hesitate to come again.  i had the <mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark> and it was by far the best steak i've ever head, juicy and tender, and everything you want in a steak.  i ordered some sides but wasn't even necessary, i couldn't even finish the steak!  service was great.  a little on the pricey side but worth spending the money at least once.", 
            "just as good the second time around!  near perfect steak dinner, but not perfect.\n\nthis place is worth a repeat visit.  i really have to compliment the wait staff at this restaurant.  it seemed like there were more workers than patrons the night we were there.  \n\n<mark>Caesar Salad</mark> - i was very tempted to order an appetizer, but my gf reminded me we were about to eat over a pound of meat so we decided to share the <mark>Caesar Salad</mark>.  it was prepared table side by our waiter.  it was decent and a nice way to prepare my stomach for the main course.\n\n<mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark> - mine was cooked perfectly and well seasoned.  my particular cut was very, very tender.  my gf order the exact same steak and it wasn't nearly as good.  i had to share parts of my steak with her and we took the rest of hers to go.  hers wasn't bad, it just wasn't as good as mine.  \n\nsides - we ordered the creamed corn and asparagus.   the corn was very good.  it had a nice crust on the top and went well with my steak.  the asparagus was pretty plain.  i had to throw salt and pepper on it otherwise it was completely tasteless.  \n\ndessert - we ordered the banana cream pie.  i have no idea why we chose it, but i'm glad we did.  i would have usually ordered something chocolaty with ice cream but the banana cream pie sounded good.  well, it was good.  really good.  when it came out, i thought it was going to be way too sweet with all the caramel and chocolate shavings, but it wasn't.  we weren't even hungry after our meal, but we managed to put the entire dessert down.  \n\noverall, the food was good.  i have to give it 4 stars for the boring asparagus and inconsistent steak.  the wait staff was awesome.  they can have 5 stars.", 
            "i came here back in 2005 with my family and had a phenomenally memorable meal. six years later -- i came back this past weekend and it was stellar. extensive wine list, excellent service, ridiculously buttery brioche bread, great cocktails, and of course, the food!\n\nfor apps, my party had the <mark>Truffle and Parmesan Potato Chips</mark> (so rich but delish!), <mark>Butternut Squash Ravioli</mark> with duck confit (superb), <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> (mmm with large lobster chunks), and the wedge salad (as perfect as a classic wedge gets). \n\nfor entrees, i had the <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> that was perfectly cooked to a true medium-rare. i often find that, when i order med-rare, more often than not, highly rated restaurants overcook my meat to more of a med to med-well, which is can be disappointing. well, here at delmonico, it was perfect! friends got the <mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark> and the huge $85 fred flinstone steak (i forget the official name), all cooked to perfection. the 2007 joseph phelps cab paired divinely with the steaks. \n\nsides:  creamed corn was mind-blowing; <mark>Delmonico Creamed Spinach</mark> was good but didn't knock my socks off (compared to everything else which did). \n\nwe were too stuffed to order a dessert, but we received a complimentary birthday gelato. nice gesture, but it was not so great -- i think it was a non-conventional flavor, like fennel or something?\n\noverall, i would definitely return the next time i'm in the mood for a (pricey) steak dinner in vegas!!! emeril is a genius!",

            "fantastic <mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark>. perfectly marbled. delicious cajun rub. great wine selection. the gumbo was great, but a little too refined...almost like a stew. ambiance was a bit sterile. but, you're here for the steak... and it's awesome.", 
            "they are known for their <mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark> so i had to try that.  i ordered mine medium rare and it was a little undercooked but still very tasty.  the steak was good but not the best i've had.  what was really amazing was the white fish.  this was the first time i tried the white fish and i will order this again.  i also tried the new orleans bbq shrimp which was good and the au gratin potatoes.  the sides are huge and we had a hard time finishing one side.  service was excellent and the restaurant had a nice modern contemporary look which i liked.  overall, a good steakhouse and i had a good experience here.", 
            "ahhh. delmonico. i always make a point to visit this restaurant when i am in nevada, for this is my favorite steakhouse. the ambience is quite dim, and the overall atmosphere simple and elegant.\n\nwe started out with the <mark>Truffle and Parmesan Potato Chips</mark> as well as the pork trotter. the chips= simply amazing. the chip was light and airy, yet when you bite into it, you get the perfect combination of truffle oil and crisp potato. the pork trotter was also good, but i believe that it was better the last time i came.\n\nas for the steak, i ordered their signature <mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark> with a side of spinach. the steak came with butter on top, which i found different because not many other steakhouses included that. the steak was delicious; and i was able to finish it without problem.\n\nhowever, i was too full for dessert, and did not have the opportunity to see the desert menu. last time when i was here, i remember the peach or apple (some fruit) tart with ice cream was the best.",

            "as vegas steakhouses go, delmonico is a fine choice. i've been there twice and both times i've had very good meals. with that said, meeting expectations at this high price point is challenging, and particularly on my most recent visit i'm afraid delmonico should have been even better. this year we had a large company dinner at delmonico, so i was able to try lots of dishes. \n\nwe started with the bbq shrimp and the <mark>Butternut Squash Ravioli</mark>. the shrimp was good but a little overcooked. the squash was on the rich side but really tasty - you couldn't have but so many so it is good that they list it as an appetizer rather than as a pasta main. i loved one or two but a plateful would've been too much.  i also tried the <mark>Truffle and Parmesan Potato Chips</mark>, which were wonderful but extremely truffley. \n\nthe <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> was textbook, exactly what <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> is supposed to be - rich and creamy with chunks of tender lobster meat. still i might have preferred my neighbor's <mark>Vine-Ripened Heirloom Tomato Salad</mark>, which i tried and thought was one of the highlights of the meal.  i didn't try it but the duck from the smoked duck salad was not well received by another of my colleagues. \n\nfor my entr\\u00e9e i had the delmonico signature steak - a <mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark>. this is where the meal fell down ever so slightly. the steak was fine but for the premium price it should have been exceptional and it definitely wasn't. my order of medium rare was barely pink at all and was probably served on the dark side of medium, and i thought the meat was surprisingly devoid of flavor. don't get me wrong - it was a fine steak, but it was average among the steaks i've had in las vegas, at all price points. one of my close work friends who has frequented delmonico for years ordered the same cut at the dinner and he agreed that for his steak too it was an off-night. of the sides i loved the creamed corn. next time i'd do the mashed potatoes over the scalloped potatoes, which i found undercooked and under seasoned. the asparagus was also fine but unspectacular. \n\nthe bread pudding was great and the key lime pie (or was it cheesecake?) was nice too, but i'll reserve my sweetest accolades for the banana cream pie. best bite of the night. one of the best i've had. wonderful.",

            "quite possibly, the best steak i ever had.  went here with my wife and made sure i had reservations.  we were seated promptly upon arrival.  the rolls were delicious, as they are in all of emeril's restaurants.  ordered the <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> soup, which was incredible.  the large pieces of lobster inside the soup just made it all that much better.  i ordered the <mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark> and my wife ordered the filet.  both steaks were cooked perfectly and were extremely tender.  we also enjoyed the twice <mark>Baked Idaho Potato</mark> with our meal.  for dessert, we had to have the banana cream pie.  it was absolutely fabulous.  it had chocolate shavings drizzled on top and caramel sauce on the plate.  this is not your ordinary piece of pie.  it was absolutely heaven.  we had a fantastic meal, just like we have at emeril's other restaurants.  the service was excellent and the staff was very friendly.", 
            "i recently had 2 lunches and dinner at this restaurant. i must say that their atlantic salmon on the lunch menu was the bomb!  it comes with corn and crab pieces with the salmon. ask for medium and your salmon steak would be just perfect! \n\ntheir lobster brisk soup is also delicious. however, it is on the pricier side. i believe about $11 at lunch time for the soup and $14 at dinner time.  \n\ni also had their salad for lunch... i forgot the name but it's the one with arugula, spinach and 3-4 different chunks of cheeses. it was delicious!! \n\nfor dinner i had the bone-in aged ribeye, <mark>Pan Seared <mark>Foie Gras</mark></mark> appetizer, cream corn, and the mixed green salad.\n\nthe appetizer <mark>Pan Seared <mark>Foie Gras</mark></mark> when it was first served was over cooked and dry. also, the brioche breads served with the <mark>Pan Seared <mark>Foie Gras</mark></mark> had peanut butter sauce on them which in my opinion did not go well with the <mark>Pan Seared <mark>Foie Gras</mark></mark> sauce and the citrus taste of the dish.  however, when our server found out that we were not fond of our appetizer dish, he took the initiative to recommend that we send the dish back and have the kitchen remake the <mark>Pan Seared <mark>Foie Gras</mark></mark> dish the way we like it. our server was so courteous and genuine, we felt comfortable expressing our concern and dislike re the dish. the kitchen remade the dish in the way i liked it which was the traditional way of just plainly light grill of the <mark>Pan Seared <mark>Foie Gras</mark></mark> and serve it with olive oil and the side vinegratte sauce. \n\nwhen they brought out the <mark>Pan Seared <mark>Foie Gras</mark></mark> dish the second time, the <mark>Pan Seared <mark>Foie Gras</mark></mark> was tender, tasted like butter which melted in my mouth and the brioche breads complemented the tender <mark>Pan Seared <mark>Foie Gras</mark></mark> to a t.  btw, the <mark>Pan Seared <mark>Foie Gras</mark></mark> piece was huge. it was definitely worth the $25 high sticker price for an appetizer. :)\n\ni must say that the service here is superb!!! they really take serving you seriously. they strive to take very good care of their customers. if you don't like a dish that you order, they will do everything they can to do it right!!!   their high quality service boosted this review of their restaurant to a solid 5 star rating.\n\nthe <mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark> was very well cooked. it was a perfect medium just as we ordered.  the meat itself had a herbal rub taste to it which i was not too fond of.  however, after i added a little bit of the leftover vinegratte sauce from the <mark>Pan Seared <mark>Foie Gras</mark></mark> to it from time to time, the citrus/acidity of the vinegratte really brought the natural flavor of the meat out. it was not the best piece of steak in terms of flavor that i've ever had, but it was definitely a high quality steak. \n\nthe mixed green dinner salad was pretty good. very fresh but i like the lunch salad better. \n\noverall, i would say that i really enjoyed my visits at this restaurant. i would definitely keep coming back here for their lunch salmon and salad. i may visit it sometime again for dinner to try their other steaks dishes to see if i'd find another steak dish that i'd like here better. \n\nit's a solid 5 star restaurant re quality of their food and their superb customer service which were very appreciated!\n\ngive them a try!", 
            "i have not written a yelp review in over two years, however after having delmonico's i felt compelled to dig up the old yelp account to share my experience.\n\ni loved the atmosphere. it had a very nice ambiance to it. the lighting was dim and the decor was simple. attire was dressy/casual. \n\nstarting with apps, we had the oysters and <mark>Pan Seared <mark>Foie Gras</mark></mark>. the oysters were exceptionally fresh. no complaints about the <mark>Pan Seared <mark>Foie Gras</mark></mark>. i also had the <mark>Traditional New Orleans Gumbo</mark> which was good, but i'd pass on the next time around.\n\nmain courses - <mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark> was fantastic. the seasoning was great and the steak itself was cooked to perfection. the portion was huge. (like bigger than my face huge!) it was one of the best steaks i've had.\n\nsides - i would highly recommend the sauteed garlic wild mushrooms and the twice <mark>Baked Idaho Potato</mark>. they went perfectly with the steak. both had good flavor and were prepared just right.\n\ndesserts - the duck egg creme brulee was good. it was creamy and had just the right amount of sweetness to it. i would also recommend the white chocolate macadamia nut bread pudding - it was scrumptious! \n\ni would say expect to spend about $100/pp. overall i very pleased with my experience here - from the atmosphere, to service to food; excellent delivery. \n\nkudos emeril!", 
            "my now fianc\\u00e9 took me here to celebrate after he proposed. i swear my starry eyes didn't affect the taste, it was incredible on its own. \n\nstarted with delicious krug champagne and oysters. i really appreciated quality oysters after having some sub-par ones the night before at a buffet. \n\nmy boyfriend ordered the <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> and i should have too. i ended up having a bit of his, it is not to be missed. we almost put in another order. \n\ni ordered the filet and he the <mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark>. both were delicious, and even though they are famous for the ribeye i liked the filet more. it was so lean and tender, cooked perfectly medium rare, but it was that charring on the outside that gave it this incredible flavor. the ribeye was fantastic too, it had a completely different flavor. my man preferred his ribeye so it worked perfectly. honestly can't say a bad thing about either. \n\nthey sent us a house mad sherbet to celebrate our engagement, and we finished with divine espresso. \n\nmy fianc\\u00e9 and i agree this was the most delicious and flawless meal we have shared. we will definitely return every time we come to vegas.", 
            "what better way to celebrate a big 3-0 than with a mean piece of steak! it was my good friend's birthday and we had two tables reserved for our big group. i must say, service was stellar. staff was knowledgeable with their menu and very patient with us when placing our orders in as we were all quite indecisive and had so many questions.   \n\nstarting off with some bread and aperitif, i chose a glass of blue label chimay as my poison. ahhhh...a wonderful prelude to an evening of indulgence. for appetizers, i had their oyster rockefeller. this baked aphrodisiac was not as cheesy as i hoped it would be but they were fresh and of good quality. i can't complain. \n\nnext came the main show, <mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark> which my man and i split. split plating was beautifully done with the perfect portion for each of us. no fee for split plate, thank you. i like my meat cooked medium and it came as pink as i expected it to be. a dollop of butter topped off my steak but that for me was unnecessary. it had quite a chew to it which was unlikely coming from chef emeril lagasse's kitchen. did it taste bad? no, not at all. i just think that being in vegas where you are surrounded by a plethora of dining options of the same caliber, you need to live up to your name. sadly, i wasn't as impressed by this dish compared to other fellow yelpers. \n\nmy side of choice was the <mark>Delmonico Creamed Spinach</mark>. now we're talking! it tasted sensational with that silky feel of butter and cream. finally, chef emeril's true colors are coming out. and on a sweet note, we ended the evening with emeril's banana cream pie. can i say, wow!? i will have to say this was the best banana cream pie i've had to date. hats off to you, chef! this my friends, earned delmonico steakhouse the 4 stars i'm giving them. \n\nwould i come back? sure! i'll skip the steak and try his southern specialties instead. but more importantly, i shall not forget emeril's banana cream pie. it's to die for!", 
            "we had dinner reservations to celebrate a special event. we started off with a few drinks.\n\nfried soft-shell crab:\nan appetizer with poached egg, frisee salad and lemon truffle vinaigrette. lightly breaded and fried. not greasy, not fatty and <mark>Half Dozen Raw Oysters on the Half Shell</mark> was definitely soft. the citrusy salad compliments the dish. one of the best soft-shell crab versions i've had. we got 2 orders of these - they were that good. 5/5\n\n<mark>Filet Mignon</mark>:\nsince i'm not a fan of animal fat, this is what i normally get. some people may find it boring but i like my steak simple and lean. very tender and cooked to a perfect medium-rare. this piece of meat didn't photograph very well since it looks so dark from all the pepper but it tasted good. 4/5\n\nchateaubriand:\nthe second most tender and lean cut of meat. we got mashed potatoes and asparagus on the side. 4/5\n\n<mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark>:\ndry-aged prime with butter on top. superb! 4/5\n\n<mark>Pan Seared <mark>Foie Gras</mark></mark>:\nthis was a side item. perfectly seared and mildly sweet. you don't really need to do much to make <mark>Pan Seared <mark>Foie Gras</mark></mark> taste good. kiss (keep it simple, stupid!) 4.5/5\n\nmushrooms with garlic:\nthis side was really good. i love mushrooms and garlic. the mushrooms did not have just a hint of garlic. they were deliciously garlicky. 5/5\n\ngrits:\nthis has bacon and good melted cheese which makes this more interesting than it should be. i wouldn't normally eat grits but this was good. 4/5\n\ncreme brulee:\ni've been feeling tired of this dessert. i didn't find joy in eating this. plain, ordinary and too safe. 2/5\n\ndelmonico coquetel:\ngin, sparkling dessert wine, five spice-infused simple syrup, ruby red grapefruit and lime juices. their signature cocktail...but why? our server was right, i should've not wasted my time on this. it was too sweet and it just didn't taste right. i took a few sips and our server knew it was time for a different drink. 2/5\n\na tale of two cities:\ncherry vodka, elderflower liqueur, black cherry juice and citrus juices. this was deliciously amazing if you like cherry. 5/5\n\nanother drink we had was a martini with bleu cheese-stuffed olives. since i'm not a fan of martini, olives or bleu cheese - it would not be fair for me to rate this. we got a free chocolate gelato and it was good. service was good. our server gave us recommendations and what to stay away from. honesty is always appreciated.",

            "update - \n\ndelmonico / emeril's staff reached out to me via yelp a couple of days after i posted the review, and i ended up having a good conversation with their director of operations in las vegas.  mike told me he reviewed the events of the evening with the staff at delmonico, including the mistakes that were made and ways to ensure it doesn't happen in the future.  he asked that i give them another chance and let him know when i'm going to be in vegas again, which i most certainly will. \n\ni'm very impressed with their response and how they took the review as an opportunity to improve. \n\noriginal review - \n\none of the worst high end las vegas restaurant experiences i've ever had.\n\ndinner started out alright.  larger party of 15, restaurant spread us across 2 tables instead of handling us as one; acceptable, but not thrilling. initial greeting with menus and wine lists was prompt and fast. \n\nafter that, follow up service to get drink orders and appetizers was very slow. orders were finally taken and again, return to deliver the drinks took a while. \n\nwhen time came to order, my wife and i were among the first in the group.  i ordered a tableside caesar for 2, a special bone in filet medium rare for my wife and a special bone in filet blue (think less cooked than rare, if you don't know it) for myself. \n\nthe pop-overs are fantastic, and the tableside caesar was great. the gentleman who prepared it was kind enough to give me a couple of hints how they do the caesar dressing which i'm looking forward to trying in my own caesar dressing. \n\nat this point, the wheels came off the bus. i finished my glass of wine with the caesar and tried repeatedly to signal our waiter john for another glass and failed. my wife got into trying to get his attention as well and failed multiple times before finally succeeding. \n\nrough bus, meet out of control bus. dinner arrives, and my wife and i are simultaneously served bone in <mark>Ribeye</mark>. hers medium rare, mine blue (our order was filets - medium rare and blue). we promptly object and are corrected at first by the waitstaff that we got what we ordered (we never order <mark>Ribeye</mark> as we both like our steaks too rare for a ribeye's flavor to come out).\n\nthe waiter comes over after some confusion and tells me he brought me what i ordered. after some quick discussion our incorrect steaks are removed and we're told our special of the evening, bone in filets, are on their way. \n\nnot minutes later, we're told they've sold out of the special and we can have regular filets. since the rest of our group has already been eating we just say fine, whatever, bring us a medium rare and a blue filet. \n\nthree different people drop by to apologize to us, a total of 8 times across them. frankly it creeped us out a bit. \n\nwhen our new steaks finally arrived, they sat them down saying \"here is your medium and rare filets\".  when we cut in to them, we did get 1 medium and 1 rare filet but 0 medium rare and 0 blue filets. we just accepted them and went forth. \n\n the flavor of the filets were good, as was the texture and seasoning. \n\nafter the steak disaster, i did not have to struggle to get another glass of wine fortunately!!\n\ni can't say the side of grits with cheese and bacon was all that great since it sat there getting cold and congealing the whole time they were figuring out the steak issue. \n\nwe passed on dessert, having lost all confidence on the restaurant. we did order a decaf coffee and a 10 year tawny port for me. the waiter offered to buy the port for me, i.e. comp it, but that seems a small consolation compared to blowing the whole main course in such an epic fashion. \n\ncan't recommend you avoid delmonico enough. with so many other options around here, don't risk wasting your hard earned dollar (or luckily won one) here.", 
            "<mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark> was the bomb.\n\nthey cook the steaks as precise as you could get for medium and medium rare lovers out there.  no need to temperature down when being asked in anticipation of the kitchen cooking the crap out of your steak, what you ask for is what you get.\n\ni was here was some buddies for a random vegas trip and we decided to do it big at delmonico.  the experience was great.  the ambiance is a little bit more on the \"date night\" side of the spectrum, but the service is awesome and the steaks and sides are delicious.  \n\nmake reservations and don't stress about the price, it's a special occasion.  even if it's not a special occasion, it will be when you steak comes at exactly the right temperature.", 
            "after a quick drink at public house, i was feeling pretty good, and hungry, and a little buzzed. here's how my conversation with our waiter began:\n\nme: \"what kind of bread is this?\"\nwaiter: \"they're popovers sir.\"\nme: \"has anyone ever commented that they're shaped like dicks?\" \nwaiter: \"haha, no sir, very good observation sir.\" \n\nyup, their popovers were pretty much shaped like dicks. they were a bit cold, oily, and combined with the refrigerated butter (one of my pet peeves at restaurants), a big disappointment. despite the phallic start to dinner, the rest of the meal and service was excellent. \n\nthe recommended <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> was a great way to cleanse my palate of that bread. there were big chunks of lobster meat and the bisque was well-seasoned without going overboard with the salt. delmonico is known for their <mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark> so i ordered that medium-rare. the steak was more on the medium side, but no complaints here as it was just as juicy and tender. no steak is complete without a side of <mark>Delmonico Creamed Spinach</mark>, which was done well. all sides are portioned to be shared. despite a misstep with my friend's order (bone-in ny strip instead of boneless), service was spot on.", 
            "great steak but disappointing service for the price.  went here for a friend's bachelor party.  we all got <mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark> medium rare (of course) with multiple sides and starters.  unfortunately, mine came out clearly at medium well.  which would be fine if i were not paying 50+ dollars to enjoy the wonderful dry-aged (etc., etc.) beef.  the steak still tasted good but not as great as it could have been.  i brought this to the attention of the waiter, who offered to bring me a new steak, but i did not wish to wait 15 minutes while my friends ate.  at the end of the meal, the waiter offered a free desert to make up for the steak, but we were all too full to enjoy one, so i declined.  no other offers were made to compensate for the overcooked steak (could have made any one of the drinks, appetizers or sides we ordered) and when the check arrived, the waiter had mistakenly added an extra bottle of wine to the tab (when brought to his attention, he removed it of course).  i know these are minor complaints, but having waited tables at much cheaper restaurants, i have found a way to make it up to a customer when mistakes were made.  i expect at least the same when a table is spending 400 dollars in your restaurant.  so all in all, the food was great, service good, but not up to par for the money you will spend.",

            "i cannot believe this place is rated anything less than 5 full stars.\n\ni have eaten steak dinners that cost twice as much, yet they cannot touch the <mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark> at delmonico's.  nyc steakhouses are shamed by this vegas institution.\n\nservice has always been impeccable.  the sides and apps are great (i like the steak tartar), but the <mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark> is the king of all steaks.\n\ni've been to vegas twice and to delmonico's twice.  it's the only place i insist friends visit when they go to vegas.  it's better than craps or blackjack!", 
            "located within restaurant row at the venetian, and still flying the banner of chef emeril lagasse under the direction of ronnie rainwater, it was at the behest of a friend that i returned to delmonico steakhouse on saturday afternoon and having contacted the kitchen in advance to be sure some dinner selections could be ordered during lunch the meal that followed was the sort of experience that left me scratching my head wondering why i'd not sat down at the restaurant in more than a half-dozen years, let alone why the space does not get the accolades it most certainly deserves.\n\nadmitting up front a fondness for emeril that stems from my first fine dining experience many years ago at his eponymous restaurant in orlando, not to mention several equally impressive visits to the celebrity chef's kitchens in las vegas and new orleans, it was mere moments after the restaurant's 11:30am opening that i checked in at the hostess stand and quickly led to a seat in the vast main dining area it was with exquisite service throughout that the afternoon would commence, visits from chef rainwater as well as the restaurant's gm and director of culinary operations sean roe helping to provide some background on sourcing, techniques, and their history with the man who made \"bam\" as much an ingredient as a phrase.\n\nrecently reinventing their logo and constantly tweaking a menu that features no lack of diversity to compliment several signatures, it was to two small popovers and a large bowl of truffled chips that the table was treated as menu decisions were made, and acknowledging that i knew the meal to be hosted even before sitting down a total of eighteen items were received, most of them self-selected, though a few were simply sent out.\n\ndining in an unfilled space as both the venetian and palazzo were without conventions on this rare weekend it was with somewhat jarring overhead tunes from the likes of the black keys, strokes, and arctic monkeys that the air above was filled and within fifteen minutes of placing our order the table was soon crowded with plates, a juicy and sizable steak burger brought to satisfy the table's youngest diner while the rest partook in silky duck liver with classic fruit and crispy bread accoutrements plus thick cuts of bacon that almost made the word look like a slight, each fork-tender bite supple without being fatty as brine was boldly balanced by root beer glaze reined in by pickled bits of watermelon rind.\n\ndeciding that a few seasonal plates as well as a classic would be best before progressing to entrees sure to be quite a bit more robust, it was with a light green salad alongside a fine riff on grilled cheese that round two began and with the <mark>Heirloom Tomato Soup</mark> as deep and vibrant as any in recent memory it's pairing to creamy ricotta on brioche was without doubt a hidden gem, the famous quartet of crustaceans every bit as snappy and smoky as remembered though the teensy biscuit still fails to make any sense.\n\nat this point ready and waiting for a <mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark> aged on premises for just short of 60-days it was quite the surprise when not only it, but also a piedmontese <mark>Bone-In New York Strip</mark> arrived, and with the desired earthy funk of the former bullet-pointed through the addition of butter the grassy wet-aged flavor of the piedmontese was a fork-tender study in bold contrast, both dinner-menu sides setting high standards for their respective ingredients as the crispy fried bird beneath finger-licking tomato glaze immediately stirred debate as to whether it was perhaps even better than that at nearby yardbird - a question that would make a great throwdown if the two restaurants could get sands corporation to set up such an event.\n\nnever once disappointed by dessert in an emeril establishment it was in one of those \"i'll take one of each\" menus that sweets were presented, but keeping in mind the days later eating and the fact that there were only three diners present a bit of restraint brought forth only five, the hefty application of whipped cream unfortunately muting the impact of key lime pie while both butter cake and cr\\u00e8me br\\u00fbl\\u00e9e were as rich as expected without doing much to challenge convention, the pecan pie and sweet potato donuts thus stepping into the spotlight as absolute must orders with the former almost devoid of filler as candied nuts melded with ice cream and caramel and the latter shockingly light at the center despite a shell as robust as that of the chicken, an aromatic autumnal taste rising high on the palate whether enjoyed on their own or dipped in espresso tinged foam.",

            "it is with a heavy heart, a disappointed palate, and an empty stomach that i write this review. at around 8:40pm on a wednesday like any other, an amazing 20 ounce <mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark> was murdered by the cooks at delmonico steakhouse in las vegas, nevada. a senseless, tragic loss really. \n\nthe ld: husband and i went for dinner. were seated immediately; had reservations. place was crowded; however, several tables were empty. servers (yes, plural; they employ a multi-function staff system) were friendly and knowledgeable. \n\nv&s for myself, beer for hub. both ordered the highly recommended in-house aged big ass ribeye; cooked med-rare please? add a side of asparagus. \n\ndrinks were delivered, as was a meh amuse bouche (didn't do much to invoke my appetite). while waiting on main course, we sat with empty drink glasses for approximately 15 minutes. \"yes, please, another round\" after flagging someone down.  \n\nthe highly anticipated steaks arrived. had so looked forward to dining (have been to delmonico in n'oleans and loved it) - salivating for the meat like pavlov's dog.\n\nhusband cut into his steak first and i awed at the perfection. beautifully cooked (i know my steak temps well and am quite skilled on the grill if i may say so; #humblebrag, but i do live in texas after all). i could immediately tell when my plate was sat down in front of me my steak was overcooked. i even whispered it to my spouse. sure enough, borderline well-done on the edges. i optimistically had hoped it would be less done toward the thicker center and toward the bone. nope.   \n\nwhen a waiter came to follow-up and ask how the steak was, i informed him mine...well, was not good. he did offer to refire; however, given the speed that my husband eats, and the amount of time it took the food to be delivered in the first place, i [foolishly] declined and stated that it was \"fine.\"\n\nmanagement comped one of the two tito's i ordered as an apology; however, this did little to suppress my internal sadness and the most amount of disappointment i'd had since losing my ars at the blackjack tables the night before. \n\nin all fairness, the staff at d's did try their best to accommodate. i probably should have allowed them a second chance to present a well-prepared piece of beef. it wasn't until i got home and found the $164 (w/out tip) receipt from the night in my wallet that i began to feel what can only be described as selfish-remorse (aka, sometimes referred to as \"buyer's remorse\").\n\nso after a few days of ruminating (as females are sometimes known to do), i called the restaurant and told them i regretted my decisions and to thank them for at least attempting to \"satisfy the customer.\" without any provocation, the manager offered to send me a gift card for $50 to cover a steak during my next visit. i, of course, did not expect the offer, but happily provided my mailing address. \n\ni have found that an unfortunate outcome of many \"celebrity\" chef restaurants opening in lv is that the quality of both service and food suffer. it's the nature of sin city and the abundance of tourism - people from all over the world with very different palates - some more or less discerning than others. :'(  \n\nso, now i have a gc that i can redeem at any of emeril's establishments. i doubt i'll be using it at delmonico in vegas baby, because frankly i've left the building and think i'll stick to d's in the big easy. sin city killed the beefy magic for me. cheers!\n\n[151 in 2015]",

            "i rarely write reviews, even though i rely on yelp very heavily for my restaurant selections! it's usually just because nothing overwhelmed me, or i was too lazy to do so - i'm trying to be better about that! my husband and i went to las vegas last week for our first year anniversary to get a way for a few days. we always try and scout out new restaurants. this was definitely our favorite meal - hands down! the entire experience was great -- they brought out a small treat for us to start, then we both had amazing bourbon cocktails, and then dove into the delicious food. i got the <mark>Filet Mignon</mark>, but prepared piedmontese style which is just seasoning, olive oil, roasted garlic, and rosemary - it was cooked perfectly (medium) and super tender and had great flavoring. it didn't need any sauce! my husband got the <mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark> which they are known for i believe - i had a few bites and it was fantastic. the au gratin potatoes were also good and not overly heavy like some can be. our wine was great as well, stag's leap. the best part of the experience though was our waiter rene. he was so attentive, fun to talk to, and just wanted us to enjoy ourselves. he really made this experience special. i also have some dietary restrictions and i've never seen a restaurant be so attentive to them. it really put me at ease. next time you're in vegas, go here. we'll be returning for new year's this year and have already recommended it to some friends going out later this month!",

            "the gist:   the most expensive steak does not equal the best tasting steak.     \n\nplayed in vegas with a group of 8 other friends.  even though there is so much good food to choose from in vegas, all of us knew we wanted to go to a nice place for some good steak during our stay.    we've heard a lot of good things about delmonico so it was pretty easy decision to try it out.   \n\nfirst things first.  service was great.   we came late for our reservation.  no problem.   some of us actually shared a couple steaks.  no problem.   took pictures for us during a busy saturday night.  no problem.\n\nthe important thing - the steak.   with 8 people around the table we were able to try various cuts.   several guys got the bone-in rib eye.   one of the girls got the rib-eye, and i personally shared the <mark>Bone-In New York Strip</mark> with a friend.    i feel like i'm paying a premium for vegas and/or emeril.     don't get me wrong, you'll definitely get a nice fat, juicy, flavorful steak here.     but i felt like i was getting more of my money's worth with the kona crusted steak at capital grille (chicago) or the cowboy cut at taste of texas (houston).    the meat quality was much better and believe it or not, much more flavorful than delmonico's steaks.\n\nthat being said, if you do go to dominico's, definitely get the sautee'd mushrooms on the side.   its a nice garlicky mix of mushrooms that compliments perfectly with the steaks!",

            "located within restaurant row at the venetian, and still flying the banner of chef emeril lagasse under the direction of ronnie rainwater, it was at the behest of a friend that i returned to delmonico steakhouse on saturday afternoon and having contacted the kitchen in advance to be sure some dinner selections could be ordered during lunch the meal that followed was the sort of experience that left me scratching my head wondering why i'd not sat down at the restaurant in more than a half-dozen years, let alone why the space does not get the accolades it most certainly deserves.\n\nadmitting up front a fondness for emeril that stems from my first fine dining experience many years ago at his eponymous restaurant in orlando, not to mention several equally impressive visits to the celebrity chef's kitchens in las vegas and new orleans, it was mere moments after the restaurant's 11:30am opening that i checked in at the hostess stand and quickly led to a seat in the vast main dining area it was with exquisite service throughout that the afternoon would commence, visits from chef rainwater as well as the restaurant's gm and director of culinary operations sean roe helping to provide some background on sourcing, techniques, and their history with the man who made \"bam\" as much an ingredient as a phrase.\n\nrecently reinventing their logo and constantly tweaking a menu that features no lack of diversity to compliment several signatures, it was to two small popovers and a large bowl of truffled chips that the table was treated as menu decisions were made, and acknowledging that i knew the meal to be hosted even before sitting down a total of eighteen items were received, most of them self-selected, though a few were simply sent out.\n\ndining in an unfilled space as both the venetian and palazzo were without conventions on this rare weekend it was with somewhat jarring overhead tunes from the likes of the black keys, strokes, and arctic monkeys that the air above was filled and within fifteen minutes of placing our order the table was soon crowded with plates, a juicy and sizable steak burger brought to satisfy the table's youngest diner while the rest partook in silky duck liver with classic fruit and crispy bread accoutrements plus thick cuts of bacon that almost made the word look like a slight, each fork-tender bite supple without being fatty as brine was boldly balanced by root beer glaze reined in by pickled bits of watermelon rind.\n\ndeciding that a few seasonal plates as well as a classic would be best before progressing to entrees sure to be quite a bit more robust, it was with a light green salad alongside a fine riff on grilled cheese that round two began and with the <mark>Heirloom Tomato Soup</mark> as deep and vibrant as any in recent memory it's pairing to creamy ricotta on brioche was without doubt a hidden gem, the famous quartet of crustaceans every bit as snappy and smoky as remembered though the teensy biscuit still fails to make any sense.\n\nat this point ready and waiting for a <mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark> aged on premises for just short of 60-days it was quite the surprise when not only it, but also a piedmontese <mark>Bone-In New York Strip</mark> arrived, and with the desired earthy funk of the former bullet-pointed through the addition of butter the grassy wet-aged flavor of the piedmontese was a fork-tender study in bold contrast, both dinner-menu sides setting high standards for their respective ingredients as the crispy fried bird beneath finger-licking tomato glaze immediately stirred debate as to whether it was perhaps even better than that at nearby yardbird - a question that would make a great throwdown if the two restaurants could get sands corporation to set up such an event.\n\nnever once disappointed by dessert in an emeril establishment it was in one of those \"i'll take one of each\" menus that sweets were presented, but keeping in mind the days later eating and the fact that there were only three diners present a bit of restraint brought forth only five, the hefty application of whipped cream unfortunately muting the impact of key lime pie while both butter cake and cr\\u00e8me br\\u00fbl\\u00e9e were as rich as expected without doing much to challenge convention, the pecan pie and sweet potato donuts thus stepping into the spotlight as absolute must orders with the former almost devoid of filler as candied nuts melded with ice cream and caramel and the latter shockingly light at the center despite a shell as robust as that of the chicken, an aromatic autumnal taste rising high on the palate whether enjoyed on their own or dipped in espresso tinged foam.", 
            "of all steakhouse experiences, this is the best. i have enjoyed many steaks at delmonico steak house. tonight was perfect. \ni enjoyed a <mark>Bone-In New York Strip</mark> served piedmontese. my steak was cooked impeccably. executive sous chef ivan rojas prepared a meal my wife and i truly appreciated. \nwe have been customers here for 5 years now. \ni was raised in the restaurant industry, and i truly appreciate the effort involved to create our meal."

            "delmonico's is one of those few luxurious establishments in which can be hit or miss. on some nights i've received some of the finest steak i've ever had with some decent service to go along with it. often times, i feel like i deal with waitresses / hostesses who seem to act as if their menu is one of the greatest things about vegas, which they are sadly mistaken. i've noticed their wine list is impeccable and their decor is really what makes this place scream \"fine dining.\" but sadly because of subpar service and outrageous prices ($51 for <mark>Filet Mignon</mark>, 8 oz), its simply fine dining that isn't so fine.", 
            "i really wasn't aware that this restaurant is emeril's place until i looked it up on msn.com.  in any case, i was dying to taste ribeye in every restaurant and since this place was highly touted as being one of the best in vegas, i had to go here.\n\nso surprise, surprise, i ordered the rib-eye.  my wife ordered the <mark>Filet Mignon</mark>.  my impression before we received our dishes was that this was an upscale place so we were expecting meats on the level of ruth's chris steakhouse.  i was slightly disappointed in that their rib-eye, although good, i felt was only slightly better than a black angus steak.  i've had a much better tasting rib-eye from smitty's in pasadena.  the filet was nice and tender so that was the bright spot during our dinner date.  we also ordered a couple of glasses of cab and so it complemented our steaks very well.\n\nthe service was, as you would come to expect, excellent.  if it wasn't for the rib-eye, which was lacking some flavor, i would've given it a 5-star rating.", 
            "one of the most all-time memorable dining experiences i've ever had.  \n\nthough i am vegetarian now, my mouth *still* waters at the thought of the <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> i had at delmonico's.  it was simply unrivaled by any other steak i've ever had and probably any other steak i ever will have.  i sincerely doubt that in my life i will ever -- ever -- have a better steak.  it was perfectly cooked, and coated with the perfect amount of pepper and spices on all sides.  \n\nsecondly, but certainly not any less impressive, was the ceasar salad.  as somebody who orders ceasar salad everywhere she goes, i would venture to say that this was in the top three i've ever had -- i could probably even safely say it was the best.  served with whole leaves, which i love, and the dressing was made at our table, right in front of our eyes.\n\ncannot be beat.", 
            "food: definitely one of the best steakhouses i have ever been to....you're getting quality good meat and service here.  i tried the <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> which was delicious and tasty. i also tried a side of potatoes and string beans which was also great. also the soup of the day: black bean and roasted pork was to die for!tasted just like homemade chili!also the trio of homemade ice cream was wonderful.\n\nservice: service here is outstanding. the waiters are very prompt and professional.\n\nlocation: located in the venetian\n\natmosphere: loved it, very relaxing and intimate.\n\nprice: expensive, but not too bad considering the quality and quantity of food.", 
            "i blame my father for my inordinate love of all things gourmet. thankfully, i appreciate a good burrito as much as i appreciate a good steak, but i will definitely seize every opportunity to dine in style as much as i can.\n\nthanks to a family trip to vegas, i got to eat at emeril's, once more partaking our family's favorite pasttime: eating. we had eaten at the original location in new orleans when i lived there, and it was one of my top 5 dining experiences of all time. this one definitely tied that experience.\n\nas other people have said, if you're not going to eat steak in some form when you come here, you're wasting your time. the steak is truly a peak experience for meat lovers. we all ate our  steaks in silence, save for the \"omg!\" and \"mmmm!\" and \"wow.wow.wow.\"  they all had the <mark>Filet Mignon</mark>, and i had the bone-in dry aged ribeye: the best steak i have ever eaten in my life. it came on a bed of perfectly creamy garlic mashed potatoes and <mark>Pan Seared <mark>Foie Gras</mark></mark> butter just melting into it. \n\nhave you ever had lightly tempura battered asparagus? it's worth coming here just to try them. \n\neven the sides- delicious spinach he made without cream that was still good (shocking, i know), and broccoli cooked to perfection...we all kept remarking how absolutely everything was just perfect.\n\nthe other thing that distinguishes restaurants like this is the service.  places like this are in a whole other league- waiters who seem to read your mind, appearing and disappearing before you even realized you needed something - never interrupting conversation, never hovering, always classy and helpful. our waiter chose the perfect wine for us with with the vague descriptions of what we were looking for, and it truly was the best complement to our meals ever. \n\nthe design of the room is also a refreshing breath of fresh air from all the gaudy glitz and obnoxious 'bigness' of vegas; simple, clean lines and understated elegance and chairs that make it seem like your table is totally self-contained and isolated from the other tables. great to have that feeling of privacy.\n\nwe lingered for hours just basking in the glow of such perfection and decadence.", 
            "i went in with high expectations.  \nthe service was what i had expected, they were very attentive and were on top of our needs throughout our meal.  our waiters were great!  we sat down, water was brought over very quickly, as did the little \"wonton\" topped with kalamata olives and proscuitto thing.  i wasn't very impressed by it, i guzzled my water.  by the time i looked up again, my water had been refilled.  wow!  the waiter brought our bread and explained the menu.  then she let us be to ponder upon her words.  i chose the scallops with creamed corn sauce.  they scallops were cooked perfectly and the corn chower had lobster in it!  it was 7 minutes in heaven!  the mister and i both opted for steak.  he has the <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> and i had the bone-in ny strip.  we decided to share a twice <mark>Baked Idaho Potato</mark> with cheese and bacon.  his filet was just a filet.  my ny was huge!  if i had known it was going to be so large, i would have gotten a filet too.  i was only able to eat half of mine and was not able to have any potato.  the mister finished his steak and all the potato plus his bread which i didn't touch.  the steaks were cooked med-rare perfectly and seasoned.  i could have done without any seasoning on it but hey, that's how they came.  it wasn't ovewhemling in spices but enough that i didn't need any sauces besides the delicious butter just melting so erotically on the plate.  i was stuffed full of steak but i needed to satiate my sweet tooth.  we shared a pecan pie which came with a mound of ice cream.  the crust was absolutely fantastic and the pecans were not burnt.  we had no wine because we were just too dehydrated from the heat, water was all we needed.  i think the mister was slightly disappointed that his <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> wasn't as tender as the kobe steaks he is used to.  oh well!  i enjoyed my steak and i enjoyed being tended to like a princess.  i had a great night, it would have been better if the darn tables weren't' so close together.  i would have given it 5 stars, i just didn't like being able to hear what the people next to me were whispering about.  the prices were fairly reasonable for vegas, we've spent double at yamashiro's and redondo beach pier, plenty of times.\n\ndon't let the dress code fool you too much.  there were so many people in there wearing jeans and shorts, i felt a bit over dressed in a cocktail dress and he was wearing a dress shirt and slacks.  the restaurant looked semi-formal, the people there were looking mighty touristy so the ambiance was slightly off.", 
            "we were at delmonico's last year to celebrate my boyfriend's sister's 21st birthday. that meant there were a lot of us! the atmosphere was awesome, but then again, every restaurant in vegas has some degree of nice ambiance, right? anyhow, our large party wasn't able to sit together, which really sucked because we had made reservations and they expected all of us at that time. so, my boyfriend, me and his two cousins got our own mini-table. we all shared the <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> prepared table-side. it was seriously enough for all 4 of us, and it was very very delicious. i ordered the gumbo, and was very disappointed. i thought that gumbo would be emeril's thing! it was slightly cold and way too salty. it was a nice little presentation though-- it came in a mini-pot and was poured into my bowl. \n\ni had the <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> and it was okay, and i wish i had ordered the duck. i can't really say why i only thought the <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> was only okay, but maybe it had to do with the fact that it was pretty salty too and i had just finished up a super salty gumbo? \n\nall in all, it was a fun experience because of the atmosphere and because all of the family was there. would we have had just a good of a time had we gone somewhere else? probably. but, this was birthday girl's choice and it was kinda fun to go to a celebrity chef's place and criticize their food. :)", 
            "delmonico, the trivia first. \ndelmonico doesn't have emeril lagasse's name on it, however it is his establishment. word is he signed a contract with mgm properties so no other place on the strip can use his name outside of the mgm properties. the only mention you will see is his first name mentioned in the dessert selection, other than that nothing.\n\nthe atmosphere is nice and the waiter service is killer. however the food was lacking, the steak although cooked to perfection lacked some flavor and they do not mention how large the steaks are. thepetit <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> was tiny, six ounces for sixty dollars which included three overcooked shrimp lobster topped. \n\nthe frog legs were good, a different for once and their selection of fine drinks is a good selection.", 
            "boyfriend and i came here with two other friends as an early bday celebration!\n\nthe restaurant is right next to the passageway to the palazzo hotel and it sits right in front of the blue man theater. the ambience was nice except i took off a star for the boring cream colored walls. \n\nthe food was great! i had a <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> while the other three all had a bone in ribeye. ohmigosh...i couldn't believe how big these things were! they were ginormous! anyway, the sides were yummy! we had the <mark>Sauted Garlic Mushrooms</mark>, steamed asparagus, <mark>Baked Idaho Potato</mark>, <mark>Truffle and Parmesan Potato Chips</mark>, and spinach! geez...i know we couldn't even get to all of them!\n\ntheir famous banana cream pie was delicious! it was a little frozen...i prefer it to be a bit more thawed...but it was still good!\n\ntheir dinner rolls..ok...this is so filipino but damn..it tasted like hot pan-de-sal! it was so good! hahaha...seriously. emeril's gotta be stealing goldilock's or valerio's pandesal recipe! \n\n$400 for the 4 of us....it's alright...step outside and play roulette! make sure you put it all on red!", 
            "this is my 2nd emeril restaurant experience, first is nola and i loved it.  it's only getting 4 stars because my lobster was a little too salty.  but, the preparation of it has been the best that i have ever had. it was so tender and succulent.  i would definitely order it again, but would remind them to please not salt it so much.  everything that i ate that night was to perfection.  the salad, the appetizer, <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> and lobster.  our server was also very nice and very on top of servicing our every needs.  the wine that he recommended paired extremely well with our meal.  \n\nyes, the walls are cream colored.  but it's a very clean, fresh feel.  the table are nice and roomy.  the chairs are so big and comfortable, you can sit there for hours enjoying your meal and drinks.  the accent colors in there are a tuscan red, so imagine a nice warm, bright feel.  i really enjoyed it.  plus it's vegas, who doesn't hit the lounge or clubs afterwards for the dark, moody ambiance.", 
            "tip on ordering steak:\nif you want a bigger cut of meat, get it rare to medium-rare.  \notherwise, if you order your meat medium-well, you get a smaller cut in order for it to cook well in the middle\n\ni couldn't decide on a steak that night, and i wanted a little variety.  so i ordered a combination of 2 appetizers and a soup.\n\nsoup: <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> was awesome mainly because they weren't stingy with the lobster meat.  often when you order a seafood soup (e.g. clam chowder) they dump a lot of potatoes or other filling in there.  not the case with this bisque.  a must for any bisque or lobster connoisseur.\n\nappetizer 1: <mark>Butternut Squash Ravioli</mark> w/duck was very tasty, and again, not stingy with the duck, which kind of looked like pulled pork but with duck meat.\n\nappetizer 2: crawfish meat w/crystal pepper sauce over linguine could have been a small meal in itself.  and just the right amount of that crystal hot sauce to give it a solid southern kick.  this was probably my favorite.\n\ni did have a taste of the various meats too including the t-bone and <mark>Filet Mignon</mark>, both of which i recommend.  you don't get anything with it, so unless you just want meat, you'll probably need to order a side dish or two.", 
            "incredible service! made a reservation even though it was after 4th of july weekend. i was glad we had one, it was still packed on a monday night! there were eight of us, my friend's daughter brought her new build a bear puppy, and the server brought a setting and high chair for the puppy! how cute is that?? we ordered a bunch of appetizers, the fried calamari was light and crisp, bbq shrimp's sauce was thick and sweet but yet savory, <mark>Creole Boiled Gulf Shrimp Cocktail</mark> should be named prawn cocktail, and the <mark>Butternut Squash Ravioli</mark> - again, it's the sauce that did it, yum. every time i see <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark>, i order it for the kids, they love it - creamy, velvety with chunks of lobsters. hubby had the ribeye steak, i had the <mark>Filet Mignon</mark>, took a bite of my friends' beef medallion and <mark>Colorado Rack of Lamb</mark>. i think the ribeye steak and lamb came out the winner. very juicy and tender, with a little bit burnt on the fat, perfection! we shared the banana cream pie, banana pudding, creme brulee for desserts. the pudding was no doubt the winner, the others are good, but if you can only order one, have the pudding. again, expensive, but money well spent. will come back again for sure!", 
            "las vegas...i have so many unforgettable memories...\n\ni first came to this sin city on a cold winter night with my college roommates.  the youngest of us had just turned 21 and we needed to prove we were adults.  back then, new york new york was the hottest hotel on the strip and we went crazy, imitating diana ross and the supremes (i would say we were the original \"dreamgirls\" and i have pictures to prove it).  we couldn't afford a lobster for each person, so we shared 1 among 4 of us. we were young, naive, dirt poor and shameless.  \n\nsummer in vegas is a miserable time, and my sisters and i braved that heat by looking at the bellagio water fountain in awe.  that water show is still the favorite part of my trip every time i go to vegas.  of course, this all happened before \"ocean's eleven\" featured that famous last scene.  i don't think we looked as cool as brad and george though...\n\ni swore to myself that i'd never be back to this city after our incident at a club.  we got kicked out for having too much fun!!!  it was for a bachelorette party, and i think paris hilton was slightly jealous because we drew more crowd than her performance on that night.  we continued to party on in our suite and i discovered that night that jacuzzi could make even the most prude girl hot and steamy!!!\n\ni am no longer young nor have enough energy to party all night, but vegas proved to be a great place to have some of the finest dining experiences one can enjoy.  this time, our sole purpose of the trip was to eat at delmonico steakhouse, and what a fantastic night we had!!!\n\nsome of us had been here before, so the night started with the chef's complimentary appetizer which was a capane of smoke salmon on puff pastry.  a bottle of red wine was chosen from their extensive wine list along with fried calamari and <mark>Emeril's New Orleans Barbecue Shrimp</mark> as appetizers.  i can't make a comment on the wine, but the calamari had overwhelming amount of olives for my taste.  i did love the shrimp as they were cooked perfectly in that tangy sweet bbq sauce.\n\nsome of us were disappointed that the restaurant no longer offered <mark>Double Cut Kurobuta Pork Chop</mark>, but the special of the night was pork tenderloin with braised bacon, and they happily opted for it.  a couple of us ordered a bone in filet, the bf ordered a bone in ribeye and i got a <mark>Filet Mignon</mark>.  my butterflied medium steak was perfectly charred outside with some pink inside and it was very tender and juicy.  i tasted the pork dish and i loved every part of it.  i never knew that a chunk of bacon could be so buttery and sweet, and the cane syrup they used to braise was just perfect for that white fatty meat.  the highlight of the night was the bone in ribeye.  that thing was huge with so much flavor!!!  i rarely eat any pink meat, but the bf's medium rare steak was so delicious i didn't care for the color of it.  seriously, if you ever get a chance to go to delmonico, get their bone in ribeye.  you'll thank me forever for the best steak ever!!!\n\nwe also ordered sauteed garlic mushroom and <mark>Roasted Fingerling Potatoes</mark>.  it was a mushroom heaven with all different kinds of them (shiitake, button, oyster, portebello, etc) cooked in chopped garlic and the aroma itself could make someone's mouth watery.  those purple, yellow and red potatoes side dish was recommended by our maitre d' and it didn't disappoint us.  maybe it could be too heavy for a light eater with all that meat, but for a person like me (a meat & potato girl), i couldn't ask for a better meal.\n\ni must say this steakhouse is a place to impress someone.  it's a huge restaurant, but since it was sectioned into 3 different rooms, it rather felt intimate and quaint.  small tables were cornered so you could be private and although the restaurant was busy, i never felt rushed.  the waiters were not those friendly joker types, but the service we received was more than adequate and appropriate.  \n\ndelmonico renewed my faith in vegas.  i was impressed...i was happy...i was glad to be back to vegas where i have the good, the bad and the ugly memories of my \"peak\" time!  this dining experience (not just the food) tops as one of my favorite moments in vegas.", 
            "if you want a 5-star food experience, then follow these simple instructions:\n\norder the bone-in <mark>Filet Mignon</mark>, sauteed <mark>Sauted Garlic Mushrooms</mark>, <mark>Truffle and Parmesan Potato Chips</mark>.... trust me, your mouth will thank me.\n\nand yes, the mushrooms <mark>Truffle and Parmesan Potato Chips</mark> will still taste damn good as a post-partying 3am snack.  just use the chips to scoop up the mushrooms and go to town on 'em.\n\nhappy eating & you're welcome!!\n\noh, and i think the link on yelp is wrong... try this one:\nhttp://www.emerils.com/restaurant/5/delmonico-steakhouse/",

            "absolutely loved everything about this place.  my party of 6 chose this establishment to have our new year's eve dinner and the restaurant did not disappoint.  we were 20 minutes late for our 8:30pm reservation since we were stuck trying to squeeze through the nye crowd from 2 hotels down.  the host didn't think anything of it and was able to seat us right away.\n\ni had ordered the <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> and shared the side of the perfectly steamed and <mark>Buttered Fresh Asparagus</mark> that could serve up to 4 people.  i ordered my filet medium rare and it was definitely medium rare as our helpful and attentive waiter, ryan, had described it.  the other dishes my dining companions had were the pepper-seared <mark>Ahi Tuna</mark>, grilled petite beef medallions, and spicy jumbo shrimp with fresh fettucine pasta.  all of which they loved.  \n\nthe dessert lovers shared the warm apple crisp and the chocolate brioche bread pudding.  it was the first chocolate bread pudding i had and once i dug into the soft center, i fell in love....\n\nat the end of dinner, not having a calculator, ryan noticed i was struggling a bit to calculate everyone's portion of the bill and he kindly offered to split the bill 6 ways as i had specified to make things easier.... how nice was that?!  excellent food, excellent service - highly recommend dining here.", 
            "the past few visits to the venetian hotel i've made it a point to eat at demonico's. the service is impeccable, waiters remove plates the second you are finished and they are very approachable. the most recent trip i had the braised pork appetizer w/cranberry, creole mustard and basil which was delicious. the entree consisted of the charbroiled bone-in <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> with roasted root vegetables, <mark>Roasted Fingerling Potatoes</mark> and jumbo onion rings. very fun. thanks to hector, my server, everything arrived on time and well prepared.", 
            "bam!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\nemeril has done good!\n\nits located in the venetian casino level on restaurant row on the way to the palazzo. the place has a cute bar area where we had to wait for the rest of our party but eventually the hostess sat us first. we had to sit at 2 seperate tables because we had 13people but they didnt charge gratuity...although we gave more regardless...\n\nfrom the start our server was beyond nice and welcoming. he helped ben choose his martini, he helped me and a friend chose our red wine which was yummy and we devoured our calamari, <mark>Filet Mignon</mark>, bonein ribeye, <mark>Truffle and Parmesan Potato Chips</mark> and mushrooms!!!\n\nthe bread they bring out one by one on your plate was so soft, warm and goooood with the butter, calamari was wonderful even with olives (which im not a big fan of) it was yummy, the <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> was cooked well all the way around perfectly seasoned. the ribeye was a real winner though super yummmy and hugge (obviously hence the place being called delmonico...). the mushrooms were perfect and the <mark>Truffle and Parmesan Potato Chips</mark> were delish altho a little too greasy for me. \n\nalll the food runners and our server was so nice and the atmosphere like many steakhouses wasnt stuck up but actually really relaxed while still being rather nice. at the end he asked us where we were heading and suggested many different places to check out even tho we were so picky on tryin to decide which bar to head too. he also brought out two desserts with a candle for the two bday boys at our table!\n\nat the end our table of 6 had a bill of near $450  (5 of us got filet or ribeye $45-$55) ben f and i ate $190 worth hahahah it was a wonderful meal...in a wonderful atmosphere! check it out when in need of a fabulous steak + great wine.", 
            "besides having to finance your meal with a 20% deposit, this is the best steak and lamb my wife and i have ever had. the <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> was ridiculously tender and perfectly seasoned. you do not have to put any salt or pepper on anything. the lamb was even better and the portions were huge (9 oz filet and 2 lamb racks). we started with a lump crab cake which had a dill caper sauce that was amazing. to give you an idea of what we spent, we got an appetizer (crab cake), two cocktails, <mark>Filet Mignon</mark>, lamb with truffle oil, side of potatoes (everything is al a carte so sides you get separately family style) was $150 without tip. expensive i know, but i guess that's vegas; $6 waters, and $100 market price lobster. \n\nthe only downside is that this place is loud!!! the way the ceilings and the rooms are built noise just bounces around so if you are looking for a quiet romantic dinner, i wouldn't go here. if you are looking for the best steak of your life, this is a great place. \n\na couple rounds of blackjack might help you pay for you meal. i probably wouldn't eat here again... at least until i save up over next 30 years. good luck! :)", 
            "this was my third time at an emeril restaurant, and once again i left feeling that paying $85 to eat dinner was perfectly justified.\n\nappetizer: the <mark>Traditional New Orleans Gumbo</mark>.  smokey, spicy, warm, and comforting.  \n\nentree: <mark>Filet Mignon</mark>, medium.  crusted with just the right amount of spices, cooked to perfection, and crowned with a healthy pat of herb butter.  \n\nside dish: <mark>Country Smashed Potatoes</mark>.  clearly filled with more butter and cream than i care to think about, skins left in (love that), and just melt-in-your-mouth delicious.  \n\nmy friend's side dish: bacon & cheese grits.  i normally don't like grits, but these were nice and well...gritty, not runny or gloppy.  add bacon and cheese...c'mon.   \n\ndessert: the best part of the meal.  wait--probably the best part of my entire vegas trip.  warm pecan pie with an oatmeal shortbread cookie crust, topped with homemade vanilla ice cream and caramel sauce.  just...wow.  the pecans were chopped into manageable pieces, the filling was not overly thick and cloying, and i could have eaten the crust by itself and been happy.  i had a taste of my friend's chocolate bread pudding, which was gooey and intensely chocolatey, but not too sweet.  (it tasted like a combo of semi-sweet & bittersweet.)\n\ndrinks: pretty good.  they don't have a specialty cocktail list since they are very into being a traditional steakhouse, but my pineapple martini was nice.  \n\ndecor: very bare bones- the plain beige walls have no art on them, but that allows you to notice the very ornate architecture of the place, with high ceilings and arches everywhere.  i was too into my food to really care what it looked like though.\n\nservice: as always with emeril's restaurants- impeccable.  we had no less than 3 people taking care of us at all times: one to take our orders, one to bring our food, and one to take it away.  \n\ntip: share an entree.  i split the 9.5 oz. <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> with my friend and i'm glad i did.  the average portion is enough for 2 or 3 people.", 
            "went here for our first dinner as a married couple in vegas, and we dropped some decent dough, but it was worth every penny.\n\nstarted with the calamari which was unbelivable.  cooked perfectly and the olive salad on top was fantastic.\n\nbest <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> i have ever eaten, hands down.\n\ni also highly recommend springing for the <mark>Sauted Garlic Mushrooms</mark>.  it is a bunch of exotic mushrooms seasoned and sauteed perfectly.  we also had the <mark>Country Smashed Potatoes</mark> and the <mark>Delmonico Creamed Spinach</mark>, both delicious.\n\nfinished off with creme brulee which was decent.  i expected better for the dessert after the fabulous meal.\n\ndon't get me wrong, dinner was not cheap, but it was fantastic.  the whole dining experience was great.", 
            "the steakhouse is like most traditional steakhouses. the decor was very clean and contemporary. the hostesses weren't all that attractive and would rate about a 5-6 in my scale of looks and their demeanor looked as if they did not really care to be there at all. \n\nthe dining area is half filled with patrons and business people alike chatting away about their day and how excellent the steak was prepared the beautiful burgundy high leather chairs is a nice touch and their seating area is plush and soft. the booth seating is a high suede sofa like seating and the tables were all lined with clean white linens and set in standard of most fine dining establishments. \n\ni took my seat and i was greeted by the waiter and the captain and was asked about my choice of entree. i decided to go with their <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> and go with my good instincts that this would be the best choice. the chef prepared all the appetizers for a sampling. classic jumbo <mark>Creole Boiled Gulf Shrimp Cocktail</mark>, <mark>Truffle and Parmesan Potato Chips</mark>, classic <mark>Caesar Salad</mark>, fried calamari, and mixed green salad. \n\nthe classic jumbo <mark>Creole Boiled Gulf Shrimp Cocktail</mark> with a extremely spicy cocktail sauce wasn't as good as i expected. the shrimp were cooked well and the shrimp were presented beautifully, however, the spicy cocktail sauce did not please my taste buds or my nostrils for that matter. the sauce was like eating a handful of wasabi.\n\n the extremely addicting <mark>Truffle and Parmesan Potato Chips</mark> were excellent and should be ordered every time any patron enters this restaurant. the chips were drizzled with truffle oils and shaved parmesan cheese and each individual chip melted as you put them in your mouth. \n\nthe classic <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> had much to desire. the way the salad was prepared was not my idea of a good salad. it was literally a huge chunk of romaine lettuce with the heart in tact served with a plain and unappealing caesar dressing. i don't like how fancy restaurants can slap a big chunk of romaine lettuce on a plate and call it a classic <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> just to be different. don't mess with a good thing!\n\nthe fried calamari was ok at best, not my favorite but definitely worth a taste. the mixed green salad was a way a salad should be prepared and had just the right amount of dressing. the waiter was attentive and knew what drinks were ordered. the plates were cleared but seemed like sometimes dead plates were left around. not a good sign of service. \n\nthe entree finally came and the presentation could have been better but the filet was ammmmazing. the steak knife cut through the filet like a butter knife through room temperature butter. the steak was cooked to medium rare perfectly and encrusted with some new orleans style spices. i truly enjoyed the filet till the very last bite. one thing i do have to mention is the dessert. i would highly recommend the famous emeril's banana cake. this thing was pure heaven and was absolutely delicious. i could not even describe it in words if i even tried so i won't! so you will have to try it for yourself. \n\noverall the experience was good, food was good but not the best i have tried, and the service was ok by my standards, but my standards can be high. my favorite parts were the filet and the dessert, the appetizers once again could have been better with the exception of the <mark>Truffle and Parmesan Potato Chips</mark>, mmm! delicious! i would recommend this place for dinner or lunch, however, the price can be a little daunting. i was calculating the totals of a appetizer, entree, and dessert and was estimating about 70-100 dollars a person with tip. that can look a little scary for some people, but for the meal and experience i'd say that was definitely worth it! many thanks for reading. till next time.", 
            "we went here on our one date night of our vacation to vegas. it was everything we could have wished for and more. \n\nwe had the bbq shrimp as an appetizer, shared a salad, he had the rib eye steak and i the <mark>Filet Mignon</mark>. both of the steaks melted in our mouths. i have never had a steak do that, and i have had a lot of steaks in my time. we had the <mark>Country Smashed Potatoes</mark> and steamed asparagus as sides. the steamed asparagus was nothing new, but the potatoes... oh my, they were good. they were like au gratin potatoes with mozzarella cheese. yummo. \n\nby the time we were done with all of that, sadly, we did not have room for dessert, but that didn't leave us leaving unhappy... it was quite a lovely experience.", 
            "being that i am in real estate, i can't tell you how excited i was to be treated to a chi-chi expensive dinner that probably ended up costing the equivalent to what i budget for two weeks of groceries...per person, mind you!\n\ni was in town for a work conference and one of our clients was gracious enough to invite all of his brokers to dinner. \n\ni'm not much of a carnivore but..when in rome! it would be plain dumb of me to choose fish in a place known for their steak. that would be like ordering a hamburger at a chinese restaurant.\n\nhere's the nitty gritty:\n\nstarter: \n<mark>Caesar Salad</mark> (made table side for 2): shared w/ my co-worker. best damn <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> i've ever had! they even mix the dressing fresh.\n\nmain entree:\n<mark>Filet Mignon</mark> - medium rare: i think i died and went to beef heaven. so tender. so perfectly seasoned. so perfectly cooked! i'd be tempted to convert to carnivor-ism if i could eat like this more often.\n\nsides (a la carte):\nwe ordered a bunch for the table to share family style\n<mark>Delmonico Creamed Spinach</mark> - yum-o in my tum-o\nsauteed <mark>Sauted Garlic Mushrooms</mark> - shroomerific\n<mark>Truffle and Parmesan Potato Chips</mark> - the classiest chips on the block & a hit at the table. we fought over the chip with the most truffles.\n\ndessert (again, shared family style):\nbutterscotch pudding - not to sweet - just right but a taste was enough for me.\nchocolate brioche bread pudding - i liked all the layers and it wasn't overly rich \n\nthe service was absolutely impeccable. water glasses were never allowed to go half empty - they were promptly refilled by super observant waiters with bottled water in hand. whenever someone left their chair to use the restroom, they came back to their napkin, neatly refolded and they'll pull your chair out for you to sit.\n\ni've never seen a more professional or attentive group - and that in itself justifies their high prices.\n\ncome here and dine like royalty!", 
            "delmonico in las vegas by emeril lagasse is not as impressive as i would expect it would be. first we are given a really lousy table in the corner as if my husband has been very bad that he deserve to be punished in the corner(considering this is his special day-b-day). waiters are clueless, they are just standing in the middle but most of the time really doing nothing that in few ocassions i have to pour my own wine in my glass. the head waiter is the only one who seems to be working and who do know what to do here.\n            we are given a small apetizer courtesy of the chef bec of my husbands b-day which is a good touch, i love this little appetizer (not in the menu, wish it was there because that would be the only highlight of the evening) a concoction of smoke chicken with couscous with a little spices, the taste is all balance and in harmony.\n           the fried green tomatoes appetizer is bland, whatever coating and sauce they put in there didnt help at all.  the spinach and raddichio salad is soaked on its own dressing which you cannot even tell which dressing it is, salads when presented are supposed to be crisp, so make sure you only put the dressing when it is ready to be eaten, very disappointing since the head weater gladly recommended this dish.\n          my husband ordered bone in ribeye steak, huge, cooked perfect but no taste or seasoning at all, it would need some sort of sauce to make it appetizing.  <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> is ok, just like any other <mark>Filet Mignon</mark>, nothing great about it.\n         luckily there's one dish that is worth mentioning, the <mark>Potato Gratin</mark> dauphineous, excellent, potato perfectly cooked, not much cream, hint of garlic and toasty top, excellent!\n        going back? no way, very expensive and i'm not happy.", 
            "overall, this is a good option for a high-end steakhouse.\n\ni order the <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> medallions and they were incredible. \n\nthe turn-off for me was the service.  super slow service and i felt that we were at times treated like second-class citizens.\n\noh well!", 
            "as i have been to the emeril delmonico restaurant in new orleans and enjoyed it immensely, i decided to have dinner at the delmonico steakhouse located in the venetian resort hotel & casino where i was attending the phantom of the opera later that evening (incredible show by the way!).  what you'll find is a variety of food selections with creole influences. \n\nfirst the menu prices are expensive ($$$$) but you are there for the intimate and fine dining experience and should be expecting to pay those prices.  what i didn't expect was to be dressed up and have an individual in shorts, sandals, and a baltimore colts jersey seated at an adjacent table to me.  kind of lowered my view of this establishment being world class if you know what i mean.\n\ni started with the <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> which was just superb but did lack the \"creole\" twist i was expecting (the bam factor).  only thing that was a little of an inconvenience was the lobster pieces were quite large and were hard to cut with my spoon.  the wife selected the <mark>Organic Baby Mixed Greens Salad</mark> creole spiced croutons, sherry vinaigrette, shaved manchego cheese roasted teardrop tomatoes and shaved red onion.  i had a taste and it was very good.  the different flavors were unique and distinctive.\n\nthe main course i selected a pinot noir wine that to go along with my ribeye steak and selected the <mark>Roasted Fingerling Potatoes</mark> and whole garlic with fresh herbs.  the wine was fantastic with a rich and bold body and floral aroma.  wasn't dry and complimented the ribeye steak very well.  the ribeye has emeril's classic touch written all over it with the blackened spice rub with a pat of herb butter on top.  the cut was 1-1/2 inches thick, lean, and very large portion.  the potato dish was okay, didn't impress me in any way.  the wife also had the pinot noir and selected the <mark>Filet Mignon</mark>.  the cut had to be nearly 2 inches thick, lean, and a normal portion size.  i recommend selecting your ribeye to be cooked medium rare (i do not recommend medium) and your <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> medium rare or at the most medium.  \n\nsorry to say we were extremely full when we finished and couldn't partake of dessert.  the meal described above with tip was roughly $210.", 
            "simply delicious!\n\ni went with a group from work while attending a meeting and everyone seemed impressed with the food. we started off with a few appetizers including the calamari which was a little on the salty side, roasted <mark>Butternut Squash Ravioli</mark> with duck and the crab cakes. \n\ni had the spinach and radicchio salad with apple rosemary vinaigrette and warm pistachio crusted goat cheesecake. yep, that's right, you heard me... a goat cheese cake. it was fantastic. \n\nfor my entr\\u00e9e i was worried because i had already filled up on the appetizers and my delicious salad but i managed to eat my <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> medallions with a bacon peppercorn sauce.  we split a few sides as a table including the broccoli, asparagus and some delicious corn dish. i have no idea who ordered it but for the love of all that is holy, you have to get this corn dish. it was phenomenal. the broccoli not so much... too al dente for me!\n\nfor dessert there were a few orders of the bread pudding and banana cream pie which no one seemed to complain about. the service was a little slow but maybe it was because the place was packed. there was way too much time in between courses. oh and it took at least 30 minutes to get drinks each round. maybe go early before the rush hits or just don't go with a party of 13 like we did.", 
            "service is to die for! ambiance not so much. floor molding and walls were dirty. its <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> is very basic and if you expect flavor its not for you. lastly, theyre white <mark>Truffle and Parmesan Potato Chips</mark> and bbq shrimp appetizers are worth the price tag. i probably wont go back.", 
            "emeril, i am dissapointed!\ni know you have many many restaurants to take care of, but it's your name that i trusted. i'd rather you not have 4 restaurants in vegas but 1 really great restaurant.\n\ni picked to go to delmonico for  my bday lunch since i had other plans for dinner, and the fact that i love a good steak.  we arrived around 11ish and the place was dead. the service was just not good, even on a quiet day like this?!\n\nwe got sitted. waiter wasn't rude but wasn't friendly and seemed like he doesn't want to be there. he came when we were ready to order, soups and entrees and a side, then he turned to leave, but i reminded him that we haven't ordered our drinks.   the drinks are usually the first thing servers asked!!\n\nwe were left alone in an empty quiet room. we got our bread from a different guy, who was a little friendlier.  but it drove me nuts because everytime he would put a roll on our plates, it was upside down.  the little round fluffy bread was facing downwards twice! i know it's not a big deal, but for the price of dining here, i expect a little more attention to details from the servers. and the butter was still frozen.\n\nmy <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> was pretty yummie. but my <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> was just average. i had to add more salt and pepper to it.  for half the price, i could get a better tasting <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> at home.\n\nmy bf on the other hand had the burger, it was gigantic and very tasty. i wished i had gotten the burger instead, and it was much cheaper too.\nit wasn't the size of the meal that i was looking for, but a tasty meal with the service in par with the price we pay.\n\nso in the end, my steak chowing experience at emeril's famous steakhouse was dissapointing and tasted average. if only the service were superb, it would have changed the whole experience of dining here, but unfortunately the service wasn't there either.\n\neven as we paid the check and was walking out, the lady at the front desk said thank you but was looking elsewhere, why bother?", 
            "really good steakhouse! we went there for our friend's birthday. the environment is nice but maybe a tiny bit noisier as i expected. my boyfriend and i ordered a <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> to share, which was good but not especially exciting. he ordered a <mark>Filet Mignon</mark>, i believe, and was fantastic! it literally melted in my mouth and we were able to cut it with a butter knife.. so tender! i ordered a season entree - grilled halibut on a bed of lumbcrab meat w/ some kind of aioli. it was alright... the crab was tasty but the fish was a bit dry... \n\nour friend ordered the tournedos au poivre and his girlfriend ordered the ribeye. the ribeye was huge for the price! we also ordered a couple of sides to share - new orleans <mark>Delmonico Creamed Spinach</mark>, sauteed <mark>Sauted Garlic Mushrooms</mark> <mark>Truffle and Parmesan Potato Chips</mark>. i have to say the mushrooms was really good! didn't really care for the <mark>Delmonico Creamed Spinach</mark> because it was too heavy for me. the chips was good, too, but i wanted to compare it to alexander's truffle oil fries... that's one of my future plans =p\n\noverall, i think the steaks are worth the price. other stuff are good but not extremely exciting.... i guess you should always go for the steaks at a steakhouse!", 
            "i gave myself a few days before i wrote this review, to see if all the money i dropped on this dinner would be worth it. i've never spent so much on a dinner before, and so even with the glowing yelp reviews, i went into this a little uneasy.\n\nmy boyfriend had paid for most of our vegas trip, so i wanted to treat him to something special. this most definitely was.\n\nwe made reservations that morning (thursday, so probably a slow night) for 7 pm. we arrived and were quickly seated. the decor was understated, with muted beige walls and plush brown leather chairs.\n\nthe service was impeccable. we had three waiters taking care of us! water glasses never got more than half empty, and they were always ready to please. i asked where the women's room was, and the waiter led me there instead of just giving me directions. i really appreciated that, since the bathrooms were hidden away.\n\nlovely bathrooms though, but i expected that. a nice touch for the ladies was a basket of feminine supplies provided in case of emergency,\n\nbut now, to the main attraction: the food. oh dear god, the food. we started with the <mark>Truffle and Parmesan Potato Chips</mark>. so simple, but sooooo good.\n\ni got a rare <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> and the boyfriend got the bone-in rib eye medium rare. we got just one side, the cheddar bacon grits. they were good, but could have used more bacon. then again, i think everything could use more bacon.\n\nthe meat was... quite literally the best i ever had. i love my steaks bloody, but my plate was clean until i cut into the steak. chalk that up to a good sear and the excellent crust from the rub they use. it was kinda cajun-y, but didn't overpower the glorious meat. it was allowed to prove itself as is and it was worth every penny.\n\nwe surprisingly still had room, so we went for dessert. i went for my old standby, the creme brulee. the boyfriend was intrigued by the root beer float with sarsaparilla sorbet. \n\ncan't screw up creme brulee, so no complaints. the sugar crust was thicker than expected, but the sweetness was offset by the chocolate shortbread cookies that came with it. chocolatey, but not sweet. i could snack on them all day.\n\nbut the root beer float was a work of art. came to the table in one of those tall sundae glasses, with the sarsaparilla sorbet on the bottom and vanilla ice cream on top. waiter poured the bottle of root beer and left the rest for him.\n\nmy boyfriend is a root beer connoisseur. he used to make his own, so he knows his root beer. and he is still going crazy over that float. i think that speaks for itself.\n\nso while at first i might have been apprehensive, i'm really glad we came here. it's out of our budget to do again anytime soon, but i definitely won't forget it.", 
            "\"wow!!!\" that's what she said... literally! lol, actually that's what we all said after we took our first bite into the appetizer (bbq shrimp). let me back track a little bit though. i made a reservation for four on open table... we were running a little late so i called and to let them know. they were very friendly and accommodating with our late arrival. as soon as we get there, they said \"you must be jason, party of 4 correct?\" very nice touch for a first impression. we were greeted by our main server, followed by the assistants. our server made good conversation and awesome recommendations. we never felt bugged, rushed, or belittled (since we all look pretty young). even with the huge wine list, we were scratching our heads and our server recommended a very good syrah that fitted within our budget.\n\nbetween the 4 of us, we ordered the bbq shrimp, <mark>Filet Mignon</mark>, <mark>Roasted Maine Lobster Tail</mark>, and i ordered the rib eye. seriously, every bite was wow! cooked to exactly the way you ask!!! you have to try it for yourself and you'll understand the wow factor this restaurant has!\n\nwhile making my reservations, i noted that it was a special dinner for me and my wife, along with my friend and his wife (our anniversaries of dating). lol...anyways, when we were about to ask for our check, the staff came out with two bowls of fresh strawberry sherbert/sorbet with a candle in it, followed by the words \"happy anniversary to you both and thank you for coming to delmonicos\"! i wanted to stand and applaud! hahahah our server then went on to take our digital camera's and take a couple pics of us.\n\nif you're looking for a restaurant with that wow factor (and you love meat), i highly recommend visiting delmonico's.", 
            "it's so sad that what made this place so memorable was that it was so mediocre... and that my travel buddy and i got into a heated discussion while trying to decide who's \"fault\" it was that we ended up there. we finally remembered how it happened - we were at the palazzo and she wanted steak. i wanted to stop at cut, but she wasn't a big fan of wolfgang puck. she likes mario batali, so we glanced over enoteca's menu, but of course - they didn't have steak. if we'd known of the existence of carnevino, we probably would've ended up there. i don't know if the steak would've been better..... but anyway, this is about delmonico. \n\nby the time we ended up in front of delmonico's steakhouse, we really were famished. it's emeril's steakhouse - couldn't possibly be awful.............\n\nwe ordered:\n* a bottle of red\n* jumbo lump crab cake\n         - [4/5 - good crab cakes - not the best, but definitely took first place over everything else we had.]\n* grilled <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> medallions\n         - [3/5 - it was alright. average in flavor, not tender.]\n* <mark>Filet Mignon</mark>\n         - [2/5 - she's a huge steak fan but first, they overcooked her steak - then sent her a second steak, which was still not much better and a little chewy.]", 
            "hey everyone - first yelp review. and what better way to kick it off than with the wonderful delmonico steakhouse in the venetian hotel and casino. this is my first emeril's experience and it was a good one. \n\ndisclaimer: a fraternity brother of mine is a manager here and insisted that my group try it! \n\ni was in town for a bachelor party and 8 of us dined here on a friday night. we had a reservation for 8:30 and were seated promptly. the appetizers included delicious (albeit greasy) chips sprinkled with parmesan cheese and the new orleans bbq shrimp with biscuit. the shrimp were easily the most tasty that i've ever had - my only complaint is that one order ($18 only included 3 shrimp). i wish i had 2 or even three. the biscuit was pointless for this entree (and barely noticeable), it actually went uneaten as our party was preoccupied with the wonderful hot butter rolls that they continued to bring around.\n\nfor my entree i had the <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> ($48) and it was absolutely fabulous. i order my steaks medium well to well, which could sometimes mean a loss of flavor if it's not done right. in this case, the steak was cooked perfectly and had a ton of flavor. this was easily the best steak i've ever had - and i'm a red meat fan. \n\nservice was excellent, atmosphere was a bit gloomy (although aren't good steak houses supposed to be?) and i was simply too full to try dessert. the rest of the party thoroughly enjoyed their meal. the highlight of the evening may have been seeing larry flynt seated just a few feet away from us, enjoying his steak and eggs. apparently he's a regular.\n\nif you're in vegas and looking for a sure-fire steakhouse, stop by emeril's delmonico. you won't be disappointed.", 
            "thinking of what to say, i find it's hard to stay on track and remember that i'm reviewing a meat 'n potatoes steakhouse that doesn't go out of it's way to be too fancy or adventurous, it just strives to make good food in a nice environment. \n\ni think a little is lost if you forget chef emeril's philosophy; watch him on tv, the guy just likes good food.  remember erik, you didn't eat at bouchon or french laundry... you didn't go on a magical food adventure.  you had a steak.  a damned good steak.\n\nthe ambiance is nice; dimly-lit, full-service, white-linen business casual kind of place.  the wife and i had good, attentive service, and our head waiter was a treat.  he was incredibly accommodating and helpful.  i had fun listening to him give the table next to us tips on eating in vegas, steering that couple away from tao (\"a nightclub that happens to serve food.\") and cut (\"way too salty and la pretentious for my taste.  maybe they've toned it down... the salt, anyway.\")\n\nwe started out with two appetizers, as we usually do, our favorite emeril's new orleans bbq shrimp with petite rosemary biscuit, and to get into the steakhouse mood, the wonderful <mark>Truffle and Parmesan Potato Chips</mark>.\n\nmy wife had the <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> medallions crusted in mushrooms with a pan sauce, don't remember of what, and i had the 9 oz. <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> with a small pad of maitre'd butter, cooked to a warm, pink, bloody center.\n\nboth were excellent.  for dessert, we capped our meal, and ourselves off with emeril's banana cream pie and the pecan pie.  i had a single jamaican blue mountain courtesy of cafes richard.  \n\nthe food was excellent, service was spot-on, and atmosphere was great, if a tad noisy.  unfortunately, the authentic kobe filet i had at fish house spoiled me on steaks forever, so as good as delmonico is, i can only muster 4 stars.", 
            "this probably tops my list of favorite restaurants.  i've been coming here since it first opened and it never disappoints.  the service here is impeccable, the steaks are amazingly delicious and the restaurant itself is very classy and decorated nicely.  i recommend the bone-in rib eye and <mark>Filet Mignon</mark>.", 
            "first, i want to say that it was totally cool to be able to make a reservation here via open table though yelp. it was easy and i didn't have to sign up for any additional stuff. big ups right there. i even received a confirmation email the night before (although i had already called to confirm the reservation).\n\nour server name? michael jackson. he didn't moonwalk for us but it was probably the best single display of customer service in a restaurant that i've ever had the pleasure of dining in. he was engaging, attentive, and even dropping \"kama'aina\" and a few other pidgin words upon realizing all of us were sitting there in our sig zane's (http://www.yelp.com/biz/sig-zane-designs-hilo).\n\nwe actually started with a small sampler platter that was given to us on the house because we were with our friends who lived there. i guess they like to encourage las vegas locals to come down more often. it was juicy because of the veggies on top, but the meat was a bit crisp and even more on the burnt side for me. after that we ordered the truffle oil <mark>Truffle and Parmesan Potato Chips</mark> and emeril's signature cajun <mark>Emeril's New Orleans Barbecue Shrimp</mark> appetizers. the <mark>Truffle and Parmesan Potato Chips</mark> were highly addictive and had a super rich flavor to them. add the parmesan and the saltiness was of great compliment. one of the many highlights to the evening was the shrimp appetizer. the large shrimp were wonderfully crafted with just the right amount of spices to encourage their fresh sweetness to linger.\n\ni ordered the special bone in rib eye steak. it was perfectly cooked to medium. the thing was pretty large and i finished off most of it, but coupled with everything else we ordered, it was a tall task. my good friend ordered the <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> medallions and they were spectacularly juicy and flavorful. i actually secretly wished i had ordered that instead.\n\nours sides consisted of <mark>Potato Gratin</mark>, caramelized seasonal onions, and <mark>Creamed Corn Gratine</mark>. they all were excellent in their own right. my friend described the <mark>Potato Gratin</mark> as the single best dish of <mark>Potato Gratin</mark> he has ever had. myself, i thought that the seasonal onions were spectacularly sweet. they blew my mind and i almost loaded up on those alone. the <mark>Creamed Corn Gratine</mark> was also sweet, but it wasn't as good as the other two. although, two spectacular sides out of three isn't too shabby.\n\noverall, it was a great spending time with good friends over an excellent meal in addition to the wonderful service. it was worth every expensive penny i could slam on the credit card. i would easily recommend to anyone the experience. reservations are highly recommended. one last note, we even got a hand-written thank you postcard less than a week later from michael. that was really nice.", 
            "i'm not a big emeril fan and i didn't like table 10 when i ate there. but, i was craving a good steak and crab cake so i crossed my fingers and made reservations for my birthday dinner. when we checked in with the hostess she wished me a happy birthday and, after waiting a few minutes in the lounge, seated us at a table tucked away in a corner of a room that was off of the main dining area. typically when my wife and i go out to eat we get stuck at the crappiest 2-top the restaurant has to offer. but this time around we were at a nice, big, four person table in a low-traffic area in the quietest part of the restaurant.\n\nnow, on to the food...\n//appetizers//\n* jumbo lump crab cake - a single crab cake with fennel, tomato and an herb salad on top. the crab cake was sitting on a slightly tangy, tartar-like herb emulsion. while it tasted delicious it just can't compare to real jumbo lump crab cakes from baltimore. the delmonico crab cake consisted of crab mixed with a binding element that tasted like a mayonaise based mix. personally, i prefer crab cakes with little else other than crab and some old bay. but, for a crab cake outside of maryland, this one was still very good.\n\n* roasted <mark>Butternut Squash Ravioli</mark> - the ravioli, sitting in a sage brown butter sauce, was excellent. the shredded duck on top of the ravioli was excellent. but, the pairing seemed slightly odd and unnecessary. sure, eating the two together was a sweet and savory delight that gave my taste buds a happy ending but i think the ravioli was good enough to stand on its own. the duck was a little overkill on a dish that was already fabulous.\n\n//amuse bouche//\n* shrimp dumpling - our apps were served so quickly that they came out before the amuse bouche, which the waitress brought out as we started digging in to the appetizers. this may not have been proper protocol, but we still appreciated the additional dish. the waitress called it a shrimp dumpling, but it was fried like a fried wanton. whatever you want to call it, it was served with a yuzu sauce and cucumber. it was a tasty bite -- a touch of acidity and tartness with some crunch -- but it felt out of place. i thought delmonico was a southern restaurant... what are they doing serving a heavily inspired asian dish?\n\n//entree//\n<mark>Filet Mignon</mark> with a side of sauteed garlic wild mushrooms - we weren't all that hungry so we split the entree. they didn't mind splitting the steak before it was served to us. when it came out each was on it's own plate with a small piece of butter resting on top (health food this is not). we ordered it medium rare, but it came out closer to rare. no problem, i don't mind a little blood. their steaks have a creole seasoning rub that makes for a strong peppery taste (they definitely kicked it up a notch). it's unique compared to the taste of other steaks around town and while it was a touch too salty, the filet was so tasty and tender that it didn't matter. the mushrooms were pure buttery, garlicky awesomeness. a great accompaniment to the filet.\n\n//dessert//\n* banana rum sorbet - with all the other stuff we ate we were feeling full so this light, complimentary dessert was perfect -- at least in theory. it's flavor was too subtle and bland, but still a decent way to cleanse the palate. it was free after all, so i shouldn't complain. the final thing served was a plate of mignardises -- while none were spectacular, they provided a deliciously sweet ending to a great meal.\n\ni only glanced at the wine list, as my wife and i only got a couple wines by the glass. but, in flipping through their extensive list i saw plenty of bottles priced well below $100. some as low as $40. so, it looked like they had something for everyone, no matter what your price range.\n\nthe service was top notch. we were waited on by two people who were very attentive, constantly checking if we liked everything, needed anything, and refilling drinks. it was odd how quick everything was served. our apps came out within 10 minutes of ordering (before the amuse) and our entree came out right after we finished our apps. everything seemed so fast-paced. on the way out the hostesses again wished me a happy birthday. this was some of the best service i've gotten at any restaurant in vegas.\n\nthe atmosphere felt like an upscale restaurant, of course, with it's wine room, stone wall (on one side), and vaulted ceilings. but, the white walls looked so bare. a touch of paint could do wonders. even adding more flair would make it more comforting and welcoming. my favorite thing about the decor was probably the chairs. they're large leather chairs that were so comfy. perfect seating for a steakhouse, in contrast to the office chair seating at cut.\n\ni wasn't expecting to be blown away by delmonico, but every aspect of my dining experience was as good as any other steakhouse i've been to in this city.\n\n4.5 stars", 
            "delicious.\n\ni took my boyfriend here as part of his vegas weekend treat (i secretly wanted to try it out too) and it did not disappoint. the service was amazing as you would expect for this type of restaurant. i made a note on our opentable reservation that it was for his birthday and every single person wished him a happy birthday, by name, as well as giving us lots of free goodies! \n\nwe pretty much ordered everything our hearts desired (which was a lot more than our stomachs could hold):\n\n<mark>Truffle and Parmesan Potato Chips</mark> - sounds simple enough, but i definitely recommend. nice, simple appetizer that happens to be divine.\n\nrun of the mill mixed greens and <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark>. the <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> is a must try! best i've had!\n\n<mark>Filet Mignon</mark> and <mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark> for our main course. very flavorful, cooked to perfection. the <mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark> is huge, so bring your appetite for this one.\n\nwe had chocolate sorbet on the house and ordered an additional slice of banana cream pie (we were curious why emeril's name was attached to it). that is the first time i've had banana cream pie and i feel like i could never eat it again unless it came from here. \n\nwonderful experience and will definitely have to make a trip back.", 
            "phenomenal!  came back here to celebrate a birthday and everything was what i expected and more.  my requests for a particular table were all handled without any problems.  \n\ni am usually a <mark>Bone-In New York Strip</mark> guy, but i was hungry so i opted for the bone in ribeye for the first time here.  birthday girl had the <mark>Filet Mignon</mark>. sides included <mark>Country Smashed Potatoes</mark> and broccoli. \n\nbone in ribeye: humongous! probably 20oz. +  beautifully crusted, with just the right amount of seasoning. steak as always, cooked perfectly medium rare, which made for an amazingly juicy and flavorful experience. \n\n<mark>Filet Mignon</mark>: now normally i am not a filet person, but i did try a piece or maybe two.  beautiful crust and to my surprise it also had excellent flavor.  tender as you would expect from a great cut of <mark>Filet Mignon</mark>.  however, still not as juicy as my steak was.\n\nservice as usual, impeccable.  insanely large wine list, with almost every wine imaginable.  complimentary amuse bouche and bread are also delicious.", 
            "so overall the food was amazing - we had shrimp and biscuit for appetizer with a delicious romaine salad, then <mark>Filet Mignon</mark>. the bread was to die for, the ambiance, and service were excellent...why not 5? \n\nmy steak was overcooked...i ordered medium, it was well...and this is a steak house. however, everything else was very well prepared and delicious. i will give them another try my next time in vegas!", 
            "i came here back in 2005 with my family and had a phenomenally memorable meal. six years later -- i came back this past weekend and it was stellar. extensive wine list, excellent service, ridiculously buttery brioche bread, great cocktails, and of course, the food!\n\nfor apps, my party had the <mark>Truffle and Parmesan Potato Chips</mark> (so rich but delish!), <mark>Butternut Squash Ravioli</mark> with duck confit (superb), <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> (mmm with large lobster chunks), and the wedge salad (as perfect as a classic wedge gets). \n\nfor entrees, i had the <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> that was perfectly cooked to a true medium-rare. i often find that, when i order med-rare, more often than not, highly rated restaurants overcook my meat to more of a med to med-well, which is can be disappointing. well, here at delmonico, it was perfect! friends got the <mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark> and the huge $85 fred flinstone steak (i forget the official name), all cooked to perfection. the 2007 joseph phelps cab paired divinely with the steaks. \n\nsides:  creamed corn was mind-blowing; <mark>Delmonico Creamed Spinach</mark> was good but didn't knock my socks off (compared to everything else which did). \n\nwe were too stuffed to order a dessert, but we received a complimentary birthday gelato. nice gesture, but it was not so great -- i think it was a non-conventional flavor, like fennel or something?\n\noverall, i would definitely return the next time i'm in the mood for a (pricey) steak dinner in vegas!!! emeril is a genius!", 
            "favorite steakhouse in las vegas. conveniently located in the venetian and servers are very attentive. classy, noise level wasn't too high, they even help the ladies with their chair when they sit. big list of wine choices and they have huge cuts of rib-eye. full bar you can order drinks from when you first enter the restaurant.\n\nmy first time i came with 2 other friends, i believe i ordered the <mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark>, which is unbelievably huge. it was literally bigger than my face. i got my ribeye in medium rare, and came out to be just right. lots of butter, and we also ordered a couple sides. picked out a bottle of wine which was the perfect topping to our fatty peices of steak.\n\nthey also serve dinner rolls! warm and soft, and lots of butter =]\n\ni came back in recent march and ordered a smaller cut, also in medium rare but it wasn't as good as my first time here. ate here with one other person, he ordered <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> which was very tender. we each ordered a glass of wine, although i'd rather choose a bottle instead next time as there are more choices of wine. also had the <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark>, which i absolutely love, so creamy but it was a little thin. not too many pieces of lobster meat either. ordered one side, a <mark>Baked Idaho Potato</mark> which was a little on the dry side.\n\nthere was a small fly that kept flying around us during dinner... it ended up in my water...\n\nhad creme brulee for dessert, they also serve homemade madeleine cookies with the creme brulee, both were very good.", 
            "i came here for my bros bachelor party and we had a party of 5. i made a reservation on opentable.com while i was at work and it was very convenient! we walked over here on saturday night around 6 to start the night off right with a good steak dinner. this place came highly recommended from a friend. \n\nthe restaurant was overly amazing. it was clean and dimly light like most steak places. the waiters were knowledgeable and prompt with their service. i got kind of a pretentious vibe from our waiter which was a little off putting. but it didnt bother me too much.\n\ni ordered the <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> medium rare and it was cooked to perfection. i was very impressed. the steak was soft and flavorful and melted in my mouth. the side dishes were just ok. we ordered broccoli, <mark>Delmonico Creamed Spinach</mark>, and <mark>Roasted Fingerling Potatoes</mark>. i wasnt impressed by the sides all that much. not extremely flavorful but still decent.\n\nwe also ordered a $200 bottle of wine which was the most expensive wine i have drank before. i didnt know much about it, the winery was called mastery and it was a red wine. my bro ordered it not me and it was really good! it was listed on the last page of the wine menu and was $40 a glass, but we ordered a bottle for the table. i wish i figured out what wine it was but it was really really good.\n\nthis is a good spot for a vegas dinner and a great way to start the night! i would definitely check out some other places before i come back here but i recommend it!", 
            "i've been to delmonico's twice. both times have been awesome. the wait staff is always very attentive and genuinely nice. they are also very knowledgeable about the menu and are happy to answer any questions one may have.\n\nthe <mark>Truffle and Parmesan Potato Chips</mark> are downright addictive and the steaks(i've only had the <mark>Filet Mignon</mark>) are delicious and well-cooked. the sides are delicious. what else can i say - delmonico's is the best!", 
            "amazing steak, as well as some of the best service i've ever had at a restaurant.\n\nmy friends and i came here for dinner on a sunday (with a reservation, just in case), and we decided to split two steaks between 3 girls. we ehard that the portions are very generous, and we also wanted to try out the sides as well.\n\nwe ordered the bone in ribeye, along with the bone in <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> with a mushroom sauce (one of the specials of the day).  we also ordered the <mark>Truffle and Parmesan Potato Chips</mark>, as well as the <mark>Creamed Corn Gratine</mark> and the <mark>Country Smashed Potatoes</mark>.\n\nthe first thing to come out were the <mark>Truffle and Parmesan Potato Chips</mark>. sadly, for a girl who eats <mark>Truffle and Parmesan Potato Chips</mark> as her main meal frequently, i couldn't partake of them because of the parmesan (i cannot stand stinky cheese).  however, i did at least try one, and the texture of the chip (similar to a kettle chip almost), and the slight hint of truffle was amazing. however, the parmesan was still prominent, so i watched sadly while my gfs devoured the chips. i felt as if i was being punished, for some reason.\n\nluckily our steaks arrived at that point, and they were huge. it was definitely a good idea that we had decided to split two instead of each of us ordering our own.  our server (who's name i forgot), was incredibly helpful and nice. he brought over a carving table and after presenting the steaks to us, took them aside and carved them all for us.  we got our sides at that point too, and we just dug in.\n\nthe rib eye was incredibly flavorful. i tend to not normally order it because not all places will grill the ribeye properly and i end up with a slightly tough steak (even if ordered at medium). this one had just the right amount or pink, and the seasoning was mild enough so that the flavor of the meat shone through.  \n\nthe filet was also very tender.  while we were eating the filet without the mushroom demiglace, i decided to test it out.  the sauce is based on a reduction of veal stock, and it complimented the steak wonderfully. it didn't mask the taste of the meat at all but just added another dimension to it.  after urging my friends to try the sauce, we quickly started pouring spoonfuls of it over the rest of the steak on our plates.\n\nthe sides were very good as well. the creamed corn had a hint of spice due to some mined jalapenos that were in it. definitely a trick i am looking forward to trying at home.\n\nas great as the food was, i was also very impressed with the level of service. you would think that a fancy steak restaurant would be annoyed at the sharing of steaks, but they never batted an eye to our request (apparently a lot of people do this).  in addition, we never felt as if we were waiting to flag down a server whenever we needed assistance.\n\nfor everything we got, the meal itself also came out to be a lot less than i expected (although i'm sure it has to do with the sharing as well). however, we were so full and satisfied from our meal that we promptly fell asleep back in our room and decided against going out that night. that is definitely a sign of a great meal.", 
            "hands down, the best meal i've ever had.\n\nmy boyfriend and i were 20minutes late to our reservation, but they stil accommodated us within 2minutes after getting there. we had three servers: one for wine, one for food, and one for.. i don't even know, just to make us feel like royalty!\n\nwe ordered the bone-in rib-eye and the <mark>Filet Mignon</mark>. although the bone-in rib-eye is the most popular steak at the restaurant, my personal favorite is the <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> just for its amazing tenderness. i'm really bad at describing taste with words, so all i will say is this: perfection. and you have to pair the steaks with the house red wine. it transformed our meal even more.\n\nand for dessert, we got the banana cream pie.. and i wanted to cry. that honestly the best way for me to describe my experience. i took one bite, and wanted to cry. \"it was the best tasting dessert i had ever had in my life\" is an understatement.\n\nfinally, i loved the look of the restaurant. it wasn't as dimly lit was i thought it would be, which i actually was pleasantly surprised about because i'm tired of not being able to see my food. the design is very minimalist but still very sophisticated.. but not too sophisticated that regular folks like my boyfriend and i didn't feel out of place.\n\nalthough it was incredibly expensive, the food and the overall experience was so incredible that even my boyfriend, who can be pretty frugal sometimes, said that delmonico's has to be a place we go back to every year. i can't wait for the next time. :)", 
            "probably the best steak ive had in my life yet.\n\nfirst and foremost it is a steakhouse.  so you can go ahead and eat whatever else is on the menu, but if you come to this spot without ever trying their steak youre a foolio.\nive been here several times now and each time my experience is stellar on the social and epicurious level.  good service, fantastic food, youre in vegas, what else do you want? (i guess winning jackpot at the casino would round it off nicely, but thats a whole 'nother story :)\n\nanyway, so in my opinion, dont even bother with the <mark>Filet Mignon</mark>, that cut is way over rated, which fancy pants rich people have turned into this \"exclusive\" non weight bearing tender cut of bovine that the social elite should be eating.  while, all of the tenderness story is true, the flavor is all in the bone in ribeye.  this place uses usda prime aged cut, which is the best you can get.  and get it bone in, the bones give off more flavor in the cooking process.  another sign of a good steak house is if its served with butter, which not every place does, but i personally think makes the meat taste 10x better.\n\none other thing i did like about this place is their dinner rolls served to everyone at the beginning of your dinner.  ya ya, dinner rolls, so what.  well, it was actually fresh here.  freshly made, warm, with a little bit of salt on it.  its like being at an awesome steakhouse that has a pan del sal bakery in it!  all in all, it's great food, great service, good location, being in between the palazzo and venetian, thats all you need.  just make sure you bring money, cause this place is on the pricey side, but have no fear, you will get your money's worth!", 
            "i decided to take my wife to las vegas for our first anniversary.  she'd never been to las vegas, but had always wanted to go.  she asked me if we could get dressed up and go somewhere nice one of the nights we were there.  so after doing a little bit of research i stumbled upon delmonico.  with a name like emeril lagasse associated with the place it had to be good right? i went to the website and looked over their menu.  the prices can be very intimidating to someone not used to a fine dining experience.  i really appreciated that the prices were on the menu on the website, because i would not have planned ahead otherwise, and might have choked when i saw them.  however, we only have one first anniversary so i decided we should go for it.  \n\ni called and made a reservation about 5 days in advance, the person on the phone was extremely courteous and helpful.  she asked me if we were celebrating a special occasion.  after i explained it was our first anniversary, she said that she would note it on the reservation.  \n\nwe arrived at delmonico at about 7:55pm, we had reservations for 8pm.  we were greeted at the front desk by a young woman.  she immediately said \"happy anniversary\" and asked us to have a seat in the lounge.  at about 8:05pm our name was called and we were led back to our table.  a table for four quickly became a table for two.  all the extra silverware, plates, and glasses were whisked away.  the serving staff was beyond courteous, even offering us black napkins due to our clothes being black.  \n\ndrink orders were taken and suddenly a plate was placed in front of us. \"courtesy of the chef, for your anniversary.\" said the server.  it was a crostini, with slightly cooked piece of beef, some blue cheese dressing, and chives topped with olive oil.  i hate blue cheese but i ate it anyway, and it was quite good.  \n\nthe server asked my wife about wine, and my wife said she liked it but was not very familiar with the types of wine.  the server asked my wife a few questions and came back with a glass of wine my wife loved, and a sample of another kind of wine she might like to have in the future, my wife loved the sample as well.  \n\nwhen it came time to order, my wife order the heirloom tomato appetizer that they have.  it basically sliced heirloom tomatoes with cheese and red onions, drizzled with oil and balsamic.  she loved it.  she also got the <mark>Filet Mignon</mark>, and <mark>Buttered Fresh Asparagus</mark>.  her steak was amazing, i tried a bite of it.  it was cooked perfectly.  it had a little spice to it from the seasoning, all around it was the best <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> i've ever experienced.  the asparagus was cooked perfectly.  \n\ni ordered the delmonico signature cut, a bone in ribeye.  ribeye is my favorite cut of steak by far.  i've been eating primarily ribeye for so long it's hard to believe that i was ever happy with other cuts.  i also ordered their take on creamed corn.  the ribeye was worth the whole trip, it was the by far the best ribeye i have ever encountered and probably ever will.  it was cooked perfectly.  it had the proper amount of fat that should be expected with a ribeye.  it was amazing.  the corn was really good also.\n\nour server then brought us another complimentary dish from the kitchen, cherry sorbet.  written in chocolate around the outside of the bowl was \"happy anniversary\".  it was pretty good, i'm not a big sorbet person, however please remember, it was free.  \n\neven with the complimentary dessert my wife and i couldn't pass up a chance to try one of the menu dessert items.  we chose butterscotch creme brulee.  it came with 3 butterscotch/chocolate chip cookies on the side.  it was amazing, and probably our new standard for creme brulee.\n\nall in all our experience was awesome.  the food was outstanding and the service was great.  my glass never got empty.  every time i finished a dinner roll another roll was promptly placed on the plate in it's place.  after the 2nd or 3rd roll, i looked over towards my wife, grinning.  the server saw this and quietly said with a smile on her face, \"you know that is going to keep happening.\" i told my wife that when i was over the rolls, i probably needed to leave a bite on the plate to avoid a new roll. it was funny.  \n\ni would recommend delmonico to anyone who is in vegas and looking for a great place to go.  i would encourage anyone who does go to go with the expectation or a fantastic meal.  i think if you go in with the idea of being critical, you will probably find something to complain about, as the couple at the next table did.  they had multiple issues, and sent a few things back to the kitchen.  remember that food preparation is an art not a science, and enjoy.", 
            "** 100th review ** \n\ni had been anticipating this lunch for a few days. delmonico has been a favorite of mine but i hadn't dined there for a year. and, i was meeting esteemed london yelper yee gan o., who was on one of his dining and roller coaster trips across america. talking with yee gan was great. in fact, our conversation was so animated that our server asked if we wanted him to remain away, because we were discussing business. i told him that it wasn't business we were discussing, and he was thus welcome to hover over us. but, besides the consistency of the bearnaise sauce, the one complaint i have is that on this outing the waitstaff did not come close to hovering. i had to ask for a second roll, iced tea refills occurred but not too frequently, and an empty butter dish remained empty. this was in sharp contrast to my earlier visits to delmonico where i could barely get a glass down to half full before it was refilled, and when a new roll appeared as soon as an old one disappeared. the restaurant was not very crowded at all, so being too busy could not legitimately account for the laggard service. it wasn't so much our server but our assistant server who fell down on the job. he was responsible for refilling glasses, resupplying rolls, and making sure sufficient butter was available on the table. \n\nnow on to the meal itself! my <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> was very smooth, creamy, and flavorful, with a few morsels of sweet lobster to nibble on as garnish. it was all i hoped for! the <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> that followed was better than i expected. it was very tasty, with very fresh romaine lettuce leaves and long croutons that when broken spread cheesy garlic flavor all over the lettuce, to join with the parmesan splinters that were liberally spread over all. it was an excellent dish! \n\nmy <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> looked forlorn on the plate. only a large pat of maitre d' butter appeared beside it. a little pink blood was also pooled on the plate beneath the meat, which to me was a good sign. the prime grade filet was cooked almost all medium rare to order, but a few spots were closer to medium, and the steak was more peppery than i prefer. otherwise it tasted very good. it could have tasted even better had i not forgotten to order bearnaise sauce until the steak arrived at our table. that was my fault, and it probably contributed to the drama that followed. but the filet on my plate was not a $50 steak, which is what i paid for it. for that price--especially at lunch--i expect the filet to be great. this one was very good but not great. its size was not listed, but it was no more than 8 oz. \n\nour server immediately put in the order for bearnaise sauce, but it did not arrive for several minutes. he then made a point of telling me that the chef makes bearnaise sauce to order, and was preparing a new batch for me. a few minutes later, as i chipped away at more steak without any sauce, still no sauce had appeared. so i ate more of my steak, which was at least still tasty standing on its own. then the bearnaise sauce at last arrived, but it was runny and not very flavorful. it looked like it needed to set longer, so i left it alone for about two minutes, but the consistency remained thin after then. again, my tardiness in ordering the sauce probably caused the chef to rush its preparation, so i take partial responsibility for an imperfect bearnaise on this occasion. let this be a lesson to all diners: order bearnaise sauce when you order your steak--not when it arrives! \n\nas i ate my steak, i looked longingly at yee gan's lobster sliders, which looked delectable. but i'll let him report on that as well as the <mark>Traditional New Orleans Gumbo</mark> that he also ordered, which looked delicious as well, and that i have enjoyed before. but delmonico is first and foremost a steakhouse, and i wanted to review one of its steaks. (however, i may slip in again soon and order lobster sliders on my next lunch outing there.) \n\nmy side of <mark>Country Smashed Potatoes</mark> was a smash hit, with creamy red-skinned potatoes with a little of the skin showing, a few circles of green onion sprinkled on top, and including some very tasty lumps of potato that quickly dissolved in the mouth. i was going to take the remaining uneaten half of this quite large side dish home, it tasted so good--but forgot to do so, for which i am still kicking myself. for dessert, yee gan and i split a generous slice of emeril's renowned banana cream pie, which was top-heavy with whipped cream, filled with luscious pieces of banana, and also bedecked with chocolate shavings and caramel sauce. as i savored each bite, i tried to conjure up how to best describe the taste of this concoction, and one word stood out: \"heavenly.\" the only comparable banana cream pie i have eaten is the last one i had at delmonico. and, this one was better by a shaving. \n\noverall, a very good lunch with great company!", 
            "ate at kitchen table for 40th birthday. great experience. the sous chef was a little nervous but the sommelier was great. definitely get the wine pairing. <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> with mushrooms and <mark>Pan Seared <mark>Foie Gras</mark></mark> was a great combination of flavors. desserts are amazing. thanks delmonico!", 
            "food was amazing. best <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> i ever had, perfectly cooked lobster. my husband had the ribeye, he's a true meat eater and is still raving about it. i had the <mark>Filet Mignon</mark>, incredible seasoning and cooked to perfection. ordered the creamed corn, delicious. \ndidn't give 5 stars....ambiance not in line with the high-priced menu. i've heard of minimalism, but it's bizarre to see art niches with nothing in them. noise level moderate. dress code needs to be enforced. arrived for a birthday dinner dressed to the 9's, watched a guy get seated @ a table near-by wearing camoflauge shorts and a polo shirt.\nfree sorbet for the b-day girl (seemed cheap)", 
            "five stars you ask? yes i answer and don't ever doubt me again. \n\nfirst let me mention they have one of the best wine lists in vegas due to the delmonico in miami closing down and sending 500+ wines to this one in vegas. sorry that your other restaurant closed, emeril, but thanks for the amazing wine.\n\nfor appetizers we had a sampler plate that consisted of bbq shrimp, cold <mark>Alaskan Red King Crab Legs</mark>, and truffle oil <mark>Truffle and Parmesan Potato Chips</mark>. all three were great but the truffle oil <mark>Truffle and Parmesan Potato Chips</mark> were freaking amazing! these were the first chips i have had in years and i am so glad i chose these to break my no chip policy. \n\nfor main i went with the <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> very rare and it was delicious with the perfect amount of dry rub and no sauce, just the way i like it. their sides are served family style and i love that. we had the wild mushrooms, creamed corn, asparagus, and garlic mashed potatoes. \n\nour dinner lasted three hours thanks to the amazing wine and they never once rushed us to leave. in fact, every time i came back to the table from the restroom (remember lots of wine) they had refolded my dinner napkin. now that's some damn good service right there! \n\nthe ambiance is classy with all white walls, rounded ceilings and an open layout. cheers", 
            "i had the privilege of coming here in honor of two fo my friends' birthdays last month. being the type of guy who rarely eats at anywhere higher than a two $ sign establishment, i'd have to say this is by far the best dining experience i've ever had in my life, so far.\n\nour night started off with a very informative waiter showing us the ropes. it makes sense why these servers make the money they make, they are extremely good at their job and know the menu and wine pairings like the back of their hand. ..at least the server we had was of this caliber.\n\nfor starters, we had the truffle parmesean <mark>Truffle and Parmesan Potato Chips</mark>. these things are incredible. it's one of those dishes where you just want to savor each bite one chip at a time. so good.\n\nwe also tried the <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark>. best <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> i've ever had. very smooth, rich in lobster flavor, and not too overly salty. some fresh cracked pepper makes it just absolutely perfect.\n\nmy two friends went for the chateaubriand. an exquisite cut of tenderloin(same cut as <mark>Filet Mignon</mark>) so tender that it just nearly melts in your mouth.\n\ni had the bone in rib-eye. quite possibly the best steak i've ever had in my life. i ordered it medium rare. it was cooked perfectly, and once i had a taste, i just had to close my eyes and shut down all my other senses so that i can thorougly enjoy this. it was quite a big steak, but with the price i paid and the epic state of mind i was in, i finished it knowing that i couldn't leave all that buttery meaty goodness behind unfinished.\n\nthat on top of a bottle of wine and a few sides, our meal came out to be.. well.. expensive. but so worth it.", 
            "i been to sw steakhouse, cut and craftsteak in vegas. delmonicos ranks right up there with those 3 steakhouses.\nattire here is business casual.\nservice is spectacular. water and soda glasses were always filled and hot warm bread every 5-10 minutes brought out to us. \nif you go, you must get the <mark>Truffle and Parmesan Potato Chips</mark> for an appetizer. amazing mouthwatering omg... $10 for a big batch of chips.\nmy bone in ribeye was awesome. my friend's <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> was superb and his gf's salmon was good.\n\nthat being said, i only give this place 4 stars because my <mark>Baked Idaho Potato</mark> and friends doubled stuffed potatoe were a bit dry. maybe i will try the polenta next time?", 
            "food was great.  i had the aged rib eye, and my wife had the <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> medallions.  the service was top notch.  attention to detail.  i will be back!", 
            "holy hell. this place was yummy\n\nawesome thing, no split plate charges. my gfs and i were not yearning to eat a 22 oz steak, so it was nice to be able to split the entrees. we ordered the bone-in rib eye. you must order that, especially if you're a steak eater. medium rare, and that's how steak should always be. we also tried the grilled <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> medallions, which we overdone, medium rare my a$$, it was more like medium well-well done. but it did have a good taste. i don't believe in returning food.\n\nthe creamed corn was the shiznit. it was soooooo good. and the asparagus was good too, tender and perfectly buttered. \n\nof course i can't skip dessert, had the creme brulee, which as ok. a bit too much sugar on top, but overall not bad. we had a bday and was given banana sorbet - gross. :p but the brioche bread pudding w/ bourbon and ice cream. was to die for. sooooo delish. :d\n\ni will return for the <mark>Truffle and Parmesan Potato Chips</mark>. :d and rib eye!", 
            "i don't think i could have found a more perfect place to celebrate my birthday! \n\nafter an amazing experience in december, i was so pleased to hear we would be going back for my birthday! i decided that this time around i would try out something besides steak. i knew they had steak down pat, but if this were truly an emeril place, i knew i had to check out the other menu selections. so this time around we enjoyed the <mark>Selected Artisanal Cheeses</mark> to start and i had the shrimp with fettuccini with olive oil. my husband enjoyed a trio of <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> medallions. the pasta was perfectly cooked, not overly dressed in sauce with the shrimp cooked to exactly the right temperature.  my husband's filets were also perfectly done and the sauces that adorned the medalions were amazing. truly amazing. we shared the potatoes au gratin and of course, these were just as heavenly as i remembered from our first visit. \n\nfor dessert, we shared the chocolate root beer float. the root beer was abita, made in louisiana. it was mild in flavor yet refreshingly delicious. i could swear that the chocolate ice cream was house made though i don't know that for a fact. it was sooooo refreshing and just the right way to top off our meal.\n\ni love delmonico. it is by far my favorite restaurant in vegas. i can't wait to go back. one day i hope to meet emeril and hug him for making such wonderful food.", 
            "service and food were worth the $200 bill for 2.  my husband and i chose the delmonico for our wedding night dinner last month.  we had a champagne toast, the chef sent out complimentary bisque as a wedding gift and sorbet after the meal. my husband ordered the <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> and i ordered the pecan encrusted <mark>Herb Marinated Chicken Breast</mark>.  we splurged (i rarely order dessert) and shared a piece of chocolate cake.  everyone was pleasant but with an air of regal you would expect in an upscale restaurant.\nthe only complaint was the table next to us having a serious religious conversation during what should have been a pleasureable friday evening.  we made the best of it though and had a few jokes to keep ourselves entertained...", 
            "first time here and i will be back!\n\ni made reservations a week before on their website and asked for a nice table.\n\nmy party of 4 arrived early, but no problem- they had our table ready for us!\n\nwe ordered a bottle of cabernet sauvignon ($65) and had the following:\n\ni ordered two appetizers for my entree:\n1. <mark>Vine-Ripened Heirloom Tomato Salad</mark> with burrata cheese, red onion, extra\nvirgin olive oil, balsamic vinegar and torn local basil.\n- i was a little sad that the burrata cheese was so small compared to the heirloom tomatoes, but it was delicious!\n\n2. <mark>Butternut Squash Ravioli</mark> with sage brown butter, toasted hazelnuts and parmesan\n- omg!  so good!  the squash was divine.  i would definitely order this again.\n\n3. grilled marinated organic <mark>Herb Marinated Chicken Breast</mark> - <mark>Roasted Fingerling Potatoes</mark>, whole\ngarlic, wild mushrooms and natural reduction\n- the person that ate this said that the chicken was cooked perfectly and had really good flavor.\n\n4. <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> w/ a twice <mark>Baked Idaho Potato</mark> (with bacon and vermont cheddar) and a <mark>Caesar Salad</mark>.\n- he said that the steak melted in his mouth!\n\n5. surf & turf- bone in ribeye and crab & <mark>Buttered Fresh Asparagus</mark>, i believe.

            "a bit torn about this place...\n\ni heard through the grape vine that delmonico steakhouse was the best steakhouse in las vegas. having heard that, i made reservations for delmonico 2 whopping months prior to my boyfriend's birthday.\n\nthe evening finally arrived when we were going to dine at this fabulous establishment. upon entering the host was a bit busy fiddling with something to greet me immediately. when he did, he told us to have a seat in the lounge and that our table would be ready shortly. after 2 minutes, our hostess showed us to our table and even laid the napkin in our laps. it didn't take long for us to order so i got the <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> and a side of potatoes gratin, while my boyfriend had the ribeye and the jumbo crab.\n\ninitially the <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> was quite delicious, very juicy and delicious. getting near the end of my filet, however, it started getting dry, and i tasted the herbs and spices grinding against my tongue. the potatoes gratin were good but a little dry, i would have liked it to be a little more moist. i tried a piece of my boyfriend's ribeye and it was nice and tender, and the jumbo crab did not disappoint.\n\nour server(s) were nice, however i felt a bit rushed during the meal. he did one hell of a job taking our pictures tho! overall, delmonico's would be a 3.5", 
            "we came here for our one year anniversary dinner.   i was a little intimidated to eat at a place like this in vegas but once we were seated everyone was super nice and didn't make us feel like we shouldn't be there.   \n\nthe menu has a bunch of different things on it but the star of the show (as told by my waitress) is the beef.   husband and i knew we were both going to order steak before we even looked at the menu.   \n\ni ordered the ribeye with <mark>Country Smashed Potatoes</mark> and husband got the <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> with creamed corn.   the side were served family style and were more than enough for two people.   the creamed corn was fantastic.  it had little bits of jalapeno in it for the extra bam!  \n\nwe both ordered the <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> to start.   bisque was very delicious especially the lumps of lobster meat.   did you know during the summer the bisque is dairy free?  \n\nthe steaks were just okay.  asked for mine medium but it came out well done so i didn't find it that good.  husband also asked for medium but basically got a rare steak.   \n\noverall though the atmosphere was definitely upscale yet comfortable.  i want to compliment our waitress ...she was very friendly and fun.   check was $164 dollars for two people.", 
            "been wanting to go here for a long time so when a media contact/vendor asked me to lunch here i didn't hesitate!  the ambiance was lovely, low light, tasteful decorations, great big leather chairs.  we had water, bbq shrimp, lobster sliders, steak medallions with side of garlic mashed, chocolate layer cake with coconut ice cream for dessert.  \n\nbbq shrimp was delicious!  had a homemade bbq sauce that was just tangy, sweet and rich enough.  large shrimp came with about five i think very yummy.  \n\nmy entree was the something something steak medallions - (sorry it's not on the lunch menu online and i can't remember exactly what it was called) it was extraordinary.  i think after looking through the photos they were the <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> medallions - i am a red meat junkie and before this carnevino was the best steak i ever had - this one ranks right up there.  perfectly medium rare, flavorful with delicious meaty mushrooms, and as tender as a steak could be.  just delicious.  be warned it doesn't come with anything - just the meat so be sure and order a side dish or two.  i ordered the garlic mashed potatoes which come in this cool metal pan/dish thing.  they are a very large portion so that was good.  the mashed potatoes were soooooooooooooo creamy.  very very good.  \n\nwe ordered the chocolate layer cake with coconut ice cream for dessert.  this is why i gave only four stars - the cake a'ight.  nothing special.  it was enormous though so you'll get the bang for your buck.  my sister is a pastry chef so i might be a little extra picky on my dessert but there you have it.  \n\nfor what we ordered plus my vendor ordered an additional 3-scoop bowl of coconut ice cream on the side it came to $91.  it's pricey - so be sure to eat the warm bread they give you at the beginning so you can be full, lol.  but the portion sizes were generous, the service was incredible and the food delish.",

(i cannot wait for another 30 minutes for a new one. doesn't a customer's time mean anything to you?) this is nice. but when the chef finished cooking my steak, how can he decide this is ok to serve? he must have cared so little about how his customer would think to decide to serve me this. let me tell you. it is no different than spitting in my face.\n\npaid 95 dollars for the bill. i am feeling like a complete loser right now. good thing is at least i came alone. if i have brought my gf, she would think i want a break up. and michael, next time this happens, just take 20 dollars off the bill. you guys can never be a top notch restaurant.",

            "i was treated to a lovely birthday dinner here and was pleasantly surprised.  the restaurant is a lot bigger than it actually looks.  walking past it in the venetian, you wouldn't believe it extends back to a full restaurant.\n\nthe ambiance is elegant, comfortable, but friendly.  the manager came out before our meal to greet us and wish me a happy birthday, which was rather special.  the wine list was over 100 pages long and took us quite some time to decide which bottle to get.\n\nwe had the truffle & <mark>Truffle and Parmesan Potato Chips</mark>, which were just okay, and a small charcuterie plate with homemade cheese chips.\nfor our main courses, i ordered the <mark>Filet Mignon</mark>.  my date ordered the bone in ribeye with <mark>Pan Seared <mark>Foie Gras</mark></mark>.  my steak was arguable the best steak i've ever had.  it was perfectly buttery, seared and charred on the outside but tender, moist, juicy, and pink on the inside.  i had a bite of the ribeye with <mark>Pan Seared <mark>Foie Gras</mark></mark>, which was just savory overload.\nfor dinner, we received a complimentary \"happy birthday\" sorbet with a candle in it.\n\ni had a great experience there and would go back again for the steak.  i only gave 4 stars and not 5 because the other menu items (starters and sides) were very forgettable.  the steak however, was unforgettable. \n\ndate night seal of approval!", 
            "best pecan pie ever!\n<mark>Creole Boiled Gulf Shrimp Cocktail</mark>, good but nothing special, i thought it would be more cajun. oysters fresh and the horseradish was so good! <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> very good. the steak was pretty good i had a <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> and my husband had the ribeye it was huge! everything was cooked well. i have had a better steak but it was good. the best thing was the dessert of pecan pie. i'm just going to go there for that!", 
            "i came here with some girlfriends during my bachelorette weekend in vegas. we had a reservation for 7 girls, and were very promptly sat at our reservation hour.\n\nthe service here is spectacular, and the food is equally enjoyable. my girls and i shared our entrees and side dishes, so that we could each have a taste of a little bit of everything.\n\nentrees:\n- <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> - 9 oz, and absolutely melt-in-your-mouth yummy. this cut was like butter.\n- <mark>Emeril's BBQ Salmon</mark> - also melted like butter with every bite. it was amazing how tender, yet well-cooked the fish was. the hash side dish that came with the meal was very complimentary!\n- grilled marinated organic <mark>Herb Marinated Chicken Breast</mark> - mostly juicy (a teeny bit dry), but great flavors. the <mark>Roasted Fingerling Potatoes</mark> were pretty standard, and the wild mushrooms weren't very tasty to me.\n- bone in ribeye - 20 oz, and great for sharing! our waiter even cut the steak for our girls so that each could have medium rare/well.\n- american red snapper - the sides didn't seem as appealing at first for my friend who had this dish, but she ended up enjoying them!\n\nsides:\n- creamed corn gratin\\u00c9e - delicious. a great combination of that sweet and salty flavor. texture was right on point!\n- <mark>Buttered Fresh Asparagus</mark> - fabulous crunch, and not so much flavor added to cover up the natural enjoyable flavor of the veggie\n\nall in all, a great experience. we weren't too full at the end of the meal, and didn't have to worry about wasting any food or taking back any leftovers.\n\nhighly recommended!", 
            "i am a sucker for celebrity chef restaurants. after a poor dining experience at gordon ramsey's pub & grill, i was a little skeptical to try another one. delmonico was wonderful and would blow the pants off anything with gordon ramsey's name attached.\n\nthe service here was impeccable. we had multiple servers and they all worked as a team. we never had to ask for anything because they were always on top of it.\n\nthe wine list was like a novel! \n\ni ordered the <mark>Vine-Ripened Heirloom Tomato Salad</mark> with burrata, which was very tasty. for my meal, i had the <mark>Filet Mignon</mark>, cooked perfectly medium rare. overcooked meat does not make me happy, so i was very pleased with how mine came out. i also ordered a <mark>Baked Idaho Potato</mark> with the works...this potato was huge. the waitress even offered to being me more toppings if i ran out.\n\nfor dessert, we tried the banana bread pudding which was delicious and very rich with a scoop of ice cream on top.\n\ni was extremely impressed with delmonico and would absolutely eat there again!",

            "i have eaten at this restaurant twice. the first meal was memorable and i never forgot it. as a result, i was so excited to go back last week. i had the <mark>Truffle and Parmesan Potato Chips</mark> for an appetizer which were good but they didn't fit in with that kind of restaurant. my friend had a shrimp appetizer that was the favorite of the waiter's but we both found it very strange. it was supposed to be something creole and the shrimp was covered with an unattractive brown sauce. odd.\n\nwe both had a <mark>Filet Mignon</mark>. i ordered mine medium rare. i couldn't finish the last 15% of it because it was rare. disgusting. it was fine but not worth $50. it came with a  sauce that made it delicious though. without the sauce it would have been a big disappointment.\n\nwe ordered a side of double <mark>Baked Idaho Potato</mark>. that was the best part of the meal.\n\nwe each ordered a dessert. i had the banana cream pie. it was gorgeous but it was all bananas (which i love) but with little cream. it was fine. my friend had the creme brulee and it was delicious.\n\nservice was very nice. overall at $312 i won't be going back simply because it isn't worth the money.", 
            "best <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> of my life...cooked to perfection with cajun spices. the wine list blew my socks off...and i am a viticulture/enology geek (in normal english...i am a wine snob). this, was in fact, the most impressive part of my meal here. i couldn't stop turning the pages of the wine list (evidently the largest wine list on the west coast). the sides are unbelievable and complementary to the steak. i highly recommend the carrot cake for dessert. emeril sure outdid himself here.",

(only odd thing...when the crumbs were cleaned off the table while i was between a course, they were not cleaned to a plate, but the empty chair).", 
            "i had the pleasure of dining at this restaurant while i was visiting vegas with my fiance. we were staying at the venetian and this location is conveniently located within the beautiful hotel so it was an easy choice for dinner. it is definitely nice not having to step outside of the ac when the average temperature outside is 115! \n\ni got the <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> to start and <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> for the main dish. some of the side items we got were spinach, asparagus, wild mushrooms, and <mark>Creamed Corn Gratine</mark>. the main dishes do not come with sides so they are extra but the portions are large enough to share. \n\ni asked for my <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> to be medium rare and it was done perfectly. the steak was so tender and delicious! it was definitely one of the best steaks i have had. the sides complimented the meat nicely and everything single one of them were delicious. i wish i could comment on their deserts but we were both so full by the end of the meal that we decided to skip desert. this restaurant is a must if you are in vegas!",

            "so this review is going to be two sided since we had mixed experiences. let me start out by saying this is my 3rd emeril's restaurant in vegas. the other two places fish house and table 10 are always on the half priced ticket booth so a discount is always possible but given this is a steakhouse in the venetian no discount. we came here on dec 30th before our marroon 5 concert. securing a reservation over the phone a few days ahead of time was easy. we had wine, appetizers,2 main entrees,2 side dishes and a dessert. \nthe service and customer service here is exceptional. \n\nwe tried the <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark>, pasta special appetizer, bbq shrimp, cajun ribeye, <mark>Filet Mignon</mark>, gratin potatoes, mushrooms and the choc cake. \nmost of the food was delicious but a few fell short like the ribeye and choc cake. the ribeye was overcooked, not that tender and lacking seasoning. the choc cake was dry and previously frozen. the special pasta appetizer was good but not excellent or anything i would mention ordering again. \nthe filet was delicious and the demi glaze sauce was the highlight. the bbq shimp were delicious along with the little biscuit that comes with it. the <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> was creamy and seasoned well. my server let me try a sample before deciding on a main appetizer. \n\nwhen asked about our dining experience- we were completely honest with the manager and our server. the main issue was how long we waited for our meal and the $55 ribeye didn't live up to his name. they also forgot to put in one of our appetizers. however, this place gets a four instead of a three because of the amazing customer service we received as a guest. they expedited our food and when we received the bill the ribeye, 2 appetizers, and the cake was taken off our entire bill which to me speaks volumes about how great their customer relations and service is. they have a name to live up to . we had a mixed dining experience but i would probably come back and give this place another chance due to the outstanding customer service. keep up the good work.", 
            "every single thing that we have tried here was above expectations. had the <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> and <mark>Colorado Rack of Lamb</mark> with <mark>Roasted Fingerling Potatoes</mark> and <mark>Sauted Garlic Mushrooms</mark>. the filet was oh so soft and the lamb was ever so juicy! will come back here for yet another dinner splurge.", 
            "this time, for dinner, emeril's employees took it up a notch, and diane and i enjoyed a five-star dining experience here.  we were initially served an amuse bouche of bruschetta, tomato, mozzarella, & balsamic followed by an ordered starter of <mark>Emeril's New Orleans Barbecue Shrimp</mark> that came with a light petite rosemary buttermilk biscuit and strong, heavy bbq sauce.\n\nwhile diane enjoyed a bowl of <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> with maine lobster garnish, i savored the vibrant contrasting flavors of <mark>Traditional New Orleans Gumbo</mark> with shrimp & andouille sausage.  then it was time for our mains.\n\nwhile diane worked on a petite filet without char, i applied myself to a 9-ounce lightly charred <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> cooked perfectly medium rare as ordered, with a large pat of maitre d' butter melting slowly over the top.  both steaks came with classic yorkshire pudding, which tasted best after being rubbed in meat juices that ran slightly on the plate.  the meat melted in the mouth, aided by dipping in either a quite tasty homemade worcestershire sauce or drinkable b\\u00e9arnaise sauce.  i also topped my towering rectangle of beef with a side of sauteed garlic wild mushrooms, which included multiple varieties.  we also shared a large side of very cheesy and crusty <mark>Potato Gratin</mark>.\n\nfor dessert, for us there was no choice.  it was foreordained.  no one makes banana cream pie better than emeril lagasse!  one slice of emeril's banana cream pie was easily enough for both me and my spouse to share.  together we delighted in this rich confection of ripe banana chunks set in layers like a brick wall with sweet cement, and adorned with chocolate shavings, whipped cream, and caramel sauce.  mellow decaffeinated arabica coffee served in a french press just further enhanced the end of this fine meal.  seating was very comfortable in a half-booth, and service was both professional and knowledgeable. \n\nwe will surely return for more of the same!",

            "we expected much better. the design of this restaurant is great, the service is great but the steaks are not great. they started us with a complimentary thin slice of cucumber topped with tiny lentils, a tasty tidbit. we then had the <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> which was very good with large chunks of lobster in it. my husband had the bone- in ny strip,medium rare, it was grizzly and very chewy, not worth a price tag of $50. i had the petite piedmontese <mark>Filet Mignon</mark>, 6oz., although extremely small for $50.00 it was very good. we were then given a small scoop of complimentary blood orange sorbet and finished the meal with the pecan pie, good but not memorable. with all the steakhouses in vegas we have no reason to return here.", 
            "my first review on yelp. only reason i'm doing this review is because of delmonico's steakhouse at the venetian. we were tired of the average buffets and fast food and we really wanted to have a fancy night. so we looked up on yelp for a nice fancy restaurant. we decided on delmonico's and called in to make reservations for two at 530. came 530, we were still at the pool, so we called in and pushed the reservation to 630. staff accommodated us, which was surprising. we came to restaurant at 630 and were seated immediately. the staff are on the dot with their reservations. right after we were seated, the waiter asked what we would like to drink. i ordered a usual neat johnny walker black label and followed it with a 7&7. i believe every man should learn to love whiskey. my lady ordered a water lol. we then looked at the menu. i read all the reviews on yelp and just jumped straight to the assortment of steaks they had available. my lady ordered a new york t bone steak and i had the <mark>Filet Mignon</mark>. we also ordered the <mark>Butternut Squash Ravioli</mark> for the appetizer and mashed potatoes to eat with the steaks. \n\nfirst came ravioli. it was 5 pieces of ravioli. my first thought was,\"damn i'm getting jipped out of 15 bucks\" but when i bit into the first piece of ravioli, i literally had an mouth orgasm... no homo. it was the best ravioli i ever had in my life. hands down. i wish i had a whole plate full of it. my lady was hella impressed as well. \n\nthen came out the steaks. i hade mine cooked medium rare and she had hers done medium. the first bite was the best. succulent, tender, easy to chew. best steak i ever had in my life.",

            "i'll start out by saying the service and environment were both great.  delmonico seems to draw a good balance between those hyper-formal restaurants where utensil etiquette matters and more casual fine dining restaurants. \n\ni tried the <mark>Pan Seared <mark>Foie Gras</mark></mark> and octopus appetizers.  the octopus was delicious and had a decent amount of meat.  the <mark>Pan Seared <mark>Foie Gras</mark></mark> was rich.  i followed these with the gumbo which had a mild spiciness that anyone should be able to enjoy.\n\nthe disappointment occurred during the main course.  three of the people in our party ordered the <mark>Filet Mignon</mark>.  two of us were immediately dissatisfied with the plate.  i had ordered medium-rare and my dissatisfied friend had ordered theirs rare. my filet was noticeably dry and neither were especially tender. i suspect mine may have been overcooked because the third filet was also a medium-rare and the butter on top of their steak was still present, whereas mine had altogether melted by the time the plate reached our table.    additionally, whatever seasoning was used for my filet was not spread evenly.  there was only one bite where the seasoning became obvious and it overwhelmed the flavor of the meat.\n\nfor a steak that costs over $50 at an establishment that is a steakhouse, i hold it to certain standards, like being appreciated by a majority of the people at my party who ordered it. i can understand one person not enjoying their steak at a table because they have specific preferences, but for two people at the same table to be dissatisfied makes me believe the quality of the cooking is unreliable.  i have definitely cooked better steaks than the ones i tried  during this meal, and unfortunately this is the first steakhouse i have been to where that has been the case.", 
            "i rarely write reviews, even though i rely on yelp very heavily for my restaurant selections! it's usually just because nothing overwhelmed me, or i was too lazy to do so - i'm trying to be better about that! my husband and i went to las vegas last week for our first year anniversary to get a way for a few days. we always try and scout out new restaurants. this was definitely our favorite meal - hands down! the entire experience was great -- they brought out a small treat for us to start, then we both had amazing bourbon cocktails, and then dove into the delicious food. i got the <mark>Filet Mignon</mark>, but prepared piedmontese style which is just seasoning, olive oil, roasted garlic, and rosemary - it was cooked perfectly (medium) and super tender and had great flavoring. it didn't need any sauce! my husband got the <mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark> which they are known for i believe - i had a few bites and it was fantastic. the au gratin potatoes were also good and not overly heavy like some can be. our wine was great as well, stag's leap. the best part of the experience though was our waiter rene. he was so attentive, fun to talk to, and just wanted us to enjoy ourselves. he really made this experience special. i also have some dietary restrictions and i've never seen a restaurant be so attentive to them. it really put me at ease. next time you're in vegas, go here. we'll be returning for new year's this year and have already recommended it to some friends going out later this month!"

            "by far the best steak i have ever had. we had dinner here to celebrate a friend's birthday. they met a few requirement we needed, a late reservation and corkage. most places in vegas don't do corkage and he was super attached to the wine that he brought. \n    the service was incredible. they were so attentive and well versed when it came to the menu. out of the 6 people we had with us 5 were or are in the food industry. the man was an executive chef and the rest are fine dinning servers. our servers kept them very happy. \n   the man and i shared the cesar salad for two prepared table side. i had the fillet <mark>Oscar Style</mark>. it was honestly the best steak i had ever had. they were very generous with the crab and asparagus. the rest of our party dinned on rib eye, <mark>Double Cut Kurobuta Pork Chop</mark> and the day's specials. it was all amazing. we finished off the meal with a banana creme pie. i don't really like banana cream. this was outstanding. real sliced bananas with fresh creme, my god! \n   when the bill came were pleasantly surprised at how reasonable it was. a little over $500 for 6 people and 3 bottles of wine.  \ni can't wait to go back!", 
            "las vegas...i have so many unforgettable memories...\n\ni first came to this sin city on a cold winter night with my college roommates.  the youngest of us had just turned 21 and we needed to prove we were adults.  back then, new york new york was the hottest hotel on the strip and we went crazy, imitating diana ross and the supremes (i would say we were the original \"dreamgirls\" and i have pictures to prove it).  we couldn't afford a lobster for each person, so we shared 1 among 4 of us. we were young, naive, dirt poor and shameless.  \n\nsummer in vegas is a miserable time, and my sisters and i braved that heat by looking at the bellagio water fountain in awe.  that water show is still the favorite part of my trip every time i go to vegas.  of course, this all happened before \"ocean's eleven\" featured that famous last scene.  i don't think we looked as cool as brad and george though...\n\ni swore to myself that i'd never be back to this city after our incident at a club.  we got kicked out for having too much fun!!!  it was for a bachelorette party, and i think paris hilton was slightly jealous because we drew more crowd than her performance on that night.  we continued to party on in our suite and i discovered that night that jacuzzi could make even the most prude girl hot and steamy!!!\n\ni am no longer young nor have enough energy to party all night, but vegas proved to be a great place to have some of the finest dining experiences one can enjoy.  this time, our sole purpose of the trip was to eat at delmonico steakhouse, and what a fantastic night we had!!!\n\nsome of us had been here before, so the night started with the chef's complimentary appetizer which was a capane of smoke salmon on puff pastry.  a bottle of red wine was chosen from their extensive wine list along with fried calamari and <mark>Emeril's New Orleans Barbecue Shrimp</mark> as appetizers.  i can't make a comment on the wine, but the calamari had overwhelming amount of olives for my taste.  i did love the shrimp as they were cooked perfectly in that tangy sweet bbq sauce.\n\nsome of us were disappointed that the restaurant no longer offered <mark>Double Cut Kurobuta Pork Chop</mark>, but the special of the night was pork tenderloin with braised bacon, and they happily opted for it.  a couple of us ordered a bone in filet, the bf ordered a bone in ribeye and i got a <mark>Filet Mignon</mark>.  my butterflied medium steak was perfectly charred outside with some pink inside and it was very tender and juicy.  i tasted the pork dish and i loved every part of it.  i never knew that a chunk of bacon could be so buttery and sweet, and the cane syrup they used to braise was just perfect for that white fatty meat.  the highlight of the night was the bone in ribeye.  that thing was huge with so much flavor!!!  i rarely eat any pink meat, but the bf's medium rare steak was so delicious i didn't care for the color of it.  seriously, if you ever get a chance to go to delmonico, get their bone in ribeye.  you'll thank me forever for the best steak ever!!!\n\nwe also ordered sauteed garlic mushroom and <mark>Roasted Fingerling Potatoes</mark>.  it was a mushroom heaven with all different kinds of them (shiitake, button, oyster, portebello, etc) cooked in chopped garlic and the aroma itself could make someone's mouth watery.  those purple, yellow and red potatoes side dish was recommended by our maitre d' and it didn't disappoint us.  maybe it could be too heavy for a light eater with all that meat, but for a person like me (a meat & potato girl), i couldn't ask for a better meal.\n\ni must say this steakhouse is a place to impress someone.  it's a huge restaurant, but since it was sectioned into 3 different rooms, it rather felt intimate and quaint.  small tables were cornered so you could be private and although the restaurant was busy, i never felt rushed.  the waiters were not those friendly joker types, but the service we received was more than adequate and appropriate.  \n\ndelmonico renewed my faith in vegas.  i was impressed...i was happy...i was glad to be back to vegas where i have the good, the bad and the ugly memories of my \"peak\" time!  this dining experience (not just the food) tops as one of my favorite moments in vegas.", 
            "this is my favorite steak house ever and iv tried all the steakhouses in oc/la... i always get the bone in rib eye (big enough to share) and a few sides...emerill's signiture banana cream pie is dayam good too...gotta get the side of muchrooms and finger link potatoes...once in a while they with serve their special <mark>Double Cut Kurobuta Pork Chop</mark> and i highly recommend you get it. its that good. i luv this place and cant leave vegas with out dining at this restaurant! thanks emrill!", 
            "this place was amazing, probably the best meal i have ever had in my life.  i came here with my boyfriend at the time, for an early dinner.  we arrived earlier than our reservation, so while we were waiting we were looking at the menu outside to see what we would have. \n\n i thought i had made my decision, but once inside we found out that the chef makes something special each day.  so of course this is what i decided on ordering, and so did he.  which i was a little bummed because i was hoping he would order something different so we can share.  our dish was served in a large bowl, and it was a sampling of pork, beef and chicken that was served over garlic mash potatoes.   we also ordered the <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> prepared table side.  this was very impressive and of course delicious.\n\nfor desert i chose the banana cream pie and he chose the <mark>Double Cut Kurobuta Pork Chop</mark> fudge cake.  they were both superb, which i wasn't expecting any less.\n\nthe service is impeccable.  i have never been to a restaurant this nice and i felt like a queen for the time that we were there.  there were just two of us, but be had three servers attending our table.  while we were waiting to be seated we sat in the bar and we were watching a basketball game.  the maitre d' noticed and kept us updated throughout our dinner with the score.", 
            "came here with a group of 16 for the fiance's 30th birthday weekend -- 14 adults plus 2 little kiddos (ages 4 and 6).  the service was outstanding!!!  our group of 16 had to be split into 2 circular tables next to each other which made it really difficult to socialize w/each other.  however i really really appreciated how attentive the waiters were, and they treated my little nephews really well too.  i was pleasantly surprised when they offered the boys kids meals consisting of grilled cheese sandwiches and french fries :)\n\nnow...for the food review.  first off i must clarify, i do not eat beef so my review is for the lamb chop.  lamb is usually a gamble for me because i only like it if its cooked right and does not smell lamb-ey.  my lamb chop was ehhhh.  the meat portion was huge, but only the outside was tasty.  the entire inside of my meal was verrrrry gamey -- which i do not like.  we ordered the <mark>Delmonico Creamed Spinach</mark>, potatoes, and mushrooms to share.  they tasted like --- <mark>Delmonico Creamed Spinach</mark>, potatoes, and mushrooms.  really nothing special.  everyone else seemed to enjoy their steaks, but if there's a next time maybe i'll try the <mark>Double Cut Kurobuta Pork Chop</mark> instead.", 
            "i took my wife here for our anniversary last year. the service was outstanding (i think we had three waiters just for our table) and the food was excellent. i had the <mark>Mediterranean Sea Bass</mark> and she had the <mark>Double Cut Kurobuta Pork Chop</mark>, both were cooked perfectly and tasted wonderful. for desert they had root beer ice cream and i swear it felt like it was carbonated. the decor was ok but they could do a little more.", 
            "the place? comfortable yet elegant.\nthe service? spot on.\nthe food? really good, but...\n\nsomething was lacking. i had been wanting to try one of emeril lagasse's restaurants for awhile and was really excited to dine at delmonico, but the food didn't blow me away like i had expected it to. their gumbo was good, but lacked a bit of salt. their <mark>Double Cut Kurobuta Pork Chop</mark> were good, but could have been a little more tender. my friend noted that the texture of the steak was a bit off. their desserts were good, but the chocolate cake was kind of dry. everything was \"good\", but nothing was great. wait...i take that back - their dinner rolls were delicious! \n\nalthough i really enjoyed my delmonico experience overall, i don't think i'll be returning anytime soon. (i have yet to find a steakhouse that i like better than mastro's!)", 
            "truffle and parm chips are a must have.\n\nthe little dinner rolls they pass out are awesome!\n\n<mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> was good, seafood chowder was good.\n\nbone-in rib-eye was tasty. cooked well, flavored well.\n\n<mark>Double Cut Kurobuta Pork Chop</mark> was pretty whatevers though. probably can skip out on that one.", 
            "that <mark>Double Cut Kurobuta Pork Chop</mark> is the best i ever had, and we discoverd a fantastic bottle of peju in the wine list.", 
            "delmonico steakhouse is the best steakhouse i have ever been to. hands down. nothing else compares. i have been going to this steakhouse for the past 8 years. pretty much every time i visit vegas; we find a way to to have dinner there. i have tried the <mark>Double Cut Kurobuta Pork Chop</mark> for dinner. but my \"go to\" entree is always the rib eye. it is done to perfection. always expertly cooked and seasoned. tender and almost melts in your mouth. the sign of an excellent steakhouse - is that your steak is always cooked to order and does not need much in the area of extra sauces. your steak comes with an assortment of emeril's sauces. i have never needed them and prefer to eat the steak \"as is\". service is impeccable. your drinks are brought quickly. your water glass is never empty. entrees and side dishes are delectable beyond your dreams. also, the most amazing banana cream pie i have ever had the pleasure of eating in my life. trust me. spending money at delmonico steakhouse is well spent and i doubt you will be disappointed. it is a true dining experience.", 
            "yes i love this place and i want to go again and again.   the value is also very good and where it should be.   note to all: the <mark>Double Cut Kurobuta Pork Chop</mark> is now called \"ham chop\", it's still my favorite item on the menu and i think the country's best piece of swine.", 
            "impeccable service, amazing food, & super easy accessibility when staying at the palazzo means 5 stars all the way in my book.\n\nbut the fooooood alone deserves 5 stars:\n\ntuna & <mark><mark>Ahi Tuna</mark> and Salmon Tartare</mark> - very fresh tuna & <mark><mark>Ahi Tuna</mark> and Salmon Tartare</mark>, each delicately seasoned, with a bit of wasabi sauce & seaweed salad in between.  a lightly dressed cucumber and red onion salad with the tiniest seasame seeds sprinkled on top added a nice vinegary element.  and crunchy wonton chips were perfect to scoop up everything with.  great texture & flavor!\n\nbone in ribeye - a seared perfectly, served medium rare, herb butter topped, giant steak.  classic.  awesome.\n\napplewood smoked double cut kurobuta ham chop - i'm not a big fan of pork so if i say that i loved this, it's a big deal.  this <mark>Double Cut Kurobuta Pork Chop</mark> had seared, caramelized, fatty edges, and was perfectly seasoned.  this was the juiciest <mark>Double Cut Kurobuta Pork Chop</mark> i've ever had.  served with pecan-topped, candied sweet potatoes that are a must eat with the chop, & a cider reduction.  the combination of savory, sweet, buttery, meaty, pecan-y, brown sugary, and slightly hammy flavors together were amazing.  emeril knows his pork!\n\nwild mushrooms - a generous mess of delicious mixed mushrooms.  yes.\n\nbanana cream pie - a ridiculously impressive-looking presentation, crazy tall!  thin & slightly salty crispy graham crust, tons of freshly sliced bananas, able to reach such heights because the pudding was more cheesecake-y texture & acted as banana mortar.  topped with fresh whipped cream, a drizzle of caramel, & a few chocolate shavings.  you'd have to be crazy to attempt to eat this alone!\n\nthis was definitely a dinner to remember, and that ham chop is something to spread the word about.  get it!",

            "we got here at 730pm with reservations at 8pm, so we waited for a little bit in their \"lounge.\" here, i asked for water, and the waitress gracefully brought me a glass, even though we were probably expected to order an alcoholic beverage. we waited about 15 minutes in their lounge, and then a waitress took us to our seats. the restaurant was surprisingly large, and we were seated in the middle of the back room. i was surprised at the decor, it was rather.. plain.  plain white walls with dim lighting.. it kind of felt like we were just being seated in a large room. after sitting, the waiter explained to us about the menu, and then left a very large book of alcoholic beverages for us to look over as well.  the menu wasnt too large, which was good for indecisive people like us. :)\n\nto start, we ordered a <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> ($12.50) to share, esp after reading the rave reviews about it here. like i said, not hyped. it was sensational. it was so smooth, creamy, and rich, mmm.. i'm drooling right now just thinking about it. for our entrees, i ordered the <mark>Colorado Rack of Lamb</mark> ($48) with a side of <mark>Roasted Fingerling Potatoes</mark> ($9), and the friend ordered one of their specials of the night--blue cheese covered bone-in filet with bacon ($55) with a side of saut\\u00e9ed <mark>Sauted Garlic Mushrooms</mark> ($9). i'll start with the sides. the potatoes were okay.. nothing too spectacular.. a little bit on the salty side.. but it was a good side if you need veggies (or veggie-related) along with your meat. the mushrooms were good. tasty, cooked nicely, and i dont even like mushrooms! i ordered the lamb cooked to medium, and it was still slightly too red for me, but it was good nonetheless. a little bit on the fatty side, but it was tasty, and came with a popover.. which is this egg-battered bread thing that went really well with the lamb sauce. i actually had a bite of the friend's steak before i dug into my lamb, and boy.. that steak was fabulous! the blue cheese, bacon, steak, and tangy sauce that came with it made the steak utterly orgasmic. perfect blend of flavors. the meat practically melts in your mouth. friend got the steak in medium rare, but it seemed slightly more cooked than it should've been. it definitely didnt take away the tenderness though, this was the best steak i've had in my life (and i only took a couple of bites from it). this was one of the specials though, so it probably wont always be available. just writing about it right now is making my stomach grumble. i was craving to see what their desserts would taste like. we decided to go with the chocolate bread pudding ($10). it was really chocolate-y, but for chocolate-lovers like me, it was perfect. it was the cherry on top of an already great meal.", 
            "delmonico's is easily a 5-star restaurant, but not because there is a famous name (emeril lagasse) associated with the restaurant -- but because the food is simply exceptional. this is fine dining without the pretentiousness of stuffy, overpriced, mini-portion restaurants. \n\nwe happened to be staying at the venetian hotel & casino and made reservations to delmonico's, which is on the premises. there was about a 1-minute wait and we were quickly whisked away to a candlelit table. the restaurant itself is very simple yet elegant; nothing over the top, flashy or obnoxious. the lighting is perfect; not too dark and the wait staff is extremely attentive and prompt.\n\ndelmonico's is known for their steak; the bone-in rib eye steak. this slab of meat is prime and comes with a nice price tag. if you're at delmonico's -- ya might as well go for it, chump!\n\nfor starters, i had the <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> soup; thick, creamy and packed with flavor. i absolutely loved it! best <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> i have ever had. it came adorned with a polenta type cake in the middle. i am not sure if it was polenta or dried shrimp cake -  or even bread, but it didn't matter as it all happily made its way down my belly. \n\nwe also tried the crab meat cake; fresh chunks of crab atop a puff pastry and dressed with tomatoes, lima beans, asparagus and all sorts of good spring veggies. amazing! \n\ni decided to try the <mark>Colorado Rack of Lamb</mark> with the twice <mark>Baked Idaho Potato</mark>. jeff went with the rib eye steak and <mark>Baked Idaho Potato</mark>. the lamb was head-spinning! topped with a rich sauce and truffles! perfectly cooked and moist and tender and gaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhh! i can't rave enough. the steak was just as good -- even the fatty pieces were delicious. \n\nthe food, the service, the atmosphere, the attention to detail, the $25 corking fee -- all was worth the price. definitely a place to experience while out in sin city!",

            "i had dinner here on 2/7.  the last time i was here was over 10 years ago.  the last vegas steakhouse that i had eaten at was cut, so that is what i will be comparing my experience to.\nservice:  very good.  we had at least 3-4 servers taking care of us (party of 5) throughout the night.  initially dinner was for a party of 4.  however, once we were seated, our buddy landed at the airport and decided to join us.  i informed the head server (thinking that they may not be able to accommodate) and he immediately converted the table to seat 5 (pulled out stuff from the bottom to make it a round table).  water was constantly filled and table cleared off in appropriate fashion.\nfood:  we started off with the <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> and <mark>Ahi Tuna</mark>/<mark><mark>Ahi Tuna</mark> and Salmon Tartare</mark>.  i thought the salad was just ok.  a tad too much dressing.  same with the tartare.  nothing special and pretty bland.  most of the group got the bone in rib eye (medium rare to medium well).  all were cooked well.  i thought the medium rare tasty pretty good.  nothing spectacular about it, just good steak.  i had the <mark>Colorado Rack of Lamb</mark> (medium rare) and it had decent flavors.  i would take carvino's lamb chops over it any day.  the sides we had were decent (<mark>Potato Gratin</mark>, mushrooms, and corn).  we had a nice bottle of wine that the sommelier recommended with a price point of $85.  that was probably the best tasting thing of the night.\nthe verdict on delmonico's is that it is a decent steakhouse that it's reputation is based on its name more than its food.  i would choose cut over it any day.  they have more selection of meat (cuts and quality).", 
            "my mom lives in vegas so i am there all the time and we try a lot of the nicer restaurants in town.  delmonico steakhouse was one of the better ones.  we were a little early for our reservation so we sat in the bar and ordered a few drinks.  the hostess then called our name after only a couple of minutes so we did not get our drinks in the bar but they brought them to the table and added them to our bill.  it was a very smooth process.  for dinner, i had the fillet mignon with blue cheese melted on it.  it was delicious.  the steak was a tad undercooked for my taste but i did order medium rare.  i guess i was expecting the norm where other restaurants cook medium rare closer to medium.  but overall the steak was delicious.  good flavor and i loved the blue cheese.  my mom had the <mark>Colorado Rack of Lamb</mark>.  again a little too undercooked for her taste but they truly cooked it to medium rare.  we shared the twice <mark>Baked Idaho Potato</mark> with cheese and bacon.  yummy!  the bread was good too.  we had a great main waiter and his assistants.  everyone treated us well and in a timely manner.  definitely a place i will go again.", 
            "how does one spell grossly overrated...delmonico's!!! first, i have seen more originality in a denny's restaurant in terms of decor. this place is as boring to the eye as watching paint dry...that should have been my clue to exit right!!! there is no color, no cool lighting, no cool art, no great looking floors...nope, a two year old could have designed a more interesting restaurant.\n\nnow let's talk food. it is 3am and i'm on the toilet, let's start there!!! they hand me a steak they claim is prime beef. the only thing prime was the price...52 bucks! the meat was not only tough, but like the decor, it had no taste...none. cosco has better steaks then that thing they brought me. \n\nso they do take it back a i ordered <mark>Colorado Rack of Lamb</mark> for, yes, 55 bucks!!! now those little four rib racks were excellent...but not 55 bucks worth of excellence.  where's the meat! \n\nthen it is time to go to the bathroom...you won't believe it...a dirty, filthy two stall bathroom!!! and the road to the bathroom, and i purposely used the word road, was a journey in itself. how is it that a place that charges 55 bucks for a <mark>Colorado Rack of Lamb</mark> can have such a piece of s@&t bathroom? \n\nand as i sit here on the toilet at 3am all i can tell you is if you think this place is great, then you are from hoboken nj because this is a grossly over rated restaurant with horrible food, decor, bathrooms, etc. the owner is laughing to the bank with the fools who go here...avoid this place. \n\nthe restaurant manage reached out to me...good for them...but i'm not interested.  you get one chance to make your reputation, and mr. celebrity chef, you lost it here.  awful place!  grossly over priced!  don't waist time or money here!", 
            "food was excellent!!!!  the favorites of our group were lobster, ribeye, filet, <mark>Colorado Rack of Lamb</mark>.  salmon was a bit dry and halibut was just ok, but fine.  my personal standout for the many sides we got was the potatoes au gratin...i'm still dreaming!!!  our service was just ok until the end when our server scolded someone in our group and said \"sssshhhhh.\"   really???  if he was ruining something for other customers (which i'm sure he wasn't--others tables were toasting with us) than a manager should've come up and said something, not her.  i mentioned to the hostess we were a lively group and to sit us accordingly.  she assured me it was not a problem.  we spent a lot of money and ended on a sour note--which is no bueno....it could've been handled so much better.  also, they knew we were celebrating an anniversary and didn't bring a complimentary dessert??? (i think even cheesecake factory does that?).  it just seemed the waitress had a personality problem and didn't like us from the get go. unfortunately, this is the second visit here where the service has fallen short.  four stars for food.  not in a hurry to go back.  there's no \"sssshhhhh-ing in vegas!\"",

            "food amazing, mushrooms and <mark>Colorado Rack of Lamb</mark> were excellent. <mark>Truffle and Parmesan Potato Chips</mark> so addicting! i had made an advance reservation and made a comment that it was my boyfriends birthday and asked for a special table. when we arrived the hostess seated us at a table 2 feet from other guests on one side and up against a wall on the other side. when i asked her if they had a nicer table she said that the dining room was full. then she looked around and asked what table i wanted. i told her that i had requested a nice cozy table when i made my reservation. i was disappointed in the location of the table especially since i had made that specific request. she then moved us to a table that was right next to the entrance and sound volume buttons/lighting controls of the restaurant. it also was not what i expected but at least we weren't right next to another group. throughout dinner the managers were constantly walking by and playing with the volume buttons and lighting buttons on the wall. on a good note , our server and the food was exceptional however i have been to several fine dining restaurants and was disappointing that my small request was not granted. it's the little things that make a difference."

            "by far the best steak i have ever had. we had dinner here to celebrate a friend's birthday. they met a few requirement we needed, a late reservation and corkage. most places in vegas don't do corkage and he was super attached to the wine that he brought. \n    the service was incredible. they were so attentive and well versed when it came to the menu. out of the 6 people we had with us 5 were or are in the food industry. the man was an executive chef and the rest are fine dinning servers. our servers kept them very happy. \n   the man and i shared the cesar salad for two prepared table side. i had the fillet <mark>Oscar Style</mark>. it was honestly the best steak i had ever had. they were very generous with the crab and asparagus. the rest of our party dinned on rib eye, <mark>Double Cut Kurobuta Pork Chop</mark> and the day's specials. it was all amazing. we finished off the meal with a banana creme pie. i don't really like banana cream. this was outstanding. real sliced bananas with fresh creme, my god! \n   when the bill came were pleasantly surprised at how reasonable it was. a little over $500 for 6 people and 3 bottles of wine.  \ni can't wait to go back!",

(also they only have white napkins.. i'm used to fine dining where your napkin, either white or black, be offered to go with your ensemble.)\nnext, our server(s), didn't seem to care that we were dining there.  not sure if they judged based on skin color, age, and style of clothes, but it felt like they did.  after offering us drinks and giving us menus, it was about an 8 to 10 minute wait to see our server again.. mind you that we'd chosen what we'd have for dinner and had our menus closed a majority of that time.\noverall for service from beginning til end was way below par for such a place.  we did not feel welcomed nor that they gave 2 funks about us.\nfood:\nmy bone in rib eye was ordered medium and came out medium well, which made it particularly dry and tough.  my spouses bone in rib eye was cooked correctly (medium), but was nothing to call home about.\ni ordered my steak <mark>Oscar Style</mark>.  the asparagus was the highlight of our dinner and the crab seemed a but overlooked and dry.\nwe also had a <mark>Roasted Maine Lobster Tail</mark> each, which came de-shelled and on top of the rib eye.  drawn butter was brought out but lemon was not, nor offered.\nwe had the new orleans style <mark>Delmonico Creamed Spinach</mark>.. the only \"new orleans\" about it was the name.  the spinach tasted fresh but it was about a 3.5/5 on overall taste and quality.\nfor the price there are many better options in las vegas (mastro's ocean club; the capital grille, del frisco's..).  \nwe will surely never return.",

            "i blame my father for my inordinate love of all things gourmet. thankfully, i appreciate a good burrito as much as i appreciate a good steak, but i will definitely seize every opportunity to dine in style as much as i can.\n\nthanks to a family trip to vegas, i got to eat at emeril's, once more partaking our family's favorite pasttime: eating. we had eaten at the original location in new orleans when i lived there, and it was one of my top 5 dining experiences of all time. this one definitely tied that experience.\n\nas other people have said, if you're not going to eat steak in some form when you come here, you're wasting your time. the steak is truly a peak experience for meat lovers. we all ate our  steaks in silence, save for the \"omg!\" and \"mmmm!\" and \"wow.wow.wow.\"  they all had the <mark>Filet Mignon</mark>, and i had the bone-in dry aged ribeye: the best steak i have ever eaten in my life. it came on a bed of perfectly creamy garlic mashed potatoes and <mark>Pan Seared <mark>Foie Gras</mark></mark> butter just melting into it. \n\nhave you ever had lightly tempura battered asparagus? it's worth coming here just to try them. \n\neven the sides- delicious spinach he made without cream that was still good (shocking, i know), and broccoli cooked to perfection...we all kept remarking how absolutely everything was just perfect.\n\nthe other thing that distinguishes restaurants like this is the service.  places like this are in a whole other league- waiters who seem to read your mind, appearing and disappearing before you even realized you needed something - never interrupting conversation, never hovering, always classy and helpful. our waiter chose the perfect wine for us with with the vague descriptions of what we were looking for, and it truly was the best complement to our meals ever. \n\nthe design of the room is also a refreshing breath of fresh air from all the gaudy glitz and obnoxious 'bigness' of vegas; simple, clean lines and understated elegance and chairs that make it seem like your table is totally self-contained and isolated from the other tables. great to have that feeling of privacy.\n\nwe lingered for hours just basking in the glow of such perfection and decadence.", 
            "i am going to preface this review by saying that we were given free desserts and a special appetizer from the chef. this was due to my sister knowing the general manager as she was a vegas concierge for many years. that being said, i thought the meal experience was outstanding.\n\nwe were celebrating an anniversary and there were seven of us including a 7 year old. the waiter brought the aforementioned free appetizer, a steak and blue cheese  croquette and <mark>Pan Seared <mark>Foie Gras</mark></mark> with cherry compote. not bad. i started with the baby greens with fried mozzarella. the lettuce was decent, the mozzarella cold and disappointing. \n\ni asked a waiter, not ours, what she recommends and she said easily the rib eye in bone. it saved the meal. as juicy as any steak i've ever had, and spiced to perfection with a dollop of butter melting on top. my wife enjoyed the 2 pound lobster and had started with the <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> which she also devoured. the sides were ok. i had the twice <mark>Baked Idaho Potato</mark> with bacon and cheese, but also sampled the french fries, which they specially made for the 7 year old, and they were quite good.\n\ndessert, since it was free, was a virtual sampler platter. the pecan pie was excellent. the bread pudding was disapponting - i've never tried it with cubed up bread with sauce on top and not enough to reach the bottom and served with oreo ice cream and chocolate magic shell. i sampled three flavors of ice cream and gelato and disliked them all, they tasted like ice milk.\n\nthe service was impeccable. never a want. and the price was not bad, $325 for 7 people but if i included the freebies then it would have touched $400. bottom line is i'd go back if staying at the venetian but would try others if not.",

            "the ben:  this is my steakhouse when i'm in las vegas. why?  well, i usually stay in the palazzo, but they have some pretty amazing steaks.  they start you off with these fresh out of the oven dinner rolls that you can never get enough of, but watch out that you don't fill up on it.  the steaks are worth skipping some bread for.  i always go with the aged prime ribeye on the bone.   it never disappoints and this time since there is a ban of <mark>Pan Seared <mark>Foie Gras</mark></mark> in cali i opted to try it for the first time as a topper.  please don't mock me for never trying the foie, well i can you can, but as a yelper/foodie i had to try it for my street cred.  i thought it was okay, i just i'm not as much as a foodie as everybody else.  it was just some extra fat for my steak.  i would recommend the banana cream pie for dessert, it was amazing!  bravo!\n\nthe bad:  only thing i would say it that you will be having a slow dinner.  i think we were there for a few hours.\n\nthe ben:  get the ribeye, pie and prepare for they long night of eating.",

            "i'll start out by saying the service and environment were both great.  delmonico seems to draw a good balance between those hyper-formal restaurants where utensil etiquette matters and more casual fine dining restaurants. \n\ni tried the <mark>Pan Seared <mark>Foie Gras</mark></mark> and octopus appetizers.  the octopus was delicious and had a decent amount of meat.  the <mark>Pan Seared <mark>Foie Gras</mark></mark> was rich.  i followed these with the gumbo which had a mild spiciness that anyone should be able to enjoy.\n\nthe disappointment occurred during the main course.  three of the people in our party ordered the <mark>Filet Mignon</mark>.  two of us were immediately dissatisfied with the plate.  i had ordered medium-rare and my dissatisfied friend had ordered theirs rare. my filet was noticeably dry and neither were especially tender. i suspect mine may have been overcooked because the third filet was also a medium-rare and the butter on top of their steak was still present, whereas mine had altogether melted by the time the plate reached our table.    additionally, whatever seasoning was used for my filet was not spread evenly.  there was only one bite where the seasoning became obvious and it overwhelmed the flavor of the meat.\n\nfor a steak that costs over $50 at an establishment that is a steakhouse, i hold it to certain standards, like being appreciated by a majority of the people at my party who ordered it. i can understand one person not enjoying their steak at a table because they have specific preferences, but for two people at the same table to be dissatisfied makes me believe the quality of the cooking is unreliable.  i have definitely cooked better steaks than the ones i tried  during this meal, and unfortunately this is the first steakhouse i have been to where that has been the case.",

            "had my second visit here recently during a long weekend in vegas.  the food, service and prices were right on point!\n\n$55 for the bone-in rib eye is a steal.  it is huge and enough to feed two people.  needless to say, my party of 4 ordered way too much food.  we had two bone-in rib eyes ($55 each, probably about 20 oz. each), the flounder ($40), <mark>Emeril's BBQ Salmon</mark> ($36), sauteed mushrooms, asparagus and mashed potatoes.  the only thing i wasn't crazy about was the mashed potatoes.  it had a pasty texture to it.  i prefer my mashed potatoes fluffy.  we topped off the night with a slice of the banana cream pie.  omg -- i had it three years ago on another visit and hadn't stopped thinking about it.  i wish we hadn't ordered so many entrees so i could have had my own slice!\n\nwe asked for both steaks to be cooked medium.  it was a perfect medium!\n\ni seriously can't wait to go back to vegas.  emeril never disappoints so i find myself frequenting all of his establishments in the city. \n\np.s.  the lobby area is nice.  lots of seats and big screen tvs.  we topped off the night by watching the end of the usc-nebraska holiday bowl game.  go trojans!  we won... barely.  phew.",

            "perhaps one of the best meals i have had! service was excellent and very attentive. the petite rib-eye with bacon wrapped shrimp, garlic mashed potatoes with a sweet tomato reduction was more than excellent! the appetizer of <mark>Ahi Tuna</mark> and salmon tar tar was very tasty as well. my husband had told them that we were celebrating my birthday prior to our arrival. they didn't make a big fuss, but greeted us with a yummy mini-mushroom tart to start our meal and ended it with a creamy cheese cake and wished me a happy birthday in a very descrete way :-)  -- i'm not one for loud signing and being the center of attention.  delmonico's is a very nice, classy place. we will be back for sure!", 
            "my group and i were congregating outside in the bar area prior to our reservation and i was called by name to be seated which was very nice.  the dining room is actually more like one large hall way with two adjoining rooms.  you get about 2-3 waiters per table and they offer very good and attentive service overall.  so anyways on to the food review.  i ended up ordering the tuna/<mark><mark>Ahi Tuna</mark> and Salmon Tartare</mark> appetizer and the bone-in rib steak medium rare.  the tuna and salmon both were very tasty but the portion was rather small.  for $18, i would expect a little bit more.  now on to the reason why we dined here....my steak came out and it looked giant.  the overall taste of the meat was only decent at best.  i was really expecting a more flavorful piece of meat.  maybe they forgot to season it or just didn't put enough of emeril's spice?  i could tell though the meat quality was very, very good.  they advertise wet-age steaks, but i much prefer dry-aged steaks.  too bad my steak was only just okay and for $52 i didn't feel ripped off but more disappointed.  i thought about ordering the bone-in ny strip and regret it now.  i'd sacrifice little fat and marbling for some more flavor. the side dishes that our group shared were also just okay, nothing spectacular but not bad either.",

            "i was in las vegas with my fianc\\u00e9 while he was attending a wireless convention for his company.  i asked a friend to recommend a good restaurant to go to while we were there.  from his short list of about 5, we chose delmonico's.  delmonico's is at the venetian in the palazzo with about 50 other shops & restaurants.  attire was business casual.  the dining room was dimly lit and elegant.  they treat you with table side service, and very personal attention from no less than 3 attendants.\n\nthe wine list was impressive and started out with kevin's picks (the sommelier).  i noticed the by the glass section only had about 5 different wines on it. apparently this wasn't a by the glass kind of place!  their wine list also boasted many 'cult' wines like screaming eagle and harlan.  although twomey merlot was on the list, we soon found that they had sold out already.  our maitre d', lamont, said he was a very big fan and recommended it frequently.  kevin came by our table to meet us and said he wasn't aware they were out of the merlot and that he would be ordering more that week.\n\ndelmonico's is a classic american steakhouse with creole influences.  i couldn't decide between the crab cake, the <mark>Ahi Tuna</mark> & <mark><mark>Ahi Tuna</mark> and Salmon Tartare</mark> & the new orleans bbq shrimp so our waiter suggested the shrimp; said it was their signature starter and i was so glad he did.  it was amazing! i also had the filet. it was cooked perfectly, creole seasoned, medium rare (the color was consistently the same shade through the entire cut) and it melted like butter in your mouth. the service was exquisite.  there was a maitre d' & a waiter for every 3 tables and we were given a lot of attention.  for dessert, i had chocolate brioche bread pudding with hawaiian vintage chocolate ice cream & fudge. when our server came back to check on us, i thought maybe i had a look of sheer ecstasy on my face, but he had said he knew how good  it was and wanted to make sure i was enjoying it as much as he does.  we surprised lamont by telling him we were leaving him wine; he thanked us for our generosity.\n\ni am giving delmonico's 5 stars, each of which i feel they are very worthy of.  dining here was not cheap, or even close to being on budget, ($450 for 2 people) but it was fantastic.", 
            "had a great dinner here with some close friends. i had the filet, <mark><mark>Ahi Tuna</mark> and Salmon Tartare</mark>, and sauteed spinach. everything was very good and the steak was done just right. the only things that i thought were subpar were the bread rolls and the decor. \n\ni really enjoyed delmonico.", 
            "located in the restaurant/shopping area between the venetian and palazzo, this is a great steak place.  went with a group of friends and we all had 1 thing on our mind.  steak.  \n\nwe didn't order any alcohol since we were kind of recovering a bit from the night before.  \n\nfor appetizers, i had the <mark><mark>Ahi Tuna</mark> and Salmon Tartare</mark> which was good.  bunch of my friends had <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> which was rich but very good as well.  the rolls came with a small amount of butter on them and would taste great in the bisque, i'm sure.\n\nfor steaks, everyone went with either the new york or filet.  i had the filet topped with <mark>Pan Seared <mark>Foie Gras</mark></mark>.  the combination of the two was excellent and very flavorful.  i sadly had to leave some <mark>Pan Seared <mark>Foie Gras</mark></mark> left over because it was too much.  i tried the new york and that was great as well.  \n\nfor sides we had the potatoes au gratin asparagus.  i didn't have any of the sides, but everyone seemed pretty pleased with them.\n\nunfortunately, no dessert really jumped out at me.  everyone split the banana cream pie, but i passed on that since i'm not a fan of bananas.\n\nservice was great.  it was pretty loud though, so i couldn't really hear 2 of my friends who were across the table.\n\noverall though, excellent meal.",

            "4.5 out of 5 stars.  being an emeril lagasse restaurant, you had to expect the best.  \n\none of my previous reviews of an expensive steakhouse stated that i could not imagine paying outrageous prices for a steak considering there are only so many ways that you can prepare it.  with that being said i still believe that is true, however i did not pay for my dinner this night since it was for business :).  \n\ndelmonico's is located in the venetian resort and casino right across from the mirage.  i have always thought the venetian was one of the more classy places to go in vegas and delmonico's was no different.  we called ahead to put our names in for an 8:00pm reso but we got there early at 7.  some of us were dressed in shorts and flip flops, but since it was vegas i think thats why we got away with it.  after checking in they said they could seat us early and to take a seat at the bar to relax.  after ordering a few drinks, we were seated promptly by a very friendly hostess.  (on a side note, they have an extensive scotch list which includes some very rare 100 yr old scotch's for $150-200 a pop).  we sat down towards the kitchen and was greeted by a stunning blonde waitress...i believe her name was dale, but i could be mistaken.  \n\nwe took a look at the menu and this place is not cheap.  you are looking at around 50 bucks for a steak.  most of us ordered the ribeye which is my favorite cut of meat and you can either get it bone-in or not bone-in...22oz or 16oz respectively. we started off with bbq shrimp which is what they are known for <mark><mark>Ahi Tuna</mark> and Salmon Tartare</mark>.  both of these were fantastic.  our steaks came out quickly and they were cooked perfectly.  the sides here are a la carte and each could easily feed at least 4 people.  we got the garlic mashed potatoes and it too was quite delicious.\n\nall in all this place was amazing....they have a team of people, 3 to a table, to make sure your water is always filled, bread is on your plate, and that you have everything you would need.  \n\ni was mesmerized by our waitress and was inspired to tell her that she was stunningly beautiful.  she was an excellent waitress too haha.  \n\nif you are looking for a good restaurant in vegas i would definitely give this one a try.  be prepared to spend some money, but it was well worth it.",

            "the bone-in rib eye is easily the highlight of this steakhouse. the medium rare steak had excellent flavor along with the marbled fat that simply melted in my mouth. the oysters, <mark>Ahi Tuna</mark> & <mark><mark>Ahi Tuna</mark> and Salmon Tartare</mark>, <mark>Butternut Squash Ravioli</mark>, and bbq shrimp are all excellent choices for starters and the <mark>Potato Gratin</mark> is a good side dish to have the steak with. the wine list is very extensive, but if you're not up for all that intensive reading, they also have a very knowledgeable staff to make recommendations. i was a little disappointed with peppermint profiteroles which were a little too stiff for my liking. service was great and efficient. i must have had my water glass filled 7-8 times that night. pricing is relatively decent - entrees around $50 and starters/sides/deserts around $10-$15 each.",

            "i had dinner here on 2/7.  the last time i was here was over 10 years ago.  the last vegas steakhouse that i had eaten at was cut, so that is what i will be comparing my experience to.\nservice:  very good.  we had at least 3-4 servers taking care of us (party of 5) throughout the night.  initially dinner was for a party of 4.  however, once we were seated, our buddy landed at the airport and decided to join us.  i informed the head server (thinking that they may not be able to accommodate) and he immediately converted the table to seat 5 (pulled out stuff from the bottom to make it a round table).  water was constantly filled and table cleared off in appropriate fashion.\nfood:  we started off with the <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> and <mark>Ahi Tuna</mark>/<mark><mark>Ahi Tuna</mark> and Salmon Tartare</mark>.  i thought the salad was just ok.  a tad too much dressing.  same with the tartare.  nothing special and pretty bland.  most of the group got the bone in rib eye (medium rare to medium well).  all were cooked well.  i thought the medium rare tasty pretty good.  nothing spectacular about it, just good steak.  i had the <mark>Colorado Rack of Lamb</mark> (medium rare) and it had decent flavors.  i would take carvino's lamb chops over it any day.  the sides we had were decent (<mark>Potato Gratin</mark>, mushrooms, and corn).  we had a nice bottle of wine that the sommelier recommended with a price point of $85.  that was probably the best tasting thing of the night.\nthe verdict on delmonico's is that it is a decent steakhouse that it's reputation is based on its name more than its food.  i would choose cut over it any day.  they have more selection of meat (cuts and quality).", 
            "impeccable service, amazing food, & super easy accessibility when staying at the palazzo means 5 stars all the way in my book.\n\nbut the fooooood alone deserves 5 stars:\n\ntuna & <mark><mark>Ahi Tuna</mark> and Salmon Tartare</mark> - very fresh tuna & <mark><mark>Ahi Tuna</mark> and Salmon Tartare</mark>, each delicately seasoned, with a bit of wasabi sauce & seaweed salad in between.  a lightly dressed cucumber and red onion salad with the tiniest seasame seeds sprinkled on top added a nice vinegary element.  and crunchy wonton chips were perfect to scoop up everything with.  great texture & flavor!\n\nbone in ribeye - a seared perfectly, served medium rare, herb butter topped, giant steak.  classic.  awesome.\n\napplewood smoked double cut kurobuta ham chop - i'm not a big fan of pork so if i say that i loved this, it's a big deal.  this <mark>Double Cut Kurobuta Pork Chop</mark> had seared, caramelized, fatty edges, and was perfectly seasoned.  this was the juiciest <mark>Double Cut Kurobuta Pork Chop</mark> i've ever had.  served with pecan-topped, candied sweet potatoes that are a must eat with the chop, & a cider reduction.  the combination of savory, sweet, buttery, meaty, pecan-y, brown sugary, and slightly hammy flavors together were amazing.  emeril knows his pork!\n\nwild mushrooms - a generous mess of delicious mixed mushrooms.  yes.\n\nbanana cream pie - a ridiculously impressive-looking presentation, crazy tall!  thin & slightly salty crispy graham crust, tons of freshly sliced bananas, able to reach such heights because the pudding was more cheesecake-y texture & acted as banana mortar.  topped with fresh whipped cream, a drizzle of caramel, & a few chocolate shavings.  you'd have to be crazy to attempt to eat this alone!\n\nthis was definitely a dinner to remember, and that ham chop is something to spread the word about.  get it!", 
            "absolutely fantastic service, atmosphere, and food. we started with the <mark><mark>Ahi Tuna</mark> and Salmon Tartare</mark> and cheese plate and then shared the bone in ribeye. the staff was perfect - they doggy-bagged the cheese we couldn't finish and happily cut our steak in two. our sides were mashed potatoes and asparagus...delicious. the kicker was the mark up on the chianti we ordered was very reasonable, particularly for a restaurant of this price range.\nwe were in lv for five nights and this meal/restaurant won hands down.", 
            "i love delmonico's, i really do.  but this past weekend, it just didn't measure up.  i should have gone with my gut and given cut a try.  we started with drinks in the bar, which was fine.  our table for seven was ready on time, which is always nice.  unfortunately, our service was super average compared to what i've had in the past at delmonico's and at other comparable high end steakhouses.  my husband and i shared a salad for an appetizer.  we let the server know this when we ordered and in the past, we've had this served on two separate plates in lieu of having to divide the salad at the table.  unfortunately, we were given to salad plates and told we could split it ourselves.  \n\ni love a good filet, and unfortunately, my filet was very average.  it was cooked to my liking, medium rare, but it was served relatively cool, which made me think that our food was sitting for a while before it was served.  my mom ordered seared <mark>Ahi Tuna</mark> which was served completely cold.  the outer edges were completely cooled after the searing, which again, tells me that our food sat out for a while.  my husband and my brother both ordered bone-in rib-eyes.  when the food was served, they brought one rib-eye that had been split in two.  the server went back to the kitchen and they realized they made a mistake and brought out the other rib-eye, while using tongs to take the half from my husband's plate and added it to my brother's plate.  rookie move, seriously.\n\nmy family doesn't eat a ton of cards, so for sides we ordered two servings of the mushrooms, broccoli, and corn for my niece.  the server kept pushing for us to order a starch, which we insisted we didn't want- very bizarre, it's not like we weren't running up a pretty hefty tab.\n\nit was my mom's birthday and i really thought delmonico's would come through with an excellent experience.  the food was okay overall, but i really can't say that this meal met my expectations or anyone at our tables' expectations.  i've been to many emeril restaurants, maybe they went through a recent management change??  i don't know, i wish i could explain the extremely average experience.", 
            "took my fianc\\u00e9 here for our 5 year anniversary since he is such a fan of steak.  to be honest, i always felt that if you've been to one steakhouse, you've been to them all.  but that doesn't mean the food was any less delicious.  \n\nthe <mark>Truffle and Parmesan Potato Chips</mark> were crunchy and packed with flavor and the <mark><mark>Ahi Tuna</mark> and Salmon Tartare</mark> was delicious!  we also ordered the bone in filet, which was a little on the salty side but the meat was perfectly tender...but what i was extremely excited about was the <mark>Pan Seared <mark>Foie Gras</mark></mark> (banned in california).  the order of <mark>Pan Seared <mark>Foie Gras</mark></mark> was plentiful and just heaven paired with the steak.  \n\nthe service was impeccable, i never once felt forgotten.\n\nsigh, i guess i'll need to take that 4 hour drive everytime i'm craving <mark>Pan Seared <mark>Foie Gras</mark></mark>.....", 
            "we went to delmonico's in the palazzo/venetian for a pre-theater dinner.  while nothing was bad, it wasn't a four or five star experience, either.  the service was competent, and the restaurant decor is definitely upscale.  \n\nthis is an emeril restaurant, so they have some cajun/creole items on the menu along with steak and seafood.  i started with the <mark><mark>Ahi Tuna</mark> and Salmon Tartare</mark>.  a nice starter served with a small cucumber salad, but nothing extraordinary.  the <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> arrived after sitting on the pass for awhile, it seemed, as there was already a skin atop the soup.  it was a nice bisque, about what you'd expect at a steakhouse.  the petite iceberg wedge salad was, again, pretty standard with bacon and blue cheese.  i finished with the halibut served over what they call vegetable risotto.  it was good; maybe a bit overcooked, but i enjoyed it.  \n\nthe rest of the table ordered appetizers and steaks, and while they said the steaks were good...no fireworks to speak of.  i did try a bit of my gf's ribeye, and was actually a bit surprised that it was lacking flavor in my opinion.  the ribeye is usually very flavorful, but this almost tasted like a filet; tender, but without any real steak pop and just a hint of gaminess.  \n\noverall, especially for the price, i thought the food would have been a bit more inspired, but as it ended up it was just ok.  not a place i'd steer anyone away from, since the menu is diverse and the wine list very respectable, but if you're looking for something really special, i don't think this really hits the mark.  there are certainly better steak and seafood restaurants in vegas that are less, at, or a bit more than this price point that would be much better.  \n\ninterestingly enough, despite the restaurant's name...they had no delmonico steak on the menu.  i thought that was a bit odd, as well.  :)", 
            "juicy ribeye <mark><mark>Ahi Tuna</mark> and Salmon Tartare</mark> \n\nthe service was very good here. i really loved the ribeye, <mark><mark>Ahi Tuna</mark> and Salmon Tartare</mark>, and their complimentary bread. the price is decent for an upscale dining restaurant. \n\ni tried other dishes my friends got and they weren't as good. my friends didn't really enjoy their <mark>Filet Mignon</mark>. i tried the <mark>Double Cut Kurobuta Pork Chop</mark> and i thought the sauce was very salty. the bacon appetizer was good but tasted a bit salty as well. the creamed corn was very good but i didn't really like the bread crumbs on top of it. the <mark>Delmonico Creamed Spinach</mark> was just ok. the potato side dish was just ok too. \n\nif you have an occasion you are celebrating they give you a sorbet. they also gave us a small mousse type dish for being there for the first time so that was nice. the decor is simple and had a nice ambiance. it's a nice place to try in venetian regardless.", 
            "i'll start with this: i'm not a fan of emeril lagasse.\n\nwhy? i don't know. i've never really been a fan. when food network showed actual shows instead of guy fieri and his 90's hair, emeril, bobby flay, tyler florence, and giada ruled the network. oh, and michael chiarello, but i've been to his restaurant and that was phenomenal. that aside, bam! was the most popular saying in the food world, people flipped their shit over it, and now emeril has his face on every cheaply made saucepan and spice around grocery stores for twice the markup. i always thought he was off-putting.\n\nthat being said, this is a seafood/steakhouse, and it's upscale. i've been to cut, so i know that wolfgang puck is better than his canned soups. there's a chance emeril would live up to the (very pricey) hype.\n\nthe drinks were good - a cab and a pinot noir were actually quite nice, and the cocktails looked amazing. maybe your bar staff can teach your kitchen staff a little something about pride in their product.\n\nfirst up: the <mark>Vine-Ripened Heirloom Tomato Salad</mark> with burrata. am i supposed to eat through the thick, rock hard center of this tomato? are you serious? i paid $20+ for a salad that consisted of five slices of heirloom tomato and a dollop of burrata on top, and you're going to give me several slices that were pure unripened tomato? fuckin hell. i was disappointed. okay? so disappointed. come on, how fucking hard is it to serve a ripe tomato?\n\nfor the entree we ordered the wagyu ribeye and the <mark>Ahi Tuna</mark>. the tuna was fine - it was tuna. i'd opt for two pieces, as pepper crusted seared ahi for me can get overwhelming after a while (nigiri is a totally different situation). the battered mushrooms were a nice touch, as well as the sauce.\n\nbut the wagyu. okay, look. you're paying $90 for a fucking steak. for a steak that isn't kobe - please, for the love of god, don't confuse the two. and it's not big, it's small. is it wonderfully marbled with fat? yes! to me, it was great! i thought it was wonderful! but this is why my review just went down a star while writing this:\n\nwhen you pay $90 for a goddamn steak, you'd better bring it out hot. like, searing hot. like on a 400f plate like mastros, hot. right off the goddamn pan hot. when it comes out just barely hot anymore, and then slips right into lukewarm, what the fuck? what kind of $90 experience is that? the cow has given it's life, with the production of so many people trying to make it wonderful, and you ruin the experience. plus it was a little too salty.\n\nyou're probably thinking, \"jesus jaime, you're a bit of a prick, and a snob. i can see your brain from how high you're holding your nose from here.\"\n\nyeah, alright. i'll give you that. but you know what? i'm not going to pay fucking $90 for a goddamn steak if it isn't treated perfectly. i can get a $25 steak that's handled better than that, i don't give a fuck if it hasn't been drinking beer all its life.\n\nthen, to top off the evening of great disappointments, i ordered dessert. how hard is it to fuck this up? when you have a great meal, you want to finish it with a bang, right? so you have the one thing on the menu people like (apparently the banana cream pie), and then fuck it to the rest of the dessert menu, right? for fucks sake people, great dessert isn't that hard! it's so easy. even worse, it's the biggest profit maker! if you call that chocolate truffle cake a cake when it's drier than the sahara desert, and that strawberry shortcake as such when there was barely any actual shortcake, and the strawberries were mostly unripened with green parts on them, with a dollop of whipped cream on the side of the plate...then you should send your pastry chef back to school because clearly they need a kick in the ass.\n\nthis is an expensive meal where they prey off the idea that the people who come don't have any appreciation for the things they serve, so their level of care goes right out the 37th floor window of any hotel on the strip.", 
            "every year a group of us (we had 6 this year) goes to vegas and tries out the various high end restaurants (and one night it's always a steakhouse).\n\nthis year we chose delmonico's steakhouse.  we enjoyed a <mark>Seafood Tower</mark> to start (fantastic) and for the main courses a few shared the chateaubriand (\"it was unbelievable!\") and others had the <mark>Ahi Tuna</mark> (\"excellent!\").  \n\nin short - it was an excellent meal!  the service was top notch, the food was great and we would all strongly recommend it.", 
            "prior to our trip, a few of us wanted to do a steak dinner in vegas and we agreed on delmonicos. delving into the menu so i had an idea in mind of what i would be ordering, i became intrigued immensely when i saw that it was under emeril's.\n\nwe were fortunate to be seated a little early. the ambiance of course evokes an intimate and formal setting with the dim lighting. the decor was minimal and i felt there could have used some art pieces.\n\nlet me say the service was top-notch. although it is what you'd expect from such an establishment, very few places achieve such high marks imo.\nthe water glasses were never empty and it felt like we didn't really have a server but a rotation of different people that comprised the waitstaff. i counted at least 6 different people between taking our order, serving the appetizers, the main course, side dishes, wine, filling the waters and dessert. \n\nappetizer: <mark>Ahi Tuna</mark> & <mark><mark>Ahi Tuna</mark> and Salmon Tartare</mark>: superb. i liked how the cucumber salad complemented the tuna & salmon and came in a spiraled form. the wonton chips were crispy and a nice form used for stacking the tartare & salad on. the wasabi provided a nice bite and offered a different note with the tartare. \n\nmain course: ribeye (no-bone). some say the meat tastes better on the bone. in this case i found the ribeye to be succulent, juicy well seasoned and cooked to perfection. frankly i don't think it would have made much of difference if it was on the bone or not based on the flavor. adding on the butter on top was a nice feature to the steak. \n\nsides: all the sides were delicious and was about the right amount to share for 3 (4 if the people aren't big eaters. \n\n<mark>Potato Gratin</mark>: so good i couldn't stop eating it. \n\n<mark>Delmonico Creamed Spinach</mark>: no joke and the right balance of cream to tone down the strong taste of spinach was harmonic. \n\nasparagus: i'm not an asparagus fan but if asparagus always tasted this good, it might crack my top 3 favorite vegetables. had the right amount of salt and seasoning to create a more palatable asparagus. \n\ndessert: sorbet; 3 scoops, 3 flavors. strawberry, banana and the 3rd resembled coconut. i found the sorbet to be a more suitable and lighter offering vs. if it was an ice cream or gelato.\nclean flavors and the banana was surprisingly interesting given the fact its not something one often comes across.",

            "ordered the <mark>Seafood Tower</mark> at $130 came with <mark>Half Dozen Raw Oysters on the Half Shell</mark>, 2 <mark>Roasted Maine Lobster Tail</mark> split in half which were slightly overlooked and rubbery. a handful of shrimp which tasted farm raised and lacked a good wild shrimp taste. <mark><mark>Ahi Tuna</mark> and Salmon Tartare</mark> was great and the <mark>Alaskan Red King Crab Legs</mark> were great.\n\nwarm wilted spinach salad ($15) came out with a deep fried soft boiled egg and bacon with candy pecans baked on it. there was spinach in there but a 2000 calorie salad isn't really that much of a salad. still it was good.\n\nadded to that the bone in 45 day aged ribeye ($50). that was magnificent. huge, flavorful and all around award winning.  had the <mark>Delmonico Creamed Spinach</mark> ($10), creamed corn ($10) and <mark>Steak Fries</mark> ($10). the creamed corn want good. it was just bland. the rest were good.\n\nservice is exceptional. had a few tito vodka martina's with blue cheese olives as well jacob were expertly made. for 5 of us the total bill was close to $1000. be prepared to spend $$$."

            "yummy!  i didn't realize this was an emeril (the \"bam!!!\" guy on the food network) restaurant until i looked at the menu.  cherylynn n. made reservations for a friend's 30th birthday dinner celebration.  our reservations were at 7pm, but part of our party got lost so we were seated around 7:15-7:30pm.  \n\nambiance:\nwell lit, but dim which created a \"romantic\" setting for those looking for a date night.  as we had 9 people in our party, we were set up in the middle in umm...an oddly shaped table (see cherylynn n's description).  the restaurant was packed, but the noise level wasn't too loud.\n\nservice:\ngreat service!  the waitress was very attentive.  when the food was brought out, there were 5 servers which each carried our entrees in each hand and simultaneously placed them in front of each of us at once.  it was truly a sight to see.\n\nfood:\n**note: most dishes are ala carte, so you'll probably want to order sides.  sides are big enough for 2-3 people to share**\n\n-crab bisque ($12) - delicious, creamy, and full of yummy flavor!!  this was on the chef's special list, therefore i am not sure if they have this on a regular basis.  the bisque soup is the same as the <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark>, but instead of lobster pieces, its generous portions of crab.\n\n-jumbo <mark>Roasted Maine Lobster Tail</mark> ($48/market price) - as i am not such a big meat eater, a <mark>Roasted Maine Lobster Tail</mark> was my alternative.  i didn't expect such a generous sized portion to come out.  it was heaven!!  delicious!!  tender!! \n\n-<mark>Delmonico Creamed Spinach</mark> side ($9) - it was good, but didn't have the additional pieces of bacon that most restaurants have.  you could definitely tell the spinach was fresh though.  \n\n-creamed corn side ($9) - yummmmmmm!!  i must come back especially for this side!! the corn was so sweet with a light crust on top.  words cannot describe how yummy this side was, definitely a must try!!\n\nso i know this is a steakhouse with steak, of course, being their specialty.  my friend insisted that i try some of his rib eye.  i'm not a meat person, but i will admit that it was tender and full of flavor.", 
            "\"wow!!!\" that's what she said... literally! lol, actually that's what we all said after we took our first bite into the appetizer (bbq shrimp). let me back track a little bit though. i made a reservation for four on open table... we were running a little late so i called and to let them know. they were very friendly and accommodating with our late arrival. as soon as we get there, they said \"you must be jason, party of 4 correct?\" very nice touch for a first impression. we were greeted by our main server, followed by the assistants. our server made good conversation and awesome recommendations. we never felt bugged, rushed, or belittled (since we all look pretty young). even with the huge wine list, we were scratching our heads and our server recommended a very good syrah that fitted within our budget.\n\nbetween the 4 of us, we ordered the bbq shrimp, <mark>Filet Mignon</mark>, <mark>Roasted Maine Lobster Tail</mark>, and i ordered the rib eye. seriously, every bite was wow! cooked to exactly the way you ask!!! you have to try it for yourself and you'll understand the wow factor this restaurant has!\n\nwhile making my reservations, i noted that it was a special dinner for me and my wife, along with my friend and his wife (our anniversaries of dating). lol...anyways, when we were about to ask for our check, the staff came out with two bowls of fresh strawberry sherbert/sorbet with a candle in it, followed by the words \"happy anniversary to you both and thank you for coming to delmonicos\"! i wanted to stand and applaud! hahahah our server then went on to take our digital camera's and take a couple pics of us.\n\nif you're looking for a restaurant with that wow factor (and you love meat), i highly recommend visiting delmonico's.",

(also they only have white napkins.. i'm used to fine dining where your napkin, either white or black, be offered to go with your ensemble.)\nnext, our server(s), didn't seem to care that we were dining there.  not sure if they judged based on skin color, age, and style of clothes, but it felt like they did.  after offering us drinks and giving us menus, it was about an 8 to 10 minute wait to see our server again.. mind you that we'd chosen what we'd have for dinner and had our menus closed a majority of that time.\noverall for service from beginning til end was way below par for such a place.  we did not feel welcomed nor that they gave 2 funks about us.\nfood:\nmy bone in rib eye was ordered medium and came out medium well, which made it particularly dry and tough.  my spouses bone in rib eye was cooked correctly (medium), but was nothing to call home about.\ni ordered my steak <mark>Oscar Style</mark>.  the asparagus was the highlight of our dinner and the crab seemed a but overlooked and dry.\nwe also had a <mark>Roasted Maine Lobster Tail</mark> each, which came de-shelled and on top of the rib eye.  drawn butter was brought out but lemon was not, nor offered.\nwe had the new orleans style <mark>Delmonico Creamed Spinach</mark>.. the only \"new orleans\" about it was the name.  the spinach tasted fresh but it was about a 3.5/5 on overall taste and quality.\nfor the price there are many better options in las vegas (mastro's ocean club; the capital grille, del frisco's..).  \nwe will surely never return.",

            "it takes a lot for me to give 5 yelp stars to a restaurant. i'm the type of yelper that just loves to find things to hate about the restaurants i dine in. i love being critical, what can i say. but, as much as it pains me to say this, i didn't find one thing i hated about delmonico steakhouse. (argh!!)\n\nthe <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark>. excellent. best <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> i've ever had in my life. hands down. add a little bit of cracked pepper on top and you have a wonderful tasting starter complete with its generous portion of lobster meat. i should've asked for a second order of it.\n\nmy ribeye was perfectly cooked and flavorful. ribeye is usually a cut of meat with a good amount of fat on it. my ribeye had the perfect balance of meat and fat. fat means flavor, people! i was glad i didn't have to cut off too much of it from my meat. we ordered a side of <mark>Roasted Fingerling Potatoes</mark> (w/ whole garlic and fresh herbs) and <mark>Buttered Fresh Broccoli</mark>. these sides complimented my ribeye very well, but i'm being a little biased here because broccoli and <mark>Roasted Fingerling Potatoes</mark> are my favorite veggies (#1 and #2, respectively). i couldn't finish the massive 16 oz. piece of meat and the sides, so i took them all to go. i wound up eating the rest of it for breakfast the next morning. can you say best breakfast ever? yes.\n\napart from a patron at the restaurant that was loud and sounded like mr. krabs from spongebob squarepants, my dining experience here was top notch! i couldn't ask for more from the food, service, and ambiance. you're welcome, delmonico steakhouse...", 
            "fantastic!\n\nwent here with coworkers/industry acquaintances and i can honestly say this was, hands down, one of the best meals of my life.  not just the food but the amazing conversation.  and i was the youngest one, by at least 20 years. \n\nordered a rib-eye which was stunningly delicious.  my mouth is watering just thinking of it.  our table ordered several sides, <mark>Classic Steak Tartare</mark>, <mark>Buttered Fresh Broccoli</mark>, au gratin potatoes... all cooked to perfection.  \n\nwe had wonderful wine with our meal and great inspiring conversations...it was really refreshing to be out to dinner with people who actually enjoy going out to dinner for 3 hours.  i mean for me it's a dream...other people are always rushing me when we're out to eat so this was a blessing!!\n\nsaying that the \"service was impeccable\" is an understatement.  \n\nthis place is truly incredible!",

            "my bf and i were totally looking forward to dining at delmonico.  i like fancy dining, he likes meat, put it together and we usually go to a steakhouse.  however, i did look at the menu beforehand, and noticed there were no crab cakes.  i always have crab cakes before a filet!  so that's probably where the problem started.  i made a reservation a couple months in advance on open table, but even then i could only get a 5:30 rez.  i'm not sure of the entire layout, but it seemed like we were seated in a more private room, which was nice.  the areas we passed through were super loud (staff and wedding party of 20).  gorgeous giant leather seats.  we started off with the \"<mark>Creole Boiled Gulf Shrimp Cocktail</mark> with tomato horseradish sauce and homemade crackers\".  there was definitely some bam in the sauce.  very peppery and lingers.  the crackers were just as spicy, but why are crackers served anyway?  the shrimp itself didn't taste like it was prepared in any special way.  bf had a bone in strip.  i order one of the specials, kobe sirlon.  i'm sorry this had to be my first experience with kobe.  it was terrible.  pretty on the plate, thinly sliced, with sinewy strands running all through it.  i was mortified with all the chewing.  i partially blame myself.  i knew i should have stuck with my standard filet medium rare.  sigh.  and now i will probably never go back to delmonico.  the sides consisted of overly buttery <mark>Country Smashed Potatoes</mark> and tiny fried bay scallops (tasted past its prime to me).  we also ordered an additional side of asparagus, also too buttery.  emeril's banana cream pie was good though.  intricately placed bananas seemed to float between layers of banana cheesecake.  the service is decent, but a bit impersonal.  we made a huge stain on the white tablecloth with a piece of dropped meat, and i expected the server to make a joke at least.  total damage, including tip, no drinks, was $195.", 
            "i seem to have really good luck with emeril's restaurants. after my recent visit to delmonico's, i'm beginning to think he can't go wrong. from the moment we walked in the door, it was just instantly different from all the other restaurants we visited. we were greeted warmly, seated immediately even though we were early, and had friendly, attentive service the entire time. \n\nthe atmosphere inside delmonico's is not at all what i would have expected, but it is simple and lovely. the colors are warm, the lighting is excellent (especially at a steakhouse, i need to be able to see my food!), and the decor is plain and easy on the eyes (not a lot of decoration at all).\n\nwe started with some <mark>Truffle and Parmesan Potato Chips</mark> and a <mark>Vine-Ripened Heirloom Tomato Salad</mark> to share while we were getting settled. vince curled up with the wine list with a big, giant grin on his face. ah, so many choices to go with steak, but we can't really go wrong with chambolle musigny, so there you go, and we threw in a bottle of sancerre to start. \n\ni ended up getting emeril's famous <mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark>, vince got the filet, and phil and alexandra got bbq shrimp and mushroom medallions. we also got an assortment of sides, including spinach, asparagus, mushrooms, and garlic <mark>Country Smashed Potatoes</mark>. for someone who likes pure, unadulterated meat, my ribeye was about as perfect as you can get. cooked to my desired rare plus bloodiness, with a simple crust of emeril's essence, a beautiful quality cut without any tendons or gristle, just beautiful meatiness. vince's filet was similarly perfect, nice and thick and bloody, with a delicious cajun rub that enhanced the meat without overpowering it. i was impressed with alexandra's medallions - they were pretty large for medallions; they looked like big 4 oz filets in their own right. i'd had the shrimp before at emeril's seafood restaurant so that was nothing new but those were also good. the spinach actually tasted like spinach (rather than cream), and the asparagus was nice and al dente. \n\ni finished up with some pecan pie, a generous jamaica blue mountain espresso (i was impressed that the coffee list provided a wide variety of espressos from which to choose), and a cognac. too bad it was only lunch! this meal was certainly the highlight of our trip (in addition to being the best, it was also the least expensive). afterwards our server took us on a tour of the restaurant. next time we are definitely going to try to reserve the chef's table. i already can't wait!",

(it tasted like a combo of semi-sweet & bittersweet.)\n\ndrinks: pretty good.  they don't have a specialty cocktail list since they are very into being a traditional steakhouse, but my pineapple martini was nice.  \n\ndecor: very bare bones- the plain beige walls have no art on them, but that allows you to notice the very ornate architecture of the place, with high ceilings and arches everywhere.  i was too into my food to really care what it looked like though.\n\nservice: as always with emeril's restaurants- impeccable.  we had no less than 3 people taking care of us at all times: one to take our orders, one to bring our food, and one to take it away.  \n\ntip: share an entree.  i split the 9.5 oz. <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> with my friend and i'm glad i did.  the average portion is enough for 2 or 3 people.",

            "i really enjoyed the meal at delmonico's, but from the first impression to the last, i still felt that the ambience was a bit missing.  we walked by on our first day and toyed with the idea of going into the bar for the <mark>Classic Steak Tartare</mark> appetizer; this was on friday afternoon.  the bar seemed a bit reserved and not very happening, compared to the bars at b&b and others in the venetian/shops.  we kept looking.  then, when we had decided to go for a nice steak dinner on the sunday evening during our vegas trip, we looked at several options, including capital grille and cut, but this seemed the easiest, and most promising, given the amount of time we had.  we arrived ahead of our required arrival (10pm, we needed to arrive at 9:45) in more than enough time to get a pre-dinner drink at the bar.  the problem was, now their bar area was completely dead and looked somewhat like a closed coffee shop.  uh oh...  we opted for the bar across the way at b&b, which was very nice.  we came back for our meal.  waitress was very nice and professional; they seated us right away.  we got the tartare appetizer and the chateaubriand for two.  the tartare appetizer was good; uniquely served with not only a side of their own prepared mustard, but also chopped hardboiled egg, not raw, mixed in.  the tartare was quite good and attractively presented.  the chateaubriand was delicious, served tableside and cut there, with the <mark>Country Smashed Potatoes</mark> and the vegetable of the day, the green beans with drawn butter.  it was superb.  the meat was served approximately medium rare, slightly rarer in the thicker cuts.  the end cuts, of course, were slightly more well done.  it was a delicious meal for two and expertly seasoned.  we shared the cappuccino cheesecake for dessert which was a unique flavor combination of the cappuccino flavored cake, the hazelnut sauce/topping with the sugared lemon slice; the flavors all worked together, and the cheesecake was delicious.  i had wine (zinfandel) with dinner; excellent.  my husband got the mojito served with coca leaf syrup; also good.  overall the food was fabulous, the service stellar.  but, the ambience, a bit stiff, a bit stodgy; not as friendly as the palm in bh or at ruth's chris bh or morton's bh.  also the decor, a bit too expected, a bit too safe and upscale coffee-shop-ish.  the waitresses are also required to wear true menswear shirts and ties and i didn't particularly care for the masculinizing of a waitress just in an attempt for them to appear overly professional.  overall it ranks about a 4.25...i'd try it again, but there are too many steakhouses, and too little time.  a great meal, set us back over $200 for two with our drinks, appetizer, dessert and the chateaubriand.", 
            "while at vegas, our friends out of the blue, wanted to go eat at a nice restaurant for dinner since it was fight night and all the clubs would have a long line. they made the reservations around 4pm for a 9:30pm dinner, so making reservations last minute isn't a problem.\n\nthough we arrived on time, we had to wait at least 15 minutes to get seated, so we just waited at the bar. i thought the bar area looked better than the actual dining area itself. it was modern and sleek, with a piano situated at the far side of the room.\n\nour hostess took us into the dining area, where we were immediately greeted by our smiling waitress. very attentive, nice, and down to earth, explained the specials and menu to us. meanwhile, the busboys/girls gave us hot bread, which my filipino friends said tasted like filipino bread. it was topped with finely grated cheese and salt, and they loved it. our waters were constantly refilled before it was even half empty.\n\nwe all ordered either the rib-eye off the bone ($42), or the bone in rib-eye ($46). 14 to 16 oz. for the rib-eye. i tried both the steaks and they tasted the same to me. it was dry-aged 14 days, which you could tell when you sliced the meat with your knife. tender, flavorful, delicious! i loved that the sides were encrusted with pepper and salt. my other friend ordered the filet-mignon, which she could not finish. i loved how it melted in your mouth and it was also very flavorful. we got the <mark>Country Smashed Potatoes</mark>, the <mark>Baked Idaho Potato</mark>, and the <mark>Roasted Fingerling Potatoes</mark>. the <mark>Roasted Fingerling Potatoes</mark> tasted the best. i thought it was perfect the way it was salted. the other 2 potatoes didn't stand out to me. \n\ndecor was minimal and sort of disappointing. the bathrooms were kind of disgusting to me because it seemed as if they didn't clean it much. the meal was delicious, but i still love mastro's more! \n\nat the end of our meal, one of the waiters kept coming by our table asking us if we needed help with our bill (because we had a party of 9). he came five times. it was super annoying and it seemed that he was afraid we'd dine and run or something just because it was taking awhile for us to figure out how to calculate tax and tip and collecting money from people.\n\ni'd definitely come here again, but after i try other steakhouses in vegas!", 
            "one of best steaks i've had. definitely a solid 4.5 even better, i dined on <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark>, a bone in ribeye  steak w/ <mark>Country Smashed Potatoes</mark>, <mark>Sauted Garlic Mushrooms</mark> and <mark>Delmonico Creamed Spinach</mark>. \n\nmy steak was was cooked to perfection, juicy throughout. not to mention the little things such as the pat of compound butter that added that punch. the <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> was smooth and rich. the sides we're all great as well. \n\nthe pricing was fair, it is a la carte steakhouse after all thats what you come to expect at an establishment like this. service was just right, very attentive but at the same time the wait staff wasnt breathing down our neck. loved my experience here, hopefully we will back again soon!", 
            "my friend and i really wanted to try one of the best steakhouses in vegas, and people kept telling us about how great delmonico was, so we gave it a try. it was my friend's birthday dinner and she is a huge meat eater, i on the other hand don't actually like steak all that much, but wow! it is absolutely impossible not to enjoy your meal here. \n\nwe were in a rush because we had tickets to a show and we were already running late. we advised our maitre d' that we had barely one hour to eat dinner and be on our way. he went above and beyond to make sure we got service fast and made the show on time. not only was he absolutely efficient in making sure our food came out quickly, but he was also super friendly and attentive with us. \n\nour cocktails took no time at all to arrive and were done perfectly. we didn't have time to get appetizers which was a big disappointment, so we went straight for the main course. i had the rib eye and <mark>Country Smashed Potatoes</mark>, my friend had the fillet mignon and <mark>Roasted Fingerling Potatoes</mark>, and we also shared some <mark>Buttered Fresh Asparagus</mark>. all the food was top notch and delicious. my rib eye was cooked to a perfect medium rare, and was well seared on the outside. like i said, i don't particularly like steak but this was mind blowing amazing! i had a few bites of my friend's fillet mignon and it was melt in your mouth goodness. i don't know that it could be possible, but it was even better than my rib eye. amazing. \n\nthe sides were also very good, specially the <mark>Country Smashed Potatoes</mark> which were buttery and creamy. they had bacon and what i think were leeks in them. yum. the asparagus were cooked to perfection and seasoned just right. i did not try the fingerling but my friend said she wasn't overly impressed by them. \n\nmy friend was also surprised with an apple cider sorbet and a candle - for her birthday. the sorbet was delicious, light and refreshing. all in all our visit to delmonico was fantastic and worth every single dollar we paid. dinner here is pricey, but seriously if you find yourself in las vegas, you'd be crazy not to come here!", 
            "phenomenal!  came back here to celebrate a birthday and everything was what i expected and more.  my requests for a particular table were all handled without any problems.  \n\ni am usually a <mark>Bone-In New York Strip</mark> guy, but i was hungry so i opted for the bone in ribeye for the first time here.  birthday girl had the <mark>Filet Mignon</mark>. sides included <mark>Country Smashed Potatoes</mark> and broccoli. \n\nbone in ribeye: humongous! probably 20oz. +  beautifully crusted, with just the right amount of seasoning. steak as always, cooked perfectly medium rare, which made for an amazingly juicy and flavorful experience. \n\n<mark>Filet Mignon</mark>: now normally i am not a filet person, but i did try a piece or maybe two.  beautiful crust and to my surprise it also had excellent flavor.  tender as you would expect from a great cut of <mark>Filet Mignon</mark>.  however, still not as juicy as my steak was.\n\nservice as usual, impeccable.  insanely large wine list, with almost every wine imaginable.  complimentary amuse bouche and bread are also delicious.", 
            "since this was my birthday trip we wanted(i wanted) a great steak dinner. as if i need a reason for a good piece of meat. we arrive 15 mins before our reservation and within 2 mins are seated. the place looks like an art museum very light and earthy colors. the seats are a bit uncomfortable as someone also stated. they are leather office chair styled, i kept sliding off of them. now enough of that, the food: the server: darren comes around and gives us menus we look it over- i see what i'm ordering- the filet $48, side $9 and i also want an appetizer $18 damn $80 and that's just my meal. now i'm used to spending this on sushi so i wasn't vexed. my poor husband who until me, wasn't used to spending so much on a meal was sweating. ha! i'm just kidding, so to be semi fair we order the gumbo $10 split, the bread they have is phenomenal a cross between hawaiian bread & monkey bread, and it gets served one by one for each person.  kind of annoying because it's that good but it comes out fresh so one can't complain. the gumbo is decent enough for a restaurant such as this. we order the chateaubriand $105 for a beautiful piece of steak, garlic <mark>Country Smashed Potatoes</mark>, and asparagus for two. bam! look @ me saving us money. this was our first time having the chateaubriand and this will not be my last, very well seasoned w/ herbs& spices and nice encrusted char. it was more than enough food for two. and @ the end of our meal they brought me a candle lit sorbet sweet treat for the bday girl. our service was top notch from start to finish. a well worth $200.", 
            "amazing steak, as well as some of the best service i've ever had at a restaurant.\n\nmy friends and i came here for dinner on a sunday (with a reservation, just in case), and we decided to split two steaks between 3 girls. we ehard that the portions are very generous, and we also wanted to try out the sides as well.\n\nwe ordered the bone in ribeye, along with the bone in <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> with a mushroom sauce (one of the specials of the day).  we also ordered the <mark>Truffle and Parmesan Potato Chips</mark>, as well as the <mark>Creamed Corn Gratine</mark> and the <mark>Country Smashed Potatoes</mark>.\n\nthe first thing to come out were the <mark>Truffle and Parmesan Potato Chips</mark>. sadly, for a girl who eats <mark>Truffle and Parmesan Potato Chips</mark> as her main meal frequently, i couldn't partake of them because of the parmesan (i cannot stand stinky cheese).  however, i did at least try one, and the texture of the chip (similar to a kettle chip almost), and the slight hint of truffle was amazing. however, the parmesan was still prominent, so i watched sadly while my gfs devoured the chips. i felt as if i was being punished, for some reason.\n\nluckily our steaks arrived at that point, and they were huge. it was definitely a good idea that we had decided to split two instead of each of us ordering our own.  our server (who's name i forgot), was incredibly helpful and nice. he brought over a carving table and after presenting the steaks to us, took them aside and carved them all for us.  we got our sides at that point too, and we just dug in.\n\nthe rib eye was incredibly flavorful. i tend to not normally order it because not all places will grill the ribeye properly and i end up with a slightly tough steak (even if ordered at medium). this one had just the right amount or pink, and the seasoning was mild enough so that the flavor of the meat shone through.  \n\nthe filet was also very tender.  while we were eating the filet without the mushroom demiglace, i decided to test it out.  the sauce is based on a reduction of veal stock, and it complimented the steak wonderfully. it didn't mask the taste of the meat at all but just added another dimension to it.  after urging my friends to try the sauce, we quickly started pouring spoonfuls of it over the rest of the steak on our plates.\n\nthe sides were very good as well. the creamed corn had a hint of spice due to some mined jalapenos that were in it. definitely a trick i am looking forward to trying at home.\n\nas great as the food was, i was also very impressed with the level of service. you would think that a fancy steak restaurant would be annoyed at the sharing of steaks, but they never batted an eye to our request (apparently a lot of people do this).  in addition, we never felt as if we were waiting to flag down a server whenever we needed assistance.\n\nfor everything we got, the meal itself also came out to be a lot less than i expected (although i'm sure it has to do with the sharing as well). however, we were so full and satisfied from our meal that we promptly fell asleep back in our room and decided against going out that night. that is definitely a sign of a great meal.", 
            "had dinner here and was pleased.  i had the bone in rib-eye and it was fantastic.  had the <mark>Country Smashed Potatoes</mark> as a side and they were pretty bland, expected a little more.  and also had creme brulee for dessert which was perfect.  overall it is very pricey, but had one of the best steaks i have eaten here so was worth it in my book.", 
            "** 100th review ** \n\ni had been anticipating this lunch for a few days. delmonico has been a favorite of mine but i hadn't dined there for a year. and, i was meeting esteemed london yelper yee gan o., who was on one of his dining and roller coaster trips across america. talking with yee gan was great. in fact, our conversation was so animated that our server asked if we wanted him to remain away, because we were discussing business. i told him that it wasn't business we were discussing, and he was thus welcome to hover over us. but, besides the consistency of the bearnaise sauce, the one complaint i have is that on this outing the waitstaff did not come close to hovering. i had to ask for a second roll, iced tea refills occurred but not too frequently, and an empty butter dish remained empty. this was in sharp contrast to my earlier visits to delmonico where i could barely get a glass down to half full before it was refilled, and when a new roll appeared as soon as an old one disappeared. the restaurant was not very crowded at all, so being too busy could not legitimately account for the laggard service. it wasn't so much our server but our assistant server who fell down on the job. he was responsible for refilling glasses, resupplying rolls, and making sure sufficient butter was available on the table. \n\nnow on to the meal itself! my <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> was very smooth, creamy, and flavorful, with a few morsels of sweet lobster to nibble on as garnish. it was all i hoped for! the <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> that followed was better than i expected. it was very tasty, with very fresh romaine lettuce leaves and long croutons that when broken spread cheesy garlic flavor all over the lettuce, to join with the parmesan splinters that were liberally spread over all. it was an excellent dish! \n\nmy <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> looked forlorn on the plate. only a large pat of maitre d' butter appeared beside it. a little pink blood was also pooled on the plate beneath the meat, which to me was a good sign. the prime grade filet was cooked almost all medium rare to order, but a few spots were closer to medium, and the steak was more peppery than i prefer. otherwise it tasted very good. it could have tasted even better had i not forgotten to order bearnaise sauce until the steak arrived at our table. that was my fault, and it probably contributed to the drama that followed. but the filet on my plate was not a $50 steak, which is what i paid for it. for that price--especially at lunch--i expect the filet to be great. this one was very good but not great. its size was not listed, but it was no more than 8 oz. \n\nour server immediately put in the order for bearnaise sauce, but it did not arrive for several minutes. he then made a point of telling me that the chef makes bearnaise sauce to order, and was preparing a new batch for me. a few minutes later, as i chipped away at more steak without any sauce, still no sauce had appeared. so i ate more of my steak, which was at least still tasty standing on its own. then the bearnaise sauce at last arrived, but it was runny and not very flavorful. it looked like it needed to set longer, so i left it alone for about two minutes, but the consistency remained thin after then. again, my tardiness in ordering the sauce probably caused the chef to rush its preparation, so i take partial responsibility for an imperfect bearnaise on this occasion. let this be a lesson to all diners: order bearnaise sauce when you order your steak--not when it arrives! \n\nas i ate my steak, i looked longingly at yee gan's lobster sliders, which looked delectable. but i'll let him report on that as well as the <mark>Traditional New Orleans Gumbo</mark> that he also ordered, which looked delicious as well, and that i have enjoyed before. but delmonico is first and foremost a steakhouse, and i wanted to review one of its steaks. (however, i may slip in again soon and order lobster sliders on my next lunch outing there.) \n\nmy side of <mark>Country Smashed Potatoes</mark> was a smash hit, with creamy red-skinned potatoes with a little of the skin showing, a few circles of green onion sprinkled on top, and including some very tasty lumps of potato that quickly dissolved in the mouth. i was going to take the remaining uneaten half of this quite large side dish home, it tasted so good--but forgot to do so, for which i am still kicking myself. for dessert, yee gan and i split a generous slice of emeril's renowned banana cream pie, which was top-heavy with whipped cream, filled with luscious pieces of banana, and also bedecked with chocolate shavings and caramel sauce. as i savored each bite, i tried to conjure up how to best describe the taste of this concoction, and one word stood out: \"heavenly.\" the only comparable banana cream pie i have eaten is the last one i had at delmonico. and, this one was better by a shaving. \n\noverall, a very good lunch with great company!", 
            "i was (again) lucky enough to have lunch here to participate in an it seminar for my place of employment.  when has a free steak ever turned me down?\n\ndelmonico was no exception, good food!  i had wanted to try this place before but eating like a king on a pauper's salary just didn't cut it.  emeril has done a great job with his steakhouse here in las vegas.\n\nthe presenters for this it seminar were smart, they decided to make us go though a big chunk of their product presentation before letting us start to partake in our steak lunch.  that was smooth guys...make us sweat it out!  but the payoff was pretty good.  our menu was one created by the folks doing the seminar, it was a nice three-course meal.\n\nwe started off with delmonico's <mark>Organic Baby Mixed Greens Salad</mark> - topped with creole spiced croutons, shaved manchego cheese, teardrop tomatoes, shaved red onions, and a sherry vinaigrette.  excellent salad, light, tart, salty, and the croutons and red onions (i love them raw if they're sliced really thin) gave it some nice crunch.\n\nnext we had the choice of either a steak or salmon.  seeing as i was in a steakhouse and that i-like-a-the-beef, i naturally went for a steak.  on the menu was a petite ribeye - which was charbroiled usda prime aged, creole seasoned, and topped with butter.  got mine in a nice medium rare.  boy oh boy, was this a winner!  tender, succulent, cooked right, a nice kick from the creole seasoning, excellent i say.  i usually like a steak sauce with my steak...but alas, i did not need it!  i sopped up every last bit of the beefy goodness.  the side of <mark>Country Smashed Potatoes</mark> were good too, but you can guarantee i kept my focus on that lil' slice of heavenly ribeye!  it's up there with one of the most tastiest steaks i've had, and this was only a mini-me of the full size!  i took a look at some of the other diners steaks that weren't in on our seminar, and they were huge!  delmonico definitely puts out a lot of meat for the money.\n\nwe ended the menu with a chocolate tart of some sort, i cannot fully remember it off the top of my head because i really wasted most of my brain power consuming that steak.  but yes, that tart must have been pretty good because i do remember finishing that as well!\n\nquickly looking at the actual menu, delmonico is on par with pricing as other steakhouses in the area.  most steaks are hitting the $40-50 range, sides are around $9 a pop, with desserts around $10.  not cheap so if you're going here make sure it's a special occasion!  but then again, if you are rich i guess everyday would be a special occasion.", 
            "went here with friends at 1030 p.m. following the marathon and amazed that they let my husband in while wearing his running attire as this is truly fine dining and he looked extraordinarily out of place.  after losing an undisclosed amount of money, i wasn't really in the mood to eat yet another expensive meal; however...\n\ni was prepared for high prices and adequate food but my oh my was i in for a pleasant surprise... at least on 50% of the expectations.  food fabulous and prices were indeed expensive but i have to say worth the full experience.\n\nmy husband shared the chateaubriand carved tableside for two, asparagus and garlic <mark>Country Smashed Potatoes</mark> for  $110 - same as the filet however, it comes with sides and costs less.  it was prepared perfectly and was delicious from the first bite to the last bite.  \n\nother sides folks had and loved were: new orleans <mark>Delmonico Creamed Spinach</mark>;  twice <mark>Baked Idaho Potato</mark> with bacon and vermont cheddar\nthe wine we chose (we asked for a med-full bodied red with a smooth finish and complex aromas that didn't cost more than $100 or $1000 (see photo of wine prices)  he actually suggested something for around $60 or so and it was exquisite!  \nchappellet mountain cuvee 2009.\n\nadd this to your to do list in vegas and go hungry!!  don't be shy to ask for a wine within your price range... they don't carry any bad wines so why pay a thousand bucks for wine?  loved this restaurant!", 
            "this place has the best filet i have ever eaten. that means a lot because i never thought anything could outdo my taste buds over hugo's cellar (which i still love very much). the service was excellent. we had reservations and were seated promptly.\ni enjoyed the asparagus with prosciutto wrapped around it they brought to the table. we must have had 3 different people checking on us. as i stated i had the filet and garlic <mark>Country Smashed Potatoes</mark>. the filet melted in my mouth it was just so darn tender and flavorful.\n\nit was almost $55 for my portion and well worth it. i now know why this place wins so many awards for best steaks!", 
            "we came here for our one year anniversary dinner.   i was a little intimidated to eat at a place like this in vegas but once we were seated everyone was super nice and didn't make us feel like we shouldn't be there.   \n\nthe menu has a bunch of different things on it but the star of the show (as told by my waitress) is the beef.   husband and i knew we were both going to order steak before we even looked at the menu.   \n\ni ordered the ribeye with <mark>Country Smashed Potatoes</mark> and husband got the <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> with creamed corn.   the side were served family style and were more than enough for two people.   the creamed corn was fantastic.  it had little bits of jalapeno in it for the extra bam!  \n\nwe both ordered the <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> to start.   bisque was very delicious especially the lumps of lobster meat.   did you know during the summer the bisque is dairy free?  \n\nthe steaks were just okay.  asked for mine medium but it came out well done so i didn't find it that good.  husband also asked for medium but basically got a rare steak.   \n\noverall though the atmosphere was definitely upscale yet comfortable.  i want to compliment our waitress ...she was very friendly and fun.   check was $164 dollars for two people.", 
            "my boyfriend and i dined at delmonico for christmas. we arrived an hour before our scheduled reservation, as we were walking around the hotel, but did not want to wait till 9 o'clock, the time we had our reservation for.  fortunately, we had no problem getting seated right away.\n\nwe started off with the <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark>, which was creamy and full of flavor with large chunks of lobster meat.  for our entree, we each had the bone in rib eye (i had the lobster with my steak) with saut\\u00e9ed <mark>Sauted Garlic Mushrooms</mark> and <mark>Country Smashed Potatoes</mark>.  our steak was cooked to perfection (medium well; pink on the inside, brown on the outside).   side portions are big enough to share with 2-3 people and even have some left over to take home.  we ended our evening with the duck egg cr\\u00e8me br\\u00fbl\\u00e9e.  my only complaint about the dessert is it was served completely cold.   i've had cr\\u00e8me br\\u00fbl\\u00e9e in many restaurants, and i typically have had it served at room temperature, as the sugar is torched right before it is served.  \n\ni cannot express enough what great customer service wait staff provides at delmonico!  staff was incredibly attentive.  they have three servers waiting on you.   they constantly check on you and top your drinks off.  \n\nlike most fab steakhouses, delmonico is pricey.  with tip, our tab was $300, but it was absolutely worth every penny.  \n\nlike i previously mentioned, our dinner was delicious, but what made our experience even more amazing was the staff.  i have never experienced such great customer service.  \n\nwhen in vegas and you're craving steak, delmonico is a must!", 
            "unbelievable. delmonico's was an unforgettable experience from start to finish.  we went there with a group of six to celebrate a 30th birthday. we called two days in advance to make a reservation (you can do it on their website too).  \n\nwe arrived and were seated immediately and it was then that i realized that it would be a dining experience. we had 4-5 servers around out table at any given time. we were immediately served water, delicious little bread knots, and out drink orders were taken. i thought it was interesting that they did not give a drink menu, rather the server recited all drinks in the given category to each person (wines: red or white, beers: ipa or stout etc). then they reviewed the menu with us and took our orders. there were many specials available, and they brought us a sample of a cheese tomato pesto flat bread, on the house. \n\nthe meal took a good 20 minutes, but it was worth every second (and dollar!). i had a filet, which was prepared to perfection. sides are a la carte, and family style. the green beans, potatos au gratin, and <mark>Country Smashed Potatoes</mark> were to die for. very very delicious.\n\nthis is hard to imagine, but the servers were almost too hovering. they filled your water after one or two sips. they definitely took care of us to any need. the prices are high, but worth it. delmonico's is something i will always remember about vegas.", 
            "previous to this review, i thought of delmonicos as a 5 star place, but there have been some changes that i really dislike. mostly the bread. they replaced those amazing parker house rolls with some nasty navajo fry bread, it's nasty, and greasy, and i don't like it.  \n\nother than the bread f*** up, i like delmonicos. the chateaubriand for 2 for $100 is a great deal! this is the real reason i come here. it comes with asparagus and garlic <mark>Country Smashed Potatoes</mark>. i add an order of saut\\u00e9ed mushrooms and am in heaven. \n\nthe service and atmosphere are also top quality, but because of the rolls being gone, i am giving this place a 3 star rating until they bring them back.", 
            "fantastic food, great service.  much more expensive than what we usually spend on dinner, but so yummy and worth it!  we both had steak for dinner, with sides of salad in the sherry ving., garlic <mark>Country Smashed Potatoes</mark>, and the pecan pie.  i wish we had room to finish the pecan pie, but could only get through half.",

            "so, after several years of not eating at an restaurant of mr. lagasse, i finally made it to delmonico's.  why might you ask?  well for one reason - the bone in aged rib-eye steak.\n\nthis was the third emeril restaurant that i've eaten at.  i used to live in new orleans and ate at his first restaurant, emeril's, and his casual outpost, nola, several times.  the food was good at times, not so great at other times, but the one thing that was constant was the excellent service.  \n\ndelmonico's continues that tradition.  the service is excellent.  at times, it's a little too friendly, but attentive and not overbearing.  food came out at a very good pace, allowing for long conversations without interruption.  and the decor is so understated and clean.  it really is a nice change from all of the typical vegas restaurants with loud lighting and faux-glam decor.\n\nbecause my girlfriend was so eager to try emeril's food (she's a big fan), we started off with some classics - barbecued shrimp (new orleans style) and <mark>Creole Boiled Gulf Shrimp Cocktail</mark> with remoulade sauce.  the lunch menu usually has shrimp remoulade over fried green tomatoes.  however, it wasn't on the menu and i really wanted my girlfriend to try it.  the waiter was nice enough to accommodate my request, learned they had some prepared and served it with the <mark>Creole Boiled Gulf Shrimp Cocktail</mark>.  to drink, she ordered a glass of loosen bros.  \"dr. l estate\" riesling and i ordered a glass of laurent perrier nv champagne. \n\nthe riesling was recommended by the asst. sommelier.  the waiter initially recommended an australian white blend.  but to me, it didn't seem like the best match with the barbecued shrimp because it lacked the acidity to cut the richness of the dish.  when i commented to the sommelier that i thought the australian white had viognier in it, he said it definitely did.  as we talked more, he said the riesling was a \"perfect match\" for the barbecued shrimp.  you know what?  it was.  my girlfriend wolfed down half of the barbecued shrimp, taking a sip of the riesling with each bite.  she even raved - it was a perfect match.  and she also loved the remoulade.  the barbecued shrimp were cooked well, i noticed one of the shrimp i had was a little tough, but the remaining shrimp were plump and juicy.  the <mark>Creole Boiled Gulf Shrimp Cocktail</mark> was great.  cold, large shrimp, moist, juicy and firm.  they were perfect with the remoulade sauce.\n\nfrom there, we split the bone-in rib eye which was cooked absofrigginlutely perfectly med-rare to med.  it wasn't charred, but had that crunch of a good high-temp seared steak.  the twice <mark>Baked Idaho Potato</mark> with bacon and cheese was sinfully great.  the asparagus was sauteed with garlic and shallots, cooked perfectly through with still a slight crunch.  we shared a half bottle of 2003 pine ridge crimson creek merlot which was a good match for the steak.  it had good balance, acidity, but enough soft fruit to please my girlfriend, who doesn't like tannic wines.\n\ndessert was banana cream pie for her, pecan pie for me.  both were excellent.  the banana cream pie wasn't as sweet as expected, which made it even more easy to eat.  she ordered an espresso martini made with espresso (not the flavored vodka), i ordered a glass of 2003 carmes de rieussec sauternes and finished with a cup of chicory coffee to finish.\n\nwas it inexpensive? of course not.  it was quite expensive.  but for the excellent quality of food (far, far, far better than gallagher's and probably the second best only to bouchon of the restaurants i've eaten at in vegas) and the best service i've had in vegas (yes, better than bouchon), it was worth it.  \n\nwhy 5 stars?  because everything went right.  was the service perfect? almost.  was the food perfect?  almost.  were the drinks perfect?  almost.  adding that all together with the right person i wanted to share the evening with, it was perfect.  (although i didn't ever finish my french laundry review, that place is nearly perfect with whoever you go with.  it is still to this day, the best eating experience i have ever had and i've had the fortune of going there 3 times now.)\n\nnow if i could only remember the name of the asst. sommelier, i would give him a shout out here.  \n\ni am once again a fan of emeril.  but please, no \"bam.\"", 
            "i have been to many steak places in vegas and had always wanted to go, but it can be hard to get a reservation. this time we planned way in advance so we could eat at a reasonable time. \n\nthe food: the food was reasonable but slightly over priced. the steak that i had was good and cooked to how i ordered it, but for $52.00, it could have been better. since it was served a la carte, i ordered a <mark>Baked Idaho Potato</mark>, $8.00.  i would suggest the pecan pie for dessert, best i have ever had.\n\nthe service: some of the best service i have every see before. everything was excellent from the moment our server arrived at our table to the moment we left. very professional but not to stuffy. all of his suggestions were right on.\n\ni am not sure i would go again, since there are so many places to choose from, but i would suggest it to my friends.", 
            "i went in with high expectations.  \nthe service was what i had expected, they were very attentive and were on top of our needs throughout our meal.  our waiters were great!  we sat down, water was brought over very quickly, as did the little \"wonton\" topped with kalamata olives and proscuitto thing.  i wasn't very impressed by it, i guzzled my water.  by the time i looked up again, my water had been refilled.  wow!  the waiter brought our bread and explained the menu.  then she let us be to ponder upon her words.  i chose the scallops with creamed corn sauce.  they scallops were cooked perfectly and the corn chower had lobster in it!  it was 7 minutes in heaven!  the mister and i both opted for steak.  he has the <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> and i had the bone-in ny strip.  we decided to share a twice <mark>Baked Idaho Potato</mark> with cheese and bacon.  his filet was just a filet.  my ny was huge!  if i had known it was going to be so large, i would have gotten a filet too.  i was only able to eat half of mine and was not able to have any potato.  the mister finished his steak and all the potato plus his bread which i didn't touch.  the steaks were cooked med-rare perfectly and seasoned.  i could have done without any seasoning on it but hey, that's how they came.  it wasn't ovewhemling in spices but enough that i didn't need any sauces besides the delicious butter just melting so erotically on the plate.  i was stuffed full of steak but i needed to satiate my sweet tooth.  we shared a pecan pie which came with a mound of ice cream.  the crust was absolutely fantastic and the pecans were not burnt.  we had no wine because we were just too dehydrated from the heat, water was all we needed.  i think the mister was slightly disappointed that his <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> wasn't as tender as the kobe steaks he is used to.  oh well!  i enjoyed my steak and i enjoyed being tended to like a princess.  i had a great night, it would have been better if the darn tables weren't' so close together.  i would have given it 5 stars, i just didn't like being able to hear what the people next to me were whispering about.  the prices were fairly reasonable for vegas, we've spent double at yamashiro's and redondo beach pier, plenty of times.\n\ndon't let the dress code fool you too much.  there were so many people in there wearing jeans and shorts, i felt a bit over dressed in a cocktail dress and he was wearing a dress shirt and slacks.  the restaurant looked semi-formal, the people there were looking mighty touristy so the ambiance was slightly off.", 
            "i am going to preface this review by saying that we were given free desserts and a special appetizer from the chef. this was due to my sister knowing the general manager as she was a vegas concierge for many years. that being said, i thought the meal experience was outstanding.\n\nwe were celebrating an anniversary and there were seven of us including a 7 year old. the waiter brought the aforementioned free appetizer, a steak and blue cheese  croquette and <mark>Pan Seared <mark>Foie Gras</mark></mark> with cherry compote. not bad. i started with the baby greens with fried mozzarella. the lettuce was decent, the mozzarella cold and disappointing. \n\ni asked a waiter, not ours, what she recommends and she said easily the rib eye in bone. it saved the meal. as juicy as any steak i've ever had, and spiced to perfection with a dollop of butter melting on top. my wife enjoyed the 2 pound lobster and had started with the <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> which she also devoured. the sides were ok. i had the twice <mark>Baked Idaho Potato</mark> with bacon and cheese, but also sampled the french fries, which they specially made for the 7 year old, and they were quite good.\n\ndessert, since it was free, was a virtual sampler platter. the pecan pie was excellent. the bread pudding was disapponting - i've never tried it with cubed up bread with sauce on top and not enough to reach the bottom and served with oreo ice cream and chocolate magic shell. i sampled three flavors of ice cream and gelato and disliked them all, they tasted like ice milk.\n\nthe service was impeccable. never a want. and the price was not bad, $325 for 7 people but if i included the freebies then it would have touched $400. bottom line is i'd go back if staying at the venetian but would try others if not.", 
            "boyfriend and i came here with two other friends as an early bday celebration!\n\nthe restaurant is right next to the passageway to the palazzo hotel and it sits right in front of the blue man theater. the ambience was nice except i took off a star for the boring cream colored walls. \n\nthe food was great! i had a <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> while the other three all had a bone in ribeye. ohmigosh...i couldn't believe how big these things were! they were ginormous! anyway, the sides were yummy! we had the <mark>Sauted Garlic Mushrooms</mark>, steamed asparagus, <mark>Baked Idaho Potato</mark>, <mark>Truffle and Parmesan Potato Chips</mark>, and spinach! geez...i know we couldn't even get to all of them!\n\ntheir famous banana cream pie was delicious! it was a little frozen...i prefer it to be a bit more thawed...but it was still good!\n\ntheir dinner rolls..ok...this is so filipino but damn..it tasted like hot pan-de-sal! it was so good! hahaha...seriously. emeril's gotta be stealing goldilock's or valerio's pandesal recipe! \n\n$400 for the 4 of us....it's alright...step outside and play roulette! make sure you put it all on red!", 
            "went there with co-workers because one of them had a craving for steak. we should've gone to just a whatever steakhouse that you could have for less than $20.\n\ntheir bone-in steak ran about $48. their appetizer salad special of the day (which i had as an entree) was $20. don't believe what the vegas tourist book says. it said it's \"$$\", where in actuality was more like \"$$$$\". i don't think i'd go there again. my friend said his <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> soup was just \"okay\" and not as good as another, less expensive place. he said it was bland and not much flavor to it. their twice-<mark>Baked Idaho Potato</mark> was pretty good, but i can imagine how unhealthy it is for you. \n\ntheir setting is nice though - dimly lit in some parts of the restaurant. great for couples or dates. and if you want to go there, make sure it's something special like a birthday or anniversary. that's probably the only time i'd go back if i ever went back.", 
            "it's been at least a year and half since i hit delmonico's - i wanted to try cut but the person that invited me and was flipping the bill, chose the bam guy's steakhouse and since i was free loadin' - all good with me.\n\nate around 6 - started with a fat tire ale, then a sauvignon blanc - both hit the spot after the heated drive. ordered the bone-in rib eye with blue cheese melted on top - medium ( i believe it costs $52 - i didn't have my reading glasses - difficult to read ! ) twice <mark>Baked Idaho Potato</mark>,( $9) asparagus ($8)  and the gumbo of the day ( $10)\n\namuse buche - some sort of mushroom tapanade on a crostini - not bad !\n\nthe gumbo - ok - kinda dull - expected more heat \n\nthe steak - shear perfection - and with the blue cheese bubblin' and slightly browned -  b -  u -  t  - fulllllll\n\nthe sides - all decent \n\nthe group shared banana cream pie and banana bread pudding - great !\n\nwe had 2 bottles of pinot noir - sonoma - could not read the name but it worked with the steak.\n\na meal like this is almost pushing me back into the rat race so i can enjoy the wining/dining i left behind when i retired.", 
            "i really like delmonico's.  i've dined here multiple times and have never been disappointed in either the service or the food.  we decided to have lunch here on our most recent vegas excursion.  my dad tried to get reservations for noon, but was told that they could seat us at 12:30pm instead.  no biggie.\n\nwhen we arrived, there were only about two other tables occupied.  not sure why we couldn't come in at noon, but whatever.  we ordered the <mark>Truffle and Parmesan Potato Chips</mark> with truffle oil and parmesan as our app.  i never thought of <mark>Truffle and Parmesan Potato Chips</mark> as a gourmet dish, but now i know better.  excellent!\n\nmy sister and i split the salmon which had a bbq-esque sauce and was served with onion strings.  the waiter actually asked how we would like to have our salmon prepared.  i've never had a waiter ask that before.  pretty cool.  we also shared a side of broccoli (gotta eat your veggies) and the twice <mark>Baked Idaho Potato</mark> with white cheddar and bacon (omg!).  so yummy!\n\nfor dessert we all split two of the infamous banana cream pies.  can you say holy banana goodness?  another omg moment!  in all honesty, that pie is one of the main reasons we went to delmonico's.  ;)\n\ni would highly recommend dining at delmonico's if you are in the neighborhood.  be prepared for a leisurely meal (service can be slow, but it is relaxing) and some delicious food.  bon appetit!", 
            "this is not my first time at delmonico. i was in vegas a few years ago on business (again) and had a group dinner (10-12 people) here. i did not make the reservation but the person who did somehow got us the chef's table. if you are not familar...the chef's table is it's own room separate but right next to the kitchen. because the room is made up of clear glass...we could see right into the kitchen and watch our meals being made. it was very cool. we did the tasting menu. it was all great and the portions were so large that by round 4 i was uncomfortably full...and still had the steak course to go! \n\ni came back for dinner last week with some friends for dinner. no chef's table this time...sat in the regular ole dining area. service was pretty good and i thought the food delivered (although my initial experience was a bit more memorable). we had the calamari with an live tapenade and also the bbq shrimp. i thought the calamari was good, not spectacular (this would not have been my first choice as an app but i wasn't the only one at dinner). i thought the bbq shrimp was delicious and had great flavor, cooked perfectly. split a blue cheese wedge - can't go wrong there. i had the mixed grill special which came with a piece of pork tenderloin, slab of bacon & a piece of andouille sausage all served over greens and andouille grits. delicous! the andouille sausage was the star of the plate as far as i'm concerned. my friend had a ribeye and a cheddar twice <mark>Baked Idaho Potato</mark> and enjoyed it. someone else got the pork tenderloin off the regular menu which came with grits, greens & cornbread pancakes (which were tasty). all of us enjoyed our meals. i think it's a nice little \"splurge\" for dinner. \n\ni do agree with another reviewer who said that the ambience is nothign special (unless you get the chef's table of course) and that the steak selection was nothing different - same cuts of meat as other fine steak houses. i didn't see that \"wow\" factor onthe menu...which is why i ordered one of the specials.", 
            "delmonico's is easily a 5-star restaurant, but not because there is a famous name (emeril lagasse) associated with the restaurant -- but because the food is simply exceptional. this is fine dining without the pretentiousness of stuffy, overpriced, mini-portion restaurants. \n\nwe happened to be staying at the venetian hotel & casino and made reservations to delmonico's, which is on the premises. there was about a 1-minute wait and we were quickly whisked away to a candlelit table. the restaurant itself is very simple yet elegant; nothing over the top, flashy or obnoxious. the lighting is perfect; not too dark and the wait staff is extremely attentive and prompt.\n\ndelmonico's is known for their steak; the bone-in rib eye steak. this slab of meat is prime and comes with a nice price tag. if you're at delmonico's -- ya might as well go for it, chump!\n\nfor starters, i had the <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> soup; thick, creamy and packed with flavor. i absolutely loved it! best <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> i have ever had. it came adorned with a polenta type cake in the middle. i am not sure if it was polenta or dried shrimp cake -  or even bread, but it didn't matter as it all happily made its way down my belly. \n\nwe also tried the crab meat cake; fresh chunks of crab atop a puff pastry and dressed with tomatoes, lima beans, asparagus and all sorts of good spring veggies. amazing! \n\ni decided to try the <mark>Colorado Rack of Lamb</mark> with the twice <mark>Baked Idaho Potato</mark>. jeff went with the rib eye steak and <mark>Baked Idaho Potato</mark>. the lamb was head-spinning! topped with a rich sauce and truffles! perfectly cooked and moist and tender and gaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhh! i can't rave enough. the steak was just as good -- even the fatty pieces were delicious. \n\nthe food, the service, the atmosphere, the attention to detail, the $25 corking fee -- all was worth the price. definitely a place to experience while out in sin city!", 
            "while at vegas, our friends out of the blue, wanted to go eat at a nice restaurant for dinner since it was fight night and all the clubs would have a long line. they made the reservations around 4pm for a 9:30pm dinner, so making reservations last minute isn't a problem.\n\nthough we arrived on time, we had to wait at least 15 minutes to get seated, so we just waited at the bar. i thought the bar area looked better than the actual dining area itself. it was modern and sleek, with a piano situated at the far side of the room.\n\nour hostess took us into the dining area, where we were immediately greeted by our smiling waitress. very attentive, nice, and down to earth, explained the specials and menu to us. meanwhile, the busboys/girls gave us hot bread, which my filipino friends said tasted like filipino bread. it was topped with finely grated cheese and salt, and they loved it. our waters were constantly refilled before it was even half empty.\n\nwe all ordered either the rib-eye off the bone ($42), or the bone in rib-eye ($46). 14 to 16 oz. for the rib-eye. i tried both the steaks and they tasted the same to me. it was dry-aged 14 days, which you could tell when you sliced the meat with your knife. tender, flavorful, delicious! i loved that the sides were encrusted with pepper and salt. my other friend ordered the filet-mignon, which she could not finish. i loved how it melted in your mouth and it was also very flavorful. we got the <mark>Country Smashed Potatoes</mark>, the <mark>Baked Idaho Potato</mark>, and the <mark>Roasted Fingerling Potatoes</mark>. the <mark>Roasted Fingerling Potatoes</mark> tasted the best. i thought it was perfect the way it was salted. the other 2 potatoes didn't stand out to me. \n\ndecor was minimal and sort of disappointing. the bathrooms were kind of disgusting to me because it seemed as if they didn't clean it much. the meal was delicious, but i still love mastro's more! \n\nat the end of our meal, one of the waiters kept coming by our table asking us if we needed help with our bill (because we had a party of 9). he came five times. it was super annoying and it seemed that he was afraid we'd dine and run or something just because it was taking awhile for us to figure out how to calculate tax and tip and collecting money from people.\n\ni'd definitely come here again, but after i try other steakhouses in vegas!", 
            "my experience at delmonico steakhouse was well-above average, but not as fantastic as i thought it would be.  first off, although we had made reservations well in advance, we had to wait over 20 minutes for our table.  all was not completely lost, however, since we passed the time in delmonico's classy little, modish bar area where we got started on our red wine for the evening. \n\nthere was a bit of confusion amongst the servers shortly after we were seated, and we experienced a delay in receiving our selection of bottled waters for our table.  at delmonico, they give you the option of choosing from a few types of bottled and mineral waters for an additional charge, or you can request just regular,complimentary tap water. after the initial delay, our water glasses were refilled continuously throughout the meal, however. \n\nlike most five star restaurants, at delmonico steakhouse, you receive service from several members of the waitstaff, which ensures constant attention and most of your dining needs are met without even having to request anything.\n\nthe interior of the steakhouse was minimalist, with tables covered in cream colored linens and simple, modern brown leather chairs for seating. the space had a slightly mediterranean feel due to its coved ceilings.  no doubt because the restaurant is located inside the venetian hotel, they wanted to maintain a slightly italian theme througout. \n\nthe restaurant, which was was packed with patrons, was also very loud.  i think the coved ceilings were extremely conducive to the noise level contained in the dining room.  this combined with brighter than desired lighting, created a slightly less intimate dining experience than were were anticipating.  \n\nthe food was very good, however.  we started with the crabcake, and it was tender, buttery and delicious.  followed by that, were our iceberg wedge salads with bacon, blue cheese and all the yummies.  hubby ordered the <mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark>, and i ordered the bone-in ny strip, both were cooked to medium perfection.  for sides, we shared a huge, delicious <mark>Baked Idaho Potato</mark> with sour cream, bacon, green onions and cheddar. for dessert, we shared the caramel creme brulee, and it was very, very good.\n\noverall, we enjoyed our meal very much, and we would return here again for the food.  our experience was just was not over-the-top fabulous because of the noise and lighting factors.", 
            "he may be a tv celebrity chef, but you can't take away credit where credit is due: emeril is a fantastic restaurateur.  my wife and i have dined here twice; the first time because we were staying at the venetian and the second time we purposely came back to eat here on one of our anniversaries while staying in vegas.  in short this is a fantastic formal steakhouse experience all around.  what sold us was the chateaubriand for two. expertly cooked and finished off by table side with a flame of cognac for that over-the-top vegas style experience.  quite possibly one of the most memorable steaks we've had in our life. tender with an explosion of flavor when you take a bite, mmm.  there are several wonderful side dishes you can choose to complement the meat and so far we haven't been disappointed in any of them whether you go for the vegetable of the day (garlic pan fried green beans the last time were there) or the bacon and cheddar grits, mashed potatoes, or <mark>Baked Idaho Potato</mark>. oh and for your prerequisite greenery before the meat course they also do a fantastic <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> prepared at table side for 2 as well.  desert? yes please!  you can't go wrong with their caramel cream brulee but everything on their dessert menu looked sweetly decadent.  i don't think i need bother describing the wine or drink menu here other than this is vegas after all and if you possibly couldn't find what you're after here to complement your meal then i'm sure they could get it for you.", 
            "loved it! went to delmonico steakhouse a few days ago with a group of friends, and absolutley loved the food and the service. \n\nthe service:  the service was impeccable.  i've seen better (well only one other place could beat their service) but delmonico put ruth's chris and mortons to shame. yes, i said it... to shame.  that's how great they are. drank one inch of water, and was immediately refilled with another inch.  drank one inch of wine, and was immediately refilled.  food was brought on very reasonable time.  though if i could complain, i would've wanted the staff to be a little more friendlier.  felt they were being a little less friendly because of our age.  but i'll let it slide.\n\nthe food: i can complain nothing about the food! the food was fantastic.  the best steak i've ever ate, hands down! was worth every penny (or should i say dollar).  even the <mark>Baked Idaho Potato</mark> was super good (and it's just a regular <mark>Baked Idaho Potato</mark>!) its as good as it gets.\n\ni would highly recommend this place for a business meeting or a date.  it's just a wonderful eating experience.  would definitely come back again, emeril did not disappoint!", 
            "my hubby and i had date night here before seeing zumanity- this was one of the best steaks i have ever had. we are from texas, so we know good steak. i got mine crusted with blue cheese. we had the <mark>Sauted Garlic Mushrooms</mark> and 2x <mark>Baked Idaho Potato</mark>. the atmosphere is great and the dessert was amazng. we had the banana cream pie. to die for!!! we booked online!!!", 
            "people looking for a steak fix should definitely head over here for a yummy steak. the salad was a absolutely delicious. the mushrooms melted in my mouth and were just so good.\nmy wife and i both had soup as an appetizer, something this place is very well known for. i had the shrimp gumbo, now that was great gumbo. my wife had the fillet minion and i tried the cajun steak which was just so tender and juicy, talk about perfection here.\nwe also had the asparagus, how perfectly cooked.\ni decided to have a yummy <mark>Baked Idaho Potato</mark> with my dinner,  butter and sour cream right along with it. delmonico is by far the best steakhouse i have ever been to in las vegas.\nthe waiter  was very friendly and very knowledgeable of the menu. the owner is the great emeril lagasse, the guy that yells bam!!!! on his cooking show. come here if you want the best steak ever.", 
            "this was my first trip to vegas...ever.  i know, how can that be after 31 years of age and my love for everything naughty?  nevertheless, i wanted to have one memorable, fantastic dinner while there.  after consulting with a few friends and reading fellow yelpers reviews we decided on delmonico steakhouse at the venetian.\n\nfirst, i was able to make our reservation online about two months in advance (same time i booked the trip).  it was so easy i would definitely recommend it to ensure you will have a table ready and waiting for you.  second, because mr. vivi and i were killing it at the blackjack table at the mandalay...we were about 15 minutes late for our reservation.  i apologized numerous times when we arrived, and to my relief our table was still ours and the host was super friendly and understanding.  note:  i don't know if this would fly on a busy fri or sat night.\n\nto say the service was excellent could be an understatement.  we had our main server, i think his name was eric (insert free drinks at the aforementioned blackjack table so his name could have been bob) and he couldn't be more helpful, polite and efficient.  we also had two other people who were assisting eric with the service who were great as well.  eric helped me pick out a glass of red wine that was delicious and didn't make me feel bad for not being the wine connoisseur everyone and their mom thinks they are.  our drinks were brought to us very quickly and we were off to the food.  \n\ni had been perusing the menu for awhile and thought we would go with a full four course meal however, i had no idea how fun the tables would be and didn't want too much food to deter my winnings after dinner.  we opted to skip the appetizer (would have loved to have try the crab cakes or at least the <mark>Truffle and Parmesan Potato Chips</mark>) and went straight to the cesar salad served table side for two.  if you love cesar salad please do me a favor and run to this place.  they freaking make the entire thing in front of you, dressing included.  when eric was finished with my plate i could have clapped i was so happy...in fact i think i did. \n\nnext, we went for the petite medallions with a side of asparagus and a twice <mark>Baked Idaho Potato</mark>.  can i say i am in heaven??  this is why i could never be a vegetarian.  the meat was cooked to absolute perfection.  so tender it felt like butter in my mouth.  the asparagus and twice <mark>Baked Idaho Potato</mark> were both good, but i would definitely try something different next time...there is just too much to chose from.  \n\ni knew in advance the bill was going to be somewhat expensive but seriously, it was worth every single penny.  from start to finish the entire experience made me forget i left a table we were up 500 dollars.  \"ah yeah babe,\" this place is that good and i will be back the next time i visit.", 
            "this is my 3rd visit to delmonico and unfortunately i have to lowered my rating.\n\nthis is mainly for the service. you would imagine a fine dining establishment like delmonico would give you top notch service when you're there, it was average at best.\n\ni ordered a glass of wine, the bone in rib eye, the bone in new york, cream of corn, and a twice <mark>Baked Idaho Potato</mark>. the server kept insisting we add an appetizer and a half bottle of wine to our order. i know its their job to encourage customers to order more, but i had a sense the server felt like i wasn't spending enough to justify exceptional service.\n\nthis may be a pet-peeve of mine, but i hate it when the server doesn't bring you the bill nor does he bring you back the bill after you paid. the runner did this. the runner also was the one who asked if i would like dessert. i know its a busy restaurant, but the server could have brought back the bill and asked if i enjoyed everything (what if something was wrong?). again this is a pet-peeve of mine.\n\nratings for the food:\n\nbone in rib eye: 5/5 stars\nbone in new york: 4/5 stars\ncream of corn: 5 stars\ntwice <mark>Baked Idaho Potato</mark>: 4/5 stars\nregular <mark>Baked Idaho Potato</mark> (from a previous stay): 3/5 stars\ncalamari (from a previous stay): 3/5 stars\ndinner rolls: 5/5 stars", 
            "delmonico steakhouse was pretty good, but definitely not the best i've had nor without flaws.\n\nthe food and drink choices seem to be where they really excel, as there were a number of options that my girlfriend and i found to be mouth-watering, from the <mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark>, the fillet, the chicken, salmon, etc.  they had my favorite beer (chimay blue) and she enjoyed her wine (she had the chardonnay and riesling).  what we wanted when going here was a nice, fancy dinner as a tribute to our vacation together.  it wasn't a special occasion or anything but we like to have a quality dinner from time to time.  i'd say the food part of emeril's more or less did the trick with regards to that.\n\nthe service was ok.  while they were relatively prompt the matre'd was the person who seemed to be serving us and he was just a little too over-the-top for me, not to mention he seemed a little condescending and careless.  perhaps i just read into it wrong, but i didn't feel as comfortable as i have at other restaurants.  our waiters made sure the waters and bread kept coming, which i appreciated.  the matre'd didn't really do anything rude per-say, but i did notice that at one point when he came by to check on everything he spoke with the tables on our left and right but not with us.  \n\nthe smaller tables are a little too big imo, my girlfriend and i felt a mile away from each other and eventually i just moved my place settings next to her and sat with her so we could talk easier.  this is probably not an issue if you have a big group, but for a romantic evening it wasn't fantastic.  speaking of romance, there were no candles, the lightning was bright, and the restaurant was devoid of decor. \n\ni don't mean to rip delmonico's so much but i just want to stress that this restaurant really doesn't deserve 5 stars despite the food being pretty tasty.  our stakes came out medium rare as requested, they were juicy and delicious, and the side \"double-<mark>Baked Idaho Potato</mark>\" + \"asparagus\" was fantastic.\n\ni realized going here and glancing at the menu online that the prices were going to be steep but i guess my wallet received a shock even so.  i had initially been hoping that our bill would come to about $115-130, but in the end it was $200 because you have to buy sides for your meal separately and the wine / beer was very expensive.  the problem with this is that in vegas there is a lot of competition and i've had food that was on par with this for under half the price of what i paid.  for instance mon ami gabi (outside of paris, paris) and trevi (ceasar's palace forum shops) both run in the $60-100 range (for two) and are just as tasty imo.\n\nlastly, there were a nat or two flying around toward the end of our meal, something which is unacceptable in a restaurant of this caliber.  \n\ni enjoyed the overall experience but i would not dine here again.", 
            "just okay.  \n\ni liked my meal.  i had the gumbo soup, a great <mark>Baked Idaho Potato</mark> with lots of fixings, a sort of chocolate cheesecake dessert that was great.  my husband didn't like his meal.  my husband ordered a $50 steak that was fatty and gristley.  i could tell he was bummed when he poked around at his steak with furrowed eyebrows, cutting off piece after piece of inedible meat.\n\n  i was really hoping to please him since it was his birthday.  i let them know when i made the reservations well in advance that it was his birthday and we didn't get a birthday dessert or anything free like you do at most other restaurants.  they remembered it was his birthday, the hostess (who was pleasant and very friendly) gave him a cheery happy birthday as we were going to be seated.  i really expect a little something special if we are spending our special day at their establishment.\n\n  the waitstaff was prompt and friendly.  they seemed to linger around and dive right in when you need a refill on your drink, or in my case another great martini.  i almost forgot to mention that i loved their martinis.  \n\nwill we return?  definitely no.  there are way more better restaurants in vegas.  the atmosphere is a big blah (with the exception of the impressive suits that the friendly waitors wear), the food was just okay/slightly better than average, and the prices higher than they should be for the quality.", 
            "we went in with high hopes after a friend recommended delmonico but we left just a bit disappointed.  the ambiance was really nice and we were given a great table without a reservation but the food left a little to be desired.  \n\nmy friend and i both started with <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark>, which was good but a little thin.  we noticed right away too that she had 2 tiny little pieces of lobster in hers, but i had almost an entire small claw.  i was happy until i realized it was tough and rubbery.  i actually had to use a knife and fork to cut it into bite sized pieces.  my husband ordered the wedge salad as a starter and it was 80% white/yellow core.  not what you would expect in a place as pricey as this.\n\ni ordered the fillet and it was cooked perfectly but it was not a great cut of meat.  maybe i have high standards, but i think a $30+ fillet should be butter knife soft, but this one was kind of fibrous and hard to cut with a steak knife.  i didn't really care for the seasoning either, but that's a personal preference, not something i can count against the restaurant.  my husband's rib eye was really fatty but he loved his twice <mark>Baked Idaho Potato</mark>.  i had the corn gratin for my side and it was tasty but again, not my style.  \n\nour server was efficient but pretty standoffish.  when we first sat down, we ordered a bottle of \"emerel's blend\" wine and he nicely suggested that we might want to try something else, but other than that, his interaction with us was a bit cold.  \n\nmaybe it was an off night, but i really expected more from a $400+ dinner.", 
            "favorite steakhouse in las vegas. conveniently located in the venetian and servers are very attentive. classy, noise level wasn't too high, they even help the ladies with their chair when they sit. big list of wine choices and they have huge cuts of rib-eye. full bar you can order drinks from when you first enter the restaurant.\n\nmy first time i came with 2 other friends, i believe i ordered the <mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark>, which is unbelievably huge. it was literally bigger than my face. i got my ribeye in medium rare, and came out to be just right. lots of butter, and we also ordered a couple sides. picked out a bottle of wine which was the perfect topping to our fatty peices of steak.\n\nthey also serve dinner rolls! warm and soft, and lots of butter =]\n\ni came back in recent march and ordered a smaller cut, also in medium rare but it wasn't as good as my first time here. ate here with one other person, he ordered <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> which was very tender. we each ordered a glass of wine, although i'd rather choose a bottle instead next time as there are more choices of wine. also had the <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark>, which i absolutely love, so creamy but it was a little thin. not too many pieces of lobster meat either. ordered one side, a <mark>Baked Idaho Potato</mark> which was a little on the dry side.\n\nthere was a small fly that kept flying around us during dinner... it ended up in my water...\n\nhad creme brulee for dessert, they also serve homemade madeleine cookies with the creme brulee, both were very good.",

            "too many places to eat in vegas! but, im not the type of girl who can ever turn down steak, so off to delmonico's it was\n\nwhat i ate:\n- heirloom tomato and burrata salad: caprese salad, all grown up! the heirloom tomatoes were delicious, juicy, and flavorful. the burrata cheese, gooey, creamy, the perfect delicate match to the tomatoes. the syrupy sharp balsamic vinegar reduction made everything go pop with flavor. my only gripe was that i wish there was more basil to bring in the fresh flavor. regardless, this was pretty damn good\n- [special of the day] beef medallions with mushrooms and parm: the beef had a nice bite to it, the mushrooms and sauce were to die for, but i wondered if i should have just opted for a nice steak\n- <mark>Baked Idaho Potato</mark> w/everything on it [side]: cheesy perfection\n- haricots verts [side]: perfectly cooked string beans with garlic and almonds\n- mushrooms [side]: a nice mix of mushrooms, this would make any mushroom lover happy\n- banana cream pie: i love banana cream pie, but lets be honest, all banana cream pies pretty much taste the same, right? wrong! this banana cream pie was perfectly layered. oh man, i could have eaten this entire thing all by myself, but sharing is caring!\n- coffee: coffee lovers beware! the coffee is so good (french pressed) that im tempted to just come back for a slice of the banana cream pie and coffee next time im in town!\n\npros:\n- food: food was perfect. everything was delicious\n- service: friendly, polite, helpful. our server helped me pick out a great wine in the price point i wanted\n- free bruschetta starter. when i called to make the rez i let them know it was for a birthday\n- free banana sorbet for the birthday girl\n- bathrooms were clean and well stocked! my stall even had a lil basket of tampons. how thoughtful! ;)\n\ncons:\n- good food and good service comes with a price... but, to be honest, considering how much we ate, and having a bottle of wine, it was not any more expensive than i thought it would be. our entire meal, plus tax and tip came out about $500, which is very reasonable cause it was for five girls... it also helped that i won a few bills gambling earlier that day :p\n- reservations: i was able to get a rez for a late dinner, which is what i wanted anyways, but if youre planning on being in vegas, it would be smart to call to make a rez ahead of time if you like eating your dinner at the regular dinner time\n- loud: im not sure if its due to the dome shaped ceilings, but voices carried. i guess you have to expect that though from a steak house - full of dates and guys\n\nwould i come again? if i won some extra cash gambling and craving steak, yes!", 
            "this is my favorite restaurant in the united states, bar none.\n\nsome of the best service and atmosphere i've ever seen in a restaurant, anywhere. for example....\n\na few days before one visit, i called to request that the peanut butter cream pie, a dessert special from a past trip, be once again on the desert menu. when we showed up for dinner, we didn't see the pie on the menu, but were informed that the chef had made and saved an entire pie just for our party. it was unbelievable.\n\nand oh the food....\n\n** warning: this meal is a marathon. if you're not a big eater, don't be afraid to share appetizers, order smaller steaks, skip the rolls, etc so that you can room for all parts of this amazing, amazing meal.\n\n**** appetizers ****\n-- <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> is the clear ungodly standout.\n-- all the salads are routinely excellent.\n-- skip the <mark><mark>Ahi Tuna</mark> and Salmon Tartare</mark> and <mark>Heirloom Tomato Soup</mark> -- they aren't as impressive.\n-- the free rolls are really, really excellent.\n\n**** wine ****\n-- for those that (like me) enjoy wine but aren't connoisseurs, the fisticuffs cabernet is my go-to. it goes great with all steaks at a reasonable ($55) price.\n\n**** steak ****\n-- ribeye is the obvious play, and is amazing (and huge), but the filet is outstanding for those who want something smaller and not quite as rich.\n-- try <mark>Au Poivre Style</mark> for really powerful flavor. steak purists should do the ribeye straight up, but those who like peppery and lightly sweet flavors would love the filet au poivre.\n-- i am told that they serve entrees besides steak, but i have never, ever seen anyone be so misguided as to come here and fail to order a steak.\n\n**** sides ****\n-- usually we have one person order all the sides for the group, just to make sure we get a good mix of them so everyone can try everything. they're served family-style, and are big enough for ~3 people to have some.\n-- twice <mark>Baked Idaho Potato</mark> (which has gratuitous amounts of cheese and bacon) is incredible, albeit heavy. two can share, but my friends insist on ordering their own.\n-- mushrooms are some of the best i've had, and go perfectly with the steak.\n-- broccoli or asparagus is a good choice to contrast the rich steak.\n\n**** desserts ****\n-- oatmeal pecan pie is one of my favorite desserts anywhere. you will want a whole one yourself after one bite, so order accordingly.\n-- banana cream pie is well known and hyped, for good reason. it is also enormous.\n-- skip the bread pudding and peach cobblers -- they're good but not in the same league.", 
            "i like this restaurant. one of emril legasses' offerings.\nit does seem a bit pretentious to those uninitiated, but clearly when you are approached by the wait staff, its everything but. they are well informed and can  give you the advice you need when ordering, are courteous and explanatory.\nthe service is awesome and i think the food is very good. the steaks (rib eye, porterhouse, filet) are done to perfection, they are char-grilled with butter, making them an even greater artery hardener than they already are, but they are delicious.  if you like a steak, this is the place to go in vegas. in my estimation, it is better than prime at bellagio and sw at wynn. the menu is pricey 50-60 bucks for a filet, and then all your sides are extra (6-8 bucks for a <mark>Baked Idaho Potato</mark>), but its well worth it, if you like a steak. as well, the salads (caesar is signature) are terrific, as well as the vegetable and fungi selection in terms of potatoes, asparagus, and sides of mushrooms. the desserts are also very good, the bread pudding is one to watch. excellent.\nfor two people and a nice bottle of wine, one is looking at about $350-$400, or more.\nhighly recommended before some of the other steakhouses in vegas. take a beautiful lady and she'll be suitably impressed if she is a meat eater.", 
            "went to vegas with the husband to celebrate our 10 year anniversary and take that honeymoon that had been postponed for far too long.  one of the reasons we booked at the venetian was to dine at delmonico steakhouse.\n\nwe originally made a reservation for lunch on sunday but moved it to dinner as the husband was worried lunch service didn't offer all the varieties of steak.  made the mistake of booking for 9 pm on monday, august 20th.  the hotel was packed with a new rush of guests as was the restaurant.\n\nenjoyed a drink in the bar before being seated and were then led to a small table where we were introduced to josh, our primary server.  josh informed us that we would have 3 servers that evening one of which would be a sommelier.  \n\nwe perused the wine list and then lamont came over and asked \"if anyone had explained the menu\" to us - a jarring question in a fine dining establishment.  we decided to start with wine by the glass as we didn't want a full bottle at that point.  i asked lamont about a blend on the list -- i inquired as to what was in the blend.  he asked me what i meant.  i clarified by saying what types of wines are used to make the blend.  he rattled off one variety and then said \"and i think a cabernet is in there\".  lamont made no offer to explain or recommend any other wines.  we ordered two glasses of malbec, our appetizer and entrees.  my husband asked lamont if he could get a side of garlic butter.  lamont said no - they don't have garlic butter.  really?!  this is an emeril lagasse restaurant!  he asked for a side of plain butter and we sent lamont on his way.  \n\na food runner, or possibly our third server (he never introduced himself), delivered a complimentary appetizer of tuna atop a crostini which i enjoyed but the husband did not.\n\njosh came back with our wines.  we inquired as to whether lamont was the sommelier that josh had mentioned earlier and he affirmed that he was.  we expressed our surprise and disbelief yet josh did not follow up with any inquiry as to why we asked the question.  at this point i had to talk my husband out of storming out of the restaurant.  josh did not alert the floor manager of our question or our discontent.  it is unclear if this was because of poor training or due to the staff not being able to handle when the restaurant is full.\n\nour salad with arugula, granny smith apples, prosciutto and champagne vinaigrette arrived and was very tasty.  we started to move past the negativity and then waited and waited for our entrees.  the husband ordered another glass of malbec and asked for more bread, which never came.  the steaks were quite good but the extra butter was not delivered.  the twice <mark>Baked Idaho Potato</mark> was yummy and the side of mushrooms was divine.  \n\nthe espresso creme brulee and pecan pie desserts were very good and we appreciated the complimentary banana gelato with 'happy anniversary\" written in chocolate on the plate but it still wasn't enough to make up for the fact that our servers' poor performance ruined an experience we looked forward to for months.  i would have given delmonico steakhouse one star due to the service but gave it two because of the food.  we expected much more.  i suggest you go somewhere else.\n\nfyi - delmonico steakhouse is a large restaurant that seats approximately 100 patrons.  the women's restroom has 2 stalls.", 
            "my mom lives in vegas so i am there all the time and we try a lot of the nicer restaurants in town.  delmonico steakhouse was one of the better ones.  we were a little early for our reservation so we sat in the bar and ordered a few drinks.  the hostess then called our name after only a couple of minutes so we did not get our drinks in the bar but they brought them to the table and added them to our bill.  it was a very smooth process.  for dinner, i had the fillet mignon with blue cheese melted on it.  it was delicious.  the steak was a tad undercooked for my taste but i did order medium rare.  i guess i was expecting the norm where other restaurants cook medium rare closer to medium.  but overall the steak was delicious.  good flavor and i loved the blue cheese.  my mom had the <mark>Colorado Rack of Lamb</mark>.  again a little too undercooked for her taste but they truly cooked it to medium rare.  we shared the twice <mark>Baked Idaho Potato</mark> with cheese and bacon.  yummy!  the bread was good too.  we had a great main waiter and his assistants.  everyone treated us well and in a timely manner.  definitely a place i will go again.", 
            "i'd probably give delmonico four stars, except that my expectations were set higher than they probably should have been. in all honesty, the delmonico did not deliver anything notably better, more worthy of celebrity, than the average high end steak house in nashville - including stoney river, ruth's, or local favorites like sperry's. i guess i thought that for all the critique emeril gives top chef stars, his restaurant would blow me away.\n\nthe homemade <mark>Truffle and Parmesan Potato Chips</mark> were good, and somewhat unique, but perhaps a little over cooked, leaving a numb of chips hard.\n\nour steaks were indeed prepared excellently, and a quality cut of meat. i had the filet, which was an ample serving and cooked to a perfect medium rare.\n\nbut the twice <mark>Baked Idaho Potato</mark> were a big disappointment. <mark>Half Dozen Raw Oysters on the Half Shell</mark> seems to be way overcooked, to the point or requiring a steak knife to cut through them. the flavor was bland, even with cheddar and bacon. a little salt and pepper certainly helped.\n\nwe did enjoy the <mark>Delmonico Creamed Spinach</mark>, even including my colleague who usually doesn't like green things.\n\nthe bread pudding was definitely the way to go on dessert. we also had a slice of banana cream pie, but the star was the bread pudding, which was not ruined with raisins. it was rich, smooth, creamy and delicious.", 
            "i am a sucker for celebrity chef restaurants. after a poor dining experience at gordon ramsey's pub & grill, i was a little skeptical to try another one. delmonico was wonderful and would blow the pants off anything with gordon ramsey's name attached.\n\nthe service here was impeccable. we had multiple servers and they all worked as a team. we never had to ask for anything because they were always on top of it.\n\nthe wine list was like a novel! \n\ni ordered the <mark>Vine-Ripened Heirloom Tomato Salad</mark> with burrata, which was very tasty. for my meal, i had the <mark>Filet Mignon</mark>, cooked perfectly medium rare. overcooked meat does not make me happy, so i was very pleased with how mine came out. i also ordered a <mark>Baked Idaho Potato</mark> with the works...this potato was huge. the waitress even offered to being me more toppings if i ran out.\n\nfor dessert, we tried the banana bread pudding which was delicious and very rich with a scoop of ice cream on top.\n\ni was extremely impressed with delmonico and would absolutely eat there again!", 
            "i have had the best meal of my life, on 3 separate occasions at emeril lagasse's delmonicos.  i loved how i have never been let down when i have gone there.  i really enjoy steak, and his <mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark> was the best i have ever had - the crust on the medium-rare perfection was amazing.  \n\nthat being said, i expect a great steak at any steakhouse i go to, so that's not enough to make this my best meal ever.  however, the sides and dessert we equally amazing! the <mark>Delmonico Creamed Spinach</mark> is unlike any other i've ever had, the mushroom were succulent, and the football sized <mark>Baked Idaho Potato</mark> really hit the spot.  the service was great, the ambiance is perfect, and the chairs and tables are very comfortable.\n\ni wish i could come here more often.  every time i plan a vegas trip, the sure bet is that i will be here.  i loved it, and i think you would too.", 
            "delicious- from the cocktails to the steaks! apps: we tried the oysters and bbq shrimp (holy yum!). entrees: our party of 6 had all steaks (filet, ribeye and <mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark>) which were all cooked to perfection. one ribeye was very fatty but that's to be expected with that cut and the portion size of the steaks is so that there was plenty to be found that was free of fat- seriously, these steaks are huge, definitely share-worthy. sides: creamed corn (very yum!), sauteed mushrooms (yum), mashed potatoes (how can you go wrong) and a twice <mark>Baked Idaho Potato</mark> (a little over done on the bottom but still good regardless). we enjoyed the service and the experience overall. would highly recommend!", 
            "steak! my first trip to vegas was this past summer with a group of friends. we ate here one night and it's the best steak i have every had in my life. i started with the <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> and for dinner had the boneless ribeye medium rare with a bunch of different sides for the table, no room for desert though. also two of my friends ordered the <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> which they make table side (for two people).  \n\n<mark>Lobster Bisque</mark>... very very tasty and rich. if you don't like rich foods then you should not order this. it also has nice size chunks of lobster in it. \n\nboneless ribeye, medium rare...amazing. it was cooked to perfection, just the way medium rare should be. it was well cooked and well seasoned, there's no need to dip it in ketchup or steak sauce. it was a pretty decent size cut of meat too, i can't remember the ounces but i left stuffed. \n\n<mark>Caesar Salad</mark>...i'm not a fan of rabbit food but watching the person make it table side it looked really good. in a matter of about 5-8 minutes he made two servings of what i was told was the best <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> ever,\n\nat this restaurant, the steak doesn't come with anything, you have to order the sides separately, i think we ordered asparagus, wild sauteed wild mushrooms and twice <mark>Baked Idaho Potato</mark>. all was cooked to perfection. \n\nthe service...it was the outstanding. there are three people per table, so you are always attended to and the waiter is well versed in the menu and the drinks. i wasn't too sure what i wanted so i asked him for a recommendation and he asked me a few questions and based on those answers brought a drink out, which was good. i can't remember the name but it was good. i think it had 3 different kinds of liquor in it but it didn't taste like it at all, not overwhelming, good blend, good bartender. \n\nit is expensive but well worth the money. the food, the service, the atmosphere and best of all since it is vegas no need to really dress up, my kind of place. definitely have to go there again when i go back during christmas.", 
            "quite possibly, the best steak i ever had.  went here with my wife and made sure i had reservations.  we were seated promptly upon arrival.  the rolls were delicious, as they are in all of emeril's restaurants.  ordered the <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> soup, which was incredible.  the large pieces of lobster inside the soup just made it all that much better.  i ordered the <mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark> and my wife ordered the filet.  both steaks were cooked perfectly and were extremely tender.  we also enjoyed the twice <mark>Baked Idaho Potato</mark> with our meal.  for dessert, we had to have the banana cream pie.  it was absolutely fabulous.  it had chocolate shavings drizzled on top and caramel sauce on the plate.  this is not your ordinary piece of pie.  it was absolutely heaven.  we had a fantastic meal, just like we have at emeril's other restaurants.  the service was excellent and the staff was very friendly.", 
            "i have eaten at this restaurant twice. the first meal was memorable and i never forgot it. as a result, i was so excited to go back last week. i had the <mark>Truffle and Parmesan Potato Chips</mark> for an appetizer which were good but they didn't fit in with that kind of restaurant. my friend had a shrimp appetizer that was the favorite of the waiter's but we both found it very strange. it was supposed to be something creole and the shrimp was covered with an unattractive brown sauce. odd.\n\nwe both had a <mark>Filet Mignon</mark>. i ordered mine medium rare. i couldn't finish the last 15% of it because it was rare. disgusting. it was fine but not worth $50. it came with a  sauce that made it delicious though. without the sauce it would have been a big disappointment.\n\nwe ordered a side of double <mark>Baked Idaho Potato</mark>. that was the best part of the meal.\n\nwe each ordered a dessert. i had the banana cream pie. it was gorgeous but it was all bananas (which i love) but with little cream. it was fine. my friend had the creme brulee and it was delicious.\n\nservice was very nice. overall at $312 i won't be going back simply because it isn't worth the money.",

            "my husband and i ate here for thanksgiving dinner and really enjoyed our meal. \n\ni've eaten at many steakhouses in the area and i find that each one has their own unique style. delmonico's interior isn't highly decorated or cluttered, just a simple and clean look. i liked the simplicity. \n\nour waiter and his team were very attentive. water glasses were constantly filled, plates cleared efficiently, and service moved smoothly. they were all very professional. \n\nthe meal begins with popovers that are both soft and flavorful. i began my meal with the <mark>Wilted Spinach and Frise</mark> salad. it was anything, but the usual frisee salad because every ingredient was taken to the next level. the bacon vinaigrette had a nice smoky bacon flavor which was tossed in just the right amount with the spinach. the candied bacon was amazing. they perfectly balanced the sweet and salty. the egg on top was cooked to perfection. all of the flavors worked so well together. \n\nit was hard to order something other than steak, but it was thanksgiving so i had to have my traditional dinner. the thanksgiving dinner didn't disappoint and was a very generous portion. the turkey was very moist and flavorful. the plate had a nice mix of white and dark meat. under piles of turkey was a moist, delicious cornbread stuffing. a delicious gravy was drizzled over the turkey and stuffing. there was a small side of green beans, but those were not the best thing on the plate as they were a stringy and mushy.\n\nmy husband and i split a twice <mark>Baked Idaho Potato</mark> because you have to have potatoes on thanksgiving. i'm glad we split because it was definitely enough for two. the potato was flavorful and covered in a nice cheese layer.\n\nfor dessert i had the pecan pie and my husband had the thanksgiving dessert special. my pecan pie was served like a tart in a small round, flaky crust. the crust was buttery and flaky. i don't like crust usually, but this was very good. there was plenty of gooey pecan filing and a nice heap of ice cream on top. my husband's special dessert was a trio of pumpkin cheesecake, bread pudding, and ice cream. this kind of fell flat. nothing had much flavor and was certainly not the best representation of the dessert menu.\n\ni can't wait to return and try more of the regular menu items."

            "quite delicious! i wouldn't say that this steakhouse is creative or unique, but what i will say is that it's classic, delicious and savory. the decor is comfortable, quietly & minimally luxurious and the service was very good without being intruding. i was dining with my family (sister, mom, father and my husband russ). \n\nfor an appetizer, i ordered the <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> which was very good but not super memorable and for the entree, i ordered the surf and turf. perfection. i found everything to be just as i ordered it and savored every last piece of my meal. we got the bacon-cheddar polenta which was remarkably good and the mashed potatoes (which i didn't try) and also, the <mark>Delmonico Creamed Spinach</mark>. it may not be revolutionary, but delmonico's does good food just right :d\n\ni wouldn't say that i really \"stepped out of my box\" with what i ordered, but i will say that they have a wonderful wine list, a nice group of people working for them, and tasty food. this is the perfect place to dine with a small group or family where everyone can get something they like. it's more of a safe bet while dining in vegas - but a good one. it's also located in the venetian - which is as they say - a \"feast for the eyes\" i like!",

            "i have been on the lookout for the perfect filet for some time now.  my search has put this place on the top of my list.  after years of waiting i finally  was able to dine at the famed delmonico steakhouse in vegas.  i was promised by steak loving friends that the filet was so perfect you didn't need a knife to cut it.\n\nmy wife and i arrived a bit early so we could check out their bar.  the ambiance while very nice, was not what i had expected.  it was also not very busy which also threw me off a bit.  anyway, we sat at the bar and i ordered up my usual (goose martini with 3 blue cheese olives) and my wife ordered a glass of wine.  we chatted up the friendly bar tender, finished our drinks then headed into the main dining area to be seated.\n\nfirst we were given a ginormous wine list that took us 10 minutes to go through and another 10 minutes to decided what we wanted.  we settled on a very reasonably priced bottle and our waiter was not at all pissed that we didn't drop $100's on a bottle.\n\nfirst they bring you a small dinner roll/bread thing that was very unremarkable.  i liked it that they brought you a single roll so i couldn't eat 4 of them and ruin my dinner, but it just wasn't that good so i really didn't want more than one.  probably for the best though.\n\nfor an appetizer we shared the <mark>Creole Boiled Gulf Shrimp Cocktail</mark> which was excellent.  the shrimp were boiled in some creole stuff which gave them a very nice flavor.  they give you 4 large shrimp which is perfect for sharing although i could have eaten them all myself.  if you like super hot cocktail sauce then be sure to ask for a side of horseradish to heat it up some more.\n\nthen we had the <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> which is prepared tableside and is a 2 person portion.  while the salad was pretty good, i wouldn't order it again.  they add some spices to it that i just don't think belong in a salad and gave it an odd flavor.\n\nas per our steakhouse usual, my wife and i split the filet and we both thought it was excellent.  it wasn't perfect, but probably one of the best i have ever had.  it was cooked perfectly, had excellent flavor and the rub they used wasn't too overpowering.  the steak was very tender but not the cut-with-your-fork kind of tender i am looking for.  at 9oz it was a perfect size to split and not feel overly full after our meal.\n\nfor sides we ordered the veggie of the day (broccoli) and the <mark>Roasted Fingerling Potatoes</mark>.  i guess they were pretty good but i should have ordered a few of their less healthy options like <mark>Delmonico Creamed Spinach</mark> or mashed potatoes.  my wife was in charge of the sides this time but next time i'm ordering something good.\n\nmy wife and i are both suckers for desserts made in house so we had to try their pecan pie.  it was ok but i would try sometime else next time like the cheese cake.  i wasn't a fan of the crust but i was a fan of the size; it wasn't huge and was perfect for 2 people to share.\n\nafter dinner my wife ordered a decaf coffee and for some reason i had absinthe.  the after dinner drink menu caught my eye because it had like 5 different selections of absinthe which is very unique.  i asked if i could do a sampler of them all but they said no.  instead, i settled on one and it was very good.  i am not a very experienced absinthe drinker so i really couldn't tell you if it was any better than any other one but it was quite good......and strong.  i still have no idea why the heck i ordered it.\n\nmy entire delmonico experience was excellent.  our entire waitstaff crew (there had to be 4 people waiting on us) were fast, friendly and helpful.  the price for the steak was reasonable and comparable to other steakhouses, but everything else was pretty high.  anyway, i would definitely dine here again and honestly cannot wait to return.",

            "i always try to come here whenever i visit las vegas.  this is probably one of my favorite steakhouses.  i made a reservation with the request of a nice private table.  i arrived at the restaurant and was immediately greeted by the hostess.  i was about 10 minutes early, but being thirsty i wanted to get a drink at the bar anyway.  i ordered a tanqueray and tonic and my date a glass of wine.  drink was made well, just the right amount of gin.  the bar area is nice with a few tables along with the view people walking to and fro from the palazzo.  \n\nwe were brought to out table, a nice and private one which i requested.  our server arrived and told us about the specials for the evening.  the one that stood out was the <mark>Vine-Ripened Heirloom Tomato Salad</mark>.  i then previewed the wine list, which was very very extensive.  i eventually decided on a bone <mark>Bone-In New York Strip</mark> medium rare and my date a scallop dish, as she did not really eat steak.  we also ordered the <mark>Delmonico Creamed Spinach</mark> and mashed potatoes.  we received the <mark>Vine-Ripened Heirloom Tomato Salad</mark>.  the salad was amazing, tomatoes were fresh and full of flavor and just had the right amount of seasoning and dressing (o&v).  when produce is that good, it's always wise to treat it simply, which delmonico did.  after our salad, the server brought over an amuse bouche on the house, which i've had previously.  a tortilla chip with a simple seafood ceviche.  it tasted decent, though i like my ceviche with a little more acid.  i couldn't complain because it was on the house.  a few moments later our main courses arrived.  my steak was cooked perfectly medium rare and just enough seasoning that served to enhance the flavor of the steak.  i could also tell that this <mark>Bone-In New York Strip</mark> was of a high quality cut because of the lack of connective tissue and sinews.  my date's scallop dish was very delicious, but i was so focused on my steak i forgot what the scallops came with, i believe it was served over polenta.  the <mark>Delmonico Creamed Spinach</mark> was decent, though i am usually not a fan of such a heavy side.   the mashed potatoes also were decent.  however the star during this dinner was the steak.  \n\nservice was impeccable.  staff was very friendly and everything came out the way we wanted, in the proper time.  \n\ndelmonico never disappoints.  the only other steakhouse that rivals this in lv is \"cut.\"  though i like the ambience in delmonicos better.  will i come back? yes!!! 5 stars because of phenomenal food, great ambience and impeccable service.", 
            "first impressions......unfortunately, delmonico steakhouse made a huge mistake when they seated my party of three at the table right in front of the kitchen door with a restaurant that was less than half full.  offensive and unacceptable.  the hostess ran in one direction and a staff member told us we would have to make our way back up to the front to deal with this issue when we told them that this would not work for us.  after a word with someone who claimed to be the manager at the front, we were reseated and promptly given complimentary <mark>Truffle and Parmesan Potato Chips</mark> (that can solve any bad first impression).  the <mark>Truffle and Parmesan Potato Chips</mark> are not to be missed.  \n\nservice-  our server eventually warmed up and was pleasant.   he was so caught up in his speeches about different parts of the menu and recommendations, that it took some time to see his true personality.  he was also rushed, which was odd, as we had some menu questions.  \n\nfood-  the filet was magical.  this is the primary reason that the restaurant got 4 stars.  the creole seasoning and dab of butter on the steak were an amazing and sinful treat.  really delicious.\n\nthe cheese grits were delicious.  i was a bit less impressed with the <mark>Delmonico Creamed Spinach</mark>.  the waiter said that it was better than cut's version.  no way!  underwhelming.", 
            "i came here back in 2005 with my family and had a phenomenally memorable meal. six years later -- i came back this past weekend and it was stellar. extensive wine list, excellent service, ridiculously buttery brioche bread, great cocktails, and of course, the food!\n\nfor apps, my party had the <mark>Truffle and Parmesan Potato Chips</mark> (so rich but delish!), <mark>Butternut Squash Ravioli</mark> with duck confit (superb), <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> (mmm with large lobster chunks), and the wedge salad (as perfect as a classic wedge gets). \n\nfor entrees, i had the <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> that was perfectly cooked to a true medium-rare. i often find that, when i order med-rare, more often than not, highly rated restaurants overcook my meat to more of a med to med-well, which is can be disappointing. well, here at delmonico, it was perfect! friends got the <mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark> and the huge $85 fred flinstone steak (i forget the official name), all cooked to perfection. the 2007 joseph phelps cab paired divinely with the steaks. \n\nsides:  creamed corn was mind-blowing; <mark>Delmonico Creamed Spinach</mark> was good but didn't knock my socks off (compared to everything else which did). \n\nwe were too stuffed to order a dessert, but we received a complimentary birthday gelato. nice gesture, but it was not so great -- i think it was a non-conventional flavor, like fennel or something?\n\noverall, i would definitely return the next time i'm in the mood for a (pricey) steak dinner in vegas!!! emeril is a genius!",

            "emeril's delmonico steakhouse is located in the venetian hotel, slightly across from the blue man group theatre. to be honest, i even liked chef emeril much. never cared about his shows or his cooking. guess he made me a believer after this one night dining at delmonico. we made reservations through open table for a party of 12 on a saturday night. we wanted 6:30pm but were only given the options of 5pm or 9pm (fyi, reservations were made about two weeks in advance). we weren't about to pig out then hit the night life scene all bloated and passing gas so we settled for 5pm which worked out anyways. gave us plenty of time to digest and chill. \n\nwe checked in with the three pretty hostesses and were offered to have a seat in their lounge area until our table was ready. barely five minutes passed and our ma\\u00eetre d' came out to fetch us. unfortunately, he wasn't as easy on the eyes as the hostess. however, he took care of us the entire night. i apologize for not remembering his name because he's worth mentioning and deserve recognition: caucasian, arrogant looking but very proper and attentive, and had a dark humor side to him. \n\nthe establishment is quite simple but still very classy. it's dimly lit for you romantic types; unfortunately this was a bromance between 12 obnoxious dudes. the dining rooms and distance between tables were spacious enough so you're able to have some sort of privacy. you can tell that they didn't try to over do the interior design of the place. it's an elegant and clean look.\n\nwe all decided to bypass appetizers and drinks and just went straight for the entrees and side dishes. we figured we'll be pounding enough booze later on the night. after recently having some awesome buffalo in wyoming, i decided to order the three peppercorn crusted american buffalo rib-eye with caramelized cipollini onions and brandy peppercorn reduction ($50). for those of you who are already raising an eyebrow, this chunk of meat was by far gamey. it well cooked, very tender, and seemed to have less fat that then regular bone in rib eye. personally, medium rare is the way to go. i sampled the bone in rib eye from my friend's plate and i have to say that the buffalo is the unanimous winner. a few of the other guys who are traditional beef carnivores decided to try the buffalo also agreed that the buffalo was well worth the try. not to dock the rib eye because that was still very legit.\n\nfor sides, we ordered two of the following to share: saut\\u00e9ed garlic wild mushrooms ($11), new orleans <mark>Delmonico Creamed Spinach</mark> ($9), and the <mark>Creamed Corn Gratine</mark> ($11). it was the perfect amount of sides for the entire table, not over killing it yet a decent amount for each person. all sides were very delish and complimented our meals perfectly.\n\neverything could not have gone smoother. the 12 of us had a nice corner to ourselves. service was top notch. occasionally, they brought out 4-5 servers at once to present all the entrees to us all at the same time. our drinks never ran dry and we were always checked up on every so often. the chef even sent out a sampling which was ground duck rice ball in a sweet and sour sauce. that could've easily been an appetizer order all together and we would've happily ordered it. even the pricing was quite affordable considering the caliber of the steak house delmonico is. i am quite impressed with what chef emeril has done with this restaurant. big props to him and the entire staff for an outstanding meal. i do look forward to future visits.", 
            "on our first night's stay at the venetian, we walked to delmonico in less than 5 minutes and were seated on time.  it took approximately 60 seconds for the staff to begin delivering the bliss.  i am not a steakhouse fan (my husband is), but this restaurant is an emeril restaurant, and having had wonderful experiences at his other establishments in new orleans, i thought we would be in for a treat.  the service was extraordinary even though the restaurant was hustling at by 8 p.m., we had the full attention of our waiter as well as the sommelier and other ancillary staff, which made the evening a lot of fun.  we enjoyed an amuse bouche of heirloom tomatoes, basil, burrata cheese and evoo.  my husband ended up with an enormous piece of meat on his plate (no surprise there) that he stated emphatically was the best steak he'd ever had, accompanied by a terrine-sized dish of the new orleans <mark>Delmonico Creamed Spinach</mark>, easily the best <mark>Delmonico Creamed Spinach</mark> i've ever put in my mouth.  i only wish i had been able to enjoy the leftovers in an omelette the next day for breakfast.\n\ni ordered one of the specials, which was a $42 plate of pasta.  yes, you read right: a $42 plate of pasta.  it was heaven: just the right amount of papparadelle with six very large shrimp, and a generous amount of andouille sausage and artichoke hearts.  i enjoyed a complementary glass of red wine that was a blend of several varietals; complex and nicely balanced, it was a wine that emeril endorsed and labeled, and it had been bottled by au bon climat winery in santa barbara, ca.  i started with the <mark>Organic Baby Mixed Greens Salad</mark>, dressed with a sherry vinaigrette and shaved manchego cheese.  it was perfectly balanced and just the right flavor profile for my mood that night.  we were too full for dessert, but had there been room, my money would have been on emeril's banana cream pie, served with caramel sauce, chocolate shavings and whipped cream. i didn't take pictures at delmonico, but we enjoyed our food immensely and i would return in a heartbeat.  the staff is well-trained and extremely attentive, and the food is unpretentious, well-prepared and top-drawer.", 
            "this is not the delmonicos restaurant of ny. this is an emeril lagasse steakhouse. there is no decoration to speak of. just a large open room with many tables and many people chatting and laughing. we ordered the <mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark> and it was prepared to perfection, but a tad bit too salty for my friend's taste. i loved mine, but you need to be a full-on caveman to eat the whole damn thing. we had the <mark>Delmonico Creamed Spinach</mark> which was coarse and tough to chew and the au gratin potatoes were really good. the sommelier was great and recommended a very nice blend. we were so stuffed, we chose not to have dessert, but they looked quite good. this is a very nice, fancy steakhouse, but cut still gets my vote for the best one around.", 
            "i brought my two friends visiting from london to delmonico's. having never been there before i was a bit nervous. no need for nerves here.\n\nwe had an excellent wait staff take care of us. you are not there for the decor but for the food so don't judge this book by its cover.\n\nmy friends each ordered the filet and i the rib eye. we also ordered the <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark>, the <mark>Delmonico Creamed Spinach</mark> (a must), broccoli and <mark>Roasted Fingerling Potatoes</mark>. everything was divine. my friends both wanted to cry over how perfect their filets were. \n\ni have no idea what wine we had but all in all i could not have asked for a nicer meal. i recommend it for the experience of going as well as the wonderful food.\n\nanother plus is people were dressed for a nice dinner and not in casual shorts and such. the mealk ran about $100.00 per person after everything.", 
            "i'd probably give delmonico four stars, except that my expectations were set higher than they probably should have been. in all honesty, the delmonico did not deliver anything notably better, more worthy of celebrity, than the average high end steak house in nashville - including stoney river, ruth's, or local favorites like sperry's. i guess i thought that for all the critique emeril gives top chef stars, his restaurant would blow me away.\n\nthe homemade <mark>Truffle and Parmesan Potato Chips</mark> were good, and somewhat unique, but perhaps a little over cooked, leaving a numb of chips hard.\n\nour steaks were indeed prepared excellently, and a quality cut of meat. i had the filet, which was an ample serving and cooked to a perfect medium rare.\n\nbut the twice <mark>Baked Idaho Potato</mark> were a big disappointment. <mark>Half Dozen Raw Oysters on the Half Shell</mark> seems to be way overcooked, to the point or requiring a steak knife to cut through them. the flavor was bland, even with cheddar and bacon. a little salt and pepper certainly helped.\n\nwe did enjoy the <mark>Delmonico Creamed Spinach</mark>, even including my colleague who usually doesn't like green things.\n\nthe bread pudding was definitely the way to go on dessert. we also had a slice of banana cream pie, but the star was the bread pudding, which was not ruined with raisins. it was rich, smooth, creamy and delicious.", 
            "our bad experience started with the lady who answered when i called to set a resv. she sounded like she wasn't very happy and didn't make me feel good about planning to go to delmonicos.  \nwe get there and the hostess simply said \"follow me\" she did not make eye contact or even ask \"how's your evening?\" she walked so fast to our table it was hard to keep up.  she sat us, gave us a napkin, said nothing at all, and walked away.  (also they only have white napkins.. i'm used to fine dining where your napkin, either white or black, be offered to go with your ensemble.)\nnext, our server(s), didn't seem to care that we were dining there.  not sure if they judged based on skin color, age, and style of clothes, but it felt like they did.  after offering us drinks and giving us menus, it was about an 8 to 10 minute wait to see our server again.. mind you that we'd chosen what we'd have for dinner and had our menus closed a majority of that time.\noverall for service from beginning til end was way below par for such a place.  we did not feel welcomed nor that they gave 2 funks about us.\nfood:\nmy bone in rib eye was ordered medium and came out medium well, which made it particularly dry and tough.  my spouses bone in rib eye was cooked correctly (medium), but was nothing to call home about.\ni ordered my steak <mark>Oscar Style</mark>.  the asparagus was the highlight of our dinner and the crab seemed a but overlooked and dry.\nwe also had a <mark>Roasted Maine Lobster Tail</mark> each, which came de-shelled and on top of the rib eye.  drawn butter was brought out but lemon was not, nor offered.\nwe had the new orleans style <mark>Delmonico Creamed Spinach</mark>.. the only \"new orleans\" about it was the name.  the spinach tasted fresh but it was about a 3.5/5 on overall taste and quality.\nfor the price there are many better options in las vegas (mastro's ocean club; the capital grille, del frisco's..).  \nwe will surely never return.", 
            "decadent.  delicious.  delightful.  \n\nthat was our experience, celebrating our 3-year wedding anniversary at delmonico's! \n\n#<mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark> ~ a must ($52).  tender, seasoned and delicious.  perfectly cooked medium rare.  we added the <mark>Pan Seared <mark>Foie Gras</mark></mark> accompaniment ($20), which made it incredible.  killer combo and highly recommended!\n\n#corn au gratin ~ piping hot, with crunchy bread crumbs on top.  not too heavy, not too light.  a definite winner.  i could not stop eating it.\n\n#<mark>Delmonico Creamed Spinach</mark> ~ good.  also not too heavy.  but, not mind blowing.  \n\n#wild mushroom pappardelle pasta with truffle ~ a decadent appetizer and quite delicious.  ($20)  this was a dinner special, so i don't know if they regularly have it.  tasty, but quite a small proportion.\n\n#lobster salad with champagne vinaigrette ~ tasty, with a nice chunk of lobster on the side of leafy greens, thinly sliced red onions and halved cherry tomatoes.  ($20) but, nothing to write home about.  \n\n#bread ~ biscuit shaped croissants, with butter.  ok.  would have been better served warm.  \n\nservice was attentive.  our champagne glasses were topped off regularly.  water glasses refilled constantly.  reservations were a piece of cake through opentable.  seated within 5 minutes of arrival.  total bill - $200+ for 2 people.  reasonably priced for fine dining.  \n\nbottom line:  highly recommend and would dine again!  next time, i will leave room for dessert.  creme brulee and bread pudding was on the menu and i heart both!", 
            "i have had the best meal of my life, on 3 separate occasions at emeril lagasse's delmonicos.  i loved how i have never been let down when i have gone there.  i really enjoy steak, and his <mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark> was the best i have ever had - the crust on the medium-rare perfection was amazing.  \n\nthat being said, i expect a great steak at any steakhouse i go to, so that's not enough to make this my best meal ever.  however, the sides and dessert we equally amazing! the <mark>Delmonico Creamed Spinach</mark> is unlike any other i've ever had, the mushroom were succulent, and the football sized <mark>Baked Idaho Potato</mark> really hit the spot.  the service was great, the ambiance is perfect, and the chairs and tables are very comfortable.\n\ni wish i could come here more often.  every time i plan a vegas trip, the sure bet is that i will be here.  i loved it, and i think you would too.", 
            "dinner was fabulous. the bone in ribeye was perfectly done, the filet was blue as requested, not an easily done prep-and spit on. the grits, as well as the <mark>Delmonico Creamed Spinach</mark> very tasty. the banana cream pie a perfectly yummy dessert for two. well worth the price.", 
            "having eaten here now a handful of times, i felt it was time to finally leave a review (not that they need it, based on their stars.) that having been said, it's really hard to go wrong with a steak here! the ny strip is huge, delicious, and, in my experience, cooked to perfection. the sides, while pretty standard fare, are quite good. i find the <mark>Delmonico Creamed Spinach</mark> and mushrooms to be particularly noteworthy, while the asparagus was uninspired. the value is reasonable, in spite of the fairly high price, so no complaints there. with the number of great options in the venetian/palazzo, let alone in las vegas in its entirety, it can be hard to stand out, but delmonico steakhouse manages to do so.", 
            "this is the 3rd time we've been to delmonico & honestly, it keeps getting better! the service is top notch.  our servers were on top of everything but not intrusive & the manager, rene, was friendly  & knowledgeable about all aspects of the restaurant.  for our appetizers, we had oysters on the 1/2 shell, wilted spinach salad & <mark>Heirloom Tomato Soup</mark>.  all were yummy.  we've come to realize that splitting a steak between 3 people is the way to go.  in the past, half our steak would go to waste as these steaks are huge!  we split a bone in ribeye and there was still a couple of pieces left over. the reason you get so full is because the sides at delmonico are out of this world! this time around we had the potatoes au gratin, <mark>Delmonico Creamed Spinach</mark> & creamed corn.  i could make a meal on delmonico side dishes alone - they're that good!  while they've served up delicious desserts in the past (what? no more bread pudding?), we just didn't have room for dessert this time.  i can't wait until we are back in vegas again & have the time to stop by this gem of a restaurant.  it's true culinary bliss!", 
            "this is probably one of my favorite places for steak, bread pudding, or when i wanna eat at the bar alone. here is a summary of one of my experiences that i shared with one of my foodie friends when we ate here. \n\nwe ordered the <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> which was spectacularly prepared fresh able side by the maitre 'd. it was like $30 but probably the best salad of my life! next was the bone in rib eye which was so perfectly seasoned and cooked! i'm a huge fan of sides so i got the <mark>Delmonico Creamed Spinach</mark>, a <mark>Baked Idaho Potato</mark>, creamed corn, and asparagus. yes, there were amazing left overs!\n\nfor dessert of course it was the white chocolate macadamia nut bread pudding! if anyone knows emril's shows or books you know this is like his signature item. i have also had the duck egg creme brulee which is heavenly as well. but my go to is the bread pudding!\n\nthis is a place you probably wouldn't wanna eat at daily, but it is a place to take special friends who enjoy good food at it's best or for an awesome night of self spoiling! :)\n\n*lobster bique, the <mark>Butternut Squash Ravioli</mark> and the fried chicken are killer too!", 
            "what better way to celebrate a big 3-0 than with a mean piece of steak! it was my good friend's birthday and we had two tables reserved for our big group. i must say, service was stellar. staff was knowledgeable with their menu and very patient with us when placing our orders in as we were all quite indecisive and had so many questions.   \n\nstarting off with some bread and aperitif, i chose a glass of blue label chimay as my poison. ahhhh...a wonderful prelude to an evening of indulgence. for appetizers, i had their oyster rockefeller. this baked aphrodisiac was not as cheesy as i hoped it would be but they were fresh and of good quality. i can't complain. \n\nnext came the main show, <mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark> which my man and i split. split plating was beautifully done with the perfect portion for each of us. no fee for split plate, thank you. i like my meat cooked medium and it came as pink as i expected it to be. a dollop of butter topped off my steak but that for me was unnecessary. it had quite a chew to it which was unlikely coming from chef emeril lagasse's kitchen. did it taste bad? no, not at all. i just think that being in vegas where you are surrounded by a plethora of dining options of the same caliber, you need to live up to your name. sadly, i wasn't as impressed by this dish compared to other fellow yelpers. \n\nmy side of choice was the <mark>Delmonico Creamed Spinach</mark>. now we're talking! it tasted sensational with that silky feel of butter and cream. finally, chef emeril's true colors are coming out. and on a sweet note, we ended the evening with emeril's banana cream pie. can i say, wow!? i will have to say this was the best banana cream pie i've had to date. hats off to you, chef! this my friends, earned delmonico steakhouse the 4 stars i'm giving them. \n\nwould i come back? sure! i'll skip the steak and try his southern specialties instead. but more importantly, i shall not forget emeril's banana cream pie. it's to die for!", 
            "i really can't eat steak anywhere else in vegas if i have the opportunity of getting a reservation here.\n\nbone-in rib eye, <mark>Delmonico Creamed Spinach</mark>.  delicious.  no complaints!!!", 
            "there's a reason why emeril lagasse is such a celebrated chef. his restaurant, delmonico steakhouse, provided impeccable service and outstanding food.\n\ndelmonico steakhouse was our big dinner out in vegas for a bachelorette weekend. 9 of us were promptly seated for our 7:30pm sunday reservation. i ordered a glass of malbec (my favorite, which is rather had to find).\n\nas a table, we shared the bbq shrimp (which was just the right hit of smokey and sweet), truffle and parm <mark>Truffle and Parmesan Potato Chips</mark> (uberly addictive) and the lettuce wedge salad.\n\nfor my entr\\u00e9e, i decided to get the bone in ribeye-the house specialty. it did not disappoint. it was quite a large piece of steak, but it didn't stop me from finishing all of it (that's not something i do very often). we split the <mark>Delmonico Creamed Spinach</mark> and the <mark>Creamed Corn Gratine</mark>. the spinach was average but the creamed corn was vegetable candy. \n\nwe ended our meal with emeril's infamous banana cream pie. holy moly. sky high pie packed with bananas, caramel sauce, chocolate shavings, and whipped cream. even though we were all full, we couldn't help but finish it.\n\nour waiter was extremely attentive. service, overall, was phenomenal. when our steaks were ready, there was a server for each plate so we were presented our dishes at the same exact moment. now that's service.\n\nit goes without saying that this was pricey, even for vegas standards, but you get what you pay for. \n\ni highly recommend checking out delmonico at least once.", 
            "located at the venetian hotel and a emeril lagasse establishment. i made reservations for four persons bc our vendor wanted to treat us to dinner.\n\nwe started off with drinks at the beautiful bar and made our way to the plush dinning area. i started off with the gumbo which was superb. for dinner what better choice then the dry aged in house ribeye?  for sides we enjoyed <mark>Sauted Garlic Mushrooms</mark>, asparagus, nola <mark>Delmonico Creamed Spinach</mark> and for dessert i savored the a entire emeril's banana cream pie slice (it was huge and delish). my co worker from phoenix enjoyed the bone in filet and he ended his meal with  key lime pie which he also raved about. \n\nthis was definitely a meal that was memorable and thank you to the entire staff at delmonico steakhouse. it's great knowing i can get a solid nola influenced meal with having to go to nola!", 
            "enjoyed the meal. $50 for a <mark>Filet Mignon</mark>. cooked to perfection. the <mark>Delmonico Creamed Spinach</mark> ($9)  might be the best i ever had. a nice flavor. sort of had a hint of wood burned flavor added to it. the bread that was served with it was like a yorkshire pudding that had a slight wood burned taste...excellent. the coffee was less than average. the service was excellent.  (only odd thing...when the crumbs were cleaned off the table while i was between a course, they were not cleaned to a plate, but the empty chair).", 
            "juicy ribeye <mark><mark>Ahi Tuna</mark> and Salmon Tartare</mark> \n\nthe service was very good here. i really loved the ribeye, <mark><mark>Ahi Tuna</mark> and Salmon Tartare</mark>, and their complimentary bread. the price is decent for an upscale dining restaurant. \n\ni tried other dishes my friends got and they weren't as good. my friends didn't really enjoy their <mark>Filet Mignon</mark>. i tried the <mark>Double Cut Kurobuta Pork Chop</mark> and i thought the sauce was very salty. the bacon appetizer was good but tasted a bit salty as well. the creamed corn was very good but i didn't really like the bread crumbs on top of it. the <mark>Delmonico Creamed Spinach</mark> was just ok. the potato side dish was just ok too. \n\nif you have an occasion you are celebrating they give you a sorbet. they also gave us a small mousse type dish for being there for the first time so that was nice. the decor is simple and had a nice ambiance. it's a nice place to try in venetian regardless.", 
            "after a quick drink at public house, i was feeling pretty good, and hungry, and a little buzzed. here's how my conversation with our waiter began:\n\nme: \"what kind of bread is this?\"\nwaiter: \"they're popovers sir.\"\nme: \"has anyone ever commented that they're shaped like dicks?\" \nwaiter: \"haha, no sir, very good observation sir.\" \n\nyup, their popovers were pretty much shaped like dicks. they were a bit cold, oily, and combined with the refrigerated butter (one of my pet peeves at restaurants), a big disappointment. despite the phallic start to dinner, the rest of the meal and service was excellent. \n\nthe recommended <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> was a great way to cleanse my palate of that bread. there were big chunks of lobster meat and the bisque was well-seasoned without going overboard with the salt. delmonico is known for their <mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark> so i ordered that medium-rare. the steak was more on the medium side, but no complaints here as it was just as juicy and tender. no steak is complete without a side of <mark>Delmonico Creamed Spinach</mark>, which was done well. all sides are portioned to be shared. despite a misstep with my friend's order (bone-in ny strip instead of boneless), service was spot on.",

            "i had been to delmonico when they first opened years ago and was so impressed. this time, i was definitely underwhelmed. first,we had a 5:00 reservation and there right when they opened. we had stated on our reservations that it was was our anniversary. we got no acknowledgement of it and were seated at the worst table in the restaurant in a corner with a cheap floor lamp that was covered in dust next to us. no one was even in the restaurant, so they could have given us a nice booth. it was still dead there at 6:30 when we left. on to the food. popovers were just ok. hubby's ribeye was yummy. my filet however, was dry as the sahara and had no flavor. not a speck of juice ran out when i cut into it. my hubby said it looked like jerky. so disappointed. sides <mark>Delmonico Creamed Spinach</mark> and twice <mark>Baked Idaho Potato</mark> were just ok. twice baked was just a big greasy glob of cheese and wasn't even hot. for dessert, we got the banana cream pie. it was good but i was expecting it to wow me based on what others had said about it. sadly, i don't think i'll be back. for the price, i'd rather have mastros or ruth's chris.",

            "prior to our trip, a few of us wanted to do a steak dinner in vegas and we agreed on delmonicos. delving into the menu so i had an idea in mind of what i would be ordering, i became intrigued immensely when i saw that it was under emeril's.\n\nwe were fortunate to be seated a little early. the ambiance of course evokes an intimate and formal setting with the dim lighting. the decor was minimal and i felt there could have used some art pieces.\n\nlet me say the service was top-notch. although it is what you'd expect from such an establishment, very few places achieve such high marks imo.\nthe water glasses were never empty and it felt like we didn't really have a server but a rotation of different people that comprised the waitstaff. i counted at least 6 different people between taking our order, serving the appetizers, the main course, side dishes, wine, filling the waters and dessert. \n\nappetizer: <mark>Ahi Tuna</mark> & <mark><mark>Ahi Tuna</mark> and Salmon Tartare</mark>: superb. i liked how the cucumber salad complemented the tuna & salmon and came in a spiraled form. the wonton chips were crispy and a nice form used for stacking the tartare & salad on. the wasabi provided a nice bite and offered a different note with the tartare. \n\nmain course: ribeye (no-bone). some say the meat tastes better on the bone. in this case i found the ribeye to be succulent, juicy well seasoned and cooked to perfection. frankly i don't think it would have made much of difference if it was on the bone or not based on the flavor. adding on the butter on top was a nice feature to the steak. \n\nsides: all the sides were delicious and was about the right amount to share for 3 (4 if the people aren't big eaters. \n\n<mark>Potato Gratin</mark>: so good i couldn't stop eating it. \n\n<mark>Delmonico Creamed Spinach</mark>: no joke and the right balance of cream to tone down the strong taste of spinach was harmonic. \n\nasparagus: i'm not an asparagus fan but if asparagus always tasted this good, it might crack my top 3 favorite vegetables. had the right amount of salt and seasoning to create a more palatable asparagus. \n\ndessert: sorbet; 3 scoops, 3 flavors. strawberry, banana and the 3rd resembled coconut. i found the sorbet to be a more suitable and lighter offering vs. if it was an ice cream or gelato.\nclean flavors and the banana was surprisingly interesting given the fact its not something one often comes across.",

            "we originally booked reservations at another restaurant. then we decided to go to the diana ross show so decided to go to delmonico so we wouldn't have to rush after the show. what a great choice. we had the fries oysters and i could've had three orders. they were perfectly prepared and so savory! we were served several piping hot pop over rolls with rosemary baked into them. they literally melt in your mouth. it was late and we weren't super hungry so we decided to try several small plates.  we split the salmon. the salmon was perfect. a bit spicy, a bit sweet with potato hash and andoulle sausage. we also had the <mark>Delmonico Creamed Spinach</mark>, bbq shrimp and the grits. i didn't love the grits but everything else was awesome. they have a full selection of bourbons (an entire book) which made my bf very happy. i had a really crisp rose' .. it was really good. the staff works as a team to make sure no needs go unmet. nicole was so engaging and accommodating. we will go back next time we are in town."

            "las vegas...i have so many unforgettable memories...\n\ni first came to this sin city on a cold winter night with my college roommates.  the youngest of us had just turned 21 and we needed to prove we were adults.  back then, new york new york was the hottest hotel on the strip and we went crazy, imitating diana ross and the supremes (i would say we were the original \"dreamgirls\" and i have pictures to prove it).  we couldn't afford a lobster for each person, so we shared 1 among 4 of us. we were young, naive, dirt poor and shameless.  \n\nsummer in vegas is a miserable time, and my sisters and i braved that heat by looking at the bellagio water fountain in awe.  that water show is still the favorite part of my trip every time i go to vegas.  of course, this all happened before \"ocean's eleven\" featured that famous last scene.  i don't think we looked as cool as brad and george though...\n\ni swore to myself that i'd never be back to this city after our incident at a club.  we got kicked out for having too much fun!!!  it was for a bachelorette party, and i think paris hilton was slightly jealous because we drew more crowd than her performance on that night.  we continued to party on in our suite and i discovered that night that jacuzzi could make even the most prude girl hot and steamy!!!\n\ni am no longer young nor have enough energy to party all night, but vegas proved to be a great place to have some of the finest dining experiences one can enjoy.  this time, our sole purpose of the trip was to eat at delmonico steakhouse, and what a fantastic night we had!!!\n\nsome of us had been here before, so the night started with the chef's complimentary appetizer which was a capane of smoke salmon on puff pastry.  a bottle of red wine was chosen from their extensive wine list along with fried calamari and <mark>Emeril's New Orleans Barbecue Shrimp</mark> as appetizers.  i can't make a comment on the wine, but the calamari had overwhelming amount of olives for my taste.  i did love the shrimp as they were cooked perfectly in that tangy sweet bbq sauce.\n\nsome of us were disappointed that the restaurant no longer offered <mark>Double Cut Kurobuta Pork Chop</mark>, but the special of the night was pork tenderloin with braised bacon, and they happily opted for it.  a couple of us ordered a bone in filet, the bf ordered a bone in ribeye and i got a <mark>Filet Mignon</mark>.  my butterflied medium steak was perfectly charred outside with some pink inside and it was very tender and juicy.  i tasted the pork dish and i loved every part of it.  i never knew that a chunk of bacon could be so buttery and sweet, and the cane syrup they used to braise was just perfect for that white fatty meat.  the highlight of the night was the bone in ribeye.  that thing was huge with so much flavor!!!  i rarely eat any pink meat, but the bf's medium rare steak was so delicious i didn't care for the color of it.  seriously, if you ever get a chance to go to delmonico, get their bone in ribeye.  you'll thank me forever for the best steak ever!!!\n\nwe also ordered sauteed garlic mushroom and <mark>Roasted Fingerling Potatoes</mark>.  it was a mushroom heaven with all different kinds of them (shiitake, button, oyster, portebello, etc) cooked in chopped garlic and the aroma itself could make someone's mouth watery.  those purple, yellow and red potatoes side dish was recommended by our maitre d' and it didn't disappoint us.  maybe it could be too heavy for a light eater with all that meat, but for a person like me (a meat & potato girl), i couldn't ask for a better meal.\n\ni must say this steakhouse is a place to impress someone.  it's a huge restaurant, but since it was sectioned into 3 different rooms, it rather felt intimate and quaint.  small tables were cornered so you could be private and although the restaurant was busy, i never felt rushed.  the waiters were not those friendly joker types, but the service we received was more than adequate and appropriate.  \n\ndelmonico renewed my faith in vegas.  i was impressed...i was happy...i was glad to be back to vegas where i have the good, the bad and the ugly memories of my \"peak\" time!  this dining experience (not just the food) tops as one of my favorite moments in vegas.", 
            "the past few visits to the venetian hotel i've made it a point to eat at demonico's. the service is impeccable, waiters remove plates the second you are finished and they are very approachable. the most recent trip i had the braised pork appetizer w/cranberry, creole mustard and basil which was delicious. the entree consisted of the charbroiled bone-in <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> with roasted root vegetables, <mark>Roasted Fingerling Potatoes</mark> and jumbo onion rings. very fun. thanks to hector, my server, everything arrived on time and well prepared.", 
            "we got here at 730pm with reservations at 8pm, so we waited for a little bit in their \"lounge.\" here, i asked for water, and the waitress gracefully brought me a glass, even though we were probably expected to order an alcoholic beverage. we waited about 15 minutes in their lounge, and then a waitress took us to our seats. the restaurant was surprisingly large, and we were seated in the middle of the back room. i was surprised at the decor, it was rather.. plain.  plain white walls with dim lighting.. it kind of felt like we were just being seated in a large room. after sitting, the waiter explained to us about the menu, and then left a very large book of alcoholic beverages for us to look over as well.  the menu wasnt too large, which was good for indecisive people like us. :)\n\nto start, we ordered a <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> ($12.50) to share, esp after reading the rave reviews about it here. like i said, not hyped. it was sensational. it was so smooth, creamy, and rich, mmm.. i'm drooling right now just thinking about it. for our entrees, i ordered the <mark>Colorado Rack of Lamb</mark> ($48) with a side of <mark>Roasted Fingerling Potatoes</mark> ($9), and the friend ordered one of their specials of the night--blue cheese covered bone-in filet with bacon ($55) with a side of saut\\u00e9ed <mark>Sauted Garlic Mushrooms</mark> ($9). i'll start with the sides. the potatoes were okay.. nothing too spectacular.. a little bit on the salty side.. but it was a good side if you need veggies (or veggie-related) along with your meat. the mushrooms were good. tasty, cooked nicely, and i dont even like mushrooms! i ordered the lamb cooked to medium, and it was still slightly too red for me, but it was good nonetheless. a little bit on the fatty side, but it was tasty, and came with a popover.. which is this egg-battered bread thing that went really well with the lamb sauce. i actually had a bite of the friend's steak before i dug into my lamb, and boy.. that steak was fabulous! the blue cheese, bacon, steak, and tangy sauce that came with it made the steak utterly orgasmic. perfect blend of flavors. the meat practically melts in your mouth. friend got the steak in medium rare, but it seemed slightly more cooked than it should've been. it definitely didnt take away the tenderness though, this was the best steak i've had in my life (and i only took a couple of bites from it). this was one of the specials though, so it probably wont always be available. just writing about it right now is making my stomach grumble. i was craving to see what their desserts would taste like. we decided to go with the chocolate bread pudding ($10). it was really chocolate-y, but for chocolate-lovers like me, it was perfect. it was the cherry on top of an already great meal.", 
            "while at vegas, our friends out of the blue, wanted to go eat at a nice restaurant for dinner since it was fight night and all the clubs would have a long line. they made the reservations around 4pm for a 9:30pm dinner, so making reservations last minute isn't a problem.\n\nthough we arrived on time, we had to wait at least 15 minutes to get seated, so we just waited at the bar. i thought the bar area looked better than the actual dining area itself. it was modern and sleek, with a piano situated at the far side of the room.\n\nour hostess took us into the dining area, where we were immediately greeted by our smiling waitress. very attentive, nice, and down to earth, explained the specials and menu to us. meanwhile, the busboys/girls gave us hot bread, which my filipino friends said tasted like filipino bread. it was topped with finely grated cheese and salt, and they loved it. our waters were constantly refilled before it was even half empty.\n\nwe all ordered either the rib-eye off the bone ($42), or the bone in rib-eye ($46). 14 to 16 oz. for the rib-eye. i tried both the steaks and they tasted the same to me. it was dry-aged 14 days, which you could tell when you sliced the meat with your knife. tender, flavorful, delicious! i loved that the sides were encrusted with pepper and salt. my other friend ordered the filet-mignon, which she could not finish. i loved how it melted in your mouth and it was also very flavorful. we got the <mark>Country Smashed Potatoes</mark>, the <mark>Baked Idaho Potato</mark>, and the <mark>Roasted Fingerling Potatoes</mark>. the <mark>Roasted Fingerling Potatoes</mark> tasted the best. i thought it was perfect the way it was salted. the other 2 potatoes didn't stand out to me. \n\ndecor was minimal and sort of disappointing. the bathrooms were kind of disgusting to me because it seemed as if they didn't clean it much. the meal was delicious, but i still love mastro's more! \n\nat the end of our meal, one of the waiters kept coming by our table asking us if we needed help with our bill (because we had a party of 9). he came five times. it was super annoying and it seemed that he was afraid we'd dine and run or something just because it was taking awhile for us to figure out how to calculate tax and tip and collecting money from people.\n\ni'd definitely come here again, but after i try other steakhouses in vegas!", 
            "best meal ever! (also the most expensive...but worth it).\n\nthe food was just unbelieveable. we had a special gnocchi/lump crab appetizer, wedge salad, filet & ribeye, <mark>Roasted Fingerling Potatoes</mark> w/garlic, and pecan pie for dessert. food coma! everything was absolutely perfect and the service was excellent. highly recommended for a special occasion.", 
            "went here for our 1 year wedding anniversary and we were very pleased with our visit with some exceptions...\n\nwe ordered:\n\nappetizer: calamari\ni liked it, but it was way too much for 2 people.  i think i could have done it without the olives - i let the husband order this one.  i would have picked something different.  \n\nsalad: it was the special - arugula, figs, and mousse <mark>Pan Seared <mark>Foie Gras</mark></mark>\nthe husband was a bit iffy, but because i let him pick the appetizer, he couldn't say much.  holy crap, that was a yummy fricken salad even the husband liked it!!  i would so order that again.\n\nmain courses:\nhusband - <mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark>. \nme - bone-in new york steak.\nboth were yummy!  they were both cooked to order.  the only thing we didn't like about it was the butter that came on top of both of them.  we didn't think it was neccessary.     \n\nside dish:\n<mark>Roasted Fingerling Potatoes</mark> with halves garlic.  \nthis was a waste.  we didn't really eat any of them because they were way too salty.  i love me some salt too, but it was just way too much for heart to handle.  we should have asked for something different, but i didn't want to wait.  we did have a show to catch.\n\nthumbs up:\nthey did recognize our anniversary and gave us a complimentary dish before our salad came out.  i forgot what it was, but it consisted of a chip of some sort, with a slice of beef on top.  it tasted it like it had ginger, soy, and some more stuff and also sesame seeds.  it was really good!  i wish we had more or could have swapped it out with the calamari.", 
            "as i have been to the emeril delmonico restaurant in new orleans and enjoyed it immensely, i decided to have dinner at the delmonico steakhouse located in the venetian resort hotel & casino where i was attending the phantom of the opera later that evening (incredible show by the way!).  what you'll find is a variety of food selections with creole influences. \n\nfirst the menu prices are expensive ($$$$) but you are there for the intimate and fine dining experience and should be expecting to pay those prices.  what i didn't expect was to be dressed up and have an individual in shorts, sandals, and a baltimore colts jersey seated at an adjacent table to me.  kind of lowered my view of this establishment being world class if you know what i mean.\n\ni started with the <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> which was just superb but did lack the \"creole\" twist i was expecting (the bam factor).  only thing that was a little of an inconvenience was the lobster pieces were quite large and were hard to cut with my spoon.  the wife selected the <mark>Organic Baby Mixed Greens Salad</mark> creole spiced croutons, sherry vinaigrette, shaved manchego cheese roasted teardrop tomatoes and shaved red onion.  i had a taste and it was very good.  the different flavors were unique and distinctive.\n\nthe main course i selected a pinot noir wine that to go along with my ribeye steak and selected the <mark>Roasted Fingerling Potatoes</mark> and whole garlic with fresh herbs.  the wine was fantastic with a rich and bold body and floral aroma.  wasn't dry and complimented the ribeye steak very well.  the ribeye has emeril's classic touch written all over it with the blackened spice rub with a pat of herb butter on top.  the cut was 1-1/2 inches thick, lean, and very large portion.  the potato dish was okay, didn't impress me in any way.  the wife also had the pinot noir and selected the <mark>Filet Mignon</mark>.  the cut had to be nearly 2 inches thick, lean, and a normal portion size.  i recommend selecting your ribeye to be cooked medium rare (i do not recommend medium) and your <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> medium rare or at the most medium.  \n\nsorry to say we were extremely full when we finished and couldn't partake of dessert.  the meal described above with tip was roughly $210.", 
            "i have been on the lookout for the perfect filet for some time now.  my search has put this place on the top of my list.  after years of waiting i finally  was able to dine at the famed delmonico steakhouse in vegas.  i was promised by steak loving friends that the filet was so perfect you didn't need a knife to cut it.\n\nmy wife and i arrived a bit early so we could check out their bar.  the ambiance while very nice, was not what i had expected.  it was also not very busy which also threw me off a bit.  anyway, we sat at the bar and i ordered up my usual (goose martini with 3 blue cheese olives) and my wife ordered a glass of wine.  we chatted up the friendly bar tender, finished our drinks then headed into the main dining area to be seated.\n\nfirst we were given a ginormous wine list that took us 10 minutes to go through and another 10 minutes to decided what we wanted.  we settled on a very reasonably priced bottle and our waiter was not at all pissed that we didn't drop $100's on a bottle.\n\nfirst they bring you a small dinner roll/bread thing that was very unremarkable.  i liked it that they brought you a single roll so i couldn't eat 4 of them and ruin my dinner, but it just wasn't that good so i really didn't want more than one.  probably for the best though.\n\nfor an appetizer we shared the <mark>Creole Boiled Gulf Shrimp Cocktail</mark> which was excellent.  the shrimp were boiled in some creole stuff which gave them a very nice flavor.  they give you 4 large shrimp which is perfect for sharing although i could have eaten them all myself.  if you like super hot cocktail sauce then be sure to ask for a side of horseradish to heat it up some more.\n\nthen we had the <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> which is prepared tableside and is a 2 person portion.  while the salad was pretty good, i wouldn't order it again.  they add some spices to it that i just don't think belong in a salad and gave it an odd flavor.\n\nas per our steakhouse usual, my wife and i split the filet and we both thought it was excellent.  it wasn't perfect, but probably one of the best i have ever had.  it was cooked perfectly, had excellent flavor and the rub they used wasn't too overpowering.  the steak was very tender but not the cut-with-your-fork kind of tender i am looking for.  at 9oz it was a perfect size to split and not feel overly full after our meal.\n\nfor sides we ordered the veggie of the day (broccoli) and the <mark>Roasted Fingerling Potatoes</mark>.  i guess they were pretty good but i should have ordered a few of their less healthy options like <mark>Delmonico Creamed Spinach</mark> or mashed potatoes.  my wife was in charge of the sides this time but next time i'm ordering something good.\n\nmy wife and i are both suckers for desserts made in house so we had to try their pecan pie.  it was ok but i would try sometime else next time like the cheese cake.  i wasn't a fan of the crust but i was a fan of the size; it wasn't huge and was perfect for 2 people to share.\n\nafter dinner my wife ordered a decaf coffee and for some reason i had absinthe.  the after dinner drink menu caught my eye because it had like 5 different selections of absinthe which is very unique.  i asked if i could do a sampler of them all but they said no.  instead, i settled on one and it was very good.  i am not a very experienced absinthe drinker so i really couldn't tell you if it was any better than any other one but it was quite good......and strong.  i still have no idea why the heck i ordered it.\n\nmy entire delmonico experience was excellent.  our entire waitstaff crew (there had to be 4 people waiting on us) were fast, friendly and helpful.  the price for the steak was reasonable and comparable to other steakhouses, but everything else was pretty high.  anyway, i would definitely dine here again and honestly cannot wait to return.", 
            "naomi and i went here on our date night.  \n\nwe shared a 16oz bone-in prime rib.  it was excellent, cooked to perfection. the steak is large enough for two.\n\nwe also had the <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> and <mark>Traditional New Orleans Gumbo</mark>. we liked both, but my favorite was the gumbo. naomi's favorite was the <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark>. both were awesome and would order them again.\n\nthe <mark>Roasted Fingerling Potatoes</mark> and whole garlic with fresh herbs were good, but not memorable.\n\ni didn't care for the <mark>Truffle and Parmesan Potato Chips</mark>.\n\nthe atmosphere and service were both excellent.\n\nwe shall return!", 
            "it takes a lot for me to give 5 yelp stars to a restaurant. i'm the type of yelper that just loves to find things to hate about the restaurants i dine in. i love being critical, what can i say. but, as much as it pains me to say this, i didn't find one thing i hated about delmonico steakhouse. (argh!!)\n\nthe <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark>. excellent. best <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> i've ever had in my life. hands down. add a little bit of cracked pepper on top and you have a wonderful tasting starter complete with its generous portion of lobster meat. i should've asked for a second order of it.\n\nmy ribeye was perfectly cooked and flavorful. ribeye is usually a cut of meat with a good amount of fat on it. my ribeye had the perfect balance of meat and fat. fat means flavor, people! i was glad i didn't have to cut off too much of it from my meat. we ordered a side of <mark>Roasted Fingerling Potatoes</mark> (w/ whole garlic and fresh herbs) and <mark>Buttered Fresh Broccoli</mark>. these sides complimented my ribeye very well, but i'm being a little biased here because broccoli and <mark>Roasted Fingerling Potatoes</mark> are my favorite veggies (#1 and #2, respectively). i couldn't finish the massive 16 oz. piece of meat and the sides, so i took them all to go. i wound up eating the rest of it for breakfast the next morning. can you say best breakfast ever? yes.\n\napart from a patron at the restaurant that was loud and sounded like mr. krabs from spongebob squarepants, my dining experience here was top notch! i couldn't ask for more from the food, service, and ambiance. you're welcome, delmonico steakhouse...", 
            "my friend and i really wanted to try one of the best steakhouses in vegas, and people kept telling us about how great delmonico was, so we gave it a try. it was my friend's birthday dinner and she is a huge meat eater, i on the other hand don't actually like steak all that much, but wow! it is absolutely impossible not to enjoy your meal here. \n\nwe were in a rush because we had tickets to a show and we were already running late. we advised our maitre d' that we had barely one hour to eat dinner and be on our way. he went above and beyond to make sure we got service fast and made the show on time. not only was he absolutely efficient in making sure our food came out quickly, but he was also super friendly and attentive with us. \n\nour cocktails took no time at all to arrive and were done perfectly. we didn't have time to get appetizers which was a big disappointment, so we went straight for the main course. i had the rib eye and <mark>Country Smashed Potatoes</mark>, my friend had the fillet mignon and <mark>Roasted Fingerling Potatoes</mark>, and we also shared some <mark>Buttered Fresh Asparagus</mark>. all the food was top notch and delicious. my rib eye was cooked to a perfect medium rare, and was well seared on the outside. like i said, i don't particularly like steak but this was mind blowing amazing! i had a few bites of my friend's fillet mignon and it was melt in your mouth goodness. i don't know that it could be possible, but it was even better than my rib eye. amazing. \n\nthe sides were also very good, specially the <mark>Country Smashed Potatoes</mark> which were buttery and creamy. they had bacon and what i think were leeks in them. yum. the asparagus were cooked to perfection and seasoned just right. i did not try the fingerling but my friend said she wasn't overly impressed by them. \n\nmy friend was also surprised with an apple cider sorbet and a candle - for her birthday. the sorbet was delicious, light and refreshing. all in all our visit to delmonico was fantastic and worth every single dollar we paid. dinner here is pricey, but seriously if you find yourself in las vegas, you'd be crazy not to come here!", 
            "i came here for my bros bachelor party and we had a party of 5. i made a reservation on opentable.com while i was at work and it was very convenient! we walked over here on saturday night around 6 to start the night off right with a good steak dinner. this place came highly recommended from a friend. \n\nthe restaurant was overly amazing. it was clean and dimly light like most steak places. the waiters were knowledgeable and prompt with their service. i got kind of a pretentious vibe from our waiter which was a little off putting. but it didnt bother me too much.\n\ni ordered the <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> medium rare and it was cooked to perfection. i was very impressed. the steak was soft and flavorful and melted in my mouth. the side dishes were just ok. we ordered broccoli, <mark>Delmonico Creamed Spinach</mark>, and <mark>Roasted Fingerling Potatoes</mark>. i wasnt impressed by the sides all that much. not extremely flavorful but still decent.\n\nwe also ordered a $200 bottle of wine which was the most expensive wine i have drank before. i didnt know much about it, the winery was called mastery and it was a red wine. my bro ordered it not me and it was really good! it was listed on the last page of the wine menu and was $40 a glass, but we ordered a bottle for the table. i wish i figured out what wine it was but it was really really good.\n\nthis is a good spot for a vegas dinner and a great way to start the night! i would definitely check out some other places before i come back here but i recommend it!", 
            "my new husband and i just got married in vegas on the 4th of august, and we went here on the 6th to celebrate during our vacation. we called for reservations on the day of, and they were able to accommodate us. when we arrived early, we sat in the bar area, and we had the most amazing drinks we both had ever had. i had a \"green spade\" which had cucumber, basil, and some other stuff in it. it was light, not to sweet and delicious. he had a bloody orange, which is a whiskey cocktail, and he loved it equally. i also had a limelight, which was good, and the best was the dark roast....delicious, smooth and incredible. they were about $14 a piece, and worth every damn penny. we were seated 15 minutes early. we told the waiter that this was our first \"casual fine dining\" experience, and he was more than informative. made suggestions throughout the meal, and was personable and forthcoming. they had a nice \"our top picks\" for the wine. we chose a mid-price cab sav. they gave us complimentary truffle cream for an app, and then we ordered the tuna to go with it. the tuna was just average, but we live in cocoa beach, so it's hard to impress us with seafood. the main event was the <mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark>. i have eaten a shit ton of steak in my life....and dear god. this steak was impeccable. i didn't need a knife, i used my fork to cut it. the seasoning was just right, and i ordered mine rare, and that was how it was. my husbands was just the right medium rare....and perfect. now, the only negative part of our meal. i ordered <mark>Roasted Fingerling Potatoes</mark> and asparagus as our sides. i had to send the potatoes back. they were nearly raw, and dry. the asparagus was edible, but boring. at nine dollars a piece, i expect a little zing. we were too full for dessert, but i'm sure it was great. the service was perfect, three waiters to a table. i was impressed with our overall bill total. they gave us cards that detailed where we sat and what waiters we had, so that we could have the same ones next year when we return for our anniversary. i will def be willing to return for another beautiful, whole experience.", 
            "first time here and i will be back!\n\ni made reservations a week before on their website and asked for a nice table.\n\nmy party of 4 arrived early, but no problem- they had our table ready for us!\n\nwe ordered a bottle of cabernet sauvignon ($65) and had the following:\n\ni ordered two appetizers for my entree:\n1. <mark>Vine-Ripened Heirloom Tomato Salad</mark> with burrata cheese, red onion, extra\nvirgin olive oil, balsamic vinegar and torn local basil.\n- i was a little sad that the burrata cheese was so small compared to the heirloom tomatoes, but it was delicious!\n\n2. <mark>Butternut Squash Ravioli</mark> with sage brown butter, toasted hazelnuts and parmesan\n- omg!  so good!  the squash was divine.  i would definitely order this again.\n\n3. grilled marinated organic <mark>Herb Marinated Chicken Breast</mark> - <mark>Roasted Fingerling Potatoes</mark>, whole\ngarlic, wild mushrooms and natural reduction\n- the person that ate this said that the chicken was cooked perfectly and had really good flavor.\n\n4. <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> w/ a twice <mark>Baked Idaho Potato</mark> (with bacon and vermont cheddar) and a <mark>Caesar Salad</mark>.\n- he said that the steak melted in his mouth!\n\n5. surf & turf- bone in ribeye and crab & <mark>Buttered Fresh Asparagus</mark>, i believe.

            "i brought my two friends visiting from london to delmonico's. having never been there before i was a bit nervous. no need for nerves here.\n\nwe had an excellent wait staff take care of us. you are not there for the decor but for the food so don't judge this book by its cover.\n\nmy friends each ordered the filet and i the rib eye. we also ordered the <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark>, the <mark>Delmonico Creamed Spinach</mark> (a must), broccoli and <mark>Roasted Fingerling Potatoes</mark>. everything was divine. my friends both wanted to cry over how perfect their filets were. \n\ni have no idea what wine we had but all in all i could not have asked for a nicer meal. i recommend it for the experience of going as well as the wonderful food.\n\nanother plus is people were dressed for a nice dinner and not in casual shorts and such. the mealk ran about $100.00 per person after everything.", 
            "i came here with some girlfriends during my bachelorette weekend in vegas. we had a reservation for 7 girls, and were very promptly sat at our reservation hour.\n\nthe service here is spectacular, and the food is equally enjoyable. my girls and i shared our entrees and side dishes, so that we could each have a taste of a little bit of everything.\n\nentrees:\n- <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> - 9 oz, and absolutely melt-in-your-mouth yummy. this cut was like butter.\n- <mark>Emeril's BBQ Salmon</mark> - also melted like butter with every bite. it was amazing how tender, yet well-cooked the fish was. the hash side dish that came with the meal was very complimentary!\n- grilled marinated organic <mark>Herb Marinated Chicken Breast</mark> - mostly juicy (a teeny bit dry), but great flavors. the <mark>Roasted Fingerling Potatoes</mark> were pretty standard, and the wild mushrooms weren't very tasty to me.\n- bone in ribeye - 20 oz, and great for sharing! our waiter even cut the steak for our girls so that each could have medium rare/well.\n- american red snapper - the sides didn't seem as appealing at first for my friend who had this dish, but she ended up enjoying them!\n\nsides:\n- creamed corn gratin\\u00c9e - delicious. a great combination of that sweet and salty flavor. texture was right on point!\n- <mark>Buttered Fresh Asparagus</mark> - fabulous crunch, and not so much flavor added to cover up the natural enjoyable flavor of the veggie\n\nall in all, a great experience. we weren't too full at the end of the meal, and didn't have to worry about wasting any food or taking back any leftovers.\n\nhighly recommended!", 
            "first off, to make the most of your experience, you should know what to expect from delmonico service by doing your yelp homework. this place doesn't get a full 5 stars because of the service. \n\nit's been a while since i've felt so insulted by a server. i don't even know his name since he didn't introduce himself, so i know him as the big guy with a beard. he was unfriendly and wrote us off immediately when the table next to us wanted to share half of their <mark>Seafood Tower</mark> with us (it's massive and delicious by the way... thank you amazing strangers from new mexico!).\n\nwe were celebrating an anniversary and greeted warmly by the host stand, but while other yelpers say that their servers brought them a scoop of sorbet to celebrate, we got nothing. so hold your server accountable to giving you the experience you deserve for the price tag you pay. he would have gotten 30% if he wasn't such a douche.\n\nonto the food!\n- <mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark>: duh, do as all 1100 yelp reviews say and get this! fantastic marbling with an amazing crust. and yes... share a steak and order some other stuff! \n\n- <mark>Roasted Fingerling Potatoes</mark>- a light hint of rosemary and more potatoes than a patch on a farm. really tasty and beautiful. sides all seem easily shareable for four people.\n\n- <mark>Delmonico Creamed Spinach</mark>- not too heavy on seasoning, but perfectly delicious and enjoyable. perfect with the ribeye.\n\n- <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark>- if you get this, i would highly recommend sharing. it's too rich and heavy to eat a whole bowl.\n\n- penis-shaped pop-overs (as another yelp reviewer notes)- try a bite, but save room for appetizers!\n\nat the end of the day, i would certainly come back for the food. you will end up ordering too much because everything sounds delicious; next time we'll be trying bbq shrimp and truffled <mark>Truffle and Parmesan Potato Chips</mark> too!", 
            "every single thing that we have tried here was above expectations. had the <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> and <mark>Colorado Rack of Lamb</mark> with <mark>Roasted Fingerling Potatoes</mark> and <mark>Sauted Garlic Mushrooms</mark>. the filet was oh so soft and the lamb was ever so juicy! will come back here for yet another dinner splurge.", 
            "one of the best steaks of my life! we were there may of 2014. we had to modify our reservation as we were running late and they were able to accommodate us around 830pm. they served this little puff bread with butter and it literally melted in my mouth. i have been dreaming of those since then! i chose the ribeye and my boyfriend chose the new york steak. both steaks were seared to perfection! i chose mashed potatoes which was delicious but my boyfriend got the <mark>Roasted Fingerling Potatoes</mark> which were to die for. the herbs it simmered in was mouth watering! we were even impressed when they delivered a complimentary melon sorbet with happy anniversary written in chocolate. it was a delicious delight and we cant wait to go back again!", 
            "do not go unless you love salt!  \ni took my husband to delmonico for his birthday last night and we were both very disappointed with the food. his filet looked so dry and shriveled, i was surprised they served it. there was no \"essence\" only a lot of salt. he chocked it down because he didn't want to disappoint me. i had the <mark>Herb Marinated Chicken Breast</mark> with <mark>Roasted Fingerling Potatoes</mark> and onion sauce. someone must have shaked a cup of salt over everything. i couldn't tell what i was eating and after a few bites said  i wanted to save room for dessert.\nin all fairness, the service was excellent and the decor classy and not over done. the only thing we enjoyed was the chocolate cake with pistachio ice cream.\nwe live here and have had some very good meals at a few restaurants on the strip, but would never go to another emril restaurant. he should be embarrassed and ashamed."

            "note to vegas douchebags (all of you): when you are planning a dinner at a well known restaurant that's oozing stars and dollar signs, ed hardy is not considered dressing up. this is my splurge dinner on this vacation. i'm writing this at the table - key tones off of course, keeping it classy. i had a reservation for 9:00, got there 5 minutes early, and waited 25 minutes. not unheard of, but neither is an apology or a \"thank you for waiting.\" i also felt a little ignored as a single diner not ordering alcohol. my soda glass sat empty for a long time before i was asked if i wanted another. this happened twice, once between appetizer and main course, and once when i had a third of my steak left. no mention of whether i would be charged for refills, but either way that will be factored into the tip.  either assume that i would like it refilled and don't let it hit the table empty, or show some sort of bottle or other indication that i'll be seeing $4-5 each on the bill. i also didn't appreciate the lonely roll that was deposited on my table. just because i'm by myself doesn't mean i don't want a little basket of warm rolls to scarf down at my leisure. i was asked if i wanted another after i was done, and i declined. it was also brought out at the end of the appetizer, which indicated to me that it had been initially forgotten.  my appetizer was completely delicious. i am sad to inform you that it was a special and may not be there when you dine. it was lump crab and gnocchi. pesto, brown butter, lemon. the crab tasted like dungeness, the best of course. the gnocchi was toasty and so delicate that i could have eaten it with a spoon like ice cream.  next came the rib eye, medium, and <mark>Creamed Corn Gratine</mark>. the corn was good. the topping was crispy. the steak was definitely closer to medium well than medium. i expect a $50 steak to be flavorful and cut like butter. there were bites that i felt i was choking down. i also found it to be underseasoned. when i asked for sauces, i was given three options. bearnaise, emeril style a-1, and something muttered of which i only heard worcestershire. i think it might have been just that. i opted for the e-1. it didn't solve the seasoning issue and i found the taste odd.  the verdict is in on the diet coke. it was three dollars and i was not charged for refills. why keep asking then?  i don't see how that could be considered elevated service. i had a much better meal and experience last year at sw at the wynn. i will not be back to delmonico.", 
            "first, i want to say that it was totally cool to be able to make a reservation here via open table though yelp. it was easy and i didn't have to sign up for any additional stuff. big ups right there. i even received a confirmation email the night before (although i had already called to confirm the reservation).\n\nour server name? michael jackson. he didn't moonwalk for us but it was probably the best single display of customer service in a restaurant that i've ever had the pleasure of dining in. he was engaging, attentive, and even dropping \"kama'aina\" and a few other pidgin words upon realizing all of us were sitting there in our sig zane's (http://www.yelp.com/biz/sig-zane-designs-hilo).\n\nwe actually started with a small sampler platter that was given to us on the house because we were with our friends who lived there. i guess they like to encourage las vegas locals to come down more often. it was juicy because of the veggies on top, but the meat was a bit crisp and even more on the burnt side for me. after that we ordered the truffle oil <mark>Truffle and Parmesan Potato Chips</mark> and emeril's signature cajun <mark>Emeril's New Orleans Barbecue Shrimp</mark> appetizers. the <mark>Truffle and Parmesan Potato Chips</mark> were highly addictive and had a super rich flavor to them. add the parmesan and the saltiness was of great compliment. one of the many highlights to the evening was the shrimp appetizer. the large shrimp were wonderfully crafted with just the right amount of spices to encourage their fresh sweetness to linger.\n\ni ordered the special bone in rib eye steak. it was perfectly cooked to medium. the thing was pretty large and i finished off most of it, but coupled with everything else we ordered, it was a tall task. my good friend ordered the <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> medallions and they were spectacularly juicy and flavorful. i actually secretly wished i had ordered that instead.\n\nours sides consisted of <mark>Potato Gratin</mark>, caramelized seasonal onions, and <mark>Creamed Corn Gratine</mark>. they all were excellent in their own right. my friend described the <mark>Potato Gratin</mark> as the single best dish of <mark>Potato Gratin</mark> he has ever had. myself, i thought that the seasonal onions were spectacularly sweet. they blew my mind and i almost loaded up on those alone. the <mark>Creamed Corn Gratine</mark> was also sweet, but it wasn't as good as the other two. although, two spectacular sides out of three isn't too shabby.\n\noverall, it was a great spending time with good friends over an excellent meal in addition to the wonderful service. it was worth every expensive penny i could slam on the credit card. i would easily recommend to anyone the experience. reservations are highly recommended. one last note, we even got a hand-written thank you postcard less than a week later from michael. that was really nice.", 
            "i've watched emeril on the foodnetwork channel for years.. i even used to tape his shows through my vcr (yes vhs tapes). i have heard of this place through a friend that told me that everytime his brother goes to vegas he eats here. so, when i found out that it was emeril's restaurant, i was even more eager to try this place! well, i finally had the chance to experience this restaurant, whose owner is one of the most enthusiastic and giddy chef's around! \n\ni had made reservations a couple hours prior and when we got there we were seated within seconds. place was pretty occupied with plenty of men dressed in suits, a few couples and  loud crowds that had their drunken voices echoing throughout the restaurant. all the staff members were well postured with every movement from pouring drinks to picking up finished plates off the table. the place is contemporary, a minimalist dream with large and very comfortable dining chairs.\n\nthe order:\n\n<mark>Vine-Ripened Heirloom Tomato Salad</mark>: tomatoes were juicy, plump and tasted so fresh. the tomatoes combined with the red onion, fresh mozzarella, extra virgin olive oil and balsamic vinegar = 4.5/5 stars\n\n<mark>Lobster Bisque</mark>: wow! i've had this dish a couple other times at other fancy restaurants and this one just blew those away! the flavor of the soup was smooth and had just the right amount of lobster flavor, not rich at all. came with a few pieces of lobster.. what a tease! \n\n<mark>Potato Gratin</mark>: came in a mini pan with the whole top completely lightly crusted brown. i grabbed my fork, broke into the soft crust and scooped up bite with a little bit of everything on it (crust,  potato and cheese). one of the better potato side dishes i've ever had!\n\n<mark>Creamed Corn Gratine</mark>: also came in a mini pan with a crumble/breaded top layer. the breading went well with the corn but overall it was just good.\n\nbone in rib steak: server asked me if i wanted emeril's essence and slice of butter placed on my steak. i told him that i wanted it the way it should be served.. shortly, the steak was finally served with a thin slice of butter with the evident emeril magic dust \"bam!\" sprinkled over  the meat. it was a healthy portion and did look fantasteak! not the softest steaks i've had but had a nice chew, not the juiciest but was far from dry, overall had a very well rounded quality to it. no complaints! \n\nemeril's banana cream pie: came tall with layers whip cream, generous amount of banana slices, banana cream and thin crust. there was also chocolate sprinkled/shavings  on top and caramel spread on the bottom. a great way to finish a fine dinner! \n\n*also had a glass of some french honey wine to compliment the pie, it was on the sweeter side but worth trying.\n\nbeing a fan of emeril for years, had high expectations.. the place delivered but not with flying colors..", 
            "amazing steak, as well as some of the best service i've ever had at a restaurant.\n\nmy friends and i came here for dinner on a sunday (with a reservation, just in case), and we decided to split two steaks between 3 girls. we ehard that the portions are very generous, and we also wanted to try out the sides as well.\n\nwe ordered the bone in ribeye, along with the bone in <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> with a mushroom sauce (one of the specials of the day).  we also ordered the <mark>Truffle and Parmesan Potato Chips</mark>, as well as the <mark>Creamed Corn Gratine</mark> and the <mark>Country Smashed Potatoes</mark>.\n\nthe first thing to come out were the <mark>Truffle and Parmesan Potato Chips</mark>. sadly, for a girl who eats <mark>Truffle and Parmesan Potato Chips</mark> as her main meal frequently, i couldn't partake of them because of the parmesan (i cannot stand stinky cheese).  however, i did at least try one, and the texture of the chip (similar to a kettle chip almost), and the slight hint of truffle was amazing. however, the parmesan was still prominent, so i watched sadly while my gfs devoured the chips. i felt as if i was being punished, for some reason.\n\nluckily our steaks arrived at that point, and they were huge. it was definitely a good idea that we had decided to split two instead of each of us ordering our own.  our server (who's name i forgot), was incredibly helpful and nice. he brought over a carving table and after presenting the steaks to us, took them aside and carved them all for us.  we got our sides at that point too, and we just dug in.\n\nthe rib eye was incredibly flavorful. i tend to not normally order it because not all places will grill the ribeye properly and i end up with a slightly tough steak (even if ordered at medium). this one had just the right amount or pink, and the seasoning was mild enough so that the flavor of the meat shone through.  \n\nthe filet was also very tender.  while we were eating the filet without the mushroom demiglace, i decided to test it out.  the sauce is based on a reduction of veal stock, and it complimented the steak wonderfully. it didn't mask the taste of the meat at all but just added another dimension to it.  after urging my friends to try the sauce, we quickly started pouring spoonfuls of it over the rest of the steak on our plates.\n\nthe sides were very good as well. the creamed corn had a hint of spice due to some mined jalapenos that were in it. definitely a trick i am looking forward to trying at home.\n\nas great as the food was, i was also very impressed with the level of service. you would think that a fancy steak restaurant would be annoyed at the sharing of steaks, but they never batted an eye to our request (apparently a lot of people do this).  in addition, we never felt as if we were waiting to flag down a server whenever we needed assistance.\n\nfor everything we got, the meal itself also came out to be a lot less than i expected (although i'm sure it has to do with the sharing as well). however, we were so full and satisfied from our meal that we promptly fell asleep back in our room and decided against going out that night. that is definitely a sign of a great meal.", 
            "beyond food coma...it's food paralysis!  the itis ain't got nothin' on this.\n\ni had my preconceptions of the food here but i put them away for a short time and figured i'll try anything once.  dinner started with some bread with butter and munched on the <mark>Truffle and Parmesan Potato Chips</mark>.  they were very oily, warm, crunchy, savory, and tangy in flavor.  we did not make a dent in them.  the appetizer was soon followed by the <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> and <mark>Traditional New Orleans Gumbo</mark> with chicken and andouille sausage.  the <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> was really intense in flavor.  it had an almost bitter flavor but so rich like condensed sweet buttery lobster in sea water.\n\nthe protein that night was the <mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark> which we split.  perfectly cooked to medium, it had a nice crust on the outside and had a big glob of butter on top.  i immediately scraped the butter off and put it on the side but a lot of it had already melted onto the plate or penetrated the meat.  the meat was thick, tender, juicy, had perfect grill marks on the outside, and smelled floral due to the either rosemary or thyme sprigs.  accompanying the main dish was the <mark>Pan Seared <mark>Foie Gras</mark></mark>.  yes, i had to try the duck (or goose) liver.  it was indeed buttery, silky, melt in your mouth tender and a good sized piece at that.  like everything else here, it was seared in butter and had a salty, buttery crust to it.\n\nas for the sides, we had sauteed garlic wild mushrooms and the <mark>Creamed Corn Gratine</mark>.  the mushrooms were delightful.  i loved forking up different varieties that i had no idea what they were.  they just tasted great.  the garlicky, buttery flavor and tender yet almost slippery texture makes this dish my favorite of the night.  the creamed corn also exhibited buttery flavor so much i think it was in a bath of butter and heavy cream.\n\nyou couldn't have all this great food without wine and they have an impressive wine menu indeed.  i went with that i know and got the syrah.  toward the end of the meal it hit me.  the wall...of carbs, butter, salt, cholesterol, all in a sluggish soup coursing though my veins like molasses.  i feel my heart straining to pump the blood with heavy thumps and i feel the arteries of my wrist bumping against the table.  my body starts to get lethargic - i don't wanna move, no i can't move - as i gaze blankly over the huge leftovers of corn and butter.  this is beyond food coma, i need a blood transfusion i thought.  need i be more dramatic?  my preconceptions were right.\n\non the bright side, the service is impeccable here and everyone seems to to take their job seriously and sincerely.  it is a bit of a formal atmosphere but you don't feel like you're in las vegas for the short time you're there.", 
            "our group of 14 was staying at the venetian and delmonicos was our pick for a nice fancy dinner. since we had a night full of drinking ahead of us, we definitely didn't want to over-stuff our stomachs so each couple agreed to share a steak along with lots of appetizers and sides. \n\nto start off, some of us had the <mark><mark>Ahi Tuna</mark> and Salmon Tartare</mark>, wedged salad, baked oysters, french escargot, <mark>Creole Boiled Gulf Shrimp Cocktail</mark>, and <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark>. they were all quite tasty! \n\nthe bf and i shared a <mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark>. asked for medium rare but it came out medium well. i was disappointed since i really hate eating well done meat. luckily the flavoring itself was pretty delicious or i'd definitely have to have it recooked. i also had an addition of <mark>Pan Seared <mark>Foie Gras</mark></mark> as well - which was the absolute best part of my meal. the flavoring and texture was perfect and after my last bite, i found myself wanting more still!\n\nalong with our main entree, we had an order of almost every side they had listed on their dinner menu: <mark>Buttered Fresh Asparagus</mark>, <mark>Buttered Fresh Broccoli</mark>, <mark>Delmonico Creamed Spinach</mark>, sauteed <mark>Sauted Garlic Mushrooms</mark>, mash potatoes, <mark>Creamed Corn Gratine</mark>, and <mark>Potato Gratin</mark>. all the sides are meant to be shared family style and a scoop of each was more than plentiful to compliment your main course. i loved the creamed corn the most. \n\nas full i already was, i saw expresso creme brulee on their dessert menu so of course i couldn't pass up on that. glad i didn't either bc it was fantastic!\n\nservice was excellent and our three waiters were extremely attentive and helpful throughout our entire meal. overall, we had a pleasant dining experience. \n\n3.5 stars because my steak came out medium well instead of medium rare, but because the service was superb, 4 stars it is! next time, get my steak right please =)", 
            "yes yes yes! i'm probably repeating all the great things people said already but it is true. my husband and i were there this past weekend and we were satisfied 100%! and after reading the reviews i'm not sure why people minus the 5th star because of the price. in my opinion if you are looking for an amazing fine dining experience you must be wiling to spend the money. we were here for about three hours and we enjoyed every bit of it. we let our waiter know in advance that we were in no rush and he made sure to plan the timing of our appetizers and main just right. we were watching the blue man group after dinner and wanted to drink a few drinks before we left.\n\nevery time we went to the bathroom they folded our napkins, refilled our drinks before we even had time to ask, and our waiter was extremely knowledgeable about the menu --- that alone just shows the attention to detail. in addition to the <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark>, french escargot, cream <mark>Creamed Corn Gratine</mark>, creole gulf shirmp cocktail...:) i had the hot <mark>Alaskan Red King Crab Legs</mark> and my husband had the bone in ribeye. he said \"it is the best steak he has ever had\" ( please take in consideration that we had travel all over the world).  the noise was moderate, besides i'm in vegas and i wanted to dine in a lively and happy place not a quiet boring place.  even though the dining room was open it is still cozy and romantic and easy to have a private conversation.  \n\nit has become one of our favorite places to go and we will definitely come back again!", 
            "emeril's delmonico steakhouse is located in the venetian hotel, slightly across from the blue man group theatre. to be honest, i even liked chef emeril much. never cared about his shows or his cooking. guess he made me a believer after this one night dining at delmonico. we made reservations through open table for a party of 12 on a saturday night. we wanted 6:30pm but were only given the options of 5pm or 9pm (fyi, reservations were made about two weeks in advance). we weren't about to pig out then hit the night life scene all bloated and passing gas so we settled for 5pm which worked out anyways. gave us plenty of time to digest and chill. \n\nwe checked in with the three pretty hostesses and were offered to have a seat in their lounge area until our table was ready. barely five minutes passed and our ma\\u00eetre d' came out to fetch us. unfortunately, he wasn't as easy on the eyes as the hostess. however, he took care of us the entire night. i apologize for not remembering his name because he's worth mentioning and deserve recognition: caucasian, arrogant looking but very proper and attentive, and had a dark humor side to him. \n\nthe establishment is quite simple but still very classy. it's dimly lit for you romantic types; unfortunately this was a bromance between 12 obnoxious dudes. the dining rooms and distance between tables were spacious enough so you're able to have some sort of privacy. you can tell that they didn't try to over do the interior design of the place. it's an elegant and clean look.\n\nwe all decided to bypass appetizers and drinks and just went straight for the entrees and side dishes. we figured we'll be pounding enough booze later on the night. after recently having some awesome buffalo in wyoming, i decided to order the three peppercorn crusted american buffalo rib-eye with caramelized cipollini onions and brandy peppercorn reduction ($50). for those of you who are already raising an eyebrow, this chunk of meat was by far gamey. it well cooked, very tender, and seemed to have less fat that then regular bone in rib eye. personally, medium rare is the way to go. i sampled the bone in rib eye from my friend's plate and i have to say that the buffalo is the unanimous winner. a few of the other guys who are traditional beef carnivores decided to try the buffalo also agreed that the buffalo was well worth the try. not to dock the rib eye because that was still very legit.\n\nfor sides, we ordered two of the following to share: saut\\u00e9ed garlic wild mushrooms ($11), new orleans <mark>Delmonico Creamed Spinach</mark> ($9), and the <mark>Creamed Corn Gratine</mark> ($11). it was the perfect amount of sides for the entire table, not over killing it yet a decent amount for each person. all sides were very delish and complimented our meals perfectly.\n\neverything could not have gone smoother. the 12 of us had a nice corner to ourselves. service was top notch. occasionally, they brought out 4-5 servers at once to present all the entrees to us all at the same time. our drinks never ran dry and we were always checked up on every so often. the chef even sent out a sampling which was ground duck rice ball in a sweet and sour sauce. that could've easily been an appetizer order all together and we would've happily ordered it. even the pricing was quite affordable considering the caliber of the steak house delmonico is. i am quite impressed with what chef emeril has done with this restaurant. big props to him and the entire staff for an outstanding meal. i do look forward to future visits.", 
            "there's a reason why emeril lagasse is such a celebrated chef. his restaurant, delmonico steakhouse, provided impeccable service and outstanding food.\n\ndelmonico steakhouse was our big dinner out in vegas for a bachelorette weekend. 9 of us were promptly seated for our 7:30pm sunday reservation. i ordered a glass of malbec (my favorite, which is rather had to find).\n\nas a table, we shared the bbq shrimp (which was just the right hit of smokey and sweet), truffle and parm <mark>Truffle and Parmesan Potato Chips</mark> (uberly addictive) and the lettuce wedge salad.\n\nfor my entr\\u00e9e, i decided to get the bone in ribeye-the house specialty. it did not disappoint. it was quite a large piece of steak, but it didn't stop me from finishing all of it (that's not something i do very often). we split the <mark>Delmonico Creamed Spinach</mark> and the <mark>Creamed Corn Gratine</mark>. the spinach was average but the creamed corn was vegetable candy. \n\nwe ended our meal with emeril's infamous banana cream pie. holy moly. sky high pie packed with bananas, caramel sauce, chocolate shavings, and whipped cream. even though we were all full, we couldn't help but finish it.\n\nour waiter was extremely attentive. service, overall, was phenomenal. when our steaks were ready, there was a server for each plate so we were presented our dishes at the same exact moment. now that's service.\n\nit goes without saying that this was pricey, even for vegas standards, but you get what you pay for. \n\ni highly recommend checking out delmonico at least once.", 
            "i had the pleasure of dining at this restaurant while i was visiting vegas with my fiance. we were staying at the venetian and this location is conveniently located within the beautiful hotel so it was an easy choice for dinner. it is definitely nice not having to step outside of the ac when the average temperature outside is 115! \n\ni got the <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> to start and <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> for the main dish. some of the side items we got were spinach, asparagus, wild mushrooms, and <mark>Creamed Corn Gratine</mark>. the main dishes do not come with sides so they are extra but the portions are large enough to share. \n\ni asked for my <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> to be medium rare and it was done perfectly. the steak was so tender and delicious! it was definitely one of the best steaks i have had. the sides complimented the meat nicely and everything single one of them were delicious. i wish i could comment on their deserts but we were both so full by the end of the meal that we decided to skip desert. this restaurant is a must if you are in vegas!",

            "delmonico in las vegas by emeril lagasse is not as impressive as i would expect it would be. first we are given a really lousy table in the corner as if my husband has been very bad that he deserve to be punished in the corner(considering this is his special day-b-day). waiters are clueless, they are just standing in the middle but most of the time really doing nothing that in few ocassions i have to pour my own wine in my glass. the head waiter is the only one who seems to be working and who do know what to do here.\n            we are given a small apetizer courtesy of the chef bec of my husbands b-day which is a good touch, i love this little appetizer (not in the menu, wish it was there because that would be the only highlight of the evening) a concoction of smoke chicken with couscous with a little spices, the taste is all balance and in harmony.\n           the fried green tomatoes appetizer is bland, whatever coating and sauce they put in there didnt help at all.  the spinach and raddichio salad is soaked on its own dressing which you cannot even tell which dressing it is, salads when presented are supposed to be crisp, so make sure you only put the dressing when it is ready to be eaten, very disappointing since the head weater gladly recommended this dish.\n          my husband ordered bone in ribeye steak, huge, cooked perfect but no taste or seasoning at all, it would need some sort of sauce to make it appetizing.  <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> is ok, just like any other <mark>Filet Mignon</mark>, nothing great about it.\n         luckily there's one dish that is worth mentioning, the <mark>Potato Gratin</mark> dauphineous, excellent, potato perfectly cooked, not much cream, hint of garlic and toasty top, excellent!\n        going back? no way, very expensive and i'm not happy.", 
            "five star food. the service? not so much. \n\nwhile in vegas, my boyfriend and i decided it was time to splurge a bit and eat some tasty, tasty cow. we were seeing blue man group that night, and this place was located right next to the theatre. and it's an emeril restaurant. awesome, right?\n\nwe were seated promptly for our 830 reservation. i sat down and the guy put my napkin on my lap and stepped on my foot in the process. no big deal; i'm a klutz too. shortly thereafter, a waiter appeared, informed us that we'd have three servers that night. he then asked us if we'd like bottled or tap water, and then asked if we wanted a wine list. we answered and he went off to take care of it. not 30 seconds later someone else (one of our other servers, i assume) showed up and gave us the exact same spiel. we answered the same way. \n\nsoon after, the first guy appeared with the wine list, which was literally 25 pages long. ok, i both love me some wine and understand that this is a nice place, but a wine list that long is overwhelming. yes, they had a page with kevin's (the sommelier, i assume) picks, but still. \n\n20 minutes after we received the wine list, our server finally showed up to take our wine and food orders. we decided to split a ribeye and some <mark>Potato Gratin</mark>. i also got the gumbo, which was served promptly along with our wine. \n\nas i said before, everything was delicious. the wine was great, the gumbo was extremely flavorful, the ribeye was tender and wonderful, and i also loved the <mark>Potato Gratin</mark>. however, when we got our food, i asked the server if he could give us the check a little early so we wouldn't have to rush to make our show (we were cutting it close, especially with the time it took for the server to come take our order). he insisted we'd have plenty of time and refused to give us the check. this is because he wanted to offer us dessert after our meal. fine. whatever. still annoying. \n\ni'm hoping that this was just an off night, because it seems that most of the reviews here are very complimentary of the service. i'd be willing to give this place another shot, because the food was really that good (and actually kind of reasonably priced for what you get if you split a steak like we did). \n\nso, we'll see...", 
            "the bf and i went on a trip to vegas and decided to try delmonico steakhouse since i like emeril on the food network & had yet to eat at one of his restaurants. i would just like to say...service, service, service... the servers here are phenomenal. their recommendations were exactly what we were looking for and didn't know we wanted. about 1-2 week after our meal there, our waiter sent us a personalized and hand signed card to our house thanking us for our patronage and hoping to see us again. neither of us had had that happen before and haven't seen it since. \n\nto start, i had the <mark>Organic Baby Mixed Greens Salad</mark> with creole spiced croutons, sherry vinaigrette, shaved manchego cheese, teardrop tomatoes and red onion. i have been attempting to recreate this salad and dressing at home since we ate there. i then had the filet (i like to compare them from place to place), and it was delicious, so tender, and had a fantastic seared crust that gave it plenty of flavor. i also had the <mark>Potato Gratin</mark> and asparagus, which were both scrumptious. while this was an expensive meal, it was certainly a highlight to our trip to vegas.", 
            "first, i want to say that it was totally cool to be able to make a reservation here via open table though yelp. it was easy and i didn't have to sign up for any additional stuff. big ups right there. i even received a confirmation email the night before (although i had already called to confirm the reservation).\n\nour server name? michael jackson. he didn't moonwalk for us but it was probably the best single display of customer service in a restaurant that i've ever had the pleasure of dining in. he was engaging, attentive, and even dropping \"kama'aina\" and a few other pidgin words upon realizing all of us were sitting there in our sig zane's (http://www.yelp.com/biz/sig-zane-designs-hilo).\n\nwe actually started with a small sampler platter that was given to us on the house because we were with our friends who lived there. i guess they like to encourage las vegas locals to come down more often. it was juicy because of the veggies on top, but the meat was a bit crisp and even more on the burnt side for me. after that we ordered the truffle oil <mark>Truffle and Parmesan Potato Chips</mark> and emeril's signature cajun <mark>Emeril's New Orleans Barbecue Shrimp</mark> appetizers. the <mark>Truffle and Parmesan Potato Chips</mark> were highly addictive and had a super rich flavor to them. add the parmesan and the saltiness was of great compliment. one of the many highlights to the evening was the shrimp appetizer. the large shrimp were wonderfully crafted with just the right amount of spices to encourage their fresh sweetness to linger.\n\ni ordered the special bone in rib eye steak. it was perfectly cooked to medium. the thing was pretty large and i finished off most of it, but coupled with everything else we ordered, it was a tall task. my good friend ordered the <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> medallions and they were spectacularly juicy and flavorful. i actually secretly wished i had ordered that instead.\n\nours sides consisted of <mark>Potato Gratin</mark>, caramelized seasonal onions, and <mark>Creamed Corn Gratine</mark>. they all were excellent in their own right. my friend described the <mark>Potato Gratin</mark> as the single best dish of <mark>Potato Gratin</mark> he has ever had. myself, i thought that the seasonal onions were spectacularly sweet. they blew my mind and i almost loaded up on those alone. the <mark>Creamed Corn Gratine</mark> was also sweet, but it wasn't as good as the other two. although, two spectacular sides out of three isn't too shabby.\n\noverall, it was a great spending time with good friends over an excellent meal in addition to the wonderful service. it was worth every expensive penny i could slam on the credit card. i would easily recommend to anyone the experience. reservations are highly recommended. one last note, we even got a hand-written thank you postcard less than a week later from michael. that was really nice.", 
            "hands down best steak (ribeye) i've ever ever had. nice seasoning and aged steak. try garlic sauteed wild mushrooms and <mark>Potato Gratin</mark>. yummy. wish i was eating it right now.. drool...", 
            "i've watched emeril on the foodnetwork channel for years.. i even used to tape his shows through my vcr (yes vhs tapes). i have heard of this place through a friend that told me that everytime his brother goes to vegas he eats here. so, when i found out that it was emeril's restaurant, i was even more eager to try this place! well, i finally had the chance to experience this restaurant, whose owner is one of the most enthusiastic and giddy chef's around! \n\ni had made reservations a couple hours prior and when we got there we were seated within seconds. place was pretty occupied with plenty of men dressed in suits, a few couples and  loud crowds that had their drunken voices echoing throughout the restaurant. all the staff members were well postured with every movement from pouring drinks to picking up finished plates off the table. the place is contemporary, a minimalist dream with large and very comfortable dining chairs.\n\nthe order:\n\n<mark>Vine-Ripened Heirloom Tomato Salad</mark>: tomatoes were juicy, plump and tasted so fresh. the tomatoes combined with the red onion, fresh mozzarella, extra virgin olive oil and balsamic vinegar = 4.5/5 stars\n\n<mark>Lobster Bisque</mark>: wow! i've had this dish a couple other times at other fancy restaurants and this one just blew those away! the flavor of the soup was smooth and had just the right amount of lobster flavor, not rich at all. came with a few pieces of lobster.. what a tease! \n\n<mark>Potato Gratin</mark>: came in a mini pan with the whole top completely lightly crusted brown. i grabbed my fork, broke into the soft crust and scooped up bite with a little bit of everything on it (crust,  potato and cheese). one of the better potato side dishes i've ever had!\n\n<mark>Creamed Corn Gratine</mark>: also came in a mini pan with a crumble/breaded top layer. the breading went well with the corn but overall it was just good.\n\nbone in rib steak: server asked me if i wanted emeril's essence and slice of butter placed on my steak. i told him that i wanted it the way it should be served.. shortly, the steak was finally served with a thin slice of butter with the evident emeril magic dust \"bam!\" sprinkled over  the meat. it was a healthy portion and did look fantasteak! not the softest steaks i've had but had a nice chew, not the juiciest but was far from dry, overall had a very well rounded quality to it. no complaints! \n\nemeril's banana cream pie: came tall with layers whip cream, generous amount of banana slices, banana cream and thin crust. there was also chocolate sprinkled/shavings  on top and caramel spread on the bottom. a great way to finish a fine dinner! \n\n*also had a glass of some french honey wine to compliment the pie, it was on the sweeter side but worth trying.\n\nbeing a fan of emeril for years, had high expectations.. the place delivered but not with flying colors..", 
            "i usually love delmonicos but my last trip kept me wanting more. maybe i was too hungover to thoroughly enjoy my meal, but on this blurry saturday night everything was very mediocre for me. we started off with the <mark>Classic Steak Tartare</mark> and the bbq shrimp. the <mark>Classic Steak Tartare</mark> was very good. it was fresh, clean and delicious. the bbq shrimp was good, but for $18 for 4 shrimps, i wanted them to be a party in my mouth, and in this case, they were not. i ordered a medium rare rib eye. it was cooked to absolute perfection. nice crust and juicy pink center. i marveled at the perfection of my steak. although it was slightly under seasoned it was still juicy and delicious.\n\ndelmonico's is probably one of the best if not thee best steakhouses i've been to. their service is spectacular and on point every time i've been. they really do hire the best of the best. attentive but not overbearing servers.  delmonicos puts out some amazing and good quality food. if you go, you must try their <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark>, it's luscious, creamy and definitely worth the calories. <mark>Potato Gratin</mark> is definitely one of their best sides also. and of course, don't every steer from what you came for, the steak!\n\nemeril, you slightly let me down this time, but i still remember how good you've been to me the last times. i'll be back to let you redeem yourself.", 
            "given the big name attached to this place (emeril), and based on a friend's recommendation, i had high hopes. sadly, the name here is just a facade for mediocre food and service.\n\ni made reservations via yelp/opentable to treat my girl to a nice dinner on our first \"just us\" trip to las vegas.\n\nit was a cold night and she had decided to wear a heavy coat. when we arrived, neither the host or hostess offered to take her coat. i then asked them to take her coat and they responded that delmonico's doesn't offer a coat check. strike one.\n\nthe hostess seated us at a table that had obviously already been reserved for us, as two of the chairs at the four-person table had been removed. that was a small, but nice touch.\n\ni had expected delmonico's to have a dress code, but there were plenty of patrons in jeans and polo shirts. i almost want to strike the restaurant for that, but i understand it is vegas and they have to cater to a variety of customers. but it does take the ambiance down a notch.\n\nthe waiter appeared promptly and introduced himself (renee, i believe it was). i had to ask for the wine list. why should i have to *ask* for the wine list? strike two.\n\nrenee did not go over any of the specials with us. he also mentioned that two other servers would be assisting them, but he did so when they weren't there. so when one of them came by later, we had no idea which of the two assistants he was.\n\nthe assistant pretty much took over at that point, and we only saw renee once again (with the bill). the assistant asked to take our order before we even saw the wine list.\n\nthis wasn't turning out to be the pampered, high-quality service that i had come to expect based on my experiences at other fine dining establishments.\n\nour food came out fairly quickly; almost too quickly. we had barely received the wine when our appetizers arrived. she had the <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> which was very thin and only contained about 1oz of lobster. i had the duck prosciutto flatbread. the duck was overcooked and still had a layer of skin and fat that was rubbery.\n\nalmost instantly after we finished our appetizers, the main entrees arrived as if they had been waiting around the corner with the dishes to spring out as we took the last bites of our appetizers.\n\nshe ordered the filet and i had the bone-in rib-eye. both of the cuts were of good quality but were ruined by an over-seasoning of creole spices. both steaks were ordered medium rare and came out cooked perfectly.\n\nthe sides left much to be desired. many of the choices were bland and uninspiring. the broccoli was simply steamed with no seasoning or oils added. the <mark>Potato Gratin</mark> contained too much garlic.\n\nthe speed of the service and delivery of the meal was too fast. we finished dinner within 1 hour. strike three.\n\ntotal damage, including wine ($120 for the bottle) and tip, came to ~$340. we've had much, much better fine dining experiences (and food) for less.\n\ni would not recommend this place to anyone looking for a classy, upscale meal. it's just a touristy, over-priced restaurant with a celebrity chef's name tied to it.\n\nthere are many better options available in vegas.", 
            "we had early reservations for a party of 9 for my 40th birthday. we were seated at a lovely table and were all surprised how we could hear everyone without having to strain. this means the acoustics in the room we were in were spot on. \n\nour waiter was lamont and there were various other folks helping us out. we were all served warm buttery rolls that had both a salt and we are pretty sure bit of sugar sprinkling on them. drinks were ordered by a few of us-i imbibed just a bit as it was my birthday after all and the drinks were good, reasonably priced and tasty. \n\neverything we ate was wonderful. we started with 2 orders of house made <mark>Truffle and Parmesan Potato Chips</mark> with truffle oil and parmesan. they were yummy and the perfect combination of salt and grease to help the booze go down easily. some of us had starters, some of us chose not to. \n\ni had the <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> to start and it was heavenly with perfectly cooked lobster and nice pieces of it. others had the gumbo (no seafood-heat but not hot), the heirloom tomato and burrata cheese salad. there were also a couple of other appetizers ordered-bbq shrimp (delicious and unlike anything we had before) and escargot(i was too chicken to try it).\n<mark>Truffle and Parmesan Potato Chips</mark>\n\nfor mains, people had \nfilets\nbone in rib-eye \nsalmon\nscallops\nmedallions of beef\n\nsince sides are generous, we all shared:\nasparagus\ncreamed corn-delicious (and i make my own just as good)\n<mark>Delmonico Creamed Spinach</mark> (the most boring)\nsauteed mushrooms-fabulous\n<mark>Potato Gratin</mark>\ntwice <mark>Baked Idaho Potato</mark>\ngrits (meh-but not for me texturally)\n\nwe were all so full, we only ordered one dessert to share and that was the infamous banana cream pie. worth every bite and every calorie-in fact....\n\nkevin and i came back here for lunch our last day in vegas!\nwe shared the bbq shrimp, i had the <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> again and he had the <mark>Vine-Ripened Heirloom Tomato Salad</mark>. we also shared another slice of the banana cream pie and i would do it again in a heartbeat. \n\nfabulous birthday dinner and wonderful company!", 
            "our group of 14 was staying at the venetian and delmonicos was our pick for a nice fancy dinner. since we had a night full of drinking ahead of us, we definitely didn't want to over-stuff our stomachs so each couple agreed to share a steak along with lots of appetizers and sides. \n\nto start off, some of us had the <mark><mark>Ahi Tuna</mark> and Salmon Tartare</mark>, wedged salad, baked oysters, french escargot, <mark>Creole Boiled Gulf Shrimp Cocktail</mark>, and <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark>. they were all quite tasty! \n\nthe bf and i shared a <mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark>. asked for medium rare but it came out medium well. i was disappointed since i really hate eating well done meat. luckily the flavoring itself was pretty delicious or i'd definitely have to have it recooked. i also had an addition of <mark>Pan Seared <mark>Foie Gras</mark></mark> as well - which was the absolute best part of my meal. the flavoring and texture was perfect and after my last bite, i found myself wanting more still!\n\nalong with our main entree, we had an order of almost every side they had listed on their dinner menu: <mark>Buttered Fresh Asparagus</mark>, <mark>Buttered Fresh Broccoli</mark>, <mark>Delmonico Creamed Spinach</mark>, sauteed <mark>Sauted Garlic Mushrooms</mark>, mash potatoes, <mark>Creamed Corn Gratine</mark>, and <mark>Potato Gratin</mark>. all the sides are meant to be shared family style and a scoop of each was more than plentiful to compliment your main course. i loved the creamed corn the most. \n\nas full i already was, i saw expresso creme brulee on their dessert menu so of course i couldn't pass up on that. glad i didn't either bc it was fantastic!\n\nservice was excellent and our three waiters were extremely attentive and helpful throughout our entire meal. overall, we had a pleasant dining experience. \n\n3.5 stars because my steak came out medium well instead of medium rare, but because the service was superb, 4 stars it is! next time, get my steak right please =)", 
            "wow, what a huge disappointment, considering how expensive the entrees are!\n\nmy girlfriends and i were totally famished when we got into vegas, thank goodness we had made reservations beforehand. we didn't wait long and had a drink in the lounge as we waited to be seated.\n\nafter browsing the menu, my friend and i decided to split the <mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark>, medium well. our server says it's their house specialty. the steak was completely blackened from the char and the inside was perfectly done. as i cut into it with my knife, i can tell it's going to be chewy....and indeed it was. it had almost no flavor for a dry aged meat. my friend had to ask for steak sauce and sour cream to make it more flavorful.\n\nbut, the sides we ordered (<mark>Potato Gratin</mark> and creamed corn) were awesome! and my friend's <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> was the most tender i've ever had (she gave me some of hers)\n\nthe service was impeccable and friendly...but the food (at least what i ate) was not worth $52 for a steak.", 
            "i've never had a meal experience like what i had at delmonico's. me and a buddy were in vegas for the first time and decided we wanted to go out for a good steak dinner. i asked for recommendations from people and settled on delmonico's. i made reservations the monday before the thursday we went to dinner. i checked out the menu ahead of time and was not surprised to see the pretty high prices., i was confident though that we were gonna get what we paid for. \nwe arrived about 45 minutes before the reservation time and had a couple beers in the lounge. $6 for a bud light was pretty reasonable for this atmosphere. we were seated promptly at 7 and that's where things got impressive. the dining area is secluded, you have no idea you are in a casino, which is great. we were greeted by one of our 3 waiters and offered the wine menu. neither of us drink wine, but i could tell the selection was awesome. \nwe ordered the <mark>Truffle and Parmesan Potato Chips</mark> and bowls of the gumbo. both were excellent, emeril knows gumbo. i ordered the <mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark> and my buddy got the filet. we also got the <mark>Potato Gratin</mark> and a twice <mark>Baked Idaho Potato</mark>. the sides are ala carte and family style. they were some of the best potatoes we had ever had. as for the steaks, they were both the greatest steaks we had ever had! no sauce is necessary for these babies. after dinner i had the banana cream pie, which was exceptional. my buddy had the cheesecake and said it was awesome. \noverall i can not speak highly enough of the dining experie nce at delmonico's. the professional staff, excellent atmosphere, and amazing food make delmonico's a place i will go to again.", 
            "the bone-in rib eye is easily the highlight of this steakhouse. the medium rare steak had excellent flavor along with the marbled fat that simply melted in my mouth. the oysters, <mark>Ahi Tuna</mark> & <mark><mark>Ahi Tuna</mark> and Salmon Tartare</mark>, <mark>Butternut Squash Ravioli</mark>, and bbq shrimp are all excellent choices for starters and the <mark>Potato Gratin</mark> is a good side dish to have the steak with. the wine list is very extensive, but if you're not up for all that intensive reading, they also have a very knowledgeable staff to make recommendations. i was a little disappointed with peppermint profiteroles which were a little too stiff for my liking. service was great and efficient. i must have had my water glass filled 7-8 times that night. pricing is relatively decent - entrees around $50 and starters/sides/deserts around $10-$15 each.", 
            "i had dinner here on 2/7.  the last time i was here was over 10 years ago.  the last vegas steakhouse that i had eaten at was cut, so that is what i will be comparing my experience to.\nservice:  very good.  we had at least 3-4 servers taking care of us (party of 5) throughout the night.  initially dinner was for a party of 4.  however, once we were seated, our buddy landed at the airport and decided to join us.  i informed the head server (thinking that they may not be able to accommodate) and he immediately converted the table to seat 5 (pulled out stuff from the bottom to make it a round table).  water was constantly filled and table cleared off in appropriate fashion.\nfood:  we started off with the <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> and <mark>Ahi Tuna</mark>/<mark><mark>Ahi Tuna</mark> and Salmon Tartare</mark>.  i thought the salad was just ok.  a tad too much dressing.  same with the tartare.  nothing special and pretty bland.  most of the group got the bone in rib eye (medium rare to medium well).  all were cooked well.  i thought the medium rare tasty pretty good.  nothing spectacular about it, just good steak.  i had the <mark>Colorado Rack of Lamb</mark> (medium rare) and it had decent flavors.  i would take carvino's lamb chops over it any day.  the sides we had were decent (<mark>Potato Gratin</mark>, mushrooms, and corn).  we had a nice bottle of wine that the sommelier recommended with a price point of $85.  that was probably the best tasting thing of the night.\nthe verdict on delmonico's is that it is a decent steakhouse that it's reputation is based on its name more than its food.  i would choose cut over it any day.  they have more selection of meat (cuts and quality).", 
            "dined there last weekend with some friends and we were utterly disappointed. not impressed one bit.\ni don't understand how this restaurant received such high ratings, but i certainly would not go back nor would i recommend to anyone.\nfrom the food, the service, the ambiance - huge let down.\n\ni would've given this place an additional star if the service wasn't so terrible.  the server was slow and was more interested in chatting.  also, we waited at least 30 min to get our entrees(they didn't even seem busy). \nafter our table was cleared from apps and salads, we waited 20+ min before calling our server to check up on our food. she said it was still within the \"window\" and she couldn't do anything. luckily, she spoke to her manager after another 5-10 min because that's when our food was \"officially late.\" \n\nwhat we had (from what i can recall):\nbbq shrimp - shrimps were cooked unevenly and drowned in mediocre bbq sauce. some were cooked well, but mine was under. \n<mark>Vine-Ripened Heirloom Tomato Salad</mark> - nothing special\nbaked crab stuffed lobster - <mark>Roasted Maine Lobster Tail</mark> cooked well, but tough to eat and nothing amazing\nny strip - no flavor\nfilet - nice crust from the essence stuff\nsauteed <mark>Sauted Garlic Mushrooms</mark> - standard\n<mark>Potato Gratin</mark> - bit on the dry side\ncreamed corn gratin - best side order we had on the table, but that doesn't mean much.\n\ndessert:\nsorbet, banana cream pie, apple fritters, key lime pie.\nthe desserts and our bottle of wine were probably the highlight of this dinner.\n\nif you are looking for a good steakhouse on the strip, this is not the place.\nyou'll probably have better luck at mastro's, stripsteak, prime, or craftsteak.", 
            "i was a bit skeptical as usual to try a tv chef place, such as emeril. but i wasn't disappointed after all. we started the evening with a pre drink at the bar which is a small but nice and up scale place. then we both ordered starter and main course. i had the oyster platter and my friend and the shrimp bbq. the oyster were great, especially because it is the small size ones, more flavorful to me. i think the big hit was the shrimp which takes about 12 hours to make that special bbq sauce. then we were recommended to try to the bone in ribeye as far as steak. we were going there for steaks to start with but this was definitely a hit. steak was perfectly cooked, dry aged (8 weeks i think) and we had a lovely <mark>Potato Gratin</mark> to complement that. i wasn't a big fan of the corn side dish we ordered though. the waiter also suggested a nice red wine to complement that. service was top notch with 3-4 servers always around you which is very appreciable. if you are in a mood for steak, i think this is one of the best option in vegas for sure.", 
            "delmonico steakhouse is at the venetian.\n\nafter the venetian lost my luggage last summer (see my venetian reviews for the entire story) i swore i wouldn't step foot in the venetian. it pains me to admit this, but i stepped foot in the venetian during my most recent vegas trip :(  just to clarify, this was not by choice, but by circumstance. me, my boyfriend, and 2 other couples wanted to do a nice dinner. long story short, one of the other couples raved about this restaurant and made dinner reservations for all of us. \n\nwith that being said, this steakhouse blew me away. it was surprisingly really good.  \n\n**appetizers: i had the <mark>French Onion Soup</mark> and my boyfriend had a salad. the appetizers were so-so. we definitely could've have done without ordering them since our entrees and sides were filling.\n\n**entrees: my boyfriend and i each ordered the bone in ribeye. had we known how huge they were, we would've just ordered one and shared. i was surprised at how good my steak was. i wanted to pull a \"fred flinstone\" and pick up the steak with my hands and gnaw on the entire thing.  my steak was prepared well, seasoned well, and tasted delicious. even with all that deliciousness there was just so much meat that neither of us finished our steaks. \n\n**sides: we had the creamed corn gratin & <mark>Potato Gratin</mark>. both of which were creamy and delicious.  \n\nthe service was fine, the ambiance was nice, the steak and sides were fantastic. i'm just annoyed that this restaurant is located in the venetian -_-", 
            "phenomenal! food, staff and ambiance is impeccable! we had the filet, ham chop, cream corn and the <mark>Potato Gratin</mark>. i recommend them all! the banana cream pie was too die for and the special dessert was a brownie trifle with ice cream and marshmallow fluff, i ate until i was almost sick it was so great! come here with an appetite and you won't be disappointed!", 
            "great experience. we had a couple of friends in town and this place came highly recommended. the cherry martini is so good! i could eat a bowl of the liquor soaked cherries they put in it! we had the bbq shrimp, <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark>, and the bacon for appetizers! we ate those too quickly to get pics! the guys got rib eyes. ladies got fillet both were stellar! the ribeye had more flavor! the sides we got we're all great. asparagus, twice <mark>Baked Idaho Potato</mark>, creamed corn, and <mark>Potato Gratin</mark>. for dessert, banana cream pie and pineapple upside down cake. our bill before tip was over $400 but well worth every penny!", 
            "oh good lawwwwd....did someone say steakkk?!?!\n\ni recently came to vegas from dc for a bachelor party and this was our one \"nice\" meal for the weekend. i decided to eat the wagyu and it came with mashed sweet potato. it was sooo good. cooked awesomely by the chef. what made it even better was eating it with the many sides we ordered. surprisingly i loved the cream of spinach, but my favorite side was the <mark>Potato Gratin</mark>. unfortunately there are so many different places to eat in vegas...i don't know if i'll ever get to come back here.\n\ndef need to try it at least once!", 
            "this time, for dinner, emeril's employees took it up a notch, and diane and i enjoyed a five-star dining experience here.  we were initially served an amuse bouche of bruschetta, tomato, mozzarella, & balsamic followed by an ordered starter of <mark>Emeril's New Orleans Barbecue Shrimp</mark> that came with a light petite rosemary buttermilk biscuit and strong, heavy bbq sauce.\n\nwhile diane enjoyed a bowl of <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> with maine lobster garnish, i savored the vibrant contrasting flavors of <mark>Traditional New Orleans Gumbo</mark> with shrimp & andouille sausage.  then it was time for our mains.\n\nwhile diane worked on a petite filet without char, i applied myself to a 9-ounce lightly charred <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> cooked perfectly medium rare as ordered, with a large pat of maitre d' butter melting slowly over the top.  both steaks came with classic yorkshire pudding, which tasted best after being rubbed in meat juices that ran slightly on the plate.  the meat melted in the mouth, aided by dipping in either a quite tasty homemade worcestershire sauce or drinkable b\\u00e9arnaise sauce.  i also topped my towering rectangle of beef with a side of sauteed garlic wild mushrooms, which included multiple varieties.  we also shared a large side of very cheesy and crusty <mark>Potato Gratin</mark>.\n\nfor dessert, for us there was no choice.  it was foreordained.  no one makes banana cream pie better than emeril lagasse!  one slice of emeril's banana cream pie was easily enough for both me and my spouse to share.  together we delighted in this rich confection of ripe banana chunks set in layers like a brick wall with sweet cement, and adorned with chocolate shavings, whipped cream, and caramel sauce.  mellow decaffeinated arabica coffee served in a french press just further enhanced the end of this fine meal.  seating was very comfortable in a half-booth, and service was both professional and knowledgeable. \n\nwe will surely return for more of the same!", 
            "prior to our trip, a few of us wanted to do a steak dinner in vegas and we agreed on delmonicos. delving into the menu so i had an idea in mind of what i would be ordering, i became intrigued immensely when i saw that it was under emeril's.\n\nwe were fortunate to be seated a little early. the ambiance of course evokes an intimate and formal setting with the dim lighting. the decor was minimal and i felt there could have used some art pieces.\n\nlet me say the service was top-notch. although it is what you'd expect from such an establishment, very few places achieve such high marks imo.\nthe water glasses were never empty and it felt like we didn't really have a server but a rotation of different people that comprised the waitstaff. i counted at least 6 different people between taking our order, serving the appetizers, the main course, side dishes, wine, filling the waters and dessert. \n\nappetizer: <mark>Ahi Tuna</mark> & <mark><mark>Ahi Tuna</mark> and Salmon Tartare</mark>: superb. i liked how the cucumber salad complemented the tuna & salmon and came in a spiraled form. the wonton chips were crispy and a nice form used for stacking the tartare & salad on. the wasabi provided a nice bite and offered a different note with the tartare. \n\nmain course: ribeye (no-bone). some say the meat tastes better on the bone. in this case i found the ribeye to be succulent, juicy well seasoned and cooked to perfection. frankly i don't think it would have made much of difference if it was on the bone or not based on the flavor. adding on the butter on top was a nice feature to the steak. \n\nsides: all the sides were delicious and was about the right amount to share for 3 (4 if the people aren't big eaters. \n\n<mark>Potato Gratin</mark>: so good i couldn't stop eating it. \n\n<mark>Delmonico Creamed Spinach</mark>: no joke and the right balance of cream to tone down the strong taste of spinach was harmonic. \n\nasparagus: i'm not an asparagus fan but if asparagus always tasted this good, it might crack my top 3 favorite vegetables. had the right amount of salt and seasoning to create a more palatable asparagus. \n\ndessert: sorbet; 3 scoops, 3 flavors. strawberry, banana and the 3rd resembled coconut. i found the sorbet to be a more suitable and lighter offering vs. if it was an ice cream or gelato.\nclean flavors and the banana was surprisingly interesting given the fact its not something one often comes across."

            "absolutely loved everything about this place.  my party of 6 chose this establishment to have our new year's eve dinner and the restaurant did not disappoint.  we were 20 minutes late for our 8:30pm reservation since we were stuck trying to squeeze through the nye crowd from 2 hotels down.  the host didn't think anything of it and was able to seat us right away.\n\ni had ordered the <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> and shared the side of the perfectly steamed and <mark>Buttered Fresh Asparagus</mark> that could serve up to 4 people.  i ordered my filet medium rare and it was definitely medium rare as our helpful and attentive waiter, ryan, had described it.  the other dishes my dining companions had were the pepper-seared <mark>Ahi Tuna</mark>, grilled petite beef medallions, and spicy jumbo shrimp with fresh fettucine pasta.  all of which they loved.  \n\nthe dessert lovers shared the warm apple crisp and the chocolate brioche bread pudding.  it was the first chocolate bread pudding i had and once i dug into the soft center, i fell in love....\n\nat the end of dinner, not having a calculator, ryan noticed i was struggling a bit to calculate everyone's portion of the bill and he kindly offered to split the bill 6 ways as i had specified to make things easier.... how nice was that?!  excellent food, excellent service - highly recommend dining here.", 
            "my friend and i really wanted to try one of the best steakhouses in vegas, and people kept telling us about how great delmonico was, so we gave it a try. it was my friend's birthday dinner and she is a huge meat eater, i on the other hand don't actually like steak all that much, but wow! it is absolutely impossible not to enjoy your meal here. \n\nwe were in a rush because we had tickets to a show and we were already running late. we advised our maitre d' that we had barely one hour to eat dinner and be on our way. he went above and beyond to make sure we got service fast and made the show on time. not only was he absolutely efficient in making sure our food came out quickly, but he was also super friendly and attentive with us. \n\nour cocktails took no time at all to arrive and were done perfectly. we didn't have time to get appetizers which was a big disappointment, so we went straight for the main course. i had the rib eye and <mark>Country Smashed Potatoes</mark>, my friend had the fillet mignon and <mark>Roasted Fingerling Potatoes</mark>, and we also shared some <mark>Buttered Fresh Asparagus</mark>. all the food was top notch and delicious. my rib eye was cooked to a perfect medium rare, and was well seared on the outside. like i said, i don't particularly like steak but this was mind blowing amazing! i had a few bites of my friend's fillet mignon and it was melt in your mouth goodness. i don't know that it could be possible, but it was even better than my rib eye. amazing. \n\nthe sides were also very good, specially the <mark>Country Smashed Potatoes</mark> which were buttery and creamy. they had bacon and what i think were leeks in them. yum. the asparagus were cooked to perfection and seasoned just right. i did not try the fingerling but my friend said she wasn't overly impressed by them. \n\nmy friend was also surprised with an apple cider sorbet and a candle - for her birthday. the sorbet was delicious, light and refreshing. all in all our visit to delmonico was fantastic and worth every single dollar we paid. dinner here is pricey, but seriously if you find yourself in las vegas, you'd be crazy not to come here!", 
            "i decided to take my wife to las vegas for our first anniversary.  she'd never been to las vegas, but had always wanted to go.  she asked me if we could get dressed up and go somewhere nice one of the nights we were there.  so after doing a little bit of research i stumbled upon delmonico.  with a name like emeril lagasse associated with the place it had to be good right? i went to the website and looked over their menu.  the prices can be very intimidating to someone not used to a fine dining experience.  i really appreciated that the prices were on the menu on the website, because i would not have planned ahead otherwise, and might have choked when i saw them.  however, we only have one first anniversary so i decided we should go for it.  \n\ni called and made a reservation about 5 days in advance, the person on the phone was extremely courteous and helpful.  she asked me if we were celebrating a special occasion.  after i explained it was our first anniversary, she said that she would note it on the reservation.  \n\nwe arrived at delmonico at about 7:55pm, we had reservations for 8pm.  we were greeted at the front desk by a young woman.  she immediately said \"happy anniversary\" and asked us to have a seat in the lounge.  at about 8:05pm our name was called and we were led back to our table.  a table for four quickly became a table for two.  all the extra silverware, plates, and glasses were whisked away.  the serving staff was beyond courteous, even offering us black napkins due to our clothes being black.  \n\ndrink orders were taken and suddenly a plate was placed in front of us. \"courtesy of the chef, for your anniversary.\" said the server.  it was a crostini, with slightly cooked piece of beef, some blue cheese dressing, and chives topped with olive oil.  i hate blue cheese but i ate it anyway, and it was quite good.  \n\nthe server asked my wife about wine, and my wife said she liked it but was not very familiar with the types of wine.  the server asked my wife a few questions and came back with a glass of wine my wife loved, and a sample of another kind of wine she might like to have in the future, my wife loved the sample as well.  \n\nwhen it came time to order, my wife order the heirloom tomato appetizer that they have.  it basically sliced heirloom tomatoes with cheese and red onions, drizzled with oil and balsamic.  she loved it.  she also got the <mark>Filet Mignon</mark>, and <mark>Buttered Fresh Asparagus</mark>.  her steak was amazing, i tried a bite of it.  it was cooked perfectly.  it had a little spice to it from the seasoning, all around it was the best <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> i've ever experienced.  the asparagus was cooked perfectly.  \n\ni ordered the delmonico signature cut, a bone in ribeye.  ribeye is my favorite cut of steak by far.  i've been eating primarily ribeye for so long it's hard to believe that i was ever happy with other cuts.  i also ordered their take on creamed corn.  the ribeye was worth the whole trip, it was the by far the best ribeye i have ever encountered and probably ever will.  it was cooked perfectly.  it had the proper amount of fat that should be expected with a ribeye.  it was amazing.  the corn was really good also.\n\nour server then brought us another complimentary dish from the kitchen, cherry sorbet.  written in chocolate around the outside of the bowl was \"happy anniversary\".  it was pretty good, i'm not a big sorbet person, however please remember, it was free.  \n\neven with the complimentary dessert my wife and i couldn't pass up a chance to try one of the menu dessert items.  we chose butterscotch creme brulee.  it came with 3 butterscotch/chocolate chip cookies on the side.  it was amazing, and probably our new standard for creme brulee.\n\nall in all our experience was awesome.  the food was outstanding and the service was great.  my glass never got empty.  every time i finished a dinner roll another roll was promptly placed on the plate in it's place.  after the 2nd or 3rd roll, i looked over towards my wife, grinning.  the server saw this and quietly said with a smile on her face, \"you know that is going to keep happening.\" i told my wife that when i was over the rolls, i probably needed to leave a bite on the plate to avoid a new roll. it was funny.  \n\ni would recommend delmonico to anyone who is in vegas and looking for a great place to go.  i would encourage anyone who does go to go with the expectation or a fantastic meal.  i think if you go in with the idea of being critical, you will probably find something to complain about, as the couple at the next table did.  they had multiple issues, and sent a few things back to the kitchen.  remember that food preparation is an art not a science, and enjoy.", 
            "our group of 14 was staying at the venetian and delmonicos was our pick for a nice fancy dinner. since we had a night full of drinking ahead of us, we definitely didn't want to over-stuff our stomachs so each couple agreed to share a steak along with lots of appetizers and sides. \n\nto start off, some of us had the <mark><mark>Ahi Tuna</mark> and Salmon Tartare</mark>, wedged salad, baked oysters, french escargot, <mark>Creole Boiled Gulf Shrimp Cocktail</mark>, and <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark>. they were all quite tasty! \n\nthe bf and i shared a <mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark>. asked for medium rare but it came out medium well. i was disappointed since i really hate eating well done meat. luckily the flavoring itself was pretty delicious or i'd definitely have to have it recooked. i also had an addition of <mark>Pan Seared <mark>Foie Gras</mark></mark> as well - which was the absolute best part of my meal. the flavoring and texture was perfect and after my last bite, i found myself wanting more still!\n\nalong with our main entree, we had an order of almost every side they had listed on their dinner menu: <mark>Buttered Fresh Asparagus</mark>, <mark>Buttered Fresh Broccoli</mark>, <mark>Delmonico Creamed Spinach</mark>, sauteed <mark>Sauted Garlic Mushrooms</mark>, mash potatoes, <mark>Creamed Corn Gratine</mark>, and <mark>Potato Gratin</mark>. all the sides are meant to be shared family style and a scoop of each was more than plentiful to compliment your main course. i loved the creamed corn the most. \n\nas full i already was, i saw expresso creme brulee on their dessert menu so of course i couldn't pass up on that. glad i didn't either bc it was fantastic!\n\nservice was excellent and our three waiters were extremely attentive and helpful throughout our entire meal. overall, we had a pleasant dining experience. \n\n3.5 stars because my steak came out medium well instead of medium rare, but because the service was superb, 4 stars it is! next time, get my steak right please =)", 
            "first time here and i will be back!\n\ni made reservations a week before on their website and asked for a nice table.\n\nmy party of 4 arrived early, but no problem- they had our table ready for us!\n\nwe ordered a bottle of cabernet sauvignon ($65) and had the following:\n\ni ordered two appetizers for my entree:\n1. <mark>Vine-Ripened Heirloom Tomato Salad</mark> with burrata cheese, red onion, extra\nvirgin olive oil, balsamic vinegar and torn local basil.\n- i was a little sad that the burrata cheese was so small compared to the heirloom tomatoes, but it was delicious!\n\n2. <mark>Butternut Squash Ravioli</mark> with sage brown butter, toasted hazelnuts and parmesan\n- omg!  so good!  the squash was divine.  i would definitely order this again.\n\n3. grilled marinated organic <mark>Herb Marinated Chicken Breast</mark> - <mark>Roasted Fingerling Potatoes</mark>, whole\ngarlic, wild mushrooms and natural reduction\n- the person that ate this said that the chicken was cooked perfectly and had really good flavor.\n\n4. <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> w/ a twice <mark>Baked Idaho Potato</mark> (with bacon and vermont cheddar) and a <mark>Caesar Salad</mark>.\n- he said that the steak melted in his mouth!\n\n5. surf & turf- bone in ribeye and crab & <mark>Buttered Fresh Asparagus</mark>, i believe. (i don't see it on the menu, so it must be a special)\n- my husband cleaned his plate.\n\nwe also ordered two desserts:\n1. delmonico chocolate layer cake - chocolate pudding, coconut ice cream and\ntoasted almonds\n- looked delicious.  they said it was good and the coconut ice cream was amazing!\n\n2. pecan pie with oatmeal shortbread crust french, vanilla ice cream & caramel sauce\n- pie was in the shape of a circle, so the center was ooey and gooey and yummy!!  very good!\n\nprice was about $300+ for the table (not including tip).\n\nthe service was outstanding!  we actually had 3 people waiting on us and never had to ask for anything.  they were on-point with re-filling the water at the table!  it was so nice to never have to look around for someone to help us.  the timing of everything was beautiful.\n\nwe even got an amuse-bouche bruschetta when we were deciding what to have for dinner.  what a nice surprise!!", 
            "i came here with some girlfriends during my bachelorette weekend in vegas. we had a reservation for 7 girls, and were very promptly sat at our reservation hour.\n\nthe service here is spectacular, and the food is equally enjoyable. my girls and i shared our entrees and side dishes, so that we could each have a taste of a little bit of everything.\n\nentrees:\n- <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> - 9 oz, and absolutely melt-in-your-mouth yummy. this cut was like butter.\n- <mark>Emeril's BBQ Salmon</mark> - also melted like butter with every bite. it was amazing how tender, yet well-cooked the fish was. the hash side dish that came with the meal was very complimentary!\n- grilled marinated organic <mark>Herb Marinated Chicken Breast</mark> - mostly juicy (a teeny bit dry), but great flavors. the <mark>Roasted Fingerling Potatoes</mark> were pretty standard, and the wild mushrooms weren't very tasty to me.\n- bone in ribeye - 20 oz, and great for sharing! our waiter even cut the steak for our girls so that each could have medium rare/well.\n- american red snapper - the sides didn't seem as appealing at first for my friend who had this dish, but she ended up enjoying them!\n\nsides:\n- creamed corn gratin\\u00c9e - delicious. a great combination of that sweet and salty flavor. texture was right on point!\n- <mark>Buttered Fresh Asparagus</mark> - fabulous crunch, and not so much flavor added to cover up the natural enjoyable flavor of the veggie\n\nall in all, a great experience. we weren't too full at the end of the meal, and didn't have to worry about wasting any food or taking back any leftovers.\n\nhighly recommended!", 
            "after eating at delmonico, i seriously didn't want to eat for days! i ordered the <mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark> and my my, it was humongous. i finished the whole thing (no, not the bone also). it was a really delicious piece of meat. it was cooked medium rare perfectly. as if the steak wasn't rich enough for us... we decided to add on the <mark>Pan Seared <mark>Foie Gras</mark></mark>. very good piece of fat! for the sides, we ordered the corn, cream of spinach, broccoli and <mark>Buttered Fresh Asparagus</mark>. much needed to counter the meat. \n\nservice was excellent as you expect it to be. i really enjoyed this place and it is great for a fancy dinner one of your nights in las vegas. note that you probably don't want to do anything after. food coma to the maxxxxxxxxxxxxx!", 
            "in town for business, had several great meals. however tonight i am eating alone and craving a nice piece of prime cut. i chose this restaurant based on rating and expected value. \n\nordered the bone-in prime ribeye, a signature dish, asparagus and a glass of house red. \n\nthe service was excellent for the entire meal. the table bread was good but in my opinion was really better suited for breakfast or needed gravy like yorkshire pudding. the house red (a cab) was excellent, sorry forgot what i ordered, but it was the least expensive but was very good. \n\nwas served quickly, if i had clients with me i would hope for a little slower pace but alone the speed was appreciated. \n\nthe asparagus was perfect, not over cooked or smothered with too much butter, and very tender. the ribeye however came up very short, lacked taste and was tough, not what you would expect from aged prime ribeye. the waiter respond quickly and offered a new steak, i decided on the filet. i was served as fast as possible, the new steak rectified the problem, perfectly charbroiled, taste and texture as expected. also served <mark>Buttered Fresh Asparagus</mark>. \n\ndessert, ordered the pecan tart and a cap. both very good. the pecan very tasteful, the filling was not too runny or too sweet and the pecans were fresh with a deep southern taste. the crust was very favorable and went well with the carmel and house made ice cream and whipping cream. \n\nother notes, good lighting and i liked the architectural ceiling. chairs are stylist and very comfortable. i recommend adjusting the traffic flow, two much weaving required and not ideal for guest seated in wrong location. never like sitting near restroom entrance, which i was; as much as i like most people watching i would of asked to be moved if with clients or my spouse. lastly white sugar cubes, really?"

            "if i had to choose between delmonico or carnevino ribeye, the choice is simple. delmonico. two amazing restaurants, two different styles, but personal preference would land me at delmonico.\n\nw-o-w. flavorful steak, huge portions, it was really, really hard to hide my semi while i was tearing into the meat. great side dishes like <mark>Sauted Garlic Mushrooms</mark>, amazing peach cobbler for dessert, great red wine, attentive wait staff... pure bliss. better than wearing my clown suit at an elementary school. way better. well... no, that's a bold statement. but it's friggin close.", 
            "i was the best man and thus we came to vegas, we saw, and we ate at delmonico's (among other things).\n\ntable for 13 men out on the town for my friend's bachelor party.\n\ni can't remember what everyone ordered but i can tell you that nobody complained about the food (not drunk yet and therefore enjoyed the food fully).\n\nthe <mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark> was marvelous.  the calamari was good as was the <mark>Classic Steak Tartare</mark>. side dishes: new orleans <mark>Delmonico Creamed Spinach</mark>, <mark>Truffle and Parmesan Potato Chips</mark> and saut\\u00e9ed <mark>Sauted Garlic Mushrooms</mark> were all excellent!  the sides are quite large so please share because yeah, we ordered too many.\n\ntotal bill for 13 (which included some drinks) was about $1100 which is not bad for a nice high-end place that serves the best ribeye.  if you like porterhouse, then go try the porterhouse at keens steakhouse in nyc.", 
            "7 girls, after a long 4 hour drive, arrived at the venetian on a mission for some hearty steak.  delmonico was the answer to our problem.  we were so exhausted that we didn't even bother pretty-ing ourselves up before hand...dumped out bags and headed straight to dinner.  we were worried that our shorts and flip-flop attire wasn't going to cut it but aside from some dirty stares from some of the other guests, the wait staff kindly turned their heads.  \n\nthe service was impeccable.   they started us off with a goat cheese puff pastry to cleanse our pallets, compliments of the chef.  all of us buddied up and ordered the <mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark> steak...which was plenty to go around.  tasty, it sure was but i'd have to say, i've had better.  the <mark>Sauted Garlic Mushrooms</mark>, creamed corn, cheddar bacon grits, and sauteed asparagus sides were great compliments set in the middle of the table for all of us to share.  we were seated at a circular table which was ideal for conversation instead of screaming across a long table.  by dessert, we were stuffed...next time for sure.  \n\nsince we didn't order any wine to compliment the dinners that we all split, delmonico left the robbing of our $$ to the casinos.  i know if i went with just my boyfriend, it'd be one less night we could stay at the venetian.", 
            "my hubby and i had date night here before seeing zumanity- this was one of the best steaks i have ever had. we are from texas, so we know good steak. i got mine crusted with blue cheese. we had the <mark>Sauted Garlic Mushrooms</mark> and 2x <mark>Baked Idaho Potato</mark>. the atmosphere is great and the dessert was amazng. we had the banana cream pie. to die for!!! we booked online!!!", 
            "is it okay not to rave about this place? apologies to emeril. i think you're cool. really, i do.\n\nvisited the land of sin about a month ago and went to dinner at delmonico. i was impressed with the steak, but extremely underwhelmed with the appetizers and sides.\n\nshared a <mark>Bone-In New York Strip</mark> steak, cooked medium rare, with a friend. de-f'ing-licious. i didn't really like or crave steak until a recent trip to puerto rico (a food story for another time) but now i think i've learned to appreciate the awesomeness of a giant hunk of meat. the waiter was nice enough to split the steak onto two places, and it was sooooo good.\n\nhowever.\nthe appetizers and sides were another story.\n\n- <mark>Truffle and Parmesan Potato Chips</mark> - supposedly a specialty, but i found these too oily (yea yea, i know. truffle oil.) and too rich.\n- bbq shrimp w/ rosemary biscuit - came with 4 (i think) sizable shrimp, but i found it too salty, and really nothing special.\n- <mark>Delmonico Creamed Spinach</mark> - very ehhhh. i've had better.\n- sauteed <mark>Sauted Garlic Mushrooms</mark> - okay, so you can't go wrong with garlic & mushrooms. these were a bit oily too, but pretty good none-the-less.", 
            "really good steakhouse! we went there for our friend's birthday. the environment is nice but maybe a tiny bit noisier as i expected. my boyfriend and i ordered a <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> to share, which was good but not especially exciting. he ordered a <mark>Filet Mignon</mark>, i believe, and was fantastic! it literally melted in my mouth and we were able to cut it with a butter knife.. so tender! i ordered a season entree - grilled halibut on a bed of lumbcrab meat w/ some kind of aioli. it was alright... the crab was tasty but the fish was a bit dry... \n\nour friend ordered the tournedos au poivre and his girlfriend ordered the ribeye. the ribeye was huge for the price! we also ordered a couple of sides to share - new orleans <mark>Delmonico Creamed Spinach</mark>, sauteed <mark>Sauted Garlic Mushrooms</mark> <mark>Truffle and Parmesan Potato Chips</mark>. i have to say the mushrooms was really good! didn't really care for the <mark>Delmonico Creamed Spinach</mark> because it was too heavy for me. the chips was good, too, but i wanted to compare it to alexander's truffle oil fries... that's one of my future plans =p\n\noverall, i think the steaks are worth the price. other stuff are good but not extremely exciting.... i guess you should always go for the steaks at a steakhouse!", 
            "disappointing or too high of expectations? \n\nwhen i am spending $50 for a steak (<mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark>) which was recommended by the waiter was the best steak on the menu i have particularly high expectations. the dishes are all a la carte so i also ordered a side of asparagus, potatoes augratin and <mark>Sauted Garlic Mushrooms</mark>. \n\nthe steak was a large serving (14 oz) but i found it lacked in flavor for my expectations. i have had better steak at high end restaurants....", 
            "one of best steaks i've had. definitely a solid 4.5 even better, i dined on <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark>, a bone in ribeye  steak w/ <mark>Country Smashed Potatoes</mark>, <mark>Sauted Garlic Mushrooms</mark> and <mark>Delmonico Creamed Spinach</mark>. \n\nmy steak was was cooked to perfection, juicy throughout. not to mention the little things such as the pat of compound butter that added that punch. the <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> was smooth and rich. the sides we're all great as well. \n\nthe pricing was fair, it is a la carte steakhouse after all thats what you come to expect at an establishment like this. service was just right, very attentive but at the same time the wait staff wasnt breathing down our neck. loved my experience here, hopefully we will back again soon!", 
            "our group of 14 was staying at the venetian and delmonicos was our pick for a nice fancy dinner. since we had a night full of drinking ahead of us, we definitely didn't want to over-stuff our stomachs so each couple agreed to share a steak along with lots of appetizers and sides. \n\nto start off, some of us had the <mark><mark>Ahi Tuna</mark> and Salmon Tartare</mark>, wedged salad, baked oysters, french escargot, <mark>Creole Boiled Gulf Shrimp Cocktail</mark>, and <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark>. they were all quite tasty! \n\nthe bf and i shared a <mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark>. asked for medium rare but it came out medium well. i was disappointed since i really hate eating well done meat. luckily the flavoring itself was pretty delicious or i'd definitely have to have it recooked. i also had an addition of <mark>Pan Seared <mark>Foie Gras</mark></mark> as well - which was the absolute best part of my meal. the flavoring and texture was perfect and after my last bite, i found myself wanting more still!\n\nalong with our main entree, we had an order of almost every side they had listed on their dinner menu: <mark>Buttered Fresh Asparagus</mark>, <mark>Buttered Fresh Broccoli</mark>, <mark>Delmonico Creamed Spinach</mark>, sauteed <mark>Sauted Garlic Mushrooms</mark>, mash potatoes, <mark>Creamed Corn Gratine</mark>, and <mark>Potato Gratin</mark>. all the sides are meant to be shared family style and a scoop of each was more than plentiful to compliment your main course. i loved the creamed corn the most. \n\nas full i already was, i saw expresso creme brulee on their dessert menu so of course i couldn't pass up on that. glad i didn't either bc it was fantastic!\n\nservice was excellent and our three waiters were extremely attentive and helpful throughout our entire meal. overall, we had a pleasant dining experience. \n\n3.5 stars because my steak came out medium well instead of medium rare, but because the service was superb, 4 stars it is! next time, get my steak right please =)", 
            "dined there last weekend with some friends and we were utterly disappointed. not impressed one bit.\ni don't understand how this restaurant received such high ratings, but i certainly would not go back nor would i recommend to anyone.\nfrom the food, the service, the ambiance - huge let down.\n\ni would've given this place an additional star if the service wasn't so terrible.  the server was slow and was more interested in chatting.  also, we waited at least 30 min to get our entrees(they didn't even seem busy). \nafter our table was cleared from apps and salads, we waited 20+ min before calling our server to check up on our food. she said it was still within the \"window\" and she couldn't do anything. luckily, she spoke to her manager after another 5-10 min because that's when our food was \"officially late.\" \n\nwhat we had (from what i can recall):\nbbq shrimp - shrimps were cooked unevenly and drowned in mediocre bbq sauce. some were cooked well, but mine was under. \n<mark>Vine-Ripened Heirloom Tomato Salad</mark> - nothing special\nbaked crab stuffed lobster - <mark>Roasted Maine Lobster Tail</mark> cooked well, but tough to eat and nothing amazing\nny strip - no flavor\nfilet - nice crust from the essence stuff\nsauteed <mark>Sauted Garlic Mushrooms</mark> - standard\n<mark>Potato Gratin</mark> - bit on the dry side\ncreamed corn gratin - best side order we had on the table, but that doesn't mean much.\n\ndessert:\nsorbet, banana cream pie, apple fritters, key lime pie.\nthe desserts and our bottle of wine were probably the highlight of this dinner.\n\nif you are looking for a good steakhouse on the strip, this is not the place.\nyou'll probably have better luck at mastro's, stripsteak, prime, or craftsteak.", 
            "exceptional, delicious, great service!  everything from the appetizer (special salad with humboldt fog goat cheese, peaches, prosciutto) to the meal (filet, medium rare) to the dessert (banana cr\\u00e8me pie was to die for) were amazing.  don't leave here without ordering the <mark>Sauted Garlic Mushrooms</mark>- they were amazing.  we were stuck on which wine to order and our waiter gave us an excellent recommendation. \n\ni will be back!", 
            "always on the hunt for the perfect steakhouse i took up some yelp recommendations and gave this place a try. we were a party of 6 and truth be told we were running on fumes from the prior evenings festivities (how strange...in vegas??) so this review is based on our less than average appetites. although we did order a lot more than we could manage to eat.\n\ntheir most popular steak is probably the bone in rib-eye and it's a whopping 16 ounces (without bone)...quite hefty and although the steak was cooked to perfection it was definitely under seasoned. it also seemed mine had a bit more fat than usual which is as we know is where all the flavour is but it seemed perhaps a bit too much. all the sides were awesome and their meant to be shared family style... definitely try the <mark>Sauted Garlic Mushrooms</mark>!\n\nservice was top notch...not in your face but always there making sure your wine is topped off and full of suggestions when you need.\n\ni've been to stk in vegas and if you're looking for the more swank place you might want to hit that up but for a more authentic steakhouse experience i'd definitely recommend delmonico...",
