            "8 of us gathered here for lunch yesterday.  for starters, we ordered two quesoin fundidos, one with mushrooms and the other with chorizo.  we also got an ordered of garlic lime fried chapulines (grasshoppers).  with the quesos, we were brought both corn and flour tortillas.  \n\nfor the main part of lunch, we got their grande feast plate which the menu says serves 10-12.  the grande feast consists of two feast plates--the peque\\u00f1o which serves 3-4 people and the mediano which serves 6-8 people.  the peque\\u00f1o consists of steak, carnitas & <mark>Pulled Chicken Burrito</mark>, pulled chicken or cheese <mark>12 Quesadilla</mark> and beef & chicken taquitos.  the mediano platter consists of sliced carne asada, grilled chicken, grilled shrimp & chorizo with <mark>Queso Fundido <mark>Tostaditas de Tinga <mark>Mexican Shrimp Cocktail <mark>Pozole <mark>Albondigas Soup <mark>Mexican Chili <mark>Carnitas <mark>Al Pastor <mark>Carne Asada <mark>Pulled Chicken <mark>Cochinita Taco <mark>Corn Rajas Tacos <mark>Grilled Mahi <mark>Veggie <mark>Shrimp Taco <mark>Lettuce Wraps <mark>Cheese <mark>Chicken <mark>Beef <mark>Seafood Enchiladas <mark>SunFed Ranch Organic Grilled Steak <mark>Mary s Free Range Organic Chicken <mark>Grilled Wild Pacific Shrimp <mark>Steak <mark>Chicken <mark><mark>Chicken Steak and Shrimp Combo Fajita Platter <mark>Chicken Feinstein <mark>Siegel <mark>Yemenidjian Taco Plate <mark>Steak <mark>Chicken <mark>Shrimp <mark>Veggie Bowl <mark>Chipotle Chicken <mark>Carne Asada <mark>Pork Carnitas <mark>Cochinita Pibil <mark>Cilantro Garlic Shrimp <mark>Cedar Chipotle Salmon <mark>Pineapple Shrimp <mark>Tropical Mahi <mark>Mexican Corn <mark>Seasonal Veggies Gluten Free</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark>, cactus, grilled onions & chiles.  \n\nthere was more than enough for these hungry eaters.  carne asada, grilled chicken, and grilled shrimp of the mediano were very well cooked and seasoned quite well.  i had some of a <mark>Pulled Chicken Burrito</mark> from the peque\\u00f1o platter and it was well prepared.  the chapulines were good put a bit pricey at $12.  \n\nfor dessert, we got three complimentary <mark>Flan</mark> (one for each yelp check in) and we got one order of <mark>Tres Leches Cake</mark>.  the flan was standard.  i really enjoyed the <mark>Tres Leches Cake</mark>.  too bad we had to share!\n\nwhile we were eating, the general manager, christian umlauf, visited our table and talked with us about the restaurant and was very genial and a gracious host.  shortly after, chef paco, the executive chef, came to the table and brought a bag of spicy nuts that his mother sends him from mexico city.  he shared a good part of the bag with us in a styrofoam cup.  a very pleasant man who explained some of the dishes.\n\njesse was our server and he did an outstanding job!  he kept water glasses filled, brought more tortillas as needed, and was always available when we had a equation.\n\nel dorado has been on my radar since yelp had an event there and i was unable to attend because of a conflict.  i will be going back to try some of their signature items.  the restaurant is very nicely appointed.",

none of this an issue when taking a look at plate two, each overstuffed burrito amongst the best i've tasted in recent memory while taquitos were light and greaseless, the chicken quesadilla also quite special with onions adding a smoky, aromatic punch.\n\nadmittedly full, to the point where a solid meal or two's worth of food was boxed up to go, it was still without hesitation that dessert was ordered and although the boozy tres leches was quite excellent beneath whipped cream <mark>Steak <mark>Chicken <mark><mark>Chicken Steak and Shrimp Combo Fajita Platter <mark>Chicken Feinstein <mark>Siegel <mark>Yemenidjian Taco Plate <mark>Steak <mark>Chicken <mark>Shrimp <mark>Veggie Bowl <mark>Chipotle Chicken <mark>Carne Asada <mark>Pork Carnitas <mark>Cochinita Pibil <mark>Cilantro Garlic Shrimp <mark>Cedar Chipotle Salmon <mark>Pineapple Shrimp <mark>Tropical Mahi <mark>Mexican Corn <mark>Seasonal Veggies Gluten Free</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark> fruit it was chef paco's ancient flan recipe that stole my heart, the texture far more thick than many would associate with the dish, but each caramel tinged bite proving as good as the last until each plate was clean, the chef himself standing tableside and offering gifts from a care packaged straight from mexico while discussing his passion for cooking as the meal reached an end.\n\norganic + non-gmo + 24/7 + authentic mexican food + next to a strip club = an equation only las vegas could dream up, and like many things in this fabulous city it works like a charm.", 
            "oh my various gods! this place is just what vegas needed - a mexican restaurant that makes authentic mexican food while at the same time taking gastronomical risks! \n\ni know that this place isn't going to be for everybody. i also know that it takes a certain type of person to walk towards the blue neon of sapphire at 2 am for mexican food. the unassuming entrance gives way to a modern dining room and bar. it's well lit, yet there's an abundance of velvet and mirrors and the knowledge of what is going on on the other side of that wall that give el dorado its distinct vegas-y vibe... this isn't the place for children to order <mark>12 Quesadilla</mark> while their parents drink margaritas!\n\nthere are crickets on this menu. \n\ndelicious, spicy, crickets. you should order them. you'll be a better person for it. \n\nthey also serve ghost pepper salsa. you should only order this if you're ready. the flavor is amazing but the heat is serious and lasting! if you're not sure just start off slow and see how much heat you can take (if the habanero salsa they gave you with the chips when you first sat down scared you then don't order the ghost pepper salsa!).  this salsa is one of the most wonderful things i've ever had so if you're of a type that enjoys the flavor of pain i highly recommend this salsa!\n\nthere are, of course, many traditional items on this menu that you'll recognize and love: fresh guacamole, tacos, burritos, enchiladas... but they also have a selection of mole` and that's what makes this place special. i tried the sampler plate and found each of them unique and enjoyable in their own way. my personal favorite being the darker, chocolate based mole`.\n\nel dorado cantina is the kind of place you go to at the beginning or the end of a night of drinking, a refuge from the neon, sanctuary from boring americanized mexican food.", 
            "what a great little find. our friends invited us the the el dorado cantina. the gps told us to turn right into the parking lot which is coincidently sapphires gentlemen's club. the restaurant is right next door! always good to start the morning off with a chuckle. we walked into the restaurant which has the walls appointed in a red  motif with wood finishing. it is just funky enough to be cool & hip with big screens so you can watch sports. ok, enough about that...how about the food? i applaud this restaurant, they are non gmo and source their food  from sustainable farms. our server was very pleasant & immediately brought u<mark>Mary s Free Range Organic Chicken <mark>Grilled Wild Pacific Shrimp <mark>Steak <mark>Chicken <mark><mark>Chicken Steak and Shrimp Combo Fajita Platter <mark>Chicken Feinstein <mark>Siegel <mark>Yemenidjian Taco Plate <mark>Steak <mark>Chicken <mark>Shrimp <mark>Veggie Bowl <mark>Chipotle Chicken <mark>Carne Asada <mark>Pork Carnitas <mark>Cochinita Pibil <mark>Cilantro Garlic Shrimp <mark>Cedar Chipotle Salmon <mark>Pineapple Shrimp <mark>Tropical Mahi <mark>Mexican Corn <mark>Seasonal Veggies Gluten Free</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark> chips & 3 kinds of salsa. debby ordered guacamole which was prepared fresh table side and delicious. we shared steak <mark>12 Quesadilla</mark> & queso fundido. our friends had the mole combination platter that could have fed the table. great food! will return here.", 
            "once again el dorado cantina is simply divine!\n\nmy high school friend from los angeles came into town and of course i suggested lunch at el dorado cantina! well, where else would i go for a scrumptious perfect lunch? no, im not embellishing this review, the food is that superb. honestly cant believe how good it really is.\n\ni ordered the shrimp taquitos again! my friends ordered <mark>12 Quesadilla</mark>, table side guacamole and the salmon entree. we were all so happy and clearly stuffed by the end of lunch, but we made room for the famous flan!\n\nthe complimentary chips and three salsa sides is yummy. my favorite is the habenero salsa(careful its super hot, but i like it that hot in my mouth!)\n\ncheck in with yelp and receive a free flan! yes, you must try this amazing desert, its worth it beyond words.\n\nmmmmmmmmm delicious!\n5 stars? i give 10 stars and counting!!!"

            "this place is stellar mexican food.  so far i have yet to find a great mexican spot, but this might be it.  i have had several dishes off of the menu which were all tasty.  \n\n     however the garlic shrimp was bomb, i love the beans here also.  i had the fried chicken i forgot the name, it was good however if it came with sauce it would be better so i added there chipotle cream which made it right.  taquitos and <mark>Imperial Shrimp</mark> apps are delicious.  you have to order the lemonade <mark>Daily Agua Fresca</mark>, so bomb i had about 5 glasses.  i'm not a big sangria drinker but even that was tasty. desert the churros are so good, they come with a little cream filling and a banana foster sauce to dip them in.  flan has a cheesecake like consistency which i like, because i don't care for traditional flan and the eggy taste.  i will definitely go back. so many good dishes and chef paco can custom make dishes to your taste. \n\n     some dishes are $25 and i think they could be a little cheaper however on average dishes are $10-$17. its good for groups and even coming in by yourself has a nice open layout and friendly staff.  if you come to vegas for mexican food near the strip or just good flavors, try it.", 
            "first time here. i was relieved to find out it's only next door to sapphires and not part of it. very nice decor and atmosphere.  amber was our server. she gave impeccable service.  chef paco came around and introduced himself, asking if we needed anything.  we tried the <mark>Imperial Shrimp</mark> for an app. seafood stuffed shrimp, wrapped in bacon... yum!!! i had the chicken enchiladas and he had the pork carnitas. amazing food. definitely recommend.  they have free salsa lessons on tuesdays and it's latin night on wednesdays. great service & great food. highly recommend!", 
            "this place is a diamond in the rough cause it's hard to notice but once here u will fall in love w/ the food & drinks. plus the service is right there w/ any 5 star restaurant as they r very attentive to you. felt as if i should wear a suit & tie just to eat here due to the incredible service i received.\n\nplus if u need a little retouch on your latin dance moves they got you w/ dance lessons on tuesdays 6pm-7pm & 8pm-9pm\n\nmy recommendation is the <mark>Tres Leches Cake</mark> & the <mark>Imperial Shrimp</mark>. \n\neveryone needs to come down and make this the new locals spot as it operates 24/7 like true vegas style.", 
            "el dorado cantina is one of my favorite new restaurants in town.  this definitely rivals javier's at aria for the \"high end\" vegas mexican cuisine market, but the prices are way more reasonable.  chef paco and his staff are churning out some really good stuff.  \n\nwant a great way to spice up a weekday dinner?  how about doing as the aztecs did back in the day (century) and start off with some grasshoppers?  yes, sir!  edc's \"chapulines\" can be prepared saut\\u00e9ed either in garlic lime or habanero.  for the uninitiated, the closest thing to compare them to would be crispy shrimp tails but juicier.  the habanero order offered terrific heat and not in a painful, shoot me in the face kind of way.  at $7.50, it was a large portion that could have easily satisfied a party of six.  not for everyone by any means, my wife was literally one and done, but i enjoyed it and had plenty to take home (fried rice, anyone?).\n\n\"<mark>Imperial Shrimp</mark>\" was everything i look for in an appetizer: seafood stuffed pacific wild shrimp wrapped in bacon and then lightly fried. the creamy heat (sounds gross, right?) from the chipotle ranch dressing that accompanied the dish was awesome.  more things in life should be wrapped in bacon!  i should start a national campaign.\n\nwe chose to split the humungous carne asada entr\\u00e9e.  the citrus marinated steak was medium rare perfection.  i loved the big slabs of grilled cactus that it came with.  we probably boxed up 70 percent of the plate.  goddamn nachos and salsa....\n\nyou'd think that would prevent us from ordering dessert, but the flan and <mark>Tres Leches Cake</mark> somehow made it to the table.  the latter was plated nicely and the rum flavor made me feel like i was on vacation.  it was a great end to the meal and i can't wait to try more.", 
            "honestly had to be one of the best mexican style restaurants i've been to in las vegas. our waiter jesse blew every previous expectation by providing above and beyond customer service, our table was never empty. the chef has blended some to die for dishes including my new favorite <mark>Imperial Shrimp</mark>, delicately fried and wrapped in bacon i'll be back for them alone. from start to finish a wonderful experience will be back soon.", 
            "went based on reviews. ordered a margarita and was asked if i wanted it plain or strawberry (wasn't told strawberry would be extra). the margarita looked better then it tasted. ordered the <mark>Imperial Shrimp</mark> and 2 orders of the taco plate. shrimp was delicious and tacos took over an hour to come out. finally received our tacos but it was not what we ordered :( 20 minutes later and our tacos were finally here! server gave me a free drink for messing up on our order. tacos were ok, it was a monday so locals get 50% off the entire bill. probably wouldn't go back to pay full price. i'd rather go to pepe's", 
            "on a recent trip to vegas, i checked this place out. first, don't be fooled by the bad reviews about it being attached to a strip club! yes, you will see the people going into the strip club. yes, you will see some of the club bouncers. no, they don't share a kitchen. if you don't want to, you never have to enter the strip club! get over it! it's in vegas!\n\nwhen i went in, i immediately sat down at the bar. tiffany was my waitress/bartender. i got a sampler with <mark>Imperial Shrimp</mark> (seafood stuffed shrimp wrapped in bacon), tostaditas de tinga, and empanadas. also got a plate of al pastor tacos and a side of the ghost chili salsa. finished with the churros. had a couple of beers with all of this and a jalapeno margarita.\n\neverything was...amazing! first, i don't like shrimp. i don't hate them, but i don't like them. the flavor of the shrimp with the bacon was amazing! the texture was perfect and they were perfectly cooked. the tostadas and empanadas were the perfect size, and everything tasted extremely fresh. they weren't overly seasoned and they went perfectly with the double ipa i had. the tacos were also perfectly prepared with just enough of every topping that you didn't feel overwhelmed by anything. i ended up putting the ghost chili salsa on the tacos because the flavor was the perfect compliment to to the tacos.\n\nwhile waiting for the churros, i had the jalapeno margarita. it had the perfect amount of kick while not being overly sweet. the spicy flavors with the salt and the tangy lime made it blend really well.\n\nfinally, the churros. ohhhhhhh...the churros. i can't say enough about them! they are stuffed with apple and are awesome!!! wow! if you go here for nothing else, then get the churros! \n\nall of this comes together with an amazing staff. chef paco makes some killer food and is extremely funny and nice! he comes around to everyone to check on them, talk about the food, and just generally seems to love to have a good time! tiffany was also amazing! she made the salsa in front of me and also made the margarita.\n\ni can definitely say that i will be back on my next trip to vegas!", 
            "everything was so tasty. we ordered a few small plates to share. <mark>Imperial Shrimp</mark> is off the chain! came around 2:30 .. great timing! we were the only ones in there for a bit. fantastic service from chris & chef paco visited the table. classy decor. open 24 hrs. local food done right. highly recommend!", 
            "my last outing here was fine on the whole, but there were some discordant notes.  \n\ntableside guac was very good but noticeably salty, while albondigas soup was excellent, with savory meatballs standing out in a hot vegetable-oriented broth.  although <mark>Imperial Shrimp</mark> wrapped in bacon and lightly fried was a good starter, i believe the dish would taste better without the fish stuffing.  \n\nmy main of a slow cooked <mark>Carnitas Rajas Burrito</mark>, packed with marinated pork and cilantro rice, roasted peppers, refried beans, fresh guacamole, a mexican blend of three cheeses, and avocado salsa in a warm flour tortilla, featured tender carnitas and was both filling and satisfying.  but i would have liked more pico de gallo and a saucier burrito.  and a mound of cilantro rice on the side, outside the burrito, seemed superfluous.  \n\nseating was comfortable but there was not a heavy server presence, and the waiters who attended our table kept switching.   at meal's end i had to ask two different servers for the check, and the men's restroom was messy.  nevertheless, because the food here is noticeably fresh, clean, and composed of high quality ingredients, and is available 24 hours, el dorado cantina is an asset to the las vegas mexican cuisine dining scene, and worth another look.\n\n3-1/2 stars overall on this visit."

            "food is amazing!!!!! if you like fresh mexican food this is the place for you.  they believe in sustainably-raised products, where all of their beef, chicken, pork, shrimp, and fish originate from carefully-selected farms in the u.s. and are free from antibiotics, pesticides, and steroids. or so said their website, and i believe it.  i always get their <mark>Tostada Salad</mark> and it is so fresh and full of goodness that i always ask them not to add the dressing.  the service is just okay... i do takeaway but have sat down twice and felt like i was inconveniencing them.  as far as service goes they aren't the worst but they are the best.  like i said i loved the fresh food.  my friend said the tacos were greasy but she is a bit of a debbie downer so i take it with a grain of salt. \ndo note they are in the sapphire gentlemen's club parking lot.  there entrance is in the same building just a couple feet away :)", 
            "great place for a work lunch! had the <mark>Tostada Salad</mark> with shrimp - the presentation was beautiful and the chipotle ranch dressing had so much flavor with just enough heat for me. the portions are huge but i made sure to save room for dessert.  i must say chef paco's flan is the best i've ever tasted - the texture was perfect and the flavor was heavenly.  will definitely be back again soon!"

            "el dorado cantina is a month shy of its grand opening, yet it's already a gem. i was eager to try it after such promising reviews. i had read it is next to sapphire, but i didn't take it literally. i should have, because it is indeed in the same building but with its own entrance. the restaurant is upscale and our group of four were cozy in a booth. \n\nwe started with house margaritas and cold cervezas. we were quickly brought chips and three types of salsa: mild, tomatillo and habanero. all were fresh and delicious. we couldn't resist the tableside guacamole ($12). it did not disappoint! \n\nmoving on to entrees, we tried the <mark>Carne Asada Burrito</mark> ($12.50), carnitas tacos ($7.50, seafood enchilada ($13.50) and milaneza ($17.50). everything wa<mark>Mary s Free Range Organic Chicken <mark>Grilled Wild Pacific Shrimp <mark>Steak <mark>Chicken <mark><mark>Chicken Steak and Shrimp Combo Fajita Platter <mark>Chicken Feinstein <mark>Siegel <mark>Yemenidjian Taco Plate <mark>Steak <mark>Chicken <mark>Shrimp <mark>Veggie Bowl <mark>Chipotle Chicken <mark>Carne Asada <mark>Pork Carnitas <mark>Cochinita Pibil <mark>Cilantro Garlic Shrimp <mark>Cedar Chipotle Salmon <mark>Pineapple Shrimp <mark>Tropical Mahi <mark>Mexican Corn <mark>Seasonal Veggies Gluten Free</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark> and tasty. we were all very pleased.\n\nthey are currently offering specials and happy hours; hopefully, they will continue. it's been a long time, since i've had an enjoyable sit down meal in a mexican restaurant. you wouldn't expect a restaurant of this caliber given the location, but it delivers. i'm already planning my next visit.", 
            "i tried the queso fundido(?)..not good. the <mark>Carne Asada Burrito</mark>..pretty damn amazing, and got the carnitas street tacos with rice and black beans for my wife. also amazing. well definitely be back here.", 
            "the only non-gmo restaurant in las vegas!! they take pride in where they source their ingredients from and how they prepare their food and you can tell. we went on locals monday which earned us 50% off our entire bill! the only surprising/humorous thing is that they are located in the same building as sapphires gentleman club....lol. as long as you are not super conservative this should not offend you. they have their own separate entrance.  the restaurant is gorgeous. they had a great selection of beers however they were out of the ones we ordered, no worries they provided us with great alternatives. we ordered the gorditas to start with. i ordered the chicken milanessa and my bf ordered an <mark>Carne Asada Burrito</mark>.  both were very delicious, i only wish we had room for dessert  i will definitely be back and telling all my friends about this place!", 
            "we went to this restaurant based on reviews seen on yelp. we made reservations for 7:30 on a saturday night. upon arrival we were quickly seated. i was shocked that this place was next to a strip club but you would never know it once inside. the decor was festive and modern. there are large booths around a bar. once seated someone brought  a few waters and said will return with chips. he came back and said someone would be with us soon to take our order. we waited about 10 minutes and no one returned. the same person came back and said he would take our drink order and someone else would take our food order. he suggested we start on the table side guacamole and we agreed. we watched the server go to the bartender and tell him he wasn't sure who our server was supposed to be but we had been sitting there awhile.  it was definitely awkward. the gm of the restaurant also came by but still no waiter. he came back with our delicious but spicy jalape\\u00f1o margaritas and we snacked on chips and salsa. there were three provided: a red salsa with medium heat, a green salsa very flavorful, and a thin red sauce that looked and tasted like straight up hot sauce. it would have been nice if there was an explanation of the three. next was the table side guacamole. the server came with all the fixings and asked us what we preferred in our guacamole. he went over the menu, explaining everything was non gmo including the chips. he also apologized that our server still hadn't been by. there were two small wedding parties taking place but aside from that there were only three other tables including ours. no real excuse for our \"waiter\" to not have been by in the 30 minutes we had been there. we snacked on the guacamole which needed more salt but overall was very good. you could taste the fresh avocado <mark>Steak <mark>Chicken <mark><mark>Chicken Steak and Shrimp Combo Fajita Platter <mark>Chicken Feinstein <mark>Siegel <mark>Yemenidjian Taco Plate <mark>Steak <mark>Chicken <mark>Shrimp <mark>Veggie Bowl <mark>Chipotle Chicken <mark>Carne Asada <mark>Pork Carnitas <mark>Cochinita Pibil <mark>Cilantro Garlic Shrimp <mark>Cedar Chipotle Salmon <mark>Pineapple Shrimp <mark>Tropical Mahi <mark>Mexican Corn <mark>Seasonal Veggies Gluten Free</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark> smashed garlic. \n\nour waiter finally showed up and i asked his opinion on what dish to order. he said hmm let me see the menu and suggested the pork chili verde. my fianc\\u00e9 ordered a <mark>Carne Asada Burrito</mark>. our food came quickly, almost too quickly compared to the wait for a waiter.  the mole looked unappetizing on the plate chucks of meat under a thick green sauce covered in pepitas. i have had mole before but it never looked like this. i tasted a chuck of meat which was fork tender. it was hard to get it down. the meat tasted microwaved! my fianc\\u00e9 tasted it and suggested i eat half of his burrito it was that bad! i decided to taste another piece, it was inedible there was no way i could eat it. i moved on to the black beans...horrible too! they lacked in flavor and seasoning. it was like they opened the can and put it on a plate. the cilantro rice along side tasted like uncle bens rice with seasoning.  the <mark>Carne Asada Burrito</mark> on the other had was awesome! the meat was so tender and flavorful. \n\noverall, i would probably not make the drive back to return for a meal. if in the area, maybe for happy hour which offers half off drinks and appetizer specials but the experience in a whole was a turnoff. i will stick with leticia's  mexican cucina in centennial hills which is always good.", 
            "what an incredible restaurant. \n\nmy family tends to seek out the best mexican restaurants wherever we are, and this is definitely it in las vegas. the location is definitely odd, but the inside is incredibly inviting.\n\nthe food is fantastic. from the different salsas to the <mark>Deep Fried Ice Cream</mark>, el dorado cantina has not disappointed me. i love the <mark>Carne Asada Burrito</mark>; i crave it. the steak is definitely the best out of chicken, shrimp, and steak, but they are all good. the chef regularly comes into the dining room to greet the guests, and he is incredibly friendly. it really makes dining here a special experience. \n\nthis is my idea of a hidden gem in vegas, and i certainly hope more people are able to discover it.", 
            "my family and i came here for dinner. we had heard awesome things about it and wanted to check it out. first off, if you're getting margaritas it is so worth it to get the pitcher. it serves four perfectly. the red sangria and el dorado margaritas are great. i had the carnitas street tacos for dinner. they were amazing. the rice is good too. i tried my husband's chicken enchiladas and they were amazing. the rest of my party tried the <mark>Carne Asada Burrito</mark>, beef enchiladas, and carne street tacos and really enjoyed it all. marco is an awesome waiter and takes great care of you! we were also pleasantly surprised that chef paco and the general manager stopped by our table to check on us. i definitely recommend and will definitely go back!", 
            "the best mexican food i have eaten here in town. <mark>Carne Asada Burrito</mark> is to die for as well as the flan. best ever. . you have to make it down and bring your friends.", 
            "ok. seriously. not kidding. the best <mark>Carne Asada Burrito</mark> i have ever eaten. hands down. the rice excellent. salsa amazing and they made the guacamole in front of us. tastee! my wife had enchiladas and she loves them. for me the enchiladas not quite as good as the burrito but hey the burrito was out of the park so i guess i am biased.", 
            "had an amazing experience with the whole family.  my sister and brother in law came to vegas from japan and my parents and i came from virginia.  we had been craving some mexican food and el dorado really delivered.  not only was the service really great, we also had a chance to meet and acquaint ourselves with executive chef paco.\n\nthe food was phenomenal.  we had the steak fajitas, the carnitas, and the <mark>Carne Asada Burrito</mark>.   all the margaritas were great ( i think we tried all the different flavors ).  my personal favorite was the jalape\\u00f1o flavored margarita.  for dessert, i highly recommend the flan.  according to chef paco, the flan's recipe is from his grandmother and you can really tell that the flan is a work of family love.\n\nwe had lunch and dinner there three times in the course of five days.  that's how much we enjoyed it.", 
            "place is great! chef came out and said hello! if you are a local hit this place up on mondays. i had the <mark>Carne Asada Burrito</mark> and it was one of the best burritos i have ever had. chef paco is the man!", 
            "man, what a great experience here. we checked in on yelp and got some free flan (which was amazing). chef paco did a great job. the <mark>Carne Asada Burrito</mark> was unreal. marc, our server was awesome and made sure we got the best service/deals. this is by far our favorite mexican spot now. lindo michoacan doesn't have anything over this place. come here.", 
            "unbelievable mexican cuisine, the <mark>Carne Asada Burrito</mark> is the best i've had in my life, hand made guacamole at the table was incredible as well!!!!", 
            "this place does not disappoint!! the waiter was super nice! the ambiance was good!! \n\nwe had the <mark>Carne Asada Burrito</mark> and shrimp tacos!! \nwow sooooooo good!! the rice is amazing! \ni also had the red sangria and was not disappointed!! \n\nhard to find as you have to park in the sapphire strip club parking lot and it basically right next to the front entrance of the strip club. but don't let that put you off!! \nin our entire stay is vegas this was our favorite place by far!!!! \n\nthe chief came out to meet us personally!! \n\ndon't hesitate to go to this place!!! \njust go!! we got our free flan and wow sooo goood!! \nthe chief even brought us out a cream strawberry dessert and even better if that's possible!!! \n\nthis was our 15 wedding anniversary and they didn't  know but made our last dinner in vegas so special!!\n\nthanks to chief paco!! \nyou made our night!!! \nyou guys killed it!!", 
            "don't really understand all the 5 star ratings as this food does not really taste better than a lot of the mexican food i've had in california. don't get me wrong, the food is good, just not good enough to justify the prices they are charging, i had the <mark>Carne Asada Burrito</mark> and it was good but definitely not better than the <mark>Carne Asada Burrito</mark> i get for half that price at the local alberto's behind my house! also thought the location of this place was a bit quirky as it shares its walls with the largest strip club in america. we had to pull over and ask a parking lot attendant where the restaurant was because the strip club was pretty much covering it up. service is good and at the end of the meal the chef came out and spoke to our party for a minute which was nice.", 
            "this isnt just a restaurant or a meal. its an experience! a great one at that. this place was an utter delight the second we walked in.the decor rivals anything any of the casinos can offer. we were seating promptly, with a smile, to a huge round booth.we felt truly welcomed immediately.\n\nthen our waitress came out beaming with positive energy and took our drink order. i ordered an <mark>Iced Tea</mark>, which was great, and in a big glass. wifey wanted water, as we had already had our fill of alcohol our short vegas jaunt.\n\nshe returned with chips that were purple, and served with 3 different types of salsa. we were warned about the spiciness of the orange habanero salsa, but it wasnt so bad. we enjoyed it. the salsa verde was good. but we devoured the delicious red salsa casera, which was quickly noticed and refilled. awesome.\n\nwe shared a chicken gordita plate as an appetizer. they came out smaller than we expected. no worries though, we enjoyed them. very good.\n\nwifey ordered the carne asada nachos. they came out with great presentation, and plenty of meat. all the fixins. they took nachos to another level. portion was big enough to share.\n\ni had a carna <mark>Carne Asada Burrito</mark>. i would place this burrito in the top 10 all-time <mark>Carne Asada Burrito</mark> ever. i found myself eating slowly to savor the goodness. fantastic.\n\nchef paco came out to greet us, and thank us for our patronage. we showered him with compliments and thanked him for making us such delectable food. what a nice, geniune hombre.\n\nwe recieved complimentary flan for checking in on my phone. my wife has hated flan since childhood, and reluctantly tried some. she loved it! because this is the worlds greatest flan! no joke, this is the best flan either of us have ever had bar none. if you try it, try to incorporate some of the mint leaf into your bite, it adds a little extra to the indulgence.\n\nthis restaurant has earned our loyalty, and we will be coming here every time we are in town. we rather enjoyed the adventure in finding this place, and dont mind the strip club next door. if you dont like strippers, you shouldnt be in las vegas.\n\nwell done guys", 
            "sat at the bar for a double date. had carnitas tacos with pineapple and a <mark>Carne Asada Burrito</mark>- delicious. \n\ni think the thing that topped it off was that the bartender was super professional and was just attentive enough to help without being annoying. the chef came out to check on us and asked for us to review - thanks chef paco, that was good.", 
            "had a great birthday dinner here while visiting vegas on june 16th. i'll start with the only thing i did not like...the table we were sat at was very dark. hard to even read our menu. other than that, i was very impressed! we were able to make a reservation on their website and easily change the time when we were delayed on making it to vegas at an earlier time. glad we made a reservation tho. it was busy when we got there at 8pm for our time slot!\n\nwe found this restaurant while looking up organic restaurants. i usually judge places (especially those claiming non-gmo or organic) by how i feel after eating. just full and content! did not feel sick or believe that they are claiming something they are not. the menu was extensive and descriptive. they even tell you what farms they get their meat from and where they source their dairy products!\n\nstarted with a huge margarita with organic muddled fruit in it. did strawberry and then blueberry. both were delicious. my bf had a really tasty organic beer. \n\nstarted with the veggie nachos, which were really tasty and a huge plate! probably didn't need more food after this, but since it was my birthday, we were splurging. ;-)\n\ni ordered the seafood enchiladas which had pacific wild shrimp, bay scallops & mahi. the sauce was a bit on the spicy side for me, but i know i'm just a wimp when it comes to spice! still really tasty and took half of it home. was even good heated up in our hotel microwave!\n\nmy bf ordered a <mark>Carne Asada Burrito</mark> and he loved every bite! he managed to eat it all at the restaurant. \n\nended with the churros, which was a nice sweet ending, even though i was so full!\n\nour waiter, joaquin (i believe this is the right spelling), was extremely friendly and more than happy to answer any questions we had about things to do in vegas. found out we were in town for edc and shared the same interests so we had a good time chatting with him during our dinner. quick and friendly service. \n\ni will definitely return and recommend this place highly!", 
            "a buddy invited me here for lunch and when he told me it was in saphire i thought i was getting the $5 all you can eat taco and tits special.  to my dismay there were no boobies, but the food was awesome!  we shared a <mark>Carne Asada Burrito</mark> that was off the hook and some chicken enchiladas that were good, but not as good as the carne asada.  i would highly reccomend this place when you are near the strip, but don't want to deal with going to a hotel.  this place also a really cool vibe a good drink menu.", 
            "you have to try the <mark>Carne Asada Burrito</mark>. it's $15 but damn it's worth every cent. open 24 hours and really quick service.", 
            "this place is amazing. my husband and i are travelling from texas and have yet to come across an authentic mexican restaurant that serves clean organic non gmo dishes. even the desserts are clean. i ordered the <mark>Carne Asada Burrito</mark> with green sauce and goodness it was tasty! we live very close to the mexican border and this food tasted like home. so happy to have found this place and wish we had one back in south texas.", 
            "if i could eat here everyday, i would be so happy! where to even begin?\n\nevery time i come here, i always start with a blackberry margarita. ingredients are so fresh with a great kick of tequila. their chips comes with three types of salsa - mild, verse and hot (the hot is habanero so take little dips on that one) as well as beans. you could snack on those for hours!\n\nnow to the fun part, the entrees. i highly recommend the <mark>Carne Asada Burrito</mark>. seriously, it will give you life! it's packed with amazing steak, rice, black beans and guac, all rolled up in a beautiful tortilla. it also comes with a side of cilantro rice. i'm not a huge fan of cilantro but it was definitely good.\n\ni have also tried their street-style tacos and their fajitas are huge. all made with the freshest ingredients!\n\nmake sure to say hello to chef paco as he likes to make his rounds and say hello to his guests.\n\nseriously, one of the best places in vegas - hands down! :)", 
            "what i've learned being in las vegas: everything is about 50% more expensive here. carnitas plate? $22. <mark>Carne Asada Burrito</mark>? $18.\n\nso pricing aside, the cantina is a great restaurant. nice ambiance for drinks and mexican food. and they actually serve mexican corn. yum. don't think about how it is 3x the cost of getting it on the street in chicago or oakland. i said don't think about it. \n\njust enjoy your tasty tacos with your large margarita. they are a margarita bar so don't miss out! and they make up for the pricey-ness of the food with generous glasses of alcohol.", 
            "umm... i swear i'm not ubering to a strip club. i'm only ubering to the non-gmo & organic mexican restaurant inside it...\n\neverything at el dorado was delicious and definitely order the $14 guacamole.\n\nmaybe that sounds crazy and yes you can make it at home, but it's a live demonstration of fresh guac to your table. \n\nbest. guac. i've. ever. had.\n\ni also had a shrimp bowl, which was healthy and flavorful. i had a bite of the <mark>Carne Asada Burrito</mark> and didn't skimp out on the meat (use their habanero sauce, burns so good).\n\nfree custardy flan with a check-in. open 24 hours.", 
            "stop reading reviews and just go!!!! hands down the best mexican food we've ever had at a restaurant! please open up a location in la!! the fact that it's organic and non-gmo is what makes this place a gem...we honestly wouldn't have gone if that wasn't the case. the location is next to a gentlemens club with the same parking but it has its own entrance and it's honestly not that big of a deal. our server was amber and she rocked it! gave us good recommendations that weren't your standard \"this is popular bs\" that a lot of servers do to push certain items. she checked on us often and made sure we had everything we needed. we ordered the <mark>Carne Asada Burrito</mark> and 3 tacos ( al pastor, chicken, and cochinita). the burrito was absolutely phenomenal. the beef was so tender i though i was eating short ribs! the tacos were all really good too but cochinita was the star! i also ordered the strawberry margarita was which so good and so much! it's practically a fish bowl drink and it's not full of unnatural simple syrup or triple sec. everything but tequila is organic in that sucker and they're even working on getting organic tequila too. we then met chef paco when we got our yelp flan (which is no small portion) and he told us about his grandmas authentic recipes and the importance of organic ingredients. it's no wonder that the food, especially the meat, is so tasty! we will definitely be back every time we come to vegas!!", 
            "this place was off the hook! started with the table side guac, huge portion! so worth it, lots of flavor, not bland like most places, makes me want to get it over and over! the service was awesome, price is a little high but you pay for what you get and boy do you get a lot! the taste, the flavors, i can't wait to go back again! definitely a place to try different things each time. i got the <mark>Carne Asada Burrito</mark>, should call it a taste of heaven in your mouth! the rice on the side was so good! i would come back alone just for the rice, cooked perfectly!!! only downside i would say is that it's attached to a gentlemans club, but it's alright, the food was amazing!", 
            "mango jalape\\u00f1o margaritas made by the best bartender at el darado raffi are a must ...he has a sparkling personality  !! chef paco killing it with the <mark>Carne Asada Burrito</mark>. and kai the other bartender is tall dark and handsome &):)&\"$(?&(;)&8):)&536864)$87",

            "definitely the best mexican restaurant not only in las vegas but in the us. chef paco really knows how to make your palate go wild. the perfect mix of flavors in every dish. must try the tableside guacamole, the carnes <mark>Carne Asada Burrito</mark>, and the flan.... to die for. out server enrique was very nice and his service outstanding. he even brought chef paco out to meet us. if you are in las vegas, you have to, must go to el dorado cantina!!!"

            "short review : go! you won't be sorry. it's fabulous. directly next to sapphire strip club, so you have to actually park in their lot and walk towards that door, and then you will see the door for el dorado to the left. it was slightly confusing for us at first, but we are so glad we went, and you will be too!\n\nlong review: \n\nwe ended up here because of the good yelp reviews. had a little trouble finding it, but i'm so glad we did. very cozy inside, kind of dark, nice big booths, great atmosphere. \n\nstarted with a jalapeno margarita, which was to die for if you like spicy. it was hot, and also huge, so totally worth the $13 price tag, imo. i also loved the green salsa that came with the chips and trio of salsas...that was super yummy and my favorite of the three for sure. \n\nhubby had beef enchiladas, which he devoured. he did say they were slightly sweet, which was different for him, but he still really liked them. he also loved the rice, which also came with my order and was delicious! i've never tasted anything like it! sooooooo good!\n\ni had the <mark>Veggie Burrito</mark>, which was just fantastic. veggies cooked to perfection and all the flavors blended together so well. the best <mark>Veggie Burrito</mark> i have ever had for sure. and again, the rice, oh my goodness, so good!\n\nthe service was very good, and, what i am assuming were, two managers came to check on us and were constantly walking around checking on people. also, i overheard one of them being questioned about combining items on the menu and she broke down the a la carte prices and said we can put it together however you would prefer to make you happy. i thought that was great. we were also next to a table of 8, and the waiter asked how they would like to break up the check and they wanted 4 checks (2 people each) and he was very nice and accommodating about that, which again, i thought was great service. \n\ni ended up checking in on yelp (first time!) because there was a free flan offer even though we are not big fans of flan and were already pretty full, but i am so glad i did because it was awesome!! so delicious, and i found some room for it after all ;-)\n\na very well deserved 5 star review. great prices, great service, fantastic food! i can't wait to go back!", 
            "wow!  best mexican we've had in a long time. \nwe had a <mark>Veggie Burrito</mark> and some street tacos.   forget what your chain mexican food this is the real deal.    be aware this place is tucked behind circus circus and attached to a gentlemans club.  you might want to drive here if it's dark out", 
            "we had the <mark>Veggie Burrito</mark> and veggie taco both were very fresh and delicious! our service was also awesome! can't wait to go back!", 
            "our waiter (white guy, sorry forgot your name while drunk!) was super friendly and attentive. gave us check in for a free dessert for a flan, which was super bomb.\n\nhard to find entry next to strip club, but we walked from circus circus and we're sat immediately on a friday night. boyfriend and i split a <mark>Veggie Burrito</mark> which was very filling combined with free table chips and three kinds of salsa. would return! three stars because parking lot was filled with taxis and strip club people were very rude at entry", 
            "i think it's genius that this place is literally right next to a 24 hour; famous, strip club. the food was definitely high quality, which i always appreciate. our waitress who was also our bar side guacamole maker was very knowledgeable about this restaurant and even gave us information we never knew about, which is always a plus because we're locals. and we love to eat!  25% off of menu for locals on mondays. yes, all day! another plus about this place is that they were able to accommodate my vegan diet. the manager even stated, \" i'll make the whole thing vegan, even the rice. it will be with brown rice instead, because our cilantro rice has butter.\"  i love it! my <mark>Veggie Burrito</mark> made vegan was ok. i didn't like that it had big chunks of squash and zucchini, it kinda over powered the burrito. but i ate half  \ni don't think i saw a vegan selection for desert. but don't quote me to that because i don't recall looking thoroughly. overall; yes, i would come here again, maybe this monday", 
            "i loved the food here, i'm a vegetarian and enjoyed the  <mark>Veggie Burrito</mark>, veg taco and the flan.. we loved every bite.. they use organic veggies. the ambience is good and service friendly. they offer free tortillas n salsa for appetizers and fill it unlimited. given the organic ingredients it is reasonably priced. we look forward to them opening a store in denver, colorado."

            "we found this place via a friend on facebook who came here and said on fb it was gmo free and the food was amazing.  as usual, i went onto yelp and a majority of the reviews were 5 stars but if you go a ways down you will find some 4's and below.  we decided to try this place for lunch today because of the hype on gmo free, organic and amazing.  since others have mentioned the excellent servers they have had let me tell you about our server victor.  it took him a long time to get to our table, good thing for the hostess as she got us our drinks and took our appetizer order.  victor finally came and proceeded to go over the entire menu trying to sell us on everything that were his favorites which seemed to be everything but this place still has not had its grand opening.  \n\ni don't want to be sold on food, let me try it and give my opinion.  he seemed really off today and later you will understand why.  he brought out our appetizer, tostaditas de tinga's, 3 small tostada's with white meat chicken and sauce.  when he got to the table, he dumped one of the tostada's on my wife...he was very apologetic and cleaned it up quickly and brought us a new order on the house.  he also tried to explain being off on his sick daughter from the day before but then we heard him tell the table next to us that he had been next door at the sapphire club all night.  by the way, this is the same building as  the sapphire gentlemen's club, the same parking lot and the same owners...\n\nchef paco who everyone talked about in their reviews obviously was not here today.  our appetizer lacked in seasoning, all white meat chicken boiled and not like what you would find in mexico.  we had the table side guacamole which was pretty good, but the carne asada taco's and the al pastor taco's lacked in taste as well compared to the authentic foods of mexico.  the rice was white rice with no seasoning at all, very bland.  the beans tasted like canned beans, which brings up a funny story...our waiter first said the beans were from a can but then came back and said he talked to one of the cooks who said they were not canned, they were made in house daily.  not...\n\nthe flan was good but did not seem like home made daily like they claim.  any chicken dish from the tostada's to the <mark>Pulled Chicken Burrito</mark> i brought my daughter was very bland.  needless to say we were very disappointed as we were hoping for an amazing meal, gmo free and organic however the corn tortillas did not taste like fresh corn tortillas.    \n\nthis is not a place we will go back to as you can find better tasting authentic mexican food about anywhere in town.  i am sure chef paco is an amazing person but whether he is there or not, the menu items should always be cooked the same way and if they were going for what you would find in mexico, the mark was really missed here.", 
            "excellent food, great service, and chef paco is super nice! i had the pineapple shrimp which is served inside of a half pineapple. it was juicy and spicy, exactly how i like it. hubby had the <mark>Pulled Chicken Burrito</mark> which was crunchy and perfectly seasoned. the cilantro rice is also really good. don't forget the churros in the end! amazing! def coming back! :)))",

none of this an issue when taking a look at plate two, each overstuffed burrito amongst the best i've tasted in recent memory while taquitos were light and greaseless, the chicken quesadilla also quite special with onions adding a smoky, aromatic punch.\n\nadmittedly full, to the point where a solid meal or two's worth of food was boxed up to go, it was still without hesitation that dessert was ordered and although the boozy tres leches was quite excellent beneath whipped cream <mark>Steak <mark>Chicken <mark><mark>Chicken Steak and Shrimp Combo Fajita Platter <mark>Chicken Feinstein <mark>Siegel <mark>Yemenidjian Taco Plate <mark>Steak <mark>Chicken <mark>Shrimp <mark>Veggie Bowl <mark>Chipotle Chicken <mark>Carne Asada <mark>Pork Carnitas <mark>Cochinita Pibil <mark>Cilantro Garlic Shrimp <mark>Cedar Chipotle Salmon <mark>Pineapple Shrimp <mark>Tropical Mahi <mark>Mexican Corn <mark>Seasonal Veggies Gluten Free</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark> fruit it was chef paco's ancient flan recipe that stole my heart, the texture far more thick than many would associate with the dish, but each caramel tinged bite proving as good as the last until each plate was clean, the chef himself standing tableside and offering gifts from a care packaged straight from mexico while discussing his passion for cooking as the meal reached an end.\n\norganic + non-gmo + 24/7 + authentic mexican food + next to a strip club = an equation only las vegas could dream up, and like many things in this fabulous city it works like a charm.",

            "wow!!  amazing food - super fresh - everyone in our party loved it.  we order the mexican chili as an app - super tasty.  i has the <mark>Pulled Chicken Burrito</mark>, which was out of this world.  will definitely go back next time i'm in vegas", 
            "food was sub par at best, but the service was not even remotely close to acceptable.  we came here on our 2nd night in las vegas and had read rave reviews about this place. we had made a reservation for 7:00 for 3 people on  a friday night, but we weren't able to locate the restaurant since it's located right in/next to sapphire night club. not an ideal location i'd want to go to for a restaurant, but hey it's vegas fine whatever. their parking lot is a disaster, good luck trying to get any direction or assistance with parking in that beat up flea market lot... and after all that hassle we finally manage to make it into the restaurant 20 minutes past 7:00. we apologize for our late arrival, but we had a reservation. i'm not even sure if the host had his mouth wired shut or he was just that much of a rude person but rolled his eyes and tried to mumble something t.....as if it was a problem...... there were 5 booths open. wasn't even a busy night by the looks of it. we were greeted promptly by our waited, took our drink orders, returned with chips and salsa... standard fare for mexican places, nothing exciting. my fiance ordered a <mark>Carnitas Rajas Burrito</mark>, my mother ordered tacos, and i a <mark>Pulled Chicken Burrito</mark>....and then we were left staring at the our phones as the time ticked by....it took nearly an hour to bring out three burritos. prior to their arrival however 30  minutes in our server claimed our food was coming out soon, then a few minutes later the manager asks us if we need anything... we look around and nod, yes we still need our food? after this mind you, few more people have arrived and had had their orders taken, and food has arrived at their table. now, i honestly don't think our meal took that much preparation, maybe for enchiladas or something of that nature but really, two burritos and tacos? finally the manager brings out our food, which is luke warm by now does not offer an apology for the delay. burrito tasted like something i could've made at home, in less time and tasted better. my fiance and mother seemed satisfied with their choices, but nothing extraordinary. ive honestly had better tasting food at hole in the wall places than this so called upscale mexican place. after all that mess it took forever to get the check, and even longer to get the receipt and go. maybe this place has more charm when you're there for the liquor and not a meal.\n\nmind you what really bothered me the most about this place was lack of customer service for all guests. two girls from the club next to this place barely stepped in before they were whisked to a table behind us, drink orders taken before they even sat down, and their food was brought to them before ours was and we'd been waiting almost an hour. ridiculous. not a single apology was made about this delay.\n\nand to add to this whole issue, we made reservations through open table, and they flagged us for no shows and had to dispute that as well. never coming back to this place.",

            "sharing property with a freaking sapphire's strip club, we initially drove passed this place. not the most family friendly of locations, but we gave it shot as it was just me and my wife. stepping in right around 5:30 p.m., we were seated without any wait. a quick look through the menu we quickly noticed some inflated prices, both with the food and drinks. i suppose it's to be expected in las vegas, but their off-strip location would suggest otherwise. chips and salsa came out in due time, and we ordered the tableside guacamole after reading the rave reviews. the guac was flat out spectacular; a huge offering, perfectly seasoned, fresh ingredients, and definitely one of the best i've ever had. with the complimentary chips, salsa, an order of guacamole, and a pitcher of perfect margarita, we were near full, and ended up splitting a <mark>Carnitas Rajas Burrito</mark>. the burrito came out already cut in half, and strangely enough some differences were noticed. my half was scalding hot, an obvious microwave job. my wife's came out luke warm, and almost seemed to be prepared differently. we almost questioned whether or not they cut our burrito and someone else's, swapped halves, and sent them out. either way, my half was solid. quality ingredients, excellently seasoned, tasty carnitas...my complaints would be they didn't use a burrito tortilla...more of a wrap, and it was microwaved until scalding. hard to deny the flavor, and some of the quality food and drink we enjoyed. bottom line, keep the kids at home, bring your appetite and checkbook. solid mexican food a bit off the beaten path.", 
            "food was sub par at best, but the service was not even remotely close to acceptable.  we came here on our 2nd night in las vegas and had read rave reviews about this place. we had made a reservation for 7:00 for 3 people on  a friday night, but we weren't able to locate the restaurant since it's located right in/next to sapphire night club. not an ideal location i'd want to go to for a restaurant, but hey it's vegas fine whatever. their parking lot is a disaster, good luck trying to get any direction or assistance with parking in that beat up flea market lot... and after all that hassle we finally manage to make it into the restaurant 20 minutes past 7:00. we apologize for our late arrival, but we had a reservation. i'm not even sure if the host had his mouth wired shut or he was just that much of a rude person but rolled his eyes and tried to mumble something t.....as if it was a problem...... there were 5 booths open. wasn't even a busy night by the looks of it. we were greeted promptly by our waited, took our drink orders, returned with chips and salsa... standard fare for mexican places, nothing exciting. my fiance ordered a <mark>Carnitas Rajas Burrito</mark>, my mother ordered tacos, and i a <mark>Pulled Chicken Burrito</mark>....and then we were left staring at the our phones as the time ticked by....it took nearly an hour to bring out three burritos. prior to their arrival however 30  minutes in our server claimed our food was coming out soon, then a few minutes later the manager asks us if we need anything... we look around and nod, yes we still need our food? after this mind you, few more people have arrived and had had their orders taken, and food has arrived at their table. now, i honestly don't think our meal took that much preparation, maybe for enchiladas or something of that nature but really, two burritos and tacos? finally the manager brings out our food, which is luke warm by now does not offer an apology for the delay. burrito tasted like something i could've made at home, in less time and tasted better. my fiance and mother seemed satisfied with their choices, but nothing extraordinary. ive honestly had better tasting food at hole in the wall places than this so called upscale mexican place. after all that mess it took forever to get the check, and even longer to get the receipt and go. maybe this place has more charm when you're there for the liquor and not a meal.\n\nmind you what really bothered me the most about this place was lack of customer service for all guests. two girls from the club next to this place barely stepped in before they were whisked to a table behind us, drink orders taken before they even sat down, and their food was brought to them before ours was and we'd been waiting almost an hour. ridiculous. not a single apology was made about this delay.\n\nand to add to this whole issue, we made reservations through open table, and they flagged us for no shows and had to dispute that as well. never coming back to this place.", 
            "a hidden gem close to the strip. our first time here. the best <mark>Carnitas Rajas Burrito</mark> i've had. the meat is tender and full of flavor. had a taste of the street carne asada tacos too. our server enrique made the visit even better.", 
            "excellent, food & service. the queso fundido with mushrooms is one of my favorites, <mark>Carnitas Rajas Burrito</mark> was delicious.", 
            "yes! finally some solid mexican food restaurants. the location is deceiving, so when you are pulling up off of industrial you will pull into the parking lot for sapphires. my husband and i circled around several times until we pulled in to what appears sapphire's parking lot, and spotted that there was an entrance and a somewhat hidden/obstructed sign next to the entrance to the strip club.\n\nwe were pleasantly surprised by the decor and the classy vibe inside of the restaurant. there were comfortable booths and tables, along with a nice bar area which seemed packed. it seems to be a hot spot for younger, professional looking crowd and i can see why. the ambiance, service and the food would prompt me to take a client here for lunch.\n\nthey have a pretty extensive cocktail menu which i did not really go over. the server mentioned that their margaritas are not made with any pre made mixes and is sweetened with agave nectar and was offered in several flavors. i went with the raspberry flavor per his suggestion. i enjoyed it, although still felt it was a bit sweet and the raspberry chunks kept clogging up my straw which got to be annoying. get wider straws if you are putting chunks for fruit into the drink. overall, i could taste the difference but i just wasn't in the mood to drink so i couldn't recommend this place based on the cocktail alone.\n\nthe chips (first round is complimentary) are decent, but nothing like what some people are raving about. i found them to be an unnecessary filler.\n\nwe ordered the carne asada, <mark>Carnitas Rajas Burrito</mark> enchilada style in red sauce (choice of red of green) and al pastor tacos (comes in a set of 3, you can mix and match the flavors). the carne asada and the burrito were extremely delicious. they were served with cilantro rice that was so light, yet packed with flavor. i seriously could just eat the rice alone there and be happy. the meat was high quality with great portions. the burrito was filling, but given the nature of the ingredients it did not leave me feeling stuffed, instead i felt satiated and full. the tacos were not impressive to me because the al pastor tasted dry and i had to use one of the left over salsas from the chips to pour over them. i am accustomed to juicy and flavorful al pastor and this just did not deliver. it tasted as if it was under a heat lamp for a bit too long.\n\nthe prices are not cheap, but you do get what you pay for. the burrito was around $16 and the carne asada around $25. the service was attentive and pleasant. overall we felt it was money well spent and intend on coming back soon to sample more of their menu.", 
            "my last outing here was fine on the whole, but there were some discordant notes.  \n\ntableside guac was very good but noticeably salty, while albondigas soup was excellent, with savory meatballs standing out in a hot vegetable-oriented broth.  although <mark>Imperial Shrimp</mark> wrapped in bacon and lightly fried was a good starter, i believe the dish would taste better without the fish stuffing.  \n\nmy main of a slow cooked <mark>Carnitas Rajas Burrito</mark>, packed with marinated pork and cilantro rice, roasted peppers, refried beans, fresh guacamole, a mexican blend of three cheeses, and avocado salsa in a warm flour tortilla, featured tender carnitas and was both filling and satisfying.  but i would have liked more pico de gallo and a saucier burrito.  and a mound of cilantro rice on the side, outside the burrito, seemed superfluous.  \n\nseating was comfortable but there was not a heavy server presence, and the waiters who attended our table kept switching.   at meal's end i had to ask two different servers for the check, and the men's restroom was messy.  nevertheless, because the food here is noticeably fresh, clean, and composed of high quality ingredients, and is available 24 hours, el dorado cantina is an asset to the las vegas mexican cuisine dining scene, and worth another look.\n\n3-1/2 stars overall on this visit."

            "for my first visit to el dorado, i awarded it 5 stars.  can't get better than that, right?  wrong!  it's even better when you're local and you go on monday night, when the entire bill is 50% off.  i should have saved the 5th star for this update, because i can't give it 6.  \n\nit didn't occur to me to make a reservation, because i thought that if we go after 8 p.m., the after-work crowd would have made getting a table a cinch.  wrong again.  life's nothing but a learning experience.\n\nso we did manage to snag two seats at the bar (also not an easy task), and were more than ably attended to by ashley.  okay, so i didn't get to practice my spanish, small price to pay for the excellent, friendly, and patient service.  but i did get to drink one helluva margarita, while mr. g stuck with the sangria, same as last time.  only problem is that i'm too short to reach the drinking end of a stemmed glass while sitting at the bar; they just have to raise those stools or find me a booster seat. \n\nwe changed it up a bit this time, sharing the chicken feinstein once again, because we do love our carbs and fried onions.  the thinly sliced fried potatoes evoke fond memories of our favorite late great spanish restaurant in new jersey, and we love the fried eggs on top.  we took home enough for me to throw two eggs on top of the leftovers the next night, add a salad, and call it dinner for two.  \n\nwe also shared paco'<mark>Paco s Mole Sampler</mark>.  paco's the chef, and this dish shows off three distinct moles of mexican cuisine: the most familiar dark, rich, chocolatey oaxacan mole, the pungent chile poblano mole, enriched with pumpkin seeds, and the guajillo chile mole, a bit spicier and smokier.  all three were superb, and enhanced by the delicious cilantro rice accompanying them. \n\nafter two visits (and craving a third), this will be our go-to place for all the friends and relatives who visit from out of town, as long as they make it a long weekend. they can take the red-eye home on monday night and we'll have a shorter trip to take them back to the airport.\n\nviva el dorado!",

            "for the most part, having a couple dishes and one visit usually isn't enough to truly evaluate a restaurant as a whole, but that's all i needed. we were aided with a spectacular server that help choose perfect dishes for us and provided top notch service. i knew this place was on another level from the time we sat down and had chips with salsas that had a different flavor compared to others. to me, there was just a little extra boost of flavor or heat with every dish that had us nodding our heads after every bite.\n\nchris, our server, was the difference maker. he greeted us immediately, was always present throughout our monday night meal, and had knowledge of the menu because he's tasted all the items on the menu. he was able to describe each and every flavor in each dish which made everything that much more appetizing. he had recommendations with every aspect of the meal such as suggesting refried beans versus black for a side and making sure my friend ordered his burrito enchilada style versus dry. when i was unsure what i wanted to order, he interjected, \"paco'<mark>Paco s Mole Sampler</mark>\" before i could finish my sentence asking what his suggestions were.\n\nto start, we had a vertical flight of patron (my choice, not chris's) and the recommended tostaditas de tinga which is pretty simple, but a delicious tostada elevated with some heat from the chipotle marinated chicken and the salsa cascabel. the flight with sangrita was definitely a nice sampling of tequila as i'm a fan of patron, but the tequilas really didn't pair well any of the food and just added to my inebriated state. i think a margarita would have been a better pairing with my food and the only thing that i would have changed. in fact, i'm going to make a margarita for myself right now to make up for my poor choice.\n\nalthough we didn't get to speak with chef paco because our 10 pm arrival may have been too late, the <mark>Paco s Mole Sampler</mark> was a nice representation of him and his food. i'm no expert on moles and haven't had many in my life, but i do know it's a painstaking, lengthy process to make in which you have to empty the kitchen pantry and spice rack. i also know these chicken moles, although quite different and distinct in flavor, were fantastic. the guajillo chipotle chile was my favorite mole with a brighter flavor that had me sweating like a mad man.\n\nthe mole, the clean <mark>Steak <mark>Chicken <mark><mark>Chicken Steak and Shrimp Combo Fajita Platter <mark>Chicken Feinstein <mark>Siegel <mark>Yemenidjian Taco Plate <mark>Steak <mark>Chicken <mark>Shrimp <mark>Veggie Bowl <mark>Chipotle Chicken <mark>Carne Asada <mark>Pork Carnitas <mark>Cochinita Pibil <mark>Cilantro Garlic Shrimp <mark>Cedar Chipotle Salmon <mark>Pineapple Shrimp <mark>Tropical Mahi <mark>Mexican Corn <mark>Seasonal Veggies Gluten Free</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark> product, the 25% discount for locals on monday night, the free flan with yelp check in, and the outstanding service makes el dorado as good as it gets. i'll be back with hopes that this wasn't just a one time experience, but i'll put some money down that it wasn't."

none of this an issue when taking a look at plate two, each overstuffed burrito amongst the best i've tasted in recent memory while taquitos were light and greaseless, the chicken quesadilla also quite special with onions adding a smoky, aromatic punch.\n\nadmittedly full, to the point where a solid meal or two's worth of food was boxed up to go, it was still without hesitation that dessert was ordered and although the boozy tres leches was quite excellent beneath whipped cream <mark>Steak <mark>Chicken <mark><mark>Chicken Steak and Shrimp Combo Fajita Platter <mark>Chicken Feinstein <mark>Siegel <mark>Yemenidjian Taco Plate <mark>Steak <mark>Chicken <mark>Shrimp <mark>Veggie Bowl <mark>Chipotle Chicken <mark>Carne Asada <mark>Pork Carnitas <mark>Cochinita Pibil <mark>Cilantro Garlic Shrimp <mark>Cedar Chipotle Salmon <mark>Pineapple Shrimp <mark>Tropical Mahi <mark>Mexican Corn <mark>Seasonal Veggies Gluten Free</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark> fruit it was chef paco's ancient flan recipe that stole my heart, the texture far more thick than many would associate with the dish, but each caramel tinged bite proving as good as the last until each plate was clean, the chef himself standing tableside and offering gifts from a care packaged straight from mexico while discussing his passion for cooking as the meal reached an end.\n\norganic + non-gmo + 24/7 + authentic mexican food + next to a strip club = an equation only las vegas could dream up, and like many things in this fabulous city it works like a charm.",

damn you good tasting chips and salsa! also, damn you servers who are constantly walking by refilling the chips and salsa! we both agreed to share a meal since we definitely overdid it on the chips.\n\nwhat we ordered was the the steak n chicken mixed fajita platter ($25). it has sliced green, red, and yellow bell peppers along with sliced onions. the shrimp were some pretty sized good chunks. the cut up pieces of steak were tender and very juicy. if you just sat down and get a whiff of this dish as the server walks by you, that alone will pretty much entice you to order it. comes with a plate of sour cream, guacamole, pico de gallo, and your choice of black or refried beans. you also get either flour or corn tortillas. im glad we shared it for we barely finished it! we finished up with a free flan as the special for checking in on yelp. for you peeps with a sweet tooth, this dessert is rich.\n\nour second visit we decided to go on a monday to take advantage of the locals 50 percent off on the entire menu. we were strongly recommended to make a reservation for you just might wait awhile before a table opens up.\n\nas we showed up for our 7 pm reservation, the place was packed! people were waiting to be seated but not us. we proceeded to our table right away. we wanted to try different things so being the carnivore that i am, i went with the carne asada plate ($26) and wifey went with the conchinita pibill ($24). i was also curious about the mexican corn ($5) so we got that as well. for dessert, we got the flan ($8).\n\nthis time we kind of went easy on the chips and salsa so we can make a dent in our individual meals. again, we were wrong. we could of shared just one meal and still be fully satisfied. oh well, my oldest son could not have been happier when we brought home the leftovers!\n\nthe carne asada they give you 2, that's right, two nicely sized marinated skirt steaks. comes with a scoop of some type of steamed buttered rice (no, its not like rice pilaf) guacomole, and your choice of refried or black beans. but wait, there's more. you also get a grilled jalapeno and another grilled type of red pepper. they even give you some kind of pork sausage as well. the steak i requested medium rare and it was spot on! it was perfectly seasoned with whatever marinade they use. i can even taste a hint of lime in it. it is some of the best asada i have had in a long time.\n\nthe conchinita pibill was highly recommended by our server amber. she said it was one of favorite pork dishes. it is basically carnitas but with some different spices. it was so tender and juicy that i was alternating from my plate to hers.\n\nthe mexican corn (elote), is a roasted corn on the cobb coated with mayonaise, <mark>Queso Fundido <mark>Tostaditas de Tinga <mark>Mexican Shrimp Cocktail <mark>Pozole <mark>Albondigas Soup <mark>Mexican Chili <mark>Carnitas <mark>Al Pastor <mark>Carne Asada <mark>Pulled Chicken <mark>Cochinita Taco <mark>Corn Rajas Tacos <mark>Grilled Mahi <mark>Veggie <mark>Shrimp Taco <mark>Lettuce Wraps <mark>Cheese <mark>Chicken <mark>Beef <mark>Seafood Enchiladas <mark>SunFed Ranch Organic Grilled Steak <mark>Mary s Free Range Organic Chicken <mark>Grilled Wild Pacific Shrimp <mark>Steak <mark>Chicken <mark><mark>Chicken Steak and Shrimp Combo Fajita Platter <mark>Chicken Feinstein <mark>Siegel <mark>Yemenidjian Taco Plate <mark>Steak <mark>Chicken <mark>Shrimp <mark>Veggie Bowl <mark>Chipotle Chicken <mark>Carne Asada <mark>Pork Carnitas <mark>Cochinita Pibil <mark>Cilantro Garlic Shrimp <mark>Cedar Chipotle Salmon <mark>Pineapple Shrimp <mark>Tropical Mahi <mark>Mexican Corn <mark>Seasonal Veggies Gluten Free</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark>, and sprinkle of cayenne powder. comes with a couple of slices of lime for you to squeeze on to it.\n\nto complete our meal we got the flan again since we know that it is very good. now remember this second visit we only paid 35 dollars instead of 70 and we still had plenty of leftovers\n\nservice. as luck would have it, we ended up getting the same server as last time which was amber. now she is very efficient. not only does she serve other tables, but she is always looking at our table to see if we needed anything that was commonly asked. she did this every time she walked by carrying other customers' orders. all her other co-servers did their part by picking up empty plates as they walked by. not once did i ask for a refill on our waters and <mark>Soda</mark> at all both visits. now that is great service.\n\nsome random useful info. besides what i mentioned above, they are 24 hours, they have numerous gmo free and organic menu options not to mention <mark>Empanadas <mark>Sopes <mark>Beef <mark>Chicken <mark>Shrimp Taquitos <mark>Aguachiles <mark>El Dorado Nachos <mark>Queso Fundido <mark>Tostaditas de Tinga <mark>Mexican Shrimp Cocktail <mark>Pozole <mark>Albondigas Soup <mark>Mexican Chili <mark>Carnitas <mark>Al Pastor <mark>Carne Asada <mark>Pulled Chicken <mark>Cochinita Taco <mark>Corn Rajas Tacos <mark>Grilled Mahi <mark>Veggie <mark>Shrimp Taco <mark>Lettuce Wraps <mark>Cheese <mark>Chicken <mark>Beef <mark>Seafood Enchiladas <mark>SunFed Ranch Organic Grilled Steak <mark>Mary s Free Range Organic Chicken <mark>Grilled Wild Pacific Shrimp <mark>Steak <mark>Chicken <mark><mark>Chicken Steak and Shrimp Combo Fajita Platter <mark>Chicken Feinstein <mark>Siegel <mark>Yemenidjian Taco Plate <mark>Steak <mark>Chicken <mark>Shrimp <mark>Veggie Bowl <mark>Chipotle Chicken <mark>Carne Asada <mark>Pork Carnitas <mark>Cochinita Pibil <mark>Cilantro Garlic Shrimp <mark>Cedar Chipotle Salmon <mark>Pineapple Shrimp <mark>Tropical Mahi <mark>Mexican Corn <mark>Seasonal Veggies Gluten Free</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark> and organic items as well. oh, did i mention that they are right next to sapphire, one of largest strip clubs in vegas? guys (and gals) how many times have you gone to a strip club but had to leave later on because you were starving? yeah, i know makin it rain on them strippers makes me hungry too. just do the hokey pokey and turn yourself around. just like that you are feasting on great mexican food no matter what time of day it is. they even have giant flat screen tv's strewn all around the restaurant so you dont miss the \"big\" game if it so applies. sometimes, the master chef paco will be walking around making sure everything is ok. dude is very friendly.\n\nin closing, even though they opened just last year, i am still mad at myself for not checking them out sooner. i cant wait for my next meal here and i will definitely let other foodies know!

            "we were out of towers and wanted mexican food. this place is awesome! great food and great service! they tended to our big group of 7 with great attentiveness.   the gm and the chef came out to greet, welcome, and occasionally checked on how we were doing! we had the special between 3-6pm...street tacos. had the different kinds and all were great! we also tried the watermelon infused drink/water & the beef taquitos as an appetizer. delish! as for desserts,  we had the churros, <mark>Deep Fried Ice Cream</mark>, and flan. mouth watering!\n\na must try for sure!\n\nwe did drive past it since it's a lil tucked away. it's beside a gentlemen's club.", 
            "excellent experience! the atmosphere is very cozy and chic. the staff was welcoming and friendly from the moment we walked in.  overall, the service was excellent.  to start off, the chips and salsa were great (some of the best chips i've had) and we loved all three options of salsa that were given with the chips. \n\nwe decided to order the feast so we could get a little taste of everything.  while we loved the pork burrito, the steak burrito was also a huge hit. whatever the steak is marinated in is perfect. we also took advantage of yelp's check-in offer and tried a free carne asada taco that was excellent. everything tasted very fresh. \n\nfor dessert, we tried the <mark>Deep Fried Ice Cream</mark> and the churros. the churros are filled with caramel- come on!! delicious!\n\nwe would definitely recommended el dorado cantina and will be back on our next vegas trip!", 
            "a new modern twist to mexican food in las vegas. finally i have found a restaurant that serves non gmo foods!\n\ni have been disappointed in the quality of mexican restaurants that we have in las vegas. usually if you want good mexican food, you have to go to california. \n\nthis restaurant takes the cake. probably one of the best mexican restaurants in vegas. \n\nwe ordered the table side guacamole, carne asada and carnitas street tacos, chicken enchilada,  and <mark>Deep Fried Ice Cream</mark>. \n\nwow. foodgasm heaven! i still am thinking about the <mark>Deep Fried Ice Cream</mark>... lol. \n\neverything wa<mark>Mary s Free Range Organic Chicken <mark>Grilled Wild Pacific Shrimp <mark>Steak <mark>Chicken <mark><mark>Chicken Steak and Shrimp Combo Fajita Platter <mark>Chicken Feinstein <mark>Siegel <mark>Yemenidjian Taco Plate <mark>Steak <mark>Chicken <mark>Shrimp <mark>Veggie Bowl <mark>Chipotle Chicken <mark>Carne Asada <mark>Pork Carnitas <mark>Cochinita Pibil <mark>Cilantro Garlic Shrimp <mark>Cedar Chipotle Salmon <mark>Pineapple Shrimp <mark>Tropical Mahi <mark>Mexican Corn <mark>Seasonal Veggies Gluten Free</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark>, had enough kick to it, and tons of flavor. \n\nthe ambience was amazing. a cool gothic spanish feel with a modern twist. \n\nservice was great as well. \n\nthe only negative is that it's next to a strip club. but for all the parents the strip club is not connected. also the rice lacks flavor and needs more like and salt added to it. \n\n\nwe will definitely be back!", 
            "what an incredible restaurant. \n\nmy family tends to seek out the best mexican restaurants wherever we are, and this is definitely it in las vegas. the location is definitely odd, but the inside is incredibly inviting.\n\nthe food is fantastic. from the different salsas to the <mark>Deep Fried Ice Cream</mark>, el dorado cantina has not disappointed me. i love the <mark>Carne Asada Burrito</mark>; i crave it. the steak is definitely the best out of chicken, shrimp, and steak, but they are all good. the chef regularly comes into the dining room to greet the guests, and he is incredibly friendly. it really makes dining here a special experience. \n\nthis is my idea of a hidden gem in vegas, and i certainly hope more people are able to discover it.", 
            "amazing food!! all organic veggies and wild caught fish!! would come back everyday if i lived closer!!!! will come back for sure on my next visit to vegas!!! we had the table made guacamole...you can't get any fresher than that! i had the shrimp bowl...which was like a <mark>Shrimp Burrito</mark> without the shell!! the cilantro rice was cooked perfect and the shrimp where awesome...all the flavors of the dish where well balanced and i would totally get it again! my mom had the cider glazed salmon and her plate cleaned...she loved it!!! and for dessert we had the flan which was so smooth and flavorful the best flan i have ever had!! and we also ordered the <mark>Deep Fried Ice Cream</mark> which was heaven!! the staff is great, very friendly, and attentive.  the gm and the chef both came out so see how we liked our meal! they could tell by our clean plates that they did a job well done!! thank you so much for such a great experience!!", 
            "so finally got around to trying el dorado cantina. i know the place has gotten lot of hype mostly five star kind since day one. in my humble opinion feel like the food was good but nothing trendsetting or off the charts. the food would be 3stars. the service, entire staff, and chef paco not doubt five star experience. everyone on the staff super friendly from the moment you walk in from the hostess, the wait staff, and chef paco that guy no doubt love the man passion not only for his food! see chef paco walking around the dining room introducing himself, asking for feedback, checking make sure everything is great, and fun friendly guy easy make conversations. i know one of his regular customers. so next thing know started short conversation talking stories about our mutual friends. he telling me about his family flan that passed on from generation to generation that on the menu our waiter was great came for dinner with friend that also had el dorado bookmarked. we had few questions being first timers and even asked is could get one of each empanada. he came back said it was ok. so between the two of us got in few things for first timers.....\n\nwe started with the empanada like mention the menu choice of three different ones but asked if could get one of each. the cheese, chicken, or beef. i felt like the cheese was the best one out of the three. the portion size was pretty size although was appetizer. my first thought was looks like mini pizza pockets. the presentation liked with the sour cream drizzle on the bottom and nice little shredded red cabbage salad with salsa on the side. nothing really that was wow. the wings was ok. just your ordinary basic fried wings with side of ranch and celery sticks. we ordered on the spicy side since my friend likes spicy food. it had not much of kick at all. our entree we went with street tacos. we ordered one of each (six different ones on the menu) split each one. they were all solid street tacos. we finish was complimentary flan with your yelp check in. the family flam that chef paco passed on to him. i love the flan! it not as custard but more dense then regular one. so not as much jiggly going on. still had n<mark>Deep Fried Ice Cream</mark>, rich, and filling with every bite. the caramel crust on top was on point. \n\nthe only thing that found odd. every item that came out was not hot hot. not in spice level but temperature. my idea of street taco you heat the tortilla! whatever your protein choose throw that on flat top or what not then put both together. maybe since the restaurant literally next to strip club and way back the building was lvac. not sure where the kitchen is or how the place is set up. it was consistent through out our whole meal. the wings thinking deep fry then out but again not even warm warm. empanada same the filling was not smoking hot take that first bite or cut each on in half since we shared everything. it would have made the dining experience better one.\n\nthe table side guacamole or salsa. it looks cool but we never had enough room try that one next visit. they run special all the times on different days of the week. sunday that one of the better days our waiter was telling us. the happy hour prices especially the food times are steal of deal. like not been mention before might not be in the best of areas, or could get lost thinking going to sapphire or el dorado cantina. literally both front doors next to one another. if not been el dorado cantina place worth checking out. the bar area nice size. lots of televisions to watch sports, decor has different vibe, and hell if feel adventurous always go next door keep the good times rolling or taking it whole another level. lol!!!!!", 
            "such an amazing meal. super fresh ingredients, all made to perfection. my sons ordered off the kids meal and ate everything.! the children's menu items come with aqua fresca and churros. don't miss the fresh guacamole- made at your table. the chicken enchiladas were big enough to share. our waiter, rorke, was awesome and recommended we not miss dessert- so true! my husband had the <mark>Deep Fried Ice Cream</mark>, i had the flan, and the kids had the churros. every dessert was perfect! chef paco came to our table and was as sweet as could be. we will return here as soon as we can and tell friends to not miss this stop!", 
            "executive summary\n***the best mexican food in las vegas*****\n\nwe live in southern california where spanish is the official second language (if not first), and we have yet to find a restaurant this delicious!  of all places, we find our favorite mexican restaurant in las vegas.  imagine that.\n\nwe were initially attracted by the numerous reviews written, and after eating there once we understood why.\n\nchef paco brings generations of passion for oaxacan cuisine to this fine establishment.  he is not only talented, sources none gmo ingredients, but also one of the friendliest and humble chefs i've met.  he is genuinely interested in how he can better your dining experience.  for that, i would give him more stars if yelp allowed.  \n\ndrinks: we enjoyed the \"fresco\" of the day.  jamaica is my favorite.  their alcoholic menu was tempting though...\n\nappetizer: queso fundito (three cheeses baked in a skillet) is enough for 4 people to share.  the guacamole made table side is also good.  the table next to us, all men, really enjoyed the view when the waitress was smashing the fresh avocados. ;). again, good size to share.  \n\nentree 1: mole--three sauces simmered for 6+ hours.  it's flavored with spice so if you can't handle it, order something else. \n\nentree 2: <mark>Chile Relleno</mark>--vegetarian's dream come true.  the cilantro rice also has good flavor and is very buttery.\n\nif you are not too hungry they also have street tacos and tortas (aka: mexican hamburgers).\n\ndessert: flan (grandma's recipe) was creamy and the best i had!  i also saw other delectable choices such as <mark>Deep Fried Ice Cream</mark> and churros.  next time....\n\nthis is now on our \"must visit\" list when in vegas.  we will definitely be back!  thank you chef paco for bringing world class mexico cuisine to las vegas, just open a few more in southern california now will you please?\n\ntip: it's right next to sapphire strip club (practically sharing the same wall) so park in the same parking lot and you will see the restaurant!  makes for a convenient excuse for those men who's wives are gps tracking them...\n\n\"what? honey? oh no you are mistaken, i'm eating awesome mexican food, not at the strip club.\"  \n\nas the church lady would say, \"how convenient.\"  ;)\n\ntip#2: open 24 hrs!", 
            "omg...amazing food! wonderful margarita. ..so good! i'll definitely be back! sean rocks!...ok..just got dessert...the flan is the best i've ever had...i usually don't like flan but yowza! bring on the derp <mark>Deep Fried Ice Cream</mark>! compliments to chef paco!", 
            "one might think that a taco place attached to a strip club might not be the highest of quality but in this case? you'd be wrong.  it's pretty damn great.\n\nthe first time we went, we shared a pitcher of margaritas that are full of fresh flavor & there is no skimping of the tequila - they are amazing.  the chips & 3 salsas that are brought to the table are super yummy.  we also ordered the queso fundido with mushrooms which was tasty.  then there was the street tacos.  i ordered the carnitas tacos which were delicious.  the rice that came along with them was good (typical mexican side of rice).  we ordered a dessert to share - the <mark>Deep Fried Ice Cream</mark>.  it was really good.  i've had better versions but it was tasty.  especially the banana sauce on the side.  the service we had this night was great.\n\nas for the 2nd time we went, we happened to show up during happy hour.  surprisingly enough, it was not as busy as the 1st night we went but the service was so much slower & worse.  it took forever to get drinks, to order, to get refills, our food, etc.  that was the only reason for the 4 star review instead of a full 5.  i'm hoping the next time we go, the service will be as good as the food is!", 
            "quite literally some of the best mexican i have had!!! oy!! the table side guacamole, the street tacos, the fajitas, and the <mark>Deep Fried Ice Cream</mark> were absolutely to diiiiieeeee for! don't let the fact that it is next to a gentlemen's club prevent you from going. it is a must try and repeat! absolutely can't wait to go back. highly recommended!!!", 
            "my boyfriend found this restaurant on yelp because of its good reviews and boy oh boy it sure does live up to them! when we walked in we immediately got seated then shortly got our chips and three assortments of salsas.\nour entrees consisted of street tacos, salmon, and i had the veggie tacos. they were the best veggie tacos i had in my entire life! super flavorful and filling.\ni checked in here so i got a free flan :) i'm personally not a fan of flan so i gave it to my boyfriend. i got the <mark>Deep Fried Ice Cream</mark>. delish!!\n\ni will be back again whenever my mexican food cravings kick in!", 
            "slowest service ever! my bf and i gave this place another shot after our first experience was not very impressive (assuming they were having an off night). you can tell that they are extremely understaffed, it took the waiter about 15 minutes to come greet us and then another 15 minutes for me to get the margarita i had ordered. also, the drink must have spilled a bit on the way to my table because there was more salt running down the sides of my glass then there was on the rim.\n\nas for the food... the salsas that went with the chips were pretty tasty, we devoured them waiting for our food and asked for more chips that never arrived. i ordered the chicken fajitas, and they weren't bad but it was nothing to rave about. my bf ordered the street tacos that our waiter had recommended and he also wasn't impressed. for dessert we got the free flan after we checked in and we also ordered <mark>Deep Fried Ice Cream</mark> on top of that. once again another 15-20 minute wait! by that point we just wanted to leave but we couldn't because our server was no where to be found even 10 minutes after we had finished eating dessert...\n\n\nas i said, the food wasn't terrible, but the service was and that most likely put a damper on the whole experience for us. we most likely won't be back :(", 
            "followed prior reviews and had the street tacos and was not disappointed as the el pastor was excellent. neil was an excellent waiter! had the flan and it is as good as advertised! the <mark>Deep Fried Ice Cream</mark> was also good. chef paco makes a very nice presentation on your plate. he let us try his new creation of a cheesecake chimichanga with mexican chocolate. believe it will be a hit too! hear they will have a mariachi band on tuesdays and wine down wednesdays  that are 30% all wine and 1/2 off appetizers with live music. give them a try!", 
            "let's get real.  this is the best mexican food you can get with flavors that most resemble true mexico cuisine. the tacos are out of this world and the rice bowls are teeming with flavors i have never experienced.  if your looking for typical american-ized mexican food this is not the place for you.  while your here make sure you leave from for dessert. flan or <mark>Deep Fried Ice Cream</mark> are a must.",

            "ashley the bartender is amazing.  the cocktails were the best i have had ever. the food is the best mexican in town. we had all the desserts and each one was better. the <mark>Deep Fried Ice Cream</mark>, churros & flan was by far the best. we will be back.",

            "this place is real mexican food with a 2014 healthy twist.  they just opened their doors on july 19 and open 24 hours...yum! \n\nlocation: yelp reviewers were right about sharing the parking lot with a strip club but i hope folks don't let that stop them from coming here with their kids and families.  i went with my husband and 16-year-old son.  there's also plenty of parking.\n\nambience:  tastefully decorated.  large booths and tables. \nalso has a large bar and the drinks are perfectly made to compliment the food. i ordered a margarita. \n\nservice: alessandro was our waiter.  he is very attentive, friendly but professional.  he made us feel like we were family.  i loved that the other waiters would check on us, too.  i hate going to a place and the only person servicing your table is your waiter.  it felt like everyone is looking out for each other and most of all the customers. \n\nfood: let's start with the chips and 3 amazing fresh made salas - mild, medium and hot!  i loved them all but the hot just exploded with flavor.  we were told about the fresh made juices and i was torn between ordering the margarita or the juice.  to my surprise, one of the waiters came out with a small sample of the pineapple juice and it was superb.  what a treat.  my husband and i shared steak and chicken fajitas which were perfectly seasoned and tender.  the portion was great for sharing.  my son had the breakfast chorizo burrito which comes with fresh potato slices.   he said it exceeded his expectations and wasn't planning on sharing any of it.  he devoured it all.  \n\ndessert: my son got the <mark>Tres Leches Cake</mark>. it was moist but not soggy.  chef paco treated my husband and i to a sample of the flan.  it has sweet and had 4 distinct flavors.  we typical don't order dessert and i recommend that you not pass up dessert because you have got to try either of these.\n\nchef paco: he is down to earth and his food is inspired by the recipes that his mother and grandmother taught him. \n\nwe were lucky to find this gem and look forward to returning soon and exploring more items on the menu.", 
            "el dorado cantina is one of my favorite new restaurants in town.  this definitely rivals javier's at aria for the \"high end\" vegas mexican cuisine market, but the prices are way more reasonable.  chef paco and his staff are churning out some really good stuff.  \n\nwant a great way to spice up a weekday dinner?  how about doing as the aztecs did back in the day (century) and start off with some grasshoppers?  yes, sir!  edc's \"chapulines\" can be prepared saut\\u00e9ed either in garlic lime or habanero.  for the uninitiated, the closest thing to compare them to would be crispy shrimp tails but juicier.  the habanero order offered terrific heat and not in a painful, shoot me in the face kind of way.  at $7.50, it was a large portion that could have easily satisfied a party of six.  not for everyone by any means, my wife was literally one and done, but i enjoyed it and had plenty to take home (fried rice, anyone?).\n\n\"<mark>Imperial Shrimp</mark>\" was everything i look for in an appetizer: seafood stuffed pacific wild shrimp wrapped in bacon and then lightly fried. the creamy heat (sounds gross, right?) from the chipotle ranch dressing that accompanied the dish was awesome.  more things in life should be wrapped in bacon!  i should start a national campaign.\n\nwe chose to split the humungous carne asada entr\\u00e9e.  the citrus marinated steak was medium rare perfection.  i loved the big slabs of grilled cactus that it came with.  we probably boxed up 70 percent of the plate.  goddamn nachos and salsa....\n\nyou'd think that would prevent us from ordering dessert, but the flan and <mark>Tres Leches Cake</mark> somehow made it to the table.  the latter was plated nicely and the rum flavor made me feel like i was on vacation.  it was a great end to the meal and i can't wait to try more.", 
            "c'mon...this is why i use yelp! i never would've found this place without yelp. it's a tough location off strip, basic adjoining the sapphire gentleman's club. it wouldn't have been a first choice except for the positive reviews and photos on yelp. i had my phone telling me i arrived at my destination, yet there was no signage other than the club. i was about to leave until i saw the small awning and sign above the door. thank god i found it, so, enough about the location, let's get to eating!\n\nfirst off, it was sunday lunch time during football and our server kelsey tells us that all street tacos were a buck a piece. a buck a piece! best deal in vegas hands down! i had 3 conchinita pibil and 3 carne asada. (i was starving) and my wife had the conchinita pibil with rice and beans. kesley advised that instead of getting the combo from the menu, to have her order it with the special so it would be cheaper. um, okay...thanks!\n\nwe immediately get our drinks and chips with three salsas, verde, roasted red, and habanero. this is generally our first test with a mexcian restaurant and they passed with flying colors. spicy and deep in flavor. just the way we like it. \n\nwe they had kelsey bring out our table side guacamole. now, we've had this a several restaurants before, but this may have been my favorite. she started by taking whole cloves of garlic and grinding them into the bowl. she asked what we wanted to add and if we wanted i spicy. of course, add it all! cilantro, onion, tomato, and serrano peppers. perfectly seasoned, creamy, spicy...awesome guac! just as we're digging in to the guac, out comes our lunch, delivered personally by chef paco. he's a warm, charming, and obviously a passionate chef. there is a lot of love in his food and you can tell he appreciates his customers.\n\nthe food is outstanding. the carne asada had a nice char and was obviously marinated in some citrous concoction. delicious! the conchinita has been slow roasted with achiote paste and has pickled onion and habaneros as a garnish. pork heaven! i think this may have been my favorite taco of all time. the rice and beans are good as well, but i'm too busy stuffing myself with tacos.somehow i actually kill the whole plate.\n\nkelsey has been a very attentive server throughout our meal, refilling our drinks without waiting for us to ask, and being very friendly during our stay. she comes at the end of the meal and asks if we left room for dessert. of course we didn't, but i'm not going to miss out if it's only half as good as dinner, it's going to be amazing. we ordered flan, which would be my first choice as i'm not usually a big fan. kelsey returns with the flan along with chef paco. this time he's carrying a <mark>Tres Leches Cake</mark>. he tells us, i heard you couldn't decide on dessert so i'm bring you this one on the house. are you kidding me? \n\nof course this seals the deal making it the best lunch i can remember having in las vegas. the food...amazing....but when you get service that matches and even exceeds the food, you've got something special. do not hesitate to get to this spot if you're in vegas! chef paco and kelsey, we'll be back on our next trip for sure!", 
            "i can confirm the rumors.  as a long-standing fan of mundo haute cuisine in the las vegas design center for the high end and taco y taco for the low end but high quality, i have to admit that foodies should gather up outside a strip club to get las vegas's most reliable top quality mexican.  wow, there.  i said it.  24 hour opening is great.  \n\nonly one star deduction for one reason.  service can be a bit spotty here.\n\ni have been there when 5 different people asked me how things are going in 5 minutes - interrupting conversation and chewing each time (annoyed).  i have also waited to get my order taken way too long on other occasions.  they need to get the staffing right.  \n\nonce they do, this place is a rocket ship.  also - note to management (and i hate to say this as a consumer): we want you to stay in business for a long long time.  charge $1-2 more for every entree.  with reviews as top quality as this on yelp and everywhere, we are more concerned about your financial stability in the future than your pricing.  \n\nfavorites: queso flameado, tableside guacamole, carne asada, <mark>Tres Leches Cake</mark>,", 
            "came here for my 21st birthday dinner with my boyfriend. the both of us have been craving mexican food so after doing some good research on yelp, el dorado seemed like a great restaurant - which it was!! you walk in and the restaurant is beautiful. i love the walls and decorations, really sets the mood and ambiance. the service was great as well! once we were seated we were given waters and bottomless chips and salsa (three kinds of salsa!) plus the chips were so fresh!! because we both checked in on yelp we also used the buy on get one free margarita deal! our server helped recommend great dishes. it was happy hour and so we got our appetizer half off. we chose the shrimp taquitos. then for the main entrees we had the carne asada taco plate and the beef enchiladas plate, which both came with rice and beans. then, for dessert we got the <mark>Tres Leches Cake</mark>. oh my goodness we were filled!! everything tastes so fresh and yummy.\n\nthe only reason for the 4/5 stars is because it was so difficult for us to find! we kept going back and forth on industrial continuously passing sapphire gentlemen's club until we finally decided to pull up the the club's main entrance and found el dorado cantina literally attached to the strip club lol. we were a little surprised and thought it might end up being a tacky restaurant, but it definitely wasn't! loved it!!",

none of this an issue when taking a look at plate two, each overstuffed burrito amongst the best i've tasted in recent memory while taquitos were light and greaseless, the chicken quesadilla also quite special with onions adding a smoky, aromatic punch.\n\nadmittedly full, to the point where a solid meal or two's worth of food was boxed up to go, it was still without hesitation that dessert was ordered and although the boozy tres leches was quite excellent beneath whipped cream <mark>Steak <mark>Chicken <mark><mark>Chicken Steak and Shrimp Combo Fajita Platter <mark>Chicken Feinstein <mark>Siegel <mark>Yemenidjian Taco Plate <mark>Steak <mark>Chicken <mark>Shrimp <mark>Veggie Bowl <mark>Chipotle Chicken <mark>Carne Asada <mark>Pork Carnitas <mark>Cochinita Pibil <mark>Cilantro Garlic Shrimp <mark>Cedar Chipotle Salmon <mark>Pineapple Shrimp <mark>Tropical Mahi <mark>Mexican Corn <mark>Seasonal Veggies Gluten Free</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark> fruit it was chef paco's ancient flan recipe that stole my heart, the texture far more thick than many would associate with the dish, but each caramel tinged bite proving as good as the last until each plate was clean, the chef himself standing tableside and offering gifts from a care packaged straight from mexico while discussing his passion for cooking as the meal reached an end.\n\norganic + non-gmo + 24/7 + authentic mexican food + next to a strip club = an equation only las vegas could dream up, and like many things in this fabulous city it works like a charm.", 
            "i'm just as thrilled as the next person to find a mexican restaurant that uses organic, non-gmo, sustainable products. i also really dig the nice interior and massive tequila selection. their house red sangria is tasty, and the margs are strong.\n\nbut i was unexpectedly underwhelmed by the actual food. so much so that i don't clearly remember what i ate. i recall a great tableside guac. the taquitos were fine, nothing to write home about. the burrito i tried (pulled chicken, maybe?) was bland and dry. the <mark>Tres Leches Cake</mark> was awesome, and i'm not usually a fan in the first place. i know i tried several other items, but i can't remember them.\n\npricing is a bit high for mexican food and for the location, but obviously the organic, non-gmo, etc ingredients cost a premium. given all the amazing five-star reviews, i have to wonder if i came on an off night or just ordered the wrong items? will likely end up returning to try the <mark>Chile Relleno</mark> and a seafood or salad dish.", 
            "vhalery was a fantastic server! she was attentive and made us feel right at home. she gave a us a menu tour since the menu was quite overwhelming at first. we decided on the elote and carne asada tacos. it was quite tasty! she suggested that we get our elote shaved which made it so much easier to eat and less messy. from there we tried the <mark>Tres Leches Cake</mark>, the flan and the churros. the <mark>Tres Leches Cake</mark> had a strong rum taste which was interesting. other than that, everything was on point! i definitely recommend this spot!", 
            "so we went on a monday when they had the 50% off locals deal.  note it is 25% off now for locals.   due to location and distance the discount definitely was enticing.  we started off with a pitcher of margaritas.  it was a good size pitcher and they were decently strong .  the good thing was the non drinking wife is my built in designated driver.   \n   for appetizers we had the empanadas, shrimp cocktail and shrimp taquitos.  they were all very good.  the empanadas were as good as my former neighbor made for me every christmas.  they use good shrimp which are fresh tasting and don't have the weird aftertaste you get from frozen shrimp sometimes.  that made they cocktail and taquitos really good.  we got a bowl of the albondigas which was ok but not the best i have ever had.  \n  we had shrimp tacos, cilantro garlic shrimp and carne asada plate for dinner - note there was 3 of us.  i am not that big of an eater.  the shrimp tacos and garlic shrimp was very good and really hit the spot.  the carne asada reminded me of a place in rosarita i just loved.  the meat was well seasoned and so tender.  \n   we finished off this mini foodie fest with the <mark>Tres Leches Cake</mark> and leche flan.  they were both amazing desserts.   a perfect ending to a very good meal.  our server was amber and she was incredible.  despite the place being packed and amber having several tables she made sure we were well taken care of.  \n   they can get busy on monday's so i made reservations of which i highly recommend.  they were turning people away the night we were there.  it is an odd location as they are not too far from the strip and also next to a strip club they share a parking lot with.  with the discount they were very reasonable.  without the discount too expensive as they are no better than the nice mexican places not near the strip.", 
            "my favorite place !!! it is so weird because on the side there is a strip club hahaha but i got to admit that the main reason i come and eat here is because the food my favorite is the carne asada plate and a guacamole made at your table i also love the flan and the 3 <mark>Tres Leches Cake</mark> yummi yummi this place i can eat everyday and never get tired it is worth every penny !!!!"

            "my first visit was on a thursday night at 10 pm. me and the wifey came in and got seated right away. as we looked over the menu were happily munching on the bottomless chips and salsa they gave us which were complimentary. i kid you not, by the time our server came to take our order we were already working on our second basket of chips! damn you good tasting chips and salsa! also, damn you servers who are constantly walking by refilling the chips and salsa! we both agreed to share a meal since we definitely overdid it on the chips.\n\nwhat we ordered was the the steak n chicken mixed fajita platter ($25). it has sliced green, red, and yellow bell peppers along with sliced onions. the shrimp were some pretty sized good chunks. the cut up pieces of steak were tender and very juicy. if you just sat down and get a whiff of this dish as the server walks by you, that alone will pretty much entice you to order it. comes with a plate of sour cream, guacamole, pico de gallo, and your choice of black or refried beans. you also get either flour or corn tortillas. im glad we shared it for we barely finished it! we finished up with a free flan as the special for checking in on yelp. for you peeps with a sweet tooth, this dessert is rich.\n\nour second visit we decided to go on a monday to take advantage of the locals 50 percent off on the entire menu. we were strongly recommended to make a reservation for you just might wait awhile before a table opens up.\n\nas we showed up for our 7 pm reservation, the place was packed! people were waiting to be seated but not us. we proceeded to our table right away. we wanted to try different things so being the carnivore that i am, i went with the carne asada plate ($26) and wifey went with the conchinita pibill ($24). i was also curious about the mexican corn ($5) so we got that as well. for dessert, we got the flan ($8).\n\nthis time we kind of went easy on the chips and salsa so we can make a dent in our individual meals. again, we were wrong. we could of shared just one meal and still be fully satisfied. oh well, my oldest son could not have been happier when we brought home the leftovers!\n\nthe carne asada they give you 2, that's right, two nicely sized marinated skirt steaks. comes with a scoop of some type of steamed buttered rice (no, its not like rice pilaf) guacomole, and your choice of refried or black beans. but wait, there's more. you also get a grilled jalapeno and another grilled type of red pepper. they even give you some kind of pork sausage as well. the steak i requested medium rare and it was spot on! it was perfectly seasoned with whatever marinade they use. i can even taste a hint of lime in it. it is some of the best asada i have had in a long time.\n\nthe conchinita pibill was highly recommended by our server amber. she said it was one of favorite pork dishes. it is basically carnitas but with some different spices. it was so tender and juicy that i was alternating from my plate to hers.\n\nthe mexican corn (elote), is a roasted corn on the cobb coated with mayonaise, <mark>Queso Fundido <mark>Tostaditas de Tinga <mark>Mexican Shrimp Cocktail <mark>Pozole <mark>Albondigas Soup <mark>Mexican Chili <mark>Carnitas <mark>Al Pastor <mark>Carne Asada <mark>Pulled Chicken <mark>Cochinita Taco <mark>Corn Rajas Tacos <mark>Grilled Mahi <mark>Veggie <mark>Shrimp Taco <mark>Lettuce Wraps <mark>Cheese <mark>Chicken <mark>Beef <mark>Seafood Enchiladas <mark>SunFed Ranch Organic Grilled Steak <mark>Mary s Free Range Organic Chicken <mark>Grilled Wild Pacific Shrimp <mark>Steak <mark>Chicken <mark><mark>Chicken Steak and Shrimp Combo Fajita Platter <mark>Chicken Feinstein <mark>Siegel <mark>Yemenidjian Taco Plate <mark>Steak <mark>Chicken <mark>Shrimp <mark>Veggie Bowl <mark>Chipotle Chicken <mark>Carne Asada <mark>Pork Carnitas <mark>Cochinita Pibil <mark>Cilantro Garlic Shrimp <mark>Cedar Chipotle Salmon <mark>Pineapple Shrimp <mark>Tropical Mahi <mark>Mexican Corn <mark>Seasonal Veggies Gluten Free</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark>, and sprinkle of cayenne powder. comes with a couple of slices of lime for you to squeeze on to it.\n\nto complete our meal we got the flan again since we know that it is very good. now remember this second visit we only paid 35 dollars instead of 70 and we still had plenty of leftovers\n\nservice. as luck would have it, we ended up getting the same server as last time which was amber. now she is very efficient. not only does she serve other tables, but she is always looking at our table to see if we needed anything that was commonly asked. she did this every time she walked by carrying other customers' orders. all her other co-servers did their part by picking up empty plates as they walked by. not once did i ask for a refill on our waters and <mark>Soda</mark> at all both visits. now that is great service.\n\nsome random useful info. besides what i mentioned above, they are 24 hours, they have numerous gmo free and organic menu options not to mention <mark>Empanadas <mark>Sopes <mark>Beef <mark>Chicken <mark>Shrimp Taquitos <mark>Aguachiles <mark>El Dorado Nachos <mark>Queso Fundido <mark>Tostaditas de Tinga <mark>Mexican Shrimp Cocktail <mark>Pozole <mark>Albondigas Soup <mark>Mexican Chili <mark>Carnitas <mark>Al Pastor <mark>Carne Asada <mark>Pulled Chicken <mark>Cochinita Taco <mark>Corn Rajas Tacos <mark>Grilled Mahi <mark>Veggie <mark>Shrimp Taco <mark>Lettuce Wraps <mark>Cheese <mark>Chicken <mark>Beef <mark>Seafood Enchiladas <mark>SunFed Ranch Organic Grilled Steak <mark>Mary s Free Range Organic Chicken <mark>Grilled Wild Pacific Shrimp <mark>Steak <mark>Chicken <mark><mark>Chicken Steak and Shrimp Combo Fajita Platter <mark>Chicken Feinstein <mark>Siegel <mark>Yemenidjian Taco Plate <mark>Steak <mark>Chicken <mark>Shrimp <mark>Veggie Bowl <mark>Chipotle Chicken <mark>Carne Asada <mark>Pork Carnitas <mark>Cochinita Pibil <mark>Cilantro Garlic Shrimp <mark>Cedar Chipotle Salmon <mark>Pineapple Shrimp <mark>Tropical Mahi <mark>Mexican Corn <mark>Seasonal Veggies Gluten Free</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark> and organic items as well. oh, did i mention that they are right next to sapphire, one of largest strip clubs in vegas? guys (and gals) how many times have you gone to a strip club but had to leave later on because you were starving? yeah, i know makin it rain on them strippers makes me hungry too. just do the hokey pokey and turn yourself around. just like that you are feasting on great mexican food no matter what time of day it is. they even have giant flat screen tv's strewn all around the restaurant so you dont miss the \"big\" game if it so applies. sometimes, the master chef paco will be walking around making sure everything is ok. dude is very friendly.\n\nin closing, even though they opened just last year, i am still mad at myself for not checking them out sooner. i cant wait for my next meal here and i will definitely let other foodies know!

            "this place isn't even deserving of one star. we came to eat at noon on a sunday. we were a party of 4, the restaurant was empty and the service sucked!! it took the waitress 20 plus minutes just to bring us our drinks (2 <mark>Soda</mark> and 2 bloody mary's) the bloody mary tasted like pure tomato juice  when our food finally did come the food was overly salty and half our order was wrong. i asked for a side of sour cream and was charged $2! wtf?! this place is way over priced and too americanized. not authentic at all. it was a total waste of our time and money!"

            "this isnt just a restaurant or a meal. its an experience! a great one at that. this place was an utter delight the second we walked in.the decor rivals anything any of the casinos can offer. we were seating promptly, with a smile, to a huge round booth.we felt truly welcomed immediately.\n\nthen our waitress came out beaming with positive energy and took our drink order. i ordered an <mark>Iced Tea</mark>, which was great, and in a big glass. wifey wanted water, as we had already had our fill of alcohol our short vegas jaunt.\n\nshe returned with chips that were purple, and served with 3 different types of salsa. we were warned about the spiciness of the orange habanero salsa, but it wasnt so bad. we enjoyed it. the salsa verde was good. but we devoured the delicious red salsa casera, which was quickly noticed and refilled. awesome.\n\nwe shared a chicken gordita plate as an appetizer. they came out smaller than we expected. no worries though, we enjoyed them. very good.\n\nwifey ordered the carne asada nachos. they came out with great presentation, and plenty of meat. all the fixins. they took nachos to another level. portion was big enough to share.\n\ni had a carna <mark>Carne Asada Burrito</mark>. i would place this burrito in the top 10 all-time <mark>Carne Asada Burrito</mark> ever. i found myself eating slowly to savor the goodness. fantastic.\n\nchef paco came out to greet us, and thank us for our patronage. we showered him with compliments and thanked him for making us such delectable food. what a nice, geniune hombre.\n\nwe recieved complimentary flan for checking in on my phone. my wife has hated flan since childhood, and reluctantly tried some. she loved it! because this is the worlds greatest flan! no joke, this is the best flan either of us have ever had bar none. if you try it, try to incorporate some of the mint leaf into your bite, it adds a little extra to the indulgence.\n\nthis restaurant has earned our loyalty, and we will be coming here every time we are in town. we rather enjoyed the adventure in finding this place, and dont mind the strip club next door. if you dont like strippers, you shouldnt be in las vegas.\n\nwell done guys"

            "this place is stellar mexican food.  so far i have yet to find a great mexican spot, but this might be it.  i have had several dishes off of the menu which were all tasty.  \n\n     however the garlic shrimp was bomb, i love the beans here also.  i had the fried chicken i forgot the name, it was good however if it came with sauce it would be better so i added there chipotle cream which made it right.  taquitos and <mark>Imperial Shrimp</mark> apps are delicious.  you have to order the lemonade <mark>Daily Agua Fresca</mark>, so bomb i had about 5 glasses.  i'm not a big sangria drinker but even that was tasty. desert the churros are so good, they come with a little cream filling and a banana foster sauce to dip them in.  flan has a cheesecake like consistency which i like, because i don't care for traditional flan and the eggy taste.  i will definitely go back. so many good dishes and chef paco can custom make dishes to your taste. \n\n     some dishes are $25 and i think they could be a little cheaper however on average dishes are $10-$17. its good for groups and even coming in by yourself has a nice open layout and friendly staff.  if you come to vegas for mexican food near the strip or just good flavors, try it.", 
            "after a few attempts at grabbing late night grub at local yet over-crowded taco bars, we decided to try el dorado cantina. we initially passed by the location a few times due to a combination of the dark street, discreet signage and the unexpected location surroundings - but were pleased to receive some of the best service i have ever experienced, a great food selection in a very cool and relaxed environment.\n\ndon't let the location deter you from trying this restaurant.\n\nwe were promptly greeted at the front door by the hostess who seated us at a back table. while the restaurant was a bit dark, it seemed chill/cool/clean.\n\nour most outstanding waiter, andy, visited the table, discussed the menu with us and provided recommendations. he was able to name-drop the farms where el dorado sources their meat and brought out watermelon <mark>Daily Agua Fresca</mark> for us to try, be still my beating heart. i love <mark>Daily Agua Fresca</mark> and their offering did not disappoint.\n\nwe opted for the:\n\ntableside guacamole - <mark>Empanadas <mark>Sopes <mark>Beef <mark>Chicken <mark>Shrimp Taquitos <mark>Aguachiles <mark>El Dorado Nachos <mark>Queso Fundido <mark>Tostaditas de Tinga <mark>Mexican Shrimp Cocktail <mark>Pozole <mark>Albondigas Soup <mark>Mexican Chili <mark>Carnitas <mark>Al Pastor <mark>Carne Asada <mark>Pulled Chicken <mark>Cochinita Taco <mark>Corn Rajas Tacos <mark>Grilled Mahi <mark>Veggie <mark>Shrimp Taco <mark>Lettuce Wraps <mark>Cheese <mark>Chicken <mark>Beef <mark>Seafood Enchiladas <mark>SunFed Ranch Organic Grilled Steak <mark>Mary s Free Range Organic Chicken <mark>Grilled Wild Pacific Shrimp <mark>Steak <mark>Chicken <mark><mark>Chicken Steak and Shrimp Combo Fajita Platter <mark>Chicken Feinstein <mark>Siegel <mark>Yemenidjian Taco Plate <mark>Steak <mark>Chicken <mark>Shrimp <mark>Veggie Bowl <mark>Chipotle Chicken <mark>Carne Asada <mark>Pork Carnitas <mark>Cochinita Pibil <mark>Cilantro Garlic Shrimp <mark>Cedar Chipotle Salmon <mark>Pineapple Shrimp <mark>Tropical Mahi <mark>Mexican Corn <mark>Seasonal Veggies Gluten Free</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark> & vegan\nchipotle chicken\ncochinita pibil\nwatermelon <mark>Daily Agua Fresca</mark>\n\nthe guacamole was on point and we ate so much, so quickly, that by time the food came out we didn't have much room left. as native texans, we both should have known better than to eat 8,000 pounds of corn chips before a meal but who can say no to avocado. andy made it so perfectly spicy, i wanted to cry (tears of happiness).\n\ni found the chipotle chicken to be on the dry side, but the sauce balanced it out a bit. it should be noted that i took most of it home and promptly stuffed my face with it the next morning. it was my main source of fuel for the rock n roll marathon later that evening.\n\nthe service was outstanding, the food was solid, and the environment was both relaxed and comfortable. definitely worth a visit.",
