            "i love maggiano's!! it is great for big parties. my family and i are a huge fan of the family style lunch. \n\nhttp://www.maggianos.com/foodbeverage/default.asp?menu=family%20style%20lunch\n\nyou get two choices of appetizers, salads, pastas, entrees and desserts. they also refill the plates. so if you finish your appetizer, they'll give you another one and if you don't finish it they let you box it up. \n\nmy favorites are the <mark>Calamari Fritt</mark>, <mark>Stuffed Mushrooms</mark> and the tiramisu!!!\n\neveryone in the world needs to celebrate one event in their life at maggiano's. it is totally worth the price.", 
            "went to maggiano's on sunday night for surprise engagement dinner. we were a group of 11 and only had to wait around 20 minutes. we were able to share a bottle of prosecco at the bar during the wait. we were told our table was ready and they led us into the wine cellar. i was so excited to be in a private room with dimmed lighting.\n\nfrom dinner we ordered the classic family style and were given the choices of two appetizers, salads, pastas, entrees and desserts. the food doesn't stop. the only hard part was agreeing on what to order. \n\nappetizers: <mark>Calamari Fritt</mark>\\u00e9 and bruschetta. \nsalads: ceasar and chopped.\npastas: <mark>Mom's Lasagna</mark> and chicken & truffle tortellacci \nentrees: chicken saltimbocca and <mark>Baked Eggplant Parmesan</mark>\ndesserts: creme brulee and chocolate zuccotto cake \n\nmy favorites were the <mark>Chopped Salad</mark>, love blue cheese! chicken & truffle tortellacci was the most interesting flavors and the <mark>Baked Eggplant Parmesan</mark> had the perfect breaded textured and eggplant was cooked just right. creme brulee was fantastic and huge, but by that point we were so full. i would also recommend the chianti castello di querceto. went really well with the <mark>Mom's Lasagna</mark>.\n\nryan was our server and he was fantastic. very attentive and helpful. they even brought in two older men who played guitar and violin and had us do our first dance. the night was great. thank you maggiano's and ryan!", 
            "breaking news: notorious italian cuisine hater, archie g., had italian food for dinner and didn't immediately want to vomit afterwards.\n\non a business trip in las vegas, my speaking manager (who does not speak spanish) asked me to help him take out our large limited our latin american distributors (who don't speak english) for dinner. somehow, i was put in charge of finding a restaurant suitable for all four of us. normally, i shy away from huge responsibility at work. i avoid the break room so i don't have to ever have to take out the trash. that's just how lazy i am.\n\nanyway, with this language challenged arrangement, i knew it was going to be up to me (and my two years of spanish in college) to keep the dinner engaging, organized, and running smoothly. luckily for me, maggiano's helped out with the experience.\n\nthe two chilean clients communicated to me that they loved steak and italian food. with the help of my yelp blackberry application, i suggested benihana or maggiano's (and tried not show sadness in my eyes). ironically, their eyes lit up when they heard maggiano's and the date was set.\n\nfor starters, the staff here is a superb. the hostess helped me make a reservation for a couple hours later, so i was able to give the rest of the dinner participants time to get ready, as i ran off and went shopping for a little gift for la novia at the nearby mall. our server was awesome. how lucky was i that the server was chilean? he helped out immensely making our chilean clients feel comfortable, recommending dishes and beers, and making on occasional joke or two. great guy. great server. give that guy a raise.\n\nas for the food, it wasn't terrible. we had the \"all you can eat family style\" meal, which included two salads, two appetizers, four main courses, and two desserts to share (and share and share) until we were ready to be wheeled out of the restaurant.\n\nappetizers: we had the \"<mark>Calamari Fritt</mark>\" and \"<mark>Stuffed Mushrooms</mark>.\" the fried calamari was average and the dipping sauce was essentially ragu. i liked the <mark>Stuffed Mushrooms</mark> and so did the rest of the group as had another round of it. however, i did wonder why they were not given an italian name on the menu. maybe the guy who wrote the menu only took 2 years of italian in college?\n\nsalads: the \"<mark>Chopped Salad</mark>\" was a eally good salad. there is no way it can be good for you.  we also had the \"<mark>Italian Tossed Salad</mark>\" and it was wonderful. who doesn't love a good <mark>Italian Tossed Salad</mark> by an italian?\n\nmain courses: we ordered 4 different main courses. the \"spaghetti, meatball\" and i could have made it better at home. the \"veal ravioli\" was pretty good. it wasn't as heavy as i had imagined. the \"gnocchi, tomato vodka sauce\" was my contribution to the group. the gnocchi just melted in your mouth. it was the best dish all night and we had another round of it. the \"the \"salmon, lemon & herb\" smelled pretty bad. i was afraid to get that on my lips or fingers. i didn't want la novia to pick me up from the airport and think i was having an affair or something.\n\ndesserts: the cr\\u00e8me brulee was pretty good. we had three rounds of this. i love burnt cream. we had the \"n.y. style cheesecake\" and it well, it was just plain ol' cheesecake. i think the \"n.y.\" stood for \"not your.\" as in, \"not your style cheesecake.\"\n\noverall, the food was up and down and mostly mediocre. it was factory style italian food that lacked much distinctive flavor. essentially, it was a pricier version of \"olive garbage\" or \"bucket of crappo.\"\n\nthis was no more than 2 to 2.5 star food. but the ambiance and staff helped make this a very successful business dinner. so successful, we went out on the town for an adventure that included gambling, karaoke, and general las vegas debauchery.\n\nand well, i will award another star for that.", 
            "this is probably the best italian chain restaurant that i've ever eaten at. not only did i enjoy the atmosphere and service, the food was phenomenal! \n\nto start off a very nice family vacation, we decided to eat at maggiano's and try their family-style dinner. the server - who is probably the best i've ever met - warned us that it will be a lot of food and very heavy. we took on the challenge and tried their \"classic dinner\": (2) appetizers, (2) salads, (4) main courses, and (2) desserts. \n\nappetizers: barb's spinach and artichoke dip & <mark>Calamari Fritt</mark>. they split the spinach and artichoke dip into two plates and had a giant plate of fried calamari. both were excellent dishes - the calamari was not overcooked and the dip was just gooey perfection.\n\nsalad: caesar and spinach. i'm not a big salad eater, but i heard it was excellent.\n\nmain course: chicken piccata, chicken saltimbocca, grilled salmon lemon & herb, and linguini & clams with red sauce. each dish was amazing! the piccata was not overcooked or drowning in sauce. the saltimbocca, which is fried chicken patties wrapped in prosciutto and cheese, was just delicious! the salmon was good. and the linguini was not drowning in sauce and just the right amount of clams.\n\ndessert: tiramisu and creme brulee. both were just perfect - the tiramisu was just so delicious - not too sweet and not too bland. the creme brulee had the perfect golden crust and was so smooth.\n\nyes, it is a lot of food for a table of five. but it gets better for those who think $30 a person is a bit too much. each plate - from the appetizer to the desert - is refillable! they won't stuff giving you until you tell them no more! so for the price, the service, and the food - maggiano's is definitely worth it!", 
            "we've always liked our normally pretty flawless dining experiences here.  but on this particular occasion, when of course i was introducing the restaurant to two friends, the wheels of service largely came off the tracks.  we had reserved a booth that overlooked picture windows facing strip hotels across the street, but it wasn't ready when we arrived.  we had to wait about 20 minutes for a booth to be cleared, which was no big deal.  but it established a pattern of service being at least two beats behind all night.\n\nfor starters, i ordered <mark>Calamari Fritt</mark> and crab & shrimp imperial, a special of the day.  i also ordered a cup of <mark>Tuscan Chicken Sausage</mark> & orzo soup and a side of <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> before my entree of linguine & clams.  bread arrived first, which was good and crusty.  but our iced teas and soft drinks were not brought forth until 10 minutes after the presentation of bread, evo, and butter.  and, one soft drink was missing.  so were two of four bread plates and a knife.  \n\nsoon afterward, the appetizers arrived.  unfortunately, so did both my soup and salad.  four items were plopped on the table at the same time--all of them mine.  although jammed up with food, i did my best to race through the appetizers before my soup got cold, and largely succeeded by taking half of each appetizer home.  the crab & shrimp imperial, consisting of crab-stuffed lobster with herb bread crumbs and lobster cream sauce over orzo pasta, was simply excellent.  it was also very filling.  the deep-fried calamari was uncharacteristically undercooked, but still fairly tasty--especially dipped in the lemon aioli that was prepared on request.  the accompanying marinara sauce was also good and mellow.  \n\nas before, the <mark>Tuscan Chicken Sausage</mark> & orzo soup did not disappoint.  the fennel-flavored soup packed an unusual but welcome taste of mild sausage, fresh tomatoes, celery, and white beans.  the side of <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> was a generous helping of cool and crisp romaine greens with focaccia croutons and grated parmesan cheese.  linguine & clams with invisible but tasty white clam sauce was a nice pasta dish that boasted both fresh and chopped clams.  but, unfortunately, only 7 fresh clams were present, which not only seemed meager but were far less than i had enjoyed on a previous occasion.  and, i bit down on a small piece of clam shell that was included in the mix.   \n\ngarlic bread focaccia was not very garlicky at all.  and, inexplicably, the cheesy fontina potatoes that my wife had ordered did not arrive at our table until 20 minutes beyond the third of three promises of \"2 minutes longer\" by our server, just after our packaged leftovers had been handed to us.  obviously, we didn't want additional starch any more at a point when we were about to leave the premises.  after an apology by our server that seemed sincere, the still steaming potatoes were packaged in a baking tin and presented to us again without charge.\n\nthe quality of ingredients and tastiness of what i ate were mostly sound as always.  and, kudos and an extra 1/2-star to restaurant management for calling to report that my missing kindle had been found on the floor of our booth, before i raced back to retrieve it right after midnight.  so, 3-1/2 stars on an off night.", 
            "the ambiance was my favorite part.  we made reservations around 6:30 pm on saturday.  the earliest seating was at 9:15 pm.  we arrived at the fashion show mall, parked, and wondered our way out front to the entrance of maggiano's.  i always love the atmosphere in these kind of places.  i'm not a big fan of italian food, so don't read too much into my comments about the food.  the <mark>Calamari Fritt</mark> was a bit greasy with too much oil, but was overall pretty good.  the marinara dipping sauce was superb.  we also had <mark>Stuffed Mushrooms</mark>, which were really good.  they were stuffed with spinach and topped with seasoned bread crumbs and served in a garlic white wine sauce.  my fiance and i shared a bowl of linguine di mare.  it had lobster, shrimp, clams, & mussels with noodles in a spicy lobster tomato broth.  it was pretty good.  lots of meat.  very filling.  a man with a guitar and another man with an accordion serenaded us with a romantic italian song.  simply romantic.  we had nice seats facing las vegas boulevard.  we lingered a while after paying the bill, but the server stopped refilling our water.  this bothered me a little.  i was unusually thirsty and could not seem to get enough.  the bill was almost $60.  we had to take an alternate route back to the car because the fashion show mall was closed.  i enjoyed this experience and would go again, but would prefer some place else because i'm not a big fan of italian food.", 
            "so good\n\nwe came here after an extremely long day and everyone left stuffed and happy. they told us everything is made from scratch, so they will accommodate any substitutions.\n\nwe started with the <mark>Calamari Fritt</mark> and the <mark>Stuffed Mushrooms</mark>. i hate mushrooms, but everyone else said they were the best they'd ever had. \n\ni had the chef's favorite famous rigatoni d (without mushrooms of course) and it was crazy good. anything with caramelized onions is good by me. my bf got the lobster baked tilapia and we were really amazed at the generous amount of lobster on top. he was in heaven! our friend got the gnocci and loved it, my parents both got parmesan crusted tilapia and were going crazy for it. \n\ni've done the family style dinner before and it's definitely worth it. the only reason we didn't do it this time is because we didn't have a fridge in our hotel room.", 
            "on my last outing to this venerable restaurant overlooking the strip on the edge of fashion show, maggiano's redeemed itself with a fine repast and picturesque view of encore.  our telephoned request for a booth with a strip view was honored despite the chagrined look of other hopefuls whom the maitre d' had to fend off to preserve our pre-reserved perch.  golden <mark>Calamari Fritt</mark> was on point and well made this time.  both rings and tentacles were lightly deep fried and excellent with great requested lemon aioli and mild marinara sauce.  bread and butter were very good, and, as always, a bowl of savory tuscan orzo & sausage soup sporting <mark>Gnocchi & Italian Sausage</mark>, fennel, white beans, fresh tomatoes, and plenty of orzo was excellent.  where this soup is concerned, to enjoy more stomach-warming, fluid rustic goodness i now always order a bowl rather than a mere cup.\n\na side <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> with grated parmesan and focaccia croutons in a creamy caesar dressing was excellent.  and, stuffed chicken pizzaiola with mozzarella, ricotta, tropheo pasta, pomodoro, red peppers, and pepperoncini was fine once i got to the middle of the chicken.  it was similar to chicken cordon bleu but zestier.  as usual, a side of fontina potatoes was creamy and delicious.  \n\nthis time we experienced excellent service as noel, our server, without any prodding, carefully spaced out our meal orders so that the various dishes would not come out of the kitchen on top of each other.  all went well except for me killing one of my favorite polo shirts with food stains from marinara sauce followed by splatters from the orzo & sausage soup.  after treating the stubborn marks with both zout and goo gone, after six washings they still remain.  i will not give up either the sauce or the soup.  but next time i am in their close proximity, regardless of appearances i will don a napkin to protect the front of whatever shirt i may be wearing at the time!\n\nfor a chain, this is truly a fine one!", 
            "another night at maggiano's, and another excellent dinner!  \n\nwe started with fine complimentary warm bread and butter in our reserved booth with a window view of the strip, and moved on to enjoy outstanding <mark>Calamari Fritt</mark>--excellent tentacles and first-rate golden rings, along with the cheerfully provided lemon aioli we had requested to accompany marinara sauce.\n\na bowl of orzo & sausage soup was also well prepared and excellent as a whole,  with sausage just tangy enough to make it intriguing.  although iced teas regularly arrived unbidden, i had to ask for butter twice.  it was quickly produced after the second request.\n\ncold crisp romaine leaves bathed in a thin application of a nice traditional caesar dressing, and small crunchy croutons dominated an excellent side <mark>Caesar Salad</mark>.  belatedly i asked for a single anchovy (semi-health consciousness at work!) and it was duly brought in its own ceramic cup to further enhance this course. \n\ngreat cheesy fontina potatoes represented a perfect blend of cooked potato slices and fontina cheese, and were more than enough to share with diane.  this time my entree of linguini & clams was superb, with a fine light white wine sauce, 9 clams still in the beds of their opened shells, and a generous amount of supplemental chopped clams.  meanwhile, diane did her best to attack 3 large medallions of veal parm with excellent yummy alfredo sauce accompanied by al dente rigatoni alfredo.  at meal's end she still had enough food left over for a very satisfying lunch two days later, and we were both too full to order dessert.\n\nonce again i unintentionally dropped and left items under our dining table.  this time when i pulled up on the driveway of my north las vegas home, i found that both a filled pill case and all of my house keys were missing from my coat pocket.  after a call to the restaurant and a check under our former table by restaurant management, all items were found.  so, for the second time in 13 months after dining here, i headed back to fashion show mall, and retrieved my dropped items from the check-in desk.  they had been found on the floor of the same booth where my kindle had been inadvertently abandoned on a previous visit.  so, in the future i either have to avoid this particular booth or take better care of my important personal possessions.  i think i will concentrate on the latter course of action!", 
            "again, not impressed, although my dinner experience was a thousand times better than my solo lunch experience. i am not willing though to rate to a higher level as this dinner on many levels fell flat. i should have known, but kept my hopes up none the less. my husband and i were invited to a date night dinner here, so we went along for the ride.\n\nfirst off, service was a tad better this time around. our waiter was a bit of an odd-ball though. i have to give him props for getting me a cocktail in just in time for the happy hour price. he was also incredibly knowledgeable about the restaurant's extensive menu. happily telling us all kinds of things, including his opinion of the marsala sauce that is very unlike his italian grandmothers.\n\nappetizers:\n\n<mark>Calamari Fritt</mark>, served with marinara. it was fried calamari. luckily though it was not soggy or gross. it was fried up nicely and with a spritz of lemon and a bit of the sauce was a decent app. \n\nspinach & artichoke <mark>Mushroom Ravioli al Forno</mark> - i am a fan of artichokes in apps. my favorite though it basically just grilling the artichoke and serving it to me as is. however, i was not impressed with this dip. it is baked in an asiago and alfedo-like cheese sauce and it just did not have any zing to make it any better than any other spinach dip i have had.\n\ncrab & shrimp cannelloni ($18.50) - ugh! what a waste of money. this dish came out in a pool of cheese sauce. literally, the entire plate was cheese sauce. the menu description says this, \"asiago cheese sauce and breadcrumbs\". no. there were no breadcrumbs. my plate was a goopy pile of cheese sauce, with three lone cannellonis that had, perhaps, 4-5 pieces of shrimp. the peppers included did not enhance the meal one bit. the cannelloni was soggy and unappetizing and the crab meat inside was like a wet mop, just smooshy and gross. i was incredibly disappointed in this dish.\n\ni wish i had gotten the spaghetti and meat sauce, which is what my husband got, and he cleaned his plate!\n\ncreme brulee ($7.95) - a huge portion of creme brulee served in a trough. okay, i'm just kidding it wasn't served in a trough, but it might as well have been. the dessert portions are large, so ya know, share. my husband had one spoonful of the creme brulee and i was left to eat the rest of it.\n\nagain, as an overall opinion - it's over-priced, over-salted, overly-hyped italian food on the strip. it's a chain italian restaurant i will continue to avoid.", 
            "it was new year's day, and another visit to maggiano's.  this dinner really started the year off right!  \n\nrustic bread was very good, and golden <mark>Calamari Fritt</mark> was again excellent alternately dipped in a specially requested lemon aioli, along with a mild marinara sauce.  a filling bowl of <mark>Tuscan Chicken Sausage</mark> & orzo soup was outstanding, and a small chopped <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> with a light and delicious creamy caesar dressing, big crunchy croutons, and parmesan splinters was nice and cool.\n\nalthough we had to ask for one round of water refills, and meat sauce was first mistakenly brought to diane's side of our booth, these minor lapses were quickly corrected, and otherwise service was excellent, as is usually the case here.  my entree of spaghetti & meatball in meat sauce was very fine indeed, with a large dense meatball, al dente spaghetti, and a mild sweet sauce.  for diane, roasted red potatoes served on request in lieu of pasta were simply prepared and excellent tasting.  i asked for a few mushrooms to be added to my meat sauce, and they were.  there was no charge levied for this or the aioli, although i would have gladly paid for these graciously given extras.\n\nonce again, five-star dining--on a holiday, when expectations are highest.  this time they were even exceeded!", 
            "good solid italian food.  we had eaten here once before, again with some of our kids.\n\nthe food was very good.  as described in the menu, except the dressing on the salad was extremely salty; we all agreed that if we ordered that salad again, no dressing (or on the side).  the prawns in their signature red sauce were generous in portion size, and excellent.  the <mark>Calamari Fritt</mark> (sp?) were also very good.  the wine list, while not huge, had some very good values.\n\nservice was a bit uneven, though always friendly and apologetic with regard to forgotten items.  would eat here again, but order a bit different.", 
            "another year later, and another new year's day meal at maggiano's--this time with friends.  food was as fine as usual, but this time there were just too many service errors to overlook.  i had to separately ask for more bread three times, and butter another three times before they were finally produced.  a table knife was taken away without substituting a replacement, and no serving spoon was provided for potatoes.  so one star was lost.\n\ncomplimentary italian bread had a nice doughy texture.  <mark>Calamari Fritt</mark> with marinara sauce and specially requested lemon aioli featured perfectly cooked golden tentacles and rings.  and mozzarella marinara consisted of four rectangles of slightly browned fried cheese.  \n\na side <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> with requested anchovies was crunchy and excellent.  and a bowl of <mark>Tuscan Chicken Sausage</mark> soup was very good except for hard included celery.  fontina potatoes were oozing with white cheese, and my entree of linguine & clams with white clam sauce, 12 littleneck clams in open shells, and several pieces of chopped clams was quite delicious.", 
            "thank you maggiano's  for making my moms birthday dinner special ! the manager jesse was friendly , helpful and came to our table personally to make sure we were okay . our waiter nick was  professional and knowledgeable about the menu and what to suggest , an absolute delight ! we got the <mark>Calamari Fritt</mark> , <mark><mark><mark>Chicken Parmesan</mark></mark></mark> , veal marsala , <mark>Chopped Salad</mark> with chicken  and the nonna's pound cake  for dessert !  dinner was delicious and the service was superb !"

            "i'm not big on chain restaurants but maggiano's is my fav italian spot!  i've never had a bad experience at the woodland hills location in ca and lv did not disappoint. the food is always great and so is the service.  i've tried a lot of the appies and my favs are the calamari, <mark>Stuffed Mushrooms</mark> and the shrimp oreganata! awesome!  i love the four cheese ravioli with the pesto alfredo.  as rachel says...yum-o!  the maggiano's <mark>Chopped Salad</mark> is also great.  \n\nthis place all in all is great for groups or even a nice dinner with bf.  keep it up maggiano's!", 
            "i love maggiano's!! it is great for big parties. my family and i are a huge fan of the family style lunch. \n\nhttp://www.maggianos.com/foodbeverage/default.asp?menu=family%20style%20lunch\n\nyou get two choices of appetizers, salads, pastas, entrees and desserts. they also refill the plates. so if you finish your appetizer, they'll give you another one and if you don't finish it they let you box it up. \n\nmy favorites are the <mark>Calamari Fritt</mark>, <mark>Stuffed Mushrooms</mark> and the tiramisu!!!\n\neveryone in the world needs to celebrate one event in their life at maggiano's. it is totally worth the price.", 
            "i was craving pasta for dinner after the crap i ate at todd english's olives, so we wandered over from the wynn and found this place. <mark>Stuffed Mushrooms</mark> were amazing! the <mark>Spinach Salad</mark> was really good and the lobster ravioli was good. it had big chunks of lobster in it, but the cream sauce could have been better.. still yummy though.", 
            "calamari = bomb\n<mark>Stuffed Mushrooms</mark> = bomb\nveal parmesan = solid\nlasagna = pretty interesting taste... has an <mark>Gnocchi & Italian Sausage</mark> kick to it\nwaiter was cool and made good suggestions as well", 
            "honestly, why have i not found this chain sooner!?\n\nmaggiano's was my favorite place of my vegas trip. i must admit, it was slightly biased- i was part of an organization, and the organization catered the food.. so i had, literally, had a ton of food. nonetheless, it was the best way to try the food!\n\nfirst, the appetizers came out. after having the appetizers, i was pretty set on making that my lunch! there was bruschetta, <mark>Tomato Caprese</mark>, two types of salad, but my favorite was the <mark>Stuffed Mushrooms</mark>. oh man, so good. i was trying to be all professional at this lunch, but all i really wanted to do was to just take the plate of mushrooms and eat off the plate. it was so juicy and flavorful! \n\nnext, came the actual entrees. after filling up on the mushrooms and good salads, i was about stuffed already. the entrees were all really good as well! there was the four cheese ravioli (mmm, def was one of my faves!), herb chicken, pork medallions (also, one of my faves!), some pasta + vodka dish, and some great tasting beef. it was all really really good.\n\nwhat really topped the meal off (well, any meal for all i'm concerned about) was the desserts. first, these gigantic profiteroles came out, made out of huge biscuits and lots of ice cream. but, my favorite of all time came out.. the tiramisu!! as tiramisu is my all time favorite dessert, i had high expectations of this dessert.. and it was met. it was the right amount of lightness and the cheese was just right.. i was in heaven. \n\nour waiter was great as well, explaining every item he brought out and was prompt on filling our drinks. he even answered nicely to all my curious questions of, \"so... what exactly is that? what is it cooked in?\" etc. \n\nperhaps my view was slightly biased as i did not even have to pay for this lunch, but all i know, is the food was great, and i would love to find a maggiano's close to me! mmm. :)", 
            "service was iffy. we dd the \"light family\" buffet, which included 2 appetizers, 2 salad, 2 pasta choices and lemon cookies. we ordered the calamari with warm mainara sauce and <mark>Stuffed Mushrooms</mark>. for the salad we ordered the cesar and chopped (bacon pieces, nano bits of avocado, tomato, and greens). as for the pastas, we ordered chicken linguini and another one, which i forgot. initially the purpose of doing the family style buffet was to get the unlimited refills, but our waiter was quite stingy with it. \n\nhmm, overall verdict?? after going on a strict heavy pasta diet, i wasn't really a big fan of this heavy strict pasta meal. maybe one day i'll give it another shot and the ratings will be better.", 
            "after i left this place i felt very fat.  that's a good thing!  anyways, we ordered 2 appetizers and 2 entrees just for my wife and i.  big mistake!  we should definately shared a entree.  the portions were huge!  we had the <mark>Stuffed Mushrooms</mark> and mussles for the appetizers.  they were great.  i had the chicken parm and she had the chicken marsala.  they were bothe great also.   but like i said, we should of just shared a entree.", 
            "breaking news: notorious italian cuisine hater, archie g., had italian food for dinner and didn't immediately want to vomit afterwards.\n\non a business trip in las vegas, my speaking manager (who does not speak spanish) asked me to help him take out our large limited our latin american distributors (who don't speak english) for dinner. somehow, i was put in charge of finding a restaurant suitable for all four of us. normally, i shy away from huge responsibility at work. i avoid the break room so i don't have to ever have to take out the trash. that's just how lazy i am.\n\nanyway, with this language challenged arrangement, i knew it was going to be up to me (and my two years of spanish in college) to keep the dinner engaging, organized, and running smoothly. luckily for me, maggiano's helped out with the experience.\n\nthe two chilean clients communicated to me that they loved steak and italian food. with the help of my yelp blackberry application, i suggested benihana or maggiano's (and tried not show sadness in my eyes). ironically, their eyes lit up when they heard maggiano's and the date was set.\n\nfor starters, the staff here is a superb. the hostess helped me make a reservation for a couple hours later, so i was able to give the rest of the dinner participants time to get ready, as i ran off and went shopping for a little gift for la novia at the nearby mall. our server was awesome. how lucky was i that the server was chilean? he helped out immensely making our chilean clients feel comfortable, recommending dishes and beers, and making on occasional joke or two. great guy. great server. give that guy a raise.\n\nas for the food, it wasn't terrible. we had the \"all you can eat family style\" meal, which included two salads, two appetizers, four main courses, and two desserts to share (and share and share) until we were ready to be wheeled out of the restaurant.\n\nappetizers: we had the \"<mark>Calamari Fritt</mark>\" and \"<mark>Stuffed Mushrooms</mark>.\" the fried calamari was average and the dipping sauce was essentially ragu. i liked the <mark>Stuffed Mushrooms</mark> and so did the rest of the group as had another round of it. however, i did wonder why they were not given an italian name on the menu. maybe the guy who wrote the menu only took 2 years of italian in college?\n\nsalads: the \"<mark>Chopped Salad</mark>\" was a eally good salad. there is no way it can be good for you.  we also had the \"<mark>Italian Tossed Salad</mark>\" and it was wonderful. who doesn't love a good <mark>Italian Tossed Salad</mark> by an italian?\n\nmain courses: we ordered 4 different main courses. the \"spaghetti, meatball\" and i could have made it better at home. the \"veal ravioli\" was pretty good. it wasn't as heavy as i had imagined. the \"gnocchi, tomato vodka sauce\" was my contribution to the group. the gnocchi just melted in your mouth. it was the best dish all night and we had another round of it. the \"the \"salmon, lemon & herb\" smelled pretty bad. i was afraid to get that on my lips or fingers. i didn't want la novia to pick me up from the airport and think i was having an affair or something.\n\ndesserts: the cr\\u00e8me brulee was pretty good. we had three rounds of this. i love burnt cream. we had the \"n.y. style cheesecake\" and it well, it was just plain ol' cheesecake. i think the \"n.y.\" stood for \"not your.\" as in, \"not your style cheesecake.\"\n\noverall, the food was up and down and mostly mediocre. it was factory style italian food that lacked much distinctive flavor. essentially, it was a pricier version of \"olive garbage\" or \"bucket of crappo.\"\n\nthis was no more than 2 to 2.5 star food. but the ambiance and staff helped make this a very successful business dinner. so successful, we went out on the town for an adventure that included gambling, karaoke, and general las vegas debauchery.\n\nand well, i will award another star for that.", 
            "i was introduced to this restaurant when i use to work in the oc.  i love this chain compared to olive garden.  every time i have been to a maggiano's whether it is oc or here, i always seem to wait a little.  just my luck probably.  we like the atmosphere and the food is good.  below are the usual that we order:\n\nappetizers: bruschetta, <mark>Stuffed Mushrooms</mark>\npastas: <mark>Spaghetti & Meatball</mark>, <mark>Fettuccine Alfredo</mark>, lasagna\ndesserts: creme brulee, tiramisu\n\npastas are very well prepared as well, but our favorites that keep us coming back are the appetizers and desserts.\n\nthis is definitely one of my favorite restaurants to go to.\n\nthe only thing that was a turn off for us for this location was that the outdoor dining we had to put up with someone that was smoking at a nearby table.  we have kids so this was rather inconvenient.",

            "the ambiance was my favorite part.  we made reservations around 6:30 pm on saturday.  the earliest seating was at 9:15 pm.  we arrived at the fashion show mall, parked, and wondered our way out front to the entrance of maggiano's.  i always love the atmosphere in these kind of places.  i'm not a big fan of italian food, so don't read too much into my comments about the food.  the <mark>Calamari Fritt</mark> was a bit greasy with too much oil, but was overall pretty good.  the marinara dipping sauce was superb.  we also had <mark>Stuffed Mushrooms</mark>, which were really good.  they were stuffed with spinach and topped with seasoned bread crumbs and served in a garlic white wine sauce.  my fiance and i shared a bowl of linguine di mare.  it had lobster, shrimp, clams, & mussels with noodles in a spicy lobster tomato broth.  it was pretty good.  lots of meat.  very filling.  a man with a guitar and another man with an accordion serenaded us with a romantic italian song.  simply romantic.  we had nice seats facing las vegas boulevard.  we lingered a while after paying the bill, but the server stopped refilling our water.  this bothered me a little.  i was unusually thirsty and could not seem to get enough.  the bill was almost $60.  we had to take an alternate route back to the car because the fashion show mall was closed.  i enjoyed this experience and would go again, but would prefer some place else because i'm not a big fan of italian food.", 
            "when it comes to vegas restaurants, this would not have been my first choice. there is one near my house and i prefer to eat at places i have never been while i am on vacation, but it was my friends birthday dinner. we had a party of 11, so we had to order off the family style menu. we looked at the menu in advance so we already knew what we would be getting when we got there. we ordered the fried mozzarella and <mark>Stuffed Mushrooms</mark> to start. for entrees we ordered a lobster carbonara, <mark><mark><mark>Chicken Parmesan</mark></mark></mark>, beef medallions and a bow tie pasta. we thought we would get one plate of each, but they brought 2 of each, one for each end of the table.  we where well fed. dessert was my favorite. house made terramissu and apple cobbler. wonderful! \n\nour server was wonderful too. she was very friendly and attentive. our drinks never ran dry. it was a great experience. =)", 
            "after walking for what seemed hours(and probably was), my family and i decided to eat here.  it's conveniently located in the fashion show mall...so after a day's shopping and gambling at the nearby venetian and palazzo...some italian food sounded good.\nwe went around 3pm, so it was not crowded at all.  we were immediately seated and service was prompt.  \nthe appetizer we chose which was <mark>Stuffed Mushrooms</mark> was quite delicious and i would order these again.\nmy dish was a shrimp risotto which wasn't a part of the regular menu, but a special they had.  i thought it was good, but it didn't \"wow\" me.  i probably wouldn't order it again.\nmy mom had a beef tenderloin dish...and because she invariably cannot finish her meal, she offered some to me.  i found the beef to be very good, and in fact wished i had ordered that instead.\nmy brother ordered a lobster carbonara dish which he was disappointed with because they mistakenly did not put bacon in the dish...even though it is listed and most carbonara's should have it.  i got a bite of the lobster in it and thought it was okay.\noverall, the meal was good and i would probably eat here again, but would try another dish.  the prices here are not too bad.  about $60 for three of us including appetizer and drinks.",

            "oh boy. this was probably my best meal during my stay in vegas. the food here is breathtakingly good, particularly the appetizers. get the <mark>Stuffed Mushrooms</mark>; you will thank me. the bruschetta is also worth mentioning; i guarantee you'll be asking for more bread to scoop up the abundance of tasty tomatoes. for dinner, i had the chicken marsala which was very good. my boyfriend got chicken franchise which (according to him) was decent. the potatoes and salad that his meal came with were excellent. our waiter was very sweet. everything, for me, was truly above average. i hope the maggiano's in the tri-state are equally amazing.", 
            "what a great spot in vegas.  it may be a chain, but its run like its an original. great service and decor.  food was pretty good as well.  the gf and i got bruschetta and <mark>Stuffed Mushrooms</mark> for apps.  both were great!  for dinner the gf went with chicken marsala and i with the francaise.  both came with sides.   i opted for the fried potatoes and she for the linguine with garlic and oil.  i threw in a side of broccolini to have a nice lil veggie in the mix.\n\nwell 1 - 10:\napps 10\nmarsala 7 - salty but good.\nfrancaise 5 - it wasn't bad, but i have had much better and expected more.\nling with g&o - 2  no taste at all\npotatoes - 7\nbroccolini - 10 nicely cooked and seasoned in garlic and oil\n\nthe menu is very extensive and overall it was a great time with the gf.  i am looking forward to checking out the maggiano's in north jersey.", 
            "disclaimer: the only time i come here is for large birthday gatherings featuring: (1) the extremely young; and (2) the extremely old.  i've never independently chosen to eat here.\n\ni will say they have their sh$t together when it comes to large private gatherings.  they're always well staffed and organized, unlike other spots in town (*cough* pj clarkes *cough*).  the private rooms are also spacious and feature large windows -- you're not in some afterthought back room.\n\nfurther, the portions they provide for groups are enormous.  even if there are 10 people at a table, it never runs out.  in fact, i usually get stuck with taking home leftovers.  just what i always wanted, 4 lbs of artichoke dip......\n\nbut, large portions aren't really a godsend if the food is just meh.  i've had the chicken & <mark>Baked Eggplant Parmesan</mark>, chicken piccata, penne with meat sauce, spagetti, <mark>Caesar Salad</mark>, <mark>Stuffed Mushrooms</mark>, calamari, profiteroles and...... none of it was memorable. \n\noverall, they serve up very basic italian food meant to please the masses......something easily achieved when the patrons are seven-years-old.....", 
            "i was instantly alarmed when we were seated and i saw food stuck on the empty wine glass in front of me. i could hardly place a drink order with the server because i was so fixated on this overlooked problem. only compounding the unease, we were placed on the edge of the aisle, the front legs of my chair were on a carpeted area and the back in the aisle ... so i always felt like i was about to fall off my chair. (and this was before the wine!) \n\nour server was curt and lacked warmth. i think this may have been the result of me being sucked into the tractor beam of the dirty wine glass when i was ordering. we had to ask twice for butter (over evoo). however, we were truly glad this restaurant was open so late! (most every sit-down establishment was was closed except buca and maggiano's). \n\nwhile it is chain food and has that \"chain\" quality (frozen), it is still filling and occasionally tasty. if you are a vegetarian, be careful! many of the appetizers (like the <mark>Stuffed Mushrooms</mark>) and entrees use chicken-stock for flavor (which is not posted on the menu). we discovered this \"the hard way.\" ask your server for guidance.\n\nmaggiano's receives high-marks from us for being open late in this city that seems to close-down everything but the casinos after 10:30. nonetheless, the walk to the deserted fashion mall (at this hour) is truly harrowing (we saw no security in this area whatsoever) so go in a large, alert group. seriously.", 
            "it's safe to say, i'm a maggiano's regular. & i think the vegas location is probably the best one- overlooking the strip, yet safely located in the fashion show mall & not quite 'on the strip'. fun for people watching during the day (love sitting outside, if not too cold, hot or windy!) then transforms at nite when the 2 windowed walls facing the strip allow you to dine alongside the buzz & beauty of the vegas lights. while ambiance is a factor in why i like maggiano's, consistency is the reason i go back time & time again. i don't believe i've ever had a bad meal or experience there (other than occasionally being sardined on busier nites). unbeknownst to me, at some point, maggiano's even changed ownership; i couldn't tell, because unlike other cases when there's an ownership change, nothing about the quality changed. i'm part of their email list so i get emails with coupons every couple months. a few no-fails on the menu: <mark>Tomato Caprese</mark>, <mark>Stuffed Mushrooms</mark>, rigatoni d (though not great for leftovers, because of the cream sauce), <mark>Mom's Lasagna</mark> (had it for the 1st time last nite & it's one of the best, not too mushy), eggplant parm (generous portion), the best chicken parm i've ever graced my mouth with & linguine di mare (substantial seafood). for dessert, if you're still feeling gluttonous, go for the apple crostada... otherwise, we generally get the kids scoop of vanilla bean icecream with hot fudge. also, keep maggiano's in mind for thanksgiving & christmas dining, if you're in town visiting or if you just don't feel like cooking- they do a wonderful job with the menus & you'll surely have leftovers, for a reasonable price. it's easy to mosey in & be seated right away for lunch but i recommend reservations for any time after 4:00.", 
            "we dined here last night with a party of 10.  ordered the family style dinner and were very impressed.  brandon took very good care of us the whole night.  we were never rushed and the food just keep coming.  the <mark>Chopped Salad</mark> was great along with the <mark>Stuffed Mushrooms</mark>.   dinner was <mark>Baked Eggplant Parmesan</mark>, salmon, chicken picata and sausage with gnocchi which all were excellent.  one of our diners had some dietary issues and they were very attentive to her.  dessert was amazing my favorite being the apple pie.  everyone in our party was very impressed!", 
            "i've actually been to maggiano's a few times and when i did it was amazing!  the food, the atmosphere, the service was phenomenal!  however, this review will be on my recent visit, just a couple days ago.\n\nme and my boyfriend decided to go for lunch here to celebrate on him getting a potential new job.  in the beginning, everything was fine.  we ordered our appetizers and... that was it?  he didn't ask if we'd like an entree after taking down our appetizers.  so, we waited for our server to come back and ask if we'd like to order an entree.  after he gave us our appetizer and even finished it, all we saw  him do was helping every other customers but us.  did he have something against us because we \"look\" 16 years old and can't afford an entree???  after about 20-30 minutes of waiting, we asked another server to ask him if he can take down our entree we've been waiting for.  he comes over and he goes, \"okay go ahead.\"  he didn't apologize for making us wait.  really??  wow.  i'm appalled by his performance.  and after we got our entree, he only came over to us twice, third time being check, and we never saw him again.\n\nthe saving grace to our experience was the food.  our appetizers were the <mark>Crispy Zucchini Fritt</mark> and <mark>Stuffed Mushrooms</mark>.  i loved how crunchy the zucchini was and the soupy base for the mushroom was great!  our entrees were the rigatoni d and <mark><mark><mark>Chicken Parmesan</mark></mark></mark>.  he enjoyed his parmesan very much and the rigatoni was very fulfilling and the cream sauce complimented the whole dish so well!  the little mushrooms in it was too cute to eat!\n\nwe're always going to come back here.  just not have that older server again.", 
            "my friends & i had a very pleasant dining experience here when they rented out one of the private rooms at maggiano's as the lunch reception for their 10-year wedding vow renewal. we had 3 tables that seated about 10-12 people. there was plenty of room for a display table as well. and there was also an adjacent balcony with a view of the strip & encore. they had a specially tailored menu with their names on it as well as at the door upon entering the room (we had to correct them on the spelling when we arrived & they corrected it before the families arrived). overall the service and the experience was a positive one. i think it's safe to say the guests & celebrants enjoyed their time at maggiano's. i'd advise you to valet outside because the elevator by valet takes you right up to restaurant. my friend that lives in town gave me that nugget of information. so convenient...\n\nnow on to the menu: first course was <mark>Stuffed Mushrooms</mark>, calamari & <mark>Italian Tossed Salad</mark>. the <mark>Stuffed Mushrooms</mark> were good. they were big mushrooms and it was stuffed with spinach and bread crumbs. they were served in a white wine sauce. you cant go wrong with calamari and their version didn't disappoint. fresh tasting pieces of breaded squid accompanied with marinara sauce for dipping. just squeeze some lemon over the calamari and you're golden. the <mark>Italian Tossed Salad</mark> was surprisingly delicious. salad had arugula, lettuce, pepperoncinis & croutons in italian dressing. good appetizers. i enjoyed every single one of them. \n\nsecond course consisted of meat lasagna, rustic chicken & shrimp and chicken marsala. i loved the meat lasagna. but really, what's not to love? it's lasagna! and it was classically delicious. they don't call it \"mom's meat lasagna with meat sauce\" for nothing. crumbled <mark>Meatball</mark> & sausage with ricotta cheese. boom! i didnt have the rustic chicken & shrimp but my friend's seemed to like it. the chicken marsala was so very good. white meat chicken that was so moist and tasty. it was the perfect chicken dish. i loved it the most... and that's saying a lot given that lasagna was on the menu. order it. trust me.\n\nfor dessert, we had 2 offerings. chocolate zucotto cake & nonna's toasted pound cake. all i had was the toasted pound cake & that's all i needed. it was so damn good. crispy edges on the pound cake topped with a scoop of vanilla bean ice cream, slivers of chocolate and served along side caramelized bananas. game over. i dont have to tell you how good it was. you already know. \n\nyou're welcome...",

            "honestly, why have i not found this chain sooner!?\n\nmaggiano's was my favorite place of my vegas trip. i must admit, it was slightly biased- i was part of an organization, and the organization catered the food.. so i had, literally, had a ton of food. nonetheless, it was the best way to try the food!\n\nfirst, the appetizers came out. after having the appetizers, i was pretty set on making that my lunch! there was bruschetta, <mark>Tomato Caprese</mark>, two types of salad, but my favorite was the <mark>Stuffed Mushrooms</mark>. oh man, so good. i was trying to be all professional at this lunch, but all i really wanted to do was to just take the plate of mushrooms and eat off the plate. it was so juicy and flavorful! \n\nnext, came the actual entrees. after filling up on the mushrooms and good salads, i was about stuffed already. the entrees were all really good as well! there was the four cheese ravioli (mmm, def was one of my faves!), herb chicken, pork medallions (also, one of my faves!), some pasta + vodka dish, and some great tasting beef. it was all really really good.\n\nwhat really topped the meal off (well, any meal for all i'm concerned about) was the desserts. first, these gigantic profiteroles came out, made out of huge biscuits and lots of ice cream. but, my favorite of all time came out.. the tiramisu!! as tiramisu is my all time favorite dessert, i had high expectations of this dessert.. and it was met. it was the right amount of lightness and the cheese was just right.. i was in heaven. \n\nour waiter was great as well, explaining every item he brought out and was prompt on filling our drinks. he even answered nicely to all my curious questions of, \"so... what exactly is that? what is it cooked in?\" etc. \n\nperhaps my view was slightly biased as i did not even have to pay for this lunch, but all i know, is the food was great, and i would love to find a maggiano's close to me! mmm. :)",

            "took a recent trip to vegas and after walking around starving me and my bf decided to try out maggiano's.  the ambiance is beautiful with rich furnishings and amazing views of the strip. bread is brought to the table with butter, but there is also olive oil on the table if you prefer to dip with that. we started with an appetizer of <mark>Tomato Caprese</mark> that was very good, next we shared the smaller version of the <mark>Spinach Salad</mark> that was amazing (bacon, pine nuts, super yummy dressing etc), and finally we split a plate of the <mark><mark><mark>Chicken Parmesan</mark></mark></mark> that was a large portion, so big in fact we ended up taking the rest to go in a box. in total, those 3 dishes 1 water and 1 coke was $37 which i thought was very reasonable. the sever was friendly, prompt and attentive. there was also a man with a guitar that would sing you a song at the time if you would like. overall i liked the mood of the restaurant, the romantic feel, delicious food and wonderful service. no complaints.", 
            "3 1/2 - 4 ****\nlocated in the fashion show mall, tons of parking and glass windows to enjoy the scenery.  \nreservations highly recommended as it can get very busy. \n\ni've eaten here several times and for some reason i keep coming back.  it must be the large portions and great service. \n\nfood: \n<mark>Spinach Salad</mark>- tender leaf spinach tossed with diced red peppers, roasted red onions and gorgonzola cheese, yummy applewood smoked bacon, toasted pine nuts and apple cider vinaigrette. \n<mark>Tomato Caprese</mark>-sliced tomatoes topped with fresh mozzarella and basil, drizzled with a balsamic glaze and crispy calamari. \n\ndinner: \nlobster carbonara- it  was dry so i would never order it again. \n<mark>Mom's Lasagna</mark> with meat sauce\nbeef tenderloin medallions\n\nit' really not a bad place despite of what others has said.   to me it's reasonably priced, service was great and i love the complimentary bread.", 
            "it's safe to say, i'm a maggiano's regular. & i think the vegas location is probably the best one- overlooking the strip, yet safely located in the fashion show mall & not quite 'on the strip'. fun for people watching during the day (love sitting outside, if not too cold, hot or windy!) then transforms at nite when the 2 windowed walls facing the strip allow you to dine alongside the buzz & beauty of the vegas lights. while ambiance is a factor in why i like maggiano's, consistency is the reason i go back time & time again. i don't believe i've ever had a bad meal or experience there (other than occasionally being sardined on busier nites). unbeknownst to me, at some point, maggiano's even changed ownership; i couldn't tell, because unlike other cases when there's an ownership change, nothing about the quality changed. i'm part of their email list so i get emails with coupons every couple months. a few no-fails on the menu: <mark>Tomato Caprese</mark>, <mark>Stuffed Mushrooms</mark>, rigatoni d (though not great for leftovers, because of the cream sauce), <mark>Mom's Lasagna</mark> (had it for the 1st time last nite & it's one of the best, not too mushy), eggplant parm (generous portion), the best chicken parm i've ever graced my mouth with & linguine di mare (substantial seafood). for dessert, if you're still feeling gluttonous, go for the apple crostada... otherwise, we generally get the kids scoop of vanilla bean icecream with hot fudge. also, keep maggiano's in mind for thanksgiving & christmas dining, if you're in town visiting or if you just don't feel like cooking- they do a wonderful job with the menus & you'll surely have leftovers, for a reasonable price. it's easy to mosey in & be seated right away for lunch but i recommend reservations for any time after 4:00."

            "i came here a couple months ago during my vacation in las vegas. i was skeptical to try maggiano's out since they were a chain restaurant but i would be pleasantly surprised. unfortunately no locations in canada (where i'm from) yet! this maggianos is located in the fashion show mall next to wynn and encore hotels. \n\nmaggiano's isn't exactly fine-dining, but it does have a pretty nice ambiance for a family style restaurant. it has full panoramic glass windows around the perimeter of the dining room, showcasing an awesome view of the wynn hotel and that part of the strip. while we were there, two violinists went around the restaurant playing songs for each table. and to top it off, our server was so kind and helpful!\n\nthe menu here is also pretty interesting and worth a mention. along side the regular a la cart menu, they also have a \"family style\" menu. basically you choose several items from a predetermined set, and for a fixed price per pereson, you can order as much of any item you want! its kind of like \"all-you-can-eat\" but for only the few items you choose. we ended up going for this option and ordered the light family dinner that comes with bottomless portions for 2 appetizers, 2 salads, and 2 pastas.\n\n<mark>Maggiano's Salad</mark> : \nthis salad is literally the best salad i've ever had! the signature house dressing was a spicy-sweet vinaigrette, and paired with the crunchy prosciutto bits, i could not for the life of me stop eating this!\n\n<mark>Crispy Zucchini Fritt</mark> : \nthe waiter said this was their most popular appetizer, and i can see why. the zucchinis are deep fried in a crumbly crunchy batter, and were irresistible with the cool ranch dip\n\nlinguine and clams with white clam sauce: \ni did not like this at all. the sauce was runny, and tasted like fishy sea water. it was way too salty.\n\nour famous rigatoni 'd' \\u00ae :\n guess they don't call it \"famous\" for nothing, this pasta is really really good! the pasta is cooked perfectly al dente, and is served with lots of mushrooms and creamy marsala sauce. \n\nfor a chain, this place really isn't bad! you'll leave for the most part happy and full :)", 
            "best italian food i've ever had* (and i'm italian!)\n\nevery time my girlfriends and i visited las vegas we would come here at least twice (over a week holiday) to have dinner. i love that the restaurant serves up food family style (read: larger portions meant to be shared among family and/or friends) which is how italian people serve their meals at home to their own families. \n\nthe food is authentic, delicious and the servers always know their s***. i usually go for appetizers (caprese, <mark>Crispy Zucchini Fritt</mark>, mozzerella marinara)  and a main (ravioli, <mark>Baked Eggplant Parmesan</mark>, manicotti). one of my friends always raves about the <mark>Taylor Street Baked Ziti</mark>. \n\none of the best parts is that every time you ordered a main you could get a side of your choice of pasta  (from a list) with a choice of sauce for an extra 1 or 2$. we used to get this to go and eat it poolside the next afternoon for lunch. cheap (sweet, more shopping!) and delicious!!!! i even brought some home on the flight for friends and family once. \n\n*obviously not counting my relatives home-made italian cooking. and the food is on par with the food served at terroni in toronto, canada.", 
            "my what a difference a year makes...both in how i write yelp reviews and in my maggiano's experience. i was back at maggiano's for a private event and this time it was much better. yes, they serve the dishes family style. yes, you pay a slightly inflated price i attribute to the unofficial strip surcharge. you get past all that and you'll find some good food here. \n\non this occasion there was one item that had me going back for more: <mark>Crispy Zucchini Fritt</mark>. the zucchini is a diet killer. calorie counting? yeah, forget about that. just make sure you get yours before the rest of the table does. \n\nthe rest of the items i tried today were good, but there was nothing that warranted asking for a box to take it with me. the <mark>Fettuccine Alfredo</mark> was respectable, not the best i've ever had but it certainly was filling and i sneaked in a second small helping of it. the chicken piccata was actually disappointing. i masked my disappointment by having more <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> and where did that zucchini go again? \n\none note to the staff...the lemon cookies were too cold. but the apple crostada made me forget all about the cookies...\n\nas this was a business function, the maggiano's staff took great care of my needs and of everyone that i work with. all things considered 4 stars seems appropriate. \n\nalmost forgot to mention one more thing. the valet seems super slow here. if you're in a hurry to get somewhere else plan accordingly.", 
            "i've actually been to maggiano's a few times and when i did it was amazing!  the food, the atmosphere, the service was phenomenal!  however, this review will be on my recent visit, just a couple days ago.\n\nme and my boyfriend decided to go for lunch here to celebrate on him getting a potential new job.  in the beginning, everything was fine.  we ordered our appetizers and... that was it?  he didn't ask if we'd like an entree after taking down our appetizers.  so, we waited for our server to come back and ask if we'd like to order an entree.  after he gave us our appetizer and even finished it, all we saw  him do was helping every other customers but us.  did he have something against us because we \"look\" 16 years old and can't afford an entree???  after about 20-30 minutes of waiting, we asked another server to ask him if he can take down our entree we've been waiting for.  he comes over and he goes, \"okay go ahead.\"  he didn't apologize for making us wait.  really??  wow.  i'm appalled by his performance.  and after we got our entree, he only came over to us twice, third time being check, and we never saw him again.\n\nthe saving grace to our experience was the food.  our appetizers were the <mark>Crispy Zucchini Fritt</mark> and <mark>Stuffed Mushrooms</mark>.  i loved how crunchy the zucchini was and the soupy base for the mushroom was great!  our entrees were the rigatoni d and <mark><mark><mark>Chicken Parmesan</mark></mark></mark>.  he enjoyed his parmesan very much and the rigatoni was very fulfilling and the cream sauce complimented the whole dish so well!  the little mushrooms in it was too cute to eat!\n\nwe're always going to come back here.  just not have that older server again.", 
            "great atmosphere. for appetizer we had the <mark>Crispy Zucchini Fritt</mark> which was my husbands favorite. we also ordered a side of <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> which needed more dressing so we asked for more. we also ordered the <mark>Creamy Tomato Basil</mark> soup, not the best soup ive had, it's too watery and not enough of the tomato taste more basil. for our entree we got the chicken marsala the lighter version and my husband said the chicken was dried. i had the alfredo fettuccine with chicken. my alfredo sauce was alright, not my favorite i think olive garden has better alfredo fettuccine. overall not bad for lunch but for italian food it was decent price and the waitress was really nice!"

            "breaking news: notorious italian cuisine hater, archie g., had italian food for dinner and didn't immediately want to vomit afterwards.\n\non a business trip in las vegas, my speaking manager (who does not speak spanish) asked me to help him take out our large limited our latin american distributors (who don't speak english) for dinner. somehow, i was put in charge of finding a restaurant suitable for all four of us. normally, i shy away from huge responsibility at work. i avoid the break room so i don't have to ever have to take out the trash. that's just how lazy i am.\n\nanyway, with this language challenged arrangement, i knew it was going to be up to me (and my two years of spanish in college) to keep the dinner engaging, organized, and running smoothly. luckily for me, maggiano's helped out with the experience.\n\nthe two chilean clients communicated to me that they loved steak and italian food. with the help of my yelp blackberry application, i suggested benihana or maggiano's (and tried not show sadness in my eyes). ironically, their eyes lit up when they heard maggiano's and the date was set.\n\nfor starters, the staff here is a superb. the hostess helped me make a reservation for a couple hours later, so i was able to give the rest of the dinner participants time to get ready, as i ran off and went shopping for a little gift for la novia at the nearby mall. our server was awesome. how lucky was i that the server was chilean? he helped out immensely making our chilean clients feel comfortable, recommending dishes and beers, and making on occasional joke or two. great guy. great server. give that guy a raise.\n\nas for the food, it wasn't terrible. we had the \"all you can eat family style\" meal, which included two salads, two appetizers, four main courses, and two desserts to share (and share and share) until we were ready to be wheeled out of the restaurant.\n\nappetizers: we had the \"<mark>Calamari Fritt</mark>\" and \"<mark>Stuffed Mushrooms</mark>.\" the fried calamari was average and the dipping sauce was essentially ragu. i liked the <mark>Stuffed Mushrooms</mark> and so did the rest of the group as had another round of it. however, i did wonder why they were not given an italian name on the menu. maybe the guy who wrote the menu only took 2 years of italian in college?\n\nsalads: the \"<mark>Chopped Salad</mark>\" was a eally good salad. there is no way it can be good for you.  we also had the \"<mark>Italian Tossed Salad</mark>\" and it was wonderful. who doesn't love a good <mark>Italian Tossed Salad</mark> by an italian?\n\nmain courses: we ordered 4 different main courses. the \"spaghetti, meatball\" and i could have made it better at home. the \"veal ravioli\" was pretty good. it wasn't as heavy as i had imagined. the \"gnocchi, tomato vodka sauce\" was my contribution to the group. the gnocchi just melted in your mouth. it was the best dish all night and we had another round of it. the \"the \"salmon, lemon & herb\" smelled pretty bad. i was afraid to get that on my lips or fingers. i didn't want la novia to pick me up from the airport and think i was having an affair or something.\n\ndesserts: the cr\\u00e8me brulee was pretty good. we had three rounds of this. i love burnt cream. we had the \"n.y. style cheesecake\" and it well, it was just plain ol' cheesecake. i think the \"n.y.\" stood for \"not your.\" as in, \"not your style cheesecake.\"\n\noverall, the food was up and down and mostly mediocre. it was factory style italian food that lacked much distinctive flavor. essentially, it was a pricier version of \"olive garbage\" or \"bucket of crappo.\"\n\nthis was no more than 2 to 2.5 star food. but the ambiance and staff helped make this a very successful business dinner. so successful, we went out on the town for an adventure that included gambling, karaoke, and general las vegas debauchery.\n\nand well, i will award another star for that.", 
            "i got there prior to our reservation, so i sat at the bar for a drink, i was ignored for some time, even though there were a few people behind the bar, and the bar stools were half empty, so they weren't busy. guess they don't like tips.\nwe had a very large group so they had to split us into 2 different tables. they miss counted the seats and left one out, a friend grabbed a chair and added it to the table, but we still had to wait for extra settings and menus. it took a while to get drink orders in, but water was at the tables already. i got an arnold palmer with vodka, it was on the weak side but tasty. a friend got a coke and said it was flat.\n bread was served with plenty to go around. it was warm, soft and yummy. \ni got the <mark>Italian Tossed Salad</mark>, it was very average, the italian vinagrette was quite boring.\ni ordered the shrimp and crab cannelloni special, which i have had before, it was very good, lots of crab chunks and shrimp. some friends got the chicken parmesean, the portions are huge, but they loved the food as well. no one at our table had a complaint about the food.\nmost of us skipped desert. roving musicians entertained us while we digested and others finished up their sweets.\nbeautiful atmosphere, our waiter was great, food was pretty similar to most italian restaurants around.", 
            "i had dinner here with three co-workers last wednesday night (1/11/2012). the ambiance was nice and the wait staff very friendly and efficient. we ordered the family style dining option and the appetizers were excellent. we have the mozzarella marinara, spinach & artichoke <mark>Mushroom Ravioli al Forno</mark>, garlic bread focaccia, and <mark>Italian Tossed Salad</mark>. for dinner we ordered gnocchi & <mark>Gnocchi & Italian Sausage</mark>, <mark>Four-Cheese Ravioli</mark>, baked rigatoni pomodoro, and braised beef ravioli. the main dishes were overly sauced and the pasta was over cooked. i could not even eat the gnocchi...it was like eating balls of paste.\n\nthis restaurant is highly rated by many on yelp so it is possible we were just there on a bad night but i will find it hard to return after my last experience. i don't think that anyone in my group was terribly impressed.", 
            "i've heard about maggiano's for awhile and finally got the chance to eat at one of their restaurants when i was in vegas for business.  since there were 7 of us, we decided to order family style...  $31 a head and we choose two appetizers, two salads, two pastas, two entrees, and two desserts, all you can eat!\n\nwe ordered the calamari and mussels, chopped and <mark>Italian Tossed Salad</mark>, spaghetti and <mark>Meatball</mark> and linguine with clams (white sauce) the chicken marsala and tilapia, and the tiramisu and s'mores special dessert.  calamari was great, but i was a little disappointed in the mussels.  too many white beans in the mix for me.  the salads were good.  linguine was good and the <mark>Meatball</mark> on the spaghetti were huge! the tilapia wasn't too fishy and was nice and moist and we loved the chicken marsala.  both desserts were great as well.\n\nbig points for our waiter, noel, as well.  he was very helpful, professional, and attentive through our stay.  he encouraged us to eat more and even gave us many containers to take home our leftovers in.  the spaghetti and chicken marsala were still great the next day, as well as the desserts!", 
            "love their lighter fare option! while yes, maggianos is known for their large portions and ahem, rich (calorie laden) flavors, this was a nice surprise. i had the chicken piccata and thoroughly enjoyed it! i didn't think any of the flavor was lost, but yes, the portion was a bit smaller than what i'm used to there. however, it was still filling.\n\nhubby had the linguini de mare, which was really good (not lighter fare). we started with the maggiano salad (him) and <mark>Italian Tossed Salad</mark> (me) and both really enjoyed our respective orders.\n\nwe shared the toasted pound cake with caramelized bananas for dessert and it was deeeelish! \n\nour server was seidi and i highly recommend asking for her section. we eat out quite often and the service we experienced from her was the best we've had in a while!", 
            "my friends & i had a very pleasant dining experience here when they rented out one of the private rooms at maggiano's as the lunch reception for their 10-year wedding vow renewal. we had 3 tables that seated about 10-12 people. there was plenty of room for a display table as well. and there was also an adjacent balcony with a view of the strip & encore. they had a specially tailored menu with their names on it as well as at the door upon entering the room (we had to correct them on the spelling when we arrived & they corrected it before the families arrived). overall the service and the experience was a positive one. i think it's safe to say the guests & celebrants enjoyed their time at maggiano's. i'd advise you to valet outside because the elevator by valet takes you right up to restaurant. my friend that lives in town gave me that nugget of information. so convenient...\n\nnow on to the menu: first course was <mark>Stuffed Mushrooms</mark>, calamari & <mark>Italian Tossed Salad</mark>. the <mark>Stuffed Mushrooms</mark> were good. they were big mushrooms and it was stuffed with spinach and bread crumbs. they were served in a white wine sauce. you cant go wrong with calamari and their version didn't disappoint. fresh tasting pieces of breaded squid accompanied with marinara sauce for dipping. just squeeze some lemon over the calamari and you're golden. the <mark>Italian Tossed Salad</mark> was surprisingly delicious. salad had arugula, lettuce, pepperoncinis & croutons in italian dressing. good appetizers. i enjoyed every single one of them. \n\nsecond course consisted of meat lasagna, rustic chicken & shrimp and chicken marsala. i loved the meat lasagna. but really, what's not to love? it's lasagna! and it was classically delicious. they don't call it \"mom's meat lasagna with meat sauce\" for nothing. crumbled <mark>Meatball</mark> & sausage with ricotta cheese. boom! i didnt have the rustic chicken & shrimp but my friend's seemed to like it. the chicken marsala was so very good. white meat chicken that was so moist and tasty. it was the perfect chicken dish. i loved it the most... and that's saying a lot given that lasagna was on the menu. order it. trust me.\n\nfor dessert, we had 2 offerings. chocolate zucotto cake & nonna's toasted pound cake. all i had was the toasted pound cake & that's all i needed. it was so damn good. crispy edges on the pound cake topped with a scoop of vanilla bean ice cream, slivers of chocolate and served along side caramelized bananas. game over. i dont have to tell you how good it was. you already know. \n\nyou're welcome...", 
            "impressive impressive... this is rock solid italian comfort food for sure.  couples night out and we opted for the family style menu options, for a party of four you can pick three starters, four main dishes and two desserts.  we selected the mozzarella, calamari and <mark>Italian Tossed Salad</mark>, all three items were great and plentiful.  the fried mozzarella was my favorite one but the salad and dressing were just as good.  for entrees we ordered all pasta items with the standouts being the lasagna and manicotti dishes.  for dessert we tried the chocolate cake and cheesecake.  i'm not a chocolate person so i didn't try it but the cheesecake was devine.  we actually ended up with two pieces to match the size of the chocolate cake.  portions are huge enough for 5-6 really.  the bread was also really yummy with balsamic and oil.  i think this will be a regular stop on future vegas trips this was a great dining experience!"

            "i'm surprised this place has four stars, which i think is a little high if you're judging based on taste, but value for your money, this is definitely good value.\n\ni came here a couple nights ago with a very large group (about 14?). we showed up without notice, and they were still able to get a table for us in about half an hour or so. the table ordered off the family style menu where you can only pick two of each course, but can have as much of those courses as you want until you're ready for the next one. we ordered calamari, <mark>Caesar Salad</mark>, another type of salad (i think it was the maggiano's), tomato with mozarella, <mark><mark><mark>Chicken Parmesan</mark></mark></mark>, lasagna, spaghetti with marinara sauce, salmon, tiramisu, and cheesecake. the salads were decent - crisp, and tangy. the mozarella that came with the tomato was not very smooth and a little too 'pizza mozarella' tasting for me. the spaghetti with marinara sauce was my personal favorite, along with some of the other people at the table. it was light, and the spaghetti was cooked to just the right tenderness. the lasagna was very salty and the meat chunky in an unpleasant, crumbly way. it wasn't chewy, cheesy, and meshing with the lasagna layers. \n\nthe cheesecake was really delicious, came with fresh strawberries and whipped cream. mm!\n\nthe service was a little slow and sometimes unmindful of us, but it was fairly busy in the restaurant, so i can understand.\n\ni'd come here for a decent large group setting with fairly cheap eats, but i wouldn't come here for a date or a small intimate group meal.",

            "my husband and i love to take the family to maggiano's when we're in las vegas.  the food is amazing but be sure to bring your appetite!  it's family style so it's obviously huge but the portions here seem to be exceptionally large - even for family style. the stuffed mushroom appetizer, the <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> and the linguine/clams in red sauce are my recommendations. the service at this restaurant is amazing, as well. my drink was never  empty, they timed each course perfectly so that i was never with too little or too much food at my table and my leftovers were whisked away and returned in cute little brown packages before i had time to even notice they were gone.  great experience!\n\nthe restaurant is, also, on a great part of the strip so you can walk off all the food you just ate while taking in the sights.", 
            "i have been here many times, and each time i have been impressed with the restaurant and all it has to offer. the food here is fantastic - i highly recommend the flat breads or <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> for an appetizer. also, you are missing out if you do not order the four cheese ravioli. if you come to the restaurant with a large group, they have a great family style option. however, this option is only available for groups of four or over. do not waste your calories/money if your group is smaller than this - it is not worth it, and you will have to take food home.", 
            "we've always liked our normally pretty flawless dining experiences here.  but on this particular occasion, when of course i was introducing the restaurant to two friends, the wheels of service largely came off the tracks.  we had reserved a booth that overlooked picture windows facing strip hotels across the street, but it wasn't ready when we arrived.  we had to wait about 20 minutes for a booth to be cleared, which was no big deal.  but it established a pattern of service being at least two beats behind all night.\n\nfor starters, i ordered <mark>Calamari Fritt</mark> and crab & shrimp imperial, a special of the day.  i also ordered a cup of <mark>Tuscan Chicken Sausage</mark> & orzo soup and a side of <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> before my entree of linguine & clams.  bread arrived first, which was good and crusty.  but our iced teas and soft drinks were not brought forth until 10 minutes after the presentation of bread, evo, and butter.  and, one soft drink was missing.  so were two of four bread plates and a knife.  \n\nsoon afterward, the appetizers arrived.  unfortunately, so did both my soup and salad.  four items were plopped on the table at the same time--all of them mine.  although jammed up with food, i did my best to race through the appetizers before my soup got cold, and largely succeeded by taking half of each appetizer home.  the crab & shrimp imperial, consisting of crab-stuffed lobster with herb bread crumbs and lobster cream sauce over orzo pasta, was simply excellent.  it was also very filling.  the deep-fried calamari was uncharacteristically undercooked, but still fairly tasty--especially dipped in the lemon aioli that was prepared on request.  the accompanying marinara sauce was also good and mellow.  \n\nas before, the <mark>Tuscan Chicken Sausage</mark> & orzo soup did not disappoint.  the fennel-flavored soup packed an unusual but welcome taste of mild sausage, fresh tomatoes, celery, and white beans.  the side of <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> was a generous helping of cool and crisp romaine greens with focaccia croutons and grated parmesan cheese.  linguine & clams with invisible but tasty white clam sauce was a nice pasta dish that boasted both fresh and chopped clams.  but, unfortunately, only 7 fresh clams were present, which not only seemed meager but were far less than i had enjoyed on a previous occasion.  and, i bit down on a small piece of clam shell that was included in the mix.   \n\ngarlic bread focaccia was not very garlicky at all.  and, inexplicably, the cheesy fontina potatoes that my wife had ordered did not arrive at our table until 20 minutes beyond the third of three promises of \"2 minutes longer\" by our server, just after our packaged leftovers had been handed to us.  obviously, we didn't want additional starch any more at a point when we were about to leave the premises.  after an apology by our server that seemed sincere, the still steaming potatoes were packaged in a baking tin and presented to us again without charge.\n\nthe quality of ingredients and tastiness of what i ate were mostly sound as always.  and, kudos and an extra 1/2-star to restaurant management for calling to report that my missing kindle had been found on the floor of our booth, before i raced back to retrieve it right after midnight.  so, 3-1/2 stars on an off night.", 
            "extremely overrated and not impressive, at all. \n\ni went here for a business lunch and i arrived a bit early. the hostesses were very rude, rather than nicely say we're not open yet, they had an attitude that was like go the **** away. not a good start. \n\nwhen i finally get in i head to the back where yes, they have a screen setup and a sound system. but the projector is being leveled by paper towels and was amateurish at best. and the room we were in needed paint. seriously, when you take a look around the podium was chipped, the walls had chips, and i'm thinking for a place overlooking las vegas blvd that the experience was downgraded. it may have been classy a while back, but the management team needs to consider investing in a little bit of paint. \n\nthen we get to the wobbly tables, and the family style food that was brought out. family style might work in italy but this is america, and to me family style is a masquerade for a kitchen that is too slow or chokes at cranking out high volume high quality plates. in this case about the only thing good was the <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> as it's hard to muck up a <mark>Caesar Salad</mark>. but the rest of the food? truly unmemorable. if i was a tourist and i walked in expecting the place to live up even partially to it's \"little italy\" name i would have felt like i was the victim of a mafia shakedown. \n\nlong story short yelp may have this place ranked at 4 stars, but there's not enough wine in italy that could make me intoxicated enough to give it anything over 2. and that's only because i'm trying to be diplomatic about it. needless to say if it wasn't for business functions i won't be back. \n\n(note to staff: it takes money to make money. investing in simple, functional equipment and paint is a start. next, they're called spices. surely in the recipes that are used there's a line or two for various spices. your food was barely 1 notch above cafeteria food, no wait, i think a high school aged line cook at golden corral in amarillo texas could prepare better food than what i had.)\n\nyou should be ashamed to slap the word \"italy\" anywhere near your doors. i better stop typing before i end up clicking on just one star instead of two.", 
            "on my last outing to this venerable restaurant overlooking the strip on the edge of fashion show, maggiano's redeemed itself with a fine repast and picturesque view of encore.  our telephoned request for a booth with a strip view was honored despite the chagrined look of other hopefuls whom the maitre d' had to fend off to preserve our pre-reserved perch.  golden <mark>Calamari Fritt</mark> was on point and well made this time.  both rings and tentacles were lightly deep fried and excellent with great requested lemon aioli and mild marinara sauce.  bread and butter were very good, and, as always, a bowl of savory tuscan orzo & sausage soup sporting <mark>Gnocchi & Italian Sausage</mark>, fennel, white beans, fresh tomatoes, and plenty of orzo was excellent.  where this soup is concerned, to enjoy more stomach-warming, fluid rustic goodness i now always order a bowl rather than a mere cup.\n\na side <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> with grated parmesan and focaccia croutons in a creamy caesar dressing was excellent.  and, stuffed chicken pizzaiola with mozzarella, ricotta, tropheo pasta, pomodoro, red peppers, and pepperoncini was fine once i got to the middle of the chicken.  it was similar to chicken cordon bleu but zestier.  as usual, a side of fontina potatoes was creamy and delicious.  \n\nthis time we experienced excellent service as noel, our server, without any prodding, carefully spaced out our meal orders so that the various dishes would not come out of the kitchen on top of each other.  all went well except for me killing one of my favorite polo shirts with food stains from marinara sauce followed by splatters from the orzo & sausage soup.  after treating the stubborn marks with both zout and goo gone, after six washings they still remain.  i will not give up either the sauce or the soup.  but next time i am in their close proximity, regardless of appearances i will don a napkin to protect the front of whatever shirt i may be wearing at the time!\n\nfor a chain, this is truly a fine one!", 
            "another night at maggiano's, and another excellent dinner!  \n\nwe started with fine complimentary warm bread and butter in our reserved booth with a window view of the strip, and moved on to enjoy outstanding <mark>Calamari Fritt</mark>--excellent tentacles and first-rate golden rings, along with the cheerfully provided lemon aioli we had requested to accompany marinara sauce.\n\na bowl of orzo & sausage soup was also well prepared and excellent as a whole,  with sausage just tangy enough to make it intriguing.  although iced teas regularly arrived unbidden, i had to ask for butter twice.  it was quickly produced after the second request.\n\ncold crisp romaine leaves bathed in a thin application of a nice traditional caesar dressing, and small crunchy croutons dominated an excellent side <mark>Caesar Salad</mark>.  belatedly i asked for a single anchovy (semi-health consciousness at work!) and it was duly brought in its own ceramic cup to further enhance this course. \n\ngreat cheesy fontina potatoes represented a perfect blend of cooked potato slices and fontina cheese, and were more than enough to share with diane.  this time my entree of linguini & clams was superb, with a fine light white wine sauce, 9 clams still in the beds of their opened shells, and a generous amount of supplemental chopped clams.  meanwhile, diane did her best to attack 3 large medallions of veal parm with excellent yummy alfredo sauce accompanied by al dente rigatoni alfredo.  at meal's end she still had enough food left over for a very satisfying lunch two days later, and we were both too full to order dessert.\n\nonce again i unintentionally dropped and left items under our dining table.  this time when i pulled up on the driveway of my north las vegas home, i found that both a filled pill case and all of my house keys were missing from my coat pocket.  after a call to the restaurant and a check under our former table by restaurant management, all items were found.  so, for the second time in 13 months after dining here, i headed back to fashion show mall, and retrieved my dropped items from the check-in desk.  they had been found on the floor of the same booth where my kindle had been inadvertently abandoned on a previous visit.  so, in the future i either have to avoid this particular booth or take better care of my important personal possessions.  i think i will concentrate on the latter course of action!", 
            "disclaimer: the only time i come here is for large birthday gatherings featuring: (1) the extremely young; and (2) the extremely old.  i've never independently chosen to eat here.\n\ni will say they have their sh$t together when it comes to large private gatherings.  they're always well staffed and organized, unlike other spots in town (*cough* pj clarkes *cough*).  the private rooms are also spacious and feature large windows -- you're not in some afterthought back room.\n\nfurther, the portions they provide for groups are enormous.  even if there are 10 people at a table, it never runs out.  in fact, i usually get stuck with taking home leftovers.  just what i always wanted, 4 lbs of artichoke dip......\n\nbut, large portions aren't really a godsend if the food is just meh.  i've had the chicken & <mark>Baked Eggplant Parmesan</mark>, chicken piccata, penne with meat sauce, spagetti, <mark>Caesar Salad</mark>, <mark>Stuffed Mushrooms</mark>, calamari, profiteroles and...... none of it was memorable. \n\noverall, they serve up very basic italian food meant to please the masses......something easily achieved when the patrons are seven-years-old.....", 
            "i eat here about twice a year and love the place. it's above average italian for a fair price. i generally avoid carbs like the plague, but this place had bomb-diggity salads and wonderful protein options.\n\ni usually order the salmon, either grilled or on a <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> and it's never bad. no, it isn't the best fish you'll ever have but for the price you shouldn't be expecting such things.\n\ni am all about reasonable expectations with food. i'd give the food a 3.5 and the service a 4 in the out-of-five-stars department.", 
            "went here after shopping in the fashion show mall as me and my friend both wanted italian and i had come here before and knew that the food is pretty good. last time i came here i had a <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> which was good and is my favorite, but i decided to try the <mark>Maggiano's Salad</mark> this time. it was good, but it ended up being pretty filling, so i was almost too full to eat my spaghetti and <mark>Meatball</mark>, but luckily i took it home for later. i don't have anything negative to say about the food, and the wait time was 20 minutes which is average for dinner time in vegas. our server was decent...he could have refilled my water/soda more and he had to double check what we ordered even after asking us twice when he originally took our order. we sat by the window which was great for a view of the strip. i don't ever go out of my way to go to maggiano's but the food is good and so is the staff.", 
            "my what a difference a year makes...both in how i write yelp reviews and in my maggiano's experience. i was back at maggiano's for a private event and this time it was much better. yes, they serve the dishes family style. yes, you pay a slightly inflated price i attribute to the unofficial strip surcharge. you get past all that and you'll find some good food here. \n\non this occasion there was one item that had me going back for more: <mark>Crispy Zucchini Fritt</mark>. the zucchini is a diet killer. calorie counting? yeah, forget about that. just make sure you get yours before the rest of the table does. \n\nthe rest of the items i tried today were good, but there was nothing that warranted asking for a box to take it with me. the <mark>Fettuccine Alfredo</mark> was respectable, not the best i've ever had but it certainly was filling and i sneaked in a second small helping of it. the chicken piccata was actually disappointing. i masked my disappointment by having more <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> and where did that zucchini go again? \n\none note to the staff...the lemon cookies were too cold. but the apple crostada made me forget all about the cookies...\n\nas this was a business function, the maggiano's staff took great care of my needs and of everyone that i work with. all things considered 4 stars seems appropriate. \n\nalmost forgot to mention one more thing. the valet seems super slow here. if you're in a hurry to get somewhere else plan accordingly.", 
            "wow!  wow!  wow!\ngreat food!  great service!  great ambiance!\nwe were looking for a place to take our father for his 78th birthday dinner.  he loves italian.  though maggiano's is a chain, this location beats all of the other locations we have visited.  the waiter (nester) was terrific.  we decided to do the classic family style.  there was almost too much food for all of us.  each course and entree was delicious.  calamari was perfect.  steamed mussels were awesome.  <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> was bountiful and a good palate cleanser before the entrees.  peppercorn beef, salmon, chicken piccata, and linguine with red clam sauce were all perfect together.  but remember you have two desserts coming so make some room.  on this particular evening they had a gentlemen playing the violin.  he came over and serenaded our father with happy birthday.  bottom line father loved it all. thanks maggiano's!", 
            "it was new year's day, and another visit to maggiano's.  this dinner really started the year off right!  \n\nrustic bread was very good, and golden <mark>Calamari Fritt</mark> was again excellent alternately dipped in a specially requested lemon aioli, along with a mild marinara sauce.  a filling bowl of <mark>Tuscan Chicken Sausage</mark> & orzo soup was outstanding, and a small chopped <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> with a light and delicious creamy caesar dressing, big crunchy croutons, and parmesan splinters was nice and cool.\n\nalthough we had to ask for one round of water refills, and meat sauce was first mistakenly brought to diane's side of our booth, these minor lapses were quickly corrected, and otherwise service was excellent, as is usually the case here.  my entree of spaghetti & meatball in meat sauce was very fine indeed, with a large dense meatball, al dente spaghetti, and a mild sweet sauce.  for diane, roasted red potatoes served on request in lieu of pasta were simply prepared and excellent tasting.  i asked for a few mushrooms to be added to my meat sauce, and they were.  there was no charge levied for this or the aioli, although i would have gladly paid for these graciously given extras.\n\nonce again, five-star dining--on a holiday, when expectations are highest.  this time they were even exceeded!", 
            "this place has certainly changed alot, they use to have the best <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> and on our visit this past saturday, not so good, barely had any dressing on it.  service was also very poor, i understand they are very very busy but we waited a very long time to get our bread.  our waiter had not help from his busser.\n\ni don't like how you can no longer order small and large, food quality has definately gone down. :(", 
            "just another chain restaurant <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> and the food server at the table dropped the balsamic oil which splattered on my new shoes!", 
            "very delicious food.   i ordered the <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> and chicken franchese.  wife ordered the house salad and chicken alfredo light style.   both dishes were cooked perfectly and was tasty.  the complimentary bread was also fresh and good.", 
            "the portions are very generous, well worth the price.\n\nmy fianc\\u00e9 and i ordered the <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> and four\ncheese ravioli to share. the food was savory and appetizing!\n\ngreat restaurant for a date! food and service were up to par! we would definitely recommend as a wonderful place for large and tasty portions with awesome service!", 
            "another year later, and another new year's day meal at maggiano's--this time with friends.  food was as fine as usual, but this time there were just too many service errors to overlook.  i had to separately ask for more bread three times, and butter another three times before they were finally produced.  a table knife was taken away without substituting a replacement, and no serving spoon was provided for potatoes.  so one star was lost.\n\ncomplimentary italian bread had a nice doughy texture.  <mark>Calamari Fritt</mark> with marinara sauce and specially requested lemon aioli featured perfectly cooked golden tentacles and rings.  and mozzarella marinara consisted of four rectangles of slightly browned fried cheese.  \n\na side <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> with requested anchovies was crunchy and excellent.  and a bowl of <mark>Tuscan Chicken Sausage</mark> soup was very good except for hard included celery.  fontina potatoes were oozing with white cheese, and my entree of linguine & clams with white clam sauce, 12 littleneck clams in open shells, and several pieces of chopped clams was quite delicious.", 
            "great atmosphere. for appetizer we had the <mark>Crispy Zucchini Fritt</mark> which was my husbands favorite. we also ordered a side of <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> which needed more dressing so we asked for more. we also ordered the <mark>Creamy Tomato Basil</mark> soup, not the best soup ive had, it's too watery and not enough of the tomato taste more basil. for our entree we got the chicken marsala the lighter version and my husband said the chicken was dried. i had the alfredo fettuccine with chicken. my alfredo sauce was alright, not my favorite i think olive garden has better alfredo fettuccine. overall not bad for lunch but for italian food it was decent price and the waitress was really nice!", 
            "i came to maggiano's celebrate another yelper terri r birthday with family and friends. it was my first visit so never had much came to expectations. truthfully left with nothing exciting or inspiring comes to review. if there was one thing that stood out more then the food was the service was awesome. our waitresses really wish remember her name cause she deserve shout out in otherwise a-ok review. she was super friendly, cracking jokes with everyone keeping the atmosphere positive/festive, on top of our every needs, and personnel touches stood out for me. she had whole separate dessert just for birthday girl. just happen she was not at the table so took the dessert back and waited for birthday girl come back light the table right in front of her. great service.\n\nsince it was decent size party we had nine. terri was able to order family style meal. it reminded me bucca di beppo style. starters we had fried calamari, spinach and artichoke dip, and <mark>Caesar Salad</mark>. entrees not sure the filling believe ricotta raviolis with tomato sauce, spaghetti with tomato sauce, chicken marsala think, and lasagna. dessert chocolate cake, and one more forgot. by the time got to the dessert was stuffed. none of the dishes had wow factor at all. some of them felt like lack any depth of flavor. the tomato sauce in the spaghetti and am sure same base sauce use on the lasagna. bland not even sure if they put salt or pepper in it. the portion size got nothing to say except nice and generous. the pricing not all that bad for strip restaurant. the atmosphere is upscale but looking at the prices reasonable. it located in the fashion show mall so parking is ample and whether you valet or not easy access. \n\noverall so many more italian restaurant in vegas that are just as reasonable that food taste so much better. on this night it celebration beastmode terri r. not about the food but supporting family. happy birthday terri r.!!!!",

            "we went yesterday for my sisters birthday and we ordered from the lunch family style menu which is basically buffet style.  \n\nthe last time we were here were a few years ago and it seems like they changed up the menu because we were able to chose more dishes before and now we are limited to 1-2 items per category.  \n\nso you get to chose 1 salad, 1 appetizer, 2 pastas and 2 desserts for $23 per person (it use to be 2 for each i believe - my aunt was really disappointed).\n\nthey come out with the first plate and if you want more, you order 2nd or 3rd's according to how many people want extra.  (they do allow for you to take things home but they've become quite strict on finishing the first plate first).  \n\nthey do have gluten-free penne pasta so i was able to eat that.  \n\nwe ordered the <mark>Caesar Salad</mark>, calamari, clams and linguine, gluten free <mark>Taylor Street Baked Ziti</mark>, tiramisu, and the double fudge brownie.\n\nthe salad was a huge let down - the lettuce was super soggy.\nthe calamari was awesome, light batter and fried to perfection.\neveryone who had the clams said the first dish was too salty and the second dish that came out was way better.\nthe <mark>Taylor Street Baked Ziti</mark> had sausage in it and i usually love sausage but i didn't care for theres.  \nthe tiramisu was delicious and the brownie dish came with ice cream and strawberries.  my nephew and i had the strawberries while everyone else ate the super chocolatey brownie.\n\nit was nice to get together with family and eat a buffet without having to get up.  our server was nice but could have came around just a tab bit more.",

            "we decided to stop here and have lunch. boy am i glad that we did! maggiano's was delicious!! i really regret not taking pictures of our food but i was enjoying it so much that i was too busy stuffing my face and didn't think to pull out the camera. \n\ni'm a total soup girl, so after hearing the day's selection of soups, i decided on a cup of roasted mushroom soup. when it arrived my jaw dropped. i asked for a cup (or small ...whatever) and it arrived in a huge bowl!! the portions were huge! i even waited and double checked with our server that they didn't make a mistake and give me the bigger size bowl of soup and she said \"nope, that's the small one\". well, the soup was delicious. it was full of mushrooms in a cream base and was sooooo yummyyy!!!  my mom ordered the \"small\" <mark>Spinach Salad</mark> and that was delicious as well. never had roasted red peppers in a <mark>Spinach Salad</mark> and it surprisingly gave great flavor with the smoked bacon, crumbled gorgonzola, sweet onions and toasted pine nuts. we would have been just fine with our soup and salad but little did we know that the portions were going to be so huge!\n\nokay, entree time...we both went with sandwhiches. i had the jumbo lump crabcake sandwhich (via their menu on the website...\"crab cake on a brioche bun with arugula, tomato and crispy onion strings and mustard mayonnaise. served with parmesan chips\") and my mom had the seared salmon sandwhich (which is not listed on the menu online for some odd reason). those were the 2 best damn sandwhiches i've ever had!!!! omgggg!! sooo yummyyyy!!! i think it's funny that we were at an italian restaurant and didn't have pasta but i am so glad at our choices because the food was soooo delicious!\n\nwe were so stuffed from our soup and salad that we each only ate half of our sandwhiches and went back to our hotel room with our leftovers, happily! lol! we were very happy with our lunch from maggiano's and will be making it a regular stop on future visits to vegas.\n\nalthough i am in the bay and heard there's a maggiano's down in san jose, i rarely head down to the south bay so i doubt i'll be visiting that one. i highly suggest the location in las vegas!! \n\np.s. excellent service as well! oh yeah, and it was a lovely day so we opted to dine outside and it was very nice! the weather was perfect!",

            "for my mother-in-law's birthday last weekend, my husband planned a big surprise birthday party for her at maggiano's, which is an old favorite haunt of his.\n\nmaggiano's exterior is nothing spectacular considering they're stuck on the second floor of a mall, but once you step out of the elevator you're transported.  giant crystal chandeliers line the majestic hallways as you pass through the entryway and multiple private dining areas lined with dark wood.  the bar area is dark paneled, well-staffed, and tucked far in the busy back / main dining room.  it was packed when we arrived, but we found seats and ordered cocktails quite easily (though we heard there was a one-hour wait for tables for those without reservations).\n\nwhen our table for 10 was ready we headed over to a corner lot where our group gathered.  it wasn't particularly easy to navigate the space in which they'd placed our party, as they've crammed as many tables in the room as they can and we were situated up against six booths. however, the waiters were quite patient practicing a constant ballet / battle with us while we hugged one another and took photographs (or they just went around the other way).\n\nthe ambiance inside maggiano's was so dark, warm, and cozy that i was expecting more from the food.  the calamari that someone ordered as an appetizer was boring, bland, and uninspired.  the <mark>Spinach Salad</mark> i ordered was giant and tasty; however, i wished i'd stopped there.  unfortunately my huge vat of gnocci was equally bland and mediocre, and the bread on the tables was stale/hard.  it was so loud and busy in the restaurant (and i was drunk, which i'll get to in a minute) that i didn't even think to ask to try gt's entree (linguini and clams in red sauce) which he said was a good thing, because he hated it (and said that the food was much better a few years ago).\n\nthe adorable accordian player was a wonderful touch; he played some of our requests at one end of the table (although it was so loud in the restaurant that those on the other end couldn't hear).  throughout our meal i was shocked that i wasn't drinking my wine; every time i turned to look at my glass i could swear it looked as if i hadn't touched it.\n\nturns out that the stealth waiters were just constantly topping it off, which unfortunately resulted in a disequilibrium in the brain of yours truly, and my evening ended with me trying to get my mother in law to take us to a strip club and arguing with gt's uncle (who'd flown in from oahu for the occasion) about whether or not boys are hornier than girls.  bad, self, bad!  perhaps a waiter asking a gal every now and again if she'd like more wine would help a hypothetically drunk girl manage her evening in a slightly more classy manner.\n\nmy main gripe, however, was that gt and i had made cupcakes for dessert that spelled out \"oh, shit, she's 70!\" when all lined up properly.  but we brought them in our cupcake pan and the waiter brought them out in the same pan we'd brought them in (though we'd asked that they be put on a large plate).  as a result, they read \"ohsh   itsh  es70!\"  also, although the kind/patient waiter did light the candles for us, i got the impression that the staff just wrote us off at the end, or perhaps someone in the back was a little ticked off with us for bringing our own dessert.  regardless of the reason, i thought it very odd that they didn't bring us plates or forks with dessert - we had to hunch over the table and eat cupcakes over the tiny cupcake wrappers, carefully trying not to spill crumbs everywhere, which is not so easy to do when you're drunk on maggiono's bottomless glass of wine.", 
            "this place is awesome. i never miss a chance to dine there every time i am in vegas.\nour last dinner there was for new year's eve 2009. \ni had never ordered family style....be ready for pregnancy pants :-)\nthey serve an incredible amount of food...great food. the atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested.\n\nordering family is style is great when you're a large party (4 or more). the choice is limitless. \nfor fewer people, i would recommend a la carte.\nmy very favorite dish is the braised beef cannelloni....the beef and sauce are divine (it's better ordered a la carte than family style as it comes piping hot from the oven rather than on a large plate for everyone to share)\ntheir <mark>Spinach Salad</mark> and maggiano steak salad are both great.\ndon't miss the lasagna too and the apple crostada (so buttery).\n\nmaggiano, please open another location in the bay area closer to sf or in the east bay. san jose is too far!! what about walnut creek??", 
            "yum yum yum pretty much sums up my maggiano's experience. i went for a wedding reception which allowed me to sample many appetizers and entrees. i was not disappointed in any of them. the highlights were the breaded zucchini which was so crunchy and flavorful. there was a <mark>Spinach Salad</mark> that tasted like a party in my mouth, with bits of creamy cheese and pancetta bits. the entrees were equally gratifying, my faves were the salmon on a bed of spinach (cooked to absolute perfection) and the raviolis in a pesto cream sauce. the <mark><mark><mark>Chicken Parmesan</mark></mark></mark> was also a front runner, the chicken breasts were pounded so thin, yet still juicy and moist. \n\ni will definitely venture back to this gem in the mall!!!", 
            "i haven't gone to a maggiano's in a long time, first time in the vegas location too.  i made a reservation on the phone for 6:30pm, we got there by 6pm so i asked them if we could be seated.  they were still pretty empty at that time except at the bar where they had happy hour so they sat us in a nice booth seat.  our waitress wasn't particularly friendly but she did provide good service overall.  she didn't go over the specials either but no problem since i can read it myself.  \n\nordered the half order <mark>Spinach Salad</mark> (i always forget to ask them to leave the dressing on the side.  did it again this time too and they put way too much).  i remember it tasting a little better but it's probably because there was too much dressing.  i do love my grilled veggies and bacon in it though.  also ordered the calamari.  it was okay but i wish the marinara was spicy because it tasted kind of plain.  the warm bread with the olive oil and balsamic was yummy.  \n\ni only ordered two pastas for three people (waitress said all their dishes are now \"half order\" sized).  thank goodness i did too because the portions were still pretty big, plus i was already more than half-full from the appetizers and bread.  got the pesto chicken linguine and the seafood linguine.  the pesto chicken linguine had a ton of pesto, a little too much but when i reheated it the next day, it was so good.  the seafood linguine had a good amount of seafood and the tomato sauce kept it from getting heavy.  we took back over 2/3 of each of the pasta dishes because we were too full by then, even for dessert.  \n\nalthough the waitress wasn't talkative with us, she refilled our water, checked up on us, and gave me two little rolls of ciabatta breads when i asked her to box the few pieces left to go along with our pastas.  good service and she was well rewarded with a nice tip.", 
            "2 1/2 more like it. \nthey put lots of food on the plates, it's just that it's really nothing too special. the best of the lot we tried were the mussels, and the side <mark>Spinach Salad</mark> was okay as well. \nas for the veal picata, or the <mark>Jumbo Lump Crab Cakes</mark>...would  pass on them. \nwines in the limited selection are reasonably priced. \nalong with the large portions, prices are reasonable.. and that keeps the place packed with patrons... reservations are recommended.", 
            "we love maggiano's!!!  they have a great happy hour during the week and the bar area is relaxed and quiet.\n\nthere is an old man who looks like the six flags guy walking around playing violin and he is the coolest old little dude ever!!\n\nour favorites are the <mark>Stuffed Mushrooms</mark>, <mark>Spinach Salad</mark> (amazing dressing), and the tortelluca dish.\n\neverythig we have every eaten here is tasty.  you can't go wrong!!", 
            "we made reservations for maggiano's through yelp...and it was so fast and easy!  i would highly recommend making reservations through yelp, if it has the option.  i believe it was linked to foursquare?? not sure though.  \n\nwe took my mom out for a late mother's day dinner.  it wasn't crowded; which was great...though it got a bit crowded after 6pm.  while, we waited for my mom to arrive we sat at the bar.  my husband got a beer and he got a little surprise!  the glass in which the bartender poured the beer had a lipstick mark.  it was gross.  he told the bartender and looked at it in shock.  he gladly switched it out.  \n\nwe went with the family style \"classic\" option which includes 2 appetizers, salads and desserts & 4 entrees.  we got the calamari and zucchini for appetizer.  the ceasar and <mark>Spinach Salad</mark>.  the chicken parm, grilled salmon, spaghetti w/ <mark>Meatball</mark> and gnocchi w/ <mark>Gnocchi & Italian Sausage</mark>.  spumoni ice cream and tiramisu for dessert.  my favorite was the calamari, cesar salad, chicken parm and desserts...everything else is okay.  i didn't care to much for the salmon, though.  the portions were huge; had to take a lot of it home.  i didn't understand how they just put the ice cream in a warm bowl...by the time we got it, it was melted.  maybe they should put it in an ice bowl??  the waiter was nice and service was quick.  view is nice...oversees the wynn properties.  there is also a man that walks around in his violin to play music for you; which i believe you have to tip him. \n\nit's a good place to eat if there is a big group of you and craving italian food.", 
            "took a recent trip to vegas and after walking around starving me and my bf decided to try out maggiano's.  the ambiance is beautiful with rich furnishings and amazing views of the strip. bread is brought to the table with butter, but there is also olive oil on the table if you prefer to dip with that. we started with an appetizer of <mark>Tomato Caprese</mark> that was very good, next we shared the smaller version of the <mark>Spinach Salad</mark> that was amazing (bacon, pine nuts, super yummy dressing etc), and finally we split a plate of the <mark><mark><mark>Chicken Parmesan</mark></mark></mark> that was a large portion, so big in fact we ended up taking the rest to go in a box. in total, those 3 dishes 1 water and 1 coke was $37 which i thought was very reasonable. the sever was friendly, prompt and attentive. there was also a man with a guitar that would sing you a song at the time if you would like. overall i liked the mood of the restaurant, the romantic feel, delicious food and wonderful service. no complaints.",

            "i'm not the biggest fan of chain places mostly because the food lacks love and atmosphere seems fake.  but if there's a chain place that does it right, it would have to be maggiano's.  the food feels like its been prepared with care and the place is comfortable without being too commercial.  and their las vegas location is no exception.\n\nthe <mark>Maggiano's Salad</mark> and chocolate zuccotto cake are a must try.\n\nwhat was particularly interesting for this visit was the wine i had.   i usually find it difficult to smell what i'm suppose to smell in red wine: hints of strawberries, cherries, oak, vanilla, leather, sunshine, earth, wind, fire, etc, whatever.  not this time: i smelled the floral bouquet that was suppose to be in my red.  i was so shocked that i was practically snorting instead of drinking it.\nthe only reason i stopped was i heard our waiter ask, \"is everything okay, sir?\"  and as i looked up from my glass to answer, i saw the wife shaking her head with the \"what are you doing?\" look and the waiter slightly looming behind her with a smirk.\ni placed my glass down and responded, \"we're fine.  thank you.\"\ni should've responded with \"this wine may have gone sour.  could you please bring me something else?\"  but then he would have taken the only wine i could smell properly.",

            "i had never been here, but we were doing a combo bachelorette/birthday and this place was awesome.  one waitress was pissed because we were taking a lot of pictures and standing in her way!  oooohhhh i'm scared - she kept giving us mean looks but whatevs.  getting a group of females together to decided on 2 entrees, 2 salads, 2 apps is like filing your nails down a chalkboard.  someone has to take control!  i ordered a reisling and sat back to watch the fireworks show.  with large parties, the restaurant strongly \"suggests\" ok forces you to have family style, which is fine by me.  it actually works to your advantage because then you aren't squabling over the damn check.  of course we had one in our party that was a squabbler and a little bit of a pouty puss and was mad when she didn't get her own way.  well okayyyyyy.  so we finally decided on the <mark>Chopped Salad</mark> and spiniach salad and the bride is jewish so we asked for bacon/pork on the side, which was no problem.  the brushetti was awesome, the bread great and the spinach dip was ok, kinda like the frozen kind, just ok.  the ravioli was great!  the waiter even brought me and another girl a sample (large sample) of the pesto with chicken and it was my fav - we both wanted to order it for the entree, but because of the family style, we couldn't.  two people wanted to order off the ala carte menu, which they said was fine, as long as at least 6 wanted family style - that built in gratuity is a blessing because at the end of the meal, which was $22.50 per person, i ended up putting in $35 which covered my dinner, wine, tax and tip - couldn't beat it with a stick.  the food is 10000000000 times better than stinky old buca di pepto bismal!!  i highly recommend this place and i'm a picky eater.  love it", 
            "after a long hard day of shopping, i wandered upstairs to a restaurant called maggiano's.  i am so happy i did!  the restaurant itself sounded familiar but i knew i had never dined there before.  \n\nour server daniel was very attentive and personable, it was my first visit to las vegas so he pointed out many things that we could do in our spare time.  this restaurant had a great view.  you could see las vegas blvd, people shopping, or other diners just like me.  everyone around us seemed to be enjoying their experience at maggiano's and we were definitely enjoying ourselves!\n\nwe started our dining experience with the bruschetta.  it was definitely some of the best bruschetta i have ever had.  i make a pretty killer bruschetta and i was extremely impressed with shredded chunks of parmesan covering the top of the bruschetta.  splendido!!  the bruschetta was served on italian garlic bread that was topped with a tomato bruschetta relish made of tomatoes, balsamic vinegar, and roasted garlic.\n\nwe also ordered: the <mark>Chopped Salad</mark>, the <mark>Tuscan Chicken Sausage</mark> & orzo soup, and the <mark>Fettuccine Alfredo</mark>.  the <mark>Chopped Salad</mark> was very good.  i ordered it without green onions.  the salad ingredients were iceberg lettuce, tomatoes, blue cheese, avocado, and prosciutto tossed in a house dressing.  most of the items on the menu, they give you the option to order half or the full portion.  believe me when i say half is plenty when you want to eat more than just one thing.  i ordered the whole <mark>Chopped Salad</mark> and it was really big.  the <mark>Tuscan Chicken Sausage</mark> & orzo soup contained <mark>Gnocchi & Italian Sausage</mark>, fennel, white beans and tomatoes.  it was really tasty.  the <mark>Fettuccine Alfredo</mark> was delicious!  it was prepared with broccoli and garlic in a creamy alfredo sauce.  we only ordered the half portion of that as well and it was really large.\n\noverall my experience at maggiano's was great from start to finish.  our waters were never left empty, and our server was always around if we needed anything.  it seemed like all the servers we saw there were on top of their game waiting tables because you never saw a table that needed anything that they couldn't ask the server for.\n\nif you around the fashion show mall and you spot maggiano's on the 2nd floor, you should definitely wander up there and grab a bite to eat because i assure you it will be worth it.  i will definitely wander back into a maggiano's even if its not in las vegas.\n\ncheers and enjoy!", 
            "we went here for a business lunch. the atmosphere was really nice and bright and felt very appropriate for a power lunch. prices were pretty reasonable. \n\n*hot bread - highlight of the meal! \n*<mark>Chopped Salad</mark> - the \"crispy pancetta\" was bacon bits, ick, otherwise not a bad salad\n*for my entree i got the roasted chicken with \"crispy potatoes and green beans\". everything on the plate was soggy, tasteless and gross. i realize one shouldn't order roasted chicken at an italian place, hence why this place gets 3 stars instead of 2!!\n\noverall not a bad place to dine on the strip but with so many fabulous options in vegas it's hard for me to endorse this place. boring and corporate come to mind. for italian i prefer nora's.", 
            "went to maggiano's on sunday night for surprise engagement dinner. we were a group of 11 and only had to wait around 20 minutes. we were able to share a bottle of prosecco at the bar during the wait. we were told our table was ready and they led us into the wine cellar. i was so excited to be in a private room with dimmed lighting.\n\nfrom dinner we ordered the classic family style and were given the choices of two appetizers, salads, pastas, entrees and desserts. the food doesn't stop. the only hard part was agreeing on what to order. \n\nappetizers: <mark>Calamari Fritt</mark>\\u00e9 and bruschetta. \nsalads: ceasar and chopped.\npastas: <mark>Mom's Lasagna</mark> and chicken & truffle tortellacci \nentrees: chicken saltimbocca and <mark>Baked Eggplant Parmesan</mark>\ndesserts: creme brulee and chocolate zuccotto cake \n\nmy favorites were the <mark>Chopped Salad</mark>, love blue cheese! chicken & truffle tortellacci was the most interesting flavors and the <mark>Baked Eggplant Parmesan</mark> had the perfect breaded textured and eggplant was cooked just right. creme brulee was fantastic and huge, but by that point we were so full. i would also recommend the chianti castello di querceto. went really well with the <mark>Mom's Lasagna</mark>.\n\nryan was our server and he was fantastic. very attentive and helpful. they even brought in two older men who played guitar and violin and had us do our first dance. the night was great. thank you maggiano's and ryan!", 
            "breaking news: notorious italian cuisine hater, archie g., had italian food for dinner and didn't immediately want to vomit afterwards.\n\non a business trip in las vegas, my speaking manager (who does not speak spanish) asked me to help him take out our large limited our latin american distributors (who don't speak english) for dinner. somehow, i was put in charge of finding a restaurant suitable for all four of us. normally, i shy away from huge responsibility at work. i avoid the break room so i don't have to ever have to take out the trash. that's just how lazy i am.\n\nanyway, with this language challenged arrangement, i knew it was going to be up to me (and my two years of spanish in college) to keep the dinner engaging, organized, and running smoothly. luckily for me, maggiano's helped out with the experience.\n\nthe two chilean clients communicated to me that they loved steak and italian food. with the help of my yelp blackberry application, i suggested benihana or maggiano's (and tried not show sadness in my eyes). ironically, their eyes lit up when they heard maggiano's and the date was set.\n\nfor starters, the staff here is a superb. the hostess helped me make a reservation for a couple hours later, so i was able to give the rest of the dinner participants time to get ready, as i ran off and went shopping for a little gift for la novia at the nearby mall. our server was awesome. how lucky was i that the server was chilean? he helped out immensely making our chilean clients feel comfortable, recommending dishes and beers, and making on occasional joke or two. great guy. great server. give that guy a raise.\n\nas for the food, it wasn't terrible. we had the \"all you can eat family style\" meal, which included two salads, two appetizers, four main courses, and two desserts to share (and share and share) until we were ready to be wheeled out of the restaurant.\n\nappetizers: we had the \"<mark>Calamari Fritt</mark>\" and \"<mark>Stuffed Mushrooms</mark>.\" the fried calamari was average and the dipping sauce was essentially ragu. i liked the <mark>Stuffed Mushrooms</mark> and so did the rest of the group as had another round of it. however, i did wonder why they were not given an italian name on the menu. maybe the guy who wrote the menu only took 2 years of italian in college?\n\nsalads: the \"<mark>Chopped Salad</mark>\" was a eally good salad. there is no way it can be good for you.  we also had the \"<mark>Italian Tossed Salad</mark>\" and it was wonderful. who doesn't love a good <mark>Italian Tossed Salad</mark> by an italian?\n\nmain courses: we ordered 4 different main courses. the \"spaghetti, meatball\" and i could have made it better at home. the \"veal ravioli\" was pretty good. it wasn't as heavy as i had imagined. the \"gnocchi, tomato vodka sauce\" was my contribution to the group. the gnocchi just melted in your mouth. it was the best dish all night and we had another round of it. the \"the \"salmon, lemon & herb\" smelled pretty bad. i was afraid to get that on my lips or fingers. i didn't want la novia to pick me up from the airport and think i was having an affair or something.\n\ndesserts: the cr\\u00e8me brulee was pretty good. we had three rounds of this. i love burnt cream. we had the \"n.y. style cheesecake\" and it well, it was just plain ol' cheesecake. i think the \"n.y.\" stood for \"not your.\" as in, \"not your style cheesecake.\"\n\noverall, the food was up and down and mostly mediocre. it was factory style italian food that lacked much distinctive flavor. essentially, it was a pricier version of \"olive garbage\" or \"bucket of crappo.\"\n\nthis was no more than 2 to 2.5 star food. but the ambiance and staff helped make this a very successful business dinner. so successful, we went out on the town for an adventure that included gambling, karaoke, and general las vegas debauchery.\n\nand well, i will award another star for that.", 
            "just got back from a wedding in vegas where the reception was held at maggiano's. the atmosphere inside is elegant, but comfortable. the private room was perfect in size with a large bar at the front and a balcony overlooking the strip. the service during the reception was stellar. i told our bartender/server about my gluten allergy and she was immediately able to identify substitutions and alternate courses for me that would meet my needs. she knew exactly what to do and made me feel at ease right away. i had an awesome <mark>Chopped Salad</mark> to start with that made the other non-gluten free people around me jealous. then i enjoyed marsala mushroom and chicken gluten free pasta. oh my god, it was out of this world. i need to go to the maggiano's and tampa asap to have this again. finally for dessert, i had the creme brulee, again making everyone around me jealous. the meal was unbelievable!! kudos to the staff and chef at maggiano's for making the whole night perfect both for guests and for the bride and groom. i have not visited an italian restaurant since i learned of my allergy but now i absolutely have to go back to maggiano's.  if you are in vegas, definitely make this a dinner spot at least one night of your stay.", 
            "this was a great place to eat on the strip.  we didn't have reservations, but we took seats in the bar area. other reviews suggested reservations, so if you have a large group or need to make a show, make reservations.  i had the <mark>Creamy Tomato Basil</mark> soup and <mark>Chopped Salad</mark>. both were wonderful.  my husband had the spaghetti and <mark>Meatball</mark>. my children had the cheese ravioli's and the penne pasta. they also offer family style meals if you prefer that.  the waitress was very friendly and service was great.  i would recommend this to anyone going to vegas. so much of the food we ate was overpriced and mediocre. this was reasonably priced and delicious.", 
            "i have been to maggianos about 3 different times but this last time warrants some shout outs. i graduated and wanted a place to go for my group of 10 friends and family. i found out they also have a happy hour that's offered in the restaurant so i made the reservation. \n\nwe were seated right away and our drink orders were taken almost immediately. the group decided to participate in the family style dinner. we had calamari, bruschetta, <mark>Chopped Salad</mark>, chicken parm, <mark>Fettuccine Alfredo</mark>, parmesan crusted tilapia, tiramisu and pound cake. woooo! \n\nthe best part of our meal was the very attentive and funny jacob. he always offered us more food but everything was just enough for our group. he kept the drinks a flowing too and made sure this girl was happy, happy on her graduation day.", 
            "we dined here last night with a party of 10.  ordered the family style dinner and were very impressed.  brandon took very good care of us the whole night.  we were never rushed and the food just keep coming.  the <mark>Chopped Salad</mark> was great along with the <mark>Stuffed Mushrooms</mark>.   dinner was <mark>Baked Eggplant Parmesan</mark>, salmon, chicken picata and sausage with gnocchi which all were excellent.  one of our diners had some dietary issues and they were very attentive to her.  dessert was amazing my favorite being the apple pie.  everyone in our party was very impressed!", 
            "i cannot rave about this place enough. i only ever get to a maggiano's on vacations. this time did not disappoint. we went with a party of 6 and had the family style experience. <mark>Chopped Salad</mark>, <mark>Jumbo Lump Crab Cakes</mark>, and gnocchi with sausage to name a few dishes. everything was perfect. wait staff was pleasant. a violinist came to our table and even took some unusual requests. great experience. a must try!", 
            "when it comes to italian this place is my favorite in vegas ! great place to take a date or your whole family, please be smart and make reservations because with quality food like this there will be many people there. lets talk about some of my favorite things to order.\n\nright from the start the warm bread basket is fantastic please enjoy the top notch virgin olive oil and the best balsamic vinegar i have ever had! \nsome of my favorite appetizer are bruschetta, a simple but very tasty plate, the <mark>Chopped Salad</mark> or any of their salads are great and large enough to share and though i personally am not a fan of calamari my grandma and fathers side of the family who are 100% sicilian i may add rave about it and order it every time we go! \nas for main course you can't go wrong with any of their pasta dishes which i can almost guarantee you will have some left over to take home! my favorite, though it is another simple classic dish, is the spaghetti and <mark>Meatball</mark> i absolutely love it! the chicken parm is fantastic as well! in all honesty their are more great dishes here than i can name in this review!\nnow for desert, if you were able to save room go for it or you can be like me and get a piece of tripple layer chocolate cake to go, it is extremely rich and very well made the cheesecake is very good as well! \n\ni strongly reccomend this restaurant and as i said in the beggining it is one of the better places to take a date especially if you want to impress, once again please make reservations for less wait time but if there is a little wait they have a great little bar area you can grab a few cocktails relax and socialize! also as i said dont limit this place to only dates its great for the whole family with large portions attentive wait staff and a lot of class ! 5 stars and truley a gem! \nenjoy :)", 
            "amazing italian food, incredible service and a great atmosphere! besides, who doesn't love to hear frank sinatra in the background?\n\nwe love this place! we usually just sit in the bar area and have drinks and appetizers and whatever we order is always full of flavor, a hearty serving and tasty! a few things i would recommend, the <mark>Maggiano's Salad</mark> with a delicious house dressing and crispy prosciutto, the mussles with red sauce that is spicy and sweet and makes you want to pick up the bowl and drink it! the flatbreads, bruschetta, sausage and peppers, stuffed shells and <mark>Chopped Salad</mark> are also top picks. \n\neven if you are feeling like you need to unbutton your pants as the server asks you if you would like dessert, say yes!! we ordered the mini sampler and every little delectable sugary bite of creme brulee, apple crostada, chocolate zuccotto bites, tiramisu and cheesecake were perfect. \n\nwe will definitely be back. salute!", 
            "went in last night after some friends getting married.  i am giving it 3 stars because the atmosphere is great and our server was wonderful. i have been here a few times and the food was always good. last night it was lacking something. the presentation was boring it was as if it was just thrown on the plate little messy. apps were good <mark>Chopped Salad</mark> was delish.  i would say that was my fav of all the dishes we had.  seems as if quality has gone downhill :(",

            "my buddies and i decided to eat here while all of us suffered from hangovers.  the delicious food here will restore your apetite from whatever came back out from the previous night.  the family style is a great way to enjoy the meal.  they provide a lot of food for their prices.\n\nwe started with the potato soup which relly jump started my apetite.  it's rich, creamy, and flavorful.  next up was the beef braciole.  this dish was quite interesting.  the texture was weird yet it was edible (may have been my hangover dulling my senses).  i can't quite remember the name of the next dish, but it was a spicy spaghetti and meat balls, i believe.  the spiciness brought back all my senses and pretty much kicked me out of my intoxicated state.  you can never go wrong with spaghetti and <mark>Meatball</mark>.  we also had the rigatoni \"d\".  the chicken was tender and the protein gave me energy for more partying.  \n\nthey gave us enough food to take back to the hotel and have for dinner.  if you love italian food and pastas, this place would be a place to stop by.",

            "as i was shopping at fashion show mall i noticed this italian restaurant and made a mental note to check it out on yelp later for a possible dinner option.\n\naccording to yelp this place was worth trying. i used the open table feature to make a reservation (not knowing if it was really needed or not, but i figured why not). i'm glad i did. when we made it in to the restaurant it was packed and there was a wait. we were seated immediately. \n\nwe were seated in a comfortable booth seat, and served water immediately and given some explanation of the menu. this place had a good variety of italian food from pastas, to chicken, beef and seafood selections. i liked that they had a family style option as well. at first glance i would say this place looks pricey specially since your entr\\u00e9e comes with just your entr\\u00e9e no salad or soup like olive garden. \n\nwe ordered a side salad to share that was $4.95 but it was the perfect size for two specially since we were stuffing our faces with the yummy french bread served with olive oil and vinegar (oh so yummy, and dangerous!). \n\nour plates took over 30 minutes to arrive, if it was not for the bread and salad i would have been more upset. \n\ni ordered <mark>Mom's Lasagna</mark> made with <mark>Meatball</mark> and sausage with your choice of marinara or meat sauce. i choose marinara since so much meat came with the dish already. my plate arrived and what do you know, it probably could have served four people, fairly large portions. i ate all of it, in phases but i ate it all. it was exquisite. perfect layering, the lasagna stayed together (i hate when you cut into lasagna and the layers fall apart). \n\nmy favorite part was being serenaded by a duo (violin and guitar) to one of my wedding songs (it's impossible). if it weren't for the wynn in the background i could almost say i was in italy.\n\ni don't have any complaints about this place. our total bill came to $37.50: two entrees, one side salad and one beverage. we came on a monday night and it was busy so definitely try and make reservations if you can.", 
            "it's a national chain, so if you've been to one you've been to them all. but, the good thing about higher-end chain restaurants is that they're consistent. and, in the case of maggiano's, they're consistently good, for the most part, and a good value.\n\nmy wife had a gift card to their family of restaurants, which included chili's and macaroni grill. naturally, we chose the best of the lot -- maggiano's. located in fashion show mall, it's a pain to find the entrance. walking through the mall, you have to actually walk outside of the mall towards the strip and head to the second level via the outdoor escalators to find the main entrance.\n\nthis was a family outing for us -- our three year old son in tow -- so we were happy to be seated at a booth. they've got a kid's menu with the usual stuff (pizza, chicken fingers, mac-n-cheese, etc). for $5.95 kids get an entree, beverage, and a dessert (lemon cookies or vanilla ice cream). my kid opted for the pizza. it's a long, rectangular, crispy cheese flatbread pizza cut into triangles. tasty and large enough for two kids to share.\n\nthe lasagna was the best item of the night. a huge brick shape filled with crumbled <mark>Meatball</mark> and <mark>Gnocchi & Italian Sausage</mark> and covered in meat sauce. the gnocchi also came in a large portion, good enough for two people. while it was a little too dense, it was a passable version of the dish that came with spicy <mark>Gnocchi & Italian Sausage</mark> and a creamy (oversauced) vodka sauce.\n\nthey have small dessert options for $2.95. the chocolate cake was decent. a little too cold and firm, but it hit the spot. we also opted for the lemoncello pie ($7) -- essentially a circular key lime pie with cherries garnishing the plate and topped with whipped cream and almond slivers.\n\nwhile not the best italian food in the city, maggiano's does make for a good family restaurant at a decent price, considering its location.\n\n3.5 stars", 
            "i haven't been to maggiano's for about 5 years.  but it still has the same solid food.  \n\n*this location is inside the fashion show mall*\n*they only serve the dinner menu...no lunch specials*\n\nwe came for a light lunch at the bar at 1pm.  maggiano's actually fit the bill because we shared the following: a italian toss side salad and an order of spaghetti <mark>Meatball</mark>.  hubby had beer on draft which came in a tall (but skinnier than usual) glass.\n\nitalian toss side salad - we opted for the side salad portion simply because we didn't\n      want leftovers.  romaine lettuce, arugula, red onions, tomatoes, croutons,\n      peppercinis with a light viniagrette dressing\n\nspaghetti <mark>Meatball</mark> - rather meatball, no s.  it was a big meatball though. \n      spaghetti was a smaller portion than expected.  however, it was perfect for our\n      purposes.  i love to add red pepper flakes in my pasta.\n\nthe lady working the bar area did a great job taking orders, serving, etc.", 
            "i've heard about maggiano's for awhile and finally got the chance to eat at one of their restaurants when i was in vegas for business.  since there were 7 of us, we decided to order family style...  $31 a head and we choose two appetizers, two salads, two pastas, two entrees, and two desserts, all you can eat!\n\nwe ordered the calamari and mussels, chopped and <mark>Italian Tossed Salad</mark>, spaghetti and <mark>Meatball</mark> and linguine with clams (white sauce) the chicken marsala and tilapia, and the tiramisu and s'mores special dessert.  calamari was great, but i was a little disappointed in the mussels.  too many white beans in the mix for me.  the salads were good.  linguine was good and the <mark>Meatball</mark> on the spaghetti were huge! the tilapia wasn't too fishy and was nice and moist and we loved the chicken marsala.  both desserts were great as well.\n\nbig points for our waiter, noel, as well.  he was very helpful, professional, and attentive through our stay.  he encouraged us to eat more and even gave us many containers to take home our leftovers in.  the spaghetti and chicken marsala were still great the next day, as well as the desserts!", 
            "we made reservations for maggiano's through yelp...and it was so fast and easy!  i would highly recommend making reservations through yelp, if it has the option.  i believe it was linked to foursquare?? not sure though.  \n\nwe took my mom out for a late mother's day dinner.  it wasn't crowded; which was great...though it got a bit crowded after 6pm.  while, we waited for my mom to arrive we sat at the bar.  my husband got a beer and he got a little surprise!  the glass in which the bartender poured the beer had a lipstick mark.  it was gross.  he told the bartender and looked at it in shock.  he gladly switched it out.  \n\nwe went with the family style \"classic\" option which includes 2 appetizers, salads and desserts & 4 entrees.  we got the calamari and zucchini for appetizer.  the ceasar and <mark>Spinach Salad</mark>.  the chicken parm, grilled salmon, spaghetti w/ <mark>Meatball</mark> and gnocchi w/ <mark>Gnocchi & Italian Sausage</mark>.  spumoni ice cream and tiramisu for dessert.  my favorite was the calamari, cesar salad, chicken parm and desserts...everything else is okay.  i didn't care to much for the salmon, though.  the portions were huge; had to take a lot of it home.  i didn't understand how they just put the ice cream in a warm bowl...by the time we got it, it was melted.  maybe they should put it in an ice bowl??  the waiter was nice and service was quick.  view is nice...oversees the wynn properties.  there is also a man that walks around in his violin to play music for you; which i believe you have to tip him. \n\nit's a good place to eat if there is a big group of you and craving italian food.", 
            "i was impressed with this italian restaurant located in fashion show mall. i was not aware this was a chain restaurant until my wife told me. i wish they had one in san diego, but the closest one to us is in orange county at the south coast plaza. i ordered the four cheese ravioli which came with two sauces, basil pesto and marinara, evenly distributed over the dish. the amount of ravioli was bountiful. i was barely able to finish it and when i did i was really full. my wife had the spaghetti with <mark>Meatball</mark> which she had no problem finishing.  we tried to eat here again before we left but it was too busy. i think there was an hour wait. and this was on a sunday night. this is a good sign the restaurant is doing something right since there are plenty of choices at the mall.  the service was a bit slow but the waiter kept us informed on when our meals would be ready. no big deal, we were not in a rush. even though i am not a big fan of chain restaurants, this one is worth a try.", 
            "i am a huge maggianos fan at the bellevue washington location and was excited to see one of my favorite places on the strip. \n\nwe get to the restaurant at 5ish. with a party of 5. we are told about 1-1.5 hour wait. okay no problem after looking around and seeing countless open tables we ask why cant we sit at one of the patio tables, they responded with they are reserved but we don't know when they are showing up.. \n\nwe finally take a seat after an hour wait for the table that was previously reserved but the group never showed up.. i was over it and excited and very hungry. \n\nwe ordered the first all you can eat family deal the food was amazing as always. \n\nthe service was slow, couldn't answer simple menu questions.. do you <mark>Meatball</mark> have pork in them? (they don't they are 100% beef)\n\nup to this point was was frustrated that everything seemed disorganized, sloppy and chaotic. it took 20 minutes to get bread on the table.\n\n------the reason for 1 star------\n\nwe were given a table outside on the patio and i was in the back corner of the table. as i was sitting at the table i scooted my chair over and back about 5\" it turns out there was a hole about 2-3\" deep that used to have a hand rail post sticking out of it but was removed to make more room.. i fell back in my chair and some how caught myself mid fall to avoid slamming my head into the cement wall behind me. i pop up and my dad said the dishwasher behind me had a look like i almost died and the server next to me said when i was in the hole pulling my chair back out. \"oh yeah there is a hole there\" wtf kind of observation is that. if you know about a preexisting hazard fix it!!!\n\nlong story short i pulled something my back and was instantly hurting. we contacted the manager who seemed on top of offered to take me to the hospital and call him if i had any problems.  i wasn't about to have my last night in vegas be ruined by that. for my pain and all this we got 25% taken off the bill. and i left hurting and in pain.\n\n\ni think this was a weak compensation for the pain the and hazard, have my mom or dad been sitting here they physically couldn't have caught there balance as fast and would have been seriously hurt.", 
            "went here after shopping in the fashion show mall as me and my friend both wanted italian and i had come here before and knew that the food is pretty good. last time i came here i had a <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> which was good and is my favorite, but i decided to try the <mark>Maggiano's Salad</mark> this time. it was good, but it ended up being pretty filling, so i was almost too full to eat my spaghetti and <mark>Meatball</mark>, but luckily i took it home for later. i don't have anything negative to say about the food, and the wait time was 20 minutes which is average for dinner time in vegas. our server was decent...he could have refilled my water/soda more and he had to double check what we ordered even after asking us twice when he originally took our order. we sat by the window which was great for a view of the strip. i don't ever go out of my way to go to maggiano's but the food is good and so is the staff.", 
            "this was a great place to eat on the strip.  we didn't have reservations, but we took seats in the bar area. other reviews suggested reservations, so if you have a large group or need to make a show, make reservations.  i had the <mark>Creamy Tomato Basil</mark> soup and <mark>Chopped Salad</mark>. both were wonderful.  my husband had the spaghetti and <mark>Meatball</mark>. my children had the cheese ravioli's and the penne pasta. they also offer family style meals if you prefer that.  the waitress was very friendly and service was great.  i would recommend this to anyone going to vegas. so much of the food we ate was overpriced and mediocre. this was reasonably priced and delicious.", 
            "as far as chain restaurants go, this is one of my favorites. this particular location is awesome too, and i suspect because of it's primo las vegas strip location, they are all trained to wow you with their service.\n\ni took the wife and kid here, and i was almost ashamed to do so because of the white cloth tables. this location seemed just a tad upper class, but alas we were hungry wolfpack. and i spotted a smattering of kids here so i didn't feel as bad later.\n\nordered the bruschetta, <mark>Shrimp Scampi</mark>, and classic spaghetti <mark>Meatball</mark>. all dishes were excellent,  esp the scampi. no complaints here. the bruschetta was super tasty, the tomatoes and olive oil made me feel like i was in tuscany. haha. too much? yeah.\n\nservice was amazing. i didn't get the guys name but it was perfect. friendly, but not fake, attentive, but not pyscho. deserving of his 25% tip...only in vegas right?\n\nanyway, if you got an urge for italian but don't want snotty service at a michelen joint, come here.", 
            "this place was great. my dad loves a good spaghetti and <mark>Meatball</mark>, it's his go to favorite meal.  and me myself, i love <mark><mark><mark>Chicken Parmesan</mark></mark></mark>. we went here  when we were visiting my dad in the fall. we had a great, amazing view of the strip, and it was right as the sun going down... perfect.\n\nwe all had great food, and great service. i know it's a chain but it was still good to enjoy it and the environment was great.\n\nhopefully, next trip out to vegas to visit me dad, we can stop again.", 
            "i have always been a fan of maggiano's. i first went to one of their establishments over 10 years ago in chicago and have gone to that one probably ten times since. when they opened one in las vegas i was happy to go there as well and have frequented it many times since then. \n\nmaggiano's is one of those rare restaurants that overfeeds you meaning they serve huge servings which is very hard to usually finish unless you're super hungry. \n\non our most recent visit we got spaghetti and <mark>Meatball</mark>, <mark>Shrimp Scampi</mark>, chicken piccata, sauteed spinach, and mashed potatoes. as usual my family had a hard time devouring all the food. my niece was overwhelmed by the huge serving of shrip scampi as was my son with the spaghetti. i was just able to finish off my dish of chicken piccata. \n\nneedless to say that we are fans of maggiano's and it is always on our list of restaurants to visit when in vegas.", 
            "when it comes to italian this place is my favorite in vegas ! great place to take a date or your whole family, please be smart and make reservations because with quality food like this there will be many people there. lets talk about some of my favorite things to order.\n\nright from the start the warm bread basket is fantastic please enjoy the top notch virgin olive oil and the best balsamic vinegar i have ever had! \nsome of my favorite appetizer are bruschetta, a simple but very tasty plate, the <mark>Chopped Salad</mark> or any of their salads are great and large enough to share and though i personally am not a fan of calamari my grandma and fathers side of the family who are 100% sicilian i may add rave about it and order it every time we go! \nas for main course you can't go wrong with any of their pasta dishes which i can almost guarantee you will have some left over to take home! my favorite, though it is another simple classic dish, is the spaghetti and <mark>Meatball</mark> i absolutely love it! the chicken parm is fantastic as well! in all honesty their are more great dishes here than i can name in this review!\nnow for desert, if you were able to save room go for it or you can be like me and get a piece of tripple layer chocolate cake to go, it is extremely rich and very well made the cheesecake is very good as well! \n\ni strongly reccomend this restaurant and as i said in the beggining it is one of the better places to take a date especially if you want to impress, once again please make reservations for less wait time but if there is a little wait they have a great little bar area you can grab a few cocktails relax and socialize! also as i said dont limit this place to only dates its great for the whole family with large portions attentive wait staff and a lot of class ! 5 stars and truley a gem! \nenjoy :)", 
            "this place was absolutely amazing! out waiters name was dave. he treated us so well. answered all of our questions and gave us amazing recommendations. we ate the stuffed shells, spaghetti and <mark>Meatball</mark>, and lasagna and it was spectacular! the food came out so fast, and we were starving. i will definitely be back to this place very soon!!", 
            "my friends & i had a very pleasant dining experience here when they rented out one of the private rooms at maggiano's as the lunch reception for their 10-year wedding vow renewal. we had 3 tables that seated about 10-12 people. there was plenty of room for a display table as well. and there was also an adjacent balcony with a view of the strip & encore. they had a specially tailored menu with their names on it as well as at the door upon entering the room (we had to correct them on the spelling when we arrived & they corrected it before the families arrived). overall the service and the experience was a positive one. i think it's safe to say the guests & celebrants enjoyed their time at maggiano's. i'd advise you to valet outside because the elevator by valet takes you right up to restaurant. my friend that lives in town gave me that nugget of information. so convenient...\n\nnow on to the menu: first course was <mark>Stuffed Mushrooms</mark>, calamari & <mark>Italian Tossed Salad</mark>. the <mark>Stuffed Mushrooms</mark> were good. they were big mushrooms and it was stuffed with spinach and bread crumbs. they were served in a white wine sauce. you cant go wrong with calamari and their version didn't disappoint. fresh tasting pieces of breaded squid accompanied with marinara sauce for dipping. just squeeze some lemon over the calamari and you're golden. the <mark>Italian Tossed Salad</mark> was surprisingly delicious. salad had arugula, lettuce, pepperoncinis & croutons in italian dressing. good appetizers. i enjoyed every single one of them. \n\nsecond course consisted of meat lasagna, rustic chicken & shrimp and chicken marsala. i loved the meat lasagna. but really, what's not to love? it's lasagna! and it was classically delicious. they don't call it \"mom's meat lasagna with meat sauce\" for nothing. crumbled <mark>Meatball</mark> & sausage with ricotta cheese. boom! i didnt have the rustic chicken & shrimp but my friend's seemed to like it. the chicken marsala was so very good. white meat chicken that was so moist and tasty. it was the perfect chicken dish. i loved it the most... and that's saying a lot given that lasagna was on the menu. order it. trust me.\n\nfor dessert, we had 2 offerings. chocolate zucotto cake & nonna's toasted pound cake. all i had was the toasted pound cake & that's all i needed. it was so damn good. crispy edges on the pound cake topped with a scoop of vanilla bean ice cream, slivers of chocolate and served along side caramelized bananas. game over. i dont have to tell you how good it was. you already know. \n\nyou're welcome...", 
            "my initial thought was that this feels like a chain restaurant (without realizing it was).  the young low quality waitstaff, the generic menu and the robotic operationally efficient way the place was run all made me think that.\n\nthe couple in front of us requested and was granted a booth.  we then ask for a booth and are told there are no booths available.  we look around and there are tons of booths available both on the outskirts of the floor layout and right in the middle.  we ask if those were reserved and the host says no, there is only one table open and no booths open and he says that is due to lack of waitstaff.  wtf.  within minutes of us sitting at a table the next couple is sat at a booth...wtf?!?  this pisses off my buddy who says something negative and storms off to talk to the manager.  a random waitress hears this and ask if there is a problem.  i tell her the issue and her reply is essentially \"we have lots of booths available for you to sit\". long story short the manager moves us to the booth we figured they would seat us at in the first place.\n\nour waiter at the first table was terrible.  i'd expect him at an applebees in some podunk town of 15,000 people..not a supposed nice restaurant on the strip.  his unkept hair and facial hair that more closely resembled pubic hair made him look like he was homeless.  he talked like a \"surfer duuuude.\"  this isn't taco bell buddy.  he also didn't seem to know what he was doing.  he would just ask if we know what we want and then would disappear for a long time.  he brought my water without the lemons i requested.  when he asked if we needed anything else i said lemons and he's like \"sure dude\"seemingly oblivious to the fact that he had previously told us he would bring some.\n\nour waiter at our 2nd table was much more experienced.  he gave us spiels about the menu items.  he was also far more attentive.  one funny thing i heard him say quite loudly to the other waiter that most would have taken offense to was that the first waiter \"won the lottery\" which was an obvious reference to us not spending much money.  it should be noted that we ordered drinks/desert later which he didn't realize when he made the comment.\n\nto me the menu was boring and bland.  it should be noted i don't eat seafood.  there was nothing that jumped out at me and told me it wanted me to eat it so i just made the oh so generic order of spaghetti and <mark>Meatball</mark> with meat sauce.  it was tasty.  don't expect anything special from it.  free bread before the meal always gets my approval and it was good.  i also ordered the tiramisu which was awesome.  definitely recommend that.\n\nmy buddy was told each waiter only has 4 tables which i can't fathom especially with as poor service as the original waiter delivered.  i assumed they were having service issues because youtube personality \"the trooper\" recently quit working there.  the host was clueless and didn't even know who the trooper was.  whattttuuuup trooper, it's the yelp reviewer letting you know that maggianos has already gone downhill since you left.", 
            "this place was great!  great food, cocktails, ambience, and view of all the city lights at night.  it's located on the 2nd floor of the fashion mall across from trump towers.  i had one of their specials that was basically a chicken dish of chicken kabob-type pieces with chicken <mark>Meatball</mark> and chopped peppers, onions, and quartered potatoes. the hubs had <mark><mark><mark>Chicken Parmesan</mark></mark></mark> that came with a side of spaghetti.  everything is a la carte so we also ordered dinner salads.  great mojitos & vodka martinis. the buttered cake with marscapone cream and scoop of ice cream was ah-mazing.  we rolled out of their we were so full.  the place was hopping even at 8:30 pm."

            "i'm surprised this place has four stars, which i think is a little high if you're judging based on taste, but value for your money, this is definitely good value.\n\ni came here a couple nights ago with a very large group (about 14?). we showed up without notice, and they were still able to get a table for us in about half an hour or so. the table ordered off the family style menu where you can only pick two of each course, but can have as much of those courses as you want until you're ready for the next one. we ordered calamari, <mark>Caesar Salad</mark>, another type of salad (i think it was the maggiano's), tomato with mozarella, <mark><mark><mark>Chicken Parmesan</mark></mark></mark>, lasagna, spaghetti with marinara sauce, salmon, tiramisu, and cheesecake. the salads were decent - crisp, and tangy. the mozarella that came with the tomato was not very smooth and a little too 'pizza mozarella' tasting for me. the spaghetti with marinara sauce was my personal favorite, along with some of the other people at the table. it was light, and the spaghetti was cooked to just the right tenderness. the lasagna was very salty and the meat chunky in an unpleasant, crumbly way. it wasn't chewy, cheesy, and meshing with the lasagna layers. \n\nthe cheesecake was really delicious, came with fresh strawberries and whipped cream. mm!\n\nthe service was a little slow and sometimes unmindful of us, but it was fairly busy in the restaurant, so i can understand.\n\ni'd come here for a decent large group setting with fairly cheap eats, but i wouldn't come here for a date or a small intimate group meal.",

            "3 1/2 stars to be fair.\n\ni went to maggiano's for lunch during a business seminar.  don't you just love some free food every once in a while for all your hard work?  it was certainly a nice treat for me!\n\nafter initial introductions and the start of the seminar, food starting coming out of the kitchen.  all served family style which was a bit odd for me because i barely knew the two dozen people in the room!  but ah, not a big deal as long as none of them had herpes or mono...or a cold for that matter.\n\nour appetizer courses came first:  along with warm french bread (excellent) we had the:\n\n*<mark>Tomato Caprese</mark> - tomatoes topped with fresh mozzarella and basil, topped with olive oil and balsamic glaze\n\n*mozzarella marinara - breaded mozzarella with marinara sauce\n\n*<mark>Maggiano's Salad</mark> - iceberg and romaine lettuce with bleu cheese, crispy prosciutoo, red onions, topped with their signature dressing\n\npretty good start!  the salad was crisp, but my fav was the <mark>Tomato Caprese</mark>, sweet and ripe tomatoes with the silky cheese and the acidic touch from the balsamic?  very nice!  i didn't try the mozzarella marinara in trying to keep with my p90x diet...damn you i say tony horton!\n\nnext up was our main courses:\n\n*<mark><mark><mark>Chicken Parmesan</mark></mark></mark> - breaded chicken breasts baked with provolone cheese and marinara sauce over spaghetti\n\n*our famous rigatoni 'd' - rigatoni with herb-roasted chicken, mushrooms, and caramelized onions with a marsala cream sauce\n\n*<mark>Mom's Lasagna</mark>-meat sauce - pasta layered with ricotta cheese, <mark>Meatball</mark>, <mark>Gnocchi & Italian Sausage</mark>, and marinara sauce, topped with provolone cheese and meat sauce\n\nnice!  all were good.  unfortunately, i ate like a banshee here...i dug the <mark><mark><mark>Chicken Parmesan</mark></mark></mark> and <mark>Mom's Lasagna</mark> very much!  the sauce was great, not too sweet, not too tart, and complemented the dishes very well.  oh my thighs...the horror!!!\n\nafter the business presentation dessert was brought out:\n\n*apple crostada - granny smith apples baked in a pastry crust topped with crystallized sugar, topped with caramel sauce and vanilla bean ice cream\n\n*chocolate zuccotto cake - chocolate cake layered with sambuca chocolate mousse, iced with chocolate frosting, then dusted with cocoa powder\n\nat this point i was too full to have any more!  but i gave in and had a bit of the apple crostada.  yummy to my tummy!  the tart apples went well with the sweet sugar crust.  good way to end the meal.  bad way to end my diet!\n\nfood here is great for a chain restaurant.  the ambiance is nice, dark woods and colors.  it would be very nice for a date night out.  i may just come back here again and actually shell out my visa to try more of their dishes.  as a note though, i did look through the menu and see a lot of their dishes are on the pricey side.  but, one dish could probably feed two people easily. \n\nthankful for my one day reprieve...i am back to my p90x diet and the ramblings of the devil's spawn named tony horton.  one more push up or pull up and i think i'm gonna be sick!", 
            "when it comes to vegas restaurants, this would not have been my first choice. there is one near my house and i prefer to eat at places i have never been while i am on vacation, but it was my friends birthday dinner. we had a party of 11, so we had to order off the family style menu. we looked at the menu in advance so we already knew what we would be getting when we got there. we ordered the fried mozzarella and <mark>Stuffed Mushrooms</mark> to start. for entrees we ordered a lobster carbonara, <mark><mark><mark>Chicken Parmesan</mark></mark></mark>, beef medallions and a bow tie pasta. we thought we would get one plate of each, but they brought 2 of each, one for each end of the table.  we where well fed. dessert was my favorite. house made terramissu and apple cobbler. wonderful! \n\nour server was wonderful too. she was very friendly and attentive. our drinks never ran dry. it was a great experience. =)", 
            "not only was the food amazing and reasonably priced for the strip, they were really accommodating to our time crunch because we were seeing a show after.  my table had gnocchi, <mark><mark><mark>Chicken Parmesan</mark></mark></mark>, <mark>Baked Eggplant Parmesan</mark>, and the rigatoni d and they were all extremely good.  the only word of advice is to park in treasure island or the wynn/encore.  the mall parking is far from the restaurant.", 
            "took a recent trip to vegas and after walking around starving me and my bf decided to try out maggiano's.  the ambiance is beautiful with rich furnishings and amazing views of the strip. bread is brought to the table with butter, but there is also olive oil on the table if you prefer to dip with that. we started with an appetizer of <mark>Tomato Caprese</mark> that was very good, next we shared the smaller version of the <mark>Spinach Salad</mark> that was amazing (bacon, pine nuts, super yummy dressing etc), and finally we split a plate of the <mark><mark><mark>Chicken Parmesan</mark></mark></mark> that was a large portion, so big in fact we ended up taking the rest to go in a box. in total, those 3 dishes 1 water and 1 coke was $37 which i thought was very reasonable. the sever was friendly, prompt and attentive. there was also a man with a guitar that would sing you a song at the time if you would like. overall i liked the mood of the restaurant, the romantic feel, delicious food and wonderful service. no complaints.", 
            "this is my fourth visit and the food and service seem pretty much consistent.  ordered the margherita pizza for an appetizer and for my main course i had the spinach and <mark>Chicken & Spinach Manicotti</mark>.  fortunately, i also got to try the linguine di mare and the <mark><mark><mark>Chicken Parmesan</mark></mark></mark> that my party ordered.  they were all delicious but the manicotti has to be my favorite.  \n\nthis is a very inexpensive restaurant with generous portions, so it's definitely worth the try after a long day of shopping.  be sure to call in advance otherwise you'd be waiting as long as an hour and a half to be seated.  ask for a table next to the window with view of lvblvd, not one of the best, but still a pretty sight for you out of towners.", 
            "do not pass go, do not collect $200.....go directly to maggiano's!  i had read the reviews about maggiano's catering to their gluten free patrons and looked forward to our visit.  we were not disappointed.  i asked about a gluten free menu and the waiter told us they didn't have a menu, but almost anything on the menu could be made gluten free.  they even offered to coat the chicken in potato chips and pan fry it if i wanted <mark><mark><mark>Chicken Parmesan</mark></mark></mark>.  someone pinch me, i must be dreaming.  to make our visit even better we happened to come during happy hour when their signature cocktails were only $6.  yes please!  i ended up ordering the lobster carbonara and hubby ordered veal parmesan.  all i can say is wow.  my meal was beyond fantastic.  i fully expected tiny pieces of lobster and was astounded when my plate arrived and there were large chunks of lobster.  both meals were enough for two so we gladly took our leftovers back to our room and had them for lunch the next day.  hubby's grandmother came straight from italy and trust me, these meals rivaled hers.  my only disappointment is we don't have a maggiano's where we live.  seriously, it was that good.", 
            "went here today (22nd aug) whilst in vegas, we haven't left vegas yet and i felt i needed to write a review.\n\neverything from start to finish was horrible. i ordered the <mark><mark><mark>Chicken Parmesan</mark></mark></mark>. the chicken was tough, over cooked and tasteless. it came with a side of spaghetti marinara. the spaghetti was over cooked, mushy and the whole thing was very plain.\nneedless to say i didn't even eat half of my meal.\n\nmy friend ordered some sort of pasta and seafood dish (i cannot remember the name) and despite that naturally having slightly more flavour due to it being seafood, the pasta was mushy also and tasteless. \n\ni asked for bottled water, they brought me tap water which i thought ok cool nevermind... i don't know what they did to the tap water there but (maybe it was the ice cubes they used?) but there was a hideous aftertaste of antiseptic! \n\nour server never checked on us once, because if so i would have told her i disliked my meal and also ordered another drink. we had to ask her for the cheque three times and after we finished eating our meal and were given our cheque, it was 25 minutes before our plates were cleared.\n\nneedless to say i will not be returning.", 
            "i love maggianos. i can't get enough of the famous rigatoni d. & they have the best calamari. i am also in love with the marinara sauce they use for the spaghetti as well as the <mark><mark><mark>Chicken Parmesan</mark></mark></mark>. friendly staff & usually not very crowded when i come here. & i feel like i'm in the 1940s with the music they play. definitely one of my favorite places to eat.", 
            "sara our server was fantastic.  we had a large group of 16 people for our wedding dinner.  i had made reservations 2 weeks in advance. they called the day prior to the reservation to confirm and then they called the morning of the reservation date to get my order for the family style dinner. i selected from the chefs selection menu. lobster baked tilapia, <mark><mark><mark>Chicken Parmesan</mark></mark></mark>, mushroom il fornaio and beef tenderloin medallions. for appetizers we selected the calamari, caprese and bruschetta.  for dessert we selected creme br\\u00fbl\\u00e9e and tiramisu. absolutely everyone enjoyed everything they ate! the meat entrees were all tender and juicy. nothing was over cooked or under cooked. the food was served timely- longest wait was 5 mins between appetizers and entrees.  the portions and amount of food can be described as abundant. the customer service was perfect. they allowed us to bring our wedding cake earlier in day and served it at the end of the wedding feast! i highly recommend them for special events!", 
            "my husband and i stopped in for an early weekend lunch recently. we had the entire place to ourselves for a bit around 11:30. it's attached to the fashion show mall, and it seemed like most were just grabbing a quick bite in the food court instead. \n\ni liked the fact that our server asked if we preferred butter or olive oil and parmesan to go along with our bread. gimme' the oil and parm, please! a pet peeve of mine is that a few select italian restaurants in st. louis want to up-charge for this... yes, seriously. anywho, we carbed out on the stuff. :)\n\ni ordered the chicken and spinach cannelloni, while my husband went with the <mark><mark><mark>Chicken Parmesan</mark></mark></mark>. both lunch portions were friggin' huge! my husband actually had two full breasts of chicken on his plate served with a large side of pasta. four noodles came in my order, and had big chunks of chicken in every bite. we made a good dent in the dishes, but still had plenty left over. we both agreed that it was good, but it didn't compare to the good ole' authentic italian we both love so much.", 
            "this place was great. my dad loves a good spaghetti and <mark>Meatball</mark>, it's his go to favorite meal.  and me myself, i love <mark><mark><mark>Chicken Parmesan</mark></mark></mark>. we went here  when we were visiting my dad in the fall. we had a great, amazing view of the strip, and it was right as the sun going down... perfect.\n\nwe all had great food, and great service. i know it's a chain but it was still good to enjoy it and the environment was great.\n\nhopefully, next trip out to vegas to visit me dad, we can stop again.", 
            "we went for dinner and i made reservations on opentable which is super easy. we arrived and were seated within a couple minutes. the waiter came to the table and we told him that my wife has a gluten allergy and he said that would not be a problem and took our drink order and said he would be back to get our food order. when he came back he had the chef who ask my wife what she wanted and said he could make pretty much anything she wanted and she decided on the <mark><mark><mark>Chicken Parmesan</mark></mark></mark> which she loved. my 11 year old got the mama's lasagna & my 13 year old got the <mark>Fettuccine Alfredo</mark> and they both thought it was epic. i enjoyed my veal parmesan and instead of the spaghetti i asked for the <mark>Fettuccine Alfredo</mark> and they said no problem. i have to say the food was good but the service was great. my wife got the creme br\\u00fbl\\u00e9e for desert which she always enjoys. it has become a must visit when we go to vegas.",

            "i've actually been to maggiano's a few times and when i did it was amazing!  the food, the atmosphere, the service was phenomenal!  however, this review will be on my recent visit, just a couple days ago.\n\nme and my boyfriend decided to go for lunch here to celebrate on him getting a potential new job.  in the beginning, everything was fine.  we ordered our appetizers and... that was it?  he didn't ask if we'd like an entree after taking down our appetizers.  so, we waited for our server to come back and ask if we'd like to order an entree.  after he gave us our appetizer and even finished it, all we saw  him do was helping every other customers but us.  did he have something against us because we \"look\" 16 years old and can't afford an entree???  after about 20-30 minutes of waiting, we asked another server to ask him if he can take down our entree we've been waiting for.  he comes over and he goes, \"okay go ahead.\"  he didn't apologize for making us wait.  really??  wow.  i'm appalled by his performance.  and after we got our entree, he only came over to us twice, third time being check, and we never saw him again.\n\nthe saving grace to our experience was the food.  our appetizers were the <mark>Crispy Zucchini Fritt</mark> and <mark>Stuffed Mushrooms</mark>.  i loved how crunchy the zucchini was and the soupy base for the mushroom was great!  our entrees were the rigatoni d and <mark><mark><mark>Chicken Parmesan</mark></mark></mark>.  he enjoyed his parmesan very much and the rigatoni was very fulfilling and the cream sauce complimented the whole dish so well!  the little mushrooms in it was too cute to eat!\n\nwe're always going to come back here.  just not have that older server again.", 
            "we thoroughly enjoyed our meal here. we were able to get a seat quickly. \n\nbread service was my favorite part. balsamic vinegar in olive oil to dip the bread. yummy!!!  \n\ni had the <mark>Fettuccine Alfredo</mark> while my husband had <mark><mark><mark>Chicken Parmesan</mark></mark></mark>. huge portions that we had wrapped up for later. our daughter inhaled her ravioli. included in her kid's meal was ice cream. instead of shouting out about the ice cream in front of our daughter our fabulous server asked my husband discreetly if it was ok for her to have it. loved that!!!!!! \n\nprice was decent. food was terrific. service was fabulous. definitely recommend.",

            "i was walking the length of the strip and that's a long way! i sort of scoped out all the lunch places, and besides fast food at a mall, this seemed like the most affordable lunch spot that might be nice. i didn't need to spend $70 on lunch at some place that was trying to make me think i was in paris or something. \n\nmaggiano's is located at the edge of the fashion show mall. we arrived for a late lunch and got a nice seat by the windows. this is more or less a sort of upscale place, not a grab lunch and go kinda place. our server seemed quite professional ... but then the up selling began. just say no and keep with what you want! the wine pours come in 2 sizes, 6 and 8 oz. wine prices are not that cheap here though. the food was quite varied on the menu. one of the great deals i spotted was the soup and half sandwich for $9.95. i selected the cesar salad and <mark><mark><mark>Chicken Parmesan</mark></mark></mark> half sandwich. my bf had the cesar salad and the italian grilled cheese & ham. the server brought over bread while we waited.which was scrumptious dipped in the olive oil and balsamic vinegar.\n\n when our food arrived, i was surprised by the portions, nice and big! the salad was a decent size and the sandwich was more than enough to eat. i was expecting a real half of a sandwich from a bread loaf cut into a little triangle ...like mom used to make you! it was served on a nice italian roll and was very good indeed. i'll say this is one of the better deals in vegas on the strip. although with the wine, tax and tip, we still ended up with a near $50 lunch for 2! oh, well, skip the wine next time! i will say though, this so far is one of my fave places i've eaten at here in vegas so far. the food is very good here, and not just a slop job cause it tourists."

            "we've always liked our normally pretty flawless dining experiences here.  but on this particular occasion, when of course i was introducing the restaurant to two friends, the wheels of service largely came off the tracks.  we had reserved a booth that overlooked picture windows facing strip hotels across the street, but it wasn't ready when we arrived.  we had to wait about 20 minutes for a booth to be cleared, which was no big deal.  but it established a pattern of service being at least two beats behind all night.\n\nfor starters, i ordered <mark>Calamari Fritt</mark> and crab & shrimp imperial, a special of the day.  i also ordered a cup of <mark>Tuscan Chicken Sausage</mark> & orzo soup and a side of <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> before my entree of linguine & clams.  bread arrived first, which was good and crusty.  but our iced teas and soft drinks were not brought forth until 10 minutes after the presentation of bread, evo, and butter.  and, one soft drink was missing.  so were two of four bread plates and a knife.  \n\nsoon afterward, the appetizers arrived.  unfortunately, so did both my soup and salad.  four items were plopped on the table at the same time--all of them mine.  although jammed up with food, i did my best to race through the appetizers before my soup got cold, and largely succeeded by taking half of each appetizer home.  the crab & shrimp imperial, consisting of crab-stuffed lobster with herb bread crumbs and lobster cream sauce over orzo pasta, was simply excellent.  it was also very filling.  the deep-fried calamari was uncharacteristically undercooked, but still fairly tasty--especially dipped in the lemon aioli that was prepared on request.  the accompanying marinara sauce was also good and mellow.  \n\nas before, the <mark>Tuscan Chicken Sausage</mark> & orzo soup did not disappoint.  the fennel-flavored soup packed an unusual but welcome taste of mild sausage, fresh tomatoes, celery, and white beans.  the side of <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> was a generous helping of cool and crisp romaine greens with focaccia croutons and grated parmesan cheese.  linguine & clams with invisible but tasty white clam sauce was a nice pasta dish that boasted both fresh and chopped clams.  but, unfortunately, only 7 fresh clams were present, which not only seemed meager but were far less than i had enjoyed on a previous occasion.  and, i bit down on a small piece of clam shell that was included in the mix.   \n\ngarlic bread focaccia was not very garlicky at all.  and, inexplicably, the cheesy fontina potatoes that my wife had ordered did not arrive at our table until 20 minutes beyond the third of three promises of \"2 minutes longer\" by our server, just after our packaged leftovers had been handed to us.  obviously, we didn't want additional starch any more at a point when we were about to leave the premises.  after an apology by our server that seemed sincere, the still steaming potatoes were packaged in a baking tin and presented to us again without charge.\n\nthe quality of ingredients and tastiness of what i ate were mostly sound as always.  and, kudos and an extra 1/2-star to restaurant management for calling to report that my missing kindle had been found on the floor of our booth, before i raced back to retrieve it right after midnight.  so, 3-1/2 stars on an off night.", 
            "it was new year's day, and another visit to maggiano's.  this dinner really started the year off right!  \n\nrustic bread was very good, and golden <mark>Calamari Fritt</mark> was again excellent alternately dipped in a specially requested lemon aioli, along with a mild marinara sauce.  a filling bowl of <mark>Tuscan Chicken Sausage</mark> & orzo soup was outstanding, and a small chopped <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> with a light and delicious creamy caesar dressing, big crunchy croutons, and parmesan splinters was nice and cool.\n\nalthough we had to ask for one round of water refills, and meat sauce was first mistakenly brought to diane's side of our booth, these minor lapses were quickly corrected, and otherwise service was excellent, as is usually the case here.  my entree of spaghetti & meatball in meat sauce was very fine indeed, with a large dense meatball, al dente spaghetti, and a mild sweet sauce.  for diane, roasted red potatoes served on request in lieu of pasta were simply prepared and excellent tasting.  i asked for a few mushrooms to be added to my meat sauce, and they were.  there was no charge levied for this or the aioli, although i would have gladly paid for these graciously given extras.\n\nonce again, five-star dining--on a holiday, when expectations are highest.  this time they were even exceeded!", 
            "another year later, and another new year's day meal at maggiano's--this time with friends.  food was as fine as usual, but this time there were just too many service errors to overlook.  i had to separately ask for more bread three times, and butter another three times before they were finally produced.  a table knife was taken away without substituting a replacement, and no serving spoon was provided for potatoes.  so one star was lost.\n\ncomplimentary italian bread had a nice doughy texture.  <mark>Calamari Fritt</mark> with marinara sauce and specially requested lemon aioli featured perfectly cooked golden tentacles and rings.  and mozzarella marinara consisted of four rectangles of slightly browned fried cheese.  \n\na side <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> with requested anchovies was crunchy and excellent.  and a bowl of <mark>Tuscan Chicken Sausage</mark> soup was very good except for hard included celery.  fontina potatoes were oozing with white cheese, and my entree of linguine & clams with white clam sauce, 12 littleneck clams in open shells, and several pieces of chopped clams was quite delicious.", 
            "i have visited numerous maggiano's locations over the years and have loved every visit...until this one.  maggiano's has always delivered an excellent, consistent product.  this visit the service was not outstanding.  we ordered the <mark>Tuscan Chicken Sausage</mark> soup which was served cold.  i also ordered the lasagna (which they're well known for) which was also served cold and the sauce was nearly flavorless.  i would've been more satisfied with a stauffers frozen lasagna.  i hope the las vegas location management does some serious quality control, trains the staff, and realizes that vegas is a very competitive market before they're out of business.  i'll be looking for a new italian location in las vegas."

            "i'm surprised this place has four stars, which i think is a little high if you're judging based on taste, but value for your money, this is definitely good value.\n\ni came here a couple nights ago with a very large group (about 14?). we showed up without notice, and they were still able to get a table for us in about half an hour or so. the table ordered off the family style menu where you can only pick two of each course, but can have as much of those courses as you want until you're ready for the next one. we ordered calamari, <mark>Caesar Salad</mark>, another type of salad (i think it was the maggiano's), tomato with mozarella, <mark><mark><mark>Chicken Parmesan</mark></mark></mark>, lasagna, spaghetti with marinara sauce, salmon, tiramisu, and cheesecake. the salads were decent - crisp, and tangy. the mozarella that came with the tomato was not very smooth and a little too 'pizza mozarella' tasting for me. the spaghetti with marinara sauce was my personal favorite, along with some of the other people at the table. it was light, and the spaghetti was cooked to just the right tenderness. the lasagna was very salty and the meat chunky in an unpleasant, crumbly way. it wasn't chewy, cheesy, and meshing with the lasagna layers. \n\nthe cheesecake was really delicious, came with fresh strawberries and whipped cream. mm!\n\nthe service was a little slow and sometimes unmindful of us, but it was fairly busy in the restaurant, so i can understand.\n\ni'd come here for a decent large group setting with fairly cheap eats, but i wouldn't come here for a date or a small intimate group meal.", 
            "a great place to visit if you are sick of the hotel buffets! the atmosphere was nice and cozy. we came in on a saturday night and our option was to wait 4 minutes or sit at the bar for dinner. we sat at the bar! the food was great, huge portions! we figured out after the fact that they specialize in family portions. i ordered the half order of lobster ravioli and it was delicious! five huge raviolis stuffed with big chunks of lobster and a great sauce! the portion of sauce was just right, it was not drowning in it! my friend ordered the <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> and when they brought it out we actually started laughing because it was so huge! he managed to eat the whole thing though! as for drinks i had the watermelon martini and he had the classic martini...both were great! i would definitely visit again...", 
            "my husband and i love to take the family to maggiano's when we're in las vegas.  the food is amazing but be sure to bring your appetite!  it's family style so it's obviously huge but the portions here seem to be exceptionally large - even for family style. the stuffed mushroom appetizer, the <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> and the linguine/clams in red sauce are my recommendations. the service at this restaurant is amazing, as well. my drink was never  empty, they timed each course perfectly so that i was never with too little or too much food at my table and my leftovers were whisked away and returned in cute little brown packages before i had time to even notice they were gone.  great experience!\n\nthe restaurant is, also, on a great part of the strip so you can walk off all the food you just ate while taking in the sights.", 
            "i have been here many times, and each time i have been impressed with the restaurant and all it has to offer. the food here is fantastic - i highly recommend the flat breads or <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> for an appetizer. also, you are missing out if you do not order the four cheese ravioli. if you come to the restaurant with a large group, they have a great family style option. however, this option is only available for groups of four or over. do not waste your calories/money if your group is smaller than this - it is not worth it, and you will have to take food home.",

            "we were struggling with trying to have a good reasonably priced dinner for 22 in las vegas. everyplace we called wanted us to rent a private room, order from a pricey  catering menu and guarantee a minimum. believe it or not, the totals were coming up to almost  five thousand dollars  including liquor,  tip tax and service charges.  we decided to have the dinner in our suite at <mark>Caesar</mark> and have maggiano's deliver. best decision ever. ashley guided us through the process and we had tons of great food at a fraction of the cost. they delivered on time, set everything up and left. we even had leftovers for lunch the next day. the food was actually better than i thought it would be. bread, desert,  salad, entrees, everything was great. would use this place again.  total tab was under $500. we spent another hundred at the liquor store setting up our bar. even if you add the cost of our 2 bedroom suite, we're still ahead. first time i won in vegas.   great night.", 
            "extremely overrated and not impressive, at all. \n\ni went here for a business lunch and i arrived a bit early. the hostesses were very rude, rather than nicely say we're not open yet, they had an attitude that was like go the **** away. not a good start. \n\nwhen i finally get in i head to the back where yes, they have a screen setup and a sound system. but the projector is being leveled by paper towels and was amateurish at best. and the room we were in needed paint. seriously, when you take a look around the podium was chipped, the walls had chips, and i'm thinking for a place overlooking las vegas blvd that the experience was downgraded. it may have been classy a while back, but the management team needs to consider investing in a little bit of paint. \n\nthen we get to the wobbly tables, and the family style food that was brought out. family style might work in italy but this is america, and to me family style is a masquerade for a kitchen that is too slow or chokes at cranking out high volume high quality plates. in this case about the only thing good was the <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> as it's hard to muck up a <mark>Caesar Salad</mark>. but the rest of the food? truly unmemorable. if i was a tourist and i walked in expecting the place to live up even partially to it's \"little italy\" name i would have felt like i was the victim of a mafia shakedown. \n\nlong story short yelp may have this place ranked at 4 stars, but there's not enough wine in italy that could make me intoxicated enough to give it anything over 2. and that's only because i'm trying to be diplomatic about it. needless to say if it wasn't for business functions i won't be back. \n\n(note to staff: it takes money to make money. investing in simple, functional equipment and paint is a start. next, they're called spices. surely in the recipes that are used there's a line or two for various spices. your food was barely 1 notch above cafeteria food, no wait, i think a high school aged line cook at golden corral in amarillo texas could prepare better food than what i had.)\n\nyou should be ashamed to slap the word \"italy\" anywhere near your doors. i better stop typing before i end up clicking on just one star instead of two.", 
            "on my last outing to this venerable restaurant overlooking the strip on the edge of fashion show, maggiano's redeemed itself with a fine repast and picturesque view of encore.  our telephoned request for a booth with a strip view was honored despite the chagrined look of other hopefuls whom the maitre d' had to fend off to preserve our pre-reserved perch.  golden <mark>Calamari Fritt</mark> was on point and well made this time.  both rings and tentacles were lightly deep fried and excellent with great requested lemon aioli and mild marinara sauce.  bread and butter were very good, and, as always, a bowl of savory tuscan orzo & sausage soup sporting <mark>Gnocchi & Italian Sausage</mark>, fennel, white beans, fresh tomatoes, and plenty of orzo was excellent.  where this soup is concerned, to enjoy more stomach-warming, fluid rustic goodness i now always order a bowl rather than a mere cup.\n\na side <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> with grated parmesan and focaccia croutons in a creamy caesar dressing was excellent.  and, stuffed chicken pizzaiola with mozzarella, ricotta, tropheo pasta, pomodoro, red peppers, and pepperoncini was fine once i got to the middle of the chicken.  it was similar to chicken cordon bleu but zestier.  as usual, a side of fontina potatoes was creamy and delicious.  \n\nthis time we experienced excellent service as noel, our server, without any prodding, carefully spaced out our meal orders so that the various dishes would not come out of the kitchen on top of each other.  all went well except for me killing one of my favorite polo shirts with food stains from marinara sauce followed by splatters from the orzo & sausage soup.  after treating the stubborn marks with both zout and goo gone, after six washings they still remain.  i will not give up either the sauce or the soup.  but next time i am in their close proximity, regardless of appearances i will don a napkin to protect the front of whatever shirt i may be wearing at the time!\n\nfor a chain, this is truly a fine one!", 
            "another night at maggiano's, and another excellent dinner!  \n\nwe started with fine complimentary warm bread and butter in our reserved booth with a window view of the strip, and moved on to enjoy outstanding <mark>Calamari Fritt</mark>--excellent tentacles and first-rate golden rings, along with the cheerfully provided lemon aioli we had requested to accompany marinara sauce.\n\na bowl of orzo & sausage soup was also well prepared and excellent as a whole,  with sausage just tangy enough to make it intriguing.  although iced teas regularly arrived unbidden, i had to ask for butter twice.  it was quickly produced after the second request.\n\ncold crisp romaine leaves bathed in a thin application of a nice traditional caesar dressing, and small crunchy croutons dominated an excellent side <mark>Caesar Salad</mark>.  belatedly i asked for a single anchovy (semi-health consciousness at work!) and it was duly brought in its own ceramic cup to further enhance this course. \n\ngreat cheesy fontina potatoes represented a perfect blend of cooked potato slices and fontina cheese, and were more than enough to share with diane.  this time my entree of linguini & clams was superb, with a fine light white wine sauce, 9 clams still in the beds of their opened shells, and a generous amount of supplemental chopped clams.  meanwhile, diane did her best to attack 3 large medallions of veal parm with excellent yummy alfredo sauce accompanied by al dente rigatoni alfredo.  at meal's end she still had enough food left over for a very satisfying lunch two days later, and we were both too full to order dessert.\n\nonce again i unintentionally dropped and left items under our dining table.  this time when i pulled up on the driveway of my north las vegas home, i found that both a filled pill case and all of my house keys were missing from my coat pocket.  after a call to the restaurant and a check under our former table by restaurant management, all items were found.  so, for the second time in 13 months after dining here, i headed back to fashion show mall, and retrieved my dropped items from the check-in desk.  they had been found on the floor of the same booth where my kindle had been inadvertently abandoned on a previous visit.  so, in the future i either have to avoid this particular booth or take better care of my important personal possessions.  i think i will concentrate on the latter course of action!",

            "great atmosphere. for appetizer we had the <mark>Crispy Zucchini Fritt</mark> which was my husbands favorite. we also ordered a side of <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> which needed more dressing so we asked for more. we also ordered the <mark>Creamy Tomato Basil</mark> soup, not the best soup ive had, it's too watery and not enough of the tomato taste more basil. for our entree we got the chicken marsala the lighter version and my husband said the chicken was dried. i had the alfredo fettuccine with chicken. my alfredo sauce was alright, not my favorite i think olive garden has better alfredo fettuccine. overall not bad for lunch but for italian food it was decent price and the waitress was really nice!", 
            "i came to maggiano's celebrate another yelper terri r birthday with family and friends. it was my first visit so never had much came to expectations. truthfully left with nothing exciting or inspiring comes to review. if there was one thing that stood out more then the food was the service was awesome. our waitresses really wish remember her name cause she deserve shout out in otherwise a-ok review. she was super friendly, cracking jokes with everyone keeping the atmosphere positive/festive, on top of our every needs, and personnel touches stood out for me. she had whole separate dessert just for birthday girl. just happen she was not at the table so took the dessert back and waited for birthday girl come back light the table right in front of her. great service.\n\nsince it was decent size party we had nine. terri was able to order family style meal. it reminded me bucca di beppo style. starters we had fried calamari, spinach and artichoke dip, and <mark>Caesar Salad</mark>. entrees not sure the filling believe ricotta raviolis with tomato sauce, spaghetti with tomato sauce, chicken marsala think, and lasagna. dessert chocolate cake, and one more forgot. by the time got to the dessert was stuffed. none of the dishes had wow factor at all. some of them felt like lack any depth of flavor. the tomato sauce in the spaghetti and am sure same base sauce use on the lasagna. bland not even sure if they put salt or pepper in it. the portion size got nothing to say except nice and generous. the pricing not all that bad for strip restaurant. the atmosphere is upscale but looking at the prices reasonable. it located in the fashion show mall so parking is ample and whether you valet or not easy access. \n\noverall so many more italian restaurant in vegas that are just as reasonable that food taste so much better. on this night it celebration beastmode terri r. not about the food but supporting family. happy birthday terri r.!!!!", 
            "really disappointing..went here with my wife for a \"date night\" out..first our hostess..a business's first impression..was too busy reading a book to pay attention to anything going on around her..including guests waiting..but she did at least put the book inside one of your wine lists to try and make it look like she had been studying that..hmmm..need to work on being conspicuous..next..we were sat and about 5 minutes later were greeted..i think his name was dave..very \"blah\" attitude and so quiet when talking that we could not hear anything he was saying..and very very slow service..we had ordered our drinks (peach ice tea and raspberry lemonade) which tasted like pure syrup. we ordered the tomato soup, a <mark>Caesar Salad</mark>, and the bruschetta of which he recommended which had bacon, ricotta, and arugula..this was pretty good. the bread that we got..your \"complementary bread\" he had dropped off at table with olive oil..we had wanted balsamic but could not find our server and couldn't get hostess attention (too busy with her book)..tomato soup tastes out of a can and was watery..with one salad crouton in..really?..it took the server a good 10-15 minutes just to come back to get our entree order..we ordered the chicken and shrimp baked pasta and a carbonara for my wife..the carbonara came out..had good flavor, but sauce was really thin and plate set up was on a 15 inch oval..very poor presentation..looked like a sample amount..mine had zero sauce and was bland..chicken tastes like it was boiled in a pot..we were never checked back on to see how things were..defiantly was a strike out for this restaurant..we have never dined here before, but was told in the past that food was good...food, service, and hospitality was not worth the $70 meal.", 
            "we went yesterday for my sisters birthday and we ordered from the lunch family style menu which is basically buffet style.  \n\nthe last time we were here were a few years ago and it seems like they changed up the menu because we were able to chose more dishes before and now we are limited to 1-2 items per category.  \n\nso you get to chose 1 salad, 1 appetizer, 2 pastas and 2 desserts for $23 per person (it use to be 2 for each i believe - my aunt was really disappointed).\n\nthey come out with the first plate and if you want more, you order 2nd or 3rd's according to how many people want extra.  (they do allow for you to take things home but they've become quite strict on finishing the first plate first).  \n\nthey do have gluten-free penne pasta so i was able to eat that.  \n\nwe ordered the <mark>Caesar Salad</mark>, calamari, clams and linguine, gluten free <mark>Taylor Street Baked Ziti</mark>, tiramisu, and the double fudge brownie.\n\nthe salad was a huge let down - the lettuce was super soggy.\nthe calamari was awesome, light batter and fried to perfection.\neveryone who had the clams said the first dish was too salty and the second dish that came out was way better.\nthe <mark>Taylor Street Baked Ziti</mark> had sausage in it and i usually love sausage but i didn't care for theres.  \nthe tiramisu was delicious and the brownie dish came with ice cream and strawberries.  my nephew and i had the strawberries while everyone else ate the super chocolatey brownie.\n\nit was nice to get together with family and eat a buffet without having to get up.  our server was nice but could have came around just a tab bit more.",

            "i came here a couple months ago during my vacation in las vegas. i was skeptical to try maggiano's out since they were a chain restaurant but i would be pleasantly surprised. unfortunately no locations in canada (where i'm from) yet! this maggianos is located in the fashion show mall next to wynn and encore hotels. \n\nmaggiano's isn't exactly fine-dining, but it does have a pretty nice ambiance for a family style restaurant. it has full panoramic glass windows around the perimeter of the dining room, showcasing an awesome view of the wynn hotel and that part of the strip. while we were there, two violinists went around the restaurant playing songs for each table. and to top it off, our server was so kind and helpful!\n\nthe menu here is also pretty interesting and worth a mention. along side the regular a la cart menu, they also have a \"family style\" menu. basically you choose several items from a predetermined set, and for a fixed price per pereson, you can order as much of any item you want! its kind of like \"all-you-can-eat\" but for only the few items you choose. we ended up going for this option and ordered the light family dinner that comes with bottomless portions for 2 appetizers, 2 salads, and 2 pastas.\n\n<mark>Maggiano's Salad</mark> : \nthis salad is literally the best salad i've ever had! the signature house dressing was a spicy-sweet vinaigrette, and paired with the crunchy prosciutto bits, i could not for the life of me stop eating this!\n\n<mark>Crispy Zucchini Fritt</mark> : \nthe waiter said this was their most popular appetizer, and i can see why. the zucchinis are deep fried in a crumbly crunchy batter, and were irresistible with the cool ranch dip\n\nlinguine and clams with white clam sauce: \ni did not like this at all. the sauce was runny, and tasted like fishy sea water. it was way too salty.\n\nour famous rigatoni 'd' \\u00ae :\n guess they don't call it \"famous\" for nothing, this pasta is really really good! the pasta is cooked perfectly al dente, and is served with lots of mushrooms and creamy marsala sauce. \n\nfor a chain, this place really isn't bad! you'll leave for the most part happy and full :)",

            "i've heard about maggiano's for awhile and finally got the chance to eat at one of their restaurants when i was in vegas for business.  since there were 7 of us, we decided to order family style...  $31 a head and we choose two appetizers, two salads, two pastas, two entrees, and two desserts, all you can eat!\n\nwe ordered the calamari and mussels, chopped and <mark>Italian Tossed Salad</mark>, spaghetti and <mark>Meatball</mark> and linguine with clams (white sauce) the chicken marsala and tilapia, and the tiramisu and s'mores special dessert.  calamari was great, but i was a little disappointed in the mussels.  too many white beans in the mix for me.  the salads were good.  linguine was good and the <mark>Meatball</mark> on the spaghetti were huge! the tilapia wasn't too fishy and was nice and moist and we loved the chicken marsala.  both desserts were great as well.\n\nbig points for our waiter, noel, as well.  he was very helpful, professional, and attentive through our stay.  he encouraged us to eat more and even gave us many containers to take home our leftovers in.  the spaghetti and chicken marsala were still great the next day, as well as the desserts!", 
            "we made reservations for maggiano's through yelp...and it was so fast and easy!  i would highly recommend making reservations through yelp, if it has the option.  i believe it was linked to foursquare?? not sure though.  \n\nwe took my mom out for a late mother's day dinner.  it wasn't crowded; which was great...though it got a bit crowded after 6pm.  while, we waited for my mom to arrive we sat at the bar.  my husband got a beer and he got a little surprise!  the glass in which the bartender poured the beer had a lipstick mark.  it was gross.  he told the bartender and looked at it in shock.  he gladly switched it out.  \n\nwe went with the family style \"classic\" option which includes 2 appetizers, salads and desserts & 4 entrees.  we got the calamari and zucchini for appetizer.  the ceasar and <mark>Spinach Salad</mark>.  the chicken parm, grilled salmon, spaghetti w/ <mark>Meatball</mark> and gnocchi w/ <mark>Gnocchi & Italian Sausage</mark>.  spumoni ice cream and tiramisu for dessert.  my favorite was the calamari, cesar salad, chicken parm and desserts...everything else is okay.  i didn't care to much for the salmon, though.  the portions were huge; had to take a lot of it home.  i didn't understand how they just put the ice cream in a warm bowl...by the time we got it, it was melted.  maybe they should put it in an ice bowl??  the waiter was nice and service was quick.  view is nice...oversees the wynn properties.  there is also a man that walks around in his violin to play music for you; which i believe you have to tip him. \n\nit's a good place to eat if there is a big group of you and craving italian food.", 
            "on my last outing to this venerable restaurant overlooking the strip on the edge of fashion show, maggiano's redeemed itself with a fine repast and picturesque view of encore.  our telephoned request for a booth with a strip view was honored despite the chagrined look of other hopefuls whom the maitre d' had to fend off to preserve our pre-reserved perch.  golden <mark>Calamari Fritt</mark> was on point and well made this time.  both rings and tentacles were lightly deep fried and excellent with great requested lemon aioli and mild marinara sauce.  bread and butter were very good, and, as always, a bowl of savory tuscan orzo & sausage soup sporting <mark>Gnocchi & Italian Sausage</mark>, fennel, white beans, fresh tomatoes, and plenty of orzo was excellent.  where this soup is concerned, to enjoy more stomach-warming, fluid rustic goodness i now always order a bowl rather than a mere cup.\n\na side <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> with grated parmesan and focaccia croutons in a creamy caesar dressing was excellent.  and, stuffed chicken pizzaiola with mozzarella, ricotta, tropheo pasta, pomodoro, red peppers, and pepperoncini was fine once i got to the middle of the chicken.  it was similar to chicken cordon bleu but zestier.  as usual, a side of fontina potatoes was creamy and delicious.  \n\nthis time we experienced excellent service as noel, our server, without any prodding, carefully spaced out our meal orders so that the various dishes would not come out of the kitchen on top of each other.  all went well except for me killing one of my favorite polo shirts with food stains from marinara sauce followed by splatters from the orzo & sausage soup.  after treating the stubborn marks with both zout and goo gone, after six washings they still remain.  i will not give up either the sauce or the soup.  but next time i am in their close proximity, regardless of appearances i will don a napkin to protect the front of whatever shirt i may be wearing at the time!\n\nfor a chain, this is truly a fine one!", 
            "atmosphere and service were great; however the food was just average. \n\nlobster carbonara tasted like what you would expect from the olive garden.\n<mark>Gnocchi & Italian Sausage</mark> flat bread was ok as well.\n\nthere are plenty of other restaurants in vegas that i would try again.",

            "viva' las vegas, was my destination this weekend. and decided to take the girlfriend and parents to dinner here. i always enjoy this place. did the family style, and if you never done family style food, well get on it. its fun. \n\ngreat food, from appetizers to entree's and also the desserts.. everyone agreed the <mark>Mom's Lasagna</mark> was amazing, the gnocchi & <mark>Gnocchi & Italian Sausage</mark> was incredible , the  crab & shrimp cannelloni was to die for, and linguine & clams,\nred or white clam sauce was out of this site. \n\nso heads up if you do go, maybe call ahead of time, its a super busy place. we totally lucked out and sat outside since it was nice evening. but inside is very nice. do you need to dress up? i would say at least wear a collar shirt guys.. \n\nour waitress for the evening was very helpful and very fun. the only problem it took a while for us to get our appetizers, which she apoligized all night long. we didn't mind, we had our drinks in hand and having a good time. but other then that another great experience in the book.. hope you guys enjoy. because the food is amazing..", 
            "the food and service was great. our server, rafael, was so helpful. he made several suggestions that helped us to decide what to order without breaking the bank or over stuffing ourselves. \nwe reserved online, got there a bit early and got seated within a couple of minutes.\n\nrafael explained that anything and everything on the menu could be modified to our desire - different noodle, sauce, substitution of an ingredient, etc. so we ordered the seafood linguine and substituted shrimp for mussels. came out totally delicious. appetizers were $4 until 6:30pm so we ordered italian <mark>Chicken <mark><mark>Gnocchi & Italian Sausage</mark> Flatbread</mark></mark>. delicious! we were too full for dessert but wanted a tasted of the tiramisu - our favorited. rafael suggested the sampler tiramisu for a fraction of the regular price. we went for it and were surprised by the still good sized portion. again it was perfect. \nrafael also gave us suggestions for tours and shows. \nour experience was fantastic. we couldn't stop talking about it to our family and will try maggiano's in san jose", 
            "i used to like maggiano and think it was one of my favorite italian chain place. however, i have not been back to this place for at least 3 years because there are so many italian restaurants in town. i came back last night for my friends bday and found out they've changed their menu quite a bit. i guess my palate has changed as well and became more picky. i wasn't completely satisfied. \n\ni was surprised that they don't have any pesto sauce on any dish. they also took always the half/ full size. they only have one size for their entrees  now where it's more for individuals rather than sharing. i guess that makes more sense for the restaurants on the profit sides.\n\nafter i sat down, it took the server 10 minutes to bring me some water and then another 5 or 10 minutes to take my drink order. even though i was the only one who arrived in our table, i was bit annoyed by it. the server was friendly though. i wasn't sure if they were under staffed or he's just keep forgetting about me. \n\ni was not impressed by any of the pasta we tried. we tried <mark>Fettuccine Alfredo</mark>, gnocchi and <mark>Gnocchi & Italian Sausage</mark>, and <mark>Shrimp Scampi</mark>. alfredo sauce was not creamy enough. i like the vodka cream sauce in gnocchi but gnocchi was overcooked. i don't think i will return anytime soon.", 
            "love their lighter fare option! while yes, maggianos is known for their large portions and ahem, rich (calorie laden) flavors, this was a nice surprise. i had the chicken piccata and thoroughly enjoyed it! i didn't think any of the flavor was lost, but yes, the portion was a bit smaller than what i'm used to there. however, it was still filling.\n\nhubby had the linguini de mare, which was really good (not lighter fare). we started with the maggiano salad (him) and <mark>Italian Tossed Salad</mark> (me) and both really enjoyed our respective orders.\n\nwe shared the toasted pound cake with caramelized bananas for dessert and it was deeeelish! \n\nour server was seidi and i highly recommend asking for her section. we eat out quite often and the service we experienced from her was the best we've had in a while!",

            "my friends & i had a very pleasant dining experience here when they rented out one of the private rooms at maggiano's as the lunch reception for their 10-year wedding vow renewal. we had 3 tables that seated about 10-12 people. there was plenty of room for a display table as well. and there was also an adjacent balcony with a view of the strip & encore. they had a specially tailored menu with their names on it as well as at the door upon entering the room (we had to correct them on the spelling when we arrived & they corrected it before the families arrived). overall the service and the experience was a positive one. i think it's safe to say the guests & celebrants enjoyed their time at maggiano's. i'd advise you to valet outside because the elevator by valet takes you right up to restaurant. my friend that lives in town gave me that nugget of information. so convenient...\n\nnow on to the menu: first course was <mark>Stuffed Mushrooms</mark>, calamari & <mark>Italian Tossed Salad</mark>. the <mark>Stuffed Mushrooms</mark> were good. they were big mushrooms and it was stuffed with spinach and bread crumbs. they were served in a white wine sauce. you cant go wrong with calamari and their version didn't disappoint. fresh tasting pieces of breaded squid accompanied with marinara sauce for dipping. just squeeze some lemon over the calamari and you're golden. the <mark>Italian Tossed Salad</mark> was surprisingly delicious. salad had arugula, lettuce, pepperoncinis & croutons in italian dressing. good appetizers. i enjoyed every single one of them. \n\nsecond course consisted of meat lasagna, rustic chicken & shrimp and chicken marsala. i loved the meat lasagna. but really, what's not to love? it's lasagna! and it was classically delicious. they don't call it \"mom's meat lasagna with meat sauce\" for nothing. crumbled <mark>Meatball</mark> & sausage with ricotta cheese. boom! i didnt have the rustic chicken & shrimp but my friend's seemed to like it. the chicken marsala was so very good. white meat chicken that was so moist and tasty. it was the perfect chicken dish. i loved it the most... and that's saying a lot given that lasagna was on the menu. order it. trust me.\n\nfor dessert, we had 2 offerings. chocolate zucotto cake & nonna's toasted pound cake. all i had was the toasted pound cake & that's all i needed. it was so damn good. crispy edges on the pound cake topped with a scoop of vanilla bean ice cream, slivers of chocolate and served along side caramelized bananas. game over. i dont have to tell you how good it was. you already know. \n\nyou're welcome...", 
            "i spend quite some time during the week at fashion show mall for various reasons and maggiano's is a tough place to beat. every dining occasion i've had here has been more than enjoyable. \n\nwe were seated right away and our server this time around was great. i was impressed with how often he checked up on our table and he took the time to hold a conversation with our family.\n \ni tried their lobster carbonara and their <mark>Chicken <mark><mark>Gnocchi & Italian Sausage</mark> Flatbread</mark></mark> has always been a favorite! if you haven't tried, this is worth a share around the table. \n\nfood is always prepared as quickly as possible but still maintains its quality and taste. will definitely return for many meals to come!", 
            "impressive impressive... this is rock solid italian comfort food for sure.  couples night out and we opted for the family style menu options, for a party of four you can pick three starters, four main dishes and two desserts.  we selected the mozzarella, calamari and <mark>Italian Tossed Salad</mark>, all three items were great and plentiful.  the fried mozzarella was my favorite one but the salad and dressing were just as good.  for entrees we ordered all pasta items with the standouts being the lasagna and manicotti dishes.  for dessert we tried the chocolate cake and cheesecake.  i'm not a chocolate person so i didn't try it but the cheesecake was devine.  we actually ended up with two pieces to match the size of the chocolate cake.  portions are huge enough for 5-6 really.  the bread was also really yummy with balsamic and oil.  i think this will be a regular stop on future vegas trips this was a great dining experience!"

            "we decided to stop here and have lunch. boy am i glad that we did! maggiano's was delicious!! i really regret not taking pictures of our food but i was enjoying it so much that i was too busy stuffing my face and didn't think to pull out the camera. \n\ni'm a total soup girl, so after hearing the day's selection of soups, i decided on a cup of roasted mushroom soup. when it arrived my jaw dropped. i asked for a cup (or small ...whatever) and it arrived in a huge bowl!! the portions were huge! i even waited and double checked with our server that they didn't make a mistake and give me the bigger size bowl of soup and she said \"nope, that's the small one\". well, the soup was delicious. it was full of mushrooms in a cream base and was sooooo yummyyy!!!  my mom ordered the \"small\" <mark>Spinach Salad</mark> and that was delicious as well. never had roasted red peppers in a <mark>Spinach Salad</mark> and it surprisingly gave great flavor with the smoked bacon, crumbled gorgonzola, sweet onions and toasted pine nuts. we would have been just fine with our soup and salad but little did we know that the portions were going to be so huge!\n\nokay, entree time...we both went with sandwhiches. i had the jumbo lump crabcake sandwhich (via their menu on the website...\"crab cake on a brioche bun with arugula, tomato and crispy onion strings and mustard mayonnaise. served with parmesan chips\") and my mom had the seared salmon sandwhich (which is not listed on the menu online for some odd reason). those were the 2 best damn sandwhiches i've ever had!!!! omgggg!! sooo yummyyyy!!! i think it's funny that we were at an italian restaurant and didn't have pasta but i am so glad at our choices because the food was soooo delicious!\n\nwe were so stuffed from our soup and salad that we each only ate half of our sandwhiches and went back to our hotel room with our leftovers, happily! lol! we were very happy with our lunch from maggiano's and will be making it a regular stop on future visits to vegas.\n\nalthough i am in the bay and heard there's a maggiano's down in san jose, i rarely head down to the south bay so i doubt i'll be visiting that one. i highly suggest the location in las vegas!! \n\np.s. excellent service as well! oh yeah, and it was a lovely day so we opted to dine outside and it was very nice! the weather was perfect!", 
            "i love love love maggiano's. i've been to three of their locations, and most recently the las vegas one again.\n\nmy bf and i arrived around 8 on a saturday night, and thankfully only waited about 15 minutes to be seated. i had been starving myself since the morning in anticipation of this meal. we took the first available, which was outside and i wouldn't recommend it. it's not maggiano's fault, but there was an ipod commercial running on a continuous loop on one of the outdoor televisions at the mall. even with the ambient noise, and the restaurant's own music, by the time we were done with dinner, i was ready to jab a fork in both of my ears. that being said, i still had a great dinner! \n\ni've never been disappointed with the food nor service, and this time was no different. our waiter was very nice and attentive and helped us pick out a really good bottle of wine.  we started with the fried mozzarella with marinara sauce... yummm.  the maggiano salad has a great light flavored dressing and little bits of prosciutto in it.... so tasty! and for the main course we shared my favorite dish on the face of this planet, the chicken and <mark>Chicken & Spinach Manicotti</mark>. words just cannot do this dish justice, suffice it to say it's freakin fabulous. \n\ni somehow mustered the courage to order desert, even though my stomach was filled to the max. but i just absolutely love their cheesecake. i am not a big fan of cheesecake, but maggiano's makes theirs with mostly marscapone cheese and it is just wonderful! \n\nso if you are in vegas and looking for some overly generous portioned great food i highly recommend maggianos!",

            "for my mother-in-law's birthday last weekend, my husband planned a big surprise birthday party for her at maggiano's, which is an old favorite haunt of his.\n\nmaggiano's exterior is nothing spectacular considering they're stuck on the second floor of a mall, but once you step out of the elevator you're transported.  giant crystal chandeliers line the majestic hallways as you pass through the entryway and multiple private dining areas lined with dark wood.  the bar area is dark paneled, well-staffed, and tucked far in the busy back / main dining room.  it was packed when we arrived, but we found seats and ordered cocktails quite easily (though we heard there was a one-hour wait for tables for those without reservations).\n\nwhen our table for 10 was ready we headed over to a corner lot where our group gathered.  it wasn't particularly easy to navigate the space in which they'd placed our party, as they've crammed as many tables in the room as they can and we were situated up against six booths. however, the waiters were quite patient practicing a constant ballet / battle with us while we hugged one another and took photographs (or they just went around the other way).\n\nthe ambiance inside maggiano's was so dark, warm, and cozy that i was expecting more from the food.  the calamari that someone ordered as an appetizer was boring, bland, and uninspired.  the <mark>Spinach Salad</mark> i ordered was giant and tasty; however, i wished i'd stopped there.  unfortunately my huge vat of gnocci was equally bland and mediocre, and the bread on the tables was stale/hard.  it was so loud and busy in the restaurant (and i was drunk, which i'll get to in a minute) that i didn't even think to ask to try gt's entree (linguini and clams in red sauce) which he said was a good thing, because he hated it (and said that the food was much better a few years ago).\n\nthe adorable accordian player was a wonderful touch; he played some of our requests at one end of the table (although it was so loud in the restaurant that those on the other end couldn't hear).  throughout our meal i was shocked that i wasn't drinking my wine; every time i turned to look at my glass i could swear it looked as if i hadn't touched it.\n\nturns out that the stealth waiters were just constantly topping it off, which unfortunately resulted in a disequilibrium in the brain of yours truly, and my evening ended with me trying to get my mother in law to take us to a strip club and arguing with gt's uncle (who'd flown in from oahu for the occasion) about whether or not boys are hornier than girls.  bad, self, bad!  perhaps a waiter asking a gal every now and again if she'd like more wine would help a hypothetically drunk girl manage her evening in a slightly more classy manner.\n\nmy main gripe, however, was that gt and i had made cupcakes for dessert that spelled out \"oh, shit, she's 70!\" when all lined up properly.  but we brought them in our cupcake pan and the waiter brought them out in the same pan we'd brought them in (though we'd asked that they be put on a large plate).  as a result, they read \"ohsh   itsh  es70!\"  also, although the kind/patient waiter did light the candles for us, i got the impression that the staff just wrote us off at the end, or perhaps someone in the back was a little ticked off with us for bringing our own dessert.  regardless of the reason, i thought it very odd that they didn't bring us plates or forks with dessert - we had to hunch over the table and eat cupcakes over the tiny cupcake wrappers, carefully trying not to spill crumbs everywhere, which is not so easy to do when you're drunk on maggiono's bottomless glass of wine.",

            "yum yum yum pretty much sums up my maggiano's experience. i went for a wedding reception which allowed me to sample many appetizers and entrees. i was not disappointed in any of them. the highlights were the breaded zucchini which was so crunchy and flavorful. there was a <mark>Spinach Salad</mark> that tasted like a party in my mouth, with bits of creamy cheese and pancetta bits. the entrees were equally gratifying, my faves were the salmon on a bed of spinach (cooked to absolute perfection) and the raviolis in a pesto cream sauce. the <mark><mark><mark>Chicken Parmesan</mark></mark></mark> was also a front runner, the chicken breasts were pounded so thin, yet still juicy and moist. \n\ni will definitely venture back to this gem in the mall!!!",

            "2 1/2 more like it. \nthey put lots of food on the plates, it's just that it's really nothing too special. the best of the lot we tried were the mussels, and the side <mark>Spinach Salad</mark> was okay as well. \nas for the veal picata, or the <mark>Jumbo Lump Crab Cakes</mark>...would  pass on them. \nwines in the limited selection are reasonably priced. \nalong with the large portions, prices are reasonable.. and that keeps the place packed with patrons... reservations are recommended.",

            "i really enjoy the food here. i ordered to take out because i didn't wanna eat by myself and look all weird at an upscale restaurant...that's just no.\n\nservice on the take out was quick simple and easy, by the time i got to the cashier, the man was already there, it was a big guy and had a healthy complexion. i was going to receive change but i told the guy to keep it since he was there ready for me.\n\nitalian food vs. italian food; way better than olive gardens old bland food (i'll check them out again though since they did try to change for the better), 5 times better! i only got one dish just to try and check the food out.\n\n\n*chicken & <mark>Chicken & Spinach Manicotti</mark>, full of flavor! chicken had a natural chicken flavor with slight seasoning, the spinach wasn't overbearing and just helped compliment the dish, texture had a slight crisp and softness to it which had a really fine balance, it was superb in my opinion. not too salty or dry. the ricotta cheese and alfredo sauce blends in perfectly, although the ricotta was just a tad on the stronger side.\n\ni'll definitely be coming back.", 
            "i would give this place 5 stars..but our waiter..every time he poured me water, he spilled it. only mine. -__- \n\nfirst time was a big ass spill..next one went on my bread..third one went on my meal. come on maaayynn. \n\nbut the food was bomb diggity!\n\nwent to maggiano's for me, and 2 other friend's birthday dinner with everyone! they have a nice little family meal which is a ridiculous amount of food. but it's all you can eat. doesn't really explain much,  but if you have a big group..i would suggest that you get that. (although we didn't order it..lol) \n\nservice was pretty good. we got some toasty warm bread (yum) and their butter is so  yums!\n\ni ended up ordering the chicken & <mark>Chicken & Spinach Manicotti</mark>. sooo creamy..so deliiicious! comes in 3 decent sized pieces, and i just wanted to savor every bite. \n\nit's really quiet in there..none of the other customers talk, so for the most part, my friends and i were the entertainment of the night. \n\nwe were seated in the back right corner, so we are able to see the other hotels and what not. all of a sudden, we see 4 cop cars chasing this white car, and it stopped right in front of our view. all of us got up and it was so intense!!!  the police ripped the driver out of the car and shoved him to the ground. ohmygah. that was good stuff. \n\nalso, i can't fail to mention..we all got to go boxes and bags..and we took some pictures outside. this was towards the hotels, so away from maggiano's. my friend left her bag near a trashcan and left her coach wristlet inside. we were all facing away..when we were done with the picture, she asked where her bag was. we had no idea.. i said to not worry, cause it's just her food..but none of us knew her credit card, id, and other important things were in it. \n\nanyone could've taken it! luckily. one of our friends saw 2 homeless men downstairs carrying a maggiano's bag, and he looked inside the bag and pulled out the food and coach wristlet! \n\nfriend's bf sprinted down the stairs and charged for the guy and said, \"gimme that bag!\" & the homeless guy was pissed, but gave it back. if it wasn't for our one friend who saw him, we would've never found it. \n\njust wanted to share the crazy experiences from maggiano's :] \n\nbut i would definitely suggest this place! it's really good. tried all of my friend's food..and perfecto!", 
            "took a recent trip to vegas and after walking around starving me and my bf decided to try out maggiano's.  the ambiance is beautiful with rich furnishings and amazing views of the strip. bread is brought to the table with butter, but there is also olive oil on the table if you prefer to dip with that. we started with an appetizer of <mark>Tomato Caprese</mark> that was very good, next we shared the smaller version of the <mark>Spinach Salad</mark> that was amazing (bacon, pine nuts, super yummy dressing etc), and finally we split a plate of the <mark><mark><mark>Chicken Parmesan</mark></mark></mark> that was a large portion, so big in fact we ended up taking the rest to go in a box. in total, those 3 dishes 1 water and 1 coke was $37 which i thought was very reasonable. the sever was friendly, prompt and attentive. there was also a man with a guitar that would sing you a song at the time if you would like. overall i liked the mood of the restaurant, the romantic feel, delicious food and wonderful service. no complaints.", 
            "this is my fourth visit and the food and service seem pretty much consistent.  ordered the margherita pizza for an appetizer and for my main course i had the spinach and <mark>Chicken & Spinach Manicotti</mark>.  fortunately, i also got to try the linguine di mare and the <mark><mark><mark>Chicken Parmesan</mark></mark></mark> that my party ordered.  they were all delicious but the manicotti has to be my favorite.  \n\nthis is a very inexpensive restaurant with generous portions, so it's definitely worth the try after a long day of shopping.  be sure to call in advance otherwise you'd be waiting as long as an hour and a half to be seated.  ask for a table next to the window with view of lvblvd, not one of the best, but still a pretty sight for you out of towners.", 
            "3 1/2 - 4 ****\nlocated in the fashion show mall, tons of parking and glass windows to enjoy the scenery.  \nreservations highly recommended as it can get very busy. \n\ni've eaten here several times and for some reason i keep coming back.  it must be the large portions and great service. \n\nfood: \n<mark>Spinach Salad</mark>- tender leaf spinach tossed with diced red peppers, roasted red onions and gorgonzola cheese, yummy applewood smoked bacon, toasted pine nuts and apple cider vinaigrette. \n<mark>Tomato Caprese</mark>-sliced tomatoes topped with fresh mozzarella and basil, drizzled with a balsamic glaze and crispy calamari. \n\ndinner: \nlobster carbonara- it  was dry so i would never order it again. \n<mark>Mom's Lasagna</mark> with meat sauce\nbeef tenderloin medallions\n\nit' really not a bad place despite of what others has said.   to me it's reasonably priced, service was great and i love the complimentary bread.", 
            "made a reservation here and was seated with no problem; but then again there was no wait. service was pretty good, my girlfriend and i came as a short last dinner before heading back to reality. i would give our server a solid b+/a- considering menu explanation, time it took to get his attention, he remembered my to-go order, and we spent less than an hour there from being sat to exiting.\n\nwe had:\n-side <mark>Spinach Salad</mark> with gorgonzola cheese: pretty yummy, i am a fan of gorgonzola but i think huge chunks were a little much, even for me. dressing was a little heavy.\n-linguine & clam: good broth in the pasta, healthy amount of clams\n-peppercorn steak w/ the maggiano's sauce which was carmelized onion and such: so yummy; a bit salty so you have to eat it with the mashed potatoes but the potatoes had melted cheese and it was so so good.\n\ndo want to mention that this restaurant did not have the classic \"buy one take one home\" menu options that are available at a lot of other chains, though.", 
            "ma-ma-ma-maggiano's i sure love you!  why? because you make my tummy happy!\n\ni have been going to maggiano's on and off since the las vegas location opened.  i had never heard of the chain before because i am not really an italian food fan and tend not to notice those restaurants around town.  i went here for the first time for a friend's birthday dinner a while back and have been hooked ever since!  \n\nbefore maggiano's, i was a pasta hater.  i know, i know, i am a weirdo, but i just wasn't into any pasta.  i would only eat it if i had to, but it was never a first, second, or third choice for me.  that was until i had the chicken and <mark>Chicken & Spinach Manicotti</mark>.  this is in my top 10 dishes ever.  that very night after eating this dish, i kid you not, i had a dream about it.  yes, when i have a great meal, i will dream about it.  i still get this dish 99% of the time.  every time i get it, it makes my whole day.  if i could get away with it in public, i would totally lick the plate to get all of the sauce off because i don't want to waste one drop of that awesome alfredo goodness.  when i do try a different dish, i often feel like i am having a food affair and cheating on my precious manicotti yes, i love it that much.\n\ni have tried a few other dishes (while having a food affair) and they have all been good.  i really have enjoyed the chicken saltimbocca, eggplant parm, lasagna, and the beef tenderloin medallions.  i don't think i have ever heard anyone i was with not like one of their dishes.  yummy yum.\n\nthe kid's menu is also fantastic as well.  the food is awesome adult quality except it is just a little more friendly to a kid palates.  they have all sorts of pasta options, chicken fingers, and pizza.  the kid's chicken fingers are ridiculously tasty because yes, i steal my kid's food on occasion.  every kid's meal is $5.95 for a big entree, dessert, and a drink.  this is a better deal than a lot of restaurants that serve kid's mediocre food.  i love a good deal!\n\none good tip i have for you is to make a reservation ahead of time.  this particular location always seems to be busy, no matter what time of day.  they are on opentable.com, so making a reservation is super easy 24/7.  \n\nif you have never been to a maggiano's, you should give it a try.  and of course my recommendation would be the chicken and <mark>Chicken & Spinach Manicotti</mark>!", 
            "maggianos is a family atmosphere restaurant, with a good location, great food and excellent service.\nif you're looking for that restaurant where you want to fell comfortable with the whole family this is it, i come here every time i'm visiting vegas with my four years old daughter (of course she knows how to behave in a restaurant). \nthe location is perfect, specially if you're planning to do some shopping since is located right there at the fashion show mall and if you're  lucky you might get a table with a nice view of the wynn and encore casinos across the strip.\nthe food is great,  some of my favorites entrees are the lobster carbonara, the rigatoni d and the <mark>Chicken & Spinach Manicotti</mark>, all good and  the portion of food is more than enough.\nthe excellent service is based on my last visit. i made a 7:15pm reservation but we arrived about 20 minutes earlier (vegas traffic unpredictable). i asked them if we could be  seated and in less than five minutes we were already enjoying ourselves. nestor was the name of the waiter, he was there when needed with suggestions of appetizers, wine and desserts. simply great service!!"

            "my buddies and i decided to eat here while all of us suffered from hangovers.  the delicious food here will restore your apetite from whatever came back out from the previous night.  the family style is a great way to enjoy the meal.  they provide a lot of food for their prices.\n\nwe started with the potato soup which relly jump started my apetite.  it's rich, creamy, and flavorful.  next up was the beef braciole.  this dish was quite interesting.  the texture was weird yet it was edible (may have been my hangover dulling my senses).  i can't quite remember the name of the next dish, but it was a spicy spaghetti and meat balls, i believe.  the spiciness brought back all my senses and pretty much kicked me out of my intoxicated state.  you can never go wrong with spaghetti and <mark>Meatball</mark>.  we also had the rigatoni \"d\".  the chicken was tender and the protein gave me energy for more partying.  \n\nthey gave us enough food to take back to the hotel and have for dinner.  if you love italian food and pastas, this place would be a place to stop by.", 
            "two stars for the low quality of food.\n\nmy friends and i decided to spend our last dinner in vegas at maggianos. it was a short walk from our hotel and we wanted some real food after nights of bingeing on whatever we can get our hands on after the clubs. it is definitely on the expensive side where a half order of pasta will be around 11-17 bucks while a full order will cost you 20+. \n\nthey do encourage family style for tables of 4+, but i think the cheapest family style was still around 20 a person. \n\nout of the four of us we ordered: spaggetti with <mark>Meatball</mark>, lobster alfredo, fettucini alfredo and linguine with clams. all of the dishes were tasteless. i had to drown my linguine with claims with half the bottle of salt  and all my friends did too. maybe the chef forgot about the salt??  idk, although the pasta were tasteless, the seafood was fresh and the bread was pretty good too. \n\nmeh, i've experienced better is the perfect description for this place.",

            "as i was shopping at fashion show mall i noticed this italian restaurant and made a mental note to check it out on yelp later for a possible dinner option.\n\naccording to yelp this place was worth trying. i used the open table feature to make a reservation (not knowing if it was really needed or not, but i figured why not). i'm glad i did. when we made it in to the restaurant it was packed and there was a wait. we were seated immediately. \n\nwe were seated in a comfortable booth seat, and served water immediately and given some explanation of the menu. this place had a good variety of italian food from pastas, to chicken, beef and seafood selections. i liked that they had a family style option as well. at first glance i would say this place looks pricey specially since your entr\\u00e9e comes with just your entr\\u00e9e no salad or soup like olive garden. \n\nwe ordered a side salad to share that was $4.95 but it was the perfect size for two specially since we were stuffing our faces with the yummy french bread served with olive oil and vinegar (oh so yummy, and dangerous!). \n\nour plates took over 30 minutes to arrive, if it was not for the bread and salad i would have been more upset. \n\ni ordered <mark>Mom's Lasagna</mark> made with <mark>Meatball</mark> and sausage with your choice of marinara or meat sauce. i choose marinara since so much meat came with the dish already. my plate arrived and what do you know, it probably could have served four people, fairly large portions. i ate all of it, in phases but i ate it all. it was exquisite. perfect layering, the lasagna stayed together (i hate when you cut into lasagna and the layers fall apart). \n\nmy favorite part was being serenaded by a duo (violin and guitar) to one of my wedding songs (it's impossible). if it weren't for the wynn in the background i could almost say i was in italy.\n\ni don't have any complaints about this place. our total bill came to $37.50: two entrees, one side salad and one beverage. we came on a monday night and it was busy so definitely try and make reservations if you can.", 
            "it's a national chain, so if you've been to one you've been to them all. but, the good thing about higher-end chain restaurants is that they're consistent. and, in the case of maggiano's, they're consistently good, for the most part, and a good value.\n\nmy wife had a gift card to their family of restaurants, which included chili's and macaroni grill. naturally, we chose the best of the lot -- maggiano's. located in fashion show mall, it's a pain to find the entrance. walking through the mall, you have to actually walk outside of the mall towards the strip and head to the second level via the outdoor escalators to find the main entrance.\n\nthis was a family outing for us -- our three year old son in tow -- so we were happy to be seated at a booth. they've got a kid's menu with the usual stuff (pizza, chicken fingers, mac-n-cheese, etc). for $5.95 kids get an entree, beverage, and a dessert (lemon cookies or vanilla ice cream). my kid opted for the pizza. it's a long, rectangular, crispy cheese flatbread pizza cut into triangles. tasty and large enough for two kids to share.\n\nthe lasagna was the best item of the night. a huge brick shape filled with crumbled <mark>Meatball</mark> and <mark>Gnocchi & Italian Sausage</mark> and covered in meat sauce. the gnocchi also came in a large portion, good enough for two people. while it was a little too dense, it was a passable version of the dish that came with spicy <mark>Gnocchi & Italian Sausage</mark> and a creamy (oversauced) vodka sauce.\n\nthey have small dessert options for $2.95. the chocolate cake was decent. a little too cold and firm, but it hit the spot. we also opted for the lemoncello pie ($7) -- essentially a circular key lime pie with cherries garnishing the plate and topped with whipped cream and almond slivers.\n\nwhile not the best italian food in the city, maggiano's does make for a good family restaurant at a decent price, considering its location.\n\n3.5 stars",

(they don't they are 100% beef)\n\nup to this point was was frustrated that everything seemed disorganized, sloppy and chaotic. it took 20 minutes to get bread on the table.\n\n------the reason for 1 star------\n\nwe were given a table outside on the patio and i was in the back corner of the table. as i was sitting at the table i scooted my chair over and back about 5\" it turns out there was a hole about 2-3\" deep that used to have a hand rail post sticking out of it but was removed to make more room.. i fell back in my chair and some how caught myself mid fall to avoid slamming my head into the cement wall behind me. i pop up and my dad said the dishwasher behind me had a look like i almost died and the server next to me said when i was in the hole pulling my chair back out. \"oh yeah there is a hole there\" wtf kind of observation is that. if you know about a preexisting hazard fix it!!!\n\nlong story short i pulled something my back and was instantly hurting. we contacted the manager who seemed on top of offered to take me to the hospital and call him if i had any problems.  i wasn't about to have my last night in vegas be ruined by that. for my pain and all this we got 25% taken off the bill. and i left hurting and in pain.\n\n\ni think this was a weak compensation for the pain the and hazard, have my mom or dad been sitting here they physically couldn't have caught there balance as fast and would have been seriously hurt.",

            "this was a great place to eat on the strip.  we didn't have reservations, but we took seats in the bar area. other reviews suggested reservations, so if you have a large group or need to make a show, make reservations.  i had the <mark>Creamy Tomato Basil</mark> soup and <mark>Chopped Salad</mark>. both were wonderful.  my husband had the spaghetti and <mark>Meatball</mark>. my children had the cheese ravioli's and the penne pasta. they also offer family style meals if you prefer that.  the waitress was very friendly and service was great.  i would recommend this to anyone going to vegas. so much of the food we ate was overpriced and mediocre. this was reasonably priced and delicious.", 
            "as far as chain restaurants go, this is one of my favorites. this particular location is awesome too, and i suspect because of it's primo las vegas strip location, they are all trained to wow you with their service.\n\ni took the wife and kid here, and i was almost ashamed to do so because of the white cloth tables. this location seemed just a tad upper class, but alas we were hungry wolfpack. and i spotted a smattering of kids here so i didn't feel as bad later.\n\nordered the bruschetta, <mark>Shrimp Scampi</mark>, and classic spaghetti <mark>Meatball</mark>. all dishes were excellent,  esp the scampi. no complaints here. the bruschetta was super tasty, the tomatoes and olive oil made me feel like i was in tuscany. haha. too much? yeah.\n\nservice was amazing. i didn't get the guys name but it was perfect. friendly, but not fake, attentive, but not pyscho. deserving of his 25% tip...only in vegas right?\n\nanyway, if you got an urge for italian but don't want snotty service at a michelen joint, come here.", 
            "this place was great. my dad loves a good spaghetti and <mark>Meatball</mark>, it's his go to favorite meal.  and me myself, i love <mark><mark><mark>Chicken Parmesan</mark></mark></mark>. we went here  when we were visiting my dad in the fall. we had a great, amazing view of the strip, and it was right as the sun going down... perfect.\n\nwe all had great food, and great service. i know it's a chain but it was still good to enjoy it and the environment was great.\n\nhopefully, next trip out to vegas to visit me dad, we can stop again.", 
            "i have always been a fan of maggiano's. i first went to one of their establishments over 10 years ago in chicago and have gone to that one probably ten times since. when they opened one in las vegas i was happy to go there as well and have frequented it many times since then. \n\nmaggiano's is one of those rare restaurants that overfeeds you meaning they serve huge servings which is very hard to usually finish unless you're super hungry. \n\non our most recent visit we got spaghetti and <mark>Meatball</mark>, <mark>Shrimp Scampi</mark>, chicken piccata, sauteed spinach, and mashed potatoes. as usual my family had a hard time devouring all the food. my niece was overwhelmed by the huge serving of shrip scampi as was my son with the spaghetti. i was just able to finish off my dish of chicken piccata. \n\nneedless to say that we are fans of maggiano's and it is always on our list of restaurants to visit when in vegas.", 
            "when it comes to italian this place is my favorite in vegas ! great place to take a date or your whole family, please be smart and make reservations because with quality food like this there will be many people there. lets talk about some of my favorite things to order.\n\nright from the start the warm bread basket is fantastic please enjoy the top notch virgin olive oil and the best balsamic vinegar i have ever had! \nsome of my favorite appetizer are bruschetta, a simple but very tasty plate, the <mark>Chopped Salad</mark> or any of their salads are great and large enough to share and though i personally am not a fan of calamari my grandma and fathers side of the family who are 100% sicilian i may add rave about it and order it every time we go! \nas for main course you can't go wrong with any of their pasta dishes which i can almost guarantee you will have some left over to take home! my favorite, though it is another simple classic dish, is the spaghetti and <mark>Meatball</mark> i absolutely love it! the chicken parm is fantastic as well! in all honesty their are more great dishes here than i can name in this review!\nnow for desert, if you were able to save room go for it or you can be like me and get a piece of tripple layer chocolate cake to go, it is extremely rich and very well made the cheesecake is very good as well! \n\ni strongly reccomend this restaurant and as i said in the beggining it is one of the better places to take a date especially if you want to impress, once again please make reservations for less wait time but if there is a little wait they have a great little bar area you can grab a few cocktails relax and socialize! also as i said dont limit this place to only dates its great for the whole family with large portions attentive wait staff and a lot of class ! 5 stars and truley a gem! \nenjoy :)", 
            "this place was absolutely amazing! out waiters name was dave. he treated us so well. answered all of our questions and gave us amazing recommendations. we ate the stuffed shells, spaghetti and <mark>Meatball</mark>, and lasagna and it was spectacular! the food came out so fast, and we were starving. i will definitely be back to this place very soon!!", 
            "my friends & i had a very pleasant dining experience here when they rented out one of the private rooms at maggiano's as the lunch reception for their 10-year wedding vow renewal. we had 3 tables that seated about 10-12 people. there was plenty of room for a display table as well. and there was also an adjacent balcony with a view of the strip & encore. they had a specially tailored menu with their names on it as well as at the door upon entering the room (we had to correct them on the spelling when we arrived & they corrected it before the families arrived). overall the service and the experience was a positive one. i think it's safe to say the guests & celebrants enjoyed their time at maggiano's. i'd advise you to valet outside because the elevator by valet takes you right up to restaurant. my friend that lives in town gave me that nugget of information. so convenient...\n\nnow on to the menu: first course was <mark>Stuffed Mushrooms</mark>, calamari & <mark>Italian Tossed Salad</mark>. the <mark>Stuffed Mushrooms</mark> were good. they were big mushrooms and it was stuffed with spinach and bread crumbs. they were served in a white wine sauce. you cant go wrong with calamari and their version didn't disappoint. fresh tasting pieces of breaded squid accompanied with marinara sauce for dipping. just squeeze some lemon over the calamari and you're golden. the <mark>Italian Tossed Salad</mark> was surprisingly delicious. salad had arugula, lettuce, pepperoncinis & croutons in italian dressing. good appetizers. i enjoyed every single one of them. \n\nsecond course consisted of meat lasagna, rustic chicken & shrimp and chicken marsala. i loved the meat lasagna. but really, what's not to love? it's lasagna! and it was classically delicious. they don't call it \"mom's meat lasagna with meat sauce\" for nothing. crumbled <mark>Meatball</mark> & sausage with ricotta cheese. boom! i didnt have the rustic chicken & shrimp but my friend's seemed to like it. the chicken marsala was so very good. white meat chicken that was so moist and tasty. it was the perfect chicken dish. i loved it the most... and that's saying a lot given that lasagna was on the menu. order it. trust me.\n\nfor dessert, we had 2 offerings. chocolate zucotto cake & nonna's toasted pound cake. all i had was the toasted pound cake & that's all i needed. it was so damn good. crispy edges on the pound cake topped with a scoop of vanilla bean ice cream, slivers of chocolate and served along side caramelized bananas. game over. i dont have to tell you how good it was. you already know. \n\nyou're welcome...", 
            "my initial thought was that this feels like a chain restaurant (without realizing it was).  the young low quality waitstaff, the generic menu and the robotic operationally efficient way the place was run all made me think that.\n\nthe couple in front of us requested and was granted a booth.  we then ask for a booth and are told there are no booths available.  we look around and there are tons of booths available both on the outskirts of the floor layout and right in the middle.  we ask if those were reserved and the host says no, there is only one table open and no booths open and he says that is due to lack of waitstaff.  wtf.  within minutes of us sitting at a table the next couple is sat at a booth...wtf?!?  this pisses off my buddy who says something negative and storms off to talk to the manager.  a random waitress hears this and ask if there is a problem.  i tell her the issue and her reply is essentially \"we have lots of booths available for you to sit\". long story short the manager moves us to the booth we figured they would seat us at in the first place.\n\nour waiter at the first table was terrible.  i'd expect him at an applebees in some podunk town of 15,000 people..not a supposed nice restaurant on the strip.  his unkept hair and facial hair that more closely resembled pubic hair made him look like he was homeless.  he talked like a \"surfer duuuude.\"  this isn't taco bell buddy.  he also didn't seem to know what he was doing.  he would just ask if we know what we want and then would disappear for a long time.  he brought my water without the lemons i requested.  when he asked if we needed anything else i said lemons and he's like \"sure dude\"seemingly oblivious to the fact that he had previously told us he would bring some.\n\nour waiter at our 2nd table was much more experienced.  he gave us spiels about the menu items.  he was also far more attentive.  one funny thing i heard him say quite loudly to the other waiter that most would have taken offense to was that the first waiter \"won the lottery\" which was an obvious reference to us not spending much money.  it should be noted that we ordered drinks/desert later which he didn't realize when he made the comment.\n\nto me the menu was boring and bland.  it should be noted i don't eat seafood.  there was nothing that jumped out at me and told me it wanted me to eat it so i just made the oh so generic order of spaghetti and <mark>Meatball</mark> with meat sauce.  it was tasty.  don't expect anything special from it.  free bread before the meal always gets my approval and it was good.  i also ordered the tiramisu which was awesome.  definitely recommend that.\n\nmy buddy was told each waiter only has 4 tables which i can't fathom especially with as poor service as the original waiter delivered.  i assumed they were having service issues because youtube personality \"the trooper\" recently quit working there.  the host was clueless and didn't even know who the trooper was.  whattttuuuup trooper, it's the yelp reviewer letting you know that maggianos has already gone downhill since you left.", 
            "this place was great!  great food, cocktails, ambience, and view of all the city lights at night.  it's located on the 2nd floor of the fashion mall across from trump towers.  i had one of their specials that was basically a chicken dish of chicken kabob-type pieces with chicken <mark>Meatball</mark> and chopped peppers, onions, and quartered potatoes. the hubs had <mark><mark><mark>Chicken Parmesan</mark></mark></mark> that came with a side of spaghetti.  everything is a la carte so we also ordered dinner salads.  great mojitos & vodka martinis. the buttered cake with marscapone cream and scoop of ice cream was ah-mazing.  we rolled out of their we were so full.  the place was hopping even at 8:30 pm."

            "i'm surprised this place has four stars, which i think is a little high if you're judging based on taste, but value for your money, this is definitely good value.\n\ni came here a couple nights ago with a very large group (about 14?). we showed up without notice, and they were still able to get a table for us in about half an hour or so. the table ordered off the family style menu where you can only pick two of each course, but can have as much of those courses as you want until you're ready for the next one. we ordered calamari, <mark>Caesar Salad</mark>, another type of salad (i think it was the maggiano's), tomato with mozarella, <mark><mark><mark>Chicken Parmesan</mark></mark></mark>, lasagna, spaghetti with marinara sauce, salmon, tiramisu, and cheesecake. the salads were decent - crisp, and tangy. the mozarella that came with the tomato was not very smooth and a little too 'pizza mozarella' tasting for me. the spaghetti with marinara sauce was my personal favorite, along with some of the other people at the table. it was light, and the spaghetti was cooked to just the right tenderness. the lasagna was very salty and the meat chunky in an unpleasant, crumbly way. it wasn't chewy, cheesy, and meshing with the lasagna layers. \n\nthe cheesecake was really delicious, came with fresh strawberries and whipped cream. mm!\n\nthe service was a little slow and sometimes unmindful of us, but it was fairly busy in the restaurant, so i can understand.\n\ni'd come here for a decent large group setting with fairly cheap eats, but i wouldn't come here for a date or a small intimate group meal.",

            "we went for dinner and i made reservations on opentable which is super easy. we arrived and were seated within a couple minutes. the waiter came to the table and we told him that my wife has a gluten allergy and he said that would not be a problem and took our drink order and said he would be back to get our food order. when he came back he had the chef who ask my wife what she wanted and said he could make pretty much anything she wanted and she decided on the <mark><mark><mark>Chicken Parmesan</mark></mark></mark> which she loved. my 11 year old got the mama's lasagna & my 13 year old got the <mark>Fettuccine Alfredo</mark> and they both thought it was epic. i enjoyed my veal parmesan and instead of the spaghetti i asked for the <mark>Fettuccine Alfredo</mark> and they said no problem. i have to say the food was good but the service was great. my wife got the creme br\\u00fbl\\u00e9e for desert which she always enjoys. it has become a must visit when we go to vegas.", 
            "went on dinner date on 4/14, made reservations greeter didnt even acknowledge that we arrived. hostess saw that we were uncomfortable as she sat the table. too many tables and one restaurant.i thought to myself if were with our other table next to us.anyways. .. our server stephanie was great very knowledgeable on the menu offered appetizers(bruschetta)appetizer was out b4 bar drinks! asked for chilled martini's .actually came out chilled! food  was delicious!!! (chicken piccata and <mark><mark><mark>Chicken Parmesan</mark></mark></mark>).stefanie offered us tiramisu as dessert was delightful! thank u stefanie for great service!", 
            "i've actually been to maggiano's a few times and when i did it was amazing!  the food, the atmosphere, the service was phenomenal!  however, this review will be on my recent visit, just a couple days ago.\n\nme and my boyfriend decided to go for lunch here to celebrate on him getting a potential new job.  in the beginning, everything was fine.  we ordered our appetizers and... that was it?  he didn't ask if we'd like an entree after taking down our appetizers.  so, we waited for our server to come back and ask if we'd like to order an entree.  after he gave us our appetizer and even finished it, all we saw  him do was helping every other customers but us.  did he have something against us because we \"look\" 16 years old and can't afford an entree???  after about 20-30 minutes of waiting, we asked another server to ask him if he can take down our entree we've been waiting for.  he comes over and he goes, \"okay go ahead.\"  he didn't apologize for making us wait.  really??  wow.  i'm appalled by his performance.  and after we got our entree, he only came over to us twice, third time being check, and we never saw him again.\n\nthe saving grace to our experience was the food.  our appetizers were the <mark>Crispy Zucchini Fritt</mark> and <mark>Stuffed Mushrooms</mark>.  i loved how crunchy the zucchini was and the soupy base for the mushroom was great!  our entrees were the rigatoni d and <mark><mark><mark>Chicken Parmesan</mark></mark></mark>.  he enjoyed his parmesan very much and the rigatoni was very fulfilling and the cream sauce complimented the whole dish so well!  the little mushrooms in it was too cute to eat!\n\nwe're always going to come back here.  just not have that older server again.", 
            "we thoroughly enjoyed our meal here. we were able to get a seat quickly. \n\nbread service was my favorite part. balsamic vinegar in olive oil to dip the bread. yummy!!!  \n\ni had the <mark>Fettuccine Alfredo</mark> while my husband had <mark><mark><mark>Chicken Parmesan</mark></mark></mark>. huge portions that we had wrapped up for later. our daughter inhaled her ravioli. included in her kid's meal was ice cream. instead of shouting out about the ice cream in front of our daughter our fabulous server asked my husband discreetly if it was ok for her to have it. loved that!!!!!! \n\nprice was decent. food was terrific. service was fabulous. definitely recommend.", 
            "thank you maggiano's  for making my moms birthday dinner special ! the manager jesse was friendly , helpful and came to our table personally to make sure we were okay . our waiter nick was  professional and knowledgeable about the menu and what to suggest , an absolute delight ! we got the <mark>Calamari Fritt</mark> , <mark><mark><mark>Chicken Parmesan</mark></mark></mark> , veal marsala , <mark>Chopped Salad</mark> with chicken  and the nonna's pound cake  for dessert !  dinner was delicious and the service was superb !", 
            "we really like this chain. good quality food, fair pricing, large portions, nice decor and excellent service. the family style is great for large parties, everyone gets to share. we ate here tonight for our anniversary. our server, christine, was excellent. we had the <mark><mark><mark>Chicken Parmesan</mark></mark></mark> and the <mark>Creamy Tomato Basil</mark> soup, with a bottle of 14 hands merlot. everything was delicious! \nonly suggestions, please notice water glasses and bread need refilling. also, a few more options for vegetarians would be appreciated. there are usually more items to choose from when eating italian food. we always know we will have an enjoyable meal at maggianos", 
            "the food was excellent i ordered the lunch lasagna my wife ordered the lunch <mark><mark><mark>Chicken Parmesan</mark></mark></mark>. when we received our food we were amazed at the lunch portions and the extra side order of spaghetti. the food was amazing. the atmosphere in side is nice but the view from outside is lovely.", 
            "this place was great!  great food, cocktails, ambience, and view of all the city lights at night.  it's located on the 2nd floor of the fashion mall across from trump towers.  i had one of their specials that was basically a chicken dish of chicken kabob-type pieces with chicken <mark>Meatball</mark> and chopped peppers, onions, and quartered potatoes. the hubs had <mark><mark><mark>Chicken Parmesan</mark></mark></mark> that came with a side of spaghetti.  everything is a la carte so we also ordered dinner salads.  great mojitos & vodka martinis. the buttered cake with marscapone cream and scoop of ice cream was ah-mazing.  we rolled out of their we were so full.  the place was hopping even at 8:30 pm.", 
            "amazing !!!!! i took my boyfriend here for his 30th birthday and omg we were blown away ! the food was amazing ! we had the bruschetta, rigatoni d, and <mark><mark><mark>Chicken Parmesan</mark></mark></mark> ! after we ate a wonderful man came and sang happy birthday to my boyfriend with his guitar. then the restaurant manager came over and asked how our night was going then insisted that we have dessert in honor of his birthday . i didn't the name of the three desserts we were given complimentary btw but it was amazing !!!!! will defiantly be returning !", 
            "i was walking the length of the strip and that's a long way! i sort of scoped out all the lunch places, and besides fast food at a mall, this seemed like the most affordable lunch spot that might be nice. i didn't need to spend $70 on lunch at some place that was trying to make me think i was in paris or something. \n\nmaggiano's is located at the edge of the fashion show mall. we arrived for a late lunch and got a nice seat by the windows. this is more or less a sort of upscale place, not a grab lunch and go kinda place. our server seemed quite professional ... but then the up selling began. just say no and keep with what you want! the wine pours come in 2 sizes, 6 and 8 oz. wine prices are not that cheap here though. the food was quite varied on the menu. one of the great deals i spotted was the soup and half sandwich for $9.95. i selected the cesar salad and <mark><mark><mark>Chicken Parmesan</mark></mark></mark> half sandwich. my bf had the cesar salad and the italian grilled cheese & ham. the server brought over bread while we waited.which was scrumptious dipped in the olive oil and balsamic vinegar.\n\n when our food arrived, i was surprised by the portions, nice and big! the salad was a decent size and the sandwich was more than enough to eat. i was expecting a real half of a sandwich from a bread loaf cut into a little triangle ...like mom used to make you! it was served on a nice italian roll and was very good indeed. i'll say this is one of the better deals in vegas on the strip. although with the wine, tax and tip, we still ended up with a near $50 lunch for 2! oh, well, skip the wine next time! i will say though, this so far is one of my fave places i've eaten at here in vegas so far. the food is very good here, and not just a slop job cause it tourists."

            "i love love love maggiano's. i've been to three of their locations, and most recently the las vegas one again.\n\nmy bf and i arrived around 8 on a saturday night, and thankfully only waited about 15 minutes to be seated. i had been starving myself since the morning in anticipation of this meal. we took the first available, which was outside and i wouldn't recommend it. it's not maggiano's fault, but there was an ipod commercial running on a continuous loop on one of the outdoor televisions at the mall. even with the ambient noise, and the restaurant's own music, by the time we were done with dinner, i was ready to jab a fork in both of my ears. that being said, i still had a great dinner! \n\ni've never been disappointed with the food nor service, and this time was no different. our waiter was very nice and attentive and helped us pick out a really good bottle of wine.  we started with the fried mozzarella with marinara sauce... yummm.  the maggiano salad has a great light flavored dressing and little bits of prosciutto in it.... so tasty! and for the main course we shared my favorite dish on the face of this planet, the chicken and <mark>Chicken & Spinach Manicotti</mark>. words just cannot do this dish justice, suffice it to say it's freakin fabulous. \n\ni somehow mustered the courage to order desert, even though my stomach was filled to the max. but i just absolutely love their cheesecake. i am not a big fan of cheesecake, but maggiano's makes theirs with mostly marscapone cheese and it is just wonderful! \n\nso if you are in vegas and looking for some overly generous portioned great food i highly recommend maggianos!", 
            "i could definitely do without the creepy guy walking around playing the accordian, but i'll put up with it for the really yummy food and fun ambiance!\n\nwe have eaten here several times and ordered pretty much everything on the menu at one time or another and have never been disappointed.  some things are better than others, of course (try the chicken and <mark>Chicken & Spinach Manicotti</mark> -- mmmmmm), but overall the quality has always been good, the service fast, and if you can get a window seat, the view is great for people-watching!\n\noh and it sounds really plain and boring, but trust me... try the pound cake for dessert.  yum!", 
            "i really enjoy the food here. i ordered to take out because i didn't wanna eat by myself and look all weird at an upscale restaurant...that's just no.\n\nservice on the take out was quick simple and easy, by the time i got to the cashier, the man was already there, it was a big guy and had a healthy complexion. i was going to receive change but i told the guy to keep it since he was there ready for me.\n\nitalian food vs. italian food; way better than olive gardens old bland food (i'll check them out again though since they did try to change for the better), 5 times better! i only got one dish just to try and check the food out.\n\n\n*chicken & <mark>Chicken & Spinach Manicotti</mark>, full of flavor! chicken had a natural chicken flavor with slight seasoning, the spinach wasn't overbearing and just helped compliment the dish, texture had a slight crisp and softness to it which had a really fine balance, it was superb in my opinion. not too salty or dry. the ricotta cheese and alfredo sauce blends in perfectly, although the ricotta was just a tad on the stronger side.\n\ni'll definitely be coming back.", 
            "i would give this place 5 stars..but our waiter..every time he poured me water, he spilled it. only mine. -__- \n\nfirst time was a big ass spill..next one went on my bread..third one went on my meal. come on maaayynn. \n\nbut the food was bomb diggity!\n\nwent to maggiano's for me, and 2 other friend's birthday dinner with everyone! they have a nice little family meal which is a ridiculous amount of food. but it's all you can eat. doesn't really explain much,  but if you have a big group..i would suggest that you get that. (although we didn't order it..lol) \n\nservice was pretty good. we got some toasty warm bread (yum) and their butter is so  yums!\n\ni ended up ordering the chicken & <mark>Chicken & Spinach Manicotti</mark>. sooo creamy..so deliiicious! comes in 3 decent sized pieces, and i just wanted to savor every bite. \n\nit's really quiet in there..none of the other customers talk, so for the most part, my friends and i were the entertainment of the night. \n\nwe were seated in the back right corner, so we are able to see the other hotels and what not. all of a sudden, we see 4 cop cars chasing this white car, and it stopped right in front of our view. all of us got up and it was so intense!!!  the police ripped the driver out of the car and shoved him to the ground. ohmygah. that was good stuff. \n\nalso, i can't fail to mention..we all got to go boxes and bags..and we took some pictures outside. this was towards the hotels, so away from maggiano's. my friend left her bag near a trashcan and left her coach wristlet inside. we were all facing away..when we were done with the picture, she asked where her bag was. we had no idea.. i said to not worry, cause it's just her food..but none of us knew her credit card, id, and other important things were in it. \n\nanyone could've taken it! luckily. one of our friends saw 2 homeless men downstairs carrying a maggiano's bag, and he looked inside the bag and pulled out the food and coach wristlet! \n\nfriend's bf sprinted down the stairs and charged for the guy and said, \"gimme that bag!\" & the homeless guy was pissed, but gave it back. if it wasn't for our one friend who saw him, we would've never found it. \n\njust wanted to share the crazy experiences from maggiano's :] \n\nbut i would definitely suggest this place! it's really good. tried all of my friend's food..and perfecto!", 
            "this is my fourth visit and the food and service seem pretty much consistent.  ordered the margherita pizza for an appetizer and for my main course i had the spinach and <mark>Chicken & Spinach Manicotti</mark>.  fortunately, i also got to try the linguine di mare and the <mark><mark><mark>Chicken Parmesan</mark></mark></mark> that my party ordered.  they were all delicious but the manicotti has to be my favorite.  \n\nthis is a very inexpensive restaurant with generous portions, so it's definitely worth the try after a long day of shopping.  be sure to call in advance otherwise you'd be waiting as long as an hour and a half to be seated.  ask for a table next to the window with view of lvblvd, not one of the best, but still a pretty sight for you out of towners.", 
            "ma-ma-ma-maggiano's i sure love you!  why? because you make my tummy happy!\n\ni have been going to maggiano's on and off since the las vegas location opened.  i had never heard of the chain before because i am not really an italian food fan and tend not to notice those restaurants around town.  i went here for the first time for a friend's birthday dinner a while back and have been hooked ever since!  \n\nbefore maggiano's, i was a pasta hater.  i know, i know, i am a weirdo, but i just wasn't into any pasta.  i would only eat it if i had to, but it was never a first, second, or third choice for me.  that was until i had the chicken and <mark>Chicken & Spinach Manicotti</mark>.  this is in my top 10 dishes ever.  that very night after eating this dish, i kid you not, i had a dream about it.  yes, when i have a great meal, i will dream about it.  i still get this dish 99% of the time.  every time i get it, it makes my whole day.  if i could get away with it in public, i would totally lick the plate to get all of the sauce off because i don't want to waste one drop of that awesome alfredo goodness.  when i do try a different dish, i often feel like i am having a food affair and cheating on my precious manicotti yes, i love it that much.\n\ni have tried a few other dishes (while having a food affair) and they have all been good.  i really have enjoyed the chicken saltimbocca, eggplant parm, lasagna, and the beef tenderloin medallions.  i don't think i have ever heard anyone i was with not like one of their dishes.  yummy yum.\n\nthe kid's menu is also fantastic as well.  the food is awesome adult quality except it is just a little more friendly to a kid palates.  they have all sorts of pasta options, chicken fingers, and pizza.  the kid's chicken fingers are ridiculously tasty because yes, i steal my kid's food on occasion.  every kid's meal is $5.95 for a big entree, dessert, and a drink.  this is a better deal than a lot of restaurants that serve kid's mediocre food.  i love a good deal!\n\none good tip i have for you is to make a reservation ahead of time.  this particular location always seems to be busy, no matter what time of day.  they are on opentable.com, so making a reservation is super easy 24/7.  \n\nif you have never been to a maggiano's, you should give it a try.  and of course my recommendation would be the chicken and <mark>Chicken & Spinach Manicotti</mark>!", 
            "maggianos is a family atmosphere restaurant, with a good location, great food and excellent service.\nif you're looking for that restaurant where you want to fell comfortable with the whole family this is it, i come here every time i'm visiting vegas with my four years old daughter (of course she knows how to behave in a restaurant). \nthe location is perfect, specially if you're planning to do some shopping since is located right there at the fashion show mall and if you're  lucky you might get a table with a nice view of the wynn and encore casinos across the strip.\nthe food is great,  some of my favorites entrees are the lobster carbonara, the rigatoni d and the <mark>Chicken & Spinach Manicotti</mark>, all good and  the portion of food is more than enough.\nthe excellent service is based on my last visit. i made a 7:15pm reservation but we arrived about 20 minutes earlier (vegas traffic unpredictable). i asked them if we could be  seated and in less than five minutes we were already enjoying ourselves. nestor was the name of the waiter, he was there when needed with suggestions of appetizers, wine and desserts. simply great service!!"

            "it's a national chain, so if you've been to one you've been to them all. but, the good thing about higher-end chain restaurants is that they're consistent. and, in the case of maggiano's, they're consistently good, for the most part, and a good value.\n\nmy wife had a gift card to their family of restaurants, which included chili's and macaroni grill. naturally, we chose the best of the lot -- maggiano's. located in fashion show mall, it's a pain to find the entrance. walking through the mall, you have to actually walk outside of the mall towards the strip and head to the second level via the outdoor escalators to find the main entrance.\n\nthis was a family outing for us -- our three year old son in tow -- so we were happy to be seated at a booth. they've got a kid's menu with the usual stuff (pizza, chicken fingers, mac-n-cheese, etc). for $5.95 kids get an entree, beverage, and a dessert (lemon cookies or vanilla ice cream). my kid opted for the pizza. it's a long, rectangular, crispy cheese flatbread pizza cut into triangles. tasty and large enough for two kids to share.\n\nthe lasagna was the best item of the night. a huge brick shape filled with crumbled <mark>Meatball</mark> and <mark>Gnocchi & Italian Sausage</mark> and covered in meat sauce. the gnocchi also came in a large portion, good enough for two people. while it was a little too dense, it was a passable version of the dish that came with spicy <mark>Gnocchi & Italian Sausage</mark> and a creamy (oversauced) vodka sauce.\n\nthey have small dessert options for $2.95. the chocolate cake was decent. a little too cold and firm, but it hit the spot. we also opted for the lemoncello pie ($7) -- essentially a circular key lime pie with cherries garnishing the plate and topped with whipped cream and almond slivers.\n\nwhile not the best italian food in the city, maggiano's does make for a good family restaurant at a decent price, considering its location.\n\n3.5 stars", 
            "i had dinner here with three co-workers last wednesday night (1/11/2012). the ambiance was nice and the wait staff very friendly and efficient. we ordered the family style dining option and the appetizers were excellent. we have the mozzarella marinara, spinach & artichoke <mark>Mushroom Ravioli al Forno</mark>, garlic bread focaccia, and <mark>Italian Tossed Salad</mark>. for dinner we ordered gnocchi & <mark>Gnocchi & Italian Sausage</mark>, <mark>Four-Cheese Ravioli</mark>, baked rigatoni pomodoro, and braised beef ravioli. the main dishes were overly sauced and the pasta was over cooked. i could not even eat the gnocchi...it was like eating balls of paste.\n\nthis restaurant is highly rated by many on yelp so it is possible we were just there on a bad night but i will find it hard to return after my last experience. i don't think that anyone in my group was terribly impressed.", 
            "we made reservations for maggiano's through yelp...and it was so fast and easy!  i would highly recommend making reservations through yelp, if it has the option.  i believe it was linked to foursquare?? not sure though.  \n\nwe took my mom out for a late mother's day dinner.  it wasn't crowded; which was great...though it got a bit crowded after 6pm.  while, we waited for my mom to arrive we sat at the bar.  my husband got a beer and he got a little surprise!  the glass in which the bartender poured the beer had a lipstick mark.  it was gross.  he told the bartender and looked at it in shock.  he gladly switched it out.  \n\nwe went with the family style \"classic\" option which includes 2 appetizers, salads and desserts & 4 entrees.  we got the calamari and zucchini for appetizer.  the ceasar and <mark>Spinach Salad</mark>.  the chicken parm, grilled salmon, spaghetti w/ <mark>Meatball</mark> and gnocchi w/ <mark>Gnocchi & Italian Sausage</mark>.  spumoni ice cream and tiramisu for dessert.  my favorite was the calamari, cesar salad, chicken parm and desserts...everything else is okay.  i didn't care to much for the salmon, though.  the portions were huge; had to take a lot of it home.  i didn't understand how they just put the ice cream in a warm bowl...by the time we got it, it was melted.  maybe they should put it in an ice bowl??  the waiter was nice and service was quick.  view is nice...oversees the wynn properties.  there is also a man that walks around in his violin to play music for you; which i believe you have to tip him. \n\nit's a good place to eat if there is a big group of you and craving italian food.", 
            "on my last outing to this venerable restaurant overlooking the strip on the edge of fashion show, maggiano's redeemed itself with a fine repast and picturesque view of encore.  our telephoned request for a booth with a strip view was honored despite the chagrined look of other hopefuls whom the maitre d' had to fend off to preserve our pre-reserved perch.  golden <mark>Calamari Fritt</mark> was on point and well made this time.  both rings and tentacles were lightly deep fried and excellent with great requested lemon aioli and mild marinara sauce.  bread and butter were very good, and, as always, a bowl of savory tuscan orzo & sausage soup sporting <mark>Gnocchi & Italian Sausage</mark>, fennel, white beans, fresh tomatoes, and plenty of orzo was excellent.  where this soup is concerned, to enjoy more stomach-warming, fluid rustic goodness i now always order a bowl rather than a mere cup.\n\na side <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> with grated parmesan and focaccia croutons in a creamy caesar dressing was excellent.  and, stuffed chicken pizzaiola with mozzarella, ricotta, tropheo pasta, pomodoro, red peppers, and pepperoncini was fine once i got to the middle of the chicken.  it was similar to chicken cordon bleu but zestier.  as usual, a side of fontina potatoes was creamy and delicious.  \n\nthis time we experienced excellent service as noel, our server, without any prodding, carefully spaced out our meal orders so that the various dishes would not come out of the kitchen on top of each other.  all went well except for me killing one of my favorite polo shirts with food stains from marinara sauce followed by splatters from the orzo & sausage soup.  after treating the stubborn marks with both zout and goo gone, after six washings they still remain.  i will not give up either the sauce or the soup.  but next time i am in their close proximity, regardless of appearances i will don a napkin to protect the front of whatever shirt i may be wearing at the time!\n\nfor a chain, this is truly a fine one!", 
            "atmosphere and service were great; however the food was just average. \n\nlobster carbonara tasted like what you would expect from the olive garden.\n<mark>Gnocchi & Italian Sausage</mark> flat bread was ok as well.\n\nthere are plenty of other restaurants in vegas that i would try again.", 
            "for over six years now, whenever my wife and i go to vegas, this place has been a favorite. i love the gnocchi and <mark>Gnocchi & Italian Sausage</mark>, but haven't had anything i didn't like. \n\npicture this: last night; monday night; in vegas again on business; four of us looking for a good meal; walk up to the counter and they are telling everyone it's an hour and a half wait; good thing i had a reservation. we were seated in minutes, 8:06 to be exact. not bad for an 8:00 reservation. \n\nit was all good, as always. the service and especially the food!",

(yes, i had to take a bite for myself!)\n\nwe ordered a bottle of chianti for $36 (i think) and it was pretty good and went well with the food.  if you're planning on having at least 2-3 glass, that would be a better option than ordering by the glass which is usually $10/glass.\n\nabove all, our server was really nice, friendly and fun. i think her name is lori (?)\n\ntheir freshly baked bread was soooo good, nice, fluffy and warm. i am not really a big bread eater, especially before my meal, but i ended up eating 3 pieces - dipped in the olive oil vinaigrette and grated parmesan cheese. yumm!  \n\nwe didn't have a reservation so we were told we have a half hour wait. we were waiting for about 15 minutes but  luckily, we found a table at the bar, first come first serve, so we ended up eating at the bar area, which was just fine by us. they serve the full menu there as well.  they have a nice outdoor seating area as well. \ni'd recommend that you call and make a reservation if you have a large group or don't want to wait to be seated.\n\nsooo, next time i'm in vegas, i'm definitely going back there, to try out their seafood linguine!",

            "3 1/2 stars to be fair.\n\ni went to maggiano's for lunch during a business seminar.  don't you just love some free food every once in a while for all your hard work?  it was certainly a nice treat for me!\n\nafter initial introductions and the start of the seminar, food starting coming out of the kitchen.  all served family style which was a bit odd for me because i barely knew the two dozen people in the room!  but ah, not a big deal as long as none of them had herpes or mono...or a cold for that matter.\n\nour appetizer courses came first:  along with warm french bread (excellent) we had the:\n\n*<mark>Tomato Caprese</mark> - tomatoes topped with fresh mozzarella and basil, topped with olive oil and balsamic glaze\n\n*mozzarella marinara - breaded mozzarella with marinara sauce\n\n*<mark>Maggiano's Salad</mark> - iceberg and romaine lettuce with bleu cheese, crispy prosciutoo, red onions, topped with their signature dressing\n\npretty good start!  the salad was crisp, but my fav was the <mark>Tomato Caprese</mark>, sweet and ripe tomatoes with the silky cheese and the acidic touch from the balsamic?  very nice!  i didn't try the mozzarella marinara in trying to keep with my p90x diet...damn you i say tony horton!\n\nnext up was our main courses:\n\n*<mark><mark><mark>Chicken Parmesan</mark></mark></mark> - breaded chicken breasts baked with provolone cheese and marinara sauce over spaghetti\n\n*our famous rigatoni 'd' - rigatoni with herb-roasted chicken, mushrooms, and caramelized onions with a marsala cream sauce\n\n*<mark>Mom's Lasagna</mark>-meat sauce - pasta layered with ricotta cheese, <mark>Meatball</mark>, <mark>Gnocchi & Italian Sausage</mark>, and marinara sauce, topped with provolone cheese and meat sauce\n\nnice!  all were good.  unfortunately, i ate like a banshee here...i dug the <mark><mark><mark>Chicken Parmesan</mark></mark></mark> and <mark>Mom's Lasagna</mark> very much!  the sauce was great, not too sweet, not too tart, and complemented the dishes very well.  oh my thighs...the horror!!!\n\nafter the business presentation dessert was brought out:\n\n*apple crostada - granny smith apples baked in a pastry crust topped with crystallized sugar, topped with caramel sauce and vanilla bean ice cream\n\n*chocolate zuccotto cake - chocolate cake layered with sambuca chocolate mousse, iced with chocolate frosting, then dusted with cocoa powder\n\nat this point i was too full to have any more!  but i gave in and had a bit of the apple crostada.  yummy to my tummy!  the tart apples went well with the sweet sugar crust.  good way to end the meal.  bad way to end my diet!\n\nfood here is great for a chain restaurant.  the ambiance is nice, dark woods and colors.  it would be very nice for a date night out.  i may just come back here again and actually shell out my visa to try more of their dishes.  as a note though, i did look through the menu and see a lot of their dishes are on the pricey side.  but, one dish could probably feed two people easily. \n\nthankful for my one day reprieve...i am back to my p90x diet and the ramblings of the devil's spawn named tony horton.  one more push up or pull up and i think i'm gonna be sick!", 
            "when it comes to vegas restaurants, this would not have been my first choice. there is one near my house and i prefer to eat at places i have never been while i am on vacation, but it was my friends birthday dinner. we had a party of 11, so we had to order off the family style menu. we looked at the menu in advance so we already knew what we would be getting when we got there. we ordered the fried mozzarella and <mark>Stuffed Mushrooms</mark> to start. for entrees we ordered a lobster carbonara, <mark><mark><mark>Chicken Parmesan</mark></mark></mark>, beef medallions and a bow tie pasta. we thought we would get one plate of each, but they brought 2 of each, one for each end of the table.  we where well fed. dessert was my favorite. house made terramissu and apple cobbler. wonderful! \n\nour server was wonderful too. she was very friendly and attentive. our drinks never ran dry. it was a great experience. =)", 
            "not only was the food amazing and reasonably priced for the strip, they were really accommodating to our time crunch because we were seeing a show after.  my table had gnocchi, <mark><mark><mark>Chicken Parmesan</mark></mark></mark>, <mark>Baked Eggplant Parmesan</mark>, and the rigatoni d and they were all extremely good.  the only word of advice is to park in treasure island or the wynn/encore.  the mall parking is far from the restaurant.", 
            "took a recent trip to vegas and after walking around starving me and my bf decided to try out maggiano's.  the ambiance is beautiful with rich furnishings and amazing views of the strip. bread is brought to the table with butter, but there is also olive oil on the table if you prefer to dip with that. we started with an appetizer of <mark>Tomato Caprese</mark> that was very good, next we shared the smaller version of the <mark>Spinach Salad</mark> that was amazing (bacon, pine nuts, super yummy dressing etc), and finally we split a plate of the <mark><mark><mark>Chicken Parmesan</mark></mark></mark> that was a large portion, so big in fact we ended up taking the rest to go in a box. in total, those 3 dishes 1 water and 1 coke was $37 which i thought was very reasonable. the sever was friendly, prompt and attentive. there was also a man with a guitar that would sing you a song at the time if you would like. overall i liked the mood of the restaurant, the romantic feel, delicious food and wonderful service. no complaints.", 
            "this is my fourth visit and the food and service seem pretty much consistent.  ordered the margherita pizza for an appetizer and for my main course i had the spinach and <mark>Chicken & Spinach Manicotti</mark>.  fortunately, i also got to try the linguine di mare and the <mark><mark><mark>Chicken Parmesan</mark></mark></mark> that my party ordered.  they were all delicious but the manicotti has to be my favorite.  \n\nthis is a very inexpensive restaurant with generous portions, so it's definitely worth the try after a long day of shopping.  be sure to call in advance otherwise you'd be waiting as long as an hour and a half to be seated.  ask for a table next to the window with view of lvblvd, not one of the best, but still a pretty sight for you out of towners.", 
            "do not pass go, do not collect $200.....go directly to maggiano's!  i had read the reviews about maggiano's catering to their gluten free patrons and looked forward to our visit.  we were not disappointed.  i asked about a gluten free menu and the waiter told us they didn't have a menu, but almost anything on the menu could be made gluten free.  they even offered to coat the chicken in potato chips and pan fry it if i wanted <mark><mark><mark>Chicken Parmesan</mark></mark></mark>.  someone pinch me, i must be dreaming.  to make our visit even better we happened to come during happy hour when their signature cocktails were only $6.  yes please!  i ended up ordering the lobster carbonara and hubby ordered veal parmesan.  all i can say is wow.  my meal was beyond fantastic.  i fully expected tiny pieces of lobster and was astounded when my plate arrived and there were large chunks of lobster.  both meals were enough for two so we gladly took our leftovers back to our room and had them for lunch the next day.  hubby's grandmother came straight from italy and trust me, these meals rivaled hers.  my only disappointment is we don't have a maggiano's where we live.  seriously, it was that good.", 
            "went here today (22nd aug) whilst in vegas, we haven't left vegas yet and i felt i needed to write a review.\n\neverything from start to finish was horrible. i ordered the <mark><mark><mark>Chicken Parmesan</mark></mark></mark>. the chicken was tough, over cooked and tasteless. it came with a side of spaghetti marinara. the spaghetti was over cooked, mushy and the whole thing was very plain.\nneedless to say i didn't even eat half of my meal.\n\nmy friend ordered some sort of pasta and seafood dish (i cannot remember the name) and despite that naturally having slightly more flavour due to it being seafood, the pasta was mushy also and tasteless. \n\ni asked for bottled water, they brought me tap water which i thought ok cool nevermind... i don't know what they did to the tap water there but (maybe it was the ice cubes they used?) but there was a hideous aftertaste of antiseptic! \n\nour server never checked on us once, because if so i would have told her i disliked my meal and also ordered another drink. we had to ask her for the cheque three times and after we finished eating our meal and were given our cheque, it was 25 minutes before our plates were cleared.\n\nneedless to say i will not be returning.", 
            "i love maggianos. i can't get enough of the famous rigatoni d. & they have the best calamari. i am also in love with the marinara sauce they use for the spaghetti as well as the <mark><mark><mark>Chicken Parmesan</mark></mark></mark>. friendly staff & usually not very crowded when i come here. & i feel like i'm in the 1940s with the music they play. definitely one of my favorite places to eat.", 
            "sara our server was fantastic.  we had a large group of 16 people for our wedding dinner.  i had made reservations 2 weeks in advance. they called the day prior to the reservation to confirm and then they called the morning of the reservation date to get my order for the family style dinner. i selected from the chefs selection menu. lobster baked tilapia, <mark><mark><mark>Chicken Parmesan</mark></mark></mark>, mushroom il fornaio and beef tenderloin medallions. for appetizers we selected the calamari, caprese and bruschetta.  for dessert we selected creme br\\u00fbl\\u00e9e and tiramisu. absolutely everyone enjoyed everything they ate! the meat entrees were all tender and juicy. nothing was over cooked or under cooked. the food was served timely- longest wait was 5 mins between appetizers and entrees.  the portions and amount of food can be described as abundant. the customer service was perfect. they allowed us to bring our wedding cake earlier in day and served it at the end of the wedding feast! i highly recommend them for special events!", 
            "my husband and i stopped in for an early weekend lunch recently. we had the entire place to ourselves for a bit around 11:30. it's attached to the fashion show mall, and it seemed like most were just grabbing a quick bite in the food court instead. \n\ni liked the fact that our server asked if we preferred butter or olive oil and parmesan to go along with our bread. gimme' the oil and parm, please! a pet peeve of mine is that a few select italian restaurants in st. louis want to up-charge for this... yes, seriously. anywho, we carbed out on the stuff. :)\n\ni ordered the chicken and spinach cannelloni, while my husband went with the <mark><mark><mark>Chicken Parmesan</mark></mark></mark>. both lunch portions were friggin' huge! my husband actually had two full breasts of chicken on his plate served with a large side of pasta. four noodles came in my order, and had big chunks of chicken in every bite. we made a good dent in the dishes, but still had plenty left over. we both agreed that it was good, but it didn't compare to the good ole' authentic italian we both love so much.", 
            "this place was great. my dad loves a good spaghetti and <mark>Meatball</mark>, it's his go to favorite meal.  and me myself, i love <mark><mark><mark>Chicken Parmesan</mark></mark></mark>. we went here  when we were visiting my dad in the fall. we had a great, amazing view of the strip, and it was right as the sun going down... perfect.\n\nwe all had great food, and great service. i know it's a chain but it was still good to enjoy it and the environment was great.\n\nhopefully, next trip out to vegas to visit me dad, we can stop again.", 
            "we went for dinner and i made reservations on opentable which is super easy. we arrived and were seated within a couple minutes. the waiter came to the table and we told him that my wife has a gluten allergy and he said that would not be a problem and took our drink order and said he would be back to get our food order. when he came back he had the chef who ask my wife what she wanted and said he could make pretty much anything she wanted and she decided on the <mark><mark><mark>Chicken Parmesan</mark></mark></mark> which she loved. my 11 year old got the mama's lasagna & my 13 year old got the <mark>Fettuccine Alfredo</mark> and they both thought it was epic. i enjoyed my veal parmesan and instead of the spaghetti i asked for the <mark>Fettuccine Alfredo</mark> and they said no problem. i have to say the food was good but the service was great. my wife got the creme br\\u00fbl\\u00e9e for desert which she always enjoys. it has become a must visit when we go to vegas.",

            "we thoroughly enjoyed our meal here. we were able to get a seat quickly. \n\nbread service was my favorite part. balsamic vinegar in olive oil to dip the bread. yummy!!!  \n\ni had the <mark>Fettuccine Alfredo</mark> while my husband had <mark><mark><mark>Chicken Parmesan</mark></mark></mark>. huge portions that we had wrapped up for later. our daughter inhaled her ravioli. included in her kid's meal was ice cream. instead of shouting out about the ice cream in front of our daughter our fabulous server asked my husband discreetly if it was ok for her to have it. loved that!!!!!! \n\nprice was decent. food was terrific. service was fabulous. definitely recommend.", 
            "thank you maggiano's  for making my moms birthday dinner special ! the manager jesse was friendly , helpful and came to our table personally to make sure we were okay . our waiter nick was  professional and knowledgeable about the menu and what to suggest , an absolute delight ! we got the <mark>Calamari Fritt</mark> , <mark><mark><mark>Chicken Parmesan</mark></mark></mark> , veal marsala , <mark>Chopped Salad</mark> with chicken  and the nonna's pound cake  for dessert !  dinner was delicious and the service was superb !",

            "this place was great!  great food, cocktails, ambience, and view of all the city lights at night.  it's located on the 2nd floor of the fashion mall across from trump towers.  i had one of their specials that was basically a chicken dish of chicken kabob-type pieces with chicken <mark>Meatball</mark> and chopped peppers, onions, and quartered potatoes. the hubs had <mark><mark><mark>Chicken Parmesan</mark></mark></mark> that came with a side of spaghetti.  everything is a la carte so we also ordered dinner salads.  great mojitos & vodka martinis. the buttered cake with marscapone cream and scoop of ice cream was ah-mazing.  we rolled out of their we were so full.  the place was hopping even at 8:30 pm.", 
            "amazing !!!!! i took my boyfriend here for his 30th birthday and omg we were blown away ! the food was amazing ! we had the bruschetta, rigatoni d, and <mark><mark><mark>Chicken Parmesan</mark></mark></mark> ! after we ate a wonderful man came and sang happy birthday to my boyfriend with his guitar. then the restaurant manager came over and asked how our night was going then insisted that we have dessert in honor of his birthday . i didn't the name of the three desserts we were given complimentary btw but it was amazing !!!!! will defiantly be returning !", 
            "i was walking the length of the strip and that's a long way! i sort of scoped out all the lunch places, and besides fast food at a mall, this seemed like the most affordable lunch spot that might be nice. i didn't need to spend $70 on lunch at some place that was trying to make me think i was in paris or something. \n\nmaggiano's is located at the edge of the fashion show mall. we arrived for a late lunch and got a nice seat by the windows. this is more or less a sort of upscale place, not a grab lunch and go kinda place. our server seemed quite professional ... but then the up selling began. just say no and keep with what you want! the wine pours come in 2 sizes, 6 and 8 oz. wine prices are not that cheap here though. the food was quite varied on the menu. one of the great deals i spotted was the soup and half sandwich for $9.95. i selected the cesar salad and <mark><mark><mark>Chicken Parmesan</mark></mark></mark> half sandwich. my bf had the cesar salad and the italian grilled cheese & ham. the server brought over bread while we waited.which was scrumptious dipped in the olive oil and balsamic vinegar.\n\n when our food arrived, i was surprised by the portions, nice and big! the salad was a decent size and the sandwich was more than enough to eat. i was expecting a real half of a sandwich from a bread loaf cut into a little triangle ...like mom used to make you! it was served on a nice italian roll and was very good indeed. i'll say this is one of the better deals in vegas on the strip. although with the wine, tax and tip, we still ended up with a near $50 lunch for 2! oh, well, skip the wine next time! i will say though, this so far is one of my fave places i've eaten at here in vegas so far. the food is very good here, and not just a slop job cause it tourists."

            "some places wow you with their style and exotic cuisine, others sneak up on you with a little more subtlety. maggiano's was one of my favorite meals in las vegas, because they just made everything easy. first of all, being in a non-smoking restaurant was literally a breath of fresh air. we got to curl up in a cozy booth facing floor to ceiling windows so it was an entirely different vibe from most casino restaurants. \n\nit is a chain, but it meant they offered a wide variety of reasonably priced options and our lunch entrees, chicken pesto linguine and <mark>Chicken Francese</mark> ($11 - 13), were excellent. one of my favorite things to eat in italy is a fresh arugula salad lightly tossed with oil, but it is hard to find in the u.s. i was thrilled when it came as a side to the <mark>Chicken Francese</mark> and it brought back so many wonderful memories. \n\nfrom our arrival through the end of service, the staff was professional, prompt and courteous. portion size was hearty, especially the pasta dish, so we even skipped dinner that night. not the most exciting choice in town, but sometimes you just want a little comfort food and air, sweet, sweet fresh air.",

            "fantastic food!  loved that yelp helped us get a reservation at the time we wanted, walked right in and they were ready for us.  i had the <mark>Chicken Caprese</mark>, a special of the day, and it was amazing!! \n\ni second the hit-and-miss service--we had to ask for more water, and for our check.  they were busy, but found that annoying.  the mints are yummy--take a few! : )\n\ndespite service issues, i would definitely return and highly recommend!", 
            "i found them using the tripadvisor application on my phone and the cool part was that i made a reservation thru the application!   i made the reservation for 6:30pm on a friday and i drove 15 minutes.   i literally walked in and sat down.  bypassed a line and they were packed.  i love this application! \n\nwhere to park:  there is complimentary valet parking at forever 21 on fashion show drive.  there is an elevator that takes you to the back of the restaurant. \n\nlocated above the las vegas strip it has a great view and ambiance. \n\ni ordered a bowl of <mark>Creamy Tomato Basil</mark> soup which was devine.  the bread complimented the meal but i was disappointed i wasn't offered italian dipping sauce (italian butter by a different name).  i love olive oil, vinegar and spices to dip my bread in.\n\ni had a large <mark>Grilled <mark>Chicken Caprese</mark> Salad</mark> as my entree and asked to substitute spinach for the mixed greens.   off the menu:  fresh mozzarella, tomatoes, cucumbers,kalamata olives, red onions, garlic croutons & white balsamic vinaigrette. \ni like that the cucumbers and chicken were diced up, perfect mouthfuls.   i could barely taste the mozzarella cheese even though they were large bites.  i would recommend a stronger cheese that can overcome the dressing and stand out on its own.  the olives were pitted and i really appreciate that.  \ni topped off the meal with a hot cappuccino.\nmy waiter, rafael e.,  was very attentive,  pleasant and visited me often.  my water glass was never empty and there were no broken dishes."

            "ate here last night and really enjoyed the food. i tried the <mark>Jumbo Lump Crab Cakes</mark>, which i really enjoyed even though i'm not a big fan of seafood. i had the chicken and spinach stuffed manicotti and loved it. the bathrooms were pretty dirty but it was late at night when we went. the service was good and we had a really good time there.", 
            "i don't see what the big deal is about this place. yeah the view is nice and all but the food is pretty average at best. we both had the <mark>Jumbo Lump Crab Cakes</mark> and they were horrible! and the service sucks. we were pretty much ignored the whole time during our meal after the food came. \n\nthe bartenders kept giving a women who was all ready clearly drunk more drinks. and she fell on her face right in front of our table and almost knocked it over with no apology from management.\n\ni should've gone to the capital grille instead.", 
            "i am not sure who reviews this place, but i know now it is not worth the rating that it is receiving. \n\nwe went here for dinner on a sunday night supposedly low season in vegas. the place was crowded, but that was not so much of an issue. the noise level in the restaurant was pretty high, but if you are lucky you might get a table with a good view of the strip.\n\nwe ordered the steamed mussels and <mark>Jumbo Lump Crab Cakes</mark> for appetizer. the grilled salmon on a bed of spinach with roasted potatoes.  kids ate the flat bread pizza and spaghetti with giant meatball.\n\n- <mark>Jumbo Lump Crab Cakes</mark> were okay, the sauce that comes with it is nice\n- mussels in red sauce (diablo if i remember well). when served they smelled funny. my first impression was that the mussels were steamed and a can of crushed tomatoes was thrown over them. some spaghetti strings were visible, so i was wondering where the sauce really came from?! but, that was not the problem; the smell was just unbearable that i could not eat these mussels. returned them and was notified by the waitress that it was not the first time that the mussels smelled. manager came and offered us another dish, we ordered the fried calamari ... and it was okay.\n- salmon on a bed of spinach with roasted potatoes; the salmon was a bit overcooked and was sitting in the juices of the spinach. not very appetizing to see, i like grilled fish to remain dry when served. the potatoes were really overcooked and very dry on the inside ... they were left to roast just beyond what they needed.\n- flat bread pizza, not too bad for a kids meal\n- spaghetti with giant meatball; i am not sure what people like about \"giant\" food, but for me it looks disgusting. \n\nwe were not charged for the mussels nor for the fried calamari, which is great customer service. \n\noverall, maybe worth a two or three star but definitely not more than that if you grade it on the food.", 
            "2 1/2 more like it. \nthey put lots of food on the plates, it's just that it's really nothing too special. the best of the lot we tried were the mussels, and the side <mark>Spinach Salad</mark> was okay as well. \nas for the veal picata, or the <mark>Jumbo Lump Crab Cakes</mark>...would  pass on them. \nwines in the limited selection are reasonably priced. \nalong with the large portions, prices are reasonable.. and that keeps the place packed with patrons... reservations are recommended.", 
            "came back to maggiano's for what my friend and i call \"wine wednesday!\" we used to have this event (of 2 people, haha) every week but as we all know people get busy. i find it a great place for happy hour wine and appetizers. they have added some new items to the menu from when we used to go, but that's great! \n\ni had last my voice the previous weekend so the bartenders were having a good time with me while i waited for my friends. they are very friendly guys and very attentive. i got there about 445pm and found seating at the bar right away. once my friends did get there i ordered the merlot and the bartenders were on top of it! \n\nfor food i ordered the bruschetta and <mark>Jumbo Lump Crab Cakes</mark>, soooo yummy! i think i could continually eat the <mark>Jumbo Lump Crab Cakes</mark>. just keep them coming! overall, my experience here is always great. the food always comes out perfect and great service. i have yet to come and eat for dinner, whats holding me back? oh yah i live in the nw and this place is easy to come to after work. one day i will though!",

            "maggiano's\n- its happy hour is no longer as good as before (now 3stars on my book), although still a great\n4-star restaurant for dinner.\n\nyelpy details:\n- this nice mid-scale restaurant is\nconveniently located on the strip nearby the lively fashion mall district. it used to be my favorite spot for hh on the strip. it has an inviting bar area with a classy bar counter and several bar tables around, with a good selection of drinks and excellent service. but my wife and i just had an unsatifying hh experience there recently.\n\n- one early fri evening inmid-august, mywife and i came here for happy hour again and were disappointed that:\n(1) they not only took away our favorite \"fried zucchinis\" from the happy hour food menu,\n(2) but also, the entire bar menu now contained a grand total of only one item, i.e., flatbread! luckily the flatbread was delicious.\n- well, my wife and i used to bring our out-of-town guests here for happy hour and dinner. the place was almost always very crowded with happy customers in the past, especially during its happy hour. but, on this fri evening (around 5:30pm),the bar area was practically empty, with only 2 tables occupied and only one customer at the bar counter! we thought it could have a lot to do with the now very limited happy hour menu, our nice and efficient waitress agreed.\n- well, one more good point: we were nevertheless pleased that they still give out their best tasting warm bread free, which tasted heavenly especially dipped in olive oil/basamic vinegar!\n\nbottom line for hh:\n- due to the diminished value and the \"empty-space-atmosphere\" (on a fri evening at that!), i'd now give it only 3 stars for hh.\n\non the other hand, to be fair, just back in march, we brought friends over there for dinner (not hh), we did have a fabulous time, with tasty dishes, drinks and superb service! so, we wish that maggiano management would do something to bring back their popular hh menu and fill its place again for hh!\n- hints: please put back \"fried zucchinis\", and perhaps even add \"<mark>Jumbo Lump Crab Cakes</mark>\" to its bar menu, which is a great hit on schottsdale maggiano's hh menu anyway!\n- until then, i could still go there for a good dinner, but will not likely go back there just for happy hour.\n\npeterskis, august 2012",

            "went to maggiano's on sunday night for surprise engagement dinner. we were a group of 11 and only had to wait around 20 minutes. we were able to share a bottle of prosecco at the bar during the wait. we were told our table was ready and they led us into the wine cellar. i was so excited to be in a private room with dimmed lighting.\n\nfrom dinner we ordered the classic family style and were given the choices of two appetizers, salads, pastas, entrees and desserts. the food doesn't stop. the only hard part was agreeing on what to order. \n\nappetizers: <mark>Calamari Fritt</mark>\\u00e9 and bruschetta. \nsalads: ceasar and chopped.\npastas: <mark>Mom's Lasagna</mark> and chicken & truffle tortellacci \nentrees: chicken saltimbocca and <mark>Baked Eggplant Parmesan</mark>\ndesserts: creme brulee and chocolate zuccotto cake \n\nmy favorites were the <mark>Chopped Salad</mark>, love blue cheese! chicken & truffle tortellacci was the most interesting flavors and the <mark>Baked Eggplant Parmesan</mark> had the perfect breaded textured and eggplant was cooked just right. creme brulee was fantastic and huge, but by that point we were so full. i would also recommend the chianti castello di querceto. went really well with the <mark>Mom's Lasagna</mark>.\n\nryan was our server and he was fantastic. very attentive and helpful. they even brought in two older men who played guitar and violin and had us do our first dance. the night was great. thank you maggiano's and ryan!", 
            "3 1/2 stars to be fair.\n\ni went to maggiano's for lunch during a business seminar.  don't you just love some free food every once in a while for all your hard work?  it was certainly a nice treat for me!\n\nafter initial introductions and the start of the seminar, food starting coming out of the kitchen.  all served family style which was a bit odd for me because i barely knew the two dozen people in the room!  but ah, not a big deal as long as none of them had herpes or mono...or a cold for that matter.\n\nour appetizer courses came first:  along with warm french bread (excellent) we had the:\n\n*<mark>Tomato Caprese</mark> - tomatoes topped with fresh mozzarella and basil, topped with olive oil and balsamic glaze\n\n*mozzarella marinara - breaded mozzarella with marinara sauce\n\n*<mark>Maggiano's Salad</mark> - iceberg and romaine lettuce with bleu cheese, crispy prosciutoo, red onions, topped with their signature dressing\n\npretty good start!  the salad was crisp, but my fav was the <mark>Tomato Caprese</mark>, sweet and ripe tomatoes with the silky cheese and the acidic touch from the balsamic?  very nice!  i didn't try the mozzarella marinara in trying to keep with my p90x diet...damn you i say tony horton!\n\nnext up was our main courses:\n\n*<mark><mark><mark>Chicken Parmesan</mark></mark></mark> - breaded chicken breasts baked with provolone cheese and marinara sauce over spaghetti\n\n*our famous rigatoni 'd' - rigatoni with herb-roasted chicken, mushrooms, and caramelized onions with a marsala cream sauce\n\n*<mark>Mom's Lasagna</mark>-meat sauce - pasta layered with ricotta cheese, <mark>Meatball</mark>, <mark>Gnocchi & Italian Sausage</mark>, and marinara sauce, topped with provolone cheese and meat sauce\n\nnice!  all were good.  unfortunately, i ate like a banshee here...i dug the <mark><mark><mark>Chicken Parmesan</mark></mark></mark> and <mark>Mom's Lasagna</mark> very much!  the sauce was great, not too sweet, not too tart, and complemented the dishes very well.  oh my thighs...the horror!!!\n\nafter the business presentation dessert was brought out:\n\n*apple crostada - granny smith apples baked in a pastry crust topped with crystallized sugar, topped with caramel sauce and vanilla bean ice cream\n\n*chocolate zuccotto cake - chocolate cake layered with sambuca chocolate mousse, iced with chocolate frosting, then dusted with cocoa powder\n\nat this point i was too full to have any more!  but i gave in and had a bit of the apple crostada.  yummy to my tummy!  the tart apples went well with the sweet sugar crust.  good way to end the meal.  bad way to end my diet!\n\nfood here is great for a chain restaurant.  the ambiance is nice, dark woods and colors.  it would be very nice for a date night out.  i may just come back here again and actually shell out my visa to try more of their dishes.  as a note though, i did look through the menu and see a lot of their dishes are on the pricey side.  but, one dish could probably feed two people easily. \n\nthankful for my one day reprieve...i am back to my p90x diet and the ramblings of the devil's spawn named tony horton.  one more push up or pull up and i think i'm gonna be sick!", 
            "as i was shopping at fashion show mall i noticed this italian restaurant and made a mental note to check it out on yelp later for a possible dinner option.\n\naccording to yelp this place was worth trying. i used the open table feature to make a reservation (not knowing if it was really needed or not, but i figured why not). i'm glad i did. when we made it in to the restaurant it was packed and there was a wait. we were seated immediately. \n\nwe were seated in a comfortable booth seat, and served water immediately and given some explanation of the menu. this place had a good variety of italian food from pastas, to chicken, beef and seafood selections. i liked that they had a family style option as well. at first glance i would say this place looks pricey specially since your entr\\u00e9e comes with just your entr\\u00e9e no salad or soup like olive garden. \n\nwe ordered a side salad to share that was $4.95 but it was the perfect size for two specially since we were stuffing our faces with the yummy french bread served with olive oil and vinegar (oh so yummy, and dangerous!). \n\nour plates took over 30 minutes to arrive, if it was not for the bread and salad i would have been more upset. \n\ni ordered <mark>Mom's Lasagna</mark> made with <mark>Meatball</mark> and sausage with your choice of marinara or meat sauce. i choose marinara since so much meat came with the dish already. my plate arrived and what do you know, it probably could have served four people, fairly large portions. i ate all of it, in phases but i ate it all. it was exquisite. perfect layering, the lasagna stayed together (i hate when you cut into lasagna and the layers fall apart). \n\nmy favorite part was being serenaded by a duo (violin and guitar) to one of my wedding songs (it's impossible). if it weren't for the wynn in the background i could almost say i was in italy.\n\ni don't have any complaints about this place. our total bill came to $37.50: two entrees, one side salad and one beverage. we came on a monday night and it was busy so definitely try and make reservations if you can.",

            "it's safe to say, i'm a maggiano's regular. & i think the vegas location is probably the best one- overlooking the strip, yet safely located in the fashion show mall & not quite 'on the strip'. fun for people watching during the day (love sitting outside, if not too cold, hot or windy!) then transforms at nite when the 2 windowed walls facing the strip allow you to dine alongside the buzz & beauty of the vegas lights. while ambiance is a factor in why i like maggiano's, consistency is the reason i go back time & time again. i don't believe i've ever had a bad meal or experience there (other than occasionally being sardined on busier nites). unbeknownst to me, at some point, maggiano's even changed ownership; i couldn't tell, because unlike other cases when there's an ownership change, nothing about the quality changed. i'm part of their email list so i get emails with coupons every couple months. a few no-fails on the menu: <mark>Tomato Caprese</mark>, <mark>Stuffed Mushrooms</mark>, rigatoni d (though not great for leftovers, because of the cream sauce), <mark>Mom's Lasagna</mark> (had it for the 1st time last nite & it's one of the best, not too mushy), eggplant parm (generous portion), the best chicken parm i've ever graced my mouth with & linguine di mare (substantial seafood). for dessert, if you're still feeling gluttonous, go for the apple crostada... otherwise, we generally get the kids scoop of vanilla bean icecream with hot fudge. also, keep maggiano's in mind for thanksgiving & christmas dining, if you're in town visiting or if you just don't feel like cooking- they do a wonderful job with the menus & you'll surely have leftovers, for a reasonable price. it's easy to mosey in & be seated right away for lunch but i recommend reservations for any time after 4:00.",

            "we went at around 6pm on a weeknight.  there was a 15-20 minute wait for a table for 4 but there was no wait for the tables at the bar so we opted for this.  service was excellent.  the portions were very large for the price -- the full size pastas came in 8\"-9\" casserole dishes and about 3\" deep.  everyone at the table was satisfied with their dishes (<mark>Fettuccine Alfredo</mark>, <mark>Taylor Street Baked Ziti</mark> and sausage, some type of seafood pasta -- it was on the little italy favorites menu).  i ordered the <mark>Baked Eggplant Parmesan</mark> which i wasn't too fond of.  i found it to be too breaded and mushy, not what i'm used to.  otherwise, great atmosphere, great prices.  there was even a wedding party at the table next to ours!", 
            "went to maggiano's on sunday night for surprise engagement dinner. we were a group of 11 and only had to wait around 20 minutes. we were able to share a bottle of prosecco at the bar during the wait. we were told our table was ready and they led us into the wine cellar. i was so excited to be in a private room with dimmed lighting.\n\nfrom dinner we ordered the classic family style and were given the choices of two appetizers, salads, pastas, entrees and desserts. the food doesn't stop. the only hard part was agreeing on what to order. \n\nappetizers: <mark>Calamari Fritt</mark>\\u00e9 and bruschetta. \nsalads: ceasar and chopped.\npastas: <mark>Mom's Lasagna</mark> and chicken & truffle tortellacci \nentrees: chicken saltimbocca and <mark>Baked Eggplant Parmesan</mark>\ndesserts: creme brulee and chocolate zuccotto cake \n\nmy favorites were the <mark>Chopped Salad</mark>, love blue cheese! chicken & truffle tortellacci was the most interesting flavors and the <mark>Baked Eggplant Parmesan</mark> had the perfect breaded textured and eggplant was cooked just right. creme brulee was fantastic and huge, but by that point we were so full. i would also recommend the chianti castello di querceto. went really well with the <mark>Mom's Lasagna</mark>.\n\nryan was our server and he was fantastic. very attentive and helpful. they even brought in two older men who played guitar and violin and had us do our first dance. the night was great. thank you maggiano's and ryan!", 
            "this has to be my favorite italian restaurant in vegas. it feels like you just wanna be with your family when you come here. <mark>Baked Eggplant Parmesan</mark> with meat sauce is one of my faves. i wouldn't normally order fried calamari at any other restaurant but it's the first thing i wanna order when i get here. it's light and not chewy which i looove! my son eats up most of his spaghetti and can't get enough. mama's lasagna is pretty mean too. i'm looking forward to trying other stuff on the menu. but all i can think about is the eggplant parm!", 
            "i just love maggiano's. not usually a fan of big chains, but i just love them. i have one close to where i live and ate there only because we had been given a gift certificate. \n\nwhile in vegas with my family, i insisted we have a big family meal at maggiano's. we made reservations for 7:30 on a tuesday night. \n\nwe arrived on time, but had to wait more than thirty minutes to be seated. the place was totally packed, so we had to stand, smashed together, in the bar area while we waited. that sucked, and made me wonder why we bothered with reservations.\n\nour server was extremely busy (there was an 18 top in our section), but he did a fantastic job, considering how busy he was, and how many questions and picky orders my family came up with.\n\nthe food was fantastic. i ordered the spinach artichoke appetizer and the <mark>Baked Eggplant Parmesan</mark>. everyone at the table absolutely loved the spinach artichoke. however, we prefered it on the table bread, as opposed to the \"crostini\" it's served with. the little pieces of crostini are too small and too hard for the yummilicious, creamy, piping hot, rich spinach artichoke dip. \n\nmy eggplant parm was beautiful and delicious. unfortunately, in total vegas style, it was enormous. a small family could have shared it (i have a big family....haha). it was just perfect. i'm not used to whole pieces of roasted garlic in my eggplant parm, but they were delightful little treats to discover here and there. it couldn't have been better, honestly. four meals came out of it- the one that night, a midnight snack later, my meal on the plane the next day, and my husband's lunch the next day. it was even delicious cold!\n\nfor desert, my sister ordered the 5 desert platter. it had tiramisu, cheesecake, chocolate cake, apple pie ala mode, and....i can't remember the last one. it was so pretty- and only $9.95. the whole table shared it, and we still had leftovers. i'm not a fan of sweets, so i only nibbled a couple things. my sister said it was the best cheesecake she'd ever had.\n\nall in all, it was a fantastic night. i remember sitting back for a moment, looking around the table... everyone was laughing, eating, and having a wonderful time.", 
            "not only was the food amazing and reasonably priced for the strip, they were really accommodating to our time crunch because we were seeing a show after.  my table had gnocchi, <mark><mark><mark>Chicken Parmesan</mark></mark></mark>, <mark>Baked Eggplant Parmesan</mark>, and the rigatoni d and they were all extremely good.  the only word of advice is to park in treasure island or the wynn/encore.  the mall parking is far from the restaurant.", 
            "the purpose of our visit to maggiano's was to carb-load the night before the las vegas marathon (which two of our party were actually running, the other two were there to support the runners.  and the carb loading!).  we were looking for somewhere close to treasure island at a reasonable price, and maggiano's fit the bill. we made reservations through open table and were seated at our scheduled time.\n\nthe inside of the restaurant was quite nice but the tables are soooooo close together, i kept bumping into the guy behind me.  there was a large party of obnoxious loud people, but this tends to be the case at a lot of places in vegas.  we split the bruschetta as an appetizer, and while it was delicious, for the price i was expecting a bit more.  however, they made up for portion sizes with the entrees!  my <mark>Baked Eggplant Parmesan</mark> was posetively massive, but still elegantly served which i appreciated.  another in our party had the chicken tortelloni's and the two others had the gnocchi.  honestly, mine was pretty good but i liked everyone else's selections better.  maybe i just chose something i wasn't in the mood for.\n\nthe bill was reasonable for vegas and the meal served its primary purpose.  however, in comparison to alot of other places, it was just okay, and i wouldn't add it to my \"must visit while in vegas\" list.", 
            "best italian food i've ever had* (and i'm italian!)\n\nevery time my girlfriends and i visited las vegas we would come here at least twice (over a week holiday) to have dinner. i love that the restaurant serves up food family style (read: larger portions meant to be shared among family and/or friends) which is how italian people serve their meals at home to their own families. \n\nthe food is authentic, delicious and the servers always know their s***. i usually go for appetizers (caprese, <mark>Crispy Zucchini Fritt</mark>, mozzerella marinara)  and a main (ravioli, <mark>Baked Eggplant Parmesan</mark>, manicotti). one of my friends always raves about the <mark>Taylor Street Baked Ziti</mark>. \n\none of the best parts is that every time you ordered a main you could get a side of your choice of pasta  (from a list) with a choice of sauce for an extra 1 or 2$. we used to get this to go and eat it poolside the next afternoon for lunch. cheap (sweet, more shopping!) and delicious!!!! i even brought some home on the flight for friends and family once. \n\n*obviously not counting my relatives home-made italian cooking. and the food is on par with the food served at terroni in toronto, canada.", 
            "disclaimer: the only time i come here is for large birthday gatherings featuring: (1) the extremely young; and (2) the extremely old.  i've never independently chosen to eat here.\n\ni will say they have their sh$t together when it comes to large private gatherings.  they're always well staffed and organized, unlike other spots in town (*cough* pj clarkes *cough*).  the private rooms are also spacious and feature large windows -- you're not in some afterthought back room.\n\nfurther, the portions they provide for groups are enormous.  even if there are 10 people at a table, it never runs out.  in fact, i usually get stuck with taking home leftovers.  just what i always wanted, 4 lbs of artichoke dip......\n\nbut, large portions aren't really a godsend if the food is just meh.  i've had the chicken & <mark>Baked Eggplant Parmesan</mark>, chicken piccata, penne with meat sauce, spagetti, <mark>Caesar Salad</mark>, <mark>Stuffed Mushrooms</mark>, calamari, profiteroles and...... none of it was memorable. \n\noverall, they serve up very basic italian food meant to please the masses......something easily achieved when the patrons are seven-years-old.....", 
            "there's a maggiano's in my hometown of san jose. strangely enough, i have never been to that place. so this was my first time ever at maggiano's! whoa.\n\nwe pretty much hit the jackpot with parking. the underground lot of the fashion show mall has several entrances, and although we entered from the south end of the mall, we found our way to the northeast corner (which was actually near an exit) and found a perfect, surprisingly non-wheelchair parking space very close to the elevator that takes you directly to the back of maggiano's.\n\nafter walking through to the host desk at the front, we got seated fairly quickly. it was a busy lunch hour, but not absolutely jampacked. we were seated by a window, thankfully, and we got to see some of the wynn and palazzo. i had a blast watching the wynn divider move up and down the led screen. who needs a tv?\n\ni somewhat surprised myself for asking for coffee. i was dead tired from accumulate sleep debt this week, so it was worth every penny of the $2.95. our server was funny though. he took care to turn the saucer such that the spoon and coffee mug handle were angled to my left, even though it's kinda assumed that most people (including yours truly) are right-handed.\n\ni have a lot of love for the <mark>Baked Eggplant Parmesan</mark>. so does my mom. she ordered it (and saved the leftovers for a special someone) along with the stuffed mushroom appetizers. my aunt went with the linguini and clams with white clam sauce, and i had the veal parmesan.\n\njust like in most italian restaurants, we got started off with complimentary bread with olive oil / vinegar dipping sauce. nice crust on the outside and soft absorbent inside. what more do you want?\n\nthe mushrooms came out first of the orders, and they were delicious. couldn't care less that basically bread crumbs and fungus (with spinach and garlic). according to my mom, the version she knows from san jose uses a higher number of smaller mushrooms. i guess you gotta go big in vegas though, and i didn't mind fork-and-knifing it. i thought that the parmesan cheese available table-side did enhance the flavor, which some might view as a shortcoming.\n\ni sampled some linguini too. it's pretty good, although the clam-to-noodle ratio reminds me strongly of ramen, in a not-that-appealing way. i like to have more of a balance of protein and starch.\n\nmy veal was nicely pounded, breaded, and fried and was sufficiently tender as far as that goes. the melted provolone and marinara sauce and the accompanying spaghetti were all great complements. i just realized that i didn't dust off my leftover veal with parmesan before leaving, which makes me a bit sad.\n\noverall, it was good, solid italian food. one of the best parts, really, was the view, which strongly correlates with the obvious las vegas strip price markups. it's alright though - i would have been hard-pressed to spend the $50 in gift cards at another time. yay for heavy reductions on out-of-pocket costs!", 
            "we ate there during our last trip to vegas. i loved their <mark>Baked Eggplant Parmesan</mark>. nick our server was great. we ate outside on the patio. the service was great. the manager even stopped by to ask us how our food was. i loved their mist outside to cool us during the hot weather.\nthey don't offer the take one home meal like all other maggiano's. i could've used it.\nnevertheless a great experience\nhighly recommended.", 
            "we dined here last night with a party of 10.  ordered the family style dinner and were very impressed.  brandon took very good care of us the whole night.  we were never rushed and the food just keep coming.  the <mark>Chopped Salad</mark> was great along with the <mark>Stuffed Mushrooms</mark>.   dinner was <mark>Baked Eggplant Parmesan</mark>, salmon, chicken picata and sausage with gnocchi which all were excellent.  one of our diners had some dietary issues and they were very attentive to her.  dessert was amazing my favorite being the apple pie.  everyone in our party was very impressed!", 
            "came here two nights ago to celebrate my besties birthday. i love that you can take an elevator from the parking lot directly to the restaurant, so gangster. the restaurant's view is gorgeous and the ambiance has a sexy feel to it. the only thing i was not a fan of was the red and white checkered table cloths. such a beautiful dining room overlooking the strip, soothing jazz music playing in the background with those table cloths...\n\n\nour server was very friendly, down to earth and attentive. our orders came out surprisingly fast, as an appetizer we had the <mark>Stuffed Mushrooms</mark>, we loved it. i ordered the <mark>Baked Eggplant Parmesan</mark> which was very tasty as well, italian food when cooked properly is very comforting. also another thing that i really enjoyed and just shows how well the kitchen is run, was that the bread for the table came out very warm . i hate going to a restaurant and they serve you cold bread. \n\noverall it was a great experience! lovely restaurant, nice atmosphere, genuine service, good italian food and convenient parking.", 
            "oh no, maggiano's, what is happening to you?  this used to be a great place to eat, with delicious food, wine, good atmosphere and service.  sadly, about a year ago when i was in lv and i ate there with my partner the food was just ok and we felt it was overpriced for the quality. i felt the same when i was there again last october.  still, i have eaten there almost every trip i take to lv so i went again a few days ago. this time, yikes!  i ordered the <mark>Baked Eggplant Parmesan</mark> and i could barely eat it.  i wonder if it was stored in the kitchen for a while or what, because i could only eat a few bites.  it was sitting on top of spaghetti which was (weird and tasted) just ok.  before my main meal i had tomato bisque soup which was very salty.  i was so disappointed in the meal.  my waiter was rather scattered.  i had to ask him four times for some butter for my bread. i will say he was friendly and did his best.  i think he could tell i did not like the food as he did give me some lemon cookies from their bakery when i asked for my check.  i will say those were delicious, but i wasn't there for cookies.  i don't think i will come back to eat at maggiano's unless the locals tell me that the restaurant has improved and is back on track. i'm sad to give this review as i really used to love maggiano's, and that is why it gets two stars instead of one.   :-(", 
            "we were looking for a good, but not exorbitantly priced italian dinner on the strip after the cirque du soleil show at treasure island and maggiano's (open until 11) did not disappoint.  the food was excellent, the quantities generous, the atmosphere upscale but not formal, and the service both courteous and efficient.  the three of us were uniformly pleased with our respective selections: chicken, spinach and ricotta stuffed manicotti for me, <mark>Baked Eggplant Parmesan</mark> with gluten free pasta for norm, and i believe \"traditional home-style lasagna for dennis, a favorite of the philly native.\n \nour meals were preceded by warm, soft and delicious house-baked bread accompanied with olive oil, which we determined not to over indulge in in anticipation of the main dishes of reportedly large portions, which again, did not disappoint in either quality or quantity. \n\nmy manicotti rested in on a pool of delicious and thankfully not nauseatingly rich asiago cream sauce, a 4-lactaid event of potential dairy disaster, especially as it was determined early on there would be no leftovers, but all settled just fine and i don't regret one rich delicious bite or spooning up the remaining asiago sauce after the entr\\u00e9e was gone.  my meal came in at a very reasonable (especially for  the strip) $18.50 plus $6.50 spinach side salad with pine nuts, a not-overpowering smattering of red onion, applewood smoked bacon, a white balsamic vinaigrette, and blue cheese,  i loathe bleu cheese but had mistaken it on sight for feta, and the salad did not suffer for its removal. regrettably there was no room for dessert. \n\nservice was polite, efficient, and more than reasonably attentive.  my iced tea and water glasses never stayed low for long.  our total for 3, including wine, beer, and my tea and side salad came in at i believe under $100, which we agreed was very reasonable given the location, quality, quantity, service, atmosphere and ambiance.  \n\nwe were surprised to learn this restaurant is part of a modest sized chain of maggiano's little italy restaurants, and grateful to find out they have one comparatively near us in phoenix, over in scottsdale.  given distances (and our budgets!), maggiano's won't be a regular dining destination for us, but it will be a special one.  if all locations are as good as this one, we collectively highly recommend."

            "so my parents were in town visiting and my dad loves italian food. we were on the strip and i remembered hearing about this place, so we decided to give it a try. this place definitely has some old world charm, it feels a bit like dining at your nonna's house. in typical strip fashion there were some people in prom style dresses and others in basketball shorts, i love las vegas! the place is huge and we were seated in a booth that felt a bit claustrophobic. we tried to maneuver the table a bit, but it was a tight fit even for me, and i am pretty small. regardless, it was a bustling saturday night and we were seated within a few minutes and our waiter promptly appeared at our table.\n\nof course we started with the bread and it was delicious. i always appreciate olive oil and balsamic with a warm and chewy piece of bread. after checking out the portion sizes on other tables, i opted for a <mark>Grilled <mark>Chicken Caprese</mark> Salad</mark>, figuring i could scavenge off of everyone else's plates. the slices of tomato and mozzarella were quite large, i like mine to be a bit more dainty, but they actually had great flavor and it hit the spot for me. i usually add salt to my caprese, but in this case it was perfectly seasoned. my husband ordered the rigatoni d, which features chicken, mushrooms, and caramelized onions all tossed in a creamy marsala sauce. it was definitely delicious! i appreciated that the chicken had flavor on its own and each element really brought something to the dish. it was even better reheated the next day! my dad had the <mark>Taylor Street Baked Ziti</mark> and it was also well done. it had a great tomato flavor with a hint of sausage. i stole a little plate and also reheated it the next day for dinner. my mom had the lasagna and it was pretty good. i feel like lasagne is a dish that everyone makes at home and isn't very difficult to make, and they had a pretty standard version. \n\ni was very surprised with how well we ate and even more surprised to learn that this is a chain restaurant. it made my picky dad happy and i would definitely return. it is not the best italian food in town, but not bad if you're in the mall or on the strip and want a good meal at a decent price.", 
            "best italian food i've ever had* (and i'm italian!)\n\nevery time my girlfriends and i visited las vegas we would come here at least twice (over a week holiday) to have dinner. i love that the restaurant serves up food family style (read: larger portions meant to be shared among family and/or friends) which is how italian people serve their meals at home to their own families. \n\nthe food is authentic, delicious and the servers always know their s***. i usually go for appetizers (caprese, <mark>Crispy Zucchini Fritt</mark>, mozzerella marinara)  and a main (ravioli, <mark>Baked Eggplant Parmesan</mark>, manicotti). one of my friends always raves about the <mark>Taylor Street Baked Ziti</mark>. \n\none of the best parts is that every time you ordered a main you could get a side of your choice of pasta  (from a list) with a choice of sauce for an extra 1 or 2$. we used to get this to go and eat it poolside the next afternoon for lunch. cheap (sweet, more shopping!) and delicious!!!! i even brought some home on the flight for friends and family once. \n\n*obviously not counting my relatives home-made italian cooking. and the food is on par with the food served at terroni in toronto, canada.", 
            "the service was okay, had to ask the waiter for a refill on water after waiting nearly 10 minutes. the calamari was soggy but the portion was large. the tomato and basil soup was eh, but the <mark>Taylor Street Baked Ziti</mark> wasn't bad.", 
            "came for a bachelorette party dinner.  there was about 10 in our group and opted for the family style menu.  we chose the classic menu which came with a choice of 3 appetizer or salad, 4 main courses, and 2 desserts.  from what i remember, we had the calamari which was amazing, the bruschetta which was also amazing, and the <mark>Maggiano's Salad</mark> the salad was pretty good.  for our main courses, we had the chicken parm. i was not really a fan of this dish just because if was overly breaded.  we also had the peppercorn crusted sirloin.  this dish was really good. the meat was tender and the flavors were good.  along with our meat dishes, we ordered <mark>Taylor Street Baked Ziti</mark> and <mark>Fettuccine Alfredo</mark>.  i enjoyed the <mark>Taylor Street Baked Ziti</mark> but the <mark>Fettuccine Alfredo</mark> was too much on the thick side where the noodles clump up together.  the dessert we chose are tiramisu and creme brulee both were yummy. the creme brulee was on the little runny side but it was a really good runny kind.  there were so much food that we even had tons for left overs.  everyone enjoyed their food before food coma sets in. \n the service was very very very good.  the host was able to hold our table even past the 15 min hold time because our party was so late.  our wait staff was so friendly and soft spoken.  she was attentive but not annoying.  she approached our table frequently but not too frequent.  drinks were refilled  before they  even reached half way.  overall, it was a great experience.  i would recommend this place for big groups who has a budget because to be honest restaurants at vegas can get super expensive and not everyone can afford them.  would i come here again??? of course!! i am actually planning on having my family  bday dinner at the one in la.", 
            "we went yesterday for my sisters birthday and we ordered from the lunch family style menu which is basically buffet style.  \n\nthe last time we were here were a few years ago and it seems like they changed up the menu because we were able to chose more dishes before and now we are limited to 1-2 items per category.  \n\nso you get to chose 1 salad, 1 appetizer, 2 pastas and 2 desserts for $23 per person (it use to be 2 for each i believe - my aunt was really disappointed).\n\nthey come out with the first plate and if you want more, you order 2nd or 3rd's according to how many people want extra.  (they do allow for you to take things home but they've become quite strict on finishing the first plate first).  \n\nthey do have gluten-free penne pasta so i was able to eat that.  \n\nwe ordered the <mark>Caesar Salad</mark>, calamari, clams and linguine, gluten free <mark>Taylor Street Baked Ziti</mark>, tiramisu, and the double fudge brownie.\n\nthe salad was a huge let down - the lettuce was super soggy.\nthe calamari was awesome, light batter and fried to perfection.\neveryone who had the clams said the first dish was too salty and the second dish that came out was way better.\nthe <mark>Taylor Street Baked Ziti</mark> had sausage in it and i usually love sausage but i didn't care for theres.  \nthe tiramisu was delicious and the brownie dish came with ice cream and strawberries.  my nephew and i had the strawberries while everyone else ate the super chocolatey brownie.\n\nit was nice to get together with family and eat a buffet without having to get up.  our server was nice but could have came around just a tab bit more.", 
            "incredible flavors, incredible atmosphere and incredible service await you where italian cuisine is done just right. from the starter bread to your meal, everything is prepared and presented at this location with tantalizing beauty.\n\nmy <mark>Taylor Street Baked Ziti</mark> was warm, flavorful and perfectly cheesy. tasted just great without sausage. :) mom's spaghetti was just as phenomenal, with rich marinara and basil. so even if you play it safe and stick with spaghetti, you'll still have an unforgettable experience.\n\nour host kevin was down-to-earth and engaging. and we went in an hour and a half before closing. with a great view of the fashion show mall and the wynn to top it all off. :) bartender was just as spectacular. \n\na little pricey (plates start at about $15), but well worth it as it tastes better than buca and olive garden combined. portions are hefty too. if its within your budget, give this maggiano's a try!"

            "after a long hard day of shopping, i wandered upstairs to a restaurant called maggiano's.  i am so happy i did!  the restaurant itself sounded familiar but i knew i had never dined there before.  \n\nour server daniel was very attentive and personable, it was my first visit to las vegas so he pointed out many things that we could do in our spare time.  this restaurant had a great view.  you could see las vegas blvd, people shopping, or other diners just like me.  everyone around us seemed to be enjoying their experience at maggiano's and we were definitely enjoying ourselves!\n\nwe started our dining experience with the bruschetta.  it was definitely some of the best bruschetta i have ever had.  i make a pretty killer bruschetta and i was extremely impressed with shredded chunks of parmesan covering the top of the bruschetta.  splendido!!  the bruschetta was served on italian garlic bread that was topped with a tomato bruschetta relish made of tomatoes, balsamic vinegar, and roasted garlic.\n\nwe also ordered: the <mark>Chopped Salad</mark>, the <mark>Tuscan Chicken Sausage</mark> & orzo soup, and the <mark>Fettuccine Alfredo</mark>.  the <mark>Chopped Salad</mark> was very good.  i ordered it without green onions.  the salad ingredients were iceberg lettuce, tomatoes, blue cheese, avocado, and prosciutto tossed in a house dressing.  most of the items on the menu, they give you the option to order half or the full portion.  believe me when i say half is plenty when you want to eat more than just one thing.  i ordered the whole <mark>Chopped Salad</mark> and it was really big.  the <mark>Tuscan Chicken Sausage</mark> & orzo soup contained <mark>Gnocchi & Italian Sausage</mark>, fennel, white beans and tomatoes.  it was really tasty.  the <mark>Fettuccine Alfredo</mark> was delicious!  it was prepared with broccoli and garlic in a creamy alfredo sauce.  we only ordered the half portion of that as well and it was really large.\n\noverall my experience at maggiano's was great from start to finish.  our waters were never left empty, and our server was always around if we needed anything.  it seemed like all the servers we saw there were on top of their game waiting tables because you never saw a table that needed anything that they couldn't ask the server for.\n\nif you around the fashion show mall and you spot maggiano's on the 2nd floor, you should definitely wander up there and grab a bite to eat because i assure you it will be worth it.  i will definitely wander back into a maggiano's even if its not in las vegas.\n\ncheers and enjoy!", 
            "very predictable and reliable.  my husband and i have dined at maggiano's in san jose (santana row) near our house several times and also in orlando florida.  we decided for our last night in vegas we wanted something affordable, reliable and relatively quick- we had show tickets and had gotten back late from our tour.\n\nthe concierge at encore called to get us a reservation and we were seated right at our reservation time (we got there early just in case), but we had plenty of time without feeling rushed.  we ordered the mozzarella appetizer, which was delicious.  husband has his green salad and of course the fresh bread with oil and balsamic vinegar is a huge hit!   an affordable bottle of wine to share and for entrees, my fish loving husband actually ordered the beef tips!  he said they were wonderful and they came with mashed potatoes with shoestring onion ring crisps- bit he was too full to eat the sides.   i ordered the <mark>Fettuccine Alfredo</mark> and it was delicious! \n\nwe passed again on dessert- simply no room because the food during dinner was plentiful!     \n\nthe location is very central- right on the corner of the strip across from the wynn hotel- which was perfect for us considering we were staying at encore and had tickets to the show at wynn.    we would definitely go back again!", 
            "i was introduced to this restaurant when i use to work in the oc.  i love this chain compared to olive garden.  every time i have been to a maggiano's whether it is oc or here, i always seem to wait a little.  just my luck probably.  we like the atmosphere and the food is good.  below are the usual that we order:\n\nappetizers: bruschetta, <mark>Stuffed Mushrooms</mark>\npastas: <mark>Spaghetti & Meatball</mark>, <mark>Fettuccine Alfredo</mark>, lasagna\ndesserts: creme brulee, tiramisu\n\npastas are very well prepared as well, but our favorites that keep us coming back are the appetizers and desserts.\n\nthis is definitely one of my favorite restaurants to go to.\n\nthe only thing that was a turn off for us for this location was that the outdoor dining we had to put up with someone that was smoking at a nearby table.  we have kids so this was rather inconvenient.", 
            "i had no idea that the best meal i would eat in las vegas would be at the mall of all places. we had a meal at craftsteak and i'd trade it for the one we had here any day.\n\nour server was a tiny, bubbly blonde who i wish i could have put in my pocket and taken home with me. she was sweet and happy and very personable.\n\nwe ordered an appetizer of and then i had the <mark>Fettuccine Alfredo</mark> while my husband ordered linguine and clams with the white sauce. \n\nthe app was simply prepared and just lovely. my alfredo was smooth and creamy. it was very flavorful and not oily at all. the linguine was bursting with clams. nicely prepared with most of the clams tossed in with the pasta and a handful still in shells scattered over top. the wine sauce was fantastic.\nwe also had red wine which was their special house red blend. also excellent!\n\nwe were completely stuffed and declined dessert, but our awesome waitress showed us that they serve little mini desserts for just $2.50... i went with the chocolate cake and my husband got the crem\\u00e9 br\\u00fbl\\u00e9e. they were both, of course, to die for. so good!\n\nin the end i found myself not wanting to go back to the hotel and leaving the lovely atmosphere (with lots of frank sinatra playing in the background) and warm, comfortable interior of the restaurant. it was just lovely.\n\nlike i said, best meal we had the whole trip!",

            "again, not impressed, although my dinner experience was a thousand times better than my solo lunch experience. i am not willing though to rate to a higher level as this dinner on many levels fell flat. i should have known, but kept my hopes up none the less. my husband and i were invited to a date night dinner here, so we went along for the ride.\n\nfirst off, service was a tad better this time around. our waiter was a bit of an odd-ball though. i have to give him props for getting me a cocktail in just in time for the happy hour price. he was also incredibly knowledgeable about the restaurant's extensive menu. happily telling us all kinds of things, including his opinion of the marsala sauce that is very unlike his italian grandmothers.\n\nappetizers:\n\n<mark>Calamari Fritt</mark>, served with marinara. it was fried calamari. luckily though it was not soggy or gross. it was fried up nicely and with a spritz of lemon and a bit of the sauce was a decent app. \n\nspinach & artichoke <mark>Mushroom Ravioli al Forno</mark> - i am a fan of artichokes in apps. my favorite though it basically just grilling the artichoke and serving it to me as is. however, i was not impressed with this dip. it is baked in an asiago and alfedo-like cheese sauce and it just did not have any zing to make it any better than any other spinach dip i have had.\n\ncrab & shrimp cannelloni ($18.50) - ugh! what a waste of money. this dish came out in a pool of cheese sauce. literally, the entire plate was cheese sauce. the menu description says this, \"asiago cheese sauce and breadcrumbs\". no. there were no breadcrumbs. my plate was a goopy pile of cheese sauce, with three lone cannellonis that had, perhaps, 4-5 pieces of shrimp. the peppers included did not enhance the meal one bit. the cannelloni was soggy and unappetizing and the crab meat inside was like a wet mop, just smooshy and gross. i was incredibly disappointed in this dish.\n\ni wish i had gotten the spaghetti and meat sauce, which is what my husband got, and he cleaned his plate!\n\ncreme brulee ($7.95) - a huge portion of creme brulee served in a trough. okay, i'm just kidding it wasn't served in a trough, but it might as well have been. the dessert portions are large, so ya know, share. my husband had one spoonful of the creme brulee and i was left to eat the rest of it.\n\nagain, as an overall opinion - it's over-priced, over-salted, overly-hyped italian food on the strip. it's a chain italian restaurant i will continue to avoid.", 
            "let me start by saying we sat at the bar because the restaurant was very busy and ere glad we did ... outstanding service! to the food i had chicken & shrimp <mark>Mushroom Ravioli al Forno</mark> it was outstanding my hubby had the lobster carbonara nothing left on his plate and he also finished mine ,no room for dessert but the people next to us had cheese cake and look delicious."
