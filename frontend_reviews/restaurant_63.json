            "nobu is easily my favorite place to dine in las vegas.  i've been told their traditional sashimi and nigiri offerings are fresh and tasty, but i wouldn't know, because nobu offers up so many unique south-american influenced japanese dishes that i only order from their special items.  i recommend you do the same; you didn't come to vegas to be boring and unadventurous, so why change now?\r\n\r\nthe star of the menu is the broiled black cod <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark>.  when you go, check with the waiter to see if this dish is available with the phyllo dough wrap; if it is, order it that way and prepare for the best thing to ever enter your mouth.  also great are fresh <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark>, <mark>White Fish <mark>Scallop <mark>Salmon <mark>Oyster <mark>Beef <mark>Yuba Sashimi New Style</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark> sashimi, and <mark><mark>Nobu's Moriawase Sashimi Salad</mark></mark> with matsuhisa dressing.  \r\n\r\nmy rating is 1 star shy of a perfect score only because eating there burns a serious hole in my wallet (this ain't todai after all); if only it were not as expensive, i could go more often to feast on the delicious food.", 
            "fresh <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark>\r\nspicy miso scallop chips\r\ntuna tataki <mark>King Crab with Amazu Ponzu</mark>\r\nblack cod <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark>\r\n<mark>Tenderloin of Beef</mark> \"to-ban\" yaki\r\n\r\nbest. dinner. ever.\r\n\r\noh, and did i mention lindsay lohan with her new hard rock beau and bodyguards. good times!", 
            "i was in vegas this past weekend for a bachelorette party. and when we found out there was a nobu here (see my nyc review since i had been to that one quite a few times), we had to come! i was in charge of the ordering since no one else from the party had been there. \r\n\r\nthe decor is similar to new york's nobu, but not as big and not as nice. the service is not as good but it's vegas so oh well.\r\n\r\nwe ordered:\r\n\r\npeach martini and lychee martini - very good but strong.\r\n\r\n<mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> and ponzu sauce - this was fucking good. one of my friend's doesn't eat sashimi and she loved this dish. (see below for kristine n's review). they prepared it with about 20 pieces of sashimi on the plate for our big party! it was great!\r\n\r\n<mark><mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> Salad</mark> - of course i had to order this! i love the salad dressing. \r\n\r\nmiso black cod - the cool thing about nobu is that because we had a group of 8, they actually cut the fish in chunks and put them individually on little lettuce wraps so it would be easier to eat. this was fantastic and sweet.\r\n\r\nchilean sea bass w/ mushrooms - the bride-to-be is a sea bass connoisseur and she said this was not chilean sea bass, but just regular sea bass. it was still very good though. yummm.\r\n\r\nsquid pasta - i love the squid pasta here. complimented w/ asparagus. i love asparagus!\r\n\r\nrock <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark> - we choose the butter sauce since the other sauces had been a bit spicy. yummy.\r\n\r\n<mark>Bento Box</mark> - flourless chocolate cake with <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark>. this was better than i remembered from nyc. it's not flourless as in a chocolate bar on a plate - it actually does have a cake - souffle texture to it. it was great, and gooey in the middle. \r\n\r\nmango caramel ice-cream dessert - a light but tasty dessert with caramel bits in it.\r\n\r\none of the girls and i are not big seafood fans, but we loved all the dishes here. (see below for kristine n.'s review!) that tells ya something! everyone thoroughly enjoyed this meal which made me happy because i hoped they would trust my judgement in food. =)\r\n\r\nit was nice because they brought out each dish one-by-one so you aren't stuffing your faces all at once. by the end of the dinner, we felt extremely satisfied but not so full we were going to explode.\r\n\r\nyay, for nobu!!!", 
            "nobu is awesome. i've never been to a nobu before until this past weekend when i was in vegas for a bachelorette party. the decor inside the restaurant was pretty nice. service wasn't too bad, but it could have been a pinch better. felt like our waitress was spread out a little too thin and trying to cover too many tables, but when she was around, she gave us the time and explained things pretty thoroughly.\n\nmy favorite dish of the night was the <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> (i normally don't like raw fish, but this one was freaking awesome!), <mark><mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> Salad</mark> (i normally don't eat fields of green salad, but this was an exception!), miso black cod (very yummy), the <mark>Bento Box</mark> dessert was great (esp the chocolate flourless cake which was very soft) and the mango caramel <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark> dessert. the <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark> was lighted flavored mango and there were caramel bits in there that was just great. probably my favorite dessert that i've ever had.\n\noverall the food was fantastic. definitely would head back to nobu again next time i'm in vegas. they're opening one closeby and i'll be definitely dining there in the future.", 
            "nobu is a great place to splurge when you have time and want to have good japanese food.  a few quick notes about how to eat there.\n\n1, i've heard the omikase is excellent. it's a safe way to try a nice selection of things.\n2, be nice to your waiter, and it will make all the difference. in general, be nice to the person that brings you your food, and you'll have a better, healthier, more hygenic meal, but here, being nice can mean great service, good advice, and a wonderful experience. i have 1 friend who is a waiter there, and if he can't serve me when i go, i make sure one of the other folks who has helped him wait on me before is my waiter, and i've never had a bad meal, bad location, or bad service.\n3, the black cod <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark>, and hamachi <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> and ponzu are  musts on the menu. i also recommend the squid pasta, rock <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark>, <mark><mark>Nobu's Moriawase Sashimi Salad</mark></mark>, and spicy <mark>Big Eye Tuna Roll</mark>.  the spicy <mark>Big Eye Tuna Roll</mark> there is the best version i've ever had.  the black cod is probably the best treatment of cooked fish i've ever consumed.\n4, enjoy the celebrity spotting. i actually sat next to wayne brady (a very nice guy, and super polite to the staff) at one dinner, and tiffany amber thiessen was there a different night. i can't say the same nice things about her that i mentioned about wayne brady.\n\nall in all, a great meal.  and get the nigori sake...best bang for your buck alcohol wise, and very tasty.", 
            "i was really ready to give nobu an average rating - how much can you really pay for fish?  how good could it really be?  it really is that good.\n\ni was in vegas for a bachelorette party <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> girlfriends, and we went to nobu.  i'd been to nobu next door ages ago in nyc...and i thought it was good but not outstanding.  apparently they save the good stuff for the \"real\" restaurant.\n\ni was underwhelmed by the resaurant decor - it seemed a little bit like any generic japanese restaurant.  but the food was awesome.  we had the tuna <mark><mark>Nobu's Moriawase Sashimi Salad</mark></mark> - tuna was so good and the salad dressing was awesome (i love japanese salad dressing), hamachi <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> peppers, salmon sashimi with chives (loved it - and i'm not even a huge salmon fan), miso cod (liked it...but definitely loved the sashimi more) and the real winner i wasn't expecting was this <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark> dish...  tiny pieces of friend shrimp covered in some sort of mayonnaise-y kind of sauce.  delish.  \nto accommodate some non-fish eaters, we got chicken which was fine, but really, who goes to nobu for chicken?  \n\ni may have to take out a second mortgage on my non-existent house, but it was worth it...", 
            "nobu. . .narcissistic. . .outrageous. . .bracing . . .unconventional.  these are just a few words that come to mind after i experienced nobu. because really, you don't dine or even eat at nobu . . .you experience it with all of your senses. yes, it is expensive, but what do you expect? you're in vegas, a city that thrives on the temptation and transiency of money. \n\nit is glaringly obvious that the chefs at nobu approach sushi and food like art. from the flawless presentation of each plate to the masterful blending of the phenomenal flavors, dining here is like watching art unveil itself. i tasted unique creations at nobu that i have never tasted before anywhere else, nor will i probably ever come across again except at this restaurant. every time a new plate arrived at our table, i felt like applauding (and in many instances, we did). i can not even begin to describe the parade of culinary wonders that we experienced. there was hamachi <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark>, kobe beef carpaccio, marinated cod lettuce wraps, and a wide variety of sashimi and rolls that blew your mind (to name a few). each was an explosive fusion of the far east and the rest of the world that stimulated your taste buds. they also have an impressive selection of flavored sake that only serves to emphasize the aromatics of the food.\n\nnot only is nobu candy for your soul, it is candy for the eyes as well. don't be surprised if you dine next to an unshaven justin timberlake, bitchy paris hilton, drunk vince vaughn or bald britney spears. just remember to play it cool, you are at nobu after all.", 
            "more like 3 1/2 stars.  i've been to the ny and miami ones, and this is 2nd behind nyc.  good food and service for the most part.  \nfresh <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> - yum, though presentation was better at nyc\nrock <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark> <mark>King Crab with Amazu Ponzu</mark> and chili pepper - yum\n<mark>King Crab Ceviche</mark>- yum\n<mark>Creamy Spicy Crab</mark> - doubt this is authentic but if you love mayo like i do...yum\nwashu beef - served <mark>White Fish <mark>Scallop <mark>Salmon <mark>Oyster <mark>Beef <mark>Yuba Sashimi New Style</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark> - like a carpaccio drizzled with sesame oil - yum\n\nthis is where i would take points away:\n-the space is not that impressive for the prices\n-bathroom being way back out in the casino.  every food establishment should have a convenient place to wash your hands!\n-uni was so--- not fresh,  it was bitter!  though as soon as i mentioned it, the waiter took it off our bill.  i'm just surprised a place of this caliber would serve anything with poor quality.\n-though i expect the specials to be pricey, it would be courteous to mention to a party of two that one of them is $120!", 
            "when nobu opened in new york city, it created a sensation.  reservations were nearly impossible to get, and its new interpretation of traditional japanese food was widely praised.  this led to the inevitable branding of the restaurant; nobu can be found all over the globe.\n\nmeal #1: i found las vegas nobu's sushi highly variable.  the overall quality was ok, but some items (e.g., uni) were poor while others (e.g., ankimo) were good.  orange and honey flavored sake was interesting but probably not worth repeating.\n\n\nmeal #2:  since my first meal, i went to nobu in miami beach, sat in the dining room and had the omakase meal.  i enjoyed that a bit more, so decided to give the vegas location another shot.\n\nthe restaurant looks ok, but nothing great.  it's very noisy, in keeping with the hard rock atmosphere.  the crowd is mostly young, but i think anyone would feel comfortable here; i did.  service is pleasant, although all the servers are running around at full speed.\n\nnow, on to the meal:\n\n    * i chose jyunmai daiginjyo sake.  it wasn't bad, but was a trifle harsh.\n    * small japanese spring roll with balsamic vinaigrette reduction.  good.\n    * trio of raw seafood: sea scallop slice, oyster, ama ebi (raw shrimp).  all served with onion and other spices, although each was slightly different.  good.\n    * seared maguro and a slightly strong flavored fish, <mark>Squid 'Pasta' with Light Garlic</mark> chips and a pickled ginger shoot.  a good combination.  very good.\n    * uni (<mark>Sea Urchin</mark>) <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> white fish, served on sliced eggplant.  the uni was seared and was surprisingly delicious.  there was also a tiny river crab, to be eaten shell and all; interesting for the crunch, not the flavor.  very good.\n    * o toro and a spring roll <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> sauce and radish.  the o toro was good but a little chewy, and the strong sauce tended to overwhelm the tuna.  good to very good.\n    * palate cleanser: intensely flavored, sweet/sour mango sorbet, on top of a red granite with little flavor.\n    * service lapse.  up to this point, courses had been timed well.  at this point, i waited for about 15 minutes, with no explanation.  this was a little annoying.\n    * grilled sea scallop on a bed of mushrooms, bits of seafood, and brown rice.  very good.\n    * <mark>Teppan Style Foie Gras</mark> and kobe beef.  a large hunk of <mark>Teppan Style Foie Gras</mark>; good flavor.  kobe beef very good.  overall, very good to excellent.\n    * service lapse: the next course was supposed to be sushi, followed by <mark><mark>Lobster <mark>Miso Soup</mark></mark></mark>.  they reversed the order, and apologized later.  a minor matter.\n    * <mark><mark>Lobster <mark>Miso Soup</mark></mark></mark>.  better than average; good fish stock flavor, not too salty.  very good.\n    * sushi: o-toro (tuna belly), <mark>Shima Aji</mark> (variety of mackerel?), some kind of crab, unagi (eel).  very good.\n    * fruit papillote.  like a crepe.  the raspberry seeds were very distracting.  fair.\n    * honey <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark>.  very strong honey flavor.  strange, but i liked it.  very good.\n\noverall, the meal was good, but not as good as nobu in miami, and not nearly as good as okada.  at the price they charge ($120), they need to do better.\n\n\nmeal #3: based on past meals, i hadn't planned to return. however, i found myself at the hard rock hotel at meal time, and no other choices looked appealing. i decided to go for unusual choices, hoping this would be a strength. this worked out better. my selections:\n\n    * ankimo (steamed monkfish liver). standard but still very good.\n    * <mark>Hamachi Kama</mark> (grilled yellowtail collar). this is a chunk of fish, skin and bone, served grilled. it may not sound like much, and it's a little difficult to get the flesh out, but it's usually very rich and very tasty. i was both happy and sad with my choice: it was very good, but not as good as elsewhere. if you'd like to try this dish, order it robatayaki style at okada.\n    * live shrimp. these santa barbara shrimp were killed in front of me, so i guess that means they're fresh. they were big and rather chewy; i'm guessing the latter is due to their recent demise. the heads were served tempura style, and were juicy and tasty.\n    * live octopus. i'm not sure that it was live, but slices of the tentacle, served raw, were indeed very fresh tasting - and much less chewy than the cooked version. pretty good.\n\nthis was the most satisfying of my meals at nobu. nothing was stellar, but everything was good.\n\n\n\nnobu's strength is its new take on japanese foods.  its weaknesses are sushi that isn't in the same class with the better places in las vegas, and suspect service.  given such high prices, i'd look elsewhere.", 
            "i wish all of my meals in vegas were this good.  i don't even know where to begin.  the yellow tail <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> that i was allowed to taste was delicious.  i could have ordered 5 plates of it alone and been happy with my meal.  thankfully being with the group i was with that wasn't allowed to happen and i enjoyed several other items from the menu.\n\nfor myself i ordered the chilean sea bass with a <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark> rub, the <mark><mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark></mark>, uni nigiri, and scallop sashimi.  the sea bass had a very mild flavor although the <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark> was tasty.  i think grilling sea bass rather than steaming it brings out the buttery flavor that it naturally has much better.  the <mark><mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark></mark> was great and i could have had a couple more but i held off so i could enjoy my entire meal.  the uni was good, although i don't think the wait staff would be able to tell you whether the uni is good that day or not if you asked.  i'm sure the people preparing the meals would just opt not to serve the uni if they happen to not be able to get some good stuff in that day.  at least i hope so.  the surprise of the meal was the scallop sashimi. it was presented beautifully in a little hollowed out lime cup.  with a dash of soy and wasabi the flavor was amazing.  i really should have gotten at least one more order.\n\ni was also able to try some of the tempura rock shrimp, miso black cod, and the wagyu beef.  all were great but the wagyu beef and miso black cod were crazy delicious and will be must order items the next time i eat at nobu.\n\nfor dessert i had the hibiscus sorbet with champagne jelly and rock candy.  the popping of the rock candy (pop rocks) in your mouth with the flavor of the hibiscus sorbet and champagne jelly was more fun than some of the yelp events i've been to.", 
            "if you can manage to get a reservation, do not pass this place up.  it is the best sushi that i've ever had outside of japan.  in fact, they actually fly the fish in fresh from japan every single day.  \n\nmy menu recommendations -- ie get these three things or don't bother going at all -- are the miso eggplant, the <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> and cilantro in yuzu sauce, and the thinly sliced white fish in ponzu sauce.  though i have extensive experience with the nobu menu, in my opinion these three dishes are the most outstanding options on the menu.  now when i go to nobu, i gorge myself by ordering multiples of just these three dishes.\n\ni also recommend their restaurant beer brand.  it's lighter and more crisp than most japanese beer, and in fact, tastes more like a chinese beer to me.", 
            "if we overlook the fact that the restaurant wrote down our reservation for 10 for the wrong night, my group's dining experience here was exceptional and we were pleased that they were still able to seat us despite this error. the service was incredibly fast (3 people from our group were late and we completely finished our meal by the time they arrived,) and the food was fabulous. the flavors were crisp, unique, and every bite of food was like an explosion in my mouth. since we shared all the dishes we ordered, that pretty much means that we only got one bite so we savored it for all that it was worth. damn you nobu for being so expensive! otherwise i would have ordered 2 of everything!\n\na couple of dishes i would recommend trying are:\n-<mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark>\n-toro tartar <mark>Yellowtail or Salmon <mark>Blue Fin <mark>Toro Tartare</mark> with Royal Ossetra Caviar</mark></mark>\n-black cod <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark>\n-rock <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark>\n-new zealand mussels with the garlic sauce\n\n***the must try dish is the fish/<mark>Lobster <mark>Tuna <mark>King Crab <mark>Vegetable <mark>Salmon Nobu Style Taco</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark>!!!***\nthey are not on the menu here, but you can special order them and they are awesome. i have pictures to prove it.", 
            "amazing!!! were the first words i thought of when i was dining and leaving this restaurant.  my best friend recommended this restaurant as we were planning our vegas trip.  i didn't think much about this place when he brought it up, my expectations were pretty much non-existent.  once we got to the restaurant, it was top notch from start to finish.  we ordered quite a bit of different dishes and it was delicious down to the last bite.  our waiter was quite helpful with our decision making and recommendations.  first dish on our table was the fresh <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark>.  this dish is awesome!  the flavoring along with the fresh yellowtail easily makes this my favorite dish at this restaurant.  we also had the monkfish pate, <mark><mark>Nobu's Moriawase Sashimi Salad</mark></mark>, black cod <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark>, broiled yellowtail collar; <mark>Creamy Spicy Crab</mark>, rock <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark> <mark>King Crab with Amazu Ponzu</mark> and creamy spicy sauce.  all around delicious dishes with great visual presentation.  their lychee martini is also worth a mention, a tasty treat.  i highly recommend this restaurant for those who haven't tried it yet.  this is easily one of my top 10 restaurants.  just a wonderful experience from beginning to finish!",

            "nobu is my favorite japanese restaurant.  ever.  so far i've been to three- this one, nobu malibu and nobu 57 in ny.  out of the three, i'd have to say ny was the best and this one the least-best.  i say \"least best\" because \"worst\" and nobu don't belong in the same sentence together.  you cant go wrong with nobu- but i did have a few gripes about my most recent experience here a couple days ago.\n\nso, of course of course you have to get the miso cod, obvie...not going to spend time describing how fabulous that dish is. in <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> to the cod, i also ordered the lychee martini, the miso eggplant, the <mark>Hearts of Palm</mark> salad with \"jalapeno\" dressing and a <mark><mark>Lobster <mark>Miso Soup</mark></mark></mark>.  if you've read my nobu 57 review, you can see that the lychee martini i had was perfect (which is why i had 3), so understandably i was excited to have it again.  however, the one i received at nobu vegas was waaaaay to strong, and i had to request <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> lychee juice to balance out the rubbing alcohol taste.  my other major gripe was the <mark>Hearts of Palm</mark> salad.  i specifically went out of my way to ask the server if this salad was the same <mark>Hearts of Palm</mark> salad <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> dressing they serve at nobu 57, and he assured me it was.  wrong.  that salad that came out was repulsive- and pretty offensive because of the over-the-top garlic used.  it tasted nothing like the marvelous h.o.p. salad at nobu 57.  and, they should call it \"blast of garlic dressing\" because after one bite i swear i smelled wretchedly of garlic for the rest of the night- and it wasn't spicy from the jalapeno at all.  oh, and not to mention the fact that it was twenty dollars.  um, yea...skip that one.  the miso eggplant was good- not remarkable, but we did eat every last bit of it.\n\nso, even with my complaints i still believe its a 4-star worthy establishment because every one of my previous experiences here have been amazing.  maybe not as good as nobu 57, but still the best japanese restaraunt in vegas, definitely.",

(i don't think i've ever typed a longer word than \"unenthusiastically\").\n\nthe black cod <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark> was the highlight. the kobe beef was amazing too but we all misread the menu and when that showed up at $192 i'd call it hands down the most overpriced thing i've ever eaten. the <mark>Scallop</mark> topped <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> were the third great dish. the sushi was fine though nothing spectacular.\n\nthe ambiance is surprisingly boring, especially for vegas. it looks the way a japanese restaurant might if designed by the high-school drama department - all cheap bamboo reeds and sloppy wood structures. and the service, though efficient, was humorless. any waitress who can't understand the genius in asking if there are any beef-based <mark>Dessert</mark> off the menu is not winning any points with me.\n\nstill, the price minus the kobe was totally reasonable, especially for vegas. and the matsuhisa martinis go a long way toward <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> up to a pretty good meal.", 
            "yellow tail <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark>= out of this world\n\nthe reason why i am giving it a 3 star instead of 5 is because i've been to the malibu location for nobu and it is a lot better. also, there is no bathroom in the restaurant, you have to walk through the casino, through the nasty drunken guys who whistle and harrass you, just so you can go to the bathroom, it makes it hard to enjoy your cocktail during dinner when you know if you gotta go, you'd have to make a journey to find the restroom, and once you're there, there's a huge line full of drunk girls waiting to use the restroom as well. i would think for such a high scale restaurant, that there would at least be a bathroom inside. \n\nother than that.. the food's amazing, the bloodymary was delicious, the sangria was good too! the service is acceptable for the price you are paying for, and it's great because they expanded the place, so there is rarely a wait to be seated. p.s. the dessert is presented really pretty thaty you don't want to ruin it by eating it lol", 
            "i'm not going to lie--a small part of me dies every time i think about how much we spent here.  but the truth of the matter is, you can't get good sushi without paying for it.  \n\nwe ordered the $100 omakase, the uni tempura set, kabocha tempura, and salmon sashimi.\n\nthe fusion dishes (like the hamachi <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> or the snapper with cucumber <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Whole <mark>1/2 Maine Lobster</mark></mark> <mark>Roasted Poussin with Spicy Lemon</mark></mark> juice) were fun to try but i find that the sauces often overpower the fish, which is the best thing about nobu.  if you have never tried any of their signature dishes, you might want to order at least one of the omakase options, but if you're just looking to enjoy the fish qua fish, then order the sashimi and/or nigiri a la carte.\n\nand yes, let's talk about the fish.  i have never had such a wonderfully buttery miso black cod!  and the toro, maguro, aji, trout, and sake (as in salmon sashimi) simply melted in our mouths.  no biting necessary.  the only low point was that the anago in our complimentary sushi was littered with small fish bones but hey, it was complimentary!  yet another reason why i love nobu.  they know how to treat the ladies right.\n\nas for the tempura, the kabocha was out of season, so it was our bad for ordering it in the first place, but the uni tempura was unlike anything i have ever had.  every bite was bursting with succulence and the tempura batter <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> extra texture and flavor.  heavenly.  anyone who is a fan of uni and/or tempura needs to try this!  it also comes with tempura shiitake mushroom (luxuriously juicy), tempura shiso leaf (so crispy, so light), and one other <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark> that i forget but that my mom thought was delicious.\n\nthe dessert was lovely too--we had the <mark>Bento Box</mark> which consists of flourless chocolate cake and homemade green tea <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark>.  not too sweet and the perfect way to end a perfect meal.\n\ni seriously cannot wait to come back here again and try the <mark>Hamachi Kama</mark>, the snapper, the whole fried fish, and the squid salad.  is it expensive?  yes.  but is it worth it?  most definitely.", 
            "wow. i was seriously impressed with this place. this place ranks second to french laundry on my list of favorites. \n\nfirst- if you are a first time visitor there, i would recommend just ordering off of the menu. i am sure the omakase is great but you have to try the signature dishes- and you may not get to try them all with the omakase. \n\nsecond- don't have the sushi be your primary focus. it's okay- but the other items are so much better. we saw people around us doing nothing but order sushi- what a waste! \n\nthird- the warm dishes tended to be larger portions than the cold and raw dishes. just a fyi if you want to budget your appetite and your wallet. i also felt that the dishes with a tart factor (see below) were too overwhelming. i would pass on these- imo the tartness is so much you can't enjoy the other flavors that might be there. \n\nwe started with edammame and the sheshito peppers. pass on the edamamme - there is nothing great about it- and you don't need to fill up your tummy with average stuff. the sheshito peppers were really good. they taste like small green bell peppers and the miso and sesame sauce on top has a great flavor. my husband is so picky when it comes to veggies and he even enjoyed this. my only word of caution- occasionally you get a spicy one! \n\nso we relied on our fellow yelpers and ordered the following items: \n\n1. <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> - definitely get this- it was awesome! \n\n2. the blackened miso cod- by far, the highlight of the evening \n\n3. chilean sea bass- cooked the special of the day way (yummy)- it had tomatoes, and onions, some white wine sauce \n\n4. kobe beef on skewers- pass- it was okay but not great \n\n5. <mark><mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark></mark>- pass- the tartness was way too overwhelming \n\n6. red <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark> - pass- again, tartness too overwhelming \n\n7. then we ordered some basic filler items- tempura, sushi (ca rolls and ama ebi)- all which were fine. \n\n8. we ordered the <mark>Bento Box</mark> dessert- it was ok- not fantastic. \n\noverall- the meal was great. the <mark>Black Cod Miso</mark> cod was so good- it had the right blend of sweetness with saltiness, and the fish was so tender it literally melts in your mouth. the chilean sea bass had the same texture and effect, but it costs about twice the amount as the black cod (a tidbit for those of you who are watching the $$s). \n\nwe had starved ourselves earlier in the day and were totally stuffed by the end of the meal. the whole meal with tip was just over $300. i highly recommend this place. it was the only restaurant that we went to in the older part of vegas that was great.", 
            "this is my second time here and both times i've come with my cousin. as much i love nobu, i only go there with her, since she loves it so much, but i never regret it. \n\nthe nice thing is i just let her order, since she knows what's good, but then if i ever go alone, i won't really know what to order. i did have a nice acai cocktail to start the night. it was delicious and refreshing, great way to start the meal. \n\nwe ordered the <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> which i loved since i love the spice. then we had the seafood spring rolls which weren't on the menu, but since they go there all the time, they knew about it. those were also really good, along with the <mark><mark>Nobu's Moriawase Sashimi Salad</mark></mark>. loved the dressing and there was so much sashimi! we also had the rock <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark>, which was kinda like popcorn shrimp, but really tasty <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> grilled beef thing. \n\nat the end, we ordered the <mark>Bento Box</mark>, which was a flourless chocolate cake with green tea <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark>. everything was really good, but service was a little slow. my other friends were also there and they were a party of 10. they started a little after us but finished before us!! other than that though, it was a great night.", 
            "i was in vegas for my birthday and my friends and i went here for my birthday meal. everything was delicious! my favorites were the yellow tail <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> and the black cod <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark> sauce. amazing! our waiter wasn't very friendly but the food made up for it. i will definitely go again!", 
            "all i have to say is.....\nblack cod with dried miso lettuce wraps =ftw!\n\nmy family decided to go a bit fancy and tried nobu at the hardrock in las vegas and i have to say, \"wow!\"  the food is amazing!  \n\ni have learned that at places like these, you know you are going to spend money.  so, why not eat the \"speciality\" things they are known for rather than food you can always get at another restaurant.  so, i ordered the yellow tail <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark>, the salmon tataki with cilantro dressing, <mark><mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark></mark>, and my favorite thing in the whole wide world= the black cod <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark> lettuce wraps!  \n\nomg!  this fish was amazing.  i didn't want to stop eating the lettuce wrap and never wanted it to end!  \n(i know it sounds very sexual but once you have this dish, you too will feel like you had a sexual encounter in your mouth!  -that's what she said!)\n\ni say if you ever have that one night when you want to go fancy while your in vegas and don't mind spending the money and want a very delicious experience, you need to go to nobu at the hardrock!  \n\nonce again let me say this again!  \nyou have to try the black cod with dried miso lettuce wraps!", 
            "it was saturday night in vegas, we wanted sushi, and nobu didnt even cross my mind until my boyfriend made reservations for the same night. i quickly logged on to yelp to check the latest reviews as i do with any restaurant, and i am happy to say that i am ecstatic i did this, because had i not, i would have missed out on the black cod <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark>.... which is without a doubt, one the best things that i have ever tasted. \n\nmy bf and i shared 4 dishes and 1 dessert, washed it down with 2 sapporo's each, and by the time we were done, we could barely walk!\n\n<mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> - delicious!!!! the sauce may be just a bit overpowering but delicious nonetheless. i couldnt even taste the jalapeno :)\n\n<mark><mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark></mark> - i have no clue why they are calling this \"ceviche\" but i wish we would have ordered something else instead. it was merely ok,  it just kind of tasted like cold <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> lettuce - but hey, i love <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark>  its all good :)\n\nblack cod <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark> - omg - i just got goosebumps thinking about this dish. it is hands down the best thing i have ever put in my mouth. i like how crunchy <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> it is..  delicioso~\n\n<mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark> roll - your basic roll ..  \n\n<mark>Bento Box</mark> dessert ( flourless chocolate cake with green tea <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark>) yum yum yum yum - this is a great combination - not too much,  shared <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> special is a perfect way to satisfy your sweet tooth.\n\nwill definitely come back - loved the all male service - everyone was really nice and our waiter pretty much gave us his thoughts on all the menu items and gave us some nice suggestions - that in hindsight, i should have taken.\n\n but hey, theyre's always next time!!", 
            "yikes, what happened?\n\nconsistency isn't one of nobu's strengths, apparently, which i believe should be a priority if they are going to charge their customers as much as they do.  i ordered the cheaper $100 omakase again (which i do believe is a good deal given the amount of food you get) but the quality of fish has gone downhill since my last visit.\n\nthe signature hamachi <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark>?  devoid of all velvety tenderness.  the salmon sashimi?  like chewing a rug.  the maguro nigiri?  stringy and tough.\n\non top of it all, i ventured out and tried the <mark>Hamachi Kama</mark>.  not bad, but terrible for $20.  in san diego, you can get the same size <mark>Hamachi Kama</mark> with every bite just as, if not more, succulent for $9.  there is no excuse, honestly.  if you are going to charge me $20, you better make sure not a single sliver of white meat is dry.  half the fish was, but luckily there was dipping sauce to keep the meat from being unbearable to the palate.\n\nnobu isn't a complete loss, though.  like i stated before, the omakase is a great deal, price wise.  it comes with the famed bento dessert, which was even better than i remembered it being last time.  we also tried the miso almond cake and edamame <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark>, which was great in that it was unique and creative (the taste, quite honestly, was *salty*), but it all paled in comparison with the flourless chocolate cake crowned in green tea <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark> that is the bento.  never be tempted to order a different dessert here at nobu.  ever.\n\nsame goes with the black cod.  yes, it's small and yes, it's expensive if you order it a la carte, but it's worth every luscious bite.  it should be a must-order if you come here (it comes with the omakase, but it's so good, you should probably just order another).\n\none item not part of the omakase menu is the uni tempura set.  perhaps the deep frying hides any flaws in the uni, but i could taste that warm sweet flavor that i know is associated with high quality freshness.  gotta love the juicy mushroom and refreshing shiso that comes with it too.  the set is also accompanied with a set of delightful salts, all used to enhance in my opinion, what needs no enhancement.  still nice to look at, though, and they make for some good pictures!\n\ni also tried one of the eponymous sakes and was impressed.  can't remember which one, but the price was reasonable.  wonderfully smooth and paired well with the fish.  i highly recommend that you get it served hot.\n\nwhile i maintain an a-ok for nobu, i doubt i'll be coming back.  there are other places to get better japanese food--and for better prices.", 
            "i only had the sushi so i can't review the hot dishes, so here it goes. the <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> and yuzu was by far the best and the <mark>Nobu Crispy Rice with Big Eye Tuna</mark> <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark> shrimp were good as well, but not worth twice the price of a decent sushi place. i don't know what exactly i was expecting, but this definitely fell short.\n\nalthough the cucumber lychee martini was delicious. i would come back to try the hot dishes if someone else was picking up the tab, otherwise i think pink taco would probably be just as satisfying.\n\noh and i really wasn't that impressed with the decor, why is bamboo so luxe?", 
            "after being seated, our table was presented a single drink menu, and left alone for fifteen minutes. our waiter seemed a little miffed when he asked what we were going to start with to drink and i told him that we'd like to see food menus. i found it presumptuous and manipulative to leave us with a drink menu and that much free time. we are in vegas, i know, but when you're willing to pay for a nice meal, i expect a little more tact on behalf of the servers.\n\nour waiter was also very quick to tell us how he thought we should move through the menu, all the while, mispronouncing common japanese dishes.\n\nwe tried a number of different dishes and rolls from the blue fin toro to <mark>Spicy Miso Chips <mark>Nobu Crispy Rice with Big Eye Tuna</mark> or <mark>Scallop</mark></mark>, <mark>Fresh Water Eel</mark>, albacore, and <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark>. everything was... good. not impressive, certainly not memorable... just good.\n\nthe interior of this location was bland. one of my co-workers mentioned that the decoration on the walls looked like large ironing boards, which was a fair assessment. the main dining area was too bright for a comfortable dinner, and had us sitting around the kind of small, wood topped table you might find yourself at while having lunch at your favorite sandwich shop.\n\nthe banana cake <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> cream <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark> was a high note, although the spoonful <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark> that they tried to pass off as a scoop made me feel like i was caught in a scene from american psycho. \n\nfor all the noise i heard about nobu being something special, i left feeling uninspired, and with a reminder to myself why finding those one of a kind, family run japanese restaurants is such a treat.", 
            "if it were only about the sushi, nobu would get 5 stars from me. but, i knock off 2 stars for service. we walked in on a saturday night and got seats at the sushi bar, which is the place to be. we went with our sushi chef's suggestions, which were nobu's <mark>House Special</mark>, including \"new-style sashimi.\" these consist of the best fish, <mark>White Fish <mark>Scallop <mark>Salmon <mark>Oyster <mark>Beef <mark>Yuba Sashimi New Style</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark>, with delicate sauces and garnishes: <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark>, live octopus with a peruvian chili paste, whitefish and salmon <mark>King Crab with Amazu Ponzu</mark> sauce, tuna <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark>-mustard sauce. everything was first-class, including the junmai daiginjo sake.\n\nthen, i ordered the <mark>Bento Box</mark> chocolate cake dessert. we were told it would take 8 minutes to cook. no problem - our bellies were happily full of sashimi. 20 minutes later, however, still no dessert, and we finally were able to flag someone down to check on it. another ten minutes went by. our waiter then came out to tell us there was a mixup in the kitchen and our cake went to another table. he tried to give us a plateful <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark> to tide us over - this didn't go over well, as the last thing we wanted was to eat a plateful <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark> and then a chocolate cake. another ten minutes or so, the dessert came out. it was excellent, but frankly wasn't worth waiting over half an hour for. we ask ed for the check while still eating...took another ten minutes...gave the credit card and another ten minutes went by...waiter came out to tell us the credit card isn't clearing and do we want to give another card? by this point, well over an hour had gone by since dessert was ordered and we just wanted to leave already. \n\nwhen our check finally arrived, they did charge us for the dessert that took over 30 minutes to arrive at our table. when i mentioned this to the server, he took it right off the bill. but i was miffed that i even had to ask - the right thing to do would have been to take it off in the first place.\n\ntoo bad, since up until we ordered dessert we were very pleased with the sushi our wonderful chef served us. even for a saturday night in vegas, the service was unacceptably unresponsive for such a high-end restaurant.", 
            "<mark>Black Cod Miso</mark>, <mark>Black Cod Miso</mark>, <mark>Black Cod Miso</mark> that is all you really need to know. we also had yellowtail shashimi <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> which was very good as well. however, nothing touches the <mark>Black Cod Miso</mark>. cons - the place is very loud. hard rock hotel is the loudest hotel/casino in all of vegas so it is a bit of a given that a place inside would be loud as well. the staff is a bit ridiculous but we just chalked it up to that being part of the show. the staff will try and strong arm you into letting them order for you. just stand your ground and go for what you want. also, they will offer you an $11 bottle of fiji water right off the bat. smile and refuse and get some free tap water instead.\npros - have i mentioned the <mark>Black Cod Miso</mark>? the best thing i have ever had pass my lips. the people watching is top notch really every meal on a vegas vacation should be a dinner and a show. the show at nobu is one of the best. with the spouse swapping to my left and the wrestling over who picked up the check to my 1 o'clock (no kidding a half nelson and a headlock/nuggie was used) i was laughing a majority of the time. some people should not have saki. the food is the main reason this place rocks as, it should be. everything else is just a distraction.", 
            "i spent a week in las vegas at the hard rock hotel for nye this year. it was not my first visit to nobu, so we were very much looking forward to a meal there.\n\nas always, it was fantastic. the cucumber martini was so very refreshing i am still craving it. the yellow tail <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> has the best citrus soy sauce - we actually came back & got a drink & this dish again before we went out another night because it was so good & light. we also had the <mark>Lobster <mark>Tuna <mark>King Crab <mark>Vegetable <mark>Salmon Nobu Style Taco</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark> which were great.\n\nfor hot dishes, we had the rock <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark> <mark>King Crab with Amazu Ponzu</mark> sauce and the black cod <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark>. can you say melt in your mouth? this is the reason i return to nobu again & again.",

            "before the concert started at the hard rock, i had enough time to sit down and have a fabulous dinner. at first i thought that steak might be a good idea, but i love asian food and wanted a great experience. my boyfriend and i walked into nobu, a japanese restaurant. for our first time there, we decided to ask for assistance with the menu, and chose several things from each part.\n\ntheir menu is broken up by sushi, cold, hot and specialties. we decided to go with a little bit of everything.\n\nour favorite was the <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark>, and the crab tempura with their special sauce. their tempura shrimp and <mark>Vegetable</mark> were great also.\n\noverall, for the price of 266 dollars for two people to eat out of a tasting menu, it was a great experience. i can't say much about their food because i have to say that i've eaten better tempura at our local asian restaurant, well being in the box.\n\nalthough their tempura was okay (it was too soft and not crispy at all), their sushi was as close to the guam experience as we could get. it was sweet, done perfect, and the sauces were impeccable.\n\ni honestly didn't feel that their tempura was worth the 200 dollar ticket. that was majority of our bill. i do believe that their signature <mark>Bento Box</mark> dessert was worth 14 dollars. it was creamy, a perfect souffle, and their green tea <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark> was just like home.\n\nif you want something other than tempura for your experience at nobu, it's worth the price tag and the trip. for myself, a good japanese restaurant serves light, crispy, and fluffy tempura the way i've had it in japan and on guam from top japanese chefs. however, this was not the case, unfor<mark>Tuna (Big Eye)</mark>.\n\ni give this restaurant my personal 3/5 stars.", 
            "i don't know about the ny or la counterparts, but......\n\nnobu lv must be the biggest scam in the history of fine dining.  i really wanted to like it because i didn't want to seem like a hater but seriously the decor is so uninspired (surfboards, bamboo, modern-classic clash) and the wait staff doesn't have the same refined elegance or grace as comparably priced restaurants.  just cuz you put on a black t-shirt and black slacks doesn't make it chic and modern -- unless you're steve jobs.\n\nwe had the <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> which was genius -- at least for the accountants.  the live scallop was sour and spicy but just too much of each.  the moi new sashimi special could have been any fish.  the miso cod was tasty and one of the highlights, but was served lukewarm.  the uni tempura dish was also pretty good but you only get 1 piece of uni.  the <mark>Bento Box</mark> and yuzu wasabi <mark>Dessert</mark> were ok too.\n\nwould i dine there if the food was 1/3 the price?  sure.  i just felt like i was getting duped and i wanted to scream out the king ain't wearing any clothes you idiots.  but then i realized between the loud noise of hard rock and the drunken stupor of the crowd , my efforts would be moot.",

            "this was my first of many trips to nobu restaurants. the hot and cold dishes are very good and innovative. i could pass on the sushi there as i find it to not be up to par for their prices. my favorite dish there is the <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark>. so simple yet so delicious. the miso cod is also delicious but everyone does that dish. also try their matsuhisa martini. it has ginger <mark>Eel and Cucumber</mark> infused vodka and is very refreshing.\n\ni secretely made it my goal to eat at every nobu worlwide. they need to stop opening new ones because i'm falling behind.", 
            "every detail was covered, from a rich broth of <mark><mark>Lobster <mark>Miso Soup</mark></mark></mark> with clams to lovely service from a friendly server. he was really informative and helped us pick through the menu. the interior is contemporary japanese and beautiful. and the food was fantastic.\n\nwe had a tasty hamachi <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> slices. i've had this dish at other places but nobu slices the jalapenos paper thin and dresses the fish in a fantastic sauce. their rendition also includes a cilantro leaf and i'm a huge fan of the herb. great balance of flavors and quality of fish.\ntuna <mark><mark>Nobu's Moriawase Sashimi Salad</mark></mark>. this is a mountain of crisp salad with the sashimi draped around the base. it's a little technically difficult to eat because i wasn't sure how to get it all in one bite. but the salad was delicious and the tuna was, of course, amazing.\nblue fin toro <mark>Yellowtail or Salmon <mark>Blue Fin <mark>Toro Tartare</mark> with Royal Ossetra Caviar</mark></mark>. i think toro needs to be eaten as sashimi/nirigi or over rice as chirashi. mincing it up seems wrong.\n\nand the highlight was the <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> dish with seven spices and liberal amounts of clarified butter. holy gawd!! this was fantastic!! it was an explosion of flavors in your mouth and utterly, indescribably delicious. they split the <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> in half, cook the meat in large chunks, and then place it back into the shell. it makes for a beautiful presentation yet the tender chunks of meat are easy to remove and eat.\n\ninterestingly, i've been to other nobu restaurants and the menu is strikingly similar. i don't know why, but that seems odd.", 
            "maybe it's becuase i live in a state not known for it's seafood -- but nobu consistently has the best sushi and fish i've ever eaten.     it is the first reservation i make when going to las vegas or dallas for work.  \n\nyep it's pricy but i have dreams about it -- it's that good !!   and i've even paused my television when i saw some psuedo celebs eating there on some reality tv show -- when they were eating my favorite things.\n\nthe trick is really to just get the good stuff -- it's over the top fantastic but when i try new stuff it never quite lives up to the others ..\n\n1,  <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> -- get at least 2 orders -- i could eat 3-4 by myself if i really tried hard.\n\n2.  black cod <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark> -- either version (in lettuce cups or not)\n\n3.   tuna <mark><mark>Nobu's Moriawase Sashimi Salad</mark></mark> -- yum !!!\n\n4.   any other sushi -- but if you get rolls - i suggest you pay extra for rice paper instead of seaweed (did this cuz one friend is allergic to seaweed and it makes the fish stand out).\n\n5.  rock shrimp\n\n6.  <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark>\n\n7.  <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark>\n\n8.   <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark>\n\n9.   <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark>\n\n10.  <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> \n\n(did you get it yet ???)\n\nand the service is always top notch !!!    attentive and knowledgeable ....   and the drinks are fantastic too !\n\nit is a spendy dinner -- but in my opinion -- totally worth it !!!", 
            "i can't believe it took so long for a foodie like me to eat at nobu!  \nwith plans to spend labor day in vegas, i was thrilled with how easy it was to secure an 8pm reservation on the saturday of a long weekend.  economy or vegas?  \n\nboyfriend is a nobu-phile (who isn't, once they've been?) and so insisted that we order the <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> and the kobe on hot rocks, but then gave our server latitude to bring us a few other raw dishes.  every single thing i put in my mouth was outstanding.\nas noted by the legions of yelpers, the <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> blows you away--big, bright, fresh flavors that highlight, not mask, the fish.  \nnext out was snapper with breadcrumbs.  similar to the yellowtail in that it featured fresh fish adorned simply with bold, savory flavors, but with a totally different flavor profile.\nthe third, and final, cold dish was that day's special: toro served with arugula, a truffle oil-infused dressing and topped with fresh truffle shavings.  i was a bit nervous about this dish, having seen it on the menu, because i love truffles in theory but often find them cloyingly rich and heavy, with a sort of artificial after taste.  this dish induced giggles, it was so good (see mastro's review for further discussion).  it also induced an epiphany: i dislike truffle oil for the exact reasons enumerated above but i love fresh truffles.  they have all of the best parts of truffle oil (that intense earthy umami flavor) but without any of the fake, sickeningly denseness.  i know, i know: total white people problem.  \n\nfinally, it was on to the kobe beef on hot rocks.  fun, interactive and tasty as hell.  lots of sauces and spices to choose from, but our favorite was just sea salt and the japanese seven spice.  our waiter (excellent service, incidentally) brought us a 6 oz portion which we finished but couldn't have eaten any more of.  at $27/oz, that's a pricey little entree but definitely a splurge-worthy item if you're looking/able to splurge.\n\nwe rounded things out with cocktails in lieu of wine and i definitely appreciated the relative speed with which the meal moved as we had a comedy show to get to that evening.  i left feeling sated, not stuffed, and already thinking about when i could back to nobu for more.", 
            "so i'm a big sushi fan and this was by far the best i've ever eaten.\n\nthe black cod <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark> is like fish candy, and the yellowfin <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> was probably my favorite dish of the night.\n\ni'd also highly recommend the toro roll if you're into rolls. it was incredible.\n\nthe only dish i didn't care much for was the fried rock shrimp but the overall meal was still out of this world.", 
            "oh nobu, you are definitely deserving of a 4 star review, but alas our server (name withheld) decided that serving us wasn't in his best interests.\n\nnow before i utilize yelp to complain about sub-par service i must document the highlights, because as we know, an amazing kitchen can make up for lacking service.\n\nthe <mark>Black Cod Miso</mark> was a life changer. you owe it to yourself to have this dish.\nalso the <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> was such a wonderful combination of flavors, that honestly, i can't find words to do it justice.\n\nnow as to why nobu earned 3 stars from me instead of 4. our service lacked in every area, inattentive, unwilling to suggest menu items for our group of 5, and at times seemingly spiteful. why did you bring us (2) rock <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark>? it's delicious don't get me wrong, but two? \n\nmaybe the malice was because 2 people in our group were very late, and he was missing out on those <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> tips, or because they couldn't include gratuity? i don't know. but when i'm spending $60-70 per person, i expect a little more.",

            "so obviously if you are going here you know what to expect. we had a great experience. our server was one of the ones who went to open dubai, so we were well taken care of. he did warn us because of our reservation time (10:15p) and kitchen closing (11p), that he was unsure how they would send out what we ordered. so we were prepared. of course, if you are spending nobu money my feeling is the chefs serve until you are done. but that is the only reason for the 4th star, well and another completely over priced wine list. \n\ni have been to nobu next door in nyc, so this was a different experience.\n\nonto the food; we jumped all over the menu but stayed away from the sashimi because that seemed over priced f<mark>Premium Sushi or Sashimi</mark>. we ended up with a few hand rolls that were great because the nori was crispy (which seems tough for other places to pull off). \n\nfrom there we also had the <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark>, as always. then we had the <mark><mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark></mark>, and a couple <mark>Lobster <mark>Tuna <mark>King Crab <mark>Vegetable <mark>Salmon Nobu Style Taco</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark> as well. both good and the <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> great.\n\nmake sure you get the black cod <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark> in lettuce. awesome! just eat it straight away because it comes warm.\n\nif you haven't been, go!", 
            "bottom line: best japanese in a town of lots of good japanese.\n\nwhen our new baby turned 2 months old, my husband and i decided it was time for a real, baby-free date. seeing as how i had not eaten sushi for the preceding 9 months, it had been on my mind for a long time. and when i want some serious sushi, there's only one place to go - nobu!\n\nin all actuality, you shouldn't really order off the sushi menu at nobu - it's good and all, but it's about twice as much as comparable sushi at, say, osaka. what you really want is the <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark>, the black cod <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark>, and whatever else your perfectly-attentive-but-not-really-there waiter recommends. \n\nnot sure what else i can <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> hasn't been said already, but if you're willing to spend the money, nobu is awesome. \n\nside note: if you are there early, and have a small party, you can probably find seats in the lounge or at the sushi bar (still full menu). otherwise, make reservations! just because the restaurant isn't all that full when you arrive, doesn't mean that it is not booked.",

            "i was skeptical, but nobu delivered. i just finished dinner with a friend of mine and i had to write a review before i forgot the details. let's just get to the chase.\n\nmy friend and i walked in and i asked our server what the best three dishes were. he then recommend these three. i felt like a stuck up food critic requesting the chef hit me with his best shot. but i often do this for restaurants that i've never been to. after dinner, i find myself recommending the same. here's the pro and cons:\n\n1) toro carpaccio- okay, $70 for six pieces of fish can be a little on the steep side, but hey, i had to know what it was about. now i know and here's the scoop. the toro is incredibly delicious. it is amazingly tender, quite possibly the most tender toro i've ever had. the fish alone is a star, but the flavor profile that the chefs prepare is pretty impressive too. capers, truffle shavings, truffle oil <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> dressing over greens really hit the mark. i will say that there was a little too much soy sauce for my taste (that's right, i'm chinese and i'm saying it). i would request they served the sauce on the side, but fear they will substitute excess soy sauce with hate.\n\n2)<mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark>- this was almost my favorite dish of the night had it not been for the sheer flavor of the toro. the yellowtail is served as one would expect from an expensive sushi restaurant: fresh, flavorful, tender and seasoned according. the jalapeno slice was perfect- excellent spice without burning my mouth. i would actually recommend this as a first dish. \n\n3) <mark>Black Cod Miso</mark>- i thought this was a little overrated by the other reviews. cooked to near perfection, the cod was warm inside but seared and slightly crispy outside. the miso glaze wasn't much to look at. for me, it resembled gravy. i've seen others' pictures and theirs looks much nicer. nevertheless, the dish was great. i actually prefer black cod cooked slightly medium, but cooked to the core with awesome texture. sweet miso sauce finished off the dish and made it very enjoyable. \n\n4)<mark>Sea Urchin</mark> sashimi or sushi!!! just order it. \n\nmy friend and i were pretty hungry and ordered other dishes but i must say that they didn't exactly knock me off my feet. overall, many of the other dishes were very good, but just not amazing. here's the list:\n\n-<mark>Salmon Skin</mark> hand roll- thin slices of <mark>Salmon Skin</mark> with gobo, rice and seasoning. nice to have a place serve quality over quantity when it comes to the <mark>Salmon Skin</mark>.\n\n-baracuda <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark>- $40 for six slices of barracuda. very interesting texture as i haven't had barracuda before. the lemon/citrus sauce was a bit too much. again, i see this as how the chef intends the dish to be enjoyed, so i simply eat and keep my comments to myself. \n\nlive scallop- again, great cut of <mark>Scallop</mark>, but nothing special to write home about. it was nice that it was served with muscle in ponzu sauce. \n\n<mark>White Fish <mark>Scallop <mark>Salmon <mark>Oyster <mark>Beef <mark>Yuba Sashimi New Style</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark> oyster- four pieces of kumamoto oysters served ready to enjoy. so you have to eat it the way they prepare the seasoning.\n\ncrispy rice w/ <mark>Nobu Crispy Rice with Big Eye Tuna</mark>- for lack of a better term, it's japanese tatter tots. square rice cubes deep fried served with essentially tuna poke. well prepared, tasty, but nothing special. \n\nall in all, it was a great experience. my general assessment is that nobu serves dishes with strong flavor profiles. not exactly my cup of tea. maybe i'm a fond believer that less is more and that the fish should speak for itself. however, i can appreciate the fact that a chef's dish is his own art. so i eat with an open mind and share my interpretation. hope this helps.", 
            "this place came highly recommended to us by a waiter at another restaurant (thanks for the complete disappointment eduardo!).  these are the dishes i tried:\n\n- <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> - was spectacular!  the flavors of this dish were very fresh and enjoyable\n\n- <mark>White Fish <mark>Scallop <mark>Salmon <mark>Oyster <mark>Beef <mark>Yuba Sashimi New Style</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark> sashimi salmon - was basically thin slices of poached salmon drowning in sesame oil\n\n- albacore sushi - thin slice, nothing special...\n\n- salmon sushi- thin slice, nothing special...\n\n- spicy <mark>Big Eye Tuna Roll</mark>- wasn't spicy and the nori wrap was gummy\n\noverpriced and completely not worth it.\n\nand my new pet peeve - do not wipe the table down to prep for the next customer while i am still sitting at the table waiting for my check.  clearing the table is fine, but seriously?  it's completely rude and i think after we dropped $200.00 and only took up about 45 minutes of their time, they could have waited- especially since there were plenty of empty tables around us.  will never go back.", 
            "nobu should <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> letters to the end of its name: e-n-o.  \n\nthe food here tastes better than mcdonald's but worse than chipotle, but i would rate mcdonald's higher due to it being a better value.  we had the tasting menu <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> sushi.  the <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark>, along with every other cold dish, followed the same formula: raw fish + cilantro hidden underneath a pile of salt. the black cod <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark> and the beef tenderloin tasted like bad halloween candy.  everything was either drenched in salt or drenched in sugar, or both.  the sushi was not inedible, it was on par with the kind of sushi you can get from any two-dollar-sign sushi restaurant.  it's pretty hard to mess up sushi to the extent that they messed up their other dishes, since chefs have less artistic license when it comes to sushi.  then again, it's hard to mess up <mark><mark>Lobster <mark>Miso Soup</mark></mark></mark> and theirs was the worst i've ever had (way too salty).  service was good.  \n\nour bill, including tip, came out to nearly $600 for three people.  so if you want to trick your non-asian friends into believing that their palates lack the sophistication to appreciate expensive asian cuisine, nobu is the place to go.  or sometimes when you're feeling masochistic, you just want to get punched in the face.  that's when you go to nobu.  \n\nthere are many reasons to go to nobu, but edible food is not among them.  if you want good food, there are some great french options in the area, such as le cirque.",

            "it is hard to find good quality fish in las vegas being that we live in a desert and our nearest lake is radioactive. but nobu manages to find some high quality and good tasting fish. so far this is the only japanese restaurant in a casino that i have actually liked.  \n\nthe bluefin toro tartar was really fatty which i love and it was sitting in a wasabi sauce that was amazing. with the caviar on top it is one of the single best bites of food i have had. \n\nif you go i would stick to the specialty items on the menu and not order the sushi. you can get near equal quality sushi for less money at other places and it will fill you up faster so you wont get to enjoy their menu as much. also, the black cod <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark> was sooooooo good. the fish melted in my mouth and didnt fall apart when i put a fork to it. \n\nthe saki selection is small but the ones we tried were great.\n\nthe lack of 5 stars is due to the fact that we ordered <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> was soaked <mark>Bone in Ribeye 24oz Nobu Sauce</mark> and there was no resemblance of fish in the dish. everything else we had we loved though.",

            "we planned to have dinner with our friends who live in vegas on one night of our two night stay there recently. after scouring the restaurant recommendations from my friend, we decided on nobu. sometimes i have to be in the mood for sushi, i don't always crave it like other people i know, so i was worrying about committing to a reservation. i was also worried about having to pay a million dollars (slight exageration; i don't even have a million dollars, and if i did, i would only spend half on wine) for any good wine. (true story, i made the mistake of ordering a glass of wine at the bar in the casino at the flamingo (don't ask) one night and it had me wishing for manischewitz.)\n\nok - back to the matter at hand: nobu has now made me crave sashimi, sushi and all japanese food all the time. not only did the server rattle off, in detail, and totally and completely from her memory, just about every item listed on the menu, but the food was amazing. i die. we had a smattering of everything from each \"category\" and honestly, went a bit overboard, but it was a meal well worth going over board on. \n\nwe dined on:\n\n-edamame\n-<mark><mark>Lobster <mark>Miso Soup</mark></mark></mark>\n-tempura fried rock shrimp <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> type of delicious citrusy, creamy sauce\n-<mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> (out of this world)\n-red <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark> (also, amazing)\n-salmon <mark>White Fish <mark>Scallop <mark>Salmon <mark>Oyster <mark>Beef <mark>Yuba Sashimi New Style</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark> sashimi, which was lightly seared and served with green onion, absolutely delicious\n-<mark>Soft Shell Crab</mark> roll\n-spicy <mark>Big Eye Tuna Roll</mark> (cause, come on, you gotta round out the meal)\n\nthe dessert was good but unremarkable. i'm more about the main event.\n\ncap that <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> amazing gin cocktail that i now forget the name of and two glasses of hellaciously expensive, but delicious, sauvignon blanc, and this is one of the top meals i have had in my little life thus far... \n\nin short, take your gambling winnings to nobu and order everything the server suggests.", 
            "just got back from another great vegas weekend. though i have been to nobu here many times, i have never given them a review. long overdue. the good news is that with the opening of the \"new\" place at ceasars, the hard rock location is very easy to get a table now (hope they stay here ;) )\nthe service is always top notch. the food still retains a very high quality. my favs did not dissapoint, the spicy rock <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark>, the <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> and the <mark>Black Cod Miso</mark> cod were perfection. can't wait for my next vegas trip!", 
            "this may be my favorite restaurant in the world. the flavors you discover sitting at your table here are amazing and the staff is amazingly kind and attentive. i've eaten her twice now and will be back many more times. the <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> is a taste delight.", 
            "this is the only restaurant that i would recommend at the hard rock hotel. i was working at the hrh for five days and ended up eating at almost every establishment there. nobu is the only one that i would optionally go to again.\n\nthis is the best sushi i've had. everything was flavorful and top quality. i can't remember all the dishes i had, but below are the ones i can remember (score out of 5):\n\n-bug <mark>Nobu Crispy Rice with Big Eye Tuna</mark> lotus chips 4\n-<mark>Shishito Peppers</mark> 2 (i got a really spicy one!)\n-<mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> 4\n-rock <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark> with creamy spicy sauce 4 (butter ponzu sauce 3)\n-rice cubes <mark>Nobu Crispy Rice with Big Eye Tuna</mark> spread 3\n-sushi roll with 4 types of fish 5\n-<mark>Black Cod Miso</mark> 10 you must get this, it is sooooo good!\n-horchata flan 3\n\ni would go just for the <mark>Black Cod Miso</mark>!\n\nthe food is great, but the service was lacking. when we sat down we were a group of 5 and a 6th person joined us. when the waiter brought the tuna lotus chips out he said there are only 5 since that's how many you were when you sat down. he easily could have said i'll bring you another, but i had to specifically ask him. for the price, service should be better, maybe because it's still in the hard rock.", 
            "this is a review of the groupon deal dinner.\n\nthe skinny: fusion peruvian japanese dishes left me unimpressed (3) service: excellent service despite the disappointing cuisine (5) value: for the groupon, it is still overpriced for what it is. so you can imagine what i have to say about full price ... not worth it (2.5).\n\nso here's the deal. we spotted the nobu groupon for $95/2 person (regularly $150) prix fixe menu and we thought \"how can we pass this up?\".\n\nwe went and were seated prompty. our server was great at giving us time and space to make some decisions on the menu. we ended up getting in <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> to the prix fixe an order of their <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark> to round out the menu. the specials that they offered didn't really appeal - there was a lot of fruit/candied nuts mixed in with sashimi which sounded overly sweet to me so i passed on those.\n\nstarting <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> simple edamame with maldon sea salt (love those flakes!), it was a nice way to start a meal.\n\ncourse 1) <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark>/cilantro (6 slices): this was a good dish but not exceptional. although i have had different versions of this before, this is one of the better renditions given the quality of the fish and the strategically correct amount of heat. my only thing with this dish was the actual slices of sashimi itself - the slices were a bit thin and ragged along the edges which surprised me given the supposed caliber of this place.\n\ncourse 2) selection of nigri (6 pcs) and a california roll (6 pcs): the nigri was okay - the slices of fish were decent sized. i was despondent when i realized that the sushi rice was a little too overcooked and sticky.\n\ncourse 3) rock <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark>: the first bite was good however as we ate, the spicy aioli began to slowly permeate the batter leading to a soggier batter. i think it aioli would have been better served as a dipping sauce rather than dressed on the tempura to retain textural integrity. flavorwise, this was a nice dish and we loved the mixture of chive and togarashi.\n\ncourse 4) miso glazed black cod: candied black cod more like it! overly sweet, the piece of fish was smothered in the sugary sauce which became more unappetizing the more we worked to finish this. i have made this at home using his recipe with 1/2 the sugar and it is much better.\n\ncourse 5) <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark> (<mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> to the groupon): the tempura was okay nothing special. the batter was slightly spongier than what i like. i think it would have been better if the shredded daikon/ginger was provided to us so we could <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> much/little we wanted.\n\ncourse 6) normally this would be <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark> except it was my birthday so i got a molten cake with a tiramisu and green tea <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark>. all of them were very good however there was nothing that really wow'ed me to think that it was exceptional.\n\nperhaps 10 years ago, the level of this fusion cuisine would be considered cutting edge. however time has made his dishes appear quite dated. the signature dishes of rock <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark>/yellowtail jalape\\u00f1o sashimi/miso glazed black cod are easily found elsewhere - one might argue that this location's rendition is rather lackluster considering the price. given the many issues with the dishes mentioned above, i cannot recommend this place given the groupon price let alone full price. although our server was truly exceptional, that doesn't make up for the food. 2.5 rounded up to 3 starred review.", 
            "went in with high expectations, but was deeply disappointed.\n\nlet me preface this review by saying that we went in with a groupon.  yes, nobu is offering a groupon haha!  for $100 you get their most popular dishes for two, including the hamachi <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark>, rock shrimp, miso black cod, plus dessert.  \n\nok, i get that we're groupon customers, i underst<mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> we get treated like second class citizens, so my expectations were adjusted, but they managed to not even meet my groupon expectations.  first of all the portions were way too small.  there were only five thin slices of hamachi to share between two people.  the rock shrimp came out in a nice size bowl, while that's good enough for one person, this is meant for two!  there was also one piece of black cod too to share between two people.  i would say if you do this deal you guys better be very comfortable eating out of the same plate or bowl haha.  \n\ni also must say i'm not generally a big fan of fusion cuisine.  nobu did not change my mind.  these are their most popular dishes, but they feel dated and uninspiring.  perhaps because they've been around for a while and many other places now carry the same things?  the rock shrimp was slathered in this orange color mayo sauce, which reminded me of the walnut shrimp dish so often served in chinese restaurants these days.  the cod had a very sweet miso sauce that kind of ruined the natural flavor of the fish itself.  \n\nnot good value and not a place i would go into looking for high quality and inventive food.", 
            "we were in vegas staying at the hard rock and craving sushi. where else would we have gone to eat? we ordered two signature dishes (yellowtail and cod).. we started with the <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> and cilantro. the jalapenos are an interesting departure from the wasabi we are so familiar with.  i only like a little bit of heat, but i actually wanted more than the thin slices offered.  we each had an order of sunomono (cucumber salad), which were quite large.we ordered the black cod as a hot dish. i would come back in order this again and again and again. we ordered the chef's choice for sushi for two... which was your usual assortment. the tamago was sweet and had the restaurant name seared into the top.  \n\nthe food was very good, the ambience was nice, my asahi was on tap, but you have to leave the restaurant and cross the casino to use the restroom, and the prices were quite high.\n\nyes. i will go again.", 
            "nobu must be my favorite restaurant in vegas.  could it be my favorite anywhere?\n\ni brought a co-worker with me who loves japanese food.  after dinner, he said to me, \"where i grew up, we were taught not to make a religion out of food.  but, after this dinner, i may become a true believer.\"  \n\ndon't think of nobu as a typical japanese restaurant -- even though you can order sushi and sashimi.  think of it as a clever japanese inspired restaurant that takes familiar flavors and brings them to the next level.\n\nfor example, the yellowtail came as very thin, delicate slices <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> and cilantro, instead of wasabi.  the black cod <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark> is sublime.  when i asked for a second order, the waitress suggested the cod with pate in lettuce cups.  that was sublime.", 
            "ohhh....i'm impressed. this is a busy place, so it's better to make a reservation. \nthe design is very stellar. the ceiling has an interesting design and the lights are unusual. it's a little dim, so it makes a mood. it's so pleasant to have dinner in this ambiance. the service was good as well. the servers are very knowledgeable of the menu. they explain every detail on the menu to make sure you know what you order. \nthe food is beautifully designed. i think here you can have one of the best sushi in vegas. i ordered <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark>. it was delicious. next time i'll sit at the bar. it's interesting to see how your food is being prepared. though it's pricey, but if you try this place once you will come back for sure..\nand with all my impressions i have to take on star away for price.", 
            "i had wanted to try nobu for some time, having heard many good things about it. when i saw the $99 groupon plus the 20% off groupon was offering plus my wife's b'day to celebrate there, i knew the stars were aligned.  could it live up to reputation?\nthe food: the groupon is for a 5 course tasting menu. the meal starts with a pass out of edamame with maldon salt. a very generous portion and an excellent way to start a meal. the first course was yellowtail tuna <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> and cilantro. the tuna was sliced super thin and was in a citrus sauce. it was very tasty and different than yellowtail that i have eaten at my local sushi restaurant. things got even better after that. the next dish was rock <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark> with a creamy spicy sauce. wow, was that good! not like any tempura i have eaten before. very lightly breaded, cooked so the shrimp were soft but not mushy. and the spicy sauce was easily handled even by my gringo palate. a great dish. and a huge portion. by its size, the dish would have been enough for dinner if it was the only thing served. this was followed by the alaskan black cod <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark>. another outstanding dish. the fourth course was the sushi; tuna, fluke and salmon with a california roll. this was the weakest part of the menu - only very good. last course, dessert. i photographed the plate. a beautiful presentation with very tasty treats (and a hand written birthday greeting in chocolate). the food rates 5 stars plus.\nthe service: as soon as we were seated, our server, albert, came by to greet us, explain the tasting menu, and take our drink orders. throughout the meal, he, the busboy, and the food runner were very attentive without being overbearing. they made us feel very welcome. our water glasses were never allowed to go below half full. the table was cleared promptly. the food came out of the kitchen plated beautifully. the service was 5 stars plus.\nthe ambiance: the restaurant is nicely decorated with lots of bamboo. however, the tables for 2 were placed one on top of the other. we were there on a monday night, so the tables were never more than 1/3 full.  but our table was about 6 inches from the next table, which was 6 inches from the next in a line up of 4 tables. if the restaurant were crowded and there were people at the next table, we would have been eating with strangers. not my idea of a celebration/romantic meal. at best, 3 stars for ambiance.\nvalue: $80 for dinner of this quality is the deal of the decade. i would do it again in a heartbeat. but i would never go on a weekend night when the table next to me might be occupied (or i would go with a party of 6 or more - the bigger tables were nicely spaced out).", 
            "this place has gone way down hill and for the price, it is pretty scandalous.  went here last saturday night.  the restaurant wasn't even half full so apparently everyone else already got the memo not to come here anymore.  sidenote:  i'd been here before as well as to two other nobu locations, which is also part of the huge disappointment.\n\nthe sushi portions were tiny.  the rock shrimp was delicious, especially when eaten with the greens (although the server should have told the table to do this since it wasn't obvious to my group so i had to inform them).  the <mark>Spicy Tuna (Big Eye)</mark> on crispy rice was a terrible presentation.  the <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> sashimi was beautiful but boring.  same for the tiny sushi portions we received.  miso cod was still excellent.  but the price considering the portions is just offensive.  all in all, not a great experience and i expect so much more from nobu.  perhaps there's a reason we couldn't get into the caesars location that night.  bottom line:  don't come to this nobu.", 
            "i came back four years later and this place is still so good! so good that i went twice in one week which is very unusual for me especially with all the great places vegas has to offer. the items that stuck out for me were the <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> (simple but omg all the flavors work so well together...and that sauce that it comes with is delicious), <mark>Salmon / Salmon Belly</mark>,  <mark>Black Cod Miso</mark>, <mark>Nobu Crispy Rice with Big Eye Tuna</mark>, <mark><mark>Lobster <mark>Miso Soup</mark></mark></mark>, and the kronuts! and the service was absolutely impeccable!", 
            "i have always wanted to try nobu and finally went! and it was worth the wait let me tell you! we went for my bday and did not have a reservation. we got there pretty early around 5ish so they were able to sit us without a res. our waiter jeffrey was on point. best service. he recommended we start with the <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark>. it was melt in my mouth amazing. i could live off the dish for the rest of my life. lol. it was yellowtail with the right amount of sweetness and spice. we also got the cucumber salad which was pretty good. a lot of the vinegar did go to the bottom of the bowl which made it hard to coat your salad but it was still good. we also had a sear salmon sashimi which i do not remember the name that was excellent. we got spicy edamame, <mark>Beef Kushiyaki</mark>, the black cod <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark> and the wagyu beef gyoza. the cod was really good and highly recommended. the wagyu beef was great with two dipping sauces. we literally could have kept ordering food. we had a couple of nice cocktails as well. \n\nafter dinner they brought us out a plate with happy birthday with a choc cake and green <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark>. we also ordered the whiskey moose. both <mark>Dessert</mark> were to die for and i was in heaven. \n\nwhat a fun place to go. you have people dressed to the max, casual people, people from all over the world that come and eat here. come chow down some amazing eats, listen to some funky music and watch the beautiful people. yes please!"

            "the visit was on a labor day sunday around 6pm.  the last visit to this particular nobu was back in 2003 when i didn't know the difference between a piece of foie and a rubber sole.  i recall having the chef special back then as well, but the omakase this time was definitely more enjoyable.  this was probably due to the fact that i wasn't three sheets to the wind this time.  being married does these things.\n\nthere were those that chose the bronze omakase ($100) and those that went for the silver ($150) like yours truly, and boy was there ever a difference.  there were major discrepancies between the cuts and also the types of meats served.  the sashimi and the speciality dishes also had noticeable differences.  it's not to say that the 100 dollar omakase wasn't good, but it wasn't great...at least from my vantage point.\n\nthere's about a zillion details i will be leaving out, such as the dried flakes of hoo-haa sprinkled with a drizzle of the thinger thang.  so use your imagination..\n\ncourse 1 - a bonito sashimi.\ncourse 2 - amaebi splashed with hot oil, chawan mushi with truffle and crab eggs at the bottom, kampachi sashimi with dried miso flakes.\ncourse 3 - toro sashimi <mark>King Crab with Amazu Ponzu</mark> ginger sauce <mark>Yellowtail and Jalapeno</mark> sauce topped with a bunch of edible flowers which made it all purdy and crap.\ncourse 4 - seared <mark>Scallop</mark> on a bed of sea beans.\ncourse 5 - kobe beef (served medium) with pan fried <mark>Teppan Style Foie Gras</mark>.\ncourse 6 - sushi set (nigiri) <mark>Inaniwa Pasta with Lobster</mark> broth and <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark>.  the set consisted of - toro, abalone, spanish mackerel, eel, tai (<mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark>) and tamago.\ncourse 7 - an array of sweets including <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark>, chocolate looking souffle thing, fresh fruits and other sugary confections we couldn't stay for because we were already late for the friggin cirque du pouffay show.\n\n..\n\nall in all, a great meal.  i enjoyed the silver omakase at matsuhisa better, the wife liked this dinner much better.  definitely a strong 4 star, but nowhere near a five.  the highlight of the meal for me was the foie served over the kobe.  the dish was so luxurious i really was at a loss for words as i was enjoying every delectable bite.  the slice of black truffle in the chawan mushi gives you a big mule kick in the face which was in short, heavenly.  \n\ni was surprised to find that i liked the non sushi dishes better than the raw, but is it such a huge surprise?  we live in cities like la, sf, ny, etc. where quality ingredients are so readily available.  i've had sashimi as good if not better in other restaurants.  most don't serve it with the detail and ingenuity like mr. nobu matsuhisa, but it takes way too much money to surprise this sushi cowboy.\n\ni truly don't mean to sound snobbish, but there's only so many ways to serve up a nice slab of toro.  i'm more impressed these days by the way chefs serve up foie.  and i am totally infatuated with bone marrow.\n\n..\n\ni've said too much.  \n\ni am off to eat.\n\nedit:\n\ni don't know if it was because we were in vegas, but i felt like everything was a bit contrived.\n\n*shrugs*", 
            "bluf...the dining highlight of my trip to vegas with my girlfriend was our dinner at nobu.  this was my third trip to nobu, each time having had the chef's omakase tasting menu.  nobu's tasting menu is a thoughtfully composed meal served kaiseki-style (sort of a themed meal) that seeks to tie together individual dishes by attributes like taste, texture, and temperature to enhance the overall experience of the meal.  since there isn't a set menu, you select the price point you're willing to pay and the chef and the kitchen staff prepares an appropriate amount of courses using whatever exotic ingredients they deem fit.  we both received 9 courses with sake pairing. \n\nfirst course:  we started with a kumamoto oyster wrapped in <mark>Smoked Salmon</mark> topped with a osetra caviar, served on an endive leaf in an asparagus \"boat\" with accompanied by sweet <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> miso sauces.  a masterful start!  the 5 basic tastes were tastefully and elegantly captured together in a single dish! \n\nsecond course:  shima-aji sashimi served in a tosazu (vinegared sardines) gel\\u00e9e with micro celery and \"sea grapes\" kelp...garnished with pickled turnip.  a great all-around dish, but the pickle turnip was the ingredient that put it over the top!\n\nthird course:  bluefin tuna sashimi topped <mark>Squid 'Pasta' with Light Garlic</mark> pur\\u00e9e and sliced serrano chilies with jalape\\u00f1o emulsion over brown rice salsa.  i love sashimi, but the garlicky goodness and spiciness from the chilies was amazing.  the brown rice salsa was damn tasty in its own right!\n\nfourth course:  <mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> and seared sweet shrimp <mark><mark>Nobu's Moriawase Sashimi Salad</mark></mark> served with m\\u00e2che, peppercorn, <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Whole <mark>1/2 Maine Lobster</mark></mark> <mark>Roasted Poussin with Spicy Lemon</mark></mark> dressing.   another success!  the peppercorns gave it the spicy notes that greatly accented the raw fish.\n\nintermezzo:  a <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark>...a simple yet refreshing palate cleanser that marked the transition from cold dishes to hot.\n\nfifth course:  pan-seared seabass, seasonal mushrooms, and wild ramps served in a <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> sauce.  as much as i loved the seabass, the earthy mushrooms and ramps nearly stole the show in this dish!\n\nsixth course:  grilled wagyu beef with seared <mark>Teppan Style Foie Gras</mark> served over yellow sweet corn and snap peas <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark>-mirin reduction.  the oh-so-tender australian-raised wagyu beef paired nicely with the perfectly seared <mark>Teppan Style Foie Gras</mark>.  \n\nseventh course:  dashi <mark>Inaniwa Pasta with Lobster</mark> and enoki mushroom with japanese greens.  so simple, yet such an incredibly satisfying dish!  they didn't skimp on the lobster, either.  in many ways, this was my favorite dish of the night.\n\neighth course:  a selection of sushi...otoro (fatty tuna), tasmanian sea trout, <mark>Sea Eel</mark>, a fish i can't recall, mirugai (geoduck), and tamago (egg omelet).  i love sushi.  i loved all of these nigiri!\n\nninth course:  shiso (?) panna cotta with strawberry \"caviar\", an understated but very satisfying closer to our meal.  the \"caviar\" was made to resemble ikura or salmon roe and was a very nice, creative touch.\n\nas for our sake, chris (i think that was his name), our lead server, informed us that nobu imports its sake from japan and that it's made especially for nobu.  i'm not an expert, at all, on the finer aspects of sake.  suffice it to say, our pairings were very nice, with subtle, yet interesting differences between each glass and went well with each dish.  chris did a great job all-around job taking care of us.  we had a very leisurely meal, never feeling rushed, but we never had to wait for our next course or glass of sake.  the timing was impeccable!\n\ni'm really not the type of person to toss out superlatives casually, but our meal was arguably one of the best meals i've ever had...at least since i've started yelping!  each dish was memorable and no single dish clearly stood out as the best since they were all outstanding!  it takes a lot of hair-splitting to even pick a dish that was less satisfying that the rest but if i had to pick one, it was the wagyu and <mark>Teppan Style Foie Gras</mark> course...and that was only due to the impression that the accompaniments on other dishes were more exciting than the sweet corn and snap peas.  if you're in vegas for one night and can only eat at one place while you're there, go to nobu and have the omakase tasting menu!  you won't regret it!"

            "if japanese food is your thing the nobu experience is impeccable. at first bite the mixtures and textures of peruvian sauces compliment the fish incredibly well. i adored the <mark>Uni or Oyster Shooter</mark> (the perfect starter) and the sashimi the most. tried toro, salmon, and yellowtail with jalape\\u00f1o- all tasted so fresh and exotic with the ponzu and spicy flavors. white fish with chili paste was a close second to the sashimi platter, wagyu beef incredibly tender. \nalso, did i mention the drinks were phenomenal? the lychee martini was good and strong, the cucumber martini was refreshing, the mango and passion super sweet and fruity (would suggest for a fruity drinker) and last but not least the favorite drink was the hakka nigori. the hakka nigori was like a mexican mojito but instead with sake- chilled, minty, strong and delicious! the ambiance made me feel like i was in a japanese hole-in-the-wall restaurant. \nthe service was fantastic and our server helped us decide what to order on the menu. i would go back again and completely trust my server with the menu and have them decide for me, they're that good! great service, top 5 favorite restaurants in vegas and i will be back. can't wait to try nobu caesars location!",

            "i've heard various friends praise los angeles's nobu over the years, so after my girlfriend ran the las vegas marathon this weekend, we decided to celebrate <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> first-class sushi.\n\nwe had reservations at 9:00 pm, and we were seated promptly (actually ahead of time, which was nice). my first impression of the restaurant was that it was extremely loud (we were there on a tuesday night), and its location in the hard rock hotel made me groan (it's a bit out of the way, and not necessarily a place i want to poke around).\n\nour waiter, justin, was initially very prompt with our drink orders, but it took 10 minutes (and a reminder) to get glasses of water, and another 10 to get <mark><mark>Lobster <mark>Miso Soup</mark></mark></mark>.\n\nour first course was only half right (we got two dishes, but one was not what we ordered). the servers apologized and took it away. at the rate they were bringing out our food, though, we shuddered to think how long it would take them to bring out the correct dish. for<mark>Tuna (Big Eye)</mark>, it was corrected quickly.\n\nwhen our sushi came out, we noticed another mistake: the <mark>Spicy Miso Chips <mark>Nobu Crispy Rice with Big Eye Tuna</mark> or <mark>Scallop</mark></mark> had been mistakenly replaced with a second order of <mark>Spicy Tuna (Big Eye)</mark>. again, we told them it was wrong and again, they corrected the mistake rather quickly.\n\nservice got to be so bad that after asking a server to hail our waiter (and subsequently having the request ignored), we decided to get the manager over to our table. we were 30 seconds from getting up and leaving (she took another 5 minutes to get to the table) when she came over and heard our story. she seemed as interested in our plight as any manager should and agreed to comp some of our dishes, which was nice.\n\nstill, however, justin's service through the entire night was abysmal (i think we saw him 3 times over an hour and a half), and no amount of manager treatment could save the tip.\n\nregarding the food, it was ok. the <mark><mark>Lobster <mark>Miso Soup</mark></mark></mark> was great. the <mark>Spicy Tuna (Big Eye)</mark> and scallop rolls were anything but (very mild), and the hot/cold mixture of the tuna tempura rolls was a little strange. it was good, but the temperature difference was one of those things that made me wonder, \"is this supposed to be this way and i'm an idiot for thinking this, or is something actually wrong with how it was made?\" judging by the fact that the tuna tempura rolls were one of the dishes they got wrong initially, it could have been that they rushed the order and made it worse. either way, i wasn't really in love with it.\n\nfor the price i [would have] paid, i can't say that the las vegas nobu is really worth it for me again. i've had much better sushi in oakland, for much less.", 
            "i only had the sushi so i can't review the hot dishes, so here it goes. the <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> and yuzu was by far the best and the <mark>Nobu Crispy Rice with Big Eye Tuna</mark> <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark> shrimp were good as well, but not worth twice the price of a decent sushi place. i don't know what exactly i was expecting, but this definitely fell short.\n\nalthough the cucumber lychee martini was delicious. i would come back to try the hot dishes if someone else was picking up the tab, otherwise i think pink taco would probably be just as satisfying.\n\noh and i really wasn't that impressed with the decor, why is bamboo so luxe?", 
            "after being seated, our table was presented a single drink menu, and left alone for fifteen minutes. our waiter seemed a little miffed when he asked what we were going to start with to drink and i told him that we'd like to see food menus. i found it presumptuous and manipulative to leave us with a drink menu and that much free time. we are in vegas, i know, but when you're willing to pay for a nice meal, i expect a little more tact on behalf of the servers.\n\nour waiter was also very quick to tell us how he thought we should move through the menu, all the while, mispronouncing common japanese dishes.\n\nwe tried a number of different dishes and rolls from the blue fin toro to <mark>Spicy Miso Chips <mark>Nobu Crispy Rice with Big Eye Tuna</mark> or <mark>Scallop</mark></mark>, <mark>Fresh Water Eel</mark>, albacore, and <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark>. everything was... good. not impressive, certainly not memorable... just good.\n\nthe interior of this location was bland. one of my co-workers mentioned that the decoration on the walls looked like large ironing boards, which was a fair assessment. the main dining area was too bright for a comfortable dinner, and had us sitting around the kind of small, wood topped table you might find yourself at while having lunch at your favorite sandwich shop.\n\nthe banana cake <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> cream <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark> was a high note, although the spoonful <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark> that they tried to pass off as a scoop made me feel like i was caught in a scene from american psycho. \n\nfor all the noise i heard about nobu being something special, i left feeling uninspired, and with a reminder to myself why finding those one of a kind, family run japanese restaurants is such a treat.", 
            "skip nobu if you've been to any other location. the atmosphere was very la and kind of snobby. it's a place to see and be seen and sadly this is applicable to the food as well. the menu was confusing and it almost felt like this was done on purpose in order to force the diner to chose the chef's tasting menu. we decided against it (at $100+ per person, we felt we could do better). we chose the <mark><mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark></mark>, <mark>Nobu Crispy Rice with Big Eye Tuna</mark> tempura roll and the <mark>Lobster <mark>Tuna <mark>King Crab <mark>Vegetable <mark>Salmon Nobu Style Taco</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark> to start. the tacos were insanely delicious and everything hit the mark quite well. these composed the \"cold\" dishes that nobu offers and then we moved on to the hot dishes which included kobe beef tataki style, black cod <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark> as well as some sashimi. the kobe beef was incredible and literally melted in our moths and it's no wonder the cod is a famous dish - it was delicious. looking at the menu now i'm uncertain as to why we felt the way we did, but i remember being less than enthused about dropping a few hundred dollars and not feeling like i got real value from our money. the atmosphere was cold and had it been a little friendlier perhaps we would have felt differently. the food felt like a celebrity chef was overseeing it, but you could tell this restaurant was a chain given how gimmicky everything was. sad because there's such a brand behind this name and they're just not living up to it.", 
            "!-!-!a-m-a-z-i-n-g-!-!-!\nok, so first off, i have never been a seafood fan, never mind sushi so this was my second time and it was amazing!!  everything you've heard about nobu is true!  i read the reviews and was down to try it when bf suggested it on our recent vegas trip.\nso we get there and are seated immediately, kudos.  i ordered the champagne 59 or some concoction and bf orders the mango martini-both are very yummay!!  but i think the mango was the better of the two!  \nso, me being a newbie on the sushi scene i was a bit intimidated by the menu and just jumped in and ordered the tuna tempura roll off the cold menu to start off with, really wasn't sure but it proved to be good!!! omg, even bf, who isn't really down <mark>Nobu Crispy Rice with Big Eye Tuna</mark>, was floored.  the tuna had scallions in the middle i believe....whatever it was delish!  and the sauce it had was soooo good, i don't even know what it was, i should've asked.  ok, shit was so good after we ordered the next 2 rolls, we ordered another order of the tuna tempura, and the tempura was so slight, it great crunch to the tiniest degree.\nnext, we ordered the <mark>Soft Shell Crab</mark> roll was again a mystery.  was a very welcome bite to my mouth, i don't know what else was in it but had a crunch also.  the crab was very good, not a hint of the seafoody about it! \nalso on our table was the <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark> roll, i know tempura is a no-no to the sushi elite, but training wheels here kids!  never mind that, this roll was a fave!  i also ordered another plate of this little roll because i loved it so much!  again, tiny bit of the tempura crunch=goodness!  the amazingness of this is too good to put into words......i again don't even know what was in it besides the skrimps but i honestly feel like going there again, like now.  \nso for dessert i ordered this thing described as apple brioche with caramel sauce that comes with a gelato.  it came out and looked like little donut holes!  was so good!  they were covered in sugar and inside was tiny chopped up apples and on the side in a little spoon was the carmel. little bites of <mark>Sweet Shrimp with Fried Head</mark>!  \nas for service-stellar! she was on it when we needed drinks and more sushi, but she kinda lacked when i asked about rolls.  that's ok, i walked out very happy!", 
            "i absolutely love nobu. i visit vegas 2-3 times per year. every time my husband and i go, we make it a point to dine at nobu. we always get several dishes to share. our favorites are the black cod and the jalapeno sashimi. the sashimi is to die for. i live in the sf bay area where we have a million sushi joints and i have yet to find sashimi as wonderful as nobu's - please if someone knows of a place let me know because i crave yummy sashimi. the spicy miso lotus chips <mark>Nobu Crispy Rice with Big Eye Tuna</mark> is delish too! actually, we have been happy with everything we have tried. \n\nnobu is definitely on the pricey side but so worth every penny. we are always sure to take our time with our meal and savor every bite! our bill is usually anywhere from $80 (no alcohol) to $120 (with alcohol). the other great thing is that all the wait staff work together so your plates are constantly cleared and your table cleaned. they even fold your napkin for you if you get up from the table. \n\nthe only reason why i give nobu 4 stars instead of 5 is because every so often we will get a waiter who is pompous and thinks his shit doesn't stink, which is really unfor<mark>Tuna (Big Eye)</mark> because most of the wait staff is really great! if i could knock only a half star off for that, i would!",

            "best sushi ever!!! \nwe could not get a table without a reservation but that worked out perfectly because we ended up at the sushi bar. you can order your sushi items right to the chefs, who prepare your sushi right in front of you. it is the perfect spot to sit if you are flying solo or with one other person. \nthe <mark>Nobu Crispy Rice with Big Eye Tuna</mark> was so good that i wanted to go back just for that! actually, i still daydream about it and would go back just for that!",

            "i was skeptical, but nobu delivered. i just finished dinner with a friend of mine and i had to write a review before i forgot the details. let's just get to the chase.\n\nmy friend and i walked in and i asked our server what the best three dishes were. he then recommend these three. i felt like a stuck up food critic requesting the chef hit me with his best shot. but i often do this for restaurants that i've never been to. after dinner, i find myself recommending the same. here's the pro and cons:\n\n1) toro carpaccio- okay, $70 for six pieces of fish can be a little on the steep side, but hey, i had to know what it was about. now i know and here's the scoop. the toro is incredibly delicious. it is amazingly tender, quite possibly the most tender toro i've ever had. the fish alone is a star, but the flavor profile that the chefs prepare is pretty impressive too. capers, truffle shavings, truffle oil <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> dressing over greens really hit the mark. i will say that there was a little too much soy sauce for my taste (that's right, i'm chinese and i'm saying it). i would request they served the sauce on the side, but fear they will substitute excess soy sauce with hate.\n\n2)<mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark>- this was almost my favorite dish of the night had it not been for the sheer flavor of the toro. the yellowtail is served as one would expect from an expensive sushi restaurant: fresh, flavorful, tender and seasoned according. the jalapeno slice was perfect- excellent spice without burning my mouth. i would actually recommend this as a first dish. \n\n3) <mark>Black Cod Miso</mark>- i thought this was a little overrated by the other reviews. cooked to near perfection, the cod was warm inside but seared and slightly crispy outside. the miso glaze wasn't much to look at. for me, it resembled gravy. i've seen others' pictures and theirs looks much nicer. nevertheless, the dish was great. i actually prefer black cod cooked slightly medium, but cooked to the core with awesome texture. sweet miso sauce finished off the dish and made it very enjoyable. \n\n4)<mark>Sea Urchin</mark> sashimi or sushi!!! just order it. \n\nmy friend and i were pretty hungry and ordered other dishes but i must say that they didn't exactly knock me off my feet. overall, many of the other dishes were very good, but just not amazing. here's the list:\n\n-<mark>Salmon Skin</mark> hand roll- thin slices of <mark>Salmon Skin</mark> with gobo, rice and seasoning. nice to have a place serve quality over quantity when it comes to the <mark>Salmon Skin</mark>.\n\n-baracuda <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark>- $40 for six slices of barracuda. very interesting texture as i haven't had barracuda before. the lemon/citrus sauce was a bit too much. again, i see this as how the chef intends the dish to be enjoyed, so i simply eat and keep my comments to myself. \n\nlive scallop- again, great cut of <mark>Scallop</mark>, but nothing special to write home about. it was nice that it was served with muscle in ponzu sauce. \n\n<mark>White Fish <mark>Scallop <mark>Salmon <mark>Oyster <mark>Beef <mark>Yuba Sashimi New Style</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark> oyster- four pieces of kumamoto oysters served ready to enjoy. so you have to eat it the way they prepare the seasoning.\n\ncrispy rice w/ <mark>Nobu Crispy Rice with Big Eye Tuna</mark>- for lack of a better term, it's japanese tatter tots. square rice cubes deep fried served with essentially tuna poke. well prepared, tasty, but nothing special. \n\nall in all, it was a great experience. my general assessment is that nobu serves dishes with strong flavor profiles. not exactly my cup of tea. maybe i'm a fond believer that less is more and that the fish should speak for itself. however, i can appreciate the fact that a chef's dish is his own art. so i eat with an open mind and share my interpretation. hope this helps.", 
            "several different nobu locations worldwide and the us. this nobu is located inside hard rock hotel - the first one in vegas (and the better one). i had one of my birthday celebrations here.\n\nwe got <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark>, <mark>Nobu Crispy Rice with Big Eye Tuna</mark> tataki <mark>King Crab with Amazu Ponzu</mark>, chocolate banana martini, lychee martini, <mark><mark>Nobu's Moriawase Sashimi Salad</mark></mark>, <mark>Shrimp or <mark>Scallop</mark> with Wasabi Pepper or Spicy Garlic</mark> sauce, <mark>Tenderloin of Beef</mark> toban yaki, nobu's <mark>House Special</mark>, <mark>Salmon Skin</mark> handroll, kulfi and my birthday \"<mark>Bento Box</mark>\".\n\nsashimi and <mark><mark>Nobu's Moriawase Sashimi Salad</mark></mark>:\nthe fish here is generously cut.  they're fresh and the sauces they come with accent the fish. 5/5\n\n<mark>Shrimp or <mark>Scallop</mark> with Wasabi Pepper or Spicy Garlic</mark> sauce:\nif you like garlic and a little bit of spiciness - this is the dish for you.  the garlic sauce was amazing. the dish comes <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> mushrooms. 5/5\n\n<mark>Tenderloin of Beef</mark> toban yaki:\ncame in a sizzling plate. a piece of very tender and juicy steak with enoki mushrooms <mark>Tuna (Big Eye) and Asparagus</mark>. simple but delightful dish. 5/5\n\nnobu's <mark>House Special</mark>:\nsalmon, tuna, hamachi, avocado and crab meat  wrapped in nori and daikon, sprinkled with masago. each of the 6 pieces are not-so-bite-sized. 4/5\n\n<mark>Salmon Skin</mark> handroll:\n<mark>Salmon Skin</mark> with just a very thin layer of salmon meat making each piece so crispy and delicious. that's all that matters in a <mark>Salmon Skin</mark> handroll. 5/5\n\nkulfi:\nchocolate pistachio frozen custard, nobu cabernet cherries, candied pistachios, chocolate feulletine.  great textures: crispy and creamy. 5/5\n\n<mark>Bento Box</mark>:\nflourless chocolate cake, white chocolate sauce, shiso syrup and green tea <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark>. i'm not sure why it's called a <mark>Bento Box</mark> since it definitely doesn't come in one. it was free and yummy. 4/5",

            "just absolute perfection!  one of the best meals of my life, i can't pick which dish is my favorite.  the service was beyond fantastic.  i love how they recommend how to eat each item!  some of my highlights were the jalape\\u00f1o hamachi, the <mark>Nobu Crispy Rice with Big Eye Tuna</mark>, the miso glazed cod, and the creamy spicy rock shrimp.  the sushi was so fresh and delicious!  the cocktails and cold sake were divine as well.  not a cheap meal, but you get what you pay for!", 
            "four of us dined at nobu on feb 28th. i was very disappointed in the quality, texture, and flavor of the seafood dishes. also, the waitstaff seemed rushed and it was extremely loud. those two elements combined made it a very chaotic ambiance. we ordered $400 (overpriced) worth of food and drinks. the following are dishes i had sampled.\n\nspicy miso lotus chips <mark>Nobu Crispy Rice with Big Eye Tuna</mark> & scallop - the chips were crispy and not oily. the tuna was ok. the <mark>Scallop</mark> were not. something was off.\n\n<mark>Shishito Peppers</mark> - i loved these peppers. they are full of flavor yet not spicy. i could snack on them all day. \n\n<mark>Mushroom Soup</mark> - this tasted meaty and delicious.\n\ntoro (blue fin) <mark>Toro (Blue Fin) <mark>Yellowtail and Scallion</mark></mark> sushi roll - i did not like this at all. the texture of the fish seemed off to me.\n\n<mark>Sea Urchin</mark> nigiri - the texture and flavor was ok.\n\n<mark>Chicken Kushiyaki</mark> (teriyaki & anticucho) - ok. a bit dry and overcooked. \n\nteriyaki <mark>Tenderloin of Beef</mark> - good.", 
            "i came back four years later and this place is still so good! so good that i went twice in one week which is very unusual for me especially with all the great places vegas has to offer. the items that stuck out for me were the <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> (simple but omg all the flavors work so well together...and that sauce that it comes with is delicious), <mark>Salmon / Salmon Belly</mark>,  <mark>Black Cod Miso</mark>, <mark>Nobu Crispy Rice with Big Eye Tuna</mark>, <mark><mark>Lobster <mark>Miso Soup</mark></mark></mark>, and the kronuts! and the service was absolutely impeccable!"

            "we stopped by nobu two nights ago and had a wonderful dinner.  we arrived and were seated at a booth....the decor of the restaurant was fairly trendy with an asian/bamboo wood theme.\n\nbased on the many yelp reviews we ordered the yellowfish <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark>, black cod w/ miso, <mark>Lobster <mark>Tuna <mark>King Crab <mark>Vegetable <mark>Salmon Nobu Style Taco</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark>, rock shrimp w/ 3 dipping sauces, the house sushi roll and the <mark>Bento Box</mark> desert (warm chocolate w/green tea <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark>).\n\neach item was outstanding.....great unique flavors for each dish.  our favs were the black cod w/miso and the rock shrimp.  super yummy!\n\nnobu rocks with a hit!\n\na cool michelin star restaurant in sin city!",

            "this is a difficult review for me to write - i have regarded nobu matsuhisa as one of the most innovative chefs in japanese cuisine. maybe time is passing by and his '<mark>White Fish <mark>Scallop <mark>Salmon <mark>Oyster <mark>Beef <mark>Yuba Sashimi New Style</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark>' doesn't seem so 'new' anymore? \n\ni've had sushi at the london, dallas, and nyc locations of nobu in the past, as well as the excellent original matsuhisa restaurant in la. my visit to nobu in las vegas did not seem to compare with the others. it was great sushi, to be sure - fresh, quality cuts of fish with well-prepared 'cooked' dishes. the service during my visit was pretty indifferent (we sat at the sushi bar) and the chef we sat in front of only seemed to be going through the paces of preparing food at a restaurant that would be packed with hipsters regardless of the quality or preparation of the food. perhaps the global expansion of nobu has dulled this place - haven't seen a change on a nobu menu in years. sad.\n\nanyway, enough hatin'. i had a great <mark>Creamy Spicy Crab</mark> (excellent dish), lots of sushi - uni, konpachi, unagi, chyu-toro, kani - a portion of nobu's house sake (love the bamboo flasks there), tempura, and the exellent miso-marinated black cod. it was all good. but i'm not sure i'll seek out the lv branch of nobu in the future (it was located in our hotel in vegas). \n\ngiven nobu's prices with its growing 'chain' atmosphere and innovativeness of other places (morimoto, tyson cole's uchi), i can only give nobu-lv 3 stars.", 
            "i walk in this place and say \"please do not hand me a menu\". i know it like the back of my hand.  i have been here several times over many years and cannot get enough of the \"<mark>White Fish <mark>Scallop <mark>Salmon <mark>Oyster <mark>Beef <mark>Yuba Sashimi New Style</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark> sashimi\".  i get the white fish and salmon, delish!  very thin sliced fish served in a warmer than room temperature sesame oil sauce sprinkled with chives. now it's on to the yellow tail w/ jalapeno peppers.  melt in your mouth!  next is the popcorn shrimp, not too breaded, crunchy and that sauce...yum!  <mark>Chilean Seabass</mark> is next up- buttery, tender and the flavor is indescribable.  black cod w/ miso sauce- perhaps my favorite dish. it's done right!  and believe me, i make this at  home, it's hard to find a miso paste that has the right balance so not to over power the fish.  so yeah, this is an expensive place to dine but i am never disappointed.  i am not a big portion person, if you are, you'd hate it or go broke here. i love the quality, care and presentation of every dish here.  wine list is good and cocktails are imaginative.  service is always good here and if you don't take my word about the aforementioned menu options, the wait staff is happy to recommend and explain the dishes in great detail.", 
            "having owned nobu's cookbook for years, i was only too excited to finally visit a restaurant of his.

            "this is the 2nd time i've been to nobu las vegas, the first time was probably 8 years ago and i remember loving the food!  this time, i was underwhelmed and here are the reasons why:\n\n1. <mark>White Fish <mark>Scallop <mark>Salmon <mark>Oyster <mark>Beef <mark>Yuba Sashimi New Style</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark> sashimi isn't really new anymore, it's been around for a dang long time and to be honest, it's kinda played out.  s.b. and i both agreed that the plain sashimi was way better.  one suggestion would be to keep the sauces on the side rather than drowning the delicate fish...\n2. confusing menu - they had filet mignon in about 4 places on the menu, all with cryptic descriptions and different prices - once on the specials, twice on the hot items, and again on the last page.  i asked the waiter what was the difference between them all, and he wasn't able to articulate it.  we settled on the one with uni butter and peruvian potato salad ($50), it was char grilled and tender, but the cabernet sauce was way too sweet.\n3. the format made me think of a deconstructed combo plate, where you pick and choose off of the different menus, but in the end you basically had a combo plate - complete <mark>Chilean Sea Bass with Black Bean, Dry Miso, or Balsalmic Teriyaki</mark> chicken, salad, <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark>!\n\ndon't get me wrong, the food was still very good, but the experience just didn't have the same wow factor.  i guess back in the day, this was kinda revolutionary for a japanese restaurant.  it was high end, high quality, modern ambiance, and modern preparation, but 10 years later, after everyone and their mother has copied this format, it's just common.\n\nback to the drawing board nobu!",

            "i was skeptical, but nobu delivered. i just finished dinner with a friend of mine and i had to write a review before i forgot the details. let's just get to the chase.\n\nmy friend and i walked in and i asked our server what the best three dishes were. he then recommend these three. i felt like a stuck up food critic requesting the chef hit me with his best shot. but i often do this for restaurants that i've never been to. after dinner, i find myself recommending the same. here's the pro and cons:\n\n1) toro carpaccio- okay, $70 for six pieces of fish can be a little on the steep side, but hey, i had to know what it was about. now i know and here's the scoop. the toro is incredibly delicious. it is amazingly tender, quite possibly the most tender toro i've ever had. the fish alone is a star, but the flavor profile that the chefs prepare is pretty impressive too. capers, truffle shavings, truffle oil <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> dressing over greens really hit the mark. i will say that there was a little too much soy sauce for my taste (that's right, i'm chinese and i'm saying it). i would request they served the sauce on the side, but fear they will substitute excess soy sauce with hate.\n\n2)<mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark>- this was almost my favorite dish of the night had it not been for the sheer flavor of the toro. the yellowtail is served as one would expect from an expensive sushi restaurant: fresh, flavorful, tender and seasoned according. the jalapeno slice was perfect- excellent spice without burning my mouth. i would actually recommend this as a first dish. \n\n3) <mark>Black Cod Miso</mark>- i thought this was a little overrated by the other reviews. cooked to near perfection, the cod was warm inside but seared and slightly crispy outside. the miso glaze wasn't much to look at. for me, it resembled gravy. i've seen others' pictures and theirs looks much nicer. nevertheless, the dish was great. i actually prefer black cod cooked slightly medium, but cooked to the core with awesome texture. sweet miso sauce finished off the dish and made it very enjoyable. \n\n4)<mark>Sea Urchin</mark> sashimi or sushi!!! just order it. \n\nmy friend and i were pretty hungry and ordered other dishes but i must say that they didn't exactly knock me off my feet. overall, many of the other dishes were very good, but just not amazing. here's the list:\n\n-<mark>Salmon Skin</mark> hand roll- thin slices of <mark>Salmon Skin</mark> with gobo, rice and seasoning. nice to have a place serve quality over quantity when it comes to the <mark>Salmon Skin</mark>.\n\n-baracuda <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark>- $40 for six slices of barracuda. very interesting texture as i haven't had barracuda before. the lemon/citrus sauce was a bit too much. again, i see this as how the chef intends the dish to be enjoyed, so i simply eat and keep my comments to myself. \n\nlive scallop- again, great cut of <mark>Scallop</mark>, but nothing special to write home about. it was nice that it was served with muscle in ponzu sauce. \n\n<mark>White Fish <mark>Scallop <mark>Salmon <mark>Oyster <mark>Beef <mark>Yuba Sashimi New Style</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark> oyster- four pieces of kumamoto oysters served ready to enjoy. so you have to eat it the way they prepare the seasoning.\n\ncrispy rice w/ <mark>Nobu Crispy Rice with Big Eye Tuna</mark>- for lack of a better term, it's japanese tatter tots. square rice cubes deep fried served with essentially tuna poke. well prepared, tasty, but nothing special. \n\nall in all, it was a great experience. my general assessment is that nobu serves dishes with strong flavor profiles. not exactly my cup of tea. maybe i'm a fond believer that less is more and that the fish should speak for itself. however, i can appreciate the fact that a chef's dish is his own art. so i eat with an open mind and share my interpretation. hope this helps.", 
            "this place came highly recommended to us by a waiter at another restaurant (thanks for the complete disappointment eduardo!).  these are the dishes i tried:\n\n- <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> - was spectacular!  the flavors of this dish were very fresh and enjoyable\n\n- <mark>White Fish <mark>Scallop <mark>Salmon <mark>Oyster <mark>Beef <mark>Yuba Sashimi New Style</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark> sashimi salmon - was basically thin slices of poached salmon drowning in sesame oil\n\n- albacore sushi - thin slice, nothing special...\n\n- salmon sushi- thin slice, nothing special...\n\n- spicy <mark>Big Eye Tuna Roll</mark>- wasn't spicy and the nori wrap was gummy\n\noverpriced and completely not worth it.\n\nand my new pet peeve - do not wipe the table down to prep for the next customer while i am still sitting at the table waiting for my check.  clearing the table is fine, but seriously?  it's completely rude and i think after we dropped $200.00 and only took up about 45 minutes of their time, they could have waited- especially since there were plenty of empty tables around us.  will never go back.", 
            "we planned to have dinner with our friends who live in vegas on one night of our two night stay there recently. after scouring the restaurant recommendations from my friend, we decided on nobu. sometimes i have to be in the mood for sushi, i don't always crave it like other people i know, so i was worrying about committing to a reservation. i was also worried about having to pay a million dollars (slight exageration; i don't even have a million dollars, and if i did, i would only spend half on wine) for any good wine. (true story, i made the mistake of ordering a glass of wine at the bar in the casino at the flamingo (don't ask) one night and it had me wishing for manischewitz.)\n\nok - back to the matter at hand: nobu has now made me crave sashimi, sushi and all japanese food all the time. not only did the server rattle off, in detail, and totally and completely from her memory, just about every item listed on the menu, but the food was amazing. i die. we had a smattering of everything from each \"category\" and honestly, went a bit overboard, but it was a meal well worth going over board on. \n\nwe dined on:\n\n-edamame\n-<mark><mark>Lobster <mark>Miso Soup</mark></mark></mark>\n-tempura fried rock shrimp <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> type of delicious citrusy, creamy sauce\n-<mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> (out of this world)\n-red <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark> (also, amazing)\n-salmon <mark>White Fish <mark>Scallop <mark>Salmon <mark>Oyster <mark>Beef <mark>Yuba Sashimi New Style</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark> sashimi, which was lightly seared and served with green onion, absolutely delicious\n-<mark>Soft Shell Crab</mark> roll\n-spicy <mark>Big Eye Tuna Roll</mark> (cause, come on, you gotta round out the meal)\n\nthe dessert was good but unremarkable. i'm more about the main event.\n\ncap that <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> amazing gin cocktail that i now forget the name of and two glasses of hellaciously expensive, but delicious, sauvignon blanc, and this is one of the top meals i have had in my little life thus far... \n\nin short, take your gambling winnings to nobu and order everything the server suggests.", 
            "perfection. i love sushi and have been to several nobu restaurants (both new york locations, san diego, bahamas, los angeles) and this place is my favorite. i've been to this nobu over 10 times and look forward to returning. \n\nthe food at any nobu is consistently out of this world but what makes this location my favorite is the staff. not only can each staff member be a model but everyone on staff is attentive, efficient, and interesting. \n\nthings to order:\n- yellowtail jalepeno sashimi\n- butter lettuce cod\n- <mark>White Fish <mark>Scallop <mark>Salmon <mark>Oyster <mark>Beef <mark>Yuba Sashimi New Style</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark> toro sashimi\n- negi toro hand roll \n- kobe sashimi with hot rocks\n- rock <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark>\n- <mark>Soft Shell Crab</mark> special \n- <mark>Artichoke Salad</mark> (without noodles)\n- yk35 sake\n- peach bellini\n- japanese whiskey flight \n- coconut-lime sake\n- <mark>Bento Box</mark>\n\nlast time we were in we had andrew as our server. super great guy. he gave us some excellent recommendations and was very friendly and professional. i'm going to request to sit in andrew's section every time i go back. \n\nof course i wish nobu wasn't so expensive but i still think it's well worth every penny.", 
            "not really impressed with nobu. we dined at their hard rock location with 4 people last night and our expectations were not met. it's not that the quality is bad, but for the money you spend you simply expect more.\n\nfor starters we had the <mark>White Fish <mark>Scallop <mark>Salmon <mark>Oyster <mark>Beef <mark>Yuba Sashimi New Style</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark> salmon sashimi and the yellowtail jalape\\u00f1o sashimi. both were very good. however, the rolls we ordered afterwards left a lot to be desired. \n\nthe ambience could also be a lot better. the design reminded me more of a japanese ramen kitchen."

            "nobu is easily my favorite place to dine in las vegas.  i've been told their traditional sashimi and nigiri offerings are fresh and tasty, but i wouldn't know, because nobu offers up so many unique south-american influenced japanese dishes that i only order from their special items.  i recommend you do the same; you didn't come to vegas to be boring and unadventurous, so why change now?\r\n\r\nthe star of the menu is the broiled black cod <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark>.  when you go, check with the waiter to see if this dish is available with the phyllo dough wrap; if it is, order it that way and prepare for the best thing to ever enter your mouth.  also great are fresh <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark>, <mark>White Fish <mark>Scallop <mark>Salmon <mark>Oyster <mark>Beef <mark>Yuba Sashimi New Style</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark> sashimi, and <mark><mark>Nobu's Moriawase Sashimi Salad</mark></mark> with matsuhisa dressing.  \r\n\r\nmy rating is 1 star shy of a perfect score only because eating there burns a serious hole in my wallet (this ain't todai after all); if only it were not as expensive, i could go more often to feast on the delicious food.", 
            "nobu is a great place to splurge when you have time and want to have good japanese food.  a few quick notes about how to eat there.\n\n1, i've heard the omikase is excellent. it's a safe way to try a nice selection of things.\n2, be nice to your waiter, and it will make all the difference. in general, be nice to the person that brings you your food, and you'll have a better, healthier, more hygenic meal, but here, being nice can mean great service, good advice, and a wonderful experience. i have 1 friend who is a waiter there, and if he can't serve me when i go, i make sure one of the other folks who has helped him wait on me before is my waiter, and i've never had a bad meal, bad location, or bad service.\n3, the black cod <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark>, and hamachi <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> and ponzu are  musts on the menu. i also recommend the squid pasta, rock <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark>, <mark><mark>Nobu's Moriawase Sashimi Salad</mark></mark>, and spicy <mark>Big Eye Tuna Roll</mark>.  the spicy <mark>Big Eye Tuna Roll</mark> there is the best version i've ever had.  the black cod is probably the best treatment of cooked fish i've ever consumed.\n4, enjoy the celebrity spotting. i actually sat next to wayne brady (a very nice guy, and super polite to the staff) at one dinner, and tiffany amber thiessen was there a different night. i can't say the same nice things about her that i mentioned about wayne brady.\n\nall in all, a great meal.  and get the nigori sake...best bang for your buck alcohol wise, and very tasty.", 
            "i was really ready to give nobu an average rating - how much can you really pay for fish?  how good could it really be?  it really is that good.\n\ni was in vegas for a bachelorette party <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> girlfriends, and we went to nobu.  i'd been to nobu next door ages ago in nyc...and i thought it was good but not outstanding.  apparently they save the good stuff for the \"real\" restaurant.\n\ni was underwhelmed by the resaurant decor - it seemed a little bit like any generic japanese restaurant.  but the food was awesome.  we had the tuna <mark><mark>Nobu's Moriawase Sashimi Salad</mark></mark> - tuna was so good and the salad dressing was awesome (i love japanese salad dressing), hamachi <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> peppers, salmon sashimi with chives (loved it - and i'm not even a huge salmon fan), miso cod (liked it...but definitely loved the sashimi more) and the real winner i wasn't expecting was this <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark> dish...  tiny pieces of friend shrimp covered in some sort of mayonnaise-y kind of sauce.  delish.  \nto accommodate some non-fish eaters, we got chicken which was fine, but really, who goes to nobu for chicken?  \n\ni may have to take out a second mortgage on my non-existent house, but it was worth it...",

            "amazing!!! were the first words i thought of when i was dining and leaving this restaurant.  my best friend recommended this restaurant as we were planning our vegas trip.  i didn't think much about this place when he brought it up, my expectations were pretty much non-existent.  once we got to the restaurant, it was top notch from start to finish.  we ordered quite a bit of different dishes and it was delicious down to the last bite.  our waiter was quite helpful with our decision making and recommendations.  first dish on our table was the fresh <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark>.  this dish is awesome!  the flavoring along with the fresh yellowtail easily makes this my favorite dish at this restaurant.  we also had the monkfish pate, <mark><mark>Nobu's Moriawase Sashimi Salad</mark></mark>, black cod <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark>, broiled yellowtail collar; <mark>Creamy Spicy Crab</mark>, rock <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark> <mark>King Crab with Amazu Ponzu</mark> and creamy spicy sauce.  all around delicious dishes with great visual presentation.  their lychee martini is also worth a mention, a tasty treat.  i highly recommend this restaurant for those who haven't tried it yet.  this is easily one of my top 10 restaurants.  just a wonderful experience from beginning to finish!", 
            "our first stop during our trip to vegas this past week. we decided to come here to celebrate my aunties birthday! my cousin and i have heard so much about the place we had to try it with our mother's during our mother/daughter trip to vegas.  here is what we ordered\n\nyellowtail w/ jalapeno (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tcwmgoiv0pxqkwe1sybiwq?select=dwkr-lhpvr9kfivr4q7ptq: very delicious, my mother and cousin who do not eat sashimi even enjoyed the dish. after the dinner when i asked them what their favorite dish was this was on the top. it is slices of yellowtail sashimi w/ a type of ponzu sauce and good to eat with the small slice of jalapeno and cilantro. i think i've had similar dishes like this at other restaurants but i think b/c its from nobu it just makes it that much better. \n\n<mark><mark>Nobu's Moriawase Sashimi Salad</mark></mark> (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tcwmgoiv0pxqkwe1sybiwq?select=12qbnh80ncnjdby_mzvnog): the dressing on this salad was very good and tasty. it comes with mixed greens in the middle and like seared ahi layering the outside. i wish it had a couple of different types of sashimi in the salad but that's okay, it still tasted good. \n\n<mark>Scallop</mark> with filo on lettuce cups (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tcwmgoiv0pxqkwe1sybiwq?select=nk22wem6xycmo21jvgpjvq): this was probably my favorite dish. the scallop melted in your mouth and the taste was pretty good. i think the <mark>Scallop</mark> were made with a miso sauce and had green onions sprinkled on top. whatever it was it was super super good. ahhh drool.\n\nwhole deep fried cod or snapper i don't remember the name of the fish on top of sauteed veggies in a miso butter sauce (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tcwmgoiv0pxqkwe1sybiwq?select=vefn4poi2zsbdznyhzaaxq): this was another special. the waiter told us that everyone raves about this dish. it came out and we were all in awe. it was pretty big. the table was in wow when my mother and my auntie started laughing... they then asked one of the waiters how much it was $100.00.. wow, didn't realize that when we ordered it. i think it should have been something that the waiter said, especially since it cost so much.  needless to say the fish was delicious! you can eat almost every single piece of it. the fins where crunchy and were very good dipped in the miso butter sauce. the sauce was sweet with a little spicy. the sauteed veggies were also very good and eaten with the fish heavenly. we picked at this dish the whole dinner and still weren't able to eat the whole thing.  bummer b/c we definitely tried, we knew we had to get our moneys worth if we were going to spend $100 on one dish. \n\nsushi and the tempura dinner: nothing spectacular about either of these dishes. i don't even remember what rolls we got except for the house roll which wasn't anything special. i would definitely skip both if you are coming here. get these at some other restaurant. \n\nthe service was good but not spectacular. they have a lot of people working here but nobody went out of their way to enhance our experience. \n\noverall i would come here again. there are a couple other things i would like to try off their menu.", 
            "this is my second time here and both times i've come with my cousin. as much i love nobu, i only go there with her, since she loves it so much, but i never regret it. \n\nthe nice thing is i just let her order, since she knows what's good, but then if i ever go alone, i won't really know what to order. i did have a nice acai cocktail to start the night. it was delicious and refreshing, great way to start the meal. \n\nwe ordered the <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> which i loved since i love the spice. then we had the seafood spring rolls which weren't on the menu, but since they go there all the time, they knew about it. those were also really good, along with the <mark><mark>Nobu's Moriawase Sashimi Salad</mark></mark>. loved the dressing and there was so much sashimi! we also had the rock <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark>, which was kinda like popcorn shrimp, but really tasty <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> grilled beef thing. \n\nat the end, we ordered the <mark>Bento Box</mark>, which was a flourless chocolate cake with green tea <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark>. everything was really good, but service was a little slow. my other friends were also there and they were a party of 10. they started a little after us but finished before us!! other than that though, it was a great night.", 
            "i've been dying to try out nobu and matsuhisa in la for the longest time, but the thought of making a drive that far just for sushi just couldn't be justified...until now. nobu is actually a japanese fusion restaurant, so for all of you purest out there, this is not your dining of choice.\n\nnow for the food...the ingredients are what make japanese food such a delicacy. and when it comes to seafood, especially sashimi, if your stock isn't fresh, i can taste it. that said, we decided to stuff our faces for the true nobu experience. \n\n*the yk50 is a semi-dry and rather sweet sake that was super light\n*<mark>Shishito Peppers</mark> - grilled peppers w/ an extremely simple miso sauce w/ toasted sesame\n*tuna tataki. great sauce, perfect w/ the daikon and garlic chips.\n*kumamoto oysters. not the best i've had, the sauces actually took away from the natural sweetness of this variety of oyster.\n*yellowtail sashimi w/ jalapenos. probably my favorite of the meal. extremely simple sauce w/ a spicy bite. my mouth is salivating just thinking about it :p\n*<mark><mark>Nobu's Moriawase Sashimi Salad</mark></mark>. we got a tuna/hamachi mix instead. it had a delicious miso dressing on a medley spring mix\n*amai ebi. it was a little oily this time, but the shrimp was ridiculously fresh.\n*crunchy roll w/ king crab. probably my least favorite of the night. it was creative though with the crunch topping that gave a nice twist on the typical roll.\n*tempura plate. the <mark>Vegetable</mark> were so sweet, it didn't even require the tentsuyu (tempura sauce)\n*fried shrimp w/ butter ponzu sauce. butter and ponzu is an amazing combination. so its not typical japanese but definitely try this one if you get a chance. \n\ni do believe i've never truly experienced a food coma until tonight.", 
            "every detail was covered, from a rich broth of <mark><mark>Lobster <mark>Miso Soup</mark></mark></mark> with clams to lovely service from a friendly server. he was really informative and helped us pick through the menu. the interior is contemporary japanese and beautiful. and the food was fantastic.\n\nwe had a tasty hamachi <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> slices. i've had this dish at other places but nobu slices the jalapenos paper thin and dresses the fish in a fantastic sauce. their rendition also includes a cilantro leaf and i'm a huge fan of the herb. great balance of flavors and quality of fish.\ntuna <mark><mark>Nobu's Moriawase Sashimi Salad</mark></mark>. this is a mountain of crisp salad with the sashimi draped around the base. it's a little technically difficult to eat because i wasn't sure how to get it all in one bite. but the salad was delicious and the tuna was, of course, amazing.\nblue fin toro <mark>Yellowtail or Salmon <mark>Blue Fin <mark>Toro Tartare</mark> with Royal Ossetra Caviar</mark></mark>. i think toro needs to be eaten as sashimi/nirigi or over rice as chirashi. mincing it up seems wrong.\n\nand the highlight was the <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> dish with seven spices and liberal amounts of clarified butter. holy gawd!! this was fantastic!! it was an explosion of flavors in your mouth and utterly, indescribably delicious. they split the <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> in half, cook the meat in large chunks, and then place it back into the shell. it makes for a beautiful presentation yet the tender chunks of meat are easy to remove and eat.\n\ninterestingly, i've been to other nobu restaurants and the menu is strikingly similar. i don't know why, but that seems odd.", 
            "maybe it's becuase i live in a state not known for it's seafood -- but nobu consistently has the best sushi and fish i've ever eaten.     it is the first reservation i make when going to las vegas or dallas for work.  \n\nyep it's pricy but i have dreams about it -- it's that good !!   and i've even paused my television when i saw some psuedo celebs eating there on some reality tv show -- when they were eating my favorite things.\n\nthe trick is really to just get the good stuff -- it's over the top fantastic but when i try new stuff it never quite lives up to the others ..\n\n1,  <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> -- get at least 2 orders -- i could eat 3-4 by myself if i really tried hard.\n\n2.  black cod <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark> -- either version (in lettuce cups or not)\n\n3.   tuna <mark><mark>Nobu's Moriawase Sashimi Salad</mark></mark> -- yum !!!\n\n4.   any other sushi -- but if you get rolls - i suggest you pay extra for rice paper instead of seaweed (did this cuz one friend is allergic to seaweed and it makes the fish stand out).\n\n5.  rock shrimp\n\n6.  <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark>\n\n7.  <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark>\n\n8.   <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark>\n\n9.   <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark>\n\n10.  <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> \n\n(did you get it yet ???)\n\nand the service is always top notch !!!    attentive and knowledgeable ....   and the drinks are fantastic too !\n\nit is a spendy dinner -- but in my opinion -- totally worth it !!!", 
            "bluf...the dining highlight of my trip to vegas with my girlfriend was our dinner at nobu.  this was my third trip to nobu, each time having had the chef's omakase tasting menu.  nobu's tasting menu is a thoughtfully composed meal served kaiseki-style (sort of a themed meal) that seeks to tie together individual dishes by attributes like taste, texture, and temperature to enhance the overall experience of the meal.  since there isn't a set menu, you select the price point you're willing to pay and the chef and the kitchen staff prepares an appropriate amount of courses using whatever exotic ingredients they deem fit.  we both received 9 courses with sake pairing. \n\nfirst course:  we started with a kumamoto oyster wrapped in <mark>Smoked Salmon</mark> topped with a osetra caviar, served on an endive leaf in an asparagus \"boat\" with accompanied by sweet <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> miso sauces.  a masterful start!  the 5 basic tastes were tastefully and elegantly captured together in a single dish! \n\nsecond course:  shima-aji sashimi served in a tosazu (vinegared sardines) gel\\u00e9e with micro celery and \"sea grapes\" kelp...garnished with pickled turnip.  a great all-around dish, but the pickle turnip was the ingredient that put it over the top!\n\nthird course:  bluefin tuna sashimi topped <mark>Squid 'Pasta' with Light Garlic</mark> pur\\u00e9e and sliced serrano chilies with jalape\\u00f1o emulsion over brown rice salsa.  i love sashimi, but the garlicky goodness and spiciness from the chilies was amazing.  the brown rice salsa was damn tasty in its own right!\n\nfourth course:  <mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> and seared sweet shrimp <mark><mark>Nobu's Moriawase Sashimi Salad</mark></mark> served with m\\u00e2che, peppercorn, <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Whole <mark>1/2 Maine Lobster</mark></mark> <mark>Roasted Poussin with Spicy Lemon</mark></mark> dressing.   another success!  the peppercorns gave it the spicy notes that greatly accented the raw fish.\n\nintermezzo:  a <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark>...a simple yet refreshing palate cleanser that marked the transition from cold dishes to hot.\n\nfifth course:  pan-seared seabass, seasonal mushrooms, and wild ramps served in a <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> sauce.  as much as i loved the seabass, the earthy mushrooms and ramps nearly stole the show in this dish!\n\nsixth course:  grilled wagyu beef with seared <mark>Teppan Style Foie Gras</mark> served over yellow sweet corn and snap peas <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark>-mirin reduction.  the oh-so-tender australian-raised wagyu beef paired nicely with the perfectly seared <mark>Teppan Style Foie Gras</mark>.  \n\nseventh course:  dashi <mark>Inaniwa Pasta with Lobster</mark> and enoki mushroom with japanese greens.  so simple, yet such an incredibly satisfying dish!  they didn't skimp on the lobster, either.  in many ways, this was my favorite dish of the night.\n\neighth course:  a selection of sushi...otoro (fatty tuna), tasmanian sea trout, <mark>Sea Eel</mark>, a fish i can't recall, mirugai (geoduck), and tamago (egg omelet).  i love sushi.  i loved all of these nigiri!\n\nninth course:  shiso (?) panna cotta with strawberry \"caviar\", an understated but very satisfying closer to our meal.  the \"caviar\" was made to resemble ikura or salmon roe and was a very nice, creative touch.\n\nas for our sake, chris (i think that was his name), our lead server, informed us that nobu imports its sake from japan and that it's made especially for nobu.  i'm not an expert, at all, on the finer aspects of sake.  suffice it to say, our pairings were very nice, with subtle, yet interesting differences between each glass and went well with each dish.  chris did a great job all-around job taking care of us.  we had a very leisurely meal, never feeling rushed, but we never had to wait for our next course or glass of sake.  the timing was impeccable!\n\ni'm really not the type of person to toss out superlatives casually, but our meal was arguably one of the best meals i've ever had...at least since i've started yelping!  each dish was memorable and no single dish clearly stood out as the best since they were all outstanding!  it takes a lot of hair-splitting to even pick a dish that was less satisfying that the rest but if i had to pick one, it was the wagyu and <mark>Teppan Style Foie Gras</mark> course...and that was only due to the impression that the accompaniments on other dishes were more exciting than the sweet corn and snap peas.  if you're in vegas for one night and can only eat at one place while you're there, go to nobu and have the omakase tasting menu!  you won't regret it!", 
            "nirvana - pure nirvana. my taste buds were happy, i was very happy. \n\nmy bf too me here (my first trip) for our saturday night dinner. we knew when we walked in that we were having the omakase. i truly cannot pick out one single dish that i liked over the others - every single one was executed perfectly. our waiter was kind enough to write down what we had so we could remember. though he didn't write down the sake pairings we had - every single one of them matched perfectly with the dish. my only sadness with the sake is that i can't buy it anywhere since it is made for nobu (perhaps time to sale it at the restaurant???) \n\ncourse 1: kumomoto oysters, wrapped in <mark>Smoked Salmon</mark> with osetra caviar, served with endive <mark>Tuna (Big Eye) and Asparagus</mark> in sweet and spicy miso sauces (sweet and spicy? oysters? what is not to love?) \n\ncourse 2: <mark>Shima Aji</mark> sashimi served in tosazu gelee with micro celery and sea grapes kelp; garnished with pickled turnip (i'm not normally a turnip fan, but you could serve this to me anytime!) \n\ncourse 3: bluefin tuna sashimi topped <mark>Squid 'Pasta' with Light Garlic</mark> puree and sliced jalapeno, served <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> emulsion over brown rice salsa (okay a truly unique dish - and it was spicy! you know i like spice in my life!) \n\ncourse 4: <mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> trout and seared sweet shrimp <mark><mark>Nobu's Moriawase Sashimi Salad</mark></mark> served with mache, peppercorn, <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Whole <mark>1/2 Maine Lobster</mark></mark> <mark>Roasted Poussin with Spicy Lemon</mark></mark> dressing. (this fish was so succulent, buttery and full of flavor - if only i could find this in dc) \n\ncourse 5: pan seared seagrass, seasonal mushrooms, wild ramps, served in <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> sauce \n\ncourse 6: grilled washu beef with eared <mark>Teppan Style Foie Gras</mark>, served over yellow sweet corn and snap peas <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark>-mirin reduction \n\ncourse 7: soup with huge chunks of lobster (yup - huge); loved the little enoki mushrooms in it! \n\ncourse 8: sushi: one standout for me - salt <mark>Fresh Water Eel</mark> with this leaf that kinda tasted like basil <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Whole <mark>1/2 Maine Lobster</mark></mark> <mark>Roasted Poussin with Spicy Lemon</mark></mark> together. wow - yummy (this from the girl who wouldn't eat eel for a long time). not that the other offerings weren't good. \n\ncourse 9: dessert. panna cotta (i think) with strawberry caviar - the caviar was awesome! \n\nfinal: three types of fruit sake. my favorite was the ginger. \n\ni have to say this was one of the highlights of our trip. thoroughly enjoyed the meal and would gladly go again and again.", 
            "oh nobu - mi amore!!  \n\ni've been to this restaurant countless times and it is always amazing!   after my recent visit i realized i have to give proper respect and yelp my love for them.  here are some of my favorites:\n\ntoro <mark>Yellowtail or Salmon <mark>Blue Fin <mark>Toro Tartare</mark> with Royal Ossetra Caviar</mark></mark> - this dish makes me want to commit a felony.  if i were on death row it would be my last meal, i would definitely die happy.  as one of my favorite sayings on howard stern perfectly stated, this dish will make you 'go ahead and release the poison'.\n\n<mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> - always fresh and delicious!  i believe that all other sushi restaurants have tried to duplicate this dish but can never quite get the perfect flavor. \n\n<mark><mark>Nobu's Moriawase Sashimi Salad</mark></mark> - bam!  the dressing is off the chain, the tuna beyond fresh.  \n\nkobe beef toban yaki - i'm not a religious person by any means but i'm certain the heeled hands of jesus came down and prepared this dish himself with the blessing of his father.\n\nof course you cannot go there without consuming a couple of their saketini's.  why can't any other bar/restaurant get their saketini's to be this delicious??  they are alone worth a visit there.",

            "i spent $1000 for six people.  i took clients here when i was in town for business, and one of my clients wanted to go.   i wanted to hate it, being so trendy and all, but the fact is...i loved it!\n\nmy partners wife knew one of the chefs cousin who works in los angeles,  and he came out to greet the table.  he asked what we were looking for and we told him...just give us your best \"omakase\" style meal.  i don't know if the fact that we knew his cousin influenced the food or not but the whole experience was awesome.  \n\njust a few of the memorable items were:\n\n1. <mark>Shishito Peppers</mark>, fried and delicious- i had never even heard of these before...where have i been.\n2. a plethora of sashimi plates with various spices and sauces, especially the <mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark>.\n3. kobe beef on hot rocks, beef is served raw on sizzling rocks and you cook it yourself at your table.\n\nwhen i go for sushi, i usually go alone or with one other person.  i sit at the bar and make sure the chef serves me what he recommends.  i don't want sauces,  i want perfect fish.  normally i don't go for this fusion stuff.  \n\ni have to say the fish was great and the fusion was a nice change of pace.  i do live near malibu, and i have never been to the malibu nobu.  maybe i will give it a try.  \n\nit was definitely  a fun and tasty night!", 
            "i've been dying to try out nobu and matsuhisa in la for the longest time, but the thought of making a drive that far just for sushi just couldn't be justified...until now. nobu is actually a japanese fusion restaurant, so for all of you purest out there, this is not your dining of choice.\n\nnow for the food...the ingredients are what make japanese food such a delicacy. and when it comes to seafood, especially sashimi, if your stock isn't fresh, i can taste it. that said, we decided to stuff our faces for the true nobu experience. \n\n*the yk50 is a semi-dry and rather sweet sake that was super light\n*<mark>Shishito Peppers</mark> - grilled peppers w/ an extremely simple miso sauce w/ toasted sesame\n*tuna tataki. great sauce, perfect w/ the daikon and garlic chips.\n*kumamoto oysters. not the best i've had, the sauces actually took away from the natural sweetness of this variety of oyster.\n*yellowtail sashimi w/ jalapenos. probably my favorite of the meal. extremely simple sauce w/ a spicy bite. my mouth is salivating just thinking about it :p\n*<mark><mark>Nobu's Moriawase Sashimi Salad</mark></mark>. we got a tuna/hamachi mix instead. it had a delicious miso dressing on a medley spring mix\n*amai ebi. it was a little oily this time, but the shrimp was ridiculously fresh.\n*crunchy roll w/ king crab. probably my least favorite of the night. it was creative though with the crunch topping that gave a nice twist on the typical roll.\n*tempura plate. the <mark>Vegetable</mark> were so sweet, it didn't even require the tentsuyu (tempura sauce)\n*fried shrimp w/ butter ponzu sauce. butter and ponzu is an amazing combination. so its not typical japanese but definitely try this one if you get a chance. \n\ni do believe i've never truly experienced a food coma until tonight.", 
            "this is nobu. what else can i say? this was one of the very first real fine-dining establishments i visited when i first arrived in las vegas. you can't even imagine. at nobu, i first tried tiradito, <mark>Shishito Peppers</mark>, edamame, hot sake... the list goes on. gourmand i was not. enter nobu, one of the best dining experiences i've had to date in this city.\n\neverything is great, obviously all of the sashimi, ceviche, tiradito, everything is sublime. i mean, nobu matsuhisa invented miso black cod, hello!\n\ni will say this, it is mighty expensive. and you kind of have to accept that you won't leave here full. or at least, i never have. i am no high roller. but believe me, it is all worth it.", 
            "the bar for nobu was set pretty high after trying the full omakase experience at kabuto the night before.  i did my yelp homework and scoured previous reviews, making note of the oft recommended items, and went in knowing exactly what my friend and i would order.\n\nwe ordered a gamut of different dishes: <mark>Shishito Peppers</mark>, edamame, wagyu beef, jalape\\u00f1o yellowtail, rock <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark>, lamp chop, otoro and salmon sashimi, miso black cod. \n\ni thought i was assembling a nobu all-star meal; what we ended up with was a mediocre and extremely overpriced meal.  for every dish that we  ordered, i could list a superior counterpart at japonais or sunda in chicago for a fraction of the cost.\n\nalso of note is the fact that our waiter initially remarked that sashimi orders came as two pieces, but when we got our bill, we noted that our four bite-sized slices of otoro came to a total of $76.  the wagyu was also incredibly overpriced for what we got; apparently each ounce is $30 or so and the minimum order is 2 ounces.  \n\nmaybe it was the sheer excellence of the previous night's meal, but we left feeling we had blown $350 on a very unsatisfactory experience.  even at half the price, the value would be questionable.",

            "four of us dined at nobu on feb 28th. i was very disappointed in the quality, texture, and flavor of the seafood dishes. also, the waitstaff seemed rushed and it was extremely loud. those two elements combined made it a very chaotic ambiance. we ordered $400 (overpriced) worth of food and drinks. the following are dishes i had sampled.\n\nspicy miso lotus chips <mark>Nobu Crispy Rice with Big Eye Tuna</mark> & scallop - the chips were crispy and not oily. the tuna was ok. the <mark>Scallop</mark> were not. something was off.\n\n<mark>Shishito Peppers</mark> - i loved these peppers. they are full of flavor yet not spicy. i could snack on them all day. \n\n<mark>Mushroom Soup</mark> - this tasted meaty and delicious.\n\ntoro (blue fin) <mark>Toro (Blue Fin) <mark>Yellowtail and Scallion</mark></mark> sushi roll - i did not like this at all. the texture of the fish seemed off to me.\n\n<mark>Sea Urchin</mark> nigiri - the texture and flavor was ok.\n\n<mark>Chicken Kushiyaki</mark> (teriyaki & anticucho) - ok. a bit dry and overcooked. \n\nteriyaki <mark>Tenderloin of Beef</mark> - good.",

            "nobu is easily my favorite place to dine in las vegas.  i've been told their traditional sashimi and nigiri offerings are fresh and tasty, but i wouldn't know, because nobu offers up so many unique south-american influenced japanese dishes that i only order from their special items.  i recommend you do the same; you didn't come to vegas to be boring and unadventurous, so why change now?\r\n\r\nthe star of the menu is the broiled black cod <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark>.  when you go, check with the waiter to see if this dish is available with the phyllo dough wrap; if it is, order it that way and prepare for the best thing to ever enter your mouth.  also great are fresh <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark>, <mark>White Fish <mark>Scallop <mark>Salmon <mark>Oyster <mark>Beef <mark>Yuba Sashimi New Style</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark> sashimi, and <mark><mark>Nobu's Moriawase Sashimi Salad</mark></mark> with matsuhisa dressing.  \r\n\r\nmy rating is 1 star shy of a perfect score only because eating there burns a serious hole in my wallet (this ain't todai after all); if only it were not as expensive, i could go more often to feast on the delicious food.", 
            "fresh <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark>\r\nspicy miso scallop chips\r\ntuna tataki <mark>King Crab with Amazu Ponzu</mark>\r\nblack cod <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark>\r\n<mark>Tenderloin of Beef</mark> \"to-ban\" yaki\r\n\r\nbest. dinner. ever.\r\n\r\noh, and did i mention lindsay lohan with her new hard rock beau and bodyguards. good times!", 
            "nobu is a great place to splurge when you have time and want to have good japanese food.  a few quick notes about how to eat there.\n\n1, i've heard the omikase is excellent. it's a safe way to try a nice selection of things.\n2, be nice to your waiter, and it will make all the difference. in general, be nice to the person that brings you your food, and you'll have a better, healthier, more hygenic meal, but here, being nice can mean great service, good advice, and a wonderful experience. i have 1 friend who is a waiter there, and if he can't serve me when i go, i make sure one of the other folks who has helped him wait on me before is my waiter, and i've never had a bad meal, bad location, or bad service.\n3, the black cod <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark>, and hamachi <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> and ponzu are  musts on the menu. i also recommend the squid pasta, rock <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark>, <mark><mark>Nobu's Moriawase Sashimi Salad</mark></mark>, and spicy <mark>Big Eye Tuna Roll</mark>.  the spicy <mark>Big Eye Tuna Roll</mark> there is the best version i've ever had.  the black cod is probably the best treatment of cooked fish i've ever consumed.\n4, enjoy the celebrity spotting. i actually sat next to wayne brady (a very nice guy, and super polite to the staff) at one dinner, and tiffany amber thiessen was there a different night. i can't say the same nice things about her that i mentioned about wayne brady.\n\nall in all, a great meal.  and get the nigori sake...best bang for your buck alcohol wise, and very tasty.", 
            "only complaint is that san francisco doesn't have a nobu!\n\ngreat meal. we went with chef matsushisa's omakase menu and gave the chef no limitations with food or money...so it ended up being a little pricer that we thought. none the less...amazing and worth every cent!\n\nstaff was very knowledgeable with the sake selection.\n\nsome favorites:\nblack cod <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark>\nlive scallop\n<mark>Sea Urchin</mark>\n<mark><mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark></mark>\ntoro with spicy miso and caviar\n\natmosphere is lively and loud.", 
            "i wish all of my meals in vegas were this good.  i don't even know where to begin.  the yellow tail <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> that i was allowed to taste was delicious.  i could have ordered 5 plates of it alone and been happy with my meal.  thankfully being with the group i was with that wasn't allowed to happen and i enjoyed several other items from the menu.\n\nfor myself i ordered the chilean sea bass with a <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark> rub, the <mark><mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark></mark>, uni nigiri, and scallop sashimi.  the sea bass had a very mild flavor although the <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark> was tasty.  i think grilling sea bass rather than steaming it brings out the buttery flavor that it naturally has much better.  the <mark><mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark></mark> was great and i could have had a couple more but i held off so i could enjoy my entire meal.  the uni was good, although i don't think the wait staff would be able to tell you whether the uni is good that day or not if you asked.  i'm sure the people preparing the meals would just opt not to serve the uni if they happen to not be able to get some good stuff in that day.  at least i hope so.  the surprise of the meal was the scallop sashimi. it was presented beautifully in a little hollowed out lime cup.  with a dash of soy and wasabi the flavor was amazing.  i really should have gotten at least one more order.\n\ni was also able to try some of the tempura rock shrimp, miso black cod, and the wagyu beef.  all were great but the wagyu beef and miso black cod were crazy delicious and will be must order items the next time i eat at nobu.\n\nfor dessert i had the hibiscus sorbet with champagne jelly and rock candy.  the popping of the rock candy (pop rocks) in your mouth with the flavor of the hibiscus sorbet and champagne jelly was more fun than some of the yelp events i've been to.", 
            "when i die - i want to come back as a black cod <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark>.\n\nwhy, you might ask?\n\nso that when someone eats me, i can give back the warm fuzzy feeling i get from this dish.  whoa.  \n\nhands down, off-the-hook, delish!  bring your ass here - and don't forget the benjamins.", 
            "maybe expectation is too high on the name 'nobu'.\nthe black cod <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark> was just okay - nothing special really.\nthe sushi is good. nothing really 'wow' me.. \nwe had tapan's dinner too... again.. it was so-so. \nthe bill came to 170 for the 2 of us. \noh.. talked about the atmosphere. it's noisy and not well decorated at all =(", 
            "i read all the reviews in our room (at the hard rock, no less) before deciding to eat here for dinner with my sister. i was curious to try out the black cod that a lot of people were raving about. \nstarted off with salmon nigiri (salmon was buttery and excellent) and pomegranate martinis (too weak; tasted more like koolaid). we shared the black cod <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark> and the baked <mark>Creamy Spicy Crab</mark>. the cod was rich and buttery but the sauce was just a tad too sweet so i had to scrape it off the skin. if we had rice, i wouldn't mind at all. the crab was delicious and there was huge meaty chunks of it. however, the creamy baked sauce was a little on the salty side--again, a bowl of rice would've fixed that problem. the service was alright and the decor was fab.", 
            "if we overlook the fact that the restaurant wrote down our reservation for 10 for the wrong night, my group's dining experience here was exceptional and we were pleased that they were still able to seat us despite this error. the service was incredibly fast (3 people from our group were late and we completely finished our meal by the time they arrived,) and the food was fabulous. the flavors were crisp, unique, and every bite of food was like an explosion in my mouth. since we shared all the dishes we ordered, that pretty much means that we only got one bite so we savored it for all that it was worth. damn you nobu for being so expensive! otherwise i would have ordered 2 of everything!\n\na couple of dishes i would recommend trying are:\n-<mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark>\n-toro tartar <mark>Yellowtail or Salmon <mark>Blue Fin <mark>Toro Tartare</mark> with Royal Ossetra Caviar</mark></mark>\n-black cod <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark>\n-rock <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark>\n-new zealand mussels with the garlic sauce\n\n***the must try dish is the fish/<mark>Lobster <mark>Tuna <mark>King Crab <mark>Vegetable <mark>Salmon Nobu Style Taco</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark>!!!***\nthey are not on the menu here, but you can special order them and they are awesome. i have pictures to prove it.", 
            "amazing!!! were the first words i thought of when i was dining and leaving this restaurant.  my best friend recommended this restaurant as we were planning our vegas trip.  i didn't think much about this place when he brought it up, my expectations were pretty much non-existent.  once we got to the restaurant, it was top notch from start to finish.  we ordered quite a bit of different dishes and it was delicious down to the last bite.  our waiter was quite helpful with our decision making and recommendations.  first dish on our table was the fresh <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark>.  this dish is awesome!  the flavoring along with the fresh yellowtail easily makes this my favorite dish at this restaurant.  we also had the monkfish pate, <mark><mark>Nobu's Moriawase Sashimi Salad</mark></mark>, black cod <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark>, broiled yellowtail collar; <mark>Creamy Spicy Crab</mark>, rock <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark> <mark>King Crab with Amazu Ponzu</mark> and creamy spicy sauce.  all around delicious dishes with great visual presentation.  their lychee martini is also worth a mention, a tasty treat.  i highly recommend this restaurant for those who haven't tried it yet.  this is easily one of my top 10 restaurants.  just a wonderful experience from beginning to finish!", 
            "have faith.\n\nthat's all i can say about this place.  have faith, and trust, that they will knock your socks off!!\n\neverything was smooth and heaven, even if the portions aren't that big.  don't worry, the flavors will satisfy you.  every bite was a small explosion in my mouth.  every bite made me jizz a little bit in my pants.....and it's only 8 at night!!\n\nthings you have to try:\n-<mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark>\n-toro tartar <mark>Yellowtail or Salmon <mark>Blue Fin <mark>Toro Tartare</mark> with Royal Ossetra Caviar</mark></mark>\n-black cod <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark>\n-rock <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark>\n\nand\n\nfish/<mark>Lobster <mark>Tuna <mark>King Crab <mark>Vegetable <mark>Salmon Nobu Style Taco</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark>!!!\n\nif you don't see it on the menu, just ask for it.\n\ntrust me, just do it!", 
            "this was the first time ever i've dined with three other yelpers so i'm curious to see where the other reviews come in. personally, four stars is a little high but i really enjoyed three dishes and didn't dislike anything so i'll give it four, albeit unenthusiastically. (i don't think i've ever typed a longer word than \"unenthusiastically\").\n\nthe black cod <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark> was the highlight. the kobe beef was amazing too but we all misread the menu and when that showed up at $192 i'd call it hands down the most overpriced thing i've ever eaten. the <mark>Scallop</mark> topped <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> were the third great dish. the sushi was fine though nothing spectacular.\n\nthe ambiance is surprisingly boring, especially for vegas. it looks the way a japanese restaurant might if designed by the high-school drama department - all cheap bamboo reeds and sloppy wood structures. and the service, though efficient, was humorless. any waitress who can't understand the genius in asking if there are any beef-based <mark>Dessert</mark> off the menu is not winning any points with me.\n\nstill, the price minus the kobe was totally reasonable, especially for vegas. and the matsuhisa martinis go a long way toward <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> up to a pretty good meal.", 
            "wow. i was seriously impressed with this place. this place ranks second to french laundry on my list of favorites. \n\nfirst- if you are a first time visitor there, i would recommend just ordering off of the menu. i am sure the omakase is great but you have to try the signature dishes- and you may not get to try them all with the omakase. \n\nsecond- don't have the sushi be your primary focus. it's okay- but the other items are so much better. we saw people around us doing nothing but order sushi- what a waste! \n\nthird- the warm dishes tended to be larger portions than the cold and raw dishes. just a fyi if you want to budget your appetite and your wallet. i also felt that the dishes with a tart factor (see below) were too overwhelming. i would pass on these- imo the tartness is so much you can't enjoy the other flavors that might be there. \n\nwe started with edammame and the sheshito peppers. pass on the edamamme - there is nothing great about it- and you don't need to fill up your tummy with average stuff. the sheshito peppers were really good. they taste like small green bell peppers and the miso and sesame sauce on top has a great flavor. my husband is so picky when it comes to veggies and he even enjoyed this. my only word of caution- occasionally you get a spicy one! \n\nso we relied on our fellow yelpers and ordered the following items: \n\n1. <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> - definitely get this- it was awesome! \n\n2. the blackened miso cod- by far, the highlight of the evening \n\n3. chilean sea bass- cooked the special of the day way (yummy)- it had tomatoes, and onions, some white wine sauce \n\n4. kobe beef on skewers- pass- it was okay but not great \n\n5. <mark><mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark></mark>- pass- the tartness was way too overwhelming \n\n6. red <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark> - pass- again, tartness too overwhelming \n\n7. then we ordered some basic filler items- tempura, sushi (ca rolls and ama ebi)- all which were fine. \n\n8. we ordered the <mark>Bento Box</mark> dessert- it was ok- not fantastic. \n\noverall- the meal was great. the <mark>Black Cod Miso</mark> cod was so good- it had the right blend of sweetness with saltiness, and the fish was so tender it literally melts in your mouth. the chilean sea bass had the same texture and effect, but it costs about twice the amount as the black cod (a tidbit for those of you who are watching the $$s). \n\nwe had starved ourselves earlier in the day and were totally stuffed by the end of the meal. the whole meal with tip was just over $300. i highly recommend this place. it was the only restaurant that we went to in the older part of vegas that was great.", 
            "in case people don't know, nobu is the restaurant chain of a chef, nobu matsuhisa who has starred on that food channel show, \"iron chef.\" he has brought the gourmet \"new japanese\" cuisine to the world. this place is very expensive...but the taste is extraordinary. the black cod <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark> melts in your mouth. every dish is a work of culinary art. the service at the las vegas restaurant is excellent. they constantly make sure everything is clean, and ready, glasses filled, and your needs are met. the bill for 6 of us was $270 before tip, so this is costly, but not too over-priced. it is definitely an upper echelon restaurant. the las vegas venue is situated in the middle of the hard rock hotel and is therefore several decibels too high. if you eat there frequently you are going to lose your hearing. that is why i give it 4 stars. i can imagine this restaurant outside of the hard rock hotel will be more pleasant. if you're in your 20-40's you'll probably give it 5 stars.", 
            "i was in vegas for my birthday and my friends and i went here for my birthday meal. everything was delicious! my favorites were the yellow tail <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> and the black cod <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark> sauce. amazing! our waiter wasn't very friendly but the food made up for it. i will definitely go again!", 
            "food was stellar. the black cod lettuce <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark> may have perhaps been the single best food item i have ever eaten. it had sweet, spicy, cold, hot, crunchy, soft all in one bite. amazing. sadly, the two beef items we ordered medium rare came out closer to medium well. inexcusable at these prices. the final dish we ordered took over 40 minutes and service took a nose dive after first few courses. again, this is inexcusable to spend $800 for five people and not get stellar service.", 
            "all i have to say is.....\nblack cod with dried miso lettuce wraps =ftw!\n\nmy family decided to go a bit fancy and tried nobu at the hardrock in las vegas and i have to say, \"wow!\"  the food is amazing!  \n\ni have learned that at places like these, you know you are going to spend money.  so, why not eat the \"speciality\" things they are known for rather than food you can always get at another restaurant.  so, i ordered the yellow tail <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark>, the salmon tataki with cilantro dressing, <mark><mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark></mark>, and my favorite thing in the whole wide world= the black cod <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark> lettuce wraps!  \n\nomg!  this fish was amazing.  i didn't want to stop eating the lettuce wrap and never wanted it to end!  \n(i know it sounds very sexual but once you have this dish, you too will feel like you had a sexual encounter in your mouth!  -that's what she said!)\n\ni say if you ever have that one night when you want to go fancy while your in vegas and don't mind spending the money and want a very delicious experience, you need to go to nobu at the hardrock!  \n\nonce again let me say this again!  \nyou have to try the black cod with dried miso lettuce wraps!", 
            "it was saturday night in vegas, we wanted sushi, and nobu didnt even cross my mind until my boyfriend made reservations for the same night. i quickly logged on to yelp to check the latest reviews as i do with any restaurant, and i am happy to say that i am ecstatic i did this, because had i not, i would have missed out on the black cod <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark>.... which is without a doubt, one the best things that i have ever tasted. \n\nmy bf and i shared 4 dishes and 1 dessert, washed it down with 2 sapporo's each, and by the time we were done, we could barely walk!\n\n<mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> - delicious!!!! the sauce may be just a bit overpowering but delicious nonetheless. i couldnt even taste the jalapeno :)\n\n<mark><mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark></mark> - i have no clue why they are calling this \"ceviche\" but i wish we would have ordered something else instead. it was merely ok,  it just kind of tasted like cold <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> lettuce - but hey, i love <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark>  its all good :)\n\nblack cod <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark> - omg - i just got goosebumps thinking about this dish. it is hands down the best thing i have ever put in my mouth. i like how crunchy <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> it is..  delicioso~\n\n<mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark> roll - your basic roll ..  \n\n<mark>Bento Box</mark> dessert ( flourless chocolate cake with green tea <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark>) yum yum yum yum - this is a great combination - not too much,  shared <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> special is a perfect way to satisfy your sweet tooth.\n\nwill definitely come back - loved the all male service - everyone was really nice and our waiter pretty much gave us his thoughts on all the menu items and gave us some nice suggestions - that in hindsight, i should have taken.\n\n but hey, theyre's always next time!!", 
            "aaaahh... what can i say. nobu is awesome. service was great as well. we ate several years ago at nobu atlantis and had a bad experience however decided to give nobu vegas a chance- boy are we glad that we did. had the yellowtail  and <mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> sashimis - so yummy. for hot dishes had the black cod <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark> and <mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> again. so delicious. weren't that hungry since we had a late lunch at the pink taco also in hrh (which was not good food) so we were full after 2 cold and 2 hot and had to pass on the rolls which looked great.", 
            "if it were only about the sushi, nobu would get 5 stars from me. but, i knock off 2 stars for service. we walked in on a saturday night and got seats at the sushi bar, which is the place to be. we went with our sushi chef's suggestions, which were nobu's <mark>House Special</mark>, including \"new-style sashimi.\" these consist of the best fish, <mark>White Fish <mark>Scallop <mark>Salmon <mark>Oyster <mark>Beef <mark>Yuba Sashimi New Style</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark>, with delicate sauces and garnishes: <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark>, live octopus with a peruvian chili paste, whitefish and salmon <mark>King Crab with Amazu Ponzu</mark> sauce, tuna <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark>-mustard sauce. everything was first-class, including the junmai daiginjo sake.\n\nthen, i ordered the <mark>Bento Box</mark> chocolate cake dessert. we were told it would take 8 minutes to cook. no problem - our bellies were happily full of sashimi. 20 minutes later, however, still no dessert, and we finally were able to flag someone down to check on it. another ten minutes went by. our waiter then came out to tell us there was a mixup in the kitchen and our cake went to another table. he tried to give us a plateful <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark> to tide us over - this didn't go over well, as the last thing we wanted was to eat a plateful <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark> and then a chocolate cake. another ten minutes or so, the dessert came out. it was excellent, but frankly wasn't worth waiting over half an hour for. we ask ed for the check while still eating...took another ten minutes...gave the credit card and another ten minutes went by...waiter came out to tell us the credit card isn't clearing and do we want to give another card? by this point, well over an hour had gone by since dessert was ordered and we just wanted to leave already. \n\nwhen our check finally arrived, they did charge us for the dessert that took over 30 minutes to arrive at our table. when i mentioned this to the server, he took it right off the bill. but i was miffed that i even had to ask - the right thing to do would have been to take it off in the first place.\n\ntoo bad, since up until we ordered dessert we were very pleased with the sushi our wonderful chef served us. even for a saturday night in vegas, the service was unacceptably unresponsive for such a high-end restaurant.",

            "nobu in vegas is the gold standard of sushi for me. the only place i've had that was better was o ya in boston. the service here is super friendly, i've sat at the bar, their sushi bar, and their tables. don't be surprised to see a celebrity eating here. i sat next to a bunch of yankees once.\n\nas far as the food goes, you can't go wrong with any of the sushi. my favorite dishes are the rock shrimp and black cod <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark>. must go here f you're n vegas.",

            "skip nobu if you've been to any other location. the atmosphere was very la and kind of snobby. it's a place to see and be seen and sadly this is applicable to the food as well. the menu was confusing and it almost felt like this was done on purpose in order to force the diner to chose the chef's tasting menu. we decided against it (at $100+ per person, we felt we could do better). we chose the <mark><mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark></mark>, <mark>Nobu Crispy Rice with Big Eye Tuna</mark> tempura roll and the <mark>Lobster <mark>Tuna <mark>King Crab <mark>Vegetable <mark>Salmon Nobu Style Taco</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark> to start. the tacos were insanely delicious and everything hit the mark quite well. these composed the \"cold\" dishes that nobu offers and then we moved on to the hot dishes which included kobe beef tataki style, black cod <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark> as well as some sashimi. the kobe beef was incredible and literally melted in our moths and it's no wonder the cod is a famous dish - it was delicious. looking at the menu now i'm uncertain as to why we felt the way we did, but i remember being less than enthused about dropping a few hundred dollars and not feeling like i got real value from our money. the atmosphere was cold and had it been a little friendlier perhaps we would have felt differently. the food felt like a celebrity chef was overseeing it, but you could tell this restaurant was a chain given how gimmicky everything was. sad because there's such a brand behind this name and they're just not living up to it.",

            "when i criticized morimoto napa for being like a \"vegas restaurant,\" i now realize i was astral-projecting into the future and referring to this one.  chef nobu has a signature, peruvian-influenced style, and it seems to be coupling proper technique and great ingredients with a bunch of overpowering and discordant flavors.\n\nuni tempura is amazingly good, although the price ($16 for one piece) and the questionable accompaniments (the obligatory deep-fried shiso leaf) put it far down the value-for-money l<mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark>.\n\nthe tataki plates of kobe-\"style\" beef are great and totally worth the price.  they're an especially great maneuver for large parties, since the steak is so thinly sliced it's easily shared.\n\nking crab tempura is nicely made but there's way too much acid from the ponzu.\n\nthe same goes for the <mark><mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> Salad</mark>; it's far too acidic, the flavor of the <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> lost.  but the pasta aspect was nice; great texture.\n\nthe black cod <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark> is probably a reverse of the chef's intentions:  it's really miso with black cod.  miso is a tricky ingredient; in this dish it's just completely overpowering; it seems like approach is to simply rub the miso on directly.  that's a risky tactic and it doesn't really pay off; it was hard to get through more than a few bites.  and i *love* miso.\n\nmaki in its various forms are served with -- incredibly -- a side of ponzu sauce.  that's a first for me.  i'm not sure i get the logic behind it.  the special house rolls e.g. with jalape\\u00f1o are tasty enough, but generally the <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> flavors don't complement the fish very well.\n\nthe sushi itself is perfectly made.  the knife work <mark><mark>XO and Jamon Iberico</mark> <mark>Beef <mark>Crab Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> preparation and rolling are impeccable.\n\nnobu is a bit flashy and it's to be expected from a restaurant chain that's co-owned by a celebrity chef and an actual movie star.  it's also to be expected from las vegas.  \n\ni'd certainly recommend nobu for the more traditional fare:  it's essentially authentic and very well-made.  i don't think i'd recommend much beyond that.  japanese cuisine, being one of the greatest in the world, doesn't need fixing or innovation.  nor does it need an <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> side of ponzu sauce.",

            "i was skeptical, but nobu delivered. i just finished dinner with a friend of mine and i had to write a review before i forgot the details. let's just get to the chase.\n\nmy friend and i walked in and i asked our server what the best three dishes were. he then recommend these three. i felt like a stuck up food critic requesting the chef hit me with his best shot. but i often do this for restaurants that i've never been to. after dinner, i find myself recommending the same. here's the pro and cons:\n\n1) toro carpaccio- okay, $70 for six pieces of fish can be a little on the steep side, but hey, i had to know what it was about. now i know and here's the scoop. the toro is incredibly delicious. it is amazingly tender, quite possibly the most tender toro i've ever had. the fish alone is a star, but the flavor profile that the chefs prepare is pretty impressive too. capers, truffle shavings, truffle oil <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> dressing over greens really hit the mark. i will say that there was a little too much soy sauce for my taste (that's right, i'm chinese and i'm saying it). i would request they served the sauce on the side, but fear they will substitute excess soy sauce with hate.\n\n2)<mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark>- this was almost my favorite dish of the night had it not been for the sheer flavor of the toro. the yellowtail is served as one would expect from an expensive sushi restaurant: fresh, flavorful, tender and seasoned according. the jalapeno slice was perfect- excellent spice without burning my mouth. i would actually recommend this as a first dish. \n\n3) <mark>Black Cod Miso</mark>- i thought this was a little overrated by the other reviews. cooked to near perfection, the cod was warm inside but seared and slightly crispy outside. the miso glaze wasn't much to look at. for me, it resembled gravy. i've seen others' pictures and theirs looks much nicer. nevertheless, the dish was great. i actually prefer black cod cooked slightly medium, but cooked to the core with awesome texture. sweet miso sauce finished off the dish and made it very enjoyable. \n\n4)<mark>Sea Urchin</mark> sashimi or sushi!!! just order it. \n\nmy friend and i were pretty hungry and ordered other dishes but i must say that they didn't exactly knock me off my feet. overall, many of the other dishes were very good, but just not amazing. here's the list:\n\n-<mark>Salmon Skin</mark> hand roll- thin slices of <mark>Salmon Skin</mark> with gobo, rice and seasoning. nice to have a place serve quality over quantity when it comes to the <mark>Salmon Skin</mark>.\n\n-baracuda <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark>- $40 for six slices of barracuda. very interesting texture as i haven't had barracuda before. the lemon/citrus sauce was a bit too much. again, i see this as how the chef intends the dish to be enjoyed, so i simply eat and keep my comments to myself. \n\nlive scallop- again, great cut of <mark>Scallop</mark>, but nothing special to write home about. it was nice that it was served with muscle in ponzu sauce. \n\n<mark>White Fish <mark>Scallop <mark>Salmon <mark>Oyster <mark>Beef <mark>Yuba Sashimi New Style</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark> oyster- four pieces of kumamoto oysters served ready to enjoy. so you have to eat it the way they prepare the seasoning.\n\ncrispy rice w/ <mark>Nobu Crispy Rice with Big Eye Tuna</mark>- for lack of a better term, it's japanese tatter tots. square rice cubes deep fried served with essentially tuna poke. well prepared, tasty, but nothing special. \n\nall in all, it was a great experience. my general assessment is that nobu serves dishes with strong flavor profiles. not exactly my cup of tea. maybe i'm a fond believer that less is more and that the fish should speak for itself. however, i can appreciate the fact that a chef's dish is his own art. so i eat with an open mind and share my interpretation. hope this helps.", 
            "nobu should <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> letters to the end of its name: e-n-o.  \n\nthe food here tastes better than mcdonald's but worse than chipotle, but i would rate mcdonald's higher due to it being a better value.  we had the tasting menu <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> sushi.  the <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark>, along with every other cold dish, followed the same formula: raw fish + cilantro hidden underneath a pile of salt. the black cod <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark> and the beef tenderloin tasted like bad halloween candy.  everything was either drenched in salt or drenched in sugar, or both.  the sushi was not inedible, it was on par with the kind of sushi you can get from any two-dollar-sign sushi restaurant.  it's pretty hard to mess up sushi to the extent that they messed up their other dishes, since chefs have less artistic license when it comes to sushi.  then again, it's hard to mess up <mark><mark>Lobster <mark>Miso Soup</mark></mark></mark> and theirs was the worst i've ever had (way too salty).  service was good.  \n\nour bill, including tip, came out to nearly $600 for three people.  so if you want to trick your non-asian friends into believing that their palates lack the sophistication to appreciate expensive asian cuisine, nobu is the place to go.  or sometimes when you're feeling masochistic, you just want to get punched in the face.  that's when you go to nobu.  \n\nthere are many reasons to go to nobu, but edible food is not among them.  if you want good food, there are some great french options in the area, such as le cirque.", 
            "food 4-star\nservice 4.5 star\nambiance 3 star\n\n<mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> and black cod <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark> are truly rave-worthy. sushi was fresh and sake delicious. had an excellent server. decor is surprisingly non-descript - much prefer the decor of nobu in midtown by far. ambiance was fairly toned down, perhaps due to off-strip location.", 
            "extensive menu with fusion of s american and japanese (reminded me of roy's).  very friendly staff.  yellowtail with jalape\\u00f1os tasty but a bit of a soy bite; sweet tuna on chips but not spicy as advertised; eggplant <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark> was spot on - toasty, juicy, salty, silky, warm. miso with crunchy green onions and silky tofu was great. <mark>Spicy Seafood Soup</mark> with tons of fresh seafood and mushrooms.  veggie tempura was good, but nothing too special outside of the wild mushroom - yumm!  finished up with assorted mochi - mint chocolate, mango, cherry blossom, pistachio.\n\nno wifi. bathrooms outside restaurant - shared with hard rock hotel, really?", 
            "it is hard to find good quality fish in las vegas being that we live in a desert and our nearest lake is radioactive. but nobu manages to find some high quality and good tasting fish. so far this is the only japanese restaurant in a casino that i have actually liked.  \n\nthe bluefin toro tartar was really fatty which i love and it was sitting in a wasabi sauce that was amazing. with the caviar on top it is one of the single best bites of food i have had. \n\nif you go i would stick to the specialty items on the menu and not order the sushi. you can get near equal quality sushi for less money at other places and it will fill you up faster so you wont get to enjoy their menu as much. also, the black cod <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark> was sooooooo good. the fish melted in my mouth and didnt fall apart when i put a fork to it. \n\nthe saki selection is small but the ones we tried were great.\n\nthe lack of 5 stars is due to the fact that we ordered <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> was soaked <mark>Bone in Ribeye 24oz Nobu Sauce</mark> and there was no resemblance of fish in the dish. everything else we had we loved though.", 
            "perfect end to our epic girls vacay!\n\ni want to give a special shout out to our server who rocked (pun intended). the service was phenomenal! \n\nour theme of the weekend turned out to be lmfao's 'sorry for party rockin' and when we told our server he let us keep our zen rocks, get it? rocking! aw, good times.\n\nmust haves:\n- black cod <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark> \n- toro sashimi (shout out to our waiter who helped me trick my friends who were squimish about trying fatty bluefin tuna belly. he told them it was compliments of the chef. after they fell in love with it we told them the truth and enjoyed a good laugh about it.)\n- <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark>\n- spicy <mark>Big Eye Tuna Roll</mark> \n- dessert: the chef's tasting platter was so yummy that someone swooped on a part of mine. they even put candles on it for the girls birthdays.\n\ni would also like to note that the presentation of dishes was extremely entertaining. their descriptions are as magical as the flavors. i want to give a special thanks to the server who served jessica h.'s dish with such an amazing description that it left the entire table wishing we had ordered chicken teriyaki.\n\nat this point i must admit that our two large daigijo sakes prevent me from making any other recommendations. i can honestly say that the food and service were amazing and the tab was worth every penny. i cannot wait to go back or perhaps try the nyc location.\n\nside bar:\n\nbathroom situation: i hated that the bathroom was outside the restaurant and is shared with the not so lovely patrons of rehab day club. at least hard rock was nice enough to install a syringe disposal. \n\non the bright side we also found out that nobu will be opening a location at cesar's palace, which i think will be a much better fit for this fabulous culinary experience.\n\nthe table next to us was doing omakase style. so jelly, it looked amazing! when i go to the cesar's location i will be doing omakase.", 
            "we love going to nobu and have been to many locations all over.  we had a party of ten so i got to try many things on the menu:\n\nrock shrimp - always delicious\n<mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> - yum\nceviche taco - yum\n<mark>Imported Wagyu <mark>Lobster <mark>Tuna <mark>King Crab <mark>Vegetable <mark>Salmon Nobu Style Taco</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark>- yum\n<mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark>- okay, nothing special\nwagyu dumplings- amazing\nyamakazi sidecar- drink was pretty yummy\nchilean sea bass <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark>- ok- should have ordered the black cod\ndessert was the chefs tasting platter- this was the best part of dinner! \n\ndecor was dated- not up to current lv standards. next time we will go to the new location at caesars palace\n\nservice was mediocre. not sure what was up with the waiter. he was barely seen. we had to order from 3 different waiters because ours was nowhere to be found. it was my sister's 21st bday and we wanted to make it a special dinner, but it felt like we were ignored. thank you to the manager for making up for it.\n\noverall, i'm still a big fan of nobu, but will not return to this location.", 
            "we planned to have dinner with our friends who live in vegas on one night of our two night stay there recently. after scouring the restaurant recommendations from my friend, we decided on nobu. sometimes i have to be in the mood for sushi, i don't always crave it like other people i know, so i was worrying about committing to a reservation. i was also worried about having to pay a million dollars (slight exageration; i don't even have a million dollars, and if i did, i would only spend half on wine) for any good wine. (true story, i made the mistake of ordering a glass of wine at the bar in the casino at the flamingo (don't ask) one night and it had me wishing for manischewitz.)\n\nok - back to the matter at hand: nobu has now made me crave sashimi, sushi and all japanese food all the time. not only did the server rattle off, in detail, and totally and completely from her memory, just about every item listed on the menu, but the food was amazing. i die. we had a smattering of everything from each \"category\" and honestly, went a bit overboard, but it was a meal well worth going over board on. \n\nwe dined on:\n\n-edamame\n-<mark><mark>Lobster <mark>Miso Soup</mark></mark></mark>\n-tempura fried rock shrimp <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> type of delicious citrusy, creamy sauce\n-<mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> (out of this world)\n-red <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark> (also, amazing)\n-salmon <mark>White Fish <mark>Scallop <mark>Salmon <mark>Oyster <mark>Beef <mark>Yuba Sashimi New Style</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark> sashimi, which was lightly seared and served with green onion, absolutely delicious\n-<mark>Soft Shell Crab</mark> roll\n-spicy <mark>Big Eye Tuna Roll</mark> (cause, come on, you gotta round out the meal)\n\nthe dessert was good but unremarkable. i'm more about the main event.\n\ncap that <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> amazing gin cocktail that i now forget the name of and two glasses of hellaciously expensive, but delicious, sauvignon blanc, and this is one of the top meals i have had in my little life thus far... \n\nin short, take your gambling winnings to nobu and order everything the server suggests.", 
            "yesterday, my boyfriend and i dropped in for a late night bite. definitely a fan of the decor and the service. our waitress, misty (name on receipt) was thorough and helpful, taking time to answer all questions and providing suggestions. the rest of the evening staff was equally as attentive and descriptive. awesome team. \n\nnow, food. personally, skip the taco apps, nothing special to note there. the rock shrimp had a bit too much sauce for even that type of dish. do go for the chilean sea bass <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark>. it's perfectly cooked in a buttery-citrusy sauce bed; the <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark> on top <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> texture and will make your mouth water. a dish that is both simple yet complex on its own. also, the <mark>Uni or Oyster Shooter</mark> was absolutely delish, with the right balance of sauce and meat. i had a spicy acai cocktail which was one of the best cocktails i've had in a while!! yum. i was too tired to remember what else we had. wish we came earlier to try the rest of the menu.", 
            "so- we utilized a tasting menu purchase from groupon, and my biggest fear was that it was not going to be enough food...far from it! the dishes are all good-sized portions (frankly, more food than myself and my boyfriend would normally eat) and everything was delicious! some, more than others- the actual sushi roll was a little forgettable, but the following were amazing: yellowtail sashimi with jalape\\u00f1o, rock <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark> with creamy spicy sauce, black cod <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark>. also, the desert was delicious. \n\ni would recommend, however pricing is not for the faint of heart. it is pricey- but, i think anyone attending this establishment should know that.", 
            "i loved my food here! please see pics of my appetizer and dessert.\nthe service was wonderful from beginning to end. i had salmon wrapped pear as an appetizer. it was sprinkled with olive oil. very fresh, light and refreshing!\nto drink...a lychee martini. it was good\nfor my main course, i ordered the black cod <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark> sauce. it was scrumptious! it was flaky and flavorful. i would order this again.\ni just couldn't go to a japanese restaurant and not get sushi...so i order yellowtail with jalape\\u00f1o. it was the right amount of spicy.\ndessert...flourless chocolate cake...side of house made green tea <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark> garnished with blueberries and raspberries. phenomenal!\nmy only complaint is that it was extremely pricey. but i would still return!", 
            "nobu must be my favorite restaurant in vegas.  could it be my favorite anywhere?\n\ni brought a co-worker with me who loves japanese food.  after dinner, he said to me, \"where i grew up, we were taught not to make a religion out of food.  but, after this dinner, i may become a true believer.\"  \n\ndon't think of nobu as a typical japanese restaurant -- even though you can order sushi and sashimi.  think of it as a clever japanese inspired restaurant that takes familiar flavors and brings them to the next level.\n\nfor example, the yellowtail came as very thin, delicate slices <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> and cilantro, instead of wasabi.  the black cod <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark> is sublime.  when i asked for a second order, the waitress suggested the cod with pate in lettuce cups.  that was sublime.", 
            "i had wanted to try nobu for some time, having heard many good things about it. when i saw the $99 groupon plus the 20% off groupon was offering plus my wife's b'day to celebrate there, i knew the stars were aligned.  could it live up to reputation?\nthe food: the groupon is for a 5 course tasting menu. the meal starts with a pass out of edamame with maldon salt. a very generous portion and an excellent way to start a meal. the first course was yellowtail tuna <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> and cilantro. the tuna was sliced super thin and was in a citrus sauce. it was very tasty and different than yellowtail that i have eaten at my local sushi restaurant. things got even better after that. the next dish was rock <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark> with a creamy spicy sauce. wow, was that good! not like any tempura i have eaten before. very lightly breaded, cooked so the shrimp were soft but not mushy. and the spicy sauce was easily handled even by my gringo palate. a great dish. and a huge portion. by its size, the dish would have been enough for dinner if it was the only thing served. this was followed by the alaskan black cod <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark>. another outstanding dish. the fourth course was the sushi; tuna, fluke and salmon with a california roll. this was the weakest part of the menu - only very good. last course, dessert. i photographed the plate. a beautiful presentation with very tasty treats (and a hand written birthday greeting in chocolate). the food rates 5 stars plus.\nthe service: as soon as we were seated, our server, albert, came by to greet us, explain the tasting menu, and take our drink orders. throughout the meal, he, the busboy, and the food runner were very attentive without being overbearing. they made us feel very welcome. our water glasses were never allowed to go below half full. the table was cleared promptly. the food came out of the kitchen plated beautifully. the service was 5 stars plus.\nthe ambiance: the restaurant is nicely decorated with lots of bamboo. however, the tables for 2 were placed one on top of the other. we were there on a monday night, so the tables were never more than 1/3 full.  but our table was about 6 inches from the next table, which was 6 inches from the next in a line up of 4 tables. if the restaurant were crowded and there were people at the next table, we would have been eating with strangers. not my idea of a celebration/romantic meal. at best, 3 stars for ambiance.\nvalue: $80 for dinner of this quality is the deal of the decade. i would do it again in a heartbeat. but i would never go on a weekend night when the table next to me might be occupied (or i would go with a party of 6 or more - the bigger tables were nicely spaced out).", 
            "i have always wanted to try nobu and finally went! and it was worth the wait let me tell you! we went for my bday and did not have a reservation. we got there pretty early around 5ish so they were able to sit us without a res. our waiter jeffrey was on point. best service. he recommended we start with the <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark>. it was melt in my mouth amazing. i could live off the dish for the rest of my life. lol. it was yellowtail with the right amount of sweetness and spice. we also got the cucumber salad which was pretty good. a lot of the vinegar did go to the bottom of the bowl which made it hard to coat your salad but it was still good. we also had a sear salmon sashimi which i do not remember the name that was excellent. we got spicy edamame, <mark>Beef Kushiyaki</mark>, the black cod <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark> and the wagyu beef gyoza. the cod was really good and highly recommended. the wagyu beef was great with two dipping sauces. we literally could have kept ordering food. we had a couple of nice cocktails as well. \n\nafter dinner they brought us out a plate with happy birthday with a choc cake and green <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark>. we also ordered the whiskey moose. both <mark>Dessert</mark> were to die for and i was in heaven. \n\nwhat a fun place to go. you have people dressed to the max, casual people, people from all over the world that come and eat here. come chow down some amazing eats, listen to some funky music and watch the beautiful people. yes please!"

            "i've read about celebrities going to nobu.  my friend talked about nobu like it was a god of sorts.  when we found out we had a table waiting for us at nobu, i was ready to go and feast myself on its delights.  we ordered: the miso black cod, salmon nigiri, a <mark>Soft Shell Crab</mark> roll, the hamachi <mark>Yellowtail and Jalapeno</mark> appetizer, the <mark>Mushroom Salad</mark>, a vegetarian cut roll, and the tiradito.  to drink i had the cucumber martini.  it was seriously one of the best drinks i have ever had.  it tasted like it was made with lychee vodka, and was smooth, refreshing and not too sweet.  unfor<mark>Tuna (Big Eye)</mark> our positive experience ended there.  after waiting an hour for our table, we had ordered about 15 cucumber martinis and was dying for some water.  we sat at our table and for 9 people, 2 drink menus were placed on the table and then we were ignored.  i glanced at the menus, waited.  our waiter came by and i asked him for waters all around and food menus.  15 minutes go by.  we had no water, and no menus.  finally, we're given 5 menus for 9 people, as he handed me the last menu, he left saying \"we're a little short on menus.\"  we shared our menus and within 3 minutes he was back asking us what we were going to have.  we asked him for some suggestions, and he pretty much just brushed us off.  we finally ordered the hamachi <mark>Yellowtail and Jalapeno</mark>.  before i could order anything else, he rushes off.  the next time we saw him he is dropping of a plate of hamachi <mark>Yellowtail and Jalapeno</mark>.  pretty much the whole night, he just ran off with us halfway through ordering and as a result, we were unable to dine together.  i can only speak for the <mark>Mushroom Salad</mark> and vegetable cut roll.  the vegetable cut roll was pretty good, i mean, steamed <mark>Vegetable</mark>, wrapped in a cucumber wrap, with a little ponzu sauce.  the <mark>Mushroom Salad</mark> was pretty gross.  the mushrooms were varied; trumpets, oysters, shiitake, enoki.  the sauce it was cooked in was sour and as a result made the mushrooms taste bad.  everyone else thought the hamachi <mark>Yellowtail and Jalapeno</mark> were pretty good, and they loved the miso black cod.  everything else, however, they said was mediocre.  mediocreness is ok, if it wasn't coupled with poor service and a $400+ bill.  when the bill came, we inquired about the drinks on the bill as we thought we had taken care of them all at the bar.  his response?  \"no you didn't, but you can just take it out of my tip.\"  i secretly think that everybody raves about this place so much because they don't want to admit they spent that much money on a mediocre experience that you can get anywhere in san francisco for a quarter of the price.  overall verdict:  skip it.  the atmosphere is not really that great, the food isn't really that great, and the service should not be called service.  the pros: the cucumber martini was super good.", 
            "nobu i love you!!\n\ncame here on a vegas trip with one of the girls and this was our first stop! we dolled up, drove to the hard rock where there is valet parking, and walked into the center of the first floor where this ridiculously delicious restaurant is located.\n\nservice-great! everyone was really attentive. i always had my water filled, any finished dishes cleared off within the minute. the food came in really good timing as well. i was starving going in and i didn't have to wait. although coming from a restaurant like this i didn't expect anything less.\n\nthe decor is really comfy and not as fancy as i'd originally thought (or the other nobu restaurants apparently). you can definitely get away with begin pretty casual or dressing up your attire. while there were only small groups there they had some large tables <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> hidden rooms for even larger groups so if you need to bring a lot of people it seems as thought they'd be able to accommodate for more people.\n\nnow onto the best part of all! fooood is so worth the price!!\ndessert: lemme start with this one because i cannot get over the delicious trio of soy caramel, miso apple cinnamon donuts and a really delicious home made <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark> with toasted pecans. their pastry chef changes the dessert menu every season to go with what's in season which means i'm going to have to come here every season :)\n\napart from that we enjoyed the <mark>Black Cod Miso</mark>, eggplant miso (best i've ever had, decent portion but very rich), <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> (not spicy and very fresh!), <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark> (the garlic chips <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> great texture but the citrus oil sauce was too overpowering) and the shiitake <mark>Mushroom Salad</mark> (very strong citrus vinaigrette but delicious mushrooms to make up for it)\n\nawesome experience and a high price but definitely worth it :d", 
            "10 star if possible! this restaurant is the only reason i go to the hard rock. the food is simply amazing. you must try the miso black cod....absolute favorite of mine, <mark>Spicy Seafood Soup</mark> is delish as well as the <mark>Mushroom Salad</mark>. i have had sushi there a few times but it's not the star of the show in my opinion. the place is always busy so i suggest making a reservation. now as far as the price, it's $$$$...but you get what you pay for! ladies i suggest going with your significant other :) i will be dining there over and over again. simply amazing."

            "not worth the hype. \n\nnobu isn't a japanese restaurant, it's a new age sushi restaurant. they may have borrowed their name from new york, but that's about where the similarities end. \n\nservice was friendly, but brisk. they clearly wanted to get us in and out of there since we were sitting at the bar. \n\nwe ordered <mark><mark>Lobster <mark>Miso Soup</mark></mark></mark>, the four <mark>Kelp Salad</mark> (their version of a seaweed salad), tamago, the chilean sea bass with a dried miso sauce, and chicken teriyaki. the miso was standard, and the tamago was much larger than what i'm used to, but both were good. <mark>Kelp Salad</mark> was a little too fishy for me, but then again, i had my heart set on seaweed salad. both the chilean sea bass and the chicken teriyaki were merely good, but not good enough for the ticket ($45 and $30 respectively) and neither came with rice.\n\nso why the three stars? we just weren't overwhelmed. nobu wasn't an impressive dining experience, and in this town, if you don't have experience, why bother?", 
            "i must admit, i have not been to a nobu that i didn't like.  so yes, i am a fan of this high-end japanese chain restaurant.  we had dinner here this past friday night.  unfor<mark>Tuna (Big Eye)</mark> i am not fond of the hotel that it's located in... which is barely a step up from a hooters-type ambiance with the class-less tatted out clientele and their hoochie mama's attached to their hips.  well back in the day hard rock was the place to go to... but that was years ago.  so the fact that one has to step foot into the hard rock casino to get into the entrance of this restaurant... should really get a minus star for not strategically relocating this at a more ritzy hotel casino like bellagio or cosmopolitan.   \n\nwe started off with cocktails... lychee martini and a greyhound... can't go wrong there.  as for the app...started off with the sea salted warm edemame.  i was so hungry, i practically ate all the soy beans.  i ordered the yummy <mark>Kelp Salad</mark> and he ordered hamachi sashimi with jalepeno... so perfectly fresh <mark>King Crab with Amazu Ponzu</mark> sauce or miso... so good!  he ordered the <mark>Shrimp or <mark>Scallop</mark> with Wasabi Pepper or Spicy Garlic</mark> was sinfully delicious... (fried so not a healthy choice).  and i ordered the chilean sea bass with dried miso... my all time favorite, which did not disappoint!  salmon, hamachi and unagi sushi... small but still so good.  and we ended with yet another cocktail :-) and the <mark>Bento Box</mark>.... flourless chocholate cake with white chocolate sauce and green tea <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark>... omg!  amazing dinner with outstanding service.  yes nobu is expensive but i was for<mark>Tuna (Big Eye)</mark> that he was so generous... so not really sure what our bill was... but so worth every bite.", 
            "first of all, please choose the right nobu restaurant.  you should be going to nobu in hard rock hotel.   if your pocket book is a little tight this is not the place i would recommend you to go. \n\ncold dishes: \nspecial: toro (don't remember what he listed as the garnishes, but it is shown on my pics.  i think this dish was just a little salty. once, you <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> the dressing on top, i like to taste the fish, since it is fresh.)\n<mark>Kelp Salad</mark> 13 (this tasted so fresh, <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> just a little lemon on top of it.  also, helped w/cleaning the palette for the next course) \n<mark>Sea Urchin</mark> 16 (this is from santa barbara, ca which is normally where every japanese restaurant from the west coast gets there uni from.  hmmm..this just tasted like any uni i would have gotten at another bay area restaurant probably no more than 12.00.  oh well, i do love my uni. \n\nhot dishes: \n<mark>Black Cod Miso</mark> 37  (this was cooked well and the miso glaze on top was just right) \n\ngeez i forget the server's name, but he was really great!  knowledgeable about his fish and the menu.  very upscale and modern experience.  this is the 2nd nobu location i have been to, first was in hong kong.  if you like fresh fish w/a twist of fresh ingredients, you just have to come here and experience the taste.  but don't come here if you are looking for affordable specialty sushi rolls, this is not that type of place.  this was the first time my friend had gone to this restaurant, she said it was the best japanese restaurant she has ever been to.  i was so pleased to have taken her there 1st.  hope they do open up in san francisco soon!"

            "nobu is my favorite japanese restaurant.  ever.  so far i've been to three- this one, nobu malibu and nobu 57 in ny.  out of the three, i'd have to say ny was the best and this one the least-best.  i say \"least best\" because \"worst\" and nobu don't belong in the same sentence together.  you cant go wrong with nobu- but i did have a few gripes about my most recent experience here a couple days ago.\n\nso, of course of course you have to get the miso cod, obvie...not going to spend time describing how fabulous that dish is. in <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> to the cod, i also ordered the lychee martini, the miso eggplant, the <mark>Hearts of Palm</mark> salad with \"jalapeno\" dressing and a <mark><mark>Lobster <mark>Miso Soup</mark></mark></mark>.  if you've read my nobu 57 review, you can see that the lychee martini i had was perfect (which is why i had 3), so understandably i was excited to have it again.  however, the one i received at nobu vegas was waaaaay to strong, and i had to request <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> lychee juice to balance out the rubbing alcohol taste.  my other major gripe was the <mark>Hearts of Palm</mark> salad.  i specifically went out of my way to ask the server if this salad was the same <mark>Hearts of Palm</mark> salad <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> dressing they serve at nobu 57, and he assured me it was.  wrong.  that salad that came out was repulsive- and pretty offensive because of the over-the-top garlic used.  it tasted nothing like the marvelous h.o.p. salad at nobu 57.  and, they should call it \"blast of garlic dressing\" because after one bite i swear i smelled wretchedly of garlic for the rest of the night- and it wasn't spicy from the jalapeno at all.  oh, and not to mention the fact that it was twenty dollars.  um, yea...skip that one.  the miso eggplant was good- not remarkable, but we did eat every last bit of it.\n\nso, even with my complaints i still believe its a 4-star worthy establishment because every one of my previous experiences here have been amazing.  maybe not as good as nobu 57, but still the best japanese restaraunt in vegas, definitely.", 
            "we have eaten here twice - once on our honeymoon and once in march 2011.  we are a challenge - vegetarian and gluten free.  both times they were extremely accomodating and knowledgable.\n\nwe had tofu sashimi, <mark>Hearts of Palm</mark> salad, a mushroom rice dish, various rolls, and a flourless chocolate cake we will never forget.\n\nthe ambiance reminds me of an urban outfitter and i mean that in a great way.\n\nthe service is world-class.  friendly, appropriately casual and approachable, while also knowledgable.  \n\nthe food is fantastic.", 
            "fantastic!!! best fish i have ever had. we had truffle tuna, jalapeno yellow tail, black cod, <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> <mark>Hearts of Palm</mark> spaghetti!  it was just amazing!!!!\n\nlocated in the hard rock hotel", 
            "service at nobu is always par none! paired with my favorite standbys here...yellowtail sashimi with jalape\\u00f1o!!!! this dish is a signature and is undeniably one of my favorites in the world. super tender and the perfect combination of savory and perfect kick from the fresh jalape\\u00f1o! the rock shrimp are just amazing with a creamy sauce and again with a perfect bite at the finish. our server offered a variation of my favorite <mark>Black Cod Miso</mark> cod- small portions served on butter lettuce cups that rocked so much i ordered a second. \n\nfor our special adventure we opted for the <mark>Hearts of Palm</mark> pasta- again a kick and for me interesting but not a fav yet clarence loved it! last and should have been first was their <mark><mark>Lobster <mark>Miso Soup</mark></mark></mark>- probably the best anywhere , served piping hot and i enjoy it as a finish. \n\nthe wagyu beef was so tempting but i passed. it is hard for me to order a dish equivalent to two new pairs of shoes... honestly we have never been disappointed in a nobu splurge. i was pretty full before the table next to us ordered it and caused me to have food envy but there is always next time. \n\naaron was a super knowledgable and very attentive. the team of secondary servers were all on point. huge kudus to the whole team here from start to finish with a standing o for the chef and kitchen too!", 
            "came here recently for a birthday dinner with my friends -- one was pescatarian, the other was vegetarian. we were blown away by the server who accommodated our requests and suggested some delicious menu items for the picky party.\n\nwe selected about 80% vegetarian dishes <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> seafood dishes as well. i was so impressed by how delicious everything we were presented with. \n\nif you're with a bunch of people who have numerous dietary restrictions, nobu is one of those places where they will definitely cater to your needs.\n\none of my favorite dishes of the night was the <mark>Hearts of Palm</mark> pasta. the brussels sprouts were absolutely <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> -- very different to the ones i'm used to. there's nothing generic about the brussels sprouts here.\n\nour meal for 5 people with sake was $500, with tip.\n\na really great meal with great service. our server dan was superb! btw, i just realized that it's been 10 years since my last visit. wow!"

            "despite all the hype, we decided not to go for the omakase.  turned out that the choice was not a bad one.  the three of us shared a bamboo sake order, many many appetizers, one main course, and a green tea <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark>.  i was surprised that it was under $300, and we were stuffed and satisfied.\n\nthe <mark><mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> Salad</mark> was great; you really do get an entire lobster!  the only thing we didn't love was the squid pasta salad, but it was still decent.  i was a little disappointed that for the prices we're paying, we still weren't getting real wasabi.\n\nthe service was great despite how busy it was.  i had reserved 9 days in advance but still could only get a 10pm reservation.  i was concerned that the service, selection, and quality wouldn't be up to par since the kitchen supposedly closed at 11pm, but this was not the case.  i *loved* the filet mignon with anticucho sauce, but the southerner in our group thought it tasted like weird chili.\n\ni'd give this more like a 4.5 stars.  i really didn't like the hard rock hotel, and once you step out of the restaurant, it's just way too loud, even for vegas.", 
            "i was in vegas this past weekend for a bachelorette party. and when we found out there was a nobu here (see my nyc review since i had been to that one quite a few times), we had to come! i was in charge of the ordering since no one else from the party had been there. \r\n\r\nthe decor is similar to new york's nobu, but not as big and not as nice. the service is not as good but it's vegas so oh well.\r\n\r\nwe ordered:\r\n\r\npeach martini and lychee martini - very good but strong.\r\n\r\n<mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> and ponzu sauce - this was fucking good. one of my friend's doesn't eat sashimi and she loved this dish. (see below for kristine n's review). they prepared it with about 20 pieces of sashimi on the plate for our big party! it was great!\r\n\r\n<mark><mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> Salad</mark> - of course i had to order this! i love the salad dressing. \r\n\r\nmiso black cod - the cool thing about nobu is that because we had a group of 8, they actually cut the fish in chunks and put them individually on little lettuce wraps so it would be easier to eat. this was fantastic and sweet.\r\n\r\nchilean sea bass w/ mushrooms - the bride-to-be is a sea bass connoisseur and she said this was not chilean sea bass, but just regular sea bass. it was still very good though. yummm.\r\n\r\nsquid pasta - i love the squid pasta here. complimented w/ asparagus. i love asparagus!\r\n\r\nrock <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark> - we choose the butter sauce since the other sauces had been a bit spicy. yummy.\r\n\r\n<mark>Bento Box</mark> - flourless chocolate cake with <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark>. this was better than i remembered from nyc. it's not flourless as in a chocolate bar on a plate - it actually does have a cake - souffle texture to it. it was great, and gooey in the middle. \r\n\r\nmango caramel ice-cream dessert - a light but tasty dessert with caramel bits in it.\r\n\r\none of the girls and i are not big seafood fans, but we loved all the dishes here. (see below for kristine n.'s review!) that tells ya something! everyone thoroughly enjoyed this meal which made me happy because i hoped they would trust my judgement in food. =)\r\n\r\nit was nice because they brought out each dish one-by-one so you aren't stuffing your faces all at once. by the end of the dinner, we felt extremely satisfied but not so full we were going to explode.\r\n\r\nyay, for nobu!!!", 
            "nobu is awesome. i've never been to a nobu before until this past weekend when i was in vegas for a bachelorette party. the decor inside the restaurant was pretty nice. service wasn't too bad, but it could have been a pinch better. felt like our waitress was spread out a little too thin and trying to cover too many tables, but when she was around, she gave us the time and explained things pretty thoroughly.\n\nmy favorite dish of the night was the <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> (i normally don't like raw fish, but this one was freaking awesome!), <mark><mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> Salad</mark> (i normally don't eat fields of green salad, but this was an exception!), miso black cod (very yummy), the <mark>Bento Box</mark> dessert was great (esp the chocolate flourless cake which was very soft) and the mango caramel <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark> dessert. the <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark> was lighted flavored mango and there were caramel bits in there that was just great. probably my favorite dessert that i've ever had.\n\noverall the food was fantastic. definitely would head back to nobu again next time i'm in vegas. they're opening one closeby and i'll be definitely dining there in the future.",

            "i wish all of my meals in vegas were this good.  i don't even know where to begin.  the yellow tail <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> that i was allowed to taste was delicious.  i could have ordered 5 plates of it alone and been happy with my meal.  thankfully being with the group i was with that wasn't allowed to happen and i enjoyed several other items from the menu.\n\nfor myself i ordered the chilean sea bass with a <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark> rub, the <mark><mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark></mark>, uni nigiri, and scallop sashimi.  the sea bass had a very mild flavor although the <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark> was tasty.  i think grilling sea bass rather than steaming it brings out the buttery flavor that it naturally has much better.  the <mark><mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark></mark> was great and i could have had a couple more but i held off so i could enjoy my entire meal.  the uni was good, although i don't think the wait staff would be able to tell you whether the uni is good that day or not if you asked.  i'm sure the people preparing the meals would just opt not to serve the uni if they happen to not be able to get some good stuff in that day.  at least i hope so.  the surprise of the meal was the scallop sashimi. it was presented beautifully in a little hollowed out lime cup.  with a dash of soy and wasabi the flavor was amazing.  i really should have gotten at least one more order.\n\ni was also able to try some of the tempura rock shrimp, miso black cod, and the wagyu beef.  all were great but the wagyu beef and miso black cod were crazy delicious and will be must order items the next time i eat at nobu.\n\nfor dessert i had the hibiscus sorbet with champagne jelly and rock candy.  the popping of the rock candy (pop rocks) in your mouth with the flavor of the hibiscus sorbet and champagne jelly was more fun than some of the yelp events i've been to.",

            "i really wanted to try nobu after having an amazing experience at morimoto in philly.  i was not disappointed.  we arrived promptly at our reservation time and were seated immediately.  upon being seated we were greeted by our server within moments.    the atmosphere at nobu is much different than morimoto...nobu is more lively and trendy.  \n\nthey have you order a few dishes from the three parts of their menu.  we started with the oysters and the <mark><mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark></mark> which is served in lettuce wraps.  the lettuce wraps were quite good and the oysters were very earthy tasting. \n\nfor our second course we chose the <mark>Creamy Spicy Crab</mark> and the rock <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark> in butter ponzu.  the <mark>Creamy Spicy Crab</mark> may be one of the best dishes i've ever tasted in a restaurant.  at the end of our weekend i asked my brother in law what his favorite thing was about vegas and he responded without hesitation \"eating <mark>Creamy Spicy Crab</mark> at nobu.\"  not the club, not winning $300, not seeing old friends....the <mark>Creamy Spicy Crab</mark>.  \n\nwe chose 4 sushi rolls for our main course, the house roll which is like a rainbow row except the fish on the inside, a spider roll, unagi avocado (not on the menu but they happily prepared it for us) <mark>Yellowtail and Scallion</mark>.  each of the rolls was well prepared and the fish was fresh.\n\nfor dessert we ordered assorted mochi, which caused brother in law to wet himself for the second time that night.  our assortment included tiramisu, pistachio, honeydew, and raspberry.   all were amazing.\n\nthe service was outstanding throughout the night.  the meal was well paced, it wasn't the lingering three hour affair we had at morimoto but we didn't feel rushed at any point.  in the end i felt that the bill was actually fairly reasonable for what we ordered.  including tip and alcohol it came to about $90 a person.  i do have to <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> it did bother me slightly to find that some of the customers were wearing sneakers, open toe sandals (on men) and collarless shirts.  when i made our reservation they informed me that the dress code did not include these things, which is totally fine.  i'm all for getting dressed up to go out to eat, especially in vegas, and especially at a place like nobu, but i do not like it when i go through the effort and others don't have to.", 
            "let me start by saying that the food was excellent.  the reason the place doesn't get 5 or even 4 stars is the service was not on the up and up.  \n\ni went with 5 other guys celebrating a friend's last days as a bachelor.  when we arrived we were told by our waiter that \"we don't have printed menus, but tell me what types of things you like and i'll customize the menu for you\".   odd...  this should have raised a red flag right there.  \n\n\"well, obviously we'd like some sushi.  that's why we're here.\"\n\"any non-sushi eaters?\"\na couple of guys raise their hands...\n\"yeah, bring out a chicken dish or something else non-seafood.\"\n\"okay, i'll get you guys started.\"\n\nthe waiter started bringing out food one platter at a time.  <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> salad...  kobe beef carpacio (something like that)...  some kind of tasty dumplings...  3 complete fillet mignon dinners...  and after a break...  2 huge platters of sushi!!   when all was said and done, we had been brought enough food for probably 10-12 very hungry people!  our \"customized\" menu for 6 people consisted of 5 large platters of food plus 3 complete steak dinners.\n\nwhen we questioned our waiter, his response was \"well that's what you said you wanted.\"  we certainly did not want enough food for 12 people.  by the time the sushi came out, we were all stuffed... and this was a group of 6 guys that can really eat.  of course, we were charged for all of this excessive food that ended up going to waste.  the bill was $1200...  $200 bucks a head.  i don't think i would have had a problem paying $200 for dinner, it was the fact that i had to pay for all this extra food that was unnecessary that bothered me.\n\nto <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> to injury, as we were leaving the restaurant, a table was being seated right in front of us... all the diners had menus in hand.",

            "hmmm, good fish, good food...but at what cost? i went here with my cousin and we had a nice meal with the obligatory beers and sake. we each dropped $150, and i left hungry. can i get a \"fuck you?\" it's understandable but annoying as a local when a gourmet chain restaurant charges way more in las vegas than in other cities.\n\ndidn't eat any sushi rolls, instead got some non-roll items like tataki where they basically cut up some fish, splay it out in a circle on a plate all fancy, <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> smattering of scallions, drizzle some ponzu-type sauce atop, and charge you $25. \n\ni guess it's worth it once in a while, but not the kobe beef dish. we'd been told the kobe beef was phenom, so we ordered reluctantly after seeing the price: $20/ounce, 4-ounce minimum. $80 for a small beef dish? yikes! maybe it wouldn't have hurt so much if the beef was good (great would've helped), but nope -- the beef was just some regular-assed beef, not particularly tender or flavorful. i kinda wish i'd used the $80 for something worthwhile, like a tarot reading. at least i would've seen the future, bitches!", 
            "fun experience! no privacy...: when we were seated i was disappointed that we were elbow to elbow with other couples on either side- no chance of a romantic dinner (or a private conversation for that matter). at one point the couple next to us leaned over to discuss one of our selections! the place is small <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> crowded. although i frequent japanese and sushi restaurants this menu contained many things i had never had before. most of the items are appetizer sized and quite pricey, considering the size (~$14-25). we chose items off the hot, cold and sushi sections. \nthe yellowtail tartar was great, the <mark><mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark></mark> was not so. the tempura rock shrimp were excellent, just a bunch of fried shrimp on a plate (popcorn-shrimp size). we tried the <mark>House Special</mark> (a rainbow roll) and eel sushi. both were good, but not my favorite rolls i'd ever had-actually kind of plain. for dessert the <mark>Bento Box</mark>, essentially a souffl", 
            "this was the first time ever i've dined with three other yelpers so i'm curious to see where the other reviews come in. personally, four stars is a little high but i really enjoyed three dishes and didn't dislike anything so i'll give it four, albeit unenthusiastically. (i don't think i've ever typed a longer word than \"unenthusiastically\").\n\nthe black cod <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark> was the highlight. the kobe beef was amazing too but we all misread the menu and when that showed up at $192 i'd call it hands down the most overpriced thing i've ever eaten. the <mark>Scallop</mark> topped <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> were the third great dish. the sushi was fine though nothing spectacular.\n\nthe ambiance is surprisingly boring, especially for vegas. it looks the way a japanese restaurant might if designed by the high-school drama department - all cheap bamboo reeds and sloppy wood structures. and the service, though efficient, was humorless. any waitress who can't understand the genius in asking if there are any beef-based <mark>Dessert</mark> off the menu is not winning any points with me.\n\nstill, the price minus the kobe was totally reasonable, especially for vegas. and the matsuhisa martinis go a long way toward <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> up to a pretty good meal.", 
            "i'm not going to lie--a small part of me dies every time i think about how much we spent here.  but the truth of the matter is, you can't get good sushi without paying for it.  \n\nwe ordered the $100 omakase, the uni tempura set, kabocha tempura, and salmon sashimi.\n\nthe fusion dishes (like the hamachi <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> or the snapper with cucumber <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Whole <mark>1/2 Maine Lobster</mark></mark> <mark>Roasted Poussin with Spicy Lemon</mark></mark> juice) were fun to try but i find that the sauces often overpower the fish, which is the best thing about nobu.  if you have never tried any of their signature dishes, you might want to order at least one of the omakase options, but if you're just looking to enjoy the fish qua fish, then order the sashimi and/or nigiri a la carte.\n\nand yes, let's talk about the fish.  i have never had such a wonderfully buttery miso black cod!  and the toro, maguro, aji, trout, and sake (as in salmon sashimi) simply melted in our mouths.  no biting necessary.  the only low point was that the anago in our complimentary sushi was littered with small fish bones but hey, it was complimentary!  yet another reason why i love nobu.  they know how to treat the ladies right.\n\nas for the tempura, the kabocha was out of season, so it was our bad for ordering it in the first place, but the uni tempura was unlike anything i have ever had.  every bite was bursting with succulence and the tempura batter <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> extra texture and flavor.  heavenly.  anyone who is a fan of uni and/or tempura needs to try this!  it also comes with tempura shiitake mushroom (luxuriously juicy), tempura shiso leaf (so crispy, so light), and one other <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark> that i forget but that my mom thought was delicious.\n\nthe dessert was lovely too--we had the <mark>Bento Box</mark> which consists of flourless chocolate cake and homemade green tea <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark>.  not too sweet and the perfect way to end a perfect meal.\n\ni seriously cannot wait to come back here again and try the <mark>Hamachi Kama</mark>, the snapper, the whole fried fish, and the squid salad.  is it expensive?  yes.  but is it worth it?  most definitely.", 
            "wow. i was seriously impressed with this place. this place ranks second to french laundry on my list of favorites. \n\nfirst- if you are a first time visitor there, i would recommend just ordering off of the menu. i am sure the omakase is great but you have to try the signature dishes- and you may not get to try them all with the omakase. \n\nsecond- don't have the sushi be your primary focus. it's okay- but the other items are so much better. we saw people around us doing nothing but order sushi- what a waste! \n\nthird- the warm dishes tended to be larger portions than the cold and raw dishes. just a fyi if you want to budget your appetite and your wallet. i also felt that the dishes with a tart factor (see below) were too overwhelming. i would pass on these- imo the tartness is so much you can't enjoy the other flavors that might be there. \n\nwe started with edammame and the sheshito peppers. pass on the edamamme - there is nothing great about it- and you don't need to fill up your tummy with average stuff. the sheshito peppers were really good. they taste like small green bell peppers and the miso and sesame sauce on top has a great flavor. my husband is so picky when it comes to veggies and he even enjoyed this. my only word of caution- occasionally you get a spicy one! \n\nso we relied on our fellow yelpers and ordered the following items: \n\n1. <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> - definitely get this- it was awesome! \n\n2. the blackened miso cod- by far, the highlight of the evening \n\n3. chilean sea bass- cooked the special of the day way (yummy)- it had tomatoes, and onions, some white wine sauce \n\n4. kobe beef on skewers- pass- it was okay but not great \n\n5. <mark><mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark></mark>- pass- the tartness was way too overwhelming \n\n6. red <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark> - pass- again, tartness too overwhelming \n\n7. then we ordered some basic filler items- tempura, sushi (ca rolls and ama ebi)- all which were fine. \n\n8. we ordered the <mark>Bento Box</mark> dessert- it was ok- not fantastic. \n\noverall- the meal was great. the <mark>Black Cod Miso</mark> cod was so good- it had the right blend of sweetness with saltiness, and the fish was so tender it literally melts in your mouth. the chilean sea bass had the same texture and effect, but it costs about twice the amount as the black cod (a tidbit for those of you who are watching the $$s). \n\nwe had starved ourselves earlier in the day and were totally stuffed by the end of the meal. the whole meal with tip was just over $300. i highly recommend this place. it was the only restaurant that we went to in the older part of vegas that was great.", 
            "i love sushi, so obviously i am a fan of nobu's. the fish is always so fresh and delicious. my favorite is the yellowtail with the jalapenos.\n\nwe came here for a friend's birthday. the experience was good. the bad thing was the location of our table. there was a large table with a birthday right behind us, and they were all standing around like it was a night club for at least 45 minutes. my chair got bumped several times, until i was finally so irritated, i was ready to leave.\n\nthe <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark> things with the rice paper are amazing (sorry, forgot what they are called!). oh, and try the <mark><mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark></mark> - yum!\n\nthis place is very expensive, so be prepared for the sticker shock.",

            "i went to nobu with a group of 8 people, and i was really disappointed. i really don't understand why nobu has had so many 5 star reviews. yes the food was good, not amazing. the only thing that was stellar was the black cod lettuce wraps. if i was just giving a rating on the food, i would have given it a 3 or 4 star, but the service was horrible. we came in with drinks already in hand (thanks to hard rocks round bar), were served some bottled water, and many of us made a preemptive drink order. we were so happy we did, cause it was literally 30 minutes before we were served another drink. i would try to flag our server down, but i couldn't get him. during the night, the server was not engaging at all and rarely stopped to see how we were doing. to top it all off, since we were a party of 8, our tip was already <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> on to the bill. so, the despite being a horrible server, he still got a very hefty tip. on any other night i would have asked to speak to the manager, but i just let it go. i was in vegas, with friends and didn't want to put a damper on the night.",

            "the visit was on a labor day sunday around 6pm.  the last visit to this particular nobu was back in 2003 when i didn't know the difference between a piece of foie and a rubber sole.  i recall having the chef special back then as well, but the omakase this time was definitely more enjoyable.  this was probably due to the fact that i wasn't three sheets to the wind this time.  being married does these things.\n\nthere were those that chose the bronze omakase ($100) and those that went for the silver ($150) like yours truly, and boy was there ever a difference.  there were major discrepancies between the cuts and also the types of meats served.  the sashimi and the speciality dishes also had noticeable differences.  it's not to say that the 100 dollar omakase wasn't good, but it wasn't great...at least from my vantage point.\n\nthere's about a zillion details i will be leaving out, such as the dried flakes of hoo-haa sprinkled with a drizzle of the thinger thang.  so use your imagination..\n\ncourse 1 - a bonito sashimi.\ncourse 2 - amaebi splashed with hot oil, chawan mushi with truffle and crab eggs at the bottom, kampachi sashimi with dried miso flakes.\ncourse 3 - toro sashimi <mark>King Crab with Amazu Ponzu</mark> ginger sauce <mark>Yellowtail and Jalapeno</mark> sauce topped with a bunch of edible flowers which made it all purdy and crap.\ncourse 4 - seared <mark>Scallop</mark> on a bed of sea beans.\ncourse 5 - kobe beef (served medium) with pan fried <mark>Teppan Style Foie Gras</mark>.\ncourse 6 - sushi set (nigiri) <mark>Inaniwa Pasta with Lobster</mark> broth and <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark>.  the set consisted of - toro, abalone, spanish mackerel, eel, tai (<mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark>) and tamago.\ncourse 7 - an array of sweets including <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark>, chocolate looking souffle thing, fresh fruits and other sugary confections we couldn't stay for because we were already late for the friggin cirque du pouffay show.\n\n..\n\nall in all, a great meal.  i enjoyed the silver omakase at matsuhisa better, the wife liked this dinner much better.  definitely a strong 4 star, but nowhere near a five.  the highlight of the meal for me was the foie served over the kobe.  the dish was so luxurious i really was at a loss for words as i was enjoying every delectable bite.  the slice of black truffle in the chawan mushi gives you a big mule kick in the face which was in short, heavenly.  \n\ni was surprised to find that i liked the non sushi dishes better than the raw, but is it such a huge surprise?  we live in cities like la, sf, ny, etc. where quality ingredients are so readily available.  i've had sashimi as good if not better in other restaurants.  most don't serve it with the detail and ingenuity like mr. nobu matsuhisa, but it takes way too much money to surprise this sushi cowboy.\n\ni truly don't mean to sound snobbish, but there's only so many ways to serve up a nice slab of toro.  i'm more impressed these days by the way chefs serve up foie.  and i am totally infatuated with bone marrow.\n\n..\n\ni've said too much.  \n\ni am off to eat.\n\nedit:\n\ni don't know if it was because we were in vegas, but i felt like everything was a bit contrived.\n\n*shrugs*",

            "my first visit to a nobu outpost was about 5 years ago at nobu next door in new york city.  at that point i was still evolving into the foodie that i am today, and for some reason, i absolutely loved the hot spot.  the food was innovative; the atmosphere was exclusive; and snagging a table was a super-heroic feat.  in the years that have passed since, nobu has expanded, and i have also eaten at their nobu 57 in manhattan and the vegas location.  as food culture and my passion for it have evolved, so has my dislike of nobu.  this chain has lost its unique luster, and the quality of the dishes has become a mixed bag.  while some hot and cold courses are better than others, almost anything beats their sushi, which tastes like something ordered from a supermarket's counter.  \n\nmy sushi-fanatic friend and i recently booked a trip to vegas, and her sister had insisted that she try nobu.  i knew that my friend was focused on it, so i went along with the recommendation, though i knew better.  we wound up heading there on our first evening, which at least paved the way for better and better meals as the vacation progressed.\n\nour reservation enabled us to get a table at the crowded spot, and we were immediately seated at a prime location in the center of the dining room.  my friend ordered a glass of sangria, while i opted for a fruity martini, which was so horrifically sweet that i needed to exchange it for a basic glass of sauvignon blanc.  the wine also turned out to be very acidic and not at all similar to the waiter's description.\n\nin terms of the food, we started with two appetizers.  a tiny mound of cool, fresh salmon tartare was immersed in a small bowl of fragrant miso oil and topped with a generous helping of salty caviar.  i am very picky about my tartare, judging it by the amount or lack of flavor it exudes.  this particular version was surprisingly well-seasoned and delicious.  we also sampled one of my favorites - the rock <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark> with spicy sauce.  the succulent fried balls of rock shrimp melted in our mouths, and the spicy mayo sauce <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> a creamy kick. \n\nmy friend stayed firm on our ordering sushi, so we requested the fusion-style <mark>House Special</mark> roll and the <mark>Spicy Scallop</mark> roll.  the <mark>Spicy Scallop</mark> one was pretty flavorful, but their house blend, which included several kinds of fish, had zero taste.  we actually sent it back and did not even bother to order a replacement.\n\nunfor<mark>Tuna (Big Eye)</mark>, i think this restaurant has lost its pizazz, and my friend was not impressed either.  i would really only recommend it for its non-sushi menu items, but even those are inconsistent.", 
            "i'm sorry i have to drop their average number of stars for nobu, well at least the one in las vegas.  i had high hopes for this place after dining at the one in hawaii.  total change of scenery here.  very loud and casual.  i should have known being that its in the hard rock cafe, but i thought people would step it up here.  had to knock off a star just for ambiance, & price (i dont mind paying high prices, but i expect a total experience for the price i pay)  \n\nhad to knock off a star for the food.  the black cod <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark> was good but my was a little slimy and quite a couple of bones i had to pick out. for the price and caliber nobu touts to be there should be no bones.\nthe glass of wine we got tasted old also.    \nluckily the yellowtail sashimi w jalepeno was still the highlight.  \n\nnot a place to get full at, expect to pay a lot, skip the edamame and bottled water, that'll <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> 20 more to your bill....",

            "skip nobu if you've been to any other location. the atmosphere was very la and kind of snobby. it's a place to see and be seen and sadly this is applicable to the food as well. the menu was confusing and it almost felt like this was done on purpose in order to force the diner to chose the chef's tasting menu. we decided against it (at $100+ per person, we felt we could do better). we chose the <mark><mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark></mark>, <mark>Nobu Crispy Rice with Big Eye Tuna</mark> tempura roll and the <mark>Lobster <mark>Tuna <mark>King Crab <mark>Vegetable <mark>Salmon Nobu Style Taco</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark> to start. the tacos were insanely delicious and everything hit the mark quite well. these composed the \"cold\" dishes that nobu offers and then we moved on to the hot dishes which included kobe beef tataki style, black cod <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark> as well as some sashimi. the kobe beef was incredible and literally melted in our moths and it's no wonder the cod is a famous dish - it was delicious. looking at the menu now i'm uncertain as to why we felt the way we did, but i remember being less than enthused about dropping a few hundred dollars and not feeling like i got real value from our money. the atmosphere was cold and had it been a little friendlier perhaps we would have felt differently. the food felt like a celebrity chef was overseeing it, but you could tell this restaurant was a chain given how gimmicky everything was. sad because there's such a brand behind this name and they're just not living up to it.", 
            "oh nobu, you are definitely deserving of a 4 star review, but alas our server (name withheld) decided that serving us wasn't in his best interests.\n\nnow before i utilize yelp to complain about sub-par service i must document the highlights, because as we know, an amazing kitchen can make up for lacking service.\n\nthe <mark>Black Cod Miso</mark> was a life changer. you owe it to yourself to have this dish.\nalso the <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> was such a wonderful combination of flavors, that honestly, i can't find words to do it justice.\n\nnow as to why nobu earned 3 stars from me instead of 4. our service lacked in every area, inattentive, unwilling to suggest menu items for our group of 5, and at times seemingly spiteful. why did you bring us (2) rock <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark>? it's delicious don't get me wrong, but two? \n\nmaybe the malice was because 2 people in our group were very late, and he was missing out on those <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> tips, or because they couldn't include gratuity? i don't know. but when i'm spending $60-70 per person, i expect a little more.",

            "my buddy and i went to nobu this past friday night at 9:30 for their omasake chef choice tasting menu. we had very few disappointments. they sat us right away at the bar, tables would have been 15 minutes even with our reservations.  lots of good energy in the restaurant, lots of japanese yelling back and forth from the waiters and sushi chefs.  we split a $50 bottle of nonfiltered very fragrant nigori sake cold which was smooth and easy to drink. the small bits of rice at the bottle of the bottle reminded me of red wine sediment as a good thing. \n\nthe first course came out quick and cold. a chilled patty of toro tartar in a soy wasabi sauce topped <mark>Yellowtail or Salmon <mark>Blue Fin <mark>Toro Tartare</mark> with Royal Ossetra Caviar</mark></mark>, served with a baby silver spoon.  it was tender, smooth, rich and melt in your mouth.  the caviar was not memorable.  an a+ start and an expensive dish on their regular menu. next was 4 pieces per plate of thin cut fresh octopus topped with a cilantro leaf, a dot of super hot sauce, finished with citrus, like ceviche.  pretty good.  next was another cold appetizer of rice paper wrapped greens with a piece of raw ebi sweet shrimp, dressed with a fantastic sesame ginger sauce with a fried prawn head on the side.  my buddy especially liked the tempura batter on the <mark>Sweet Shrimp with Fried Head</mark> and the dressing.  i will personally come to your house and kill you if you do not eat the fried prawn head. \n\nthen started the hot plates.  first was the ever famous <mark>Black Cod Miso</mark> cod, a bit too sweet for my buddy but it did not keep us from both licking the plates.  a small piece of tender fish which just went on and on and kept melting in our mouths.  flavor of fish hard to come through past miso and sweetness.  like fish candy in a good way.  my friend said that an improvement would be to torch and crisp up the skin before putting on the sauce which would give some texture contrast and make the dish over the top.  $23 on the regular menu.  next was the beef tenderloin toban yaki style with a shitake and enokitake mushrooms and a piece of thin asparagus in a soy broth. beef very lean, not as melt in your mouth as i would like.  my buddy would have liked a nice piece of ribeye cap instead but who wouldn't.  the dish is served spitting hot on a mini hot plate and when they raise the cover in front of you, the steam envelopes you warmly.  try not to get the grease on you. \n\nnext was the nigiri sushi course of 5 pieces along with a nice clam <mark><mark>Lobster <mark>Miso Soup</mark></mark></mark>. we got a piece of <mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> (mmmm), magura tuna (so tender), yellowtail (yum), clam (a bit tough) and <mark>Sea Eel</mark> which was the most tender fall apart <mark>Sea Eel</mark> i have ever tasted.  the sushi rice <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> fill you to the gills by that point and then they hit you with the dessert which was a bento presentation of a warm flowerless chocolate lava cake with lots of lava and very little cake and a very good not sweet green tea <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark>.   this just put the nail in the coffin.  we were stuffed, but we couldn't stop eating since it was so good.  \n\nthe restaurant closed at 11pm on a friday night, but we will remember the meal for a long time coming.  next time i'm in vegas i plan to make it a point to return and see what the chef choice is at that point in time.  this was the $100 omasake.  the $150 would have <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> some kobe beef and <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> and there.  we were very happy with our choice.  i think the meal was an absolute bargain for the price.", 
            "i went here with a group of girls and was really excited since i have wanted to go for a long time. the atmosphere is really great -- very zen-like. i don't eat sushi, but there were plenty of other options for me. i had the shrimp and maine <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Whole <mark>1/2 Maine Lobster</mark></mark> <mark>Roasted Poussin with Spicy Lemon</mark></mark> sauce. overall great flavor although some pieces of the <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> just a tad rubbery (which is why i dinged my review one star). i must have been really hungry that night, because i wasn't full after my main course. so it was tempura to the rescue -- shrimp, asparagus and sweet potato. that helped tremendously. i do think the service could have been a bit quicker for our drinks, which seemed to not arrive as they should have. the waitstaff otherwise was friendly and attentive.", 
            "let me preface this review by saying that i'm a huge self-admitted sushi <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> and my husband is peruvian, so nobu seemed a logical choice for our 7th anniversary dinner.  aside from the villainous penny slots  just outside the door, it was the perfect choice. \n\nwe started out with the <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark>.  yellowtail is by far my favorite raw fish and i've had a similar dish at several excellent bay area restaurants, but this was by far the most flavorful rendering of this dish that i've had. the sashimi was also not razor thin which was an awesome <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> bonus (honestly, i've gotten use to the fact that fine dining, particularly in vegas, means small portions and high prices so the amount of fish was a pleasant surprise. \n\nnext, we tried the tiradito nobu style <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> type of halibut like fish.  now, here the fish was razor thin, but came out with a dot of rocoto, a block of rock salt, the traditional lime juice and a side of cilantro.  my husband says this is exactly what tiradito is supposed to taste like, which makes me want to spend significantly more time in peru.  it was amazing.\n\nwe then moved on to the <mark>Black Cod Miso</mark> next and honestly, this was the only part of the meal that i was underwhelmed by.  i know that this is supposed to be the signature hot dish at nobu, but i've had a very similar dish at both morimoto napa and at hyakumi at cesar's palace and the texture of the fish wasn't the melt in your mouth awesomeness that i have come to expect from the dish. the flavor was right on, and if i'd never had black cod before, i would have loved it.  \n\nso, we moved back to the cold dishes and tried the <mark>White Fish <mark>Scallop <mark>Salmon <mark>Oyster <mark>Beef <mark>Yuba Sashimi New Style</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark> salmon sashimi (<mark>White Fish <mark>Scallop <mark>Salmon <mark>Oyster <mark>Beef <mark>Yuba Sashimi New Style</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark> because it's served with ginger, <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> other amazing deliciousnesss that i can't recall right now), finishing off the savory with the toro green onion maki (cut).  they were both amazing. \n\nwhat shocked me was how incredibly amazing the two <mark>Dessert</mark> we had were.  we tried the <mark>Bento Box</mark>, a flourless chocolate cake with house-made green tea <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark>, and this peach cobbler like dish with almond miso crumble and ginger <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark>.  i don't know if anyone else finds some green tea <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark> to sometimes taste vaguely like lipstick, but this <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark> was delicate and a beautiful companion to the rich chocolate cake.  the warm peaches with the crumble and (again not overpowering) ginger <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark> was a highlight of my whole trip to vegas.  (and i'm not really a dessert person)\n\nokay, this review is way too long, and i didn't even mention the impeccable service.  i can't wait to go back and wish there was a nobu in the bay area.", 
            "when i criticized morimoto napa for being like a \"vegas restaurant,\" i now realize i was astral-projecting into the future and referring to this one.  chef nobu has a signature, peruvian-influenced style, and it seems to be coupling proper technique and great ingredients with a bunch of overpowering and discordant flavors.\n\nuni tempura is amazingly good, although the price ($16 for one piece) and the questionable accompaniments (the obligatory deep-fried shiso leaf) put it far down the value-for-money l<mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark>.\n\nthe tataki plates of kobe-\"style\" beef are great and totally worth the price.  they're an especially great maneuver for large parties, since the steak is so thinly sliced it's easily shared.\n\nking crab tempura is nicely made but there's way too much acid from the ponzu.\n\nthe same goes for the <mark><mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> Salad</mark>; it's far too acidic, the flavor of the <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> lost.  but the pasta aspect was nice; great texture.\n\nthe black cod <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark> is probably a reverse of the chef's intentions:  it's really miso with black cod.  miso is a tricky ingredient; in this dish it's just completely overpowering; it seems like approach is to simply rub the miso on directly.  that's a risky tactic and it doesn't really pay off; it was hard to get through more than a few bites.  and i *love* miso.\n\nmaki in its various forms are served with -- incredibly -- a side of ponzu sauce.  that's a first for me.  i'm not sure i get the logic behind it.  the special house rolls e.g. with jalape\\u00f1o are tasty enough, but generally the <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> flavors don't complement the fish very well.\n\nthe sushi itself is perfectly made.  the knife work <mark><mark>XO and Jamon Iberico</mark> <mark>Beef <mark>Crab Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> preparation and rolling are impeccable.\n\nnobu is a bit flashy and it's to be expected from a restaurant chain that's co-owned by a celebrity chef and an actual movie star.  it's also to be expected from las vegas.  \n\ni'd certainly recommend nobu for the more traditional fare:  it's essentially authentic and very well-made.  i don't think i'd recommend much beyond that.  japanese cuisine, being one of the greatest in the world, doesn't need fixing or innovation.  nor does it need an <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> side of ponzu sauce.", 
            "so obviously if you are going here you know what to expect. we had a great experience. our server was one of the ones who went to open dubai, so we were well taken care of. he did warn us because of our reservation time (10:15p) and kitchen closing (11p), that he was unsure how they would send out what we ordered. so we were prepared. of course, if you are spending nobu money my feeling is the chefs serve until you are done. but that is the only reason for the 4th star, well and another completely over priced wine list. \n\ni have been to nobu next door in nyc, so this was a different experience.\n\nonto the food; we jumped all over the menu but stayed away from the sashimi because that seemed over priced f<mark>Premium Sushi or Sashimi</mark>. we ended up with a few hand rolls that were great because the nori was crispy (which seems tough for other places to pull off). \n\nfrom there we also had the <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark>, as always. then we had the <mark><mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark></mark>, and a couple <mark>Lobster <mark>Tuna <mark>King Crab <mark>Vegetable <mark>Salmon Nobu Style Taco</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark> as well. both good and the <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> great.\n\nmake sure you get the black cod <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark> in lettuce. awesome! just eat it straight away because it comes warm.\n\nif you haven't been, go!",

(i would never ever pay $30 for five paper-thin slices of hamachi with little slivers of jalapeno and overly acidic ponzu again), the menu was innovative, modern, and divided into clear categories to help you order a little bit of every category. the wait staff is very helpful with describing dishes, recommending dishes, and answering questions you have about the menu.\n\ncons: again, extremely frou frou japnese food. the price is not reflective of the quality of food. $40 for a tiny amount of risotto served in a fancy big plate that looks like a bowl... please. the black cod was not fresh-- it seemed like the miso was attemting to cover up the slightly old taste of the black cod... the ceviche hurt my masseters. i probably made the ugliest little puckerface from the acid in the ceviche $35 tiny bowl of ceviche. i'm fine with paying good money for good food, but honestly, nobu was a let down. if it's tiny portions, at least make them spectacular tiny portions. spectacular it was not.\n\nwe left hungry, and went for a real dinner afterwards. sorry, nobu. maybe we'll try another one of your restaurants, but definitely not las vegas.",

            "i really wanted to try nobu after having an amazing experience at morimoto in philly.  i was not disappointed.  we arrived promptly at our reservation time and were seated immediately.  upon being seated we were greeted by our server within moments.    the atmosphere at nobu is much different than morimoto...nobu is more lively and trendy.  \n\nthey have you order a few dishes from the three parts of their menu.  we started with the oysters and the <mark><mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark></mark> which is served in lettuce wraps.  the lettuce wraps were quite good and the oysters were very earthy tasting. \n\nfor our second course we chose the <mark>Creamy Spicy Crab</mark> and the rock <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark> in butter ponzu.  the <mark>Creamy Spicy Crab</mark> may be one of the best dishes i've ever tasted in a restaurant.  at the end of our weekend i asked my brother in law what his favorite thing was about vegas and he responded without hesitation \"eating <mark>Creamy Spicy Crab</mark> at nobu.\"  not the club, not winning $300, not seeing old friends....the <mark>Creamy Spicy Crab</mark>.  \n\nwe chose 4 sushi rolls for our main course, the house roll which is like a rainbow row except the fish on the inside, a spider roll, unagi avocado (not on the menu but they happily prepared it for us) <mark>Yellowtail and Scallion</mark>.  each of the rolls was well prepared and the fish was fresh.\n\nfor dessert we ordered assorted mochi, which caused brother in law to wet himself for the second time that night.  our assortment included tiramisu, pistachio, honeydew, and raspberry.   all were amazing.\n\nthe service was outstanding throughout the night.  the meal was well paced, it wasn't the lingering three hour affair we had at morimoto but we didn't feel rushed at any point.  in the end i felt that the bill was actually fairly reasonable for what we ordered.  including tip and alcohol it came to about $90 a person.  i do have to <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> it did bother me slightly to find that some of the customers were wearing sneakers, open toe sandals (on men) and collarless shirts.  when i made our reservation they informed me that the dress code did not include these things, which is totally fine.  i'm all for getting dressed up to go out to eat, especially in vegas, and especially at a place like nobu, but i do not like it when i go through the effort and others don't have to.", 
            "i was shocked to get a same day appointment at nobu and after i was done, i thanked my lucky stars i did.  the place was smaller than i expected but i found the ambiance very warm and the decor interesting.\n\ni started with the tempura tuna which was like velvet in my mouth.  smooth doesn't even begin to describe it.  little did i know that i would forget all about that when i tasted the cod.  everyone here raves about it - for good reason.  it is simply one of the most delicious dishes i have ever had.  my sister and took turns trying to con each other out of it...only a fish this delicious could spark chopstick violence between two loving siblings.\n\nthe <mark>Creamy Spicy Crab</mark> was actually both creamy and spicy...and well spicy at that.  if you are used to things being under-spiced, then you would be pleased with this dish.  tasty but not dangerous.\n\nnot much else to <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> - it is 10x better than can be described.  if you are in vegas, check it out for sure.", 
            "i read all the reviews in our room (at the hard rock, no less) before deciding to eat here for dinner with my sister. i was curious to try out the black cod that a lot of people were raving about. \nstarted off with salmon nigiri (salmon was buttery and excellent) and pomegranate martinis (too weak; tasted more like koolaid). we shared the black cod <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark> and the baked <mark>Creamy Spicy Crab</mark>. the cod was rich and buttery but the sauce was just a tad too sweet so i had to scrape it off the skin. if we had rice, i wouldn't mind at all. the crab was delicious and there was huge meaty chunks of it. however, the creamy baked sauce was a little on the salty side--again, a bowl of rice would've fixed that problem. the service was alright and the decor was fab.", 
            "it's always been a ritual to come here when ever my friends and i are in vegas. however i think some dishes are not as great as they used to be...the <mark>Creamy Spicy Crab</mark> for example was very salty and the uni was just ok. the strong dishes this time around were the washu beef, jalapeo yellowtail and the <mark>Black Cod Miso</mark>.", 
            "amazing!!! were the first words i thought of when i was dining and leaving this restaurant.  my best friend recommended this restaurant as we were planning our vegas trip.  i didn't think much about this place when he brought it up, my expectations were pretty much non-existent.  once we got to the restaurant, it was top notch from start to finish.  we ordered quite a bit of different dishes and it was delicious down to the last bite.  our waiter was quite helpful with our decision making and recommendations.  first dish on our table was the fresh <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark>.  this dish is awesome!  the flavoring along with the fresh yellowtail easily makes this my favorite dish at this restaurant.  we also had the monkfish pate, <mark><mark>Nobu's Moriawase Sashimi Salad</mark></mark>, black cod <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark>, broiled yellowtail collar; <mark>Creamy Spicy Crab</mark>, rock <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark> <mark>King Crab with Amazu Ponzu</mark> and creamy spicy sauce.  all around delicious dishes with great visual presentation.  their lychee martini is also worth a mention, a tasty treat.  i highly recommend this restaurant for those who haven't tried it yet.  this is easily one of my top 10 restaurants.  just a wonderful experience from beginning to finish!", 
            "this is a difficult review for me to write - i have regarded nobu matsuhisa as one of the most innovative chefs in japanese cuisine. maybe time is passing by and his '<mark>White Fish <mark>Scallop <mark>Salmon <mark>Oyster <mark>Beef <mark>Yuba Sashimi New Style</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark>' doesn't seem so 'new' anymore? \n\ni've had sushi at the london, dallas, and nyc locations of nobu in the past, as well as the excellent original matsuhisa restaurant in la. my visit to nobu in las vegas did not seem to compare with the others. it was great sushi, to be sure - fresh, quality cuts of fish with well-prepared 'cooked' dishes. the service during my visit was pretty indifferent (we sat at the sushi bar) and the chef we sat in front of only seemed to be going through the paces of preparing food at a restaurant that would be packed with hipsters regardless of the quality or preparation of the food. perhaps the global expansion of nobu has dulled this place - haven't seen a change on a nobu menu in years. sad.\n\nanyway, enough hatin'. i had a great <mark>Creamy Spicy Crab</mark> (excellent dish), lots of sushi - uni, konpachi, unagi, chyu-toro, kani - a portion of nobu's house sake (love the bamboo flasks there), tempura, and the exellent miso-marinated black cod. it was all good. but i'm not sure i'll seek out the lv branch of nobu in the future (it was located in our hotel in vegas). \n\ngiven nobu's prices with its growing 'chain' atmosphere and innovativeness of other places (morimoto, tyson cole's uchi), i can only give nobu-lv 3 stars.", 
            "three words: miso black cod.\n\noh my gawd. \n\nif you have to choose only 2 items from the menu, it would be the miso black cod and the miso black cod.  this is not to say that the other dishes aren't as fabulous - i would definitely recommend the chilean sea bass with dried miso, <mark>Creamy Spicy Crab</mark>, broiled tassie  trout, and <mark>Beef Kushiyaki</mark>.  \n\nthe cherry on top is the service - from the first phone call to reserve a table for 10 for a friday night dinner (made a day prior due to a reservation cock-up at social house), subsequent phone calls to organize the delivery of birthday cake, and the servers during the dinner.  \n\nall these made us forget about the $8 cake-cutting fee which, while ridiculous, is somewhat justified.  \n\nthe damage report came to about $70 per person.  money well spent, no less.", 
            "probably the best restaurant in the hrh, but very hot-and-cold.\n\nthe <mark>Creamy Spicy Crab</mark> appetizer and lotus chips were out of this world delicious.  the molten cake desert = divine.  the <mark>Spicy Tuna (Big Eye)</mark> and yellow-tail & jalapeno rolls were meh, definitely had a lot better; the seaweed seemed a bit old and the rice was over cooked.\n\nthe service there was the best i experienced in the hrh (next to the security, surprisingly awesome guys) and the atmosphere was also very nice.  i just love the concept though,  it is basically asian cuisine meets tapas.  \n\nworth it if you are staying at the hrh;  not worth seeking out... except maybe for the cake :)", 
            "authentic japanese food...no, but really good modern japanese food.\n<mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> - everytime i order this dish.  probably could eat 3 plates\n<mark>Black Cod Miso</mark> - excellent but you better eat it with rice or share it  because the miso can become overwhelming.  but that could've been the 4 bottles of grey goose the night before speaking.\n<mark>Creamy Spicy Crab</mark> - tasty but salty, again good sharing.\ncreamy rock <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark> - excellent.\nblue fin toro <mark>Yellowtail or Salmon <mark>Blue Fin <mark>Toro Tartare</mark> with Royal Ossetra Caviar</mark></mark> - excellent.\nblue fin toro <mark>Cabbage Steak with Truffles</mark> - it was a special at the time and not really worth the $100 for 6 pieces.  just order blue fin toro sushi, sometimes simple is better.\nwould venture here every other trip to lv.  haven't tried other nobus to compare but will get a chance in the bahamas.", 
            "i have to say that i was skeptical at first - i don't like the idea of paying so much at a sushi place. but my boyfriend and i were in vegas with friends so the good company was what brought us in. \n\nfor those who want a simple yes/no - yes, if you're looking for a high end place to try and you enjoy sushi than i think nobu is one of those rare places that's worth it. \n\nour party of 8 didn't really know what we wanted, so our amazing waiter suggested that he could pick out an assortment of dishes based on our budget. at $100 a person, he said he could give us the grand prix. we had dish after dish that included sushi rolls, black cod, \n<mark>Creamy Spicy Crab</mark>, etc. other people have mentioned the black cod - i would just <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> my boyfriend made a comment while eating it that every human should taste this succulent piece of ocean nectar. that cod was that good. \n\none person in our group was vegetarian, and i have to say he was getting some awesome custom dishes! so many options for vegetarians!\n\nthe food was great to say the least. the service was excellent, and the ambiance was lively yet relaxed. there was honestly nothing to complain about. since you're reading this review, i assume you don't mind the price point as long as its worth it. i would tell you that yes, it's worth it."

            "when nobu opened in new york city, it created a sensation.  reservations were nearly impossible to get, and its new interpretation of traditional japanese food was widely praised.  this led to the inevitable branding of the restaurant; nobu can be found all over the globe.\n\nmeal #1: i found las vegas nobu's sushi highly variable.  the overall quality was ok, but some items (e.g., uni) were poor while others (e.g., ankimo) were good.  orange and honey flavored sake was interesting but probably not worth repeating.\n\n\nmeal #2:  since my first meal, i went to nobu in miami beach, sat in the dining room and had the omakase meal.  i enjoyed that a bit more, so decided to give the vegas location another shot.\n\nthe restaurant looks ok, but nothing great.  it's very noisy, in keeping with the hard rock atmosphere.  the crowd is mostly young, but i think anyone would feel comfortable here; i did.  service is pleasant, although all the servers are running around at full speed.\n\nnow, on to the meal:\n\n    * i chose jyunmai daiginjyo sake.  it wasn't bad, but was a trifle harsh.\n    * small japanese spring roll with balsamic vinaigrette reduction.  good.\n    * trio of raw seafood: sea scallop slice, oyster, ama ebi (raw shrimp).  all served with onion and other spices, although each was slightly different.  good.\n    * seared maguro and a slightly strong flavored fish, <mark>Squid 'Pasta' with Light Garlic</mark> chips and a pickled ginger shoot.  a good combination.  very good.\n    * uni (<mark>Sea Urchin</mark>) <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> white fish, served on sliced eggplant.  the uni was seared and was surprisingly delicious.  there was also a tiny river crab, to be eaten shell and all; interesting for the crunch, not the flavor.  very good.\n    * o toro and a spring roll <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> sauce and radish.  the o toro was good but a little chewy, and the strong sauce tended to overwhelm the tuna.  good to very good.\n    * palate cleanser: intensely flavored, sweet/sour mango sorbet, on top of a red granite with little flavor.\n    * service lapse.  up to this point, courses had been timed well.  at this point, i waited for about 15 minutes, with no explanation.  this was a little annoying.\n    * grilled sea scallop on a bed of mushrooms, bits of seafood, and brown rice.  very good.\n    * <mark>Teppan Style Foie Gras</mark> and kobe beef.  a large hunk of <mark>Teppan Style Foie Gras</mark>; good flavor.  kobe beef very good.  overall, very good to excellent.\n    * service lapse: the next course was supposed to be sushi, followed by <mark><mark>Lobster <mark>Miso Soup</mark></mark></mark>.  they reversed the order, and apologized later.  a minor matter.\n    * <mark><mark>Lobster <mark>Miso Soup</mark></mark></mark>.  better than average; good fish stock flavor, not too salty.  very good.\n    * sushi: o-toro (tuna belly), <mark>Shima Aji</mark> (variety of mackerel?), some kind of crab, unagi (eel).  very good.\n    * fruit papillote.  like a crepe.  the raspberry seeds were very distracting.  fair.\n    * honey <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark>.  very strong honey flavor.  strange, but i liked it.  very good.\n\noverall, the meal was good, but not as good as nobu in miami, and not nearly as good as okada.  at the price they charge ($120), they need to do better.\n\n\nmeal #3: based on past meals, i hadn't planned to return. however, i found myself at the hard rock hotel at meal time, and no other choices looked appealing. i decided to go for unusual choices, hoping this would be a strength. this worked out better. my selections:\n\n    * ankimo (steamed monkfish liver). standard but still very good.\n    * <mark>Hamachi Kama</mark> (grilled yellowtail collar). this is a chunk of fish, skin and bone, served grilled. it may not sound like much, and it's a little difficult to get the flesh out, but it's usually very rich and very tasty. i was both happy and sad with my choice: it was very good, but not as good as elsewhere. if you'd like to try this dish, order it robatayaki style at okada.\n    * live shrimp. these santa barbara shrimp were killed in front of me, so i guess that means they're fresh. they were big and rather chewy; i'm guessing the latter is due to their recent demise. the heads were served tempura style, and were juicy and tasty.\n    * live octopus. i'm not sure that it was live, but slices of the tentacle, served raw, were indeed very fresh tasting - and much less chewy than the cooked version. pretty good.\n\nthis was the most satisfying of my meals at nobu. nothing was stellar, but everything was good.\n\n\n\nnobu's strength is its new take on japanese foods.  its weaknesses are sushi that isn't in the same class with the better places in las vegas, and suspect service.  given such high prices, i'd look elsewhere.", 
            "so we had reservations for 930 on a friday night and were seated immediately upon our arrival. the (almost all-male)staff were attentive, informative and friendly. \n\nour meal:\n\n-edamame with shaved seasalt\n-sashimi yellowtail <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark> <mark>Yellowtail and Jalapeno</mark> (yummmmy, bobby's favorite)\n-black cod in lettuce cups with filo flakes (my favorite, so perfect)\n-sashimi <mark>Squid 'Pasta' with Light Garlic</mark> chips (little too salty)\n-salmon sushi\n-toro sushi (very tasty fish)\n-dessert: edamame <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark> atop a brownsugar brownie,caramel sauce, and tiny sliver of decadent brittle...the <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark> scoop was so tiny that we really couldn't taste the edamame. \n\na super treat for sushi, but be prepared to spend money!!", 
            "bluf...the dining highlight of my trip to vegas with my girlfriend was our dinner at nobu.  this was my third trip to nobu, each time having had the chef's omakase tasting menu.  nobu's tasting menu is a thoughtfully composed meal served kaiseki-style (sort of a themed meal) that seeks to tie together individual dishes by attributes like taste, texture, and temperature to enhance the overall experience of the meal.  since there isn't a set menu, you select the price point you're willing to pay and the chef and the kitchen staff prepares an appropriate amount of courses using whatever exotic ingredients they deem fit.  we both received 9 courses with sake pairing. \n\nfirst course:  we started with a kumamoto oyster wrapped in <mark>Smoked Salmon</mark> topped with a osetra caviar, served on an endive leaf in an asparagus \"boat\" with accompanied by sweet <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> miso sauces.  a masterful start!  the 5 basic tastes were tastefully and elegantly captured together in a single dish! \n\nsecond course:  shima-aji sashimi served in a tosazu (vinegared sardines) gel\\u00e9e with micro celery and \"sea grapes\" kelp...garnished with pickled turnip.  a great all-around dish, but the pickle turnip was the ingredient that put it over the top!\n\nthird course:  bluefin tuna sashimi topped <mark>Squid 'Pasta' with Light Garlic</mark> pur\\u00e9e and sliced serrano chilies with jalape\\u00f1o emulsion over brown rice salsa.  i love sashimi, but the garlicky goodness and spiciness from the chilies was amazing.  the brown rice salsa was damn tasty in its own right!\n\nfourth course:  <mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> and seared sweet shrimp <mark><mark>Nobu's Moriawase Sashimi Salad</mark></mark> served with m\\u00e2che, peppercorn, <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Whole <mark>1/2 Maine Lobster</mark></mark> <mark>Roasted Poussin with Spicy Lemon</mark></mark> dressing.   another success!  the peppercorns gave it the spicy notes that greatly accented the raw fish.\n\nintermezzo:  a <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark>...a simple yet refreshing palate cleanser that marked the transition from cold dishes to hot.\n\nfifth course:  pan-seared seabass, seasonal mushrooms, and wild ramps served in a <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> sauce.  as much as i loved the seabass, the earthy mushrooms and ramps nearly stole the show in this dish!\n\nsixth course:  grilled wagyu beef with seared <mark>Teppan Style Foie Gras</mark> served over yellow sweet corn and snap peas <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark>-mirin reduction.  the oh-so-tender australian-raised wagyu beef paired nicely with the perfectly seared <mark>Teppan Style Foie Gras</mark>.  \n\nseventh course:  dashi <mark>Inaniwa Pasta with Lobster</mark> and enoki mushroom with japanese greens.  so simple, yet such an incredibly satisfying dish!  they didn't skimp on the lobster, either.  in many ways, this was my favorite dish of the night.\n\neighth course:  a selection of sushi...otoro (fatty tuna), tasmanian sea trout, <mark>Sea Eel</mark>, a fish i can't recall, mirugai (geoduck), and tamago (egg omelet).  i love sushi.  i loved all of these nigiri!\n\nninth course:  shiso (?) panna cotta with strawberry \"caviar\", an understated but very satisfying closer to our meal.  the \"caviar\" was made to resemble ikura or salmon roe and was a very nice, creative touch.\n\nas for our sake, chris (i think that was his name), our lead server, informed us that nobu imports its sake from japan and that it's made especially for nobu.  i'm not an expert, at all, on the finer aspects of sake.  suffice it to say, our pairings were very nice, with subtle, yet interesting differences between each glass and went well with each dish.  chris did a great job all-around job taking care of us.  we had a very leisurely meal, never feeling rushed, but we never had to wait for our next course or glass of sake.  the timing was impeccable!\n\ni'm really not the type of person to toss out superlatives casually, but our meal was arguably one of the best meals i've ever had...at least since i've started yelping!  each dish was memorable and no single dish clearly stood out as the best since they were all outstanding!  it takes a lot of hair-splitting to even pick a dish that was less satisfying that the rest but if i had to pick one, it was the wagyu and <mark>Teppan Style Foie Gras</mark> course...and that was only due to the impression that the accompaniments on other dishes were more exciting than the sweet corn and snap peas.  if you're in vegas for one night and can only eat at one place while you're there, go to nobu and have the omakase tasting menu!  you won't regret it!", 
            "nirvana - pure nirvana. my taste buds were happy, i was very happy. \n\nmy bf too me here (my first trip) for our saturday night dinner. we knew when we walked in that we were having the omakase. i truly cannot pick out one single dish that i liked over the others - every single one was executed perfectly. our waiter was kind enough to write down what we had so we could remember. though he didn't write down the sake pairings we had - every single one of them matched perfectly with the dish. my only sadness with the sake is that i can't buy it anywhere since it is made for nobu (perhaps time to sale it at the restaurant???) \n\ncourse 1: kumomoto oysters, wrapped in <mark>Smoked Salmon</mark> with osetra caviar, served with endive <mark>Tuna (Big Eye) and Asparagus</mark> in sweet and spicy miso sauces (sweet and spicy? oysters? what is not to love?) \n\ncourse 2: <mark>Shima Aji</mark> sashimi served in tosazu gelee with micro celery and sea grapes kelp; garnished with pickled turnip (i'm not normally a turnip fan, but you could serve this to me anytime!) \n\ncourse 3: bluefin tuna sashimi topped <mark>Squid 'Pasta' with Light Garlic</mark> puree and sliced jalapeno, served <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> emulsion over brown rice salsa (okay a truly unique dish - and it was spicy! you know i like spice in my life!) \n\ncourse 4: <mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> trout and seared sweet shrimp <mark><mark>Nobu's Moriawase Sashimi Salad</mark></mark> served with mache, peppercorn, <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Whole <mark>1/2 Maine Lobster</mark></mark> <mark>Roasted Poussin with Spicy Lemon</mark></mark> dressing. (this fish was so succulent, buttery and full of flavor - if only i could find this in dc) \n\ncourse 5: pan seared seagrass, seasonal mushrooms, wild ramps, served in <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> sauce \n\ncourse 6: grilled washu beef with eared <mark>Teppan Style Foie Gras</mark>, served over yellow sweet corn and snap peas <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark>-mirin reduction \n\ncourse 7: soup with huge chunks of lobster (yup - huge); loved the little enoki mushrooms in it! \n\ncourse 8: sushi: one standout for me - salt <mark>Fresh Water Eel</mark> with this leaf that kinda tasted like basil <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Whole <mark>1/2 Maine Lobster</mark></mark> <mark>Roasted Poussin with Spicy Lemon</mark></mark> together. wow - yummy (this from the girl who wouldn't eat eel for a long time). not that the other offerings weren't good. \n\ncourse 9: dessert. panna cotta (i think) with strawberry caviar - the caviar was awesome! \n\nfinal: three types of fruit sake. my favorite was the ginger. \n\ni have to say this was one of the highlights of our trip. thoroughly enjoyed the meal and would gladly go again and again.",

            "this is the 2nd time i've been to nobu las vegas, the first time was probably 8 years ago and i remember loving the food!  this time, i was underwhelmed and here are the reasons why:\n\n1. <mark>White Fish <mark>Scallop <mark>Salmon <mark>Oyster <mark>Beef <mark>Yuba Sashimi New Style</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark> sashimi isn't really new anymore, it's been around for a dang long time and to be honest, it's kinda played out.  s.b. and i both agreed that the plain sashimi was way better.  one suggestion would be to keep the sauces on the side rather than drowning the delicate fish...\n2. confusing menu - they had filet mignon in about 4 places on the menu, all with cryptic descriptions and different prices - once on the specials, twice on the hot items, and again on the last page.  i asked the waiter what was the difference between them all, and he wasn't able to articulate it.  we settled on the one with uni butter and peruvian potato salad ($50), it was char grilled and tender, but the cabernet sauce was way too sweet.\n3. the format made me think of a deconstructed combo plate, where you pick and choose off of the different menus, but in the end you basically had a combo plate - complete <mark>Chilean Sea Bass with Black Bean, Dry Miso, or Balsalmic Teriyaki</mark> chicken, salad, <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark>!\n\ndon't get me wrong, the food was still very good, but the experience just didn't have the same wow factor.  i guess back in the day, this was kinda revolutionary for a japanese restaurant.  it was high end, high quality, modern ambiance, and modern preparation, but 10 years later, after everyone and their mother has copied this format, it's just common.\n\nback to the drawing board nobu!", 
            "first time here and this was totally not what i was expecting i think i confused the name <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> noodle place i saw on television. i  thought it was a noodle place. and this is sushi. i am not a fan of seafood unless it's shrimp. \n\nwe walked up to the hostess stand and this polite young lady with long hair asked us  if we would like a table or to sit at the sushi bar. that is when i asked if this was just seafood. she said no there is beef and chicken. i was relieved. the decor is very japanese. bamboo on the wall, the ceiling had the wood <mark><mark>XO and Jamon Iberico</mark> <mark>Beef <mark>Crab Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> paper feel. which gave a dim light, made it hard on my eyes to read the menu.\n\n thank god for adrienne our server, because i know nothing about sushi and the menu had me lost. she was really nice and helped point out some good food! the chicken skewers <mark>Chilean Sea Bass with Black Bean, Dry Miso, or Balsalmic Teriyaki</mark> were ok. the beef skewers <mark>Chilean Sea Bass with Black Bean, Dry Miso, or Balsalmic Teriyaki</mark> were delicious, the meat was so tender and cooked perfectly. each order is $13. i ordered a side of white rice $3. the shrimp rolls were amazing crunchy warm goodness and i'm not a sushi person but this is really good. my boyfriend ordered the spicy shrimp and i got to try that it was good, had some veggies in it. \n\nthe servings here are tapas bar size. it's good food but expensive as heck."

            "it's vegas, it's glitsy, it's glam.  but the food here is suprisingly straightforward.    i was kind of expecting a lot of fancy appetizers, a bunch of cleverly named rolls, and fusiony kinda stuff, but the menu was actually pretty straight.  omakase is the way to go.\r\n\r\nthe quality of the sashimi here is top notch - very very fresh.  i heard that they cryogenically flash freeze the toro for freshness and it shows.  the cuts of toro here was excellent - marbelized and tender.\r\n\r\nthe jalapeno hamachi appetizer thing was really really good as well.  i'll have to start remembering these dish names, seriously.  but just look f<mark>Rock Shrimp Creamy Spicy, Butter Ponzu or Jalapeno</mark> on the menu, you can't miss it.\r\n\r\nmy big gripe witht his joint is that the prices are through the roof, and the portions are miniscule.  i suggest you hit another restaurant late night after dinner here (which we did).  actually this might be a good thing, because you can get in another meal!"

            "when nobu opened in new york city, it created a sensation.  reservations were nearly impossible to get, and its new interpretation of traditional japanese food was widely praised.  this led to the inevitable branding of the restaurant; nobu can be found all over the globe.\n\nmeal #1: i found las vegas nobu's sushi highly variable.  the overall quality was ok, but some items (e.g., uni) were poor while others (e.g., ankimo) were good.  orange and honey flavored sake was interesting but probably not worth repeating.\n\n\nmeal #2:  since my first meal, i went to nobu in miami beach, sat in the dining room and had the omakase meal.  i enjoyed that a bit more, so decided to give the vegas location another shot.\n\nthe restaurant looks ok, but nothing great.  it's very noisy, in keeping with the hard rock atmosphere.  the crowd is mostly young, but i think anyone would feel comfortable here; i did.  service is pleasant, although all the servers are running around at full speed.\n\nnow, on to the meal:\n\n    * i chose jyunmai daiginjyo sake.  it wasn't bad, but was a trifle harsh.\n    * small japanese spring roll with balsamic vinaigrette reduction.  good.\n    * trio of raw seafood: sea scallop slice, oyster, ama ebi (raw shrimp).  all served with onion and other spices, although each was slightly different.  good.\n    * seared maguro and a slightly strong flavored fish, <mark>Squid 'Pasta' with Light Garlic</mark> chips and a pickled ginger shoot.  a good combination.  very good.\n    * uni (<mark>Sea Urchin</mark>) <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> white fish, served on sliced eggplant.  the uni was seared and was surprisingly delicious.  there was also a tiny river crab, to be eaten shell and all; interesting for the crunch, not the flavor.  very good.\n    * o toro and a spring roll <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> sauce and radish.  the o toro was good but a little chewy, and the strong sauce tended to overwhelm the tuna.  good to very good.\n    * palate cleanser: intensely flavored, sweet/sour mango sorbet, on top of a red granite with little flavor.\n    * service lapse.  up to this point, courses had been timed well.  at this point, i waited for about 15 minutes, with no explanation.  this was a little annoying.\n    * grilled sea scallop on a bed of mushrooms, bits of seafood, and brown rice.  very good.\n    * <mark>Teppan Style Foie Gras</mark> and kobe beef.  a large hunk of <mark>Teppan Style Foie Gras</mark>; good flavor.  kobe beef very good.  overall, very good to excellent.\n    * service lapse: the next course was supposed to be sushi, followed by <mark><mark>Lobster <mark>Miso Soup</mark></mark></mark>.  they reversed the order, and apologized later.  a minor matter.\n    * <mark><mark>Lobster <mark>Miso Soup</mark></mark></mark>.  better than average; good fish stock flavor, not too salty.  very good.\n    * sushi: o-toro (tuna belly), <mark>Shima Aji</mark> (variety of mackerel?), some kind of crab, unagi (eel).  very good.\n    * fruit papillote.  like a crepe.  the raspberry seeds were very distracting.  fair.\n    * honey <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark>.  very strong honey flavor.  strange, but i liked it.  very good.\n\noverall, the meal was good, but not as good as nobu in miami, and not nearly as good as okada.  at the price they charge ($120), they need to do better.\n\n\nmeal #3: based on past meals, i hadn't planned to return. however, i found myself at the hard rock hotel at meal time, and no other choices looked appealing. i decided to go for unusual choices, hoping this would be a strength. this worked out better. my selections:\n\n    * ankimo (steamed monkfish liver). standard but still very good.\n    * <mark>Hamachi Kama</mark> (grilled yellowtail collar). this is a chunk of fish, skin and bone, served grilled. it may not sound like much, and it's a little difficult to get the flesh out, but it's usually very rich and very tasty. i was both happy and sad with my choice: it was very good, but not as good as elsewhere. if you'd like to try this dish, order it robatayaki style at okada.\n    * live shrimp. these santa barbara shrimp were killed in front of me, so i guess that means they're fresh. they were big and rather chewy; i'm guessing the latter is due to their recent demise. the heads were served tempura style, and were juicy and tasty.\n    * live octopus. i'm not sure that it was live, but slices of the tentacle, served raw, were indeed very fresh tasting - and much less chewy than the cooked version. pretty good.\n\nthis was the most satisfying of my meals at nobu. nothing was stellar, but everything was good.\n\n\n\nnobu's strength is its new take on japanese foods.  its weaknesses are sushi that isn't in the same class with the better places in las vegas, and suspect service.  given such high prices, i'd look elsewhere.",

            "i've heard various friends praise los angeles's nobu over the years, so after my girlfriend ran the las vegas marathon this weekend, we decided to celebrate <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> first-class sushi.\n\nwe had reservations at 9:00 pm, and we were seated promptly (actually ahead of time, which was nice). my first impression of the restaurant was that it was extremely loud (we were there on a tuesday night), and its location in the hard rock hotel made me groan (it's a bit out of the way, and not necessarily a place i want to poke around).\n\nour waiter, justin, was initially very prompt with our drink orders, but it took 10 minutes (and a reminder) to get glasses of water, and another 10 to get <mark><mark>Lobster <mark>Miso Soup</mark></mark></mark>.\n\nour first course was only half right (we got two dishes, but one was not what we ordered). the servers apologized and took it away. at the rate they were bringing out our food, though, we shuddered to think how long it would take them to bring out the correct dish. for<mark>Tuna (Big Eye)</mark>, it was corrected quickly.\n\nwhen our sushi came out, we noticed another mistake: the <mark>Spicy Miso Chips <mark>Nobu Crispy Rice with Big Eye Tuna</mark> or <mark>Scallop</mark></mark> had been mistakenly replaced with a second order of <mark>Spicy Tuna (Big Eye)</mark>. again, we told them it was wrong and again, they corrected the mistake rather quickly.\n\nservice got to be so bad that after asking a server to hail our waiter (and subsequently having the request ignored), we decided to get the manager over to our table. we were 30 seconds from getting up and leaving (she took another 5 minutes to get to the table) when she came over and heard our story. she seemed as interested in our plight as any manager should and agreed to comp some of our dishes, which was nice.\n\nstill, however, justin's service through the entire night was abysmal (i think we saw him 3 times over an hour and a half), and no amount of manager treatment could save the tip.\n\nregarding the food, it was ok. the <mark><mark>Lobster <mark>Miso Soup</mark></mark></mark> was great. the <mark>Spicy Tuna (Big Eye)</mark> and scallop rolls were anything but (very mild), and the hot/cold mixture of the tuna tempura rolls was a little strange. it was good, but the temperature difference was one of those things that made me wonder, \"is this supposed to be this way and i'm an idiot for thinking this, or is something actually wrong with how it was made?\" judging by the fact that the tuna tempura rolls were one of the dishes they got wrong initially, it could have been that they rushed the order and made it worse. either way, i wasn't really in love with it.\n\nfor the price i [would have] paid, i can't say that the las vegas nobu is really worth it for me again. i've had much better sushi in oakland, for much less.", 
            "we decided to try this place while in vegas as i knew the nobu in new york is the real deal. first of all, it was in a weird location inside the hard rock, hard to find at first. we were dressed up a bit for a nice dinner and were getting some stares as everyone in the lobby was super casual. we walked past the slot machines, drunk frat boy almost falling over us, and there, we finally found it. decor was quite dated and not so impressive for its name. we had wine and <mark>Sake Flight</mark> and way too much of it before food but the sashimi is the thing to get here. it's not raw, seared lightly <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> delicious sauce. sushi was very fresh as well. our waiter was very funny and knowledgeable. overall, even though it was quite expensive, it was doable according to the vegas standard and i would return here again so that i can say, \" can i have 10 plates of sashimi only please!\"",

            "totally disappointed at this place. i should've listened to my friend who went there and was really disappointed at their omakase, but noooo, i had to go and throw down two bills to prove to myself how much they sucked. \n\nthe decor was nothing to write home about. i think there was an overuse of bamboo in the place, the chairs were ikea and the tables were just weirdly laid out. \n\nfirst of all, i couldn't understand the cutesy english the waitress was speaking. each time she said something, we would pause for 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 seconds, since we couldn't tell if she was asking us a question or making a statement. then it'd be followed by, \"i'm sorry, what?\"\n\nwe ordered chilean sea bass in the black bean sauce, the <mark>King Crab Ceviche</mark>, <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> grilled beef thing. the ceviche was overwhelmingly tangy. i think it reshaped some of my fillings in my teeth. there was a lot of it though, even though the waitress told us that they were small portions. we next had the chilean sea bass which was not good at all. again, portion was decent, but it was bland and not even hot. finally, the meat came and although tender, it just wasn't as flavorful as i expected.\n\nfor being \"nobu,\" i did have high expectations. but dk and i evaluated it and said that even if this was a no-name restaurant that we just walked into, we still wouldn't have thought it was good. \n\nand by the next morning, we were telling people that it just \"sucked.\" and i'm sticking with that. \n\nso for those of you who speak mandarin, you know that \"bu\" means \"don't.\"  so this restaurant's name is a forewarning of a the answer you'll give when asked, \"so was it good?\" or \"is it worth going?\"\n\nno. bu.", 
            "i agree with ming-jou in the fact that i was totally disappointed at this place. i should have also listened to my friend who went there and was really disappointed at their omakase, but being japanese, i wanted to try their food to see what the hype was about.  we had reservations at 9 pm and although we got there earlier, they didn't seat us till then.  it was shockingly a loud place that we often had to yell at each other to talk and even to order.  also, the crowd was much older than i anticipated.  the interior had a nice asian feel to it with bamboos everywhere, even on the ceilings.\n\nfor starters, we had edamame, yellowtail tartar <mark>Yellowtail or Salmon <mark>Blue Fin <mark>Toro Tartare</mark> with Royal Ossetra Caviar</mark></mark>, <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark>.  the menu was vague that we didn't expect any sauce with the tartar, but to our surprise, it came in a sauce with wasabi that was a little spicy.  i wish the menu would have included more details.  we got to order individual tempura items, which was a \"first\" for me.  we ordered shrimp, broccoli, and sweet potato.  the order came with 2 pieces each.  i liked how it came out really hot with light batter.  also, they were generous with their tempura sauce with daikon-oroshi (grated daikon).  most places give you barely enough sauce.  for dinner, we shared the <mark>Sushi Dinner</mark> which came with 8 nigiri and 6 pieces of tekka maki (<mark>Big Eye Tuna Roll</mark>).  the sushi rice tasted old as it was cold and flat, not warm and plump.  also, the rice portion for a nigiri was much more than it needed.  fish seemed fresh, but the rice was disappointing.  that ruined my dinner.\n\nwe decided to try their dessert since we don't usually order dessert at an asian restaurant.  we tried their miso almond cake which was the best part of my meal.  it came <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> caramel glaze and edamame <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark>.  the cake was yummier than i expected.  \n\noverall, it was not as good as i expected but i'm giving 3 stars for the good dessert and the great service.", 
            "very very good. hard to say that it lived up to the hype, but i thought the omakase was good value for $100. i went with my parents and they also ordered the omakase. the waiter tempted us with the $150 omakase containing \"dishes not on the menu\", but being our first time at nobu, we went with the cheaper omakase. the dishes (as best as i can remember from my pics), in order: (cold-hot-sushi-soup-dessert)\n\n1) toro with spicy miso and caviar - wow, definitely one of the highlights of the omakase. super juicy, melt-in-your-mouth toro topped with a bit of caviar and sitting in a nice spicy miso sauce. omg so good. there was an interesting tiny japanese peach on the side to cleanse the palate.\n\n2) hawaiian <mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> sashimi - very nice texture and mix of flavors with the a citrus sauce, spot of spicy sauce, a sprinkle of black sea salt, and . not sure if it's on the regular menu, maybe it's called something else.\n\n3) kampachi and <mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> sashimi - super exotic and tasty. i didn't even know what kampachi was until i looked it up. apparently it's hawaiian yellowtail farmed in the open ocean off the kona coast of the big island. the trout was also very good. it looks a bit like salmon, but tastes a lot better. served with a nice miso-based sauce (i think) on the side, a couple small veggie sushi rolls, a roasted jalapeno, and a small, yellow, pear-shaped tomato sliced in half.\n\n4) black cod w/ miso - this dish really did live up to the hype. i was about to order it separately in case it did not come with the omakase, but our waiter said it is normally included in the $100 omakase since it's a very popular dish. omg so good. such delicate flavors and texture. amazing. i normally don't like to eat fish skin, but this skin is super good and flavorful. the cod is very light and flaky, but not dry. wow, this is a must try if you come to nobu.\n\n5) beef tenderloin w/ shiitake mushroom <mark>Tuna (Big Eye) and Asparagus</mark> - i didn't think this was that special and probably would not order off the regular menu. it was very good tenderloin though, cooked to a perfect medium rare, with a light sauce. it is served in a sizzling mini cast iron plate.\n\n6) nigiri sushi platter - delicious nigiri, super fresh, and most pieces i normally wouldn't order myself, but were interesting to try. tuna (best i've had in awhile), <mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark>, aji, giant clam, and sweet shrimp. mmm\n\n7) <mark><mark>Lobster <mark>Miso Soup</mark></mark></mark> w/ clams - pretty standard <mark><mark>Lobster <mark>Miso Soup</mark></mark></mark> with a few clams inside. the clams and miso is a good combination, but they can be tricky to fish out and eat with only chopsticks. i cheated on one of them and used two fingers to hold the shell. ;p\n\n8) flourless chocolate cake w/ green tea <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark> - a generous portion served in a cute <mark>Bento Box</mark>. nothing too spectacular or interesting, but delicious nonetheless. the cake was still nice and molten inside when it arrived. yum!\n\na pretty filling flight of dishes for $100. i thought it was good value to try many dishes, but i haven't seen the sizes of the normal dishes. many tables around us also ordered the omakase, as i heard the same descriptions being recited by the staff over and over. i over heard a table of french tourists behind us ordering california rolls, chicken teriyaki, tempura, and other generic stuff you can get anywhere. sigh, what a waste.\n\ni would recommend not to order anything not on the \"hot\" of \"cold\" specialty pages of the menu. the rest is basically traditional japanese fare you can get anywhere, but will probably taste better and cost a lot more at nobu. service was good, polite, and attentive. it was a bit odd when our waiter brought out the first few dishes, and then a couple other different guys brought out some of the following ones. weird.\n\nthe decor is basic, but nothing too special. the sushi bar looks cool and there's a pretty wall of bamboo poles at the back as you walk in. my parents like to eat early, so we moved our reservation to 6pm when they are supposed to open. when we arrived a few minutes early, the door was locked and they didn't seem ready yet. ten minutes later, they were ready. better to come early though, or your omakase may take two hours or longer to get through. ours took about 90 minutes because it wasn't that crowded until after 7.\n\ni think the tenderloin and dessert could have been better and more creative. otherwise, nearly flawless.\n\nif i ever return for a special occasion, i will definitely need to try the $150 omakase. with the economy in shambles, i kinda feel bad eating such an expensive dinner. for<mark>Tuna (Big Eye)</mark>, my parents picked up the tab tonight as i had paid last night at the painted pony. maybe in 2009 they will have a recession special, like gray's papaya. ;p", 
            "why you should go to nobu lv:\n\n1. cause everyone needs to go to nobu once in their life...why not vegas\n2. the calamari pasta is outta this world. a must have. but, don't let me set your expectations too high.\n3. overall experience is  warm, satisfying <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> exciting - hey, it's nobu.\n\nwhy you should not go to nobu lv:\n1. if you're going to nobu, you're either a foodie, looking for a trendy spot or from japan and need your rice (like the table next to us). well, while the food is pretty darn good, i heard the other spots - honolulu, nyc etc have a hipper vibe.\n2. you want to save money to eat during the rest of your trip. we gorged out and ended up spending at least $150 each. \n3. you want to stick on the strip. while the hard rock isn't very far, it'd be cool if nobu was in the midst of the chaos. on the other hand, maybe it's off-strip locale protects it...not sure on that one.\n\nin any case, try it. you won't regret it. at least you can say you been to nobu - like i basically am in this review.",

            "after being seated, our table was presented a single drink menu, and left alone for fifteen minutes. our waiter seemed a little miffed when he asked what we were going to start with to drink and i told him that we'd like to see food menus. i found it presumptuous and manipulative to leave us with a drink menu and that much free time. we are in vegas, i know, but when you're willing to pay for a nice meal, i expect a little more tact on behalf of the servers.\n\nour waiter was also very quick to tell us how he thought we should move through the menu, all the while, mispronouncing common japanese dishes.\n\nwe tried a number of different dishes and rolls from the blue fin toro to <mark>Spicy Miso Chips <mark>Nobu Crispy Rice with Big Eye Tuna</mark> or <mark>Scallop</mark></mark>, <mark>Fresh Water Eel</mark>, albacore, and <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark>. everything was... good. not impressive, certainly not memorable... just good.\n\nthe interior of this location was bland. one of my co-workers mentioned that the decoration on the walls looked like large ironing boards, which was a fair assessment. the main dining area was too bright for a comfortable dinner, and had us sitting around the kind of small, wood topped table you might find yourself at while having lunch at your favorite sandwich shop.\n\nthe banana cake <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> cream <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark> was a high note, although the spoonful <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark> that they tried to pass off as a scoop made me feel like i was caught in a scene from american psycho. \n\nfor all the noise i heard about nobu being something special, i left feeling uninspired, and with a reminder to myself why finding those one of a kind, family run japanese restaurants is such a treat.", 
            "i don't know if it was because of what we ordered, but i was not impressed. i eat a lot of sushi normally so i've had a lot of good sushi <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> bad sushi. nobu is a very well known restaurant but i didn't think it was that great. it was just good. it definitely was a bit pricey, but i understand it's vegas. however, even at normal prices, it still wouldn't have impressed. maybe next time i'll order other items. i will give it one more try.", 
            "ate at nobu in vegas last night and what an amazing experience we had.  we had the omakase experience, started with cold dishes to warm entree to heavy appetizer and finished off with a few of their special <mark>Dessert</mark>.  starters: <mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> sashimi with dried miso, olive oil and yuzu; <mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> and cilantro; <mark>Scallop</mark> and <mark>Black Cod Miso</mark> lettuce wraps; pink snapper with pineapple and tomatoes. for warm dishes: chilean sea bass <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> crust and <mark>Tenderloin of Beef</mark> braised <mark>Kumamoto Oyster with <mark>Bone in Ribeye 24oz Nobu Sauce</mark></mark> on a bed of south american yam; <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark> presented in 3 different sauces.  to finish off the meal, chelf sent a platter of 4 special <mark>Dessert</mark>.  always make room for dessert!!!", 
            "so i've been here a half dozen times in the past 6 months for birthdays and business dinners. for those that know how & what to order this is honestly the best japanese in las vegas. when i read the low star reviews it's obvious the ordering went awry, so i'm going to use this review as a class in what to get at nobu 101:\n\nfirst my dont's:\n*do not come here with a low budget in mind . you will pay over $100 pp  if you want a satisfying amazing meal. i've come in here and tried to do it \"cheap\" and walked away angry and disappointed. wait to dine here until you have the budget to do so properly. \n*do not order off the main menu . it's boring. the food isn't that great. steak is blah. tempura is blah. seriously avoid avoid avoid.\n*don't order sushi rolls.. this should go without saying!!! \n*don't blindly get the chef's omakase. you'll likely end up disappointed.\n*don't order the shit you get at your normal sushi place and compare it. order exotic cool things you can't get at home.\n\nnow for what to do!:\n*peruse the \"special\" menu and also talk to the waiter about other goodies they might have hiding in the back. literally all my great meals here have been 100% off the main menu. the off the menu items are by far the best\n*be open minded and try the interesting off the wall stuff. it will really blow you away. i've found the waiters to be really down to earth and cool here.. use them as a resource. tell them what you like/don't like and ask for recommendations ! \n\nlastly, i'll leave you with my favorites. most are off the menu. most are seasonal. yes, it's a grab bag what they'll have when you decide to dine here but honestly i've never been disappointed when ordering this way ! \n\ncold:\n*barracuda. omg. best sashimi i've had in my life. who knew!\n*tazmanian <mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark>. my next favorite. basically like a mild buttery salmon. \n*<mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> with pineapples\n*kampachi. i do prefer this prepared the yellow tail jalape\\u00f1o way instead of the yellow tail. once you've had wild yellow tail it's hard to order the normal one ever again ! \n\nhot:\n*<mark>Black Cod Miso</mark> cod lettuce wraps... with <mark>Teppan Style Foie Gras</mark>. insanely good.\n*the huge fried fish in that amazing buttery sauce. definitely not for the dieters or light eaters. get 1 of these if you have a huge group. it's big and heavy\n*quail stuffed with pork belly (as amazing as it sounds!)\n\ncliffsnotes: avoid ordering from the main menu. it's boring, uninspired and won't excite you. be brave and bold when ordering, don't come with a limited budget. enjoy!", 
            "i'll be honest. i came here for the dessert tasting platter. \n\ni saw the dessert list and died a little at the unique, creative and hitherto unknown creations being offered. so did my boyfriend. we decided we had to make it to nobu even if the apocalypse happened and giant flesh-eating gargoyles descended from the sky.\n\ni did not plan to have a full meal at all but wouldn't you know it, i did. ahhh, i love when upscale japanese restaurants live up to the hype.\n\nyellowtail with jalape\\u00f1o: tender slices of my fish soulmate in an amazing soy yuzu sauce with just a little kick. most perfect dish ever.\n\nbeef tenderloin tabu yaki: not quite as tender as kobe (is anything?) but delicious nonetheless.\n\n<mark>Spicy Scallop</mark> roll: fresh and tasty. the boyfriend was blown away by it, i thought it was good but otherwise unremarkable. i think raw scallop might be his yellowtail, though.\n\nblack cod <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark>: their signature dish. it's really hard to find fault with it. tender, melt-in-your-mouth fish in a sweet, light sauce. it should be heavy, but it's not. that's the miracle of japanese cooking.\n\n<mark>Spicy Seafood Soup</mark>: my favorite kind of food--soupy, spicy, seafoody. oh, and as an <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> bonus, loaded with more varieties of mushroom than a drug farmer. i have seen heaven and it's inside this bowl. get it!\n\nnow on to the nobu dessert platter:\n\n<mark>Bento Box</mark>: flourless chocolate cake with a white chocolate sauce, shiso syrup and green tea <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark>. like a japanese molten cake. did i mention that molten cake is like edible carnal sex? well, it is. so get this. just don't go all matrix reloaded in the restaurant.\n\ntrio of mochi: lessee, we got pumpkin spice, strawberry, <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> flavor not known to man, stuffed with ice-cream and accompanied by sour japanese mountain peaches. mmm...\n\nbananas in phyllo dough with tropical glaze: original creation not on the regular menu (haha!). it's crispy, fried bananas. need i say more?\n\nharom<mark>Aji (Jackfish)</mark> in cinnamon and sugar and center is sweet potato pur\\u00e9e: i totally didn't spell that right and since it's another original creation, i have no menu to look at. already tried googling and found nothing. anyway, this was incredible. i hate sweet potato and i thought this was da bomb. yeah, i'm channeling 2001 lingo.\n\neat here.", 
            "nobu i love you!!\n\ncame here on a vegas trip with one of the girls and this was our first stop! we dolled up, drove to the hard rock where there is valet parking, and walked into the center of the first floor where this ridiculously delicious restaurant is located.\n\nservice-great! everyone was really attentive. i always had my water filled, any finished dishes cleared off within the minute. the food came in really good timing as well. i was starving going in and i didn't have to wait. although coming from a restaurant like this i didn't expect anything less.\n\nthe decor is really comfy and not as fancy as i'd originally thought (or the other nobu restaurants apparently). you can definitely get away with begin pretty casual or dressing up your attire. while there were only small groups there they had some large tables <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> hidden rooms for even larger groups so if you need to bring a lot of people it seems as thought they'd be able to accommodate for more people.\n\nnow onto the best part of all! fooood is so worth the price!!\ndessert: lemme start with this one because i cannot get over the delicious trio of soy caramel, miso apple cinnamon donuts and a really delicious home made <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark> with toasted pecans. their pastry chef changes the dessert menu every season to go with what's in season which means i'm going to have to come here every season :)\n\napart from that we enjoyed the <mark>Black Cod Miso</mark>, eggplant miso (best i've ever had, decent portion but very rich), <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> (not spicy and very fresh!), <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark> (the garlic chips <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> great texture but the citrus oil sauce was too overpowering) and the shiitake <mark>Mushroom Salad</mark> (very strong citrus vinaigrette but delicious mushrooms to make up for it)\n\nawesome experience and a high price but definitely worth it :d", 
            "do you like big checks and hype...then this is the place for you. i have heard tons of great things about this restaurant but at the end of dinner i was really let down. \n\nthings i liked: \nrock <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark> with creamy spicy sauce \nmiso cod \nfresh <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> \n\nthings i didn't like: \nthe waitress was not very friendly. she informed us that our sushi dishes would come out last...guess what?  the sushi came out second...of course, we ate the sushi and our waitress came up to our table and asked if we wanted more food...she had no idea that we didn't even get our warm food. please dont  tell us our meal must end  with cold sushi and then the food runners can not even get it right. when you are paying this much for dinner, you expect to get treated <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> love. \n\nthe sushi rolls were extremely fishy too. my friends told me that it is the seaweed that they use...all i know is that i wanted to gag. \n\nalso we asked for two orders of the fresh <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> and they put both orders on one plate. that is fine but we received 11 pieces...so does that mean when you get one order you only get 5.5 pieces? the math does not <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark>. my friends told me that they noticed that they have been shorted before. wow and my friends still like this place...oh yeah expense account!!!\n\nsmall dishes with big prices!!!   if you are on an expense account then i recommend...go for it...run up the bill and try everything. if you are paying for it out of your pocket, then i would save my money for my kids college fund!!!", 
            "good food!  between 4 people, we were able to try a lot of stuff.  we started w/the live scallop, toro tartar w/caviar, and yellowtail sashimi w/jalapeno.  all were amazing.  then we had the <mark>Sashimi Dinner</mark> and a bunch of rolls.  dessert was something chocolatey w/crunchy bananas <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark>...can't recall the name (sake).  you can't go wrong w/this place!", 
            "my buddy and i went to nobu this past friday night at 9:30 for their omasake chef choice tasting menu. we had very few disappointments. they sat us right away at the bar, tables would have been 15 minutes even with our reservations.  lots of good energy in the restaurant, lots of japanese yelling back and forth from the waiters and sushi chefs.  we split a $50 bottle of nonfiltered very fragrant nigori sake cold which was smooth and easy to drink. the small bits of rice at the bottle of the bottle reminded me of red wine sediment as a good thing. \n\nthe first course came out quick and cold. a chilled patty of toro tartar in a soy wasabi sauce topped <mark>Yellowtail or Salmon <mark>Blue Fin <mark>Toro Tartare</mark> with Royal Ossetra Caviar</mark></mark>, served with a baby silver spoon.  it was tender, smooth, rich and melt in your mouth.  the caviar was not memorable.  an a+ start and an expensive dish on their regular menu. next was 4 pieces per plate of thin cut fresh octopus topped with a cilantro leaf, a dot of super hot sauce, finished with citrus, like ceviche.  pretty good.  next was another cold appetizer of rice paper wrapped greens with a piece of raw ebi sweet shrimp, dressed with a fantastic sesame ginger sauce with a fried prawn head on the side.  my buddy especially liked the tempura batter on the <mark>Sweet Shrimp with Fried Head</mark> and the dressing.  i will personally come to your house and kill you if you do not eat the fried prawn head. \n\nthen started the hot plates.  first was the ever famous <mark>Black Cod Miso</mark> cod, a bit too sweet for my buddy but it did not keep us from both licking the plates.  a small piece of tender fish which just went on and on and kept melting in our mouths.  flavor of fish hard to come through past miso and sweetness.  like fish candy in a good way.  my friend said that an improvement would be to torch and crisp up the skin before putting on the sauce which would give some texture contrast and make the dish over the top.  $23 on the regular menu.  next was the beef tenderloin toban yaki style with a shitake and enokitake mushrooms and a piece of thin asparagus in a soy broth. beef very lean, not as melt in your mouth as i would like.  my buddy would have liked a nice piece of ribeye cap instead but who wouldn't.  the dish is served spitting hot on a mini hot plate and when they raise the cover in front of you, the steam envelopes you warmly.  try not to get the grease on you. \n\nnext was the nigiri sushi course of 5 pieces along with a nice clam <mark><mark>Lobster <mark>Miso Soup</mark></mark></mark>. we got a piece of <mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> (mmmm), magura tuna (so tender), yellowtail (yum), clam (a bit tough) and <mark>Sea Eel</mark> which was the most tender fall apart <mark>Sea Eel</mark> i have ever tasted.  the sushi rice <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> fill you to the gills by that point and then they hit you with the dessert which was a bento presentation of a warm flowerless chocolate lava cake with lots of lava and very little cake and a very good not sweet green tea <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark>.   this just put the nail in the coffin.  we were stuffed, but we couldn't stop eating since it was so good.  \n\nthe restaurant closed at 11pm on a friday night, but we will remember the meal for a long time coming.  next time i'm in vegas i plan to make it a point to return and see what the chef choice is at that point in time.  this was the $100 omasake.  the $150 would have <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> some kobe beef and <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> and there.  we were very happy with our choice.  i think the meal was an absolute bargain for the price.", 
            "bluf...the dining highlight of my trip to vegas with my girlfriend was our dinner at nobu.  this was my third trip to nobu, each time having had the chef's omakase tasting menu.  nobu's tasting menu is a thoughtfully composed meal served kaiseki-style (sort of a themed meal) that seeks to tie together individual dishes by attributes like taste, texture, and temperature to enhance the overall experience of the meal.  since there isn't a set menu, you select the price point you're willing to pay and the chef and the kitchen staff prepares an appropriate amount of courses using whatever exotic ingredients they deem fit.  we both received 9 courses with sake pairing. \n\nfirst course:  we started with a kumamoto oyster wrapped in <mark>Smoked Salmon</mark> topped with a osetra caviar, served on an endive leaf in an asparagus \"boat\" with accompanied by sweet <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> miso sauces.  a masterful start!  the 5 basic tastes were tastefully and elegantly captured together in a single dish! \n\nsecond course:  shima-aji sashimi served in a tosazu (vinegared sardines) gel\\u00e9e with micro celery and \"sea grapes\" kelp...garnished with pickled turnip.  a great all-around dish, but the pickle turnip was the ingredient that put it over the top!\n\nthird course:  bluefin tuna sashimi topped <mark>Squid 'Pasta' with Light Garlic</mark> pur\\u00e9e and sliced serrano chilies with jalape\\u00f1o emulsion over brown rice salsa.  i love sashimi, but the garlicky goodness and spiciness from the chilies was amazing.  the brown rice salsa was damn tasty in its own right!\n\nfourth course:  <mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> and seared sweet shrimp <mark><mark>Nobu's Moriawase Sashimi Salad</mark></mark> served with m\\u00e2che, peppercorn, <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Whole <mark>1/2 Maine Lobster</mark></mark> <mark>Roasted Poussin with Spicy Lemon</mark></mark> dressing.   another success!  the peppercorns gave it the spicy notes that greatly accented the raw fish.\n\nintermezzo:  a <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark>...a simple yet refreshing palate cleanser that marked the transition from cold dishes to hot.\n\nfifth course:  pan-seared seabass, seasonal mushrooms, and wild ramps served in a <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> sauce.  as much as i loved the seabass, the earthy mushrooms and ramps nearly stole the show in this dish!\n\nsixth course:  grilled wagyu beef with seared <mark>Teppan Style Foie Gras</mark> served over yellow sweet corn and snap peas <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark>-mirin reduction.  the oh-so-tender australian-raised wagyu beef paired nicely with the perfectly seared <mark>Teppan Style Foie Gras</mark>.  \n\nseventh course:  dashi <mark>Inaniwa Pasta with Lobster</mark> and enoki mushroom with japanese greens.  so simple, yet such an incredibly satisfying dish!  they didn't skimp on the lobster, either.  in many ways, this was my favorite dish of the night.\n\neighth course:  a selection of sushi...otoro (fatty tuna), tasmanian sea trout, <mark>Sea Eel</mark>, a fish i can't recall, mirugai (geoduck), and tamago (egg omelet).  i love sushi.  i loved all of these nigiri!\n\nninth course:  shiso (?) panna cotta with strawberry \"caviar\", an understated but very satisfying closer to our meal.  the \"caviar\" was made to resemble ikura or salmon roe and was a very nice, creative touch.\n\nas for our sake, chris (i think that was his name), our lead server, informed us that nobu imports its sake from japan and that it's made especially for nobu.  i'm not an expert, at all, on the finer aspects of sake.  suffice it to say, our pairings were very nice, with subtle, yet interesting differences between each glass and went well with each dish.  chris did a great job all-around job taking care of us.  we had a very leisurely meal, never feeling rushed, but we never had to wait for our next course or glass of sake.  the timing was impeccable!\n\ni'm really not the type of person to toss out superlatives casually, but our meal was arguably one of the best meals i've ever had...at least since i've started yelping!  each dish was memorable and no single dish clearly stood out as the best since they were all outstanding!  it takes a lot of hair-splitting to even pick a dish that was less satisfying that the rest but if i had to pick one, it was the wagyu and <mark>Teppan Style Foie Gras</mark> course...and that was only due to the impression that the accompaniments on other dishes were more exciting than the sweet corn and snap peas.  if you're in vegas for one night and can only eat at one place while you're there, go to nobu and have the omakase tasting menu!  you won't regret it!", 
            "nirvana - pure nirvana. my taste buds were happy, i was very happy. \n\nmy bf too me here (my first trip) for our saturday night dinner. we knew when we walked in that we were having the omakase. i truly cannot pick out one single dish that i liked over the others - every single one was executed perfectly. our waiter was kind enough to write down what we had so we could remember. though he didn't write down the sake pairings we had - every single one of them matched perfectly with the dish. my only sadness with the sake is that i can't buy it anywhere since it is made for nobu (perhaps time to sale it at the restaurant???) \n\ncourse 1: kumomoto oysters, wrapped in <mark>Smoked Salmon</mark> with osetra caviar, served with endive <mark>Tuna (Big Eye) and Asparagus</mark> in sweet and spicy miso sauces (sweet and spicy? oysters? what is not to love?) \n\ncourse 2: <mark>Shima Aji</mark> sashimi served in tosazu gelee with micro celery and sea grapes kelp; garnished with pickled turnip (i'm not normally a turnip fan, but you could serve this to me anytime!) \n\ncourse 3: bluefin tuna sashimi topped <mark>Squid 'Pasta' with Light Garlic</mark> puree and sliced jalapeno, served <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> emulsion over brown rice salsa (okay a truly unique dish - and it was spicy! you know i like spice in my life!) \n\ncourse 4: <mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> trout and seared sweet shrimp <mark><mark>Nobu's Moriawase Sashimi Salad</mark></mark> served with mache, peppercorn, <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Whole <mark>1/2 Maine Lobster</mark></mark> <mark>Roasted Poussin with Spicy Lemon</mark></mark> dressing. (this fish was so succulent, buttery and full of flavor - if only i could find this in dc) \n\ncourse 5: pan seared seagrass, seasonal mushrooms, wild ramps, served in <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> sauce \n\ncourse 6: grilled washu beef with eared <mark>Teppan Style Foie Gras</mark>, served over yellow sweet corn and snap peas <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark>-mirin reduction \n\ncourse 7: soup with huge chunks of lobster (yup - huge); loved the little enoki mushrooms in it! \n\ncourse 8: sushi: one standout for me - salt <mark>Fresh Water Eel</mark> with this leaf that kinda tasted like basil <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Whole <mark>1/2 Maine Lobster</mark></mark> <mark>Roasted Poussin with Spicy Lemon</mark></mark> together. wow - yummy (this from the girl who wouldn't eat eel for a long time). not that the other offerings weren't good. \n\ncourse 9: dessert. panna cotta (i think) with strawberry caviar - the caviar was awesome! \n\nfinal: three types of fruit sake. my favorite was the ginger. \n\ni have to say this was one of the highlights of our trip. thoroughly enjoyed the meal and would gladly go again and again.",

            "let me preface this review by saying that i'm a huge self-admitted sushi <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> and my husband is peruvian, so nobu seemed a logical choice for our 7th anniversary dinner.  aside from the villainous penny slots  just outside the door, it was the perfect choice. \n\nwe started out with the <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark>.  yellowtail is by far my favorite raw fish and i've had a similar dish at several excellent bay area restaurants, but this was by far the most flavorful rendering of this dish that i've had. the sashimi was also not razor thin which was an awesome <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> bonus (honestly, i've gotten use to the fact that fine dining, particularly in vegas, means small portions and high prices so the amount of fish was a pleasant surprise. \n\nnext, we tried the tiradito nobu style <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> type of halibut like fish.  now, here the fish was razor thin, but came out with a dot of rocoto, a block of rock salt, the traditional lime juice and a side of cilantro.  my husband says this is exactly what tiradito is supposed to taste like, which makes me want to spend significantly more time in peru.  it was amazing.\n\nwe then moved on to the <mark>Black Cod Miso</mark> next and honestly, this was the only part of the meal that i was underwhelmed by.  i know that this is supposed to be the signature hot dish at nobu, but i've had a very similar dish at both morimoto napa and at hyakumi at cesar's palace and the texture of the fish wasn't the melt in your mouth awesomeness that i have come to expect from the dish. the flavor was right on, and if i'd never had black cod before, i would have loved it.  \n\nso, we moved back to the cold dishes and tried the <mark>White Fish <mark>Scallop <mark>Salmon <mark>Oyster <mark>Beef <mark>Yuba Sashimi New Style</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark> salmon sashimi (<mark>White Fish <mark>Scallop <mark>Salmon <mark>Oyster <mark>Beef <mark>Yuba Sashimi New Style</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark> because it's served with ginger, <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> other amazing deliciousnesss that i can't recall right now), finishing off the savory with the toro green onion maki (cut).  they were both amazing. \n\nwhat shocked me was how incredibly amazing the two <mark>Dessert</mark> we had were.  we tried the <mark>Bento Box</mark>, a flourless chocolate cake with house-made green tea <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark>, and this peach cobbler like dish with almond miso crumble and ginger <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark>.  i don't know if anyone else finds some green tea <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark> to sometimes taste vaguely like lipstick, but this <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark> was delicate and a beautiful companion to the rich chocolate cake.  the warm peaches with the crumble and (again not overpowering) ginger <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark> was a highlight of my whole trip to vegas.  (and i'm not really a dessert person)\n\nokay, this review is way too long, and i didn't even mention the impeccable service.  i can't wait to go back and wish there was a nobu in the bay area.", 
            "i read the reviews while waiting for the server to come and introduced himself to us.  placed in the hard rock hotel & casino, this place mixes the traditional japanese seafood restaurant <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> urban flair.  this place was pretty darn expensive, but i guess when it comes to fine dining, anything goes.  thankfully with my appetite, one entree was good enough with white rice. i had the sauteed eggplant, while my friends had other dishes <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> sake on the side. had an asahi beer too.\n\nthe ambiance was never quiet, but it fit the bill.  the tab came out to over $100, but i guess it works for them.  the service was spot on, and the server automatically poured our beers without asking into a cup.  thought that was pretty regal.  other than that, i wouldn't say it sucked.  but yet, it didn't give my seal of approval either.  granted that it was expensive, i could've used the money for other things, like gambling.", 
            "it's difficult to find a restaurant that can handle a large group party and still maintain the integrity of the food.    \n\nlocated in the notorious hard rock hotel just off the las vegas strip, nobu is solid place, especially for those convention group dinners.  one part rock n' roll, with the dancers on poles in the lobby, and all the rock memorabilia, one part zen with wooden japanese inspired interior, and one part subtle decadence with the most amazing japanese meal that i've had in long time.  \n\nhere's what we ordered: \n\nhamachi <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> and cilantro\nwashu beef\n<mark><mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> Salad</mark> <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Whole <mark>1/2 Maine Lobster</mark></mark> <mark>Roasted Poussin with Spicy Lemon</mark></mark> dressing\nrock <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark> - always a crowd pleaser \nblack cod <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark> wrapped in butter lettuce\nfresh <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> shaved black truffle - show stopper ending\nsake served in bamboo carafe and bamboo sake glasses\n\nwith all the nobu's chains are popping up all over the world, and everyone saying, \"this is my favorite restaurant\" all the time, i dismissed nobu for a while, but  after this meal, they are back on my radar.  \n\ntrendy, yet the food speaks for itself.  what a noteworthy and memorable meal.  i love that nobu uses delicate sauces, that compliment the food, instead of masking it with salt <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> that most fusion restaurants tend to do.  definitely an impressive meal for all our guests.  great for groups!", 
            "i was skeptical, but nobu delivered. i just finished dinner with a friend of mine and i had to write a review before i forgot the details. let's just get to the chase.\n\nmy friend and i walked in and i asked our server what the best three dishes were. he then recommend these three. i felt like a stuck up food critic requesting the chef hit me with his best shot. but i often do this for restaurants that i've never been to. after dinner, i find myself recommending the same. here's the pro and cons:\n\n1) toro carpaccio- okay, $70 for six pieces of fish can be a little on the steep side, but hey, i had to know what it was about. now i know and here's the scoop. the toro is incredibly delicious. it is amazingly tender, quite possibly the most tender toro i've ever had. the fish alone is a star, but the flavor profile that the chefs prepare is pretty impressive too. capers, truffle shavings, truffle oil <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> dressing over greens really hit the mark. i will say that there was a little too much soy sauce for my taste (that's right, i'm chinese and i'm saying it). i would request they served the sauce on the side, but fear they will substitute excess soy sauce with hate.\n\n2)<mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark>- this was almost my favorite dish of the night had it not been for the sheer flavor of the toro. the yellowtail is served as one would expect from an expensive sushi restaurant: fresh, flavorful, tender and seasoned according. the jalapeno slice was perfect- excellent spice without burning my mouth. i would actually recommend this as a first dish. \n\n3) <mark>Black Cod Miso</mark>- i thought this was a little overrated by the other reviews. cooked to near perfection, the cod was warm inside but seared and slightly crispy outside. the miso glaze wasn't much to look at. for me, it resembled gravy. i've seen others' pictures and theirs looks much nicer. nevertheless, the dish was great. i actually prefer black cod cooked slightly medium, but cooked to the core with awesome texture. sweet miso sauce finished off the dish and made it very enjoyable. \n\n4)<mark>Sea Urchin</mark> sashimi or sushi!!! just order it. \n\nmy friend and i were pretty hungry and ordered other dishes but i must say that they didn't exactly knock me off my feet. overall, many of the other dishes were very good, but just not amazing. here's the list:\n\n-<mark>Salmon Skin</mark> hand roll- thin slices of <mark>Salmon Skin</mark> with gobo, rice and seasoning. nice to have a place serve quality over quantity when it comes to the <mark>Salmon Skin</mark>.\n\n-baracuda <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark>- $40 for six slices of barracuda. very interesting texture as i haven't had barracuda before. the lemon/citrus sauce was a bit too much. again, i see this as how the chef intends the dish to be enjoyed, so i simply eat and keep my comments to myself. \n\nlive scallop- again, great cut of <mark>Scallop</mark>, but nothing special to write home about. it was nice that it was served with muscle in ponzu sauce. \n\n<mark>White Fish <mark>Scallop <mark>Salmon <mark>Oyster <mark>Beef <mark>Yuba Sashimi New Style</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark> oyster- four pieces of kumamoto oysters served ready to enjoy. so you have to eat it the way they prepare the seasoning.\n\ncrispy rice w/ <mark>Nobu Crispy Rice with Big Eye Tuna</mark>- for lack of a better term, it's japanese tatter tots. square rice cubes deep fried served with essentially tuna poke. well prepared, tasty, but nothing special. \n\nall in all, it was a great experience. my general assessment is that nobu serves dishes with strong flavor profiles. not exactly my cup of tea. maybe i'm a fond believer that less is more and that the fish should speak for itself. however, i can appreciate the fact that a chef's dish is his own art. so i eat with an open mind and share my interpretation. hope this helps.", 
            "nobu should <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> letters to the end of its name: e-n-o.  \n\nthe food here tastes better than mcdonald's but worse than chipotle, but i would rate mcdonald's higher due to it being a better value.  we had the tasting menu <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> sushi.  the <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark>, along with every other cold dish, followed the same formula: raw fish + cilantro hidden underneath a pile of salt. the black cod <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark> and the beef tenderloin tasted like bad halloween candy.  everything was either drenched in salt or drenched in sugar, or both.  the sushi was not inedible, it was on par with the kind of sushi you can get from any two-dollar-sign sushi restaurant.  it's pretty hard to mess up sushi to the extent that they messed up their other dishes, since chefs have less artistic license when it comes to sushi.  then again, it's hard to mess up <mark><mark>Lobster <mark>Miso Soup</mark></mark></mark> and theirs was the worst i've ever had (way too salty).  service was good.  \n\nour bill, including tip, came out to nearly $600 for three people.  so if you want to trick your non-asian friends into believing that their palates lack the sophistication to appreciate expensive asian cuisine, nobu is the place to go.  or sometimes when you're feeling masochistic, you just want to get punched in the face.  that's when you go to nobu.  \n\nthere are many reasons to go to nobu, but edible food is not among them.  if you want good food, there are some great french options in the area, such as le cirque.", 
            "i have been to nobu probably 5 times over the last 12 years,,, for business meetings and such,,,. even though i don't like it, no choice - but at least i don't have to pay...\n\nok, maybe the first time was fine. i didn't know much about japanese food back then. so, sashimi with jalape\\u00f1o/sesame oil, fish <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> sort of chinese sauce, and edamame were just fine. \n\nhowever, as i get to know more about japanese food, this place seems to be just so-so,,, especially for me,, i have spent a lot of time visiting japan lately and now i think i know what is good and what is bad. (all my japanese friends say nobu is fake and it is all about hollywood celeb and media who tries to hype this place up. i heard it is out of michelin rating in tokyo this year. and tokyo store is the best of all nobu,,, so, you know what this means).\n\ni mean, sashimi is ok. sushi is not that special - sumeshi (sushi rice ball) isn't that good. good sushi rice ball is a little sticky outside and super soft inside with mild, almost fruity vinegar flavor. good sushi never fall apart when you pick it up with chopsticks. it requires experience and technique. or maybe they use cheap rice from california.\n\nbut for sure, sushi chef here isn't there yet. maybe they aren't trained in japan. fake. \n\nanyway, this place is waaaaaaay overrated and overpriced. i give their food probably 3.5 stars,,, but the price!! waaay tooooo expensive!\n\nis it romantic? maybe yes for those who talk loud and keep spitting rice out of your mouth. not for me. this place is loud.\n\ni guess people go there to show off. have you talked to your friends how much $$$$ you spent at nobu? listen to your mind. i am sure you have. \n\nthis restaurant makes you feel you are celebrity - and this is pretty much it is all about.\n\nif you like to eat good sushi - get a cab and go to kabuto. if you like these rolls and wired sashimi, go to sen of japan to save a lot of money. if you like to eat sea bass with black bean sauce, go to chinese restaurants. \n\nthis ain't year of 2000 - we have lots more to choose in lv today. get real!",

(true story, i made the mistake of ordering a glass of wine at the bar in the casino at the flamingo (don't ask) one night and it had me wishing for manischewitz.)\n\nok - back to the matter at hand: nobu has now made me crave sashimi, sushi and all japanese food all the time. not only did the server rattle off, in detail, and totally and completely from her memory, just about every item listed on the menu, but the food was amazing. i die. we had a smattering of everything from each \"category\" and honestly, went a bit overboard, but it was a meal well worth going over board on. \n\nwe dined on:\n\n-edamame\n-<mark><mark>Lobster <mark>Miso Soup</mark></mark></mark>\n-tempura fried rock shrimp <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> type of delicious citrusy, creamy sauce\n-<mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> (out of this world)\n-red <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark> (also, amazing)\n-salmon <mark>White Fish <mark>Scallop <mark>Salmon <mark>Oyster <mark>Beef <mark>Yuba Sashimi New Style</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark> sashimi, which was lightly seared and served with green onion, absolutely delicious\n-<mark>Soft Shell Crab</mark> roll\n-spicy <mark>Big Eye Tuna Roll</mark> (cause, come on, you gotta round out the meal)\n\nthe dessert was good but unremarkable. i'm more about the main event.\n\ncap that <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> amazing gin cocktail that i now forget the name of and two glasses of hellaciously expensive, but delicious, sauvignon blanc, and this is one of the top meals i have had in my little life thus far... \n\nin short, take your gambling winnings to nobu and order everything the server suggests.",

            "impromptu trip to vegas for my best friend's birthday! yay! while planning our trip, i noticed a groupon for nobu. i'd been wanting to try out one of the la locations for a while, so this seemed like a win-win. overall, the experience was pretty great. the service was friendly and very attentive (almost too attentive... my ice tea cup was never empty. i don't think they even let it get half empty...)\n\nthe meal started with edamame which wasn't anything special. standard at any japanese place you'd go to. the first course was the yellowtail sashimi with jalepeno. this was so good!! i'm normally not a jalepeno fan, but it had just the right amount of kick to it. this was definitely my favorite dish of the night.\n\nnext up was the rock <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark>. this was alright. i liked the sauce with the lettuce/salad below, but it was too heavy for the shrimp... my friend and i agreed that it just left us craving honey walnut shrimp from panda express. \n\nthird entree up was the <mark>Black Cod Miso</mark>. this was also an outstanding dish, like the yellowtail. the fish was cooked perfectly and the entire dish was both presented well and tasted great. \n\nthe fourth entree (and the reason for docking one star) was california roll and assorted nigiri. maybe it's just because i live in la and i'm spoiled by great sushi, but i wasn't impressed. the fish was fresh enough, but definitely not up to par to say, sugarfish. and at the heart of it all, nobu is a japanese restaurant, so i expected their sushi to be on par with their fusion dishes. sadly, not the case.\n\nthe meal ended with the <mark>Bento Box</mark> dessert, which had flour-less chocolate cake, green tea <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark> <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> cappuccino thing. i'm not a huge dessert person but it was ok. i've never disliked any green tea <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark> i've had and the cappuccino thing was unique. \n\noverall, it was a great meal and good experience. without a doubt, it was worth the price of the groupon. not sure about full price though. i think only the yellowtail sashimi and <mark>Black Cod Miso</mark> would be worth it.", 
            "first time here and this was totally not what i was expecting i think i confused the name <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> noodle place i saw on television. i  thought it was a noodle place. and this is sushi. i am not a fan of seafood unless it's shrimp. \n\nwe walked up to the hostess stand and this polite young lady with long hair asked us  if we would like a table or to sit at the sushi bar. that is when i asked if this was just seafood. she said no there is beef and chicken. i was relieved. the decor is very japanese. bamboo on the wall, the ceiling had the wood <mark><mark>XO and Jamon Iberico</mark> <mark>Beef <mark>Crab Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> paper feel. which gave a dim light, made it hard on my eyes to read the menu.\n\n thank god for adrienne our server, because i know nothing about sushi and the menu had me lost. she was really nice and helped point out some good food! the chicken skewers <mark>Chilean Sea Bass with Black Bean, Dry Miso, or Balsalmic Teriyaki</mark> were ok. the beef skewers <mark>Chilean Sea Bass with Black Bean, Dry Miso, or Balsalmic Teriyaki</mark> were delicious, the meat was so tender and cooked perfectly. each order is $13. i ordered a side of white rice $3. the shrimp rolls were amazing crunchy warm goodness and i'm not a sushi person but this is really good. my boyfriend ordered the spicy shrimp and i got to try that it was good, had some veggies in it. \n\nthe servings here are tapas bar size. it's good food but expensive as heck.", 
            "there's a groupon for nobu?!! whaaaat!?! yes, believe it! i had purchased a groupon for a 5 course tasting menu for $80 for 2 people. and my bf was super excited because he has been wanting to try this place for a while now. it was actually perfect timing that this groupon became available because i was going to be in vegas this weekend. *woot woot!* anyways, i made reservations for 2 at 6pm online and got an e-mail confirmation right away. the groupon can only be used at the nobu inside the hard rock hotel. there's also a nobu inside caeser's palace. once we checked in with the hostesses, we were immediately seated at a nice comfy table and were greeted with a big welcome in japanese! the decor inside was really nice and elegant. i really liked the bamboo wall they had. i also thought it was really cute that we each had a rock on our table used as a chopstick holder. \n\nok onto the food! so we started off <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> edamame with sea salt, which was nothing too special but was good. next came the best sashimi i had ever had in my life! its yellowtail sashimi with a jalapeno slice on top dressed in almost like a ponzu sauce. the flavors went really well together and the yellowtail was fresh and spicy. yumm!!! i can probably eat like five more of that dish. :p the next dish was also another one of their popular dishes: the <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark>. i was really surprised that the shrimp didn't look at all like the usual tempura found at japanese restaurants. the dish almost looked like honey walnut shrimp actually but tasted ten times better. it was rich and creamy. and the sauce it was covered in was deliscious. next came their black cod dish. my bf absolutely loved this one and i can see why. it was so flakey and cooked to perfection. the fish melted in our mouths like butter and it was sweet and savory. next came a plate of sushi, which consisted of a califonia roll and 6 pieces of sashimi sushi. this dish was nothing too fancy and didn't stand out too much. but it was still tasty. and lastly we got our dessert! it was such a cute looking dessert, which composed of a green tea ice-cream, a flourless chocolate cake, and a cuppacino cup. omg...so good!!! the green tea ice-cream is made in house and  after one bite and you definetely know it's green tea ice-cream. the cuppacino cup was probably my favorite out of the other 2 <mark>Dessert</mark> because it was so beautifully crafted and tasted heavenly. the chocolate cake was very fluffy and not too sweet. overall, everything we tried was excellent! the reason why i subtracted 1 star was because both my bf and i felt that the cod and the shrimp was slightly on the saltier side and all of the dishes are pretty small plates to share between 2 people. otherwise, customer service here was superb and our server was just so friendly and informative on the dishes we were trying. i'm so happy to get to try nobu for the first time! =) so go get your groupon, while it's still available peeps!!", 
            "<mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> is a must try! delicious! we enjoyed everything we had on the tasting menu, but we <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> the <mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark>, at the suggestion of our server, and we were not disappointed. the service is impeccable, and the ambiance is nice. bijan was our server and he was an absolute delight!"

            "when nobu opened in new york city, it created a sensation.  reservations were nearly impossible to get, and its new interpretation of traditional japanese food was widely praised.  this led to the inevitable branding of the restaurant; nobu can be found all over the globe.\n\nmeal #1: i found las vegas nobu's sushi highly variable.  the overall quality was ok, but some items (e.g., uni) were poor while others (e.g., ankimo) were good.  orange and honey flavored sake was interesting but probably not worth repeating.\n\n\nmeal #2:  since my first meal, i went to nobu in miami beach, sat in the dining room and had the omakase meal.  i enjoyed that a bit more, so decided to give the vegas location another shot.\n\nthe restaurant looks ok, but nothing great.  it's very noisy, in keeping with the hard rock atmosphere.  the crowd is mostly young, but i think anyone would feel comfortable here; i did.  service is pleasant, although all the servers are running around at full speed.\n\nnow, on to the meal:\n\n    * i chose jyunmai daiginjyo sake.  it wasn't bad, but was a trifle harsh.\n    * small japanese spring roll with balsamic vinaigrette reduction.  good.\n    * trio of raw seafood: sea scallop slice, oyster, ama ebi (raw shrimp).  all served with onion and other spices, although each was slightly different.  good.\n    * seared maguro and a slightly strong flavored fish, <mark>Squid 'Pasta' with Light Garlic</mark> chips and a pickled ginger shoot.  a good combination.  very good.\n    * uni (<mark>Sea Urchin</mark>) <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> white fish, served on sliced eggplant.  the uni was seared and was surprisingly delicious.  there was also a tiny river crab, to be eaten shell and all; interesting for the crunch, not the flavor.  very good.\n    * o toro and a spring roll <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> sauce and radish.  the o toro was good but a little chewy, and the strong sauce tended to overwhelm the tuna.  good to very good.\n    * palate cleanser: intensely flavored, sweet/sour mango sorbet, on top of a red granite with little flavor.\n    * service lapse.  up to this point, courses had been timed well.  at this point, i waited for about 15 minutes, with no explanation.  this was a little annoying.\n    * grilled sea scallop on a bed of mushrooms, bits of seafood, and brown rice.  very good.\n    * <mark>Teppan Style Foie Gras</mark> and kobe beef.  a large hunk of <mark>Teppan Style Foie Gras</mark>; good flavor.  kobe beef very good.  overall, very good to excellent.\n    * service lapse: the next course was supposed to be sushi, followed by <mark><mark>Lobster <mark>Miso Soup</mark></mark></mark>.  they reversed the order, and apologized later.  a minor matter.\n    * <mark><mark>Lobster <mark>Miso Soup</mark></mark></mark>.  better than average; good fish stock flavor, not too salty.  very good.\n    * sushi: o-toro (tuna belly), <mark>Shima Aji</mark> (variety of mackerel?), some kind of crab, unagi (eel).  very good.\n    * fruit papillote.  like a crepe.  the raspberry seeds were very distracting.  fair.\n    * honey <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark>.  very strong honey flavor.  strange, but i liked it.  very good.\n\noverall, the meal was good, but not as good as nobu in miami, and not nearly as good as okada.  at the price they charge ($120), they need to do better.\n\n\nmeal #3: based on past meals, i hadn't planned to return. however, i found myself at the hard rock hotel at meal time, and no other choices looked appealing. i decided to go for unusual choices, hoping this would be a strength. this worked out better. my selections:\n\n    * ankimo (steamed monkfish liver). standard but still very good.\n    * <mark>Hamachi Kama</mark> (grilled yellowtail collar). this is a chunk of fish, skin and bone, served grilled. it may not sound like much, and it's a little difficult to get the flesh out, but it's usually very rich and very tasty. i was both happy and sad with my choice: it was very good, but not as good as elsewhere. if you'd like to try this dish, order it robatayaki style at okada.\n    * live shrimp. these santa barbara shrimp were killed in front of me, so i guess that means they're fresh. they were big and rather chewy; i'm guessing the latter is due to their recent demise. the heads were served tempura style, and were juicy and tasty.\n    * live octopus. i'm not sure that it was live, but slices of the tentacle, served raw, were indeed very fresh tasting - and much less chewy than the cooked version. pretty good.\n\nthis was the most satisfying of my meals at nobu. nothing was stellar, but everything was good.\n\n\n\nnobu's strength is its new take on japanese foods.  its weaknesses are sushi that isn't in the same class with the better places in las vegas, and suspect service.  given such high prices, i'd look elsewhere.", 
            "i'm not going to lie--a small part of me dies every time i think about how much we spent here.  but the truth of the matter is, you can't get good sushi without paying for it.  \n\nwe ordered the $100 omakase, the uni tempura set, kabocha tempura, and salmon sashimi.\n\nthe fusion dishes (like the hamachi <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> or the snapper with cucumber <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Whole <mark>1/2 Maine Lobster</mark></mark> <mark>Roasted Poussin with Spicy Lemon</mark></mark> juice) were fun to try but i find that the sauces often overpower the fish, which is the best thing about nobu.  if you have never tried any of their signature dishes, you might want to order at least one of the omakase options, but if you're just looking to enjoy the fish qua fish, then order the sashimi and/or nigiri a la carte.\n\nand yes, let's talk about the fish.  i have never had such a wonderfully buttery miso black cod!  and the toro, maguro, aji, trout, and sake (as in salmon sashimi) simply melted in our mouths.  no biting necessary.  the only low point was that the anago in our complimentary sushi was littered with small fish bones but hey, it was complimentary!  yet another reason why i love nobu.  they know how to treat the ladies right.\n\nas for the tempura, the kabocha was out of season, so it was our bad for ordering it in the first place, but the uni tempura was unlike anything i have ever had.  every bite was bursting with succulence and the tempura batter <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> extra texture and flavor.  heavenly.  anyone who is a fan of uni and/or tempura needs to try this!  it also comes with tempura shiitake mushroom (luxuriously juicy), tempura shiso leaf (so crispy, so light), and one other <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark> that i forget but that my mom thought was delicious.\n\nthe dessert was lovely too--we had the <mark>Bento Box</mark> which consists of flourless chocolate cake and homemade green tea <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark>.  not too sweet and the perfect way to end a perfect meal.\n\ni seriously cannot wait to come back here again and try the <mark>Hamachi Kama</mark>, the snapper, the whole fried fish, and the squid salad.  is it expensive?  yes.  but is it worth it?  most definitely.", 
            "yikes, what happened?\n\nconsistency isn't one of nobu's strengths, apparently, which i believe should be a priority if they are going to charge their customers as much as they do.  i ordered the cheaper $100 omakase again (which i do believe is a good deal given the amount of food you get) but the quality of fish has gone downhill since my last visit.\n\nthe signature hamachi <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark>?  devoid of all velvety tenderness.  the salmon sashimi?  like chewing a rug.  the maguro nigiri?  stringy and tough.\n\non top of it all, i ventured out and tried the <mark>Hamachi Kama</mark>.  not bad, but terrible for $20.  in san diego, you can get the same size <mark>Hamachi Kama</mark> with every bite just as, if not more, succulent for $9.  there is no excuse, honestly.  if you are going to charge me $20, you better make sure not a single sliver of white meat is dry.  half the fish was, but luckily there was dipping sauce to keep the meat from being unbearable to the palate.\n\nnobu isn't a complete loss, though.  like i stated before, the omakase is a great deal, price wise.  it comes with the famed bento dessert, which was even better than i remembered it being last time.  we also tried the miso almond cake and edamame <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark>, which was great in that it was unique and creative (the taste, quite honestly, was *salty*), but it all paled in comparison with the flourless chocolate cake crowned in green tea <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark> that is the bento.  never be tempted to order a different dessert here at nobu.  ever.\n\nsame goes with the black cod.  yes, it's small and yes, it's expensive if you order it a la carte, but it's worth every luscious bite.  it should be a must-order if you come here (it comes with the omakase, but it's so good, you should probably just order another).\n\none item not part of the omakase menu is the uni tempura set.  perhaps the deep frying hides any flaws in the uni, but i could taste that warm sweet flavor that i know is associated with high quality freshness.  gotta love the juicy mushroom and refreshing shiso that comes with it too.  the set is also accompanied with a set of delightful salts, all used to enhance in my opinion, what needs no enhancement.  still nice to look at, though, and they make for some good pictures!\n\ni also tried one of the eponymous sakes and was impressed.  can't remember which one, but the price was reasonable.  wonderfully smooth and paired well with the fish.  i highly recommend that you get it served hot.\n\nwhile i maintain an a-ok for nobu, i doubt i'll be coming back.  there are other places to get better japanese food--and for better prices.", 
            "everything was way overpriced and overrated!\n\ni ordered two orders of uni sushi and it costed me $40! not to mention they weren't too fresh neither. also tried their <mark>Hamachi Kama</mark> and it was under cooked, nasty! the special white fish sashimi was probably the best, but too much oil and sauce.\n\nwaiter service was good, nice and quick so two stars go here.\n\nthe way they manage takeout order was kind of strange; i can't order from front desk even they had like 3 people doing nothing (just chatting with each others). i had to go over to the bar area and ordered from the bar tender - odd.\n\nanyway, not coming back."

            "bluf...the dining highlight of my trip to vegas with my girlfriend was our dinner at nobu.  this was my third trip to nobu, each time having had the chef's omakase tasting menu.  nobu's tasting menu is a thoughtfully composed meal served kaiseki-style (sort of a themed meal) that seeks to tie together individual dishes by attributes like taste, texture, and temperature to enhance the overall experience of the meal.  since there isn't a set menu, you select the price point you're willing to pay and the chef and the kitchen staff prepares an appropriate amount of courses using whatever exotic ingredients they deem fit.  we both received 9 courses with sake pairing. \n\nfirst course:  we started with a kumamoto oyster wrapped in <mark>Smoked Salmon</mark> topped with a osetra caviar, served on an endive leaf in an asparagus \"boat\" with accompanied by sweet <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> miso sauces.  a masterful start!  the 5 basic tastes were tastefully and elegantly captured together in a single dish! \n\nsecond course:  shima-aji sashimi served in a tosazu (vinegared sardines) gel\\u00e9e with micro celery and \"sea grapes\" kelp...garnished with pickled turnip.  a great all-around dish, but the pickle turnip was the ingredient that put it over the top!\n\nthird course:  bluefin tuna sashimi topped <mark>Squid 'Pasta' with Light Garlic</mark> pur\\u00e9e and sliced serrano chilies with jalape\\u00f1o emulsion over brown rice salsa.  i love sashimi, but the garlicky goodness and spiciness from the chilies was amazing.  the brown rice salsa was damn tasty in its own right!\n\nfourth course:  <mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> and seared sweet shrimp <mark><mark>Nobu's Moriawase Sashimi Salad</mark></mark> served with m\\u00e2che, peppercorn, <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Whole <mark>1/2 Maine Lobster</mark></mark> <mark>Roasted Poussin with Spicy Lemon</mark></mark> dressing.   another success!  the peppercorns gave it the spicy notes that greatly accented the raw fish.\n\nintermezzo:  a <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark>...a simple yet refreshing palate cleanser that marked the transition from cold dishes to hot.\n\nfifth course:  pan-seared seabass, seasonal mushrooms, and wild ramps served in a <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> sauce.  as much as i loved the seabass, the earthy mushrooms and ramps nearly stole the show in this dish!\n\nsixth course:  grilled wagyu beef with seared <mark>Teppan Style Foie Gras</mark> served over yellow sweet corn and snap peas <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark>-mirin reduction.  the oh-so-tender australian-raised wagyu beef paired nicely with the perfectly seared <mark>Teppan Style Foie Gras</mark>.  \n\nseventh course:  dashi <mark>Inaniwa Pasta with Lobster</mark> and enoki mushroom with japanese greens.  so simple, yet such an incredibly satisfying dish!  they didn't skimp on the lobster, either.  in many ways, this was my favorite dish of the night.\n\neighth course:  a selection of sushi...otoro (fatty tuna), tasmanian sea trout, <mark>Sea Eel</mark>, a fish i can't recall, mirugai (geoduck), and tamago (egg omelet).  i love sushi.  i loved all of these nigiri!\n\nninth course:  shiso (?) panna cotta with strawberry \"caviar\", an understated but very satisfying closer to our meal.  the \"caviar\" was made to resemble ikura or salmon roe and was a very nice, creative touch.\n\nas for our sake, chris (i think that was his name), our lead server, informed us that nobu imports its sake from japan and that it's made especially for nobu.  i'm not an expert, at all, on the finer aspects of sake.  suffice it to say, our pairings were very nice, with subtle, yet interesting differences between each glass and went well with each dish.  chris did a great job all-around job taking care of us.  we had a very leisurely meal, never feeling rushed, but we never had to wait for our next course or glass of sake.  the timing was impeccable!\n\ni'm really not the type of person to toss out superlatives casually, but our meal was arguably one of the best meals i've ever had...at least since i've started yelping!  each dish was memorable and no single dish clearly stood out as the best since they were all outstanding!  it takes a lot of hair-splitting to even pick a dish that was less satisfying that the rest but if i had to pick one, it was the wagyu and <mark>Teppan Style Foie Gras</mark> course...and that was only due to the impression that the accompaniments on other dishes were more exciting than the sweet corn and snap peas.  if you're in vegas for one night and can only eat at one place while you're there, go to nobu and have the omakase tasting menu!  you won't regret it!",

(this fish was so succulent, buttery and full of flavor - if only i could find this in dc) \n\ncourse 5: pan seared seagrass, seasonal mushrooms, wild ramps, served in <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> sauce \n\ncourse 6: grilled washu beef with eared <mark>Teppan Style Foie Gras</mark>, served over yellow sweet corn and snap peas <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark>-mirin reduction \n\ncourse 7: soup with huge chunks of lobster (yup - huge); loved the little enoki mushrooms in it! \n\ncourse 8: sushi: one standout for me - salt <mark>Fresh Water Eel</mark> with this leaf that kinda tasted like basil <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Whole <mark>1/2 Maine Lobster</mark></mark> <mark>Roasted Poussin with Spicy Lemon</mark></mark> together. wow - yummy (this from the girl who wouldn't eat eel for a long time). not that the other offerings weren't good. \n\ncourse 9: dessert. panna cotta (i think) with strawberry caviar - the caviar was awesome! \n\nfinal: three types of fruit sake. my favorite was the ginger. \n\ni have to say this was one of the highlights of our trip. thoroughly enjoyed the meal and would gladly go again and again.", 
            "it's difficult to find a restaurant that can handle a large group party and still maintain the integrity of the food.    \n\nlocated in the notorious hard rock hotel just off the las vegas strip, nobu is solid place, especially for those convention group dinners.  one part rock n' roll, with the dancers on poles in the lobby, and all the rock memorabilia, one part zen with wooden japanese inspired interior, and one part subtle decadence with the most amazing japanese meal that i've had in long time.  \n\nhere's what we ordered: \n\nhamachi <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> and cilantro\nwashu beef\n<mark><mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> Salad</mark> <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Whole <mark>1/2 Maine Lobster</mark></mark> <mark>Roasted Poussin with Spicy Lemon</mark></mark> dressing\nrock <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark> - always a crowd pleaser \nblack cod <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark> wrapped in butter lettuce\nfresh <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> shaved black truffle - show stopper ending\nsake served in bamboo carafe and bamboo sake glasses\n\nwith all the nobu's chains are popping up all over the world, and everyone saying, \"this is my favorite restaurant\" all the time, i dismissed nobu for a while, but  after this meal, they are back on my radar.  \n\ntrendy, yet the food speaks for itself.  what a noteworthy and memorable meal.  i love that nobu uses delicate sauces, that compliment the food, instead of masking it with salt <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> that most fusion restaurants tend to do.  definitely an impressive meal for all our guests.  great for groups!"

            "having owned nobu's cookbook for years, i was only too excited to finally visit a restaurant of his.  (which means my lazy ass never made anything form the cookbook but my excuse is that some of his ingredients are so hard to find....but i digress).\n\ndrinks:\njyunmai sake - \"masu\" size (wooden box cup) smooth and lovely to drink\nyk 35 - \"masu\" size.  this was the most expensive one on their list and boy was it worth every dollar.\nnote: masu is served in an overflowing box-cup on a plate.  you finish your cup and then pour what's on the plate back into your vessel.\n\nfood:\nmonkfish liver - honestly, not my thing.  i tried but just couldn't get over the fish-flavored paste.  it had caviar on top which i ate.  but my husband who loved it said the sweet miso sauce enhanced the whole thing greatly.  he enjoyed having the dish to himself.\ntiradito, nobu style - sashimi with a dab of hot chili sauce and black sea salt and cilantro.  one of my faves but not for hubby\n<mark>White Fish <mark>Scallop <mark>Salmon <mark>Oyster <mark>Beef <mark>Yuba Sashimi New Style</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark> sashimi - sashimi doused <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> sauce and oil, topped with ginger and green onions. also one of my faves but had to share this one with hubby. \nsweet shrimp <mark>White Fish <mark>Scallop <mark>Salmon <mark>Oyster <mark>Beef <mark>Yuba Sashimi New Style</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark> sashimi - even better than the above.  yum.  hubby let me have most of this one and for that, i'm forever grateful.\nuni tempura - this was the one thing i wanted to try the most.  the shiso wrapped around the uni gave it another facet and i greatly enjoyed this dish...on my own.  more for me!  the accompanying shitake mushroom and salts were delicious.\nmiso black cod - i didn't have high hopes but our server recommended it so we went with it.  i was pleasantly surprised.  the serving size was reasonable.  four 2-bite pieces served on butter lettuce and topped with crispy noodle things.  very enjoyable.\n<mark>Scallop</mark> <mark><mark>Whole <mark>1/2 Maine Lobster</mark></mark> with Wasabi Pepper</mark> sauce - again, a pretty good-sized serving. the sauce was phenomenal although i do wish there was more of a wasabi kick.  i'm no wuss about spiciness but the pepper in this kept choking me up.  \n\ndessert:\ncaramel chocolate mouse - i thought this sounded rather ordinary until i looked at the ingredient list.  globe of chocolate filled halfway with mousse (very light and delicate), topped with a toffee disc, topped <mark>Squid with Shiso</mark> citrus granite, topped with caramel \"caviar\"; everything sat on top of a thick coconut sauce, dusting of brown powder sugar and crispy japanese rice.  best dish we had all night.  loved it.  i could have had 3 more.\n\nservice was great with several lapses here and there.  the busboys were impeccable.  our server got less and less attentive with the arrival of his other tables.\n\nthe quality of the food was excellent and did not disappoint.  i'm no stranger to paying several bills for dinner but for whatever reason, i did feel that food was somewhat overpriced here.  or maybe for what we paid, i thought the food should have been 5-star."

            "my husband and i had dinner here last night.  we had dinner at nobu in nyc years ago and loved it then.  this dinner did not disappoint.  \n\nwe shared the tempura rock shrimp and <mark>Black Cod Miso</mark> cod.  both delicious and i could have easily just have ordered another one of either versus trying something different.  but i had a <mark>Spicy Tuna (Big Eye)</mark> handroll - also very good.  my husband ordered the yellowtail collar - i was not a fan of this as it smelled very fishy but he liked it a lot.  also the edamame was warm with sea salt - never had it this way - very good.  but i am a salt-o-holic :-)\n\nthe service was very good.  our waiter came back enough to check on us without it being intrusive.   i had the champagne 95 cocktail - yum.\n\nit was a sunday night at 9:30pm (and closer to 11pm when we left) and it was crowded so imagine friday and saturday nights get pretty crazy and since its vegas there are a lot of late diners.  definitely recommend a reservation.", 
            "let me start by saying the food here is exceptional!  we had most of the restaurant's favorites and recommendations.  some stand out dish were the <mark>Black Cod Miso</mark> which was heavenly and my favorite was the toro sashimi - to die for!!!  the service was good.  but the vibe at the restaurant was a little strange.  felt a little bit too night club like, especially with the volume of the music.  i couldn't even hear our waitress at times.  but overall, a great place and i'd definitely come back!", 
            "it's always been a ritual to come here when ever my friends and i are in vegas. however i think some dishes are not as great as they used to be...the <mark>Creamy Spicy Crab</mark> for example was very salty and the uni was just ok. the strong dishes this time around were the washu beef, jalapeo yellowtail and the <mark>Black Cod Miso</mark>.", 
            "unfrigginbelievable!!  i went last saturday for a friends bachelor party and it was just an amazing experience of food.  there were 12 of us and after looking at the menu for 2 min, we just said f-it and just asked the waiter to bring the best stuff out.  \n\nwent down like this...\n\n2 huge plates of <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> and tuna tataki\n<mark>King Crab Ceviche</mark> which was incredible\nkobe beef served sizzling on hot stones which i would've just preferred rare but still excellent medium rare\n<mark>Black Cod Miso</mark> filet (wait...things are still getting better??)\nhuge plate of sushi to top it all off\n\ntasted even better comped :)\n\ni cannot wait to go back here!!", 
            "i've been to nobu in the bahamas and miami. i honestly thought it was nearly comparable to the one in miami with one exception...\n\n<mark>Black Cod Miso</mark> cod.. loved this in miami, however it tasted slightly fishy in vegas. i think if this was the first miso cod i had ever tasted, i would have enjoyed it.... but it couldn't live up to it's miami counterpart! my bf commented the filet seemed to be cut different and not as well.. perhaps if i order it again, it will impress next time. \n\nseared <mark>Teppan Style Foie Gras</mark> special... although this place is a sushi place, this was the best thing we tasted! seared <mark>Teppan Style Foie Gras</mark> in a strawberry sauce.. shot of sake infused with raspberries and a side oftuna poke.. mmmmm. they had some dumb thing you're supposed to do where you eat some tuna, take a shot, then eat the <mark>Teppan Style Foie Gras</mark>.. this actually worked! the flavors blended beautifully. \n\nnegi-toro .. as usual, this roll was incredible. not fishy at all and very light tasting. \n\nkampachi.. incredible! one of the top 10 pieces of fish i've tasted. again, not fishy, this is key.. smooth, buttery, amazing. \n\nps- service was great.. far better than service i had in miami. the -1 star is for the disappointing miso cod.",

            "wow. i was seriously impressed with this place. this place ranks second to french laundry on my list of favorites. \n\nfirst- if you are a first time visitor there, i would recommend just ordering off of the menu. i am sure the omakase is great but you have to try the signature dishes- and you may not get to try them all with the omakase. \n\nsecond- don't have the sushi be your primary focus. it's okay- but the other items are so much better. we saw people around us doing nothing but order sushi- what a waste! \n\nthird- the warm dishes tended to be larger portions than the cold and raw dishes. just a fyi if you want to budget your appetite and your wallet. i also felt that the dishes with a tart factor (see below) were too overwhelming. i would pass on these- imo the tartness is so much you can't enjoy the other flavors that might be there. \n\nwe started with edammame and the sheshito peppers. pass on the edamamme - there is nothing great about it- and you don't need to fill up your tummy with average stuff. the sheshito peppers were really good. they taste like small green bell peppers and the miso and sesame sauce on top has a great flavor. my husband is so picky when it comes to veggies and he even enjoyed this. my only word of caution- occasionally you get a spicy one! \n\nso we relied on our fellow yelpers and ordered the following items: \n\n1. <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> - definitely get this- it was awesome! \n\n2. the blackened miso cod- by far, the highlight of the evening \n\n3. chilean sea bass- cooked the special of the day way (yummy)- it had tomatoes, and onions, some white wine sauce \n\n4. kobe beef on skewers- pass- it was okay but not great \n\n5. <mark><mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark></mark>- pass- the tartness was way too overwhelming \n\n6. red <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark> - pass- again, tartness too overwhelming \n\n7. then we ordered some basic filler items- tempura, sushi (ca rolls and ama ebi)- all which were fine. \n\n8. we ordered the <mark>Bento Box</mark> dessert- it was ok- not fantastic. \n\noverall- the meal was great. the <mark>Black Cod Miso</mark> cod was so good- it had the right blend of sweetness with saltiness, and the fish was so tender it literally melts in your mouth. the chilean sea bass had the same texture and effect, but it costs about twice the amount as the black cod (a tidbit for those of you who are watching the $$s). \n\nwe had starved ourselves earlier in the day and were totally stuffed by the end of the meal. the whole meal with tip was just over $300. i highly recommend this place. it was the only restaurant that we went to in the older part of vegas that was great.", 
            "went here on a saturday night. we got there at 10:30pm and it was still packed. we ordered the yellowtail sashimi w/ jalapeno, very good. followed by the <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark> roll and <mark><mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark></mark>, both were good. i wouldn't say anything spectacular but good nevertheless. the best for last, the <mark>Black Cod Miso</mark> lettuce wrap was very good. it's sweet, buttery, hot & cold, soft & crunchy. the dish was the highlight of the evening. the gf enjoyed the miso immensely. we also had the <mark>Bento Box</mark> dessert, simple but good. service was good to us.\n\nbeing nobu, you pay a pretty penny for a small amount of food. ok...you'll drop a few bills here. but it's worth going to, esp. if you never been.", 
            "simply an awesome dining experience!  give yourself a good 2 - 2.5 hours to savior every moment of the food and your time here!  excellent service, scrumptious dishes, and fresh sushi!  you're going to be paying a pretty penny after all's said and done, but it will be your honor because this is fine dining at it's best!!!\n\nrecommendations:  omakase + <mark>Black Cod Miso</mark> + kobe beef", 
            "let me preface this review by saying that i am not a seafood lover. i dislike the fishy taste and smell. so when my friends wanted to do dinner at nobu during our visit to vegas, you can imagine my skepticism. \n\nwith that said.................. nobu not only met but exceeded any expectations that i had! every plate that i had was delicious. everything was fresh, no dirty fishy smell. i even had sashimi for the first time! the way that they pair their foods, whether its the sashimi with a small piece of jalapeno on top and light drips of soy sauce, or the <mark>Black Cod Miso</mark> (the waiter warned us that no soy sauce was necessary... he was right! the cod looked plain but was marinated with so much flavor) wrapped in lettuce... or the tempura shrimp with a dash of seaweed sprinkled on top.. amazing. i just loved the food, the decor, and the presentation of the plates in general.\n\nnow, nobu has definitely changed my view and taste (or distaste, at least before!) for japanese food. of course, nobu has also made me a friggin japanese food snob, but that just shows that even though their food is pricey, you definitely get what you pay for.\n\ni would definitely be willing to shell out some serious dough to eat here again.. i wish they had one in the bay area!!!!!",

            "so i've been here a half dozen times in the past 6 months for birthdays and business dinners. for those that know how & what to order this is honestly the best japanese in las vegas. when i read the low star reviews it's obvious the ordering went awry, so i'm going to use this review as a class in what to get at nobu 101:\n\nfirst my dont's:\n*do not come here with a low budget in mind . you will pay over $100 pp  if you want a satisfying amazing meal. i've come in here and tried to do it \"cheap\" and walked away angry and disappointed. wait to dine here until you have the budget to do so properly. \n*do not order off the main menu . it's boring. the food isn't that great. steak is blah. tempura is blah. seriously avoid avoid avoid.\n*don't order sushi rolls.. this should go without saying!!! \n*don't blindly get the chef's omakase. you'll likely end up disappointed.\n*don't order the shit you get at your normal sushi place and compare it. order exotic cool things you can't get at home.\n\nnow for what to do!:\n*peruse the \"special\" menu and also talk to the waiter about other goodies they might have hiding in the back. literally all my great meals here have been 100% off the main menu. the off the menu items are by far the best\n*be open minded and try the interesting off the wall stuff. it will really blow you away. i've found the waiters to be really down to earth and cool here.. use them as a resource. tell them what you like/don't like and ask for recommendations ! \n\nlastly, i'll leave you with my favorites. most are off the menu. most are seasonal. yes, it's a grab bag what they'll have when you decide to dine here but honestly i've never been disappointed when ordering this way ! \n\ncold:\n*barracuda. omg. best sashimi i've had in my life. who knew!\n*tazmanian <mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark>. my next favorite. basically like a mild buttery salmon. \n*<mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> with pineapples\n*kampachi. i do prefer this prepared the yellow tail jalape\\u00f1o way instead of the yellow tail. once you've had wild yellow tail it's hard to order the normal one ever again ! \n\nhot:\n*<mark>Black Cod Miso</mark> cod lettuce wraps... with <mark>Teppan Style Foie Gras</mark>. insanely good.\n*the huge fried fish in that amazing buttery sauce. definitely not for the dieters or light eaters. get 1 of these if you have a huge group. it's big and heavy\n*quail stuffed with pork belly (as amazing as it sounds!)\n\ncliffsnotes: avoid ordering from the main menu. it's boring, uninspired and won't excite you. be brave and bold when ordering, don't come with a limited budget. enjoy!", 
            "oh nobu, you are definitely deserving of a 4 star review, but alas our server (name withheld) decided that serving us wasn't in his best interests.\n\nnow before i utilize yelp to complain about sub-par service i must document the highlights, because as we know, an amazing kitchen can make up for lacking service.\n\nthe <mark>Black Cod Miso</mark> was a life changer. you owe it to yourself to have this dish.\nalso the <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> was such a wonderful combination of flavors, that honestly, i can't find words to do it justice.\n\nnow as to why nobu earned 3 stars from me instead of 4. our service lacked in every area, inattentive, unwilling to suggest menu items for our group of 5, and at times seemingly spiteful. why did you bring us (2) rock <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark>? it's delicious don't get me wrong, but two? \n\nmaybe the malice was because 2 people in our group were very late, and he was missing out on those <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> tips, or because they couldn't include gratuity? i don't know. but when i'm spending $60-70 per person, i expect a little more.", 
            "nobu i love you!!\n\ncame here on a vegas trip with one of the girls and this was our first stop! we dolled up, drove to the hard rock where there is valet parking, and walked into the center of the first floor where this ridiculously delicious restaurant is located.\n\nservice-great! everyone was really attentive. i always had my water filled, any finished dishes cleared off within the minute. the food came in really good timing as well. i was starving going in and i didn't have to wait. although coming from a restaurant like this i didn't expect anything less.\n\nthe decor is really comfy and not as fancy as i'd originally thought (or the other nobu restaurants apparently). you can definitely get away with begin pretty casual or dressing up your attire. while there were only small groups there they had some large tables <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> hidden rooms for even larger groups so if you need to bring a lot of people it seems as thought they'd be able to accommodate for more people.\n\nnow onto the best part of all! fooood is so worth the price!!\ndessert: lemme start with this one because i cannot get over the delicious trio of soy caramel, miso apple cinnamon donuts and a really delicious home made <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark> with toasted pecans. their pastry chef changes the dessert menu every season to go with what's in season which means i'm going to have to come here every season :)\n\napart from that we enjoyed the <mark>Black Cod Miso</mark>, eggplant miso (best i've ever had, decent portion but very rich), <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> (not spicy and very fresh!), <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark> (the garlic chips <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> great texture but the citrus oil sauce was too overpowering) and the shiitake <mark>Mushroom Salad</mark> (very strong citrus vinaigrette but delicious mushrooms to make up for it)\n\nawesome experience and a high price but definitely worth it :d", 
            "maybe it was the time of day, but the overall fare was too salty for my tastes... the <mark>Black Cod Miso</mark> cod was good, but much of the remainder left a rather neutral impression.\n\nparticularly unsatisfying was an order of crab sautee.  salty, heavy and indelicate, i cannot offer this place high marks.\n\nbetter were the sashimi selections.  again, my primary complaint was that it still seemed like the flavours were heavy handed.", 
            "i love vegas and i love sushi. and this is the perfect place for both. inside the awesome hard rock hotel, nobu is amazing on all fronts: food, service, atmosphere - maybe not price, but just deal, it's vegas!\n\nthe drinks are tasty and the food amazing.\ntry the avocado tempura (yes), the <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark> roll, the unagi sashimi, rock <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark> (awesome), and the <mark>Black Cod Miso</mark> (out of this world), thanks to our amazing waiter we also tried the tacos (i know) and they were mouth watering. i wish we ordered more of those! the waiter hooked it up for an amazing meal.\n\nthanks vegas, you never disappoint.", 
            "went here on valentine's day for a company function and i am going to say--hands down--the best japanese food/sushi in my entire life! none of the dishes disappointed me and i couldn't wait for each dish to come out as they got better and better as the meal went on. \n\nsupposedly the owner of the company that took us here is a big deal so we got excellent service. the waiters and the chef knew who he was so we got taken care of. i went to show someone where our table was (literally not even a minute) and my napkin was refolded at my seat. \n\nthis is what we had:\n\n-edamame\n-<mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark>\n-rock <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark> with cream spicy sauce\n-rock <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark> with butter ponzu\n-<mark>Black Cod Miso</mark>\n-chilean sea bass with dried miso\n-beef tenderloin (medium rare) in a claypot\n-<mark>Mushroom Soup</mark>\n-pickled sushi platter  \n-sushi platter\n-ceviche with mixed seafood (and quail egg)\n-fish egg sushi with quail egg\n-sweet potato and avocado tempura\n-dessert: chef's tasting platter\n\nalcohol: i had a mango martini--delicious! i don't really like to taste alcohol, but this was a good sweet/tart drink that got me slightly buzzed. good tasting + getting buzzed = winner!\n\nsome highlights of the meal: \n-the seafood was amazingly fresh and it was the best quality i've had. my top favorite was the <mark>Black Cod Miso</mark> and the chilean sea bass. melt in your mouth heaven. \n-beef tenderloin was perfection--i love my meats medium rare and it was good and bloody. \n-i did a shot of the ceviche with a raw quail egg and it was great. you only live once, and if you want to try something might as well do it at nobu since they know how to prepare it properly. bottoms up!\n\ni'm so glad i went with a company because there is no way i would have been able to 1. afford all of this food and 2. to order this many plates. nobu is great and i would gladly go back if i had the chance!", 
            "i'm japaneeeeesey fosheeeeezy!\n\ni ordered edamame, <mark><mark>Lobster <mark>Miso Soup</mark></mark></mark>, the <mark>Black Cod Miso</mark> cod, aji (nigiri), hamachi & scallion hand roll, and an order of kampachi (nigiri). \n\neverything was a reminder to me of japanese excellence! the service was great & all the dishes were a delight to indulge in on my glutunous time in vegas! \n\nthe alcohol was a bit pricey but i needed both sapporo's and sake to fully live japanese... which i am 100%", 
            "my buddy and i went to nobu this past friday night at 9:30 for their omasake chef choice tasting menu. we had very few disappointments. they sat us right away at the bar, tables would have been 15 minutes even with our reservations.  lots of good energy in the restaurant, lots of japanese yelling back and forth from the waiters and sushi chefs.  we split a $50 bottle of nonfiltered very fragrant nigori sake cold which was smooth and easy to drink. the small bits of rice at the bottle of the bottle reminded me of red wine sediment as a good thing. \n\nthe first course came out quick and cold. a chilled patty of toro tartar in a soy wasabi sauce topped <mark>Yellowtail or Salmon <mark>Blue Fin <mark>Toro Tartare</mark> with Royal Ossetra Caviar</mark></mark>, served with a baby silver spoon.  it was tender, smooth, rich and melt in your mouth.  the caviar was not memorable.  an a+ start and an expensive dish on their regular menu. next was 4 pieces per plate of thin cut fresh octopus topped with a cilantro leaf, a dot of super hot sauce, finished with citrus, like ceviche.  pretty good.  next was another cold appetizer of rice paper wrapped greens with a piece of raw ebi sweet shrimp, dressed with a fantastic sesame ginger sauce with a fried prawn head on the side.  my buddy especially liked the tempura batter on the <mark>Sweet Shrimp with Fried Head</mark> and the dressing.  i will personally come to your house and kill you if you do not eat the fried prawn head. \n\nthen started the hot plates.  first was the ever famous <mark>Black Cod Miso</mark> cod, a bit too sweet for my buddy but it did not keep us from both licking the plates.  a small piece of tender fish which just went on and on and kept melting in our mouths.  flavor of fish hard to come through past miso and sweetness.  like fish candy in a good way.  my friend said that an improvement would be to torch and crisp up the skin before putting on the sauce which would give some texture contrast and make the dish over the top.  $23 on the regular menu.  next was the beef tenderloin toban yaki style with a shitake and enokitake mushrooms and a piece of thin asparagus in a soy broth. beef very lean, not as melt in your mouth as i would like.  my buddy would have liked a nice piece of ribeye cap instead but who wouldn't.  the dish is served spitting hot on a mini hot plate and when they raise the cover in front of you, the steam envelopes you warmly.  try not to get the grease on you. \n\nnext was the nigiri sushi course of 5 pieces along with a nice clam <mark><mark>Lobster <mark>Miso Soup</mark></mark></mark>. we got a piece of <mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> (mmmm), magura tuna (so tender), yellowtail (yum), clam (a bit tough) and <mark>Sea Eel</mark> which was the most tender fall apart <mark>Sea Eel</mark> i have ever tasted.  the sushi rice <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> fill you to the gills by that point and then they hit you with the dessert which was a bento presentation of a warm flowerless chocolate lava cake with lots of lava and very little cake and a very good not sweet green tea <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark>.   this just put the nail in the coffin.  we were stuffed, but we couldn't stop eating since it was so good.  \n\nthe restaurant closed at 11pm on a friday night, but we will remember the meal for a long time coming.  next time i'm in vegas i plan to make it a point to return and see what the chef choice is at that point in time.  this was the $100 omasake.  the $150 would have <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> some kobe beef and <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> and there.  we were very happy with our choice.  i think the meal was an absolute bargain for the price.", 
            "5 stars.  hmmm, what else can i say?  ordered the <mark>Black Cod Miso</mark>!  simply heaven. sake serving ware is cute. ambiance and decor is tres chic!  bring some $!", 
            "went here as a party of six. \n\nhad the omakase $100 option. yelpers were pretty accurate on dishes like the <mark>Black Cod Miso</mark>. good, but a little sweet. this is definitely not the place for hand rolls and sashimi. everything was presented well and at the end, i was kinda satisfied. \n\nonly three stars for me because it cost me $150 after one beer and splitting some sake four ways. the food was kinda heavy, so i felt very bloated after. i also felt like having sushi the next day, so the only urge it satisfied, was the one to have a bougie dining experience. too much hype. if you want a bougie meal to impress, this is the place. for an outstanding eating experience, this is not it.   \n\nglad i went. not going back.", 
            "first time going to nobu and i'd say it was definately a pleaser.\n\nmy friends and i decided to go to nobu after hearing it was voted one of the best restaurants in las vegas.\n\nservice: amazing. excellect. outstanding.\n\nfood:  over the top quality food.  i can't remember all the food we had but the ones that stood out.  <mark>Black Cod Miso</mark>. yellow tail cold dish. my only disappointment would be the rolls.  i'd stick to the cold dishes and hot dishes and stay away from the rolls.  sushi quality fish covered up in rice and seaweed.\n\nif i stayed at the hard rock again i definately would go back.", 
            "hands down my favorite place to dine anywhere on earth. i make sure i dine at nobu everytime i visit vegas (which is quite often). they have lots of \"signiture\" dishes and they always have a \"new\" or \"special\" item or two on their menu. here's a little secret, they have quite a few other \"signiture\" items that they do not even place on their menu, be sure to ask your server about a few of the great items not listed such as the <mark>Black Cod Miso</mark> glazed lettuce cups. the place has an up-beat vibe, modern decor and great music playing, also some of the best people watching in town. it's also very common to run into celebs dining there as well. it's a little bit pricy, expect to pay at least $100 per person with a couple of cocktails each(that's prob on the low side to be honest), my last visit cost me over $700 for 3 people but worth every penny, i have paid more at other places in the past for far far less. as with most any place fri and sat evening are their busiest, reservations at peak dining hours 8:00-10:00pm on these nights usually book up 3 weeks in advance so make sure you plan ahead.\n\nside note; i have eaten at both the nobu in la and miami and neither of them compare to the one in vegas, i'm really not sure why??? i would give la 4 stars and miami 3 stars. if you had a mediocre or bad experience at another nobu give the one inside the hard rock in vegas a shot, you will be delighted.", 
            "expect to spend some money if you go here. don't be cheap! nobu is a great place to go for a special occasion or... if you just have..... a lot of money. the sushi is definitely fresh and the warm dishes are absolutely delicious! the inside is clean, nice and has modern decor. the sushi bar is quite large and there's also a bar and lounge in the front. the spicy <mark>Big Eye Tuna Roll</mark> is different from any other place that i've tried. it does not have the minced up tuna but instead a nice, thick slice of tuna with a spicy, scallion sauce. also, the rolls have the rice on the inside not on the outside, like you find at most places now a days. the rolls are small, so they fit right into your mouth with one bite. some things that i recommend are the <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark>... it is to die for. the yellowtail is fresh and the jalapeno pepper gives it a little kick. the <mark>Black Cod Miso</mark> is absolutely delicious, it melts in your mouth. the rock <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark> is really good as well. they also have new cocktails every month, so ask your server or the bartender what the special cocktails are. the lychee martini is really good!\n\nnobu is also a great place to spot celebrities. if you dine here you'll most likely see at least one celebrity. it's a hot spot.\n\ntry nobu and you won't be disappointed but i have to say again, don't be cheap!!! enjoy the ambiance and the great food.", 
            "i had never been to any of the nobus but i was expecting a lot for from this restaurant - for these prices, i expect to have something, anything, jump out at me and slap me across the face.\n\ntwo of us went and tried the following:\n1) <mark>Salmon / Salmon Belly</mark> - $30. meh - had a wierd honey mustard sauce on them.\n2) uni tempura - $15-20 (i forget) - it was okay but nothing special.\n3) <mark>Black Cod Miso</mark> - $20ish - fine, but this is a cliche at japanese restaurants at this point.  they tried to offer it in \"lettuce wrap\" form which should have been a huge red flag.\n4) live scallop - the best dish we tried - simple, spicy. i forget the price.\n5) big mistake - kobe beef tacos. $42. three tacos, half the size of our palm, and tasted like street meat. \n\nit was difficult to avoid fried, saucy, overwrought dishes.  if i were to characterize this restaurant in one sentence it would be:\n\njapanese cheesecake factory.\n\nwe ordered a couple bottles of sake which pushed up the final price, but we wound up spending about $180 per person for a very mediocre meal that left us still kind of hungry. \n\natmosphere (in the hard rock hotel) was also subpar - could have been any vegas restaurant and the service was not particularly good either.\n\nif you're going to blow this kind of money, spend it at the spearmint rhino.",

            "sometimes food can be an earth rocking experience, and that sometimes, summarizes every single visit i've ever had to nobu.\n\nthere really isn't much i can say at this point that can convince you this is one of the finest japanese restaurants in the country. 400+ yelp reviews, and almost all of them are 4 and 5 stars.\n\ni will just leave you <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> advice:\n\n1. don't come here drunk. you will leave with a bill that is closer to a g. you may not enjoy it as much either.\n2. order the <mark>Black Cod Miso</mark>. hands down the best dish that i've ever tasted.\n3. you can come in a large group, but groups of 4 are best. they serve small plates. intimate dining at it's best.\n4. service is solid, be sure to tip well. this isn't the outback or chili's. don't treat it like your typical vegas fare.\n5. yes, it's a chain now. it never used to be. but the quality hasn't skipped a beat.\n6. go to nobu in every city you visit (if there is one).\n7. make a reservation.\n\nfollow these rules, and you will have one of the best dining experiences of your life.\n\nbe prepared to spend some coin. it is worth it. \n\npeace out.", 
            "a sushi place in vegas automatically rings alarms in my head.  i thought they would overprice everything for average food.  absolutely not.  this place had prices that you'd find anywhere in dc/md/va.  the only thing that was better than the quality of food was the quality of service.  our waiter gave us honest recommendations, paired our foods with sake, and didn't even include gratuity on our party of 9.  obviously we tipped him big time for all his work.\n\nall the rolls were all amazing.  the <mark>Black Cod Miso</mark> appetizer was money.  i can't think of a single negative thing about this restaurant.  don't be afraid to spend money here, and don't go to vegas if you don't have money to spend.\n\nthis will be my go-to place whenever i'm in vegas.", 
            "let me preface this review by saying that i'm a huge self-admitted sushi <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> and my husband is peruvian, so nobu seemed a logical choice for our 7th anniversary dinner.  aside from the villainous penny slots  just outside the door, it was the perfect choice. \n\nwe started out with the <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark>.  yellowtail is by far my favorite raw fish and i've had a similar dish at several excellent bay area restaurants, but this was by far the most flavorful rendering of this dish that i've had. the sashimi was also not razor thin which was an awesome <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> bonus (honestly, i've gotten use to the fact that fine dining, particularly in vegas, means small portions and high prices so the amount of fish was a pleasant surprise. \n\nnext, we tried the tiradito nobu style <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> type of halibut like fish.  now, here the fish was razor thin, but came out with a dot of rocoto, a block of rock salt, the traditional lime juice and a side of cilantro.  my husband says this is exactly what tiradito is supposed to taste like, which makes me want to spend significantly more time in peru.  it was amazing.\n\nwe then moved on to the <mark>Black Cod Miso</mark> next and honestly, this was the only part of the meal that i was underwhelmed by.  i know that this is supposed to be the signature hot dish at nobu, but i've had a very similar dish at both morimoto napa and at hyakumi at cesar's palace and the texture of the fish wasn't the melt in your mouth awesomeness that i have come to expect from the dish. the flavor was right on, and if i'd never had black cod before, i would have loved it.  \n\nso, we moved back to the cold dishes and tried the <mark>White Fish <mark>Scallop <mark>Salmon <mark>Oyster <mark>Beef <mark>Yuba Sashimi New Style</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark> salmon sashimi (<mark>White Fish <mark>Scallop <mark>Salmon <mark>Oyster <mark>Beef <mark>Yuba Sashimi New Style</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark> because it's served with ginger, <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> other amazing deliciousnesss that i can't recall right now), finishing off the savory with the toro green onion maki (cut).  they were both amazing. \n\nwhat shocked me was how incredibly amazing the two <mark>Dessert</mark> we had were.  we tried the <mark>Bento Box</mark>, a flourless chocolate cake with house-made green tea <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark>, and this peach cobbler like dish with almond miso crumble and ginger <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark>.  i don't know if anyone else finds some green tea <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark> to sometimes taste vaguely like lipstick, but this <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark> was delicate and a beautiful companion to the rich chocolate cake.  the warm peaches with the crumble and (again not overpowering) ginger <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark> was a highlight of my whole trip to vegas.

            "i was skeptical, but nobu delivered. i just finished dinner with a friend of mine and i had to write a review before i forgot the details. let's just get to the chase.\n\nmy friend and i walked in and i asked our server what the best three dishes were. he then recommend these three. i felt like a stuck up food critic requesting the chef hit me with his best shot. but i often do this for restaurants that i've never been to. after dinner, i find myself recommending the same. here's the pro and cons:\n\n1) toro carpaccio- okay, $70 for six pieces of fish can be a little on the steep side, but hey, i had to know what it was about. now i know and here's the scoop. the toro is incredibly delicious. it is amazingly tender, quite possibly the most tender toro i've ever had. the fish alone is a star, but the flavor profile that the chefs prepare is pretty impressive too. capers, truffle shavings, truffle oil <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> dressing over greens really hit the mark. i will say that there was a little too much soy sauce for my taste (that's right, i'm chinese and i'm saying it). i would request they served the sauce on the side, but fear they will substitute excess soy sauce with hate.\n\n2)<mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark>- this was almost my favorite dish of the night had it not been for the sheer flavor of the toro. the yellowtail is served as one would expect from an expensive sushi restaurant: fresh, flavorful, tender and seasoned according. the jalapeno slice was perfect- excellent spice without burning my mouth. i would actually recommend this as a first dish. \n\n3) <mark>Black Cod Miso</mark>- i thought this was a little overrated by the other reviews. cooked to near perfection, the cod was warm inside but seared and slightly crispy outside. the miso glaze wasn't much to look at. for me, it resembled gravy. i've seen others' pictures and theirs looks much nicer. nevertheless, the dish was great. i actually prefer black cod cooked slightly medium, but cooked to the core with awesome texture. sweet miso sauce finished off the dish and made it very enjoyable. \n\n4)<mark>Sea Urchin</mark> sashimi or sushi!!! just order it. \n\nmy friend and i were pretty hungry and ordered other dishes but i must say that they didn't exactly knock me off my feet. overall, many of the other dishes were very good, but just not amazing. here's the list:\n\n-<mark>Salmon Skin</mark> hand roll- thin slices of <mark>Salmon Skin</mark> with gobo, rice and seasoning. nice to have a place serve quality over quantity when it comes to the <mark>Salmon Skin</mark>.\n\n-baracuda <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark>- $40 for six slices of barracuda. very interesting texture as i haven't had barracuda before. the lemon/citrus sauce was a bit too much. again, i see this as how the chef intends the dish to be enjoyed, so i simply eat and keep my comments to myself. \n\nlive scallop- again, great cut of <mark>Scallop</mark>, but nothing special to write home about. it was nice that it was served with muscle in ponzu sauce. \n\n<mark>White Fish <mark>Scallop <mark>Salmon <mark>Oyster <mark>Beef <mark>Yuba Sashimi New Style</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark> oyster- four pieces of kumamoto oysters served ready to enjoy. so you have to eat it the way they prepare the seasoning.\n\ncrispy rice w/ <mark>Nobu Crispy Rice with Big Eye Tuna</mark>- for lack of a better term, it's japanese tatter tots. square rice cubes deep fried served with essentially tuna poke. well prepared, tasty, but nothing special. \n\nall in all, it was a great experience. my general assessment is that nobu serves dishes with strong flavor profiles. not exactly my cup of tea. maybe i'm a fond believer that less is more and that the fish should speak for itself. however, i can appreciate the fact that a chef's dish is his own art. so i eat with an open mind and share my interpretation. hope this helps.", 
            "this review is long overdue.  every time we visit las vegas, nobu is a must for us.  the service, ambiance, drinks, and food get a a+.  we always get the <mark>Black Cod Miso</mark>, it is to die for.", 
            "one of my favorite places to eat when i go to vegas. first of all if you are going on a tight budget, don't bother. albacore was great, <mark>Black Cod Miso</mark> unreal, <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> aw some, kobe beef like butter. this past trip we had whole new zeland snapper. it was unbelievable. we went with 2 other couples and our bill was $1200. may sound steep, but that included some of the best sake and sapporo reserve beer too. i would pay it again in a heartbeat!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! our server was one of the best i have ever had. ask for him if you can; jamie. he had us covered the entire night <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> of his recommendations were the bomb.", 
            "had the omakasa style with friends and it came out to be about $250/person doh!! (we did drink a lot of saki from the bamboo decanter though...)  great meal, super fun and tasty.  the highlight was the <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> on ponzu and the <mark>Black Cod Miso</mark> on lettuce wrap.  very great restaurant and amazing service.", 
            "considering it's located at the hard rock hotel, the atmosphere was not as loud as the floor and the lighting was perfect with a modern decor.\n\nnow to the food, since it was my first time there the server recommended i try their specialty dishes. which i did and was floored by the flavors, started with the yellow tail sashimi with jalape\\u00f1o, to the <mark>Black Cod Miso</mark>. now i did stray from the servers recommendation and ordered the chef's sashimi which was ehh. next time i will certainly follow the servers recommendation and would recommend to stick to their signature dishes. what made up for the ok sashimi was dessert and there are many to choose from, i ended up going with the vanilla tapioca. sake was a bit pricier than usual but well worth the money. service was slow but perfect to enjoy a nice dinner and discuss the evening's events with your companion.\n\nall in all, i would definitely return and try their beef wagyu beef or other signature dishes. note this is not a cheap dinner by any stretch and expect to spend at least 150 per person but well worth it for the atmosphere and the experience.", 
            "7/2: nobu hard rock rivals yellowtail @bellagio as my all-time favorite restaurant. i've been here one previous time and i don't remember much, but nothing bad. i just kept comparing it to my favorite, which is kind of unfair. however, this time was different...very memorable in a good way. \n\nmy server gordon and his waitstaff team's service was amazing! i had the locals tasting menu ($75) and it was worth every penny. every dish was cordially described in just the right amount of detail before being served. all questions were answered in a friendly manner. the atmosphere was very nice and classy as well. beautiful decor. \n\n-kobe beef taco (as an appetizer, separate from tasting menu)...best taco ever! beef was soft and moist\n\n-<mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> (best sashimi i've ever had by far! so soft and fresh. price tag aside, i could go for 10 of these plates! though that might be too much of a good thing)\n-tuna <mark><mark>Nobu's Moriawase Sashimi Salad</mark></mark> (love it. best tuna ever) \n-rock <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark> with creamy spicy (best shrimp ever...you're getting the point! i didnt know shrimp could taste this good) \n-<mark>Black Cod Miso</mark> (this and the yellowtail sashimi were my favorite dishes...high praise for these 2 seems to be the trend based off of many reviews. definitely no disagreement here. best fish ever! if you are ordering one item, i highly recommend it) \n-assorted sushi and <mark><mark>Lobster <mark>Miso Soup</mark></mark></mark> (basics but pretty good. large <mark>Scallop</mark> were <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> to the soup. unique taste and interesting twist compared to standard <mark><mark>Lobster <mark>Miso Soup</mark></mark></mark>. delicious!) \n-dessert (strawberry, vanilla, green tea <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark>)...all were great. not really a complaint, but a variety of <mark>Dessert</mark> is preferred. im sure they would be amazing like everything else as well.\n\nthank you nobu, for one of the best dining experiences ever. i will definitely be back!",

            "first of all, please choose the right nobu restaurant.  you should be going to nobu in hard rock hotel.   if your pocket book is a little tight this is not the place i would recommend you to go. \n\ncold dishes: \nspecial: toro (don't remember what he listed as the garnishes, but it is shown on my pics.  i think this dish was just a little salty. once, you <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> the dressing on top, i like to taste the fish, since it is fresh.)\n<mark>Kelp Salad</mark> 13 (this tasted so fresh, <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> just a little lemon on top of it.  also, helped w/cleaning the palette for the next course) \n<mark>Sea Urchin</mark> 16 (this is from santa barbara, ca which is normally where every japanese restaurant from the west coast gets there uni from.  hmmm..this just tasted like any uni i would have gotten at another bay area restaurant probably no more than 12.00.  oh well, i do love my uni. \n\nhot dishes: \n<mark>Black Cod Miso</mark> 37  (this was cooked well and the miso glaze on top was just right) \n\ngeez i forget the server's name, but he was really great!  knowledgeable about his fish and the menu.  very upscale and modern experience.  this is the 2nd nobu location i have been to, first was in hong kong.  if you like fresh fish w/a twist of fresh ingredients, you just have to come here and experience the taste.  but don't come here if you are looking for affordable specialty sushi rolls, this is not that type of place.  this was the first time my friend had gone to this restaurant, she said it was the best japanese restaurant she has ever been to.  i was so pleased to have taken her there 1st.  hope they do open up in san francisco soon!", 
            "i love this place.  the food is always great.  the service is phenomenal.  the staff always make sure you are taken care of.  everytime we come here, the chefs are always talking to the guests to see how everything is going.  \n\ni would recommend the omosake menu.  let the chefs give you the best things from the kitchen.  just tell them what you can't have and then will make you a happy person. our favorites our the <mark>Black Cod Miso</mark>.  i saw someone say it was too sweet but i disagree.  it's perfect.  the yellowtail sashimi is my wifes favorite.  one of their options last fall was a shaved asparagus and crab salad.  i still have dreams about it.  \n\ncan't go wrong.  it is expensive but very reasonable compared to other restaurants, especially on the strip",

            "i came back four years later and this place is still so good! so good that i went twice in one week which is very unusual for me especially with all the great places vegas has to offer. the items that stuck out for me were the <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> (simple but omg all the flavors work so well together...and that sauce that it comes with is delicious), <mark>Salmon / Salmon Belly</mark>,  <mark>Black Cod Miso</mark>, <mark>Nobu Crispy Rice with Big Eye Tuna</mark>, <mark><mark>Lobster <mark>Miso Soup</mark></mark></mark>, and the kronuts! and the service was absolutely impeccable!",

            "after our free pitbull concert from one of our work vendors, we were hungry!  for appetizers, we decided to go to the culinary dropout, so for dinner, we decided to go to the next restaurant, nobu.  i've heard amazing things about this place and knew that it was top notch.  heck, i've seen it on keeping up with the kardashians. as good as i know the food would be, i also knew the price tag would be pretty hefty!\n\nwhen we got in, i noticed and array of seating.  chairs, tables, booths, bar, you name it.  the green back splash of the bar really went well with the light colored wood framing around the rest of the restaurant. you felt like you were at a super trending japanese restaurant.  it just felt high end!  our server was nice, but knew we had a bunch to drink.  we put our menu in his hands.  here's what we got (with prices):\n\n-<mark>Kumamoto Oyster with <mark>Bone in Ribeye 24oz Nobu Sauce</mark></mark>  18\n-<mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark>  24\n-<mark>Uni or Oyster Shooter</mark>  12\n-salmon sashimi   24\n-<mark>Mixed Seafood Ceviche</mark>  22\n-<mark>Snow Crab</mark> <mark><mark>Nobu's Moriawase Sashimi Salad</mark></mark>  28\n-tuna (big eye) sushi 12\n-salmon sushi 10\n-yellowtail sushi 12\n\nsome of these items came in a sushi platter.  i wasn't too sure how the platting and combination went.  all i know is the fish was super fresh.  the aesthetics of each plate was like a work of art.  i felt like i was a kardashian! lol.  our total bill for 7 people, came to $780. oh-em-gee!  for a nice, elegant night, to me, this was worth it.  such amazing food and great atmosphere.  i will definitely return!"

            "amazing!!! were the first words i thought of when i was dining and leaving this restaurant.  my best friend recommended this restaurant as we were planning our vegas trip.  i didn't think much about this place when he brought it up, my expectations were pretty much non-existent.  once we got to the restaurant, it was top notch from start to finish.  we ordered quite a bit of different dishes and it was delicious down to the last bite.  our waiter was quite helpful with our decision making and recommendations.  first dish on our table was the fresh <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark>.  this dish is awesome!  the flavoring along with the fresh yellowtail easily makes this my favorite dish at this restaurant.  we also had the monkfish pate, <mark><mark>Nobu's Moriawase Sashimi Salad</mark></mark>, black cod <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark>, broiled yellowtail collar; <mark>Creamy Spicy Crab</mark>, rock <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark> <mark>King Crab with Amazu Ponzu</mark> and creamy spicy sauce.  all around delicious dishes with great visual presentation.  their lychee martini is also worth a mention, a tasty treat.  i highly recommend this restaurant for those who haven't tried it yet.  this is easily one of my top 10 restaurants.  just a wonderful experience from beginning to finish!", 
            "the visit was on a labor day sunday around 6pm.  the last visit to this particular nobu was back in 2003 when i didn't know the difference between a piece of foie and a rubber sole.  i recall having the chef special back then as well, but the omakase this time was definitely more enjoyable.  this was probably due to the fact that i wasn't three sheets to the wind this time.  being married does these things.\n\nthere were those that chose the bronze omakase ($100) and those that went for the silver ($150) like yours truly, and boy was there ever a difference.  there were major discrepancies between the cuts and also the types of meats served.  the sashimi and the speciality dishes also had noticeable differences.  it's not to say that the 100 dollar omakase wasn't good, but it wasn't great...at least from my vantage point.\n\nthere's about a zillion details i will be leaving out, such as the dried flakes of hoo-haa sprinkled with a drizzle of the thinger thang.  so use your imagination..\n\ncourse 1 - a bonito sashimi.\ncourse 2 - amaebi splashed with hot oil, chawan mushi with truffle and crab eggs at the bottom, kampachi sashimi with dried miso flakes.\ncourse 3 - toro sashimi <mark>King Crab with Amazu Ponzu</mark> ginger sauce <mark>Yellowtail and Jalapeno</mark> sauce topped with a bunch of edible flowers which made it all purdy and crap.\ncourse 4 - seared <mark>Scallop</mark> on a bed of sea beans.\ncourse 5 - kobe beef (served medium) with pan fried <mark>Teppan Style Foie Gras</mark>.\ncourse 6 - sushi set (nigiri) <mark>Inaniwa Pasta with Lobster</mark> broth and <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark>.  the set consisted of - toro, abalone, spanish mackerel, eel, tai (<mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark>) and tamago.\ncourse 7 - an array of sweets including <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark>, chocolate looking souffle thing, fresh fruits and other sugary confections we couldn't stay for because we were already late for the friggin cirque du pouffay show.\n\n..\n\nall in all, a great meal.  i enjoyed the silver omakase at matsuhisa better, the wife liked this dinner much better.  definitely a strong 4 star, but nowhere near a five.  the highlight of the meal for me was the foie served over the kobe.  the dish was so luxurious i really was at a loss for words as i was enjoying every delectable bite.  the slice of black truffle in the chawan mushi gives you a big mule kick in the face which was in short, heavenly.  \n\ni was surprised to find that i liked the non sushi dishes better than the raw, but is it such a huge surprise?  we live in cities like la, sf, ny, etc. where quality ingredients are so readily available.  i've had sashimi as good if not better in other restaurants.  most don't serve it with the detail and ingenuity like mr. nobu matsuhisa, but it takes way too much money to surprise this sushi cowboy.\n\ni truly don't mean to sound snobbish, but there's only so many ways to serve up a nice slab of toro.  i'm more impressed these days by the way chefs serve up foie.  and i am totally infatuated with bone marrow.\n\n..\n\ni've said too much.  \n\ni am off to eat.\n\nedit:\n\ni don't know if it was because we were in vegas, but i felt like everything was a bit contrived.\n\n*shrugs*", 
            "if it were only about the sushi, nobu would get 5 stars from me. but, i knock off 2 stars for service. we walked in on a saturday night and got seats at the sushi bar, which is the place to be. we went with our sushi chef's suggestions, which were nobu's <mark>House Special</mark>, including \"new-style sashimi.\" these consist of the best fish, <mark>White Fish <mark>Scallop <mark>Salmon <mark>Oyster <mark>Beef <mark>Yuba Sashimi New Style</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark>, with delicate sauces and garnishes: <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark>, live octopus with a peruvian chili paste, whitefish and salmon <mark>King Crab with Amazu Ponzu</mark> sauce, tuna <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark>-mustard sauce. everything was first-class, including the junmai daiginjo sake.\n\nthen, i ordered the <mark>Bento Box</mark> chocolate cake dessert. we were told it would take 8 minutes to cook. no problem - our bellies were happily full of sashimi. 20 minutes later, however, still no dessert, and we finally were able to flag someone down to check on it. another ten minutes went by. our waiter then came out to tell us there was a mixup in the kitchen and our cake went to another table. he tried to give us a plateful <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark> to tide us over - this didn't go over well, as the last thing we wanted was to eat a plateful <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark> and then a chocolate cake. another ten minutes or so, the dessert came out. it was excellent, but frankly wasn't worth waiting over half an hour for. we ask ed for the check while still eating...took another ten minutes...gave the credit card and another ten minutes went by...waiter came out to tell us the credit card isn't clearing and do we want to give another card? by this point, well over an hour had gone by since dessert was ordered and we just wanted to leave already. \n\nwhen our check finally arrived, they did charge us for the dessert that took over 30 minutes to arrive at our table. when i mentioned this to the server, he took it right off the bill. but i was miffed that i even had to ask - the right thing to do would have been to take it off in the first place.\n\ntoo bad, since up until we ordered dessert we were very pleased with the sushi our wonderful chef served us. even for a saturday night in vegas, the service was unacceptably unresponsive for such a high-end restaurant.", 
            "i spent a week in las vegas at the hard rock hotel for nye this year. it was not my first visit to nobu, so we were very much looking forward to a meal there.\n\nas always, it was fantastic. the cucumber martini was so very refreshing i am still craving it. the yellow tail <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> has the best citrus soy sauce - we actually came back & got a drink & this dish again before we went out another night because it was so good & light. we also had the <mark>Lobster <mark>Tuna <mark>King Crab <mark>Vegetable <mark>Salmon Nobu Style Taco</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark> which were great.\n\nfor hot dishes, we had the rock <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark> <mark>King Crab with Amazu Ponzu</mark> sauce and the black cod <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark>. can you say melt in your mouth? this is the reason i return to nobu again & again.", 
            "i ate here for a business dinner and sat at one of the tables but ordered omakase from the sushi bar.\n\nmy colleagues and i went big and went with $150 a person so we had high expectations...\n\ni will try my best to remember everything that came out...(not in order)\n\nthe first dish was a salmon trout sahimi with ikura eggs inside.  the fish had some chewy veins in it, and there wasn't any type of sauce on it - i guess we were supposed to enjoy the 2 components together.\n\nthere was a dish of fatty tuna (otoro) on top of a rock salt.  this was unique and the fish was melty\n\nthere was a <mark><mark>Lobster <mark>Miso Soup</mark></mark></mark> type dish that came out that used delicious dashi broth - anyone who understands umami would've enjoyed this\n\nkobe beef with special mayo sauce was good, but nothing spectacular\n\n<mark>Scallop</mark> in a green guacamole sauce was edible, but the balance wasn't completely there\n\nkanpachi <mark>King Crab with Amazu Ponzu</mark> sauce <mark>Yellowtail and Jalapeno</mark> was good too but trendy\n\nin the end, a full platter of sushi came with the trademark \"nobu\" mark on the egg sushi - this was perhaps the most dissapointing.  the fish tasted bland, the rice was somewhat hardened like it was sitting out for a while, and i really would've liked to end the night on a high note but this last platter of mediocre sushi ended the night on a low note\n\nand the bill at the end was not a pretty sight...\n\ni probably will not go back to nobu again unless it's free.  i was just expecting so much more because of all the hype.  \n\nhowever on the plus side the service is excellent - the servers are all very attentive.  and the atmosphere, being inside the hard rock hotel, is hip and lively.", 
            "unbelievable meal. would not recommend getting sushi here the cooked dishes are definitely the way to go. sushi was pretty standard but very expensive.  i was not wowed by the quality of the fish and considering the price i think there are better spots for sushi.  the fried snapper, chili paste and truffle oil edamame, hamachi <mark>King Crab with Amazu Ponzu</mark> sauce,  and <mark>Crab <mark><mark>XO and Jamon Iberico</mark> <mark>Beef <mark>Crab Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark></mark> balls with <mark>Spicy Tuna (Big Eye)</mark>. were some of my favorite dishes.", 
            "usually when a restaurant has this much hype i'm disappointed.  it's hard to live up to hype.\ni'm happy to report...no disappointment here!\n\nwe had dinner there last night.  our server was thomas and he could not have been better.  one of the best servers we've ever had.  he was friendly, on top of it and fantastic about explaining the restaurant, menu, food and the area the food comes from.\n\nwe went for sushi, but after thomas explained the menu we realized we should be eating what the restaurant does best.  so glad that we did!\nour server recommended we have 4-5 dishes for the two of us.  we went with every dish that he suggested.\nwe had...\n*yellowtail sashimi with jalepeno.  amazing.  this was my favorite dish of the night.  i want to eat it every day. \n*<mark>Nobu Crispy Rice with Big Eye Tuna</mark> tataki <mark>King Crab with Amazu Ponzu</mark>.  delicious!\n*black cod <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark>.  also amazing.  this was my second favorite.  someone said it \"melted in my mouth\".  this is the perfect way to describe it.  also, so flavorful!\n*broiled yellowtail collar.  delightful!\n*<mark>Mixed Seafood Ceviche</mark>.  my husband loved this, i thought it was just okay.  i think it was just my taste though, i don't love cucumbers or octopus.  \n\nprices are high, but i definitely would recommend nobu to anyone looking for an amazing meal.", 
            "i must admit, i have not been to a nobu that i didn't like.  so yes, i am a fan of this high-end japanese chain restaurant.  we had dinner here this past friday night.  unfor<mark>Tuna (Big Eye)</mark> i am not fond of the hotel that it's located in... which is barely a step up from a hooters-type ambiance with the class-less tatted out clientele and their hoochie mama's attached to their hips.  well back in the day hard rock was the place to go to... but that was years ago.  so the fact that one has to step foot into the hard rock casino to get into the entrance of this restaurant... should really get a minus star for not strategically relocating this at a more ritzy hotel casino like bellagio or cosmopolitan.   \n\nwe started off with cocktails... lychee martini and a greyhound... can't go wrong there.  as for the app...started off with the sea salted warm edemame.  i was so hungry, i practically ate all the soy beans.  i ordered the yummy <mark>Kelp Salad</mark> and he ordered hamachi sashimi with jalepeno... so perfectly fresh <mark>King Crab with Amazu Ponzu</mark> sauce or miso... so good!  he ordered the <mark>Shrimp or <mark>Scallop</mark> with Wasabi Pepper or Spicy Garlic</mark> was sinfully delicious... (fried so not a healthy choice).  and i ordered the chilean sea bass with dried miso... my all time favorite, which did not disappoint!  salmon, hamachi and unagi sushi... small but still so good.  and we ended with yet another cocktail :-) and the <mark>Bento Box</mark>.... flourless chocholate cake with white chocolate sauce and green tea <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark>... omg!  amazing dinner with outstanding service.  yes nobu is expensive but i was for<mark>Tuna (Big Eye)</mark> that he was so generous... so not really sure what our bill was... but so worth every bite.",

            "nobu.\n\nwell, what can i say?  i've wanted to go to nobu for a really, really long time.  being in vegas for the weekend, i decided this would be the time to do it. \n\nwe started with an assortment of sashimi.  tuna, mackerel (which was completely delicious) and a couple others .... my brain stopped operating clearly after the mackerel.  then a large platter of raw chilean sea bass with enoki and baby bok choy.  a warm ginger infused mushroom broth was ladled over the fish table side which cooked the melt-in-your mouth, luscious bass ever so gently.  mmmmmmm.\nnext came tempura king crab legs with an accompanying  broth (which had sensational body) poured over the tempura right before eating.  it was amazing.  my husbands eyes rolled back into his head- i thought that he was having a seizure.  then came the spicy <mark>Big Eye Tuna Roll</mark> <mark>Eel and Cucumber</mark> roll.  both good.  but the item that stole the show had to be the uni.  and i mean in a bad way.  so i've never had uni.  i know that is super lame.  but i've been waiting until i was at a really good establishment because i wanted to be sure that i was getting the best uni prepared by competent hands.   my fantasy of being super cool vanished in a swift goopy instant.     eeeeeewwww.\nso it came pureed and then wrapped <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark> 'd.  wow.  well, having always prized myself on being somewhat of an adventurous eater i dove in head first, offering myself as the guinea pig.  big mistake!  i take a bite.  the exterior is nice and crisp.  within an instant my mouth was flooded with velvety toxic sea puke, orange ooze dripping on my plate below.  maintaining composure was very difficult- however, this practice will come in handy once the check comes.\n-abalone wasn't much more pleasant- similar flavor with the texture of chewing on somebody's ear.\nthank god a clever distraction appeared soon thereafter the \"uni incident\".  super thin slices of beautifully marbled raw kobe beef on a large platter with six super hot rocks and an assortment of condiments and seasoning.  so we got to cook our own slices of kobe using our chopsticks as our instruments on the hot rocks.  can we say fun?  i've always wanted to do that.\ndessert sounded cool on the menu but in actuality it didn't taste too hot.  i did like the shiso sorbet though.\n\nthe reason why i have given nobu 4 stars instead of 5 is because the fact that i had to go to the skanky, garish, soulless, death trap that is vegas in order to dine there and because of the price.  even as i am writing this i cannot believe what i am about to say.  i am accustomed to spending 250$ or so on a nice dinner .  in this instance i was prepared to pay around 500-550$.  but for a party of four, with no alcohol bill to speak of and 2 people confessing that they were still hungry upon our exiting, the bill came to 700 big ones.  ouch!  gees- i have to confess feeling mildly nauseas directly afterward.  am i just a cheap ol' broad?  or have i gone and acquired some sort of conscience or something?  something just felt really wrong about that.    i just feel like it was self indulgent and empty.  but, then again, i guess that pretty much sums up vegas.", 
            "i agree with ming-jou in the fact that i was totally disappointed at this place. i should have also listened to my friend who went there and was really disappointed at their omakase, but being japanese, i wanted to try their food to see what the hype was about.  we had reservations at 9 pm and although we got there earlier, they didn't seat us till then.  it was shockingly a loud place that we often had to yell at each other to talk and even to order.  also, the crowd was much older than i anticipated.  the interior had a nice asian feel to it with bamboos everywhere, even on the ceilings.\n\nfor starters, we had edamame, yellowtail tartar <mark>Yellowtail or Salmon <mark>Blue Fin <mark>Toro Tartare</mark> with Royal Ossetra Caviar</mark></mark>, <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark>.  the menu was vague that we didn't expect any sauce with the tartar, but to our surprise, it came in a sauce with wasabi that was a little spicy.  i wish the menu would have included more details.  we got to order individual tempura items, which was a \"first\" for me.  we ordered shrimp, broccoli, and sweet potato.  the order came with 2 pieces each.  i liked how it came out really hot with light batter.  also, they were generous with their tempura sauce with daikon-oroshi (grated daikon).  most places give you barely enough sauce.  for dinner, we shared the <mark>Sushi Dinner</mark> which came with 8 nigiri and 6 pieces of tekka maki (<mark>Big Eye Tuna Roll</mark>).  the sushi rice tasted old as it was cold and flat, not warm and plump.  also, the rice portion for a nigiri was much more than it needed.  fish seemed fresh, but the rice was disappointing.  that ruined my dinner.\n\nwe decided to try their dessert since we don't usually order dessert at an asian restaurant.  we tried their miso almond cake which was the best part of my meal.  it came <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> caramel glaze and edamame <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark>.  the cake was yummier than i expected.  \n\noverall, it was not as good as i expected but i'm giving 3 stars for the good dessert and the great service.", 
            "ok, i'm a sushi snob. i admit it.b\nthe setting in this place is too loud. \nfood was ok.\nwe went for the omokase dinner - which starts at $100/person. this was a sponsored dinner, so these comments are void of any financial influence.\n\ntuna tartare on a lotus root chip. decent - tuna was ok, not too fatty. the chip had some kick to it.\nback to back sashimi dishes. boring. fish was ok, but smothered in ponzu. \nsquid and mushrooms - quite tasty. squid perfectly cooked. earthiness to the shrooms.\nlettuce cups <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark> cod and grilled scallop. the best dish of the night.\nsome kind of spicy rock shrimp with a mayo dressing on top of a bed of greens. it wasn't bad, but not quite what i wanted. the greens were good.\nsteak - not kobe, but damned good. heavily seasoned.\nfinished with calif roll and spicy <mark>Big Eye Tuna Roll</mark>? are you kidding me?\nbeer and sake flowed; service was good. i ate here many years ago and the service was so bad, but this time they did well. \n\nwe had fun as it was a group that hadn't been together in a long time and as i said i didn't pay, but i would say for the money, there is better food in vegas and better sushi in many places. if i had paid for this dinner, i would probably have knocked off a full star.", 
            "nobu definitely qualifies for some of the best sushi i have ever tried. keep in mind that if you're thinking on ordering your basic california roll, spicy <mark>Big Eye Tuna Roll</mark>, etc.. it'll be a waist of your money. some of the things i tried were the miso black cod, yellowtail sashimi with jalape\\u00f1o & barracuda sashimi...all were amazing by the way.  don't forget to try their saki as well, a bit expensive but worth every penny.  i've eaten here twice and i can see myself coming back for more.", 
            "expect to spend some money if you go here. don't be cheap! nobu is a great place to go for a special occasion or... if you just have..... a lot of money. the sushi is definitely fresh and the warm dishes are absolutely delicious! the inside is clean, nice and has modern decor. the sushi bar is quite large and there's also a bar and lounge in the front. the spicy <mark>Big Eye Tuna Roll</mark> is different from any other place that i've tried. it does not have the minced up tuna but instead a nice, thick slice of tuna with a spicy, scallion sauce. also, the rolls have the rice on the inside not on the outside, like you find at most places now a days. the rolls are small, so they fit right into your mouth with one bite. some things that i recommend are the <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark>... it is to die for. the yellowtail is fresh and the jalapeno pepper gives it a little kick. the <mark>Black Cod Miso</mark> is absolutely delicious, it melts in your mouth. the rock <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark> is really good as well. they also have new cocktails every month, so ask your server or the bartender what the special cocktails are. the lychee martini is really good!\n\nnobu is also a great place to spot celebrities. if you dine here you'll most likely see at least one celebrity. it's a hot spot.\n\ntry nobu and you won't be disappointed but i have to say again, don't be cheap!!! enjoy the ambiance and the great food.", 
            "went i went to this particular nobu four years ago, it was outstanding. perfection on all front. really some of the best food and service i've ever had. since then, i'm not quite sure if my palate has become more discerning and/or nobu has lost just a little of it's shine. either way, it was still a great meal overall. \n\nhubs and i made a reservation here for my birthday dinner while in vegas. we put a note in the reservation stating so and while it's not a huge deal, we didn't hear happy birthday from our host, server or receive any sort of birthday love. our server was just fine, although he didn't seem to be the happiest of lads. maybe he was having a rough night. regardless, we went on an ordering spree and here's what we snacked on...\n\njalape\\u00f1o hamachi: 5/5: bright, flavorful and incredibly fresh. exactly what i remember about nobu! \n\nehu: 4/5: per the server a new-ish item on the mean, ehu is a short tail <mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark>. i've yet to taste ehu before, but it's a flaky white fish. taste overall was a bit overworked with multiple elements on the plate, but it was tasty. \n\nrock shrimp: 3/5: last time i was at nobu, hubs and i ordered two servings of this. not heart healthy but it used to be creamy and delicious with the shrimp perfectly flash fried. this go around it was clumpier, sticker and not quite as creamy. \n\nblack cod: 3/5: another dish that i used to love. this visit the cod was watery and lacked the complex flavor the miso previously provided. \n\nspicy <mark>Big Eye Tuna Roll</mark>: 4/5: standard <mark>Spicy Tuna (Big Eye)</mark>. fresh, delicious and on the mark. \n\nthis visit was a good one but not a great one overall. i'm still a fan of the ambiance and the creative menu items so here's hoping i came on an off-ish night!", 
            "this place came highly recommended to us by a waiter at another restaurant (thanks for the complete disappointment eduardo!).  these are the dishes i tried:\n\n- <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> - was spectacular!  the flavors of this dish were very fresh and enjoyable\n\n- <mark>White Fish <mark>Scallop <mark>Salmon <mark>Oyster <mark>Beef <mark>Yuba Sashimi New Style</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark> sashimi salmon - was basically thin slices of poached salmon drowning in sesame oil\n\n- albacore sushi - thin slice, nothing special...\n\n- salmon sushi- thin slice, nothing special...\n\n- spicy <mark>Big Eye Tuna Roll</mark>- wasn't spicy and the nori wrap was gummy\n\noverpriced and completely not worth it.\n\nand my new pet peeve - do not wipe the table down to prep for the next customer while i am still sitting at the table waiting for my check.  clearing the table is fine, but seriously?  it's completely rude and i think after we dropped $200.00 and only took up about 45 minutes of their time, they could have waited- especially since there were plenty of empty tables around us.  will never go back.", 
            "perfect end to our epic girls vacay!\n\ni want to give a special shout out to our server who rocked (pun intended). the service was phenomenal! \n\nour theme of the weekend turned out to be lmfao's 'sorry for party rockin' and when we told our server he let us keep our zen rocks, get it? rocking! aw, good times.\n\nmust haves:\n- black cod <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark> \n- toro sashimi (shout out to our waiter who helped me trick my friends who were squimish about trying fatty bluefin tuna belly. he told them it was compliments of the chef. after they fell in love with it we told them the truth and enjoyed a good laugh about it.)\n- <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark>\n- spicy <mark>Big Eye Tuna Roll</mark> \n- dessert: the chef's tasting platter was so yummy that someone swooped on a part of mine. they even put candles on it for the girls birthdays.\n\ni would also like to note that the presentation of dishes was extremely entertaining. their descriptions are as magical as the flavors. i want to give a special thanks to the server who served jessica h.'s dish with such an amazing description that it left the entire table wishing we had ordered chicken teriyaki.\n\nat this point i must admit that our two large daigijo sakes prevent me from making any other recommendations. i can honestly say that the food and service were amazing and the tab was worth every penny. i cannot wait to go back or perhaps try the nyc location.\n\nside bar:\n\nbathroom situation: i hated that the bathroom was outside the restaurant and is shared with the not so lovely patrons of rehab day club. at least hard rock was nice enough to install a syringe disposal. \n\non the bright side we also found out that nobu will be opening a location at cesar's palace, which i think will be a much better fit for this fabulous culinary experience.\n\nthe table next to us was doing omakase style. so jelly, it looked amazing! when i go to the cesar's location i will be doing omakase.", 
            "we planned to have dinner with our friends who live in vegas on one night of our two night stay there recently. after scouring the restaurant recommendations from my friend, we decided on nobu. sometimes i have to be in the mood for sushi, i don't always crave it like other people i know, so i was worrying about committing to a reservation. i was also worried about having to pay a million dollars (slight exageration; i don't even have a million dollars, and if i did, i would only spend half on wine) for any good wine. (true story, i made the mistake of ordering a glass of wine at the bar in the casino at the flamingo (don't ask) one night and it had me wishing for manischewitz.)\n\nok - back to the matter at hand: nobu has now made me crave sashimi, sushi and all japanese food all the time. not only did the server rattle off, in detail, and totally and completely from her memory, just about every item listed on the menu, but the food was amazing. i die. we had a smattering of everything from each \"category\" and honestly, went a bit overboard, but it was a meal well worth going over board on. \n\nwe dined on:\n\n-edamame\n-<mark><mark>Lobster <mark>Miso Soup</mark></mark></mark>\n-tempura fried rock shrimp <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> type of delicious citrusy, creamy sauce\n-<mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> (out of this world)\n-red <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark> (also, amazing)\n-salmon <mark>White Fish <mark>Scallop <mark>Salmon <mark>Oyster <mark>Beef <mark>Yuba Sashimi New Style</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark> sashimi, which was lightly seared and served with green onion, absolutely delicious\n-<mark>Soft Shell Crab</mark> roll\n-spicy <mark>Big Eye Tuna Roll</mark> (cause, come on, you gotta round out the meal)\n\nthe dessert was good but unremarkable. i'm more about the main event.\n\ncap that <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> amazing gin cocktail that i now forget the name of and two glasses of hellaciously expensive, but delicious, sauvignon blanc, and this is one of the top meals i have had in my little life thus far... \n\nin short, take your gambling winnings to nobu and order everything the server suggests.", 
            "nobu is simply a fantastic restaurant! my family of 5 got the groupon for couples for food tasting. it's a 5 course meal where they start you off with appetizers, entrees , then dessert. the appetizers given to us (edemame and peppers) were alright. nothing special, as you can get them from any restaurant or store. however, what really impressed me greatly at nobu was the yellow fin tuna sashimi! i love sashimi, and eat it all the time. however, after eating this, it simply couldn't compare to any sashimi i've had anywheres. the servers were kind enough to recommend us that we don't use ginger and wasabi, for this could ruin the taste that the chef wanted in the first palace. i was glad i didn't use ginger/wasabi for this sashimi, since it was simply so tasteful and great! afterwards, they served us black cod and rock shrimp which were great, but nothing crazy. i was sort of disappointed in the last entree they served us, a plate of sushi. it was simply slices of tuna and salmon on balls of rice. nothing special. they also served spicy <mark>Big Eye Tuna Roll</mark> and california roll on the entree. these sushis were simple, nothing great or special. it seemed that nobu really lacked in that dish. it was just.. plain. couldn't nobu do better than serve a dish that any sushi restaurant could make? \n\nto conclude, service was amazing ! great and honest staff. the feel and ambience was good and quiet. the lighting was good as well. \n\ni would highly recommend this restaurant, especially the yellow fin tuna sashimi!\n\nfood 4/5\ncleanliness 5/5\nservice 5/5"

            "i was in vegas this past weekend for a bachelorette party. and when we found out there was a nobu here (see my nyc review since i had been to that one quite a few times), we had to come! i was in charge of the ordering since no one else from the party had been there. \r\n\r\nthe decor is similar to new york's nobu, but not as big and not as nice. the service is not as good but it's vegas so oh well.\r\n\r\nwe ordered:\r\n\r\npeach martini and lychee martini - very good but strong.\r\n\r\n<mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> and ponzu sauce - this was fucking good. one of my friend's doesn't eat sashimi and she loved this dish. (see below for kristine n's review). they prepared it with about 20 pieces of sashimi on the plate for our big party! it was great!\r\n\r\n<mark><mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> Salad</mark> - of course i had to order this! i love the salad dressing. \r\n\r\nmiso black cod - the cool thing about nobu is that because we had a group of 8, they actually cut the fish in chunks and put them individually on little lettuce wraps so it would be easier to eat. this was fantastic and sweet.\r\n\r\nchilean sea bass w/ mushrooms - the bride-to-be is a sea bass connoisseur and she said this was not chilean sea bass, but just regular sea bass. it was still very good though. yummm.\r\n\r\nsquid pasta - i love the squid pasta here. complimented w/ asparagus. i love asparagus!\r\n\r\nrock <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark> - we choose the butter sauce since the other sauces had been a bit spicy. yummy.\r\n\r\n<mark>Bento Box</mark> - flourless chocolate cake with <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark>. this was better than i remembered from nyc. it's not flourless as in a chocolate bar on a plate - it actually does have a cake - souffle texture to it. it was great, and gooey in the middle. \r\n\r\nmango caramel ice-cream dessert - a light but tasty dessert with caramel bits in it.\r\n\r\none of the girls and i are not big seafood fans, but we loved all the dishes here. (see below for kristine n.'s review!) that tells ya something! everyone thoroughly enjoyed this meal which made me happy because i hoped they would trust my judgement in food. =)\r\n\r\nit was nice because they brought out each dish one-by-one so you aren't stuffing your faces all at once. by the end of the dinner, we felt extremely satisfied but not so full we were going to explode.\r\n\r\nyay, for nobu!!!",

            "i really wanted to try nobu after having an amazing experience at morimoto in philly.  i was not disappointed.  we arrived promptly at our reservation time and were seated immediately.  upon being seated we were greeted by our server within moments.    the atmosphere at nobu is much different than morimoto...nobu is more lively and trendy.  \n\nthey have you order a few dishes from the three parts of their menu.  we started with the oysters and the <mark><mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark></mark> which is served in lettuce wraps.  the lettuce wraps were quite good and the oysters were very earthy tasting. \n\nfor our second course we chose the <mark>Creamy Spicy Crab</mark> and the rock <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark> in butter ponzu.  the <mark>Creamy Spicy Crab</mark> may be one of the best dishes i've ever tasted in a restaurant.  at the end of our weekend i asked my brother in law what his favorite thing was about vegas and he responded without hesitation \"eating <mark>Creamy Spicy Crab</mark> at nobu.\"  not the club, not winning $300, not seeing old friends....the <mark>Creamy Spicy Crab</mark>.  \n\nwe chose 4 sushi rolls for our main course, the house roll which is like a rainbow row except the fish on the inside, a spider roll, unagi avocado (not on the menu but they happily prepared it for us) <mark>Yellowtail and Scallion</mark>.  each of the rolls was well prepared and the fish was fresh.\n\nfor dessert we ordered assorted mochi, which caused brother in law to wet himself for the second time that night.  our assortment included tiramisu, pistachio, honeydew, and raspberry.   all were amazing.\n\nthe service was outstanding throughout the night.  the meal was well paced, it wasn't the lingering three hour affair we had at morimoto but we didn't feel rushed at any point.  in the end i felt that the bill was actually fairly reasonable for what we ordered.  including tip and alcohol it came to about $90 a person.  i do have to <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> it did bother me slightly to find that some of the customers were wearing sneakers, open toe sandals (on men) and collarless shirts.  when i made our reservation they informed me that the dress code did not include these things, which is totally fine.  i'm all for getting dressed up to go out to eat, especially in vegas, and especially at a place like nobu, but i do not like it when i go through the effort and others don't have to.", 
            "if we overlook the fact that the restaurant wrote down our reservation for 10 for the wrong night, my group's dining experience here was exceptional and we were pleased that they were still able to seat us despite this error. the service was incredibly fast (3 people from our group were late and we completely finished our meal by the time they arrived,) and the food was fabulous. the flavors were crisp, unique, and every bite of food was like an explosion in my mouth. since we shared all the dishes we ordered, that pretty much means that we only got one bite so we savored it for all that it was worth. damn you nobu for being so expensive! otherwise i would have ordered 2 of everything!\n\na couple of dishes i would recommend trying are:\n-<mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark>\n-toro tartar <mark>Yellowtail or Salmon <mark>Blue Fin <mark>Toro Tartare</mark> with Royal Ossetra Caviar</mark></mark>\n-black cod <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark>\n-rock <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark>\n-new zealand mussels with the garlic sauce\n\n***the must try dish is the fish/<mark>Lobster <mark>Tuna <mark>King Crab <mark>Vegetable <mark>Salmon Nobu Style Taco</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark>!!!***\nthey are not on the menu here, but you can special order them and they are awesome. i have pictures to prove it.", 
            "amazing!!! were the first words i thought of when i was dining and leaving this restaurant.  my best friend recommended this restaurant as we were planning our vegas trip.  i didn't think much about this place when he brought it up, my expectations were pretty much non-existent.  once we got to the restaurant, it was top notch from start to finish.  we ordered quite a bit of different dishes and it was delicious down to the last bite.  our waiter was quite helpful with our decision making and recommendations.  first dish on our table was the fresh <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark>.  this dish is awesome!  the flavoring along with the fresh yellowtail easily makes this my favorite dish at this restaurant.  we also had the monkfish pate, <mark><mark>Nobu's Moriawase Sashimi Salad</mark></mark>, black cod <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark>, broiled yellowtail collar; <mark>Creamy Spicy Crab</mark>, rock <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark> <mark>King Crab with Amazu Ponzu</mark> and creamy spicy sauce.  all around delicious dishes with great visual presentation.  their lychee martini is also worth a mention, a tasty treat.  i highly recommend this restaurant for those who haven't tried it yet.  this is easily one of my top 10 restaurants.  just a wonderful experience from beginning to finish!",

            "3 words miso marinated cod!\n\nok so we decided to go to las vegas on my friends birthday during his quater life crisis (there is such a thing).  this was the first restaurant we chose to dine at.\n\nfirst off it's at the hard rock hotel.  i don't like this place one bit.  it's over rated and think nobu doesn't fit in this environment of tacky rock n roll memoriabilia minus nirvana.  \n\nok we go in and get drinks first at the bar.  salty dogs are great and they make it damn good at nobu. \n\nwe get seated 20 minutes later even with reservations, this place gets busy.  our server comes and asks us what we would like to order.  we pretty much had the chef's tasting menu and we're glad we did.\n\nfirst course- <mark>Spicy Tuna (Big Eye)</mark> and i think dragon roll- it was good, but come on i can getthose rolls anywhere, give me something interesting!\n\nsecond course- tempura rock shrimp with spicy aioli <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark> <mark>Vegetable</mark> <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> glaze.  very good and for how simple it looked the sauces made it very complex. \n\nthird course- yellowtail with jalepeno and citrus ponzu- amazing!  so damn good i would have eaten just that and be satisfied.  pepper seared rare ahi with chili vinegar sauce- again give me a plate of this and i would die a happy man.\n\nfourth course- miso marinated cod- this is by far the best seafood dish i have ever tried.  the fish was so tender, and the skin was crisp and flavorful!  simply heaven. \n\nfifth course- trio of sorbets\n\ni must say the food was great minus the first course!  <mark>Spicy Tuna (Big Eye)</mark> and dragon roll at a high end japanese restaurant?  i don't know for a tab of $400.00 for 4 people i think that <mark>Spicy Tuna (Big Eye)</mark> is not needed!", 
            "mmmmmmsashimi: i agree with most of the other reviewers about the sound level but luckily we were seated at a table for two next to the bamboo room divider. the level of service from our waiter was impeccable. he was helpful, engaging, and honest about the pros and cons of the menu. we shared a large bottle of nigori sake and edamame - which was seasoned with this light and feathery-textured sea salt. yum. i was disappointed that they did not have spanish mackerel that night but i consoled myself with the <mark>Sashimi Dinner</mark> plate. the salmon was simply mouthwatering and the tuna was perfect as was the yellowtail, <mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark>, ebi, white fish, mackerel, and squid. david ordered the <mark>Spicy Tuna (Big Eye)</mark> <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark> shrimp rolls and an order of unagi. for dessert i had the banana \"toban yaki\" that had sliced bananas and strawberries simmering in calvados.",

            "nobu.\n\nwell, what can i say?  i've wanted to go to nobu for a really, really long time.  being in vegas for the weekend, i decided this would be the time to do it. \n\nwe started with an assortment of sashimi.  tuna, mackerel (which was completely delicious) and a couple others .... my brain stopped operating clearly after the mackerel.  then a large platter of raw chilean sea bass with enoki and baby bok choy.  a warm ginger infused mushroom broth was ladled over the fish table side which cooked the melt-in-your mouth, luscious bass ever so gently.  mmmmmmm.\nnext came tempura king crab legs with an accompanying  broth (which had sensational body) poured over the tempura right before eating.  it was amazing.  my husbands eyes rolled back into his head- i thought that he was having a seizure.  then came the spicy <mark>Big Eye Tuna Roll</mark> <mark>Eel and Cucumber</mark> roll.  both good.  but the item that stole the show had to be the uni.  and i mean in a bad way.  so i've never had uni.  i know that is super lame.  but i've been waiting until i was at a really good establishment because i wanted to be sure that i was getting the best uni prepared by competent hands.   my fantasy of being super cool vanished in a swift goopy instant.     eeeeeewwww.\nso it came pureed and then wrapped <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark> 'd.  wow.  well, having always prized myself on being somewhat of an adventurous eater i dove in head first, offering myself as the guinea pig.  big mistake!  i take a bite.  the exterior is nice and crisp.  within an instant my mouth was flooded with velvety toxic sea puke, orange ooze dripping on my plate below.  maintaining composure was very difficult- however, this practice will come in handy once the check comes.\n-abalone wasn't much more pleasant- similar flavor with the texture of chewing on somebody's ear.\nthank god a clever distraction appeared soon thereafter the \"uni incident\".  super thin slices of beautifully marbled raw kobe beef on a large platter with six super hot rocks and an assortment of condiments and seasoning.  so we got to cook our own slices of kobe using our chopsticks as our instruments on the hot rocks.  can we say fun?  i've always wanted to do that.\ndessert sounded cool on the menu but in actuality it didn't taste too hot.  i did like the shiso sorbet though.\n\nthe reason why i have given nobu 4 stars instead of 5 is because the fact that i had to go to the skanky, garish, soulless, death trap that is vegas in order to dine there and because of the price.  even as i am writing this i cannot believe what i am about to say.  i am accustomed to spending 250$ or so on a nice dinner .  in this instance i was prepared to pay around 500-550$.  but for a party of four, with no alcohol bill to speak of and 2 people confessing that they were still hungry upon our exiting, the bill came to 700 big ones.  ouch!  gees- i have to confess feeling mildly nauseas directly afterward.  am i just a cheap ol' broad?  or have i gone and acquired some sort of conscience or something?  something just felt really wrong about that.    i just feel like it was self indulgent and empty.  but, then again, i guess that pretty much sums up vegas.", 
            "i agree with ming-jou in the fact that i was totally disappointed at this place. i should have also listened to my friend who went there and was really disappointed at their omakase, but being japanese, i wanted to try their food to see what the hype was about.  we had reservations at 9 pm and although we got there earlier, they didn't seat us till then.  it was shockingly a loud place that we often had to yell at each other to talk and even to order.  also, the crowd was much older than i anticipated.  the interior had a nice asian feel to it with bamboos everywhere, even on the ceilings.\n\nfor starters, we had edamame, yellowtail tartar <mark>Yellowtail or Salmon <mark>Blue Fin <mark>Toro Tartare</mark> with Royal Ossetra Caviar</mark></mark>, <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark>.  the menu was vague that we didn't expect any sauce with the tartar, but to our surprise, it came in a sauce with wasabi that was a little spicy.  i wish the menu would have included more details.  we got to order individual tempura items, which was a \"first\" for me.  we ordered shrimp, broccoli, and sweet potato.  the order came with 2 pieces each.  i liked how it came out really hot with light batter.  also, they were generous with their tempura sauce with daikon-oroshi (grated daikon).  most places give you barely enough sauce.  for dinner, we shared the <mark>Sushi Dinner</mark> which came with 8 nigiri and 6 pieces of tekka maki (<mark>Big Eye Tuna Roll</mark>).  the sushi rice tasted old as it was cold and flat, not warm and plump.  also, the rice portion for a nigiri was much more than it needed.  fish seemed fresh, but the rice was disappointing.  that ruined my dinner.\n\nwe decided to try their dessert since we don't usually order dessert at an asian restaurant.  we tried their miso almond cake which was the best part of my meal.  it came <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> caramel glaze and edamame <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark>.  the cake was yummier than i expected.  \n\noverall, it was not as good as i expected but i'm giving 3 stars for the good dessert and the great service.", 
            "i'm not going to lie--a small part of me dies every time i think about how much we spent here.  but the truth of the matter is, you can't get good sushi without paying for it.  \n\nwe ordered the $100 omakase, the uni tempura set, kabocha tempura, and salmon sashimi.\n\nthe fusion dishes (like the hamachi <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> or the snapper with cucumber <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Whole <mark>1/2 Maine Lobster</mark></mark> <mark>Roasted Poussin with Spicy Lemon</mark></mark> juice) were fun to try but i find that the sauces often overpower the fish, which is the best thing about nobu.  if you have never tried any of their signature dishes, you might want to order at least one of the omakase options, but if you're just looking to enjoy the fish qua fish, then order the sashimi and/or nigiri a la carte.\n\nand yes, let's talk about the fish.  i have never had such a wonderfully buttery miso black cod!  and the toro, maguro, aji, trout, and sake (as in salmon sashimi) simply melted in our mouths.  no biting necessary.  the only low point was that the anago in our complimentary sushi was littered with small fish bones but hey, it was complimentary!  yet another reason why i love nobu.  they know how to treat the ladies right.\n\nas for the tempura, the kabocha was out of season, so it was our bad for ordering it in the first place, but the uni tempura was unlike anything i have ever had.  every bite was bursting with succulence and the tempura batter <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> extra texture and flavor.  heavenly.  anyone who is a fan of uni and/or tempura needs to try this!  it also comes with tempura shiitake mushroom (luxuriously juicy), tempura shiso leaf (so crispy, so light), and one other <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark> that i forget but that my mom thought was delicious.\n\nthe dessert was lovely too--we had the <mark>Bento Box</mark> which consists of flourless chocolate cake and homemade green tea <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark>.  not too sweet and the perfect way to end a perfect meal.\n\ni seriously cannot wait to come back here again and try the <mark>Hamachi Kama</mark>, the snapper, the whole fried fish, and the squid salad.  is it expensive?  yes.  but is it worth it?  most definitely.", 
            "this is my second time here and both times i've come with my cousin. as much i love nobu, i only go there with her, since she loves it so much, but i never regret it. \n\nthe nice thing is i just let her order, since she knows what's good, but then if i ever go alone, i won't really know what to order. i did have a nice acai cocktail to start the night. it was delicious and refreshing, great way to start the meal. \n\nwe ordered the <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> which i loved since i love the spice. then we had the seafood spring rolls which weren't on the menu, but since they go there all the time, they knew about it. those were also really good, along with the <mark><mark>Nobu's Moriawase Sashimi Salad</mark></mark>. loved the dressing and there was so much sashimi! we also had the rock <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark>, which was kinda like popcorn shrimp, but really tasty <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> grilled beef thing. \n\nat the end, we ordered the <mark>Bento Box</mark>, which was a flourless chocolate cake with green tea <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark>. everything was really good, but service was a little slow. my other friends were also there and they were a party of 10. they started a little after us but finished before us!! other than that though, it was a great night.", 
            "went here on a saturday night. we got there at 10:30pm and it was still packed. we ordered the yellowtail sashimi w/ jalapeno, very good. followed by the <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark> roll and <mark><mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark></mark>, both were good. i wouldn't say anything spectacular but good nevertheless. the best for last, the <mark>Black Cod Miso</mark> lettuce wrap was very good. it's sweet, buttery, hot & cold, soft & crunchy. the dish was the highlight of the evening. the gf enjoyed the miso immensely. we also had the <mark>Bento Box</mark> dessert, simple but good. service was good to us.\n\nbeing nobu, you pay a pretty penny for a small amount of food. ok...you'll drop a few bills here. but it's worth going to, esp. if you never been.", 
            "it was saturday night in vegas, we wanted sushi, and nobu didnt even cross my mind until my boyfriend made reservations for the same night. i quickly logged on to yelp to check the latest reviews as i do with any restaurant, and i am happy to say that i am ecstatic i did this, because had i not, i would have missed out on the black cod <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark>.... which is without a doubt, one the best things that i have ever tasted. \n\nmy bf and i shared 4 dishes and 1 dessert, washed it down with 2 sapporo's each, and by the time we were done, we could barely walk!\n\n<mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> - delicious!!!! the sauce may be just a bit overpowering but delicious nonetheless. i couldnt even taste the jalapeno :)\n\n<mark><mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark></mark> - i have no clue why they are calling this \"ceviche\" but i wish we would have ordered something else instead. it was merely ok,  it just kind of tasted like cold <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> lettuce - but hey, i love <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark>  its all good :)\n\nblack cod <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark> - omg - i just got goosebumps thinking about this dish. it is hands down the best thing i have ever put in my mouth. i like how crunchy <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> it is..  delicioso~\n\n<mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark> roll - your basic roll ..  \n\n<mark>Bento Box</mark> dessert ( flourless chocolate cake with green tea <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark>) yum yum yum yum - this is a great combination - not too much,  shared <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> special is a perfect way to satisfy your sweet tooth.\n\nwill definitely come back - loved the all male service - everyone was really nice and our waiter pretty much gave us his thoughts on all the menu items and gave us some nice suggestions - that in hindsight, i should have taken.\n\n but hey, theyre's always next time!!", 
            "i've been to nobu in vegas twice before and in nyc once and always loved it, so, naturally, when in vegas with a friend, we made a reservation for dinner.  my friend is a big nobu fan as well, and we were both disappointed with our experience this trip to vegas.  what was great about the service - that they brought the dish, explained it and then left us alone to enjoy food w/o constantly checking in w/ us - also turned out to be an issue.  when we were ready to order more sake, we waited over 15 minutes, and, when no server had come to our table, my friend got up and found one to take our order.\n\nthe food this time was also a disappointment.  the rock <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark> wasn't as tastey as always, and the sushi rolls were just ordinary.  certainly not good enough for nobu prices.  the miso cod and yellow tail sashimi were both delicious, but the others were sub-par for nobu's reputation.\n\nsometimes, i'm not sure it's a good thing to have all the big name restaurants in vegas... if the big name chefs are elsewhere, the vegas fare seems to suffer.", 
            "i only had the sushi so i can't review the hot dishes, so here it goes. the <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> and yuzu was by far the best and the <mark>Nobu Crispy Rice with Big Eye Tuna</mark> <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark> shrimp were good as well, but not worth twice the price of a decent sushi place. i don't know what exactly i was expecting, but this definitely fell short.\n\nalthough the cucumber lychee martini was delicious. i would come back to try the hot dishes if someone else was picking up the tab, otherwise i think pink taco would probably be just as satisfying.\n\noh and i really wasn't that impressed with the decor, why is bamboo so luxe?", 
            "i don't know what happened to this place. my casino host would always make res for me to eat here everytime im in town but the last time i was there on labor day weekend it was terrible. i always get the same thing the <mark><mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> Salad</mark>, miso cod, rock <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark>, yellowtail jalopeno, and <mark>Lobster <mark>Tuna <mark>King Crab <mark>Vegetable <mark>Salmon Nobu Style Taco</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark>. this last trip, the only thing that tasted like it should was the <mark><mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> Salad</mark> and yellowtail. not what i was expecting from a chain nobu. i have even eaten at the san diego location recently and they have gone downhill also. bummer because i really use to like this place. maybe ill give it one more shot before i cut this place off.", 
            "my first visit to a nobu outpost was about 5 years ago at nobu next door in new york city.  at that point i was still evolving into the foodie that i am today, and for some reason, i absolutely loved the hot spot.  the food was innovative; the atmosphere was exclusive; and snagging a table was a super-heroic feat.  in the years that have passed since, nobu has expanded, and i have also eaten at their nobu 57 in manhattan and the vegas location.  as food culture and my passion for it have evolved, so has my dislike of nobu.  this chain has lost its unique luster, and the quality of the dishes has become a mixed bag.  while some hot and cold courses are better than others, almost anything beats their sushi, which tastes like something ordered from a supermarket's counter.  \n\nmy sushi-fanatic friend and i recently booked a trip to vegas, and her sister had insisted that she try nobu.  i knew that my friend was focused on it, so i went along with the recommendation, though i knew better.  we wound up heading there on our first evening, which at least paved the way for better and better meals as the vacation progressed.\n\nour reservation enabled us to get a table at the crowded spot, and we were immediately seated at a prime location in the center of the dining room.  my friend ordered a glass of sangria, while i opted for a fruity martini, which was so horrifically sweet that i needed to exchange it for a basic glass of sauvignon blanc.  the wine also turned out to be very acidic and not at all similar to the waiter's description.\n\nin terms of the food, we started with two appetizers.  a tiny mound of cool, fresh salmon tartare was immersed in a small bowl of fragrant miso oil and topped with a generous helping of salty caviar.  i am very picky about my tartare, judging it by the amount or lack of flavor it exudes.  this particular version was surprisingly well-seasoned and delicious.  we also sampled one of my favorites - the rock <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark> with spicy sauce.  the succulent fried balls of rock shrimp melted in our mouths, and the spicy mayo sauce <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> a creamy kick. \n\nmy friend stayed firm on our ordering sushi, so we requested the fusion-style <mark>House Special</mark> roll and the <mark>Spicy Scallop</mark> roll.  the <mark>Spicy Scallop</mark> one was pretty flavorful, but their house blend, which included several kinds of fish, had zero taste.  we actually sent it back and did not even bother to order a replacement.\n\nunfor<mark>Tuna (Big Eye)</mark>, i think this restaurant has lost its pizazz, and my friend was not impressed either.  i would really only recommend it for its non-sushi menu items, but even those are inconsistent.", 
            "i spent a week in las vegas at the hard rock hotel for nye this year. it was not my first visit to nobu, so we were very much looking forward to a meal there.\n\nas always, it was fantastic. the cucumber martini was so very refreshing i am still craving it. the yellow tail <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> has the best citrus soy sauce - we actually came back & got a drink & this dish again before we went out another night because it was so good & light. we also had the <mark>Lobster <mark>Tuna <mark>King Crab <mark>Vegetable <mark>Salmon Nobu Style Taco</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark> which were great.\n\nfor hot dishes, we had the rock <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark> <mark>King Crab with Amazu Ponzu</mark> sauce and the black cod <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark>. can you say melt in your mouth? this is the reason i return to nobu again & again.", 
            "ate at nobu in vegas last night and what an amazing experience we had.  we had the omakase experience, started with cold dishes to warm entree to heavy appetizer and finished off with a few of their special <mark>Dessert</mark>.  starters: <mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> sashimi with dried miso, olive oil and yuzu; <mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> and cilantro; <mark>Scallop</mark> and <mark>Black Cod Miso</mark> lettuce wraps; pink snapper with pineapple and tomatoes. for warm dishes: chilean sea bass <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> crust and <mark>Tenderloin of Beef</mark> braised <mark>Kumamoto Oyster with <mark>Bone in Ribeye 24oz Nobu Sauce</mark></mark> on a bed of south american yam; <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark> presented in 3 different sauces.  to finish off the meal, chelf sent a platter of 4 special <mark>Dessert</mark>.  always make room for dessert!!!", 
            "i was really hoping to like this place.  i know it's popular in la and have never been so we were walking by in the hard rock and looking for a place to have dinner and thought why not.  we were seated right away in the lounge area so that was good.  there were 3 of us dinng...our waitress didn't write anything down and i may have jinxed her when i asked if she was going to remember all of it because she forgot what my husband ordered.  she was friendly enough but service was slow.  they brought out all our food and it was pretty boring.  i ordered the <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark> hand roll and it wasn't rolled well and was basically just rice with a <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark> and a tiny bit of sauce.  i ordered albacore sushi and it was not that great...<mark>Albacore</mark> my favorite.  the salmon sashimi was okay.  i'd definitely say this place is overpriced for what you get.  after we were done eating, the waitress brought us another order of everything we had just eaten and said the kitchen messed up and we could have this food for free.  that was cool but since the food wasn't that great, we weren't too thrilled.  the tables in the lounge area are too short...my husband was too tall to sit at them so he sat on the booth side instead of the chairs...wierd.", 
            "oh nobu, you are definitely deserving of a 4 star review, but alas our server (name withheld) decided that serving us wasn't in his best interests.\n\nnow before i utilize yelp to complain about sub-par service i must document the highlights, because as we know, an amazing kitchen can make up for lacking service.\n\nthe <mark>Black Cod Miso</mark> was a life changer. you owe it to yourself to have this dish.\nalso the <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> was such a wonderful combination of flavors, that honestly, i can't find words to do it justice.\n\nnow as to why nobu earned 3 stars from me instead of 4. our service lacked in every area, inattentive, unwilling to suggest menu items for our group of 5, and at times seemingly spiteful. why did you bring us (2) rock <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark>? it's delicious don't get me wrong, but two? \n\nmaybe the malice was because 2 people in our group were very late, and he was missing out on those <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> tips, or because they couldn't include gratuity? i don't know. but when i'm spending $60-70 per person, i expect a little more.", 
            "!-!-!a-m-a-z-i-n-g-!-!-!\nok, so first off, i have never been a seafood fan, never mind sushi so this was my second time and it was amazing!!  everything you've heard about nobu is true!  i read the reviews and was down to try it when bf suggested it on our recent vegas trip.\nso we get there and are seated immediately, kudos.  i ordered the champagne 59 or some concoction and bf orders the mango martini-both are very yummay!!  but i think the mango was the better of the two!  \nso, me being a newbie on the sushi scene i was a bit intimidated by the menu and just jumped in and ordered the tuna tempura roll off the cold menu to start off with, really wasn't sure but it proved to be good!!! omg, even bf, who isn't really down <mark>Nobu Crispy Rice with Big Eye Tuna</mark>, was floored.  the tuna had scallions in the middle i believe....whatever it was delish!  and the sauce it had was soooo good, i don't even know what it was, i should've asked.  ok, shit was so good after we ordered the next 2 rolls, we ordered another order of the tuna tempura, and the tempura was so slight, it great crunch to the tiniest degree.\nnext, we ordered the <mark>Soft Shell Crab</mark> roll was again a mystery.  was a very welcome bite to my mouth, i don't know what else was in it but had a crunch also.  the crab was very good, not a hint of the seafoody about it! \nalso on our table was the <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark> roll, i know tempura is a no-no to the sushi elite, but training wheels here kids!  never mind that, this roll was a fave!  i also ordered another plate of this little roll because i loved it so much!  again, tiny bit of the tempura crunch=goodness!  the amazingness of this is too good to put into words......i again don't even know what was in it besides the skrimps but i honestly feel like going there again, like now.  \nso for dessert i ordered this thing described as apple brioche with caramel sauce that comes with a gelato.  it came out and looked like little donut holes!  was so good!  they were covered in sugar and inside was tiny chopped up apples and on the side in a little spoon was the carmel. little bites of <mark>Sweet Shrimp with Fried Head</mark>!  \nas for service-stellar! she was on it when we needed drinks and more sushi, but she kinda lacked when i asked about rolls.  that's ok, i walked out very happy!", 
            "one of my favorite restaurants! las vegas is as great as nyc. decor is amazing and food even better. i had <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> and cilantro cold appetizer. this is my favorite! rock <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark> with butter ponzu hot appetizer....awesome!  soft-<mark>Soft Shell Crab</mark> and <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> and a salmon roll, traditional and fabulous!",

            "went here on valentine's day for a company function and i am going to say--hands down--the best japanese food/sushi in my entire life! none of the dishes disappointed me and i couldn't wait for each dish to come out as they got better and better as the meal went on. \n\nsupposedly the owner of the company that took us here is a big deal so we got excellent service. the waiters and the chef knew who he was so we got taken care of. i went to show someone where our table was (literally not even a minute) and my napkin was refolded at my seat. \n\nthis is what we had:\n\n-edamame\n-<mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark>\n-rock <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark> with cream spicy sauce\n-rock <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark> with butter ponzu\n-<mark>Black Cod Miso</mark>\n-chilean sea bass with dried miso\n-beef tenderloin (medium rare) in a claypot\n-<mark>Mushroom Soup</mark>\n-pickled sushi platter  \n-sushi platter\n-ceviche with mixed seafood (and quail egg)\n-fish egg sushi with quail egg\n-sweet potato and avocado tempura\n-dessert: chef's tasting platter\n\nalcohol: i had a mango martini--delicious! i don't really like to taste alcohol, but this was a good sweet/tart drink that got me slightly buzzed. good tasting + getting buzzed = winner!\n\nsome highlights of the meal: \n-the seafood was amazingly fresh and it was the best quality i've had. my top favorite was the <mark>Black Cod Miso</mark> and the chilean sea bass. melt in your mouth heaven. \n-beef tenderloin was perfection--i love my meats medium rare and it was good and bloody. \n-i did a shot of the ceviche with a raw quail egg and it was great. you only live once, and if you want to try something might as well do it at nobu since they know how to prepare it properly. bottoms up!\n\ni'm so glad i went with a company because there is no way i would have been able to 1. afford all of this food and 2. to order this many plates. nobu is great and i would gladly go back if i had the chance!", 
            "went for the first time.  \n\nhot food: tried the sea bass w/ miso sauce, teriyaki tasmanian sea trout skewers (very similar to salmon), <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark>.  all very very good, especially the bass and trout. \n\nsushi: fish was the freshest around.  however, i was very disappointed with the lack <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark>.  i asked my sushi chef for anything unique that they do with their sushi.  got a blank stare.  i'm used to the unrelated and not-so-famous nobu's in solana beach, ca where creativity is more common than not, and what a difference it makes.  \n\nservice was incredible.  it felt as if they are standing behind you waiting for your every need.  i suppose you have to order off the specials if you want something creative (non-sushi), but you'll be paying a premium $30 to $75+ per plate.\n\nshould be a 4 to 4.5 star, but since i had high expectations that weren't met, i'm docking my rating by a point.",

            "expect to spend some money if you go here. don't be cheap! nobu is a great place to go for a special occasion or... if you just have..... a lot of money. the sushi is definitely fresh and the warm dishes are absolutely delicious! the inside is clean, nice and has modern decor. the sushi bar is quite large and there's also a bar and lounge in the front. the spicy <mark>Big Eye Tuna Roll</mark> is different from any other place that i've tried. it does not have the minced up tuna but instead a nice, thick slice of tuna with a spicy, scallion sauce. also, the rolls have the rice on the inside not on the outside, like you find at most places now a days. the rolls are small, so they fit right into your mouth with one bite. some things that i recommend are the <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark>... it is to die for. the yellowtail is fresh and the jalapeno pepper gives it a little kick. the <mark>Black Cod Miso</mark> is absolutely delicious, it melts in your mouth. the rock <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark> is really good as well. they also have new cocktails every month, so ask your server or the bartender what the special cocktails are. the lychee martini is really good!\n\nnobu is also a great place to spot celebrities. if you dine here you'll most likely see at least one celebrity. it's a hot spot.\n\ntry nobu and you won't be disappointed but i have to say again, don't be cheap!!! enjoy the ambiance and the great food.",

            "just got back from another great vegas weekend. though i have been to nobu here many times, i have never given them a review. long overdue. the good news is that with the opening of the \"new\" place at ceasars, the hard rock location is very easy to get a table now (hope they stay here ;) )\nthe service is always top notch. the food still retains a very high quality. my favs did not dissapoint, the spicy rock <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark>, the <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> and the <mark>Black Cod Miso</mark> cod were perfection. can't wait for my next vegas trip!", 
            "this is the only restaurant that i would recommend at the hard rock hotel. i was working at the hrh for five days and ended up eating at almost every establishment there. nobu is the only one that i would optionally go to again.\n\nthis is the best sushi i've had. everything was flavorful and top quality. i can't remember all the dishes i had, but below are the ones i can remember (score out of 5):\n\n-bug <mark>Nobu Crispy Rice with Big Eye Tuna</mark> lotus chips 4\n-<mark>Shishito Peppers</mark> 2 (i got a really spicy one!)\n-<mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> 4\n-rock <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark> with creamy spicy sauce 4 (butter ponzu sauce 3)\n-rice cubes <mark>Nobu Crispy Rice with Big Eye Tuna</mark> spread 3\n-sushi roll with 4 types of fish 5\n-<mark>Black Cod Miso</mark> 10 you must get this, it is sooooo good!\n-horchata flan 3\n\ni would go just for the <mark>Black Cod Miso</mark>!\n\nthe food is great, but the service was lacking. when we sat down we were a group of 5 and a 6th person joined us. when the waiter brought the tuna lotus chips out he said there are only 5 since that's how many you were when you sat down. he easily could have said i'll bring you another, but i had to specifically ask him. for the price, service should be better, maybe because it's still in the hard rock.", 
            "perfection. i love sushi and have been to several nobu restaurants (both new york locations, san diego, bahamas, los angeles) and this place is my favorite. i've been to this nobu over 10 times and look forward to returning. \n\nthe food at any nobu is consistently out of this world but what makes this location my favorite is the staff. not only can each staff member be a model but everyone on staff is attentive, efficient, and interesting. \n\nthings to order:\n- yellowtail jalepeno sashimi\n- butter lettuce cod\n- <mark>White Fish <mark>Scallop <mark>Salmon <mark>Oyster <mark>Beef <mark>Yuba Sashimi New Style</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark> toro sashimi\n- negi toro hand roll \n- kobe sashimi with hot rocks\n- rock <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark>\n- <mark>Soft Shell Crab</mark> special \n- <mark>Artichoke Salad</mark> (without noodles)\n- yk35 sake\n- peach bellini\n- japanese whiskey flight \n- coconut-lime sake\n- <mark>Bento Box</mark>\n\nlast time we were in we had andrew as our server. super great guy. he gave us some excellent recommendations and was very friendly and professional. i'm going to request to sit in andrew's section every time i go back. \n\nof course i wish nobu wasn't so expensive but i still think it's well worth every penny.", 
            "so- we utilized a tasting menu purchase from groupon, and my biggest fear was that it was not going to be enough food...far from it! the dishes are all good-sized portions (frankly, more food than myself and my boyfriend would normally eat) and everything was delicious! some, more than others- the actual sushi roll was a little forgettable, but the following were amazing: yellowtail sashimi with jalape\\u00f1o, rock <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark> with creamy spicy sauce, black cod <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark>. also, the desert was delicious. \n\ni would recommend, however pricing is not for the faint of heart. it is pricey- but, i think anyone attending this establishment should know that.", 
            "this is a review of the groupon deal dinner.\n\nthe skinny: fusion peruvian japanese dishes left me unimpressed (3) service: excellent service despite the disappointing cuisine (5) value: for the groupon, it is still overpriced for what it is. so you can imagine what i have to say about full price ... not worth it (2.5).\n\nso here's the deal. we spotted the nobu groupon for $95/2 person (regularly $150) prix fixe menu and we thought \"how can we pass this up?\".\n\nwe went and were seated prompty. our server was great at giving us time and space to make some decisions on the menu. we ended up getting in <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> to the prix fixe an order of their <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark> to round out the menu. the specials that they offered didn't really appeal - there was a lot of fruit/candied nuts mixed in with sashimi which sounded overly sweet to me so i passed on those.\n\nstarting <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> simple edamame with maldon sea salt (love those flakes!), it was a nice way to start a meal.\n\ncourse 1) <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark>/cilantro (6 slices): this was a good dish but not exceptional. although i have had different versions of this before, this is one of the better renditions given the quality of the fish and the strategically correct amount of heat. my only thing with this dish was the actual slices of sashimi itself - the slices were a bit thin and ragged along the edges which surprised me given the supposed caliber of this place.\n\ncourse 2) selection of nigri (6 pcs) and a california roll (6 pcs): the nigri was okay - the slices of fish were decent sized. i was despondent when i realized that the sushi rice was a little too overcooked and sticky.\n\ncourse 3) rock <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark>: the first bite was good however as we ate, the spicy aioli began to slowly permeate the batter leading to a soggier batter. i think it aioli would have been better served as a dipping sauce rather than dressed on the tempura to retain textural integrity. flavorwise, this was a nice dish and we loved the mixture of chive and togarashi.\n\ncourse 4) miso glazed black cod: candied black cod more like it! overly sweet, the piece of fish was smothered in the sugary sauce which became more unappetizing the more we worked to finish this. i have made this at home using his recipe with 1/2 the sugar and it is much better.\n\ncourse 5) <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark> (<mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> to the groupon): the tempura was okay nothing special. the batter was slightly spongier than what i like. i think it would have been better if the shredded daikon/ginger was provided to us so we could <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> much/little we wanted.\n\ncourse 6) normally this would be <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark> except it was my birthday so i got a molten cake with a tiramisu and green tea <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark>. all of them were very good however there was nothing that really wow'ed me to think that it was exceptional.\n\nperhaps 10 years ago, the level of this fusion cuisine would be considered cutting edge. however time has made his dishes appear quite dated. the signature dishes of rock <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark>/yellowtail jalape\\u00f1o sashimi/miso glazed black cod are easily found elsewhere - one might argue that this location's rendition is rather lackluster considering the price. given the many issues with the dishes mentioned above, i cannot recommend this place given the groupon price let alone full price. although our server was truly exceptional, that doesn't make up for the food. 2.5 rounded up to 3 starred review.", 
            "the absolute best experience ever. had the groupon - filled us up completely and blew our minds with every dish. the service is outstanding and we were in and out in an hour. had edamame to start - a good primer. then yellowtail sashimi with jalape\\u00f1os and a special soy sauce - oh my goodness my favorite dish. i don't even like sashimi. then a huge california roll and tons of nigri - best i've ever had. then this crazy <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark> with the greatest sauce ever over a bed of lettuce with my best - tasting dressing that complimented it so well - like fireworks in your mouth. very filling. then this fish. alaskan cod. i thought there was a party in my mouth - cooked absolutely perfectly it melted in your mouth and left you feeling completely satisfied. dessert was insane. you just have to experience it.", 
            "my sister and i planned out our trip to vegas to include a dinner at nobu. maybe my tastes are horrible and i'm missing out on some great dishes, but i found our dining experience to be a-ok.\n\nthe service was great; the staff is very knowledgeable about the menu. of course, the prices are up there--not complaining about that part. but in all honesty, i really didn't taste a different in the quality of fish used in my sushi compared to the less than $10 rolls i eat here in az. same goes with the rock <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark> in creamy spicy sauce. at least i can say i've tried it.",

            "impromptu trip to vegas for my best friend's birthday! yay! while planning our trip, i noticed a groupon for nobu. i'd been wanting to try out one of the la locations for a while, so this seemed like a win-win. overall, the experience was pretty great. the service was friendly and very attentive (almost too attentive... my ice tea cup was never empty. i don't think they even let it get half empty...)\n\nthe meal started with edamame which wasn't anything special. standard at any japanese place you'd go to. the first course was the yellowtail sashimi with jalepeno. this was so good!! i'm normally not a jalepeno fan, but it had just the right amount of kick to it. this was definitely my favorite dish of the night.\n\nnext up was the rock <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark>. this was alright. i liked the sauce with the lettuce/salad below, but it was too heavy for the shrimp... my friend and i agreed that it just left us craving honey walnut shrimp from panda express. \n\nthird entree up was the <mark>Black Cod Miso</mark>. this was also an outstanding dish, like the yellowtail. the fish was cooked perfectly and the entire dish was both presented well and tasted great. \n\nthe fourth entree (and the reason for docking one star) was california roll and assorted nigiri. maybe it's just because i live in la and i'm spoiled by great sushi, but i wasn't impressed. the fish was fresh enough, but definitely not up to par to say, sugarfish. and at the heart of it all, nobu is a japanese restaurant, so i expected their sushi to be on par with their fusion dishes. sadly, not the case.\n\nthe meal ended with the <mark>Bento Box</mark> dessert, which had flour-less chocolate cake, green tea <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark> <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> cappuccino thing. i'm not a huge dessert person but it was ok. i've never disliked any green tea <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark> i've had and the cappuccino thing was unique. \n\noverall, it was a great meal and good experience. without a doubt, it was worth the price of the groupon. not sure about full price though. i think only the yellowtail sashimi and <mark>Black Cod Miso</mark> would be worth it.", 
            "i had wanted to try nobu for some time, having heard many good things about it. when i saw the $99 groupon plus the 20% off groupon was offering plus my wife's b'day to celebrate there, i knew the stars were aligned.  could it live up to reputation?\nthe food: the groupon is for a 5 course tasting menu. the meal starts with a pass out of edamame with maldon salt. a very generous portion and an excellent way to start a meal. the first course was yellowtail tuna <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> and cilantro. the tuna was sliced super thin and was in a citrus sauce. it was very tasty and different than yellowtail that i have eaten at my local sushi restaurant. things got even better after that. the next dish was rock <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark> with a creamy spicy sauce. wow, was that good! not like any tempura i have eaten before. very lightly breaded, cooked so the shrimp were soft but not mushy. and the spicy sauce was easily handled even by my gringo palate. a great dish. and a huge portion. by its size, the dish would have been enough for dinner if it was the only thing served. this was followed by the alaskan black cod <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark>. another outstanding dish. the fourth course was the sushi; tuna, fluke and salmon with a california roll. this was the weakest part of the menu - only very good. last course, dessert. i photographed the plate. a beautiful presentation with very tasty treats (and a hand written birthday greeting in chocolate). the food rates 5 stars plus.\nthe service: as soon as we were seated, our server, albert, came by to greet us, explain the tasting menu, and take our drink orders. throughout the meal, he, the busboy, and the food runner were very attentive without being overbearing. they made us feel very welcome. our water glasses were never allowed to go below half full. the table was cleared promptly. the food came out of the kitchen plated beautifully. the service was 5 stars plus.\nthe ambiance: the restaurant is nicely decorated with lots of bamboo. however, the tables for 2 were placed one on top of the other. we were there on a monday night, so the tables were never more than 1/3 full.  but our table was about 6 inches from the next table, which was 6 inches from the next in a line up of 4 tables. if the restaurant were crowded and there were people at the next table, we would have been eating with strangers. not my idea of a celebration/romantic meal. at best, 3 stars for ambiance.\nvalue: $80 for dinner of this quality is the deal of the decade. i would do it again in a heartbeat. but i would never go on a weekend night when the table next to me might be occupied (or i would go with a party of 6 or more - the bigger tables were nicely spaced out).", 
            "there's a groupon for nobu?!! whaaaat!?! yes, believe it! i had purchased a groupon for a 5 course tasting menu for $80 for 2 people. and my bf was super excited because he has been wanting to try this place for a while now. it was actually perfect timing that this groupon became available because i was going to be in vegas this weekend. *woot woot!* anyways, i made reservations for 2 at 6pm online and got an e-mail confirmation right away. the groupon can only be used at the nobu inside the hard rock hotel. there's also a nobu inside caeser's palace. once we checked in with the hostesses, we were immediately seated at a nice comfy table and were greeted with a big welcome in japanese! the decor inside was really nice and elegant. i really liked the bamboo wall they had. i also thought it was really cute that we each had a rock on our table used as a chopstick holder. \n\nok onto the food! so we started off <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> edamame with sea salt, which was nothing too special but was good. next came the best sashimi i had ever had in my life! its yellowtail sashimi with a jalapeno slice on top dressed in almost like a ponzu sauce. the flavors went really well together and the yellowtail was fresh and spicy. yumm!!! i can probably eat like five more of that dish. :p the next dish was also another one of their popular dishes: the <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark>. i was really surprised that the shrimp didn't look at all like the usual tempura found at japanese restaurants. the dish almost looked like honey walnut shrimp actually but tasted ten times better. it was rich and creamy. and the sauce it was covered in was deliscious. next came their black cod dish. my bf absolutely loved this one and i can see why. it was so flakey and cooked to perfection. the fish melted in our mouths like butter and it was sweet and savory. next came a plate of sushi, which consisted of a califonia roll and 6 pieces of sashimi sushi. this dish was nothing too fancy and didn't stand out too much. but it was still tasty. and lastly we got our dessert! it was such a cute looking dessert, which composed of a green tea ice-cream, a flourless chocolate cake, and a cuppacino cup. omg...so good!!! the green tea ice-cream is made in house and  after one bite and you definetely know it's green tea ice-cream. the cuppacino cup was probably my favorite out of the other 2 <mark>Dessert</mark> because it was so beautifully crafted and tasted heavenly. the chocolate cake was very fluffy and not too sweet. overall, everything we tried was excellent! the reason why i subtracted 1 star was because both my bf and i felt that the cod and the shrimp was slightly on the saltier side and all of the dishes are pretty small plates to share between 2 people. otherwise, customer service here was superb and our server was just so friendly and informative on the dishes we were trying. i'm so happy to get to try nobu for the first time! =) so go get your groupon, while it's still available peeps!!", 
            "absolutely terrific!  food is always consistent and service is terrific. if there is one knock, it's the atmosphere. tables are a bit squished together and narrow for 2. signature dishes jalape\\u00f1o yellowtail, miso salmon <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark> shrimp are musts!", 
            "impeccable comes to mind when i look back at dinner last night. just wow! \nwe started with <mark>Shishito Peppers</mark> and an amazing tuna <mark><mark>Nobu's Moriawase Sashimi Salad</mark></mark>, moved on to a squid and vegetable dish/casserole that was out of this world followed by miso blackened cod that was absolutely mouth watering.  then came some of the best sushi! yellowtail with scallion roll, yellowtail with jalape\\u00f1o roll, <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark> roll. the wine was a lovely napa chardonnay. \nthe ambiance of this restaurant is calming and the service is excellent! \njapanese restaurants are plentiful in this town so an outstanding stand out restaurant in this category means a lot: this restaurant is outstanding and stands on its own!\nthe prices are very reasonable. not at all overpriced. highly recommended. i am definitely going back!"

            "nobu would have gotten the 5th star, except for the loud music, and the decidedly non-intimate seating. my wife and i aren't opposed to answering a question about a dish, but when the folks next to you can lean over and check out what you're eating, well...i understand that that's the place's image, but it just keeps it from being a 5-star dining experience, imo.\n\nwe went on a sunday night at 7:30p. we were seated immediately, and our server brought the drink menus. my wife had the passion mojito, and i stuck with a sapporo because i'm not a huge fan of sake. the drink menu was replaced with the dinner menu, but we were pretty sure we were going to have the omakase.\n\nthere are two basic \"levels\" of omakase...each is composed of a mixture of cold dishes, hot dishes, sushi, and dessert. the lower-priced version ($100) contains more traditional dishes, and the higher priced version ($135) was said to be more \"exotic\". we both opted for the latter. i was trying to listen to the explanation of each dish and then scribble them down, so i likely missed some of the little accompaniments/garnishes. \n\n- kumamoto oyster, on the half-shell, with nobu salsa\n- sweet shrimp (sashimi-style, no rice, and no tempura head)\n- some kind of shellfish sashimi-style (either scallop or clam, i'm leaning towards scallop, based on the texture and the menu offerings)\nall three of these items were served on the same plate, the latter two with, i think, ponzu sauce. the oyster was pretty large, such that i didn't want to pick the shell up and end up wearing some of it. the sweet shrimp was very rich and quite tasty, and what i'm assuming was the scallop was a little firmer than i would expect, but still very good.\n\n- kampachi sashimi with kelp and mushroom \nkampachi is one of my favorite fish, and this did not disappoint. the kelp and mushroom, i think, were kept subtle so as not to overpower the fish...you could actually skip the kelp and mushrooms if you were trying to save room for later. \n\n- new-style unagi (lightly seared) layered with shiitake over a bed of tofu, with uni on the side\nthey have a really good sauce for the uni, because i don't like uni, and this tasted great! :) the unagi was also wonderful when prepared like this, as the meat is very tender, and no powerful marinade.\n\n- toro salad with vegetable spring roll\ni wasn't crazy about the spring roll...i thought it was bland. the toro salad, however, was very good.\n\n- green tea & ume sorbet\ni guess this was a palate cleanser? i wasn't expecting to get something like this in the middle of the meal. after the server brought it out, i told my wife, \"thank you for dining at nobu, please come back soon.\" anyway, it was not overly sweet, and would be fine as a dessert after a big meal.\n\n- broiled snapper over risotto with <mark>Snow Crab</mark> meat, topped with a white truffle chip \nthe hot dishes started with a small chunk of snapper that was done pretty much perfectly, no color, but still very juicy. the risotto was ok, nothing special, but the rice went well with the fish.\n\n- small, sliced, grilled \"kobe\" beef tenderloin with okinawa potatoes served alongside a slice of grilled japanese eggplant topped with a small piece of grilled <mark>Teppan Style Foie Gras</mark>.\ni'm going to commit heresy in a bit...i put kobe in quotes, because i hear a bunch of stories about whether or not kobe is kobe, but this tenderloin was done rare, and the potatoes went nicely with it. great dish. i don't really like eggplant, but this was ok, so they did something right. i'd never had <mark>Teppan Style Foie Gras</mark> before, and, well, meh? there, i said it.\n\n- <mark><mark>Lobster <mark>Miso Soup</mark></mark></mark> with clam\nanother break, like the sorbet. it wasn't bad or anything, but i was getting kinda full, so i almost skipped it. (almost).\n\n- nigiri sampler: oh toro, pink snapper, sardine, <mark>Snow Crab</mark>, <mark>Jumbo Clam</mark>\nthe clam was fresh and crunchy, but the <mark>Snow Crab</mark> was pretty ordinary. this was only the second time i've had sardine nigiri. i like sardine under other circumstances, but for sushi, i think it's just too oily? i couldn't tell the difference between the pink snapper and, say, fresh tai, but it was very firm and tasty. my wife told me the oh toro was awful and that i should consider letting her eat it for me, as she didn't want it to ruin my dinner. i love her very much, but in matters of sushi, she is not to be trusted. :) try the oh toro.\n\n- blancmange (yogurt, in this case) over almond crisp, pomegranate seeds, and assorted frozen berries.\nfull. i almost had to pass on dessert (almost). again, not overly sweet, which is a plus in my book, and the berries and almond crisp combined very well. \n\nthe service was tremendous, as the restaurant has a large waitstaff, so dishes are cleared away promptly, but we were not rushed. our section filled up towards the latter half of the meal, but the staff were able to keep up with no problems.\n\nif you're a fan of this type of japanese food, check it out - it's pricey, but you're in vegas, so live a little!", 
            "when nobu opened in new york city, it created a sensation.  reservations were nearly impossible to get, and its new interpretation of traditional japanese food was widely praised.  this led to the inevitable branding of the restaurant; nobu can be found all over the globe.\n\nmeal #1: i found las vegas nobu's sushi highly variable.  the overall quality was ok, but some items (e.g., uni) were poor while others (e.g., ankimo) were good.  orange and honey flavored sake was interesting but probably not worth repeating.\n\n\nmeal #2:  since my first meal, i went to nobu in miami beach, sat in the dining room and had the omakase meal.  i enjoyed that a bit more, so decided to give the vegas location another shot.\n\nthe restaurant looks ok, but nothing great.  it's very noisy, in keeping with the hard rock atmosphere.  the crowd is mostly young, but i think anyone would feel comfortable here; i did.  service is pleasant, although all the servers are running around at full speed.\n\nnow, on to the meal:\n\n    * i chose jyunmai daiginjyo sake.  it wasn't bad, but was a trifle harsh.\n    * small japanese spring roll with balsamic vinaigrette reduction.  good.\n    * trio of raw seafood: sea scallop slice, oyster, ama ebi (raw shrimp).  all served with onion and other spices, although each was slightly different.  good.\n    * seared maguro and a slightly strong flavored fish, <mark>Squid 'Pasta' with Light Garlic</mark> chips and a pickled ginger shoot.  a good combination.  very good.\n    * uni (<mark>Sea Urchin</mark>) <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> white fish, served on sliced eggplant.  the uni was seared and was surprisingly delicious.  there was also a tiny river crab, to be eaten shell and all; interesting for the crunch, not the flavor.  very good.\n    * o toro and a spring roll <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> sauce and radish.  the o toro was good but a little chewy, and the strong sauce tended to overwhelm the tuna.  good to very good.\n    * palate cleanser: intensely flavored, sweet/sour mango sorbet, on top of a red granite with little flavor.\n    * service lapse.  up to this point, courses had been timed well.  at this point, i waited for about 15 minutes, with no explanation.  this was a little annoying.\n    * grilled sea scallop on a bed of mushrooms, bits of seafood, and brown rice.  very good.\n    * <mark>Teppan Style Foie Gras</mark> and kobe beef.  a large hunk of <mark>Teppan Style Foie Gras</mark>; good flavor.  kobe beef very good.  overall, very good to excellent.\n    * service lapse: the next course was supposed to be sushi, followed by <mark><mark>Lobster <mark>Miso Soup</mark></mark></mark>.  they reversed the order, and apologized later.  a minor matter.\n    * <mark><mark>Lobster <mark>Miso Soup</mark></mark></mark>.  better than average; good fish stock flavor, not too salty.  very good.\n    * sushi: o-toro (tuna belly), <mark>Shima Aji</mark> (variety of mackerel?), some kind of crab, unagi (eel).  very good.\n    * fruit papillote.  like a crepe.  the raspberry seeds were very distracting.  fair.\n    * honey <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark>.  very strong honey flavor.  strange, but i liked it.  very good.\n\noverall, the meal was good, but not as good as nobu in miami, and not nearly as good as okada.  at the price they charge ($120), they need to do better.\n\n\nmeal #3: based on past meals, i hadn't planned to return. however, i found myself at the hard rock hotel at meal time, and no other choices looked appealing. i decided to go for unusual choices, hoping this would be a strength. this worked out better. my selections:\n\n    * ankimo (steamed monkfish liver). standard but still very good.\n    * <mark>Hamachi Kama</mark> (grilled yellowtail collar). this is a chunk of fish, skin and bone, served grilled. it may not sound like much, and it's a little difficult to get the flesh out, but it's usually very rich and very tasty. i was both happy and sad with my choice: it was very good, but not as good as elsewhere. if you'd like to try this dish, order it robatayaki style at okada.\n    * live shrimp. these santa barbara shrimp were killed in front of me, so i guess that means they're fresh. they were big and rather chewy; i'm guessing the latter is due to their recent demise. the heads were served tempura style, and were juicy and tasty.\n    * live octopus. i'm not sure that it was live, but slices of the tentacle, served raw, were indeed very fresh tasting - and much less chewy than the cooked version. pretty good.\n\nthis was the most satisfying of my meals at nobu. nothing was stellar, but everything was good.\n\n\n\nnobu's strength is its new take on japanese foods.  its weaknesses are sushi that isn't in the same class with the better places in las vegas, and suspect service.  given such high prices, i'd look elsewhere.", 
            "as an avid sushi chick ... i was looking forward to chef matsushita to wow me. \n\nthe place was expectedly pretty ... the $14 cucumber martini (lame). \nignorable since i came here to be \"wow\"ed by the food not the booze. the waitress was really really really sweet and the couple sitting next to us shared their sake with us ... which was sweet. \nwe were debating between sticking to rolls and your average japanese food or the chef's specialty.\n\n$100 for the omakase ... an extra $35 for \"better quality food\".  *ding*\n\n1. gazpacho w/ a white asparagus eggroll. gazpacho = ok. eggroll = interesting. a lame start for a meal i was expecting to be great. \n\n2. bonito, some other weird fish and a japanese fish i can't remember \"sashimi\" = interesting. the salsa made the dish. it was ok. \n\n3. <mark><mark>Nobu's Moriawase Sashimi Salad</mark></mark> w/ sake and peppers and onions = ok. i was still waiting to be wowed at this point ... then again ... this was just the start ... a small build up to what's going to be great... right??!\n\n4. peppered sea bass w/ truffle sauce = ... the highlight of the meal. some parts had some serious pepper ... but it was good. \n\n5. kobe beef <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> sort of lame tabasco = the beef was good. the tabasco ... lame.\n\n*insert some weird apple sauce shot w/ a mandarin orange* \n\n*this is where it gets bad*\n\n6. soup. how do you mess up <mark><mark>Lobster <mark>Miso Soup</mark></mark></mark>? ... put an unfresh clam in it with serious sand in it. \n\n7. sushi. eel / half raw supposedly cooked but still slimy shrimp / ? / ? = i had never gagged and vomitted into my napkin until this very moment in time. i choked on an eel bone and the skin of the eel still had scales. the eel itself was sour. the rest of the fish was disguised with the not optional wasabi ball that was lodged into the rice ball. ... and of course more tabasco. \n\n... *insert bathroom runs 3x*\n\n8. green tea weird thing with pineapple foam = good.\n\ni was not at all impressed. i left sick and wanting the meal to end as soon as possible... i didn't even finish my cocktail. :(\n\n... i should have stuck to the rolls.", 
            "i've heard various friends praise los angeles's nobu over the years, so after my girlfriend ran the las vegas marathon this weekend, we decided to celebrate <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> first-class sushi.\n\nwe had reservations at 9:00 pm, and we were seated promptly (actually ahead of time, which was nice). my first impression of the restaurant was that it was extremely loud (we were there on a tuesday night), and its location in the hard rock hotel made me groan (it's a bit out of the way, and not necessarily a place i want to poke around).\n\nour waiter, justin, was initially very prompt with our drink orders, but it took 10 minutes (and a reminder) to get glasses of water, and another 10 to get <mark><mark>Lobster <mark>Miso Soup</mark></mark></mark>.\n\nour first course was only half right (we got two dishes, but one was not what we ordered). the servers apologized and took it away. at the rate they were bringing out our food, though, we shuddered to think how long it would take them to bring out the correct dish. for<mark>Tuna (Big Eye)</mark>, it was corrected quickly.\n\nwhen our sushi came out, we noticed another mistake: the <mark>Spicy Miso Chips <mark>Nobu Crispy Rice with Big Eye Tuna</mark> or <mark>Scallop</mark></mark> had been mistakenly replaced with a second order of <mark>Spicy Tuna (Big Eye)</mark>. again, we told them it was wrong and again, they corrected the mistake rather quickly.\n\nservice got to be so bad that after asking a server to hail our waiter (and subsequently having the request ignored), we decided to get the manager over to our table. we were 30 seconds from getting up and leaving (she took another 5 minutes to get to the table) when she came over and heard our story. she seemed as interested in our plight as any manager should and agreed to comp some of our dishes, which was nice.\n\nstill, however, justin's service through the entire night was abysmal (i think we saw him 3 times over an hour and a half), and no amount of manager treatment could save the tip.\n\nregarding the food, it was ok. the <mark><mark>Lobster <mark>Miso Soup</mark></mark></mark> was great. the <mark>Spicy Tuna (Big Eye)</mark> and scallop rolls were anything but (very mild), and the hot/cold mixture of the tuna tempura rolls was a little strange. it was good, but the temperature difference was one of those things that made me wonder, \"is this supposed to be this way and i'm an idiot for thinking this, or is something actually wrong with how it was made?\" judging by the fact that the tuna tempura rolls were one of the dishes they got wrong initially, it could have been that they rushed the order and made it worse. either way, i wasn't really in love with it.\n\nfor the price i [would have] paid, i can't say that the las vegas nobu is really worth it for me again. i've had much better sushi in oakland, for much less.", 
            "nobu is my favorite japanese restaurant.  ever.  so far i've been to three- this one, nobu malibu and nobu 57 in ny.  out of the three, i'd have to say ny was the best and this one the least-best.  i say \"least best\" because \"worst\" and nobu don't belong in the same sentence together.  you cant go wrong with nobu- but i did have a few gripes about my most recent experience here a couple days ago.\n\nso, of course of course you have to get the miso cod, obvie...not going to spend time describing how fabulous that dish is. in <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> to the cod, i also ordered the lychee martini, the miso eggplant, the <mark>Hearts of Palm</mark> salad with \"jalapeno\" dressing and a <mark><mark>Lobster <mark>Miso Soup</mark></mark></mark>.  if you've read my nobu 57 review, you can see that the lychee martini i had was perfect (which is why i had 3), so understandably i was excited to have it again.  however, the one i received at nobu vegas was waaaaay to strong, and i had to request <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> lychee juice to balance out the rubbing alcohol taste.  my other major gripe was the <mark>Hearts of Palm</mark> salad.  i specifically went out of my way to ask the server if this salad was the same <mark>Hearts of Palm</mark> salad <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> dressing they serve at nobu 57, and he assured me it was.  wrong.  that salad that came out was repulsive- and pretty offensive because of the over-the-top garlic used.  it tasted nothing like the marvelous h.o.p. salad at nobu 57.  and, they should call it \"blast of garlic dressing\" because after one bite i swear i smelled wretchedly of garlic for the rest of the night- and it wasn't spicy from the jalapeno at all.  oh, and not to mention the fact that it was twenty dollars.  um, yea...skip that one.  the miso eggplant was good- not remarkable, but we did eat every last bit of it.\n\nso, even with my complaints i still believe its a 4-star worthy establishment because every one of my previous experiences here have been amazing.  maybe not as good as nobu 57, but still the best japanese restaraunt in vegas, definitely.", 
            "very very good. hard to say that it lived up to the hype, but i thought the omakase was good value for $100. i went with my parents and they also ordered the omakase. the waiter tempted us with the $150 omakase containing \"dishes not on the menu\", but being our first time at nobu, we went with the cheaper omakase. the dishes (as best as i can remember from my pics), in order: (cold-hot-sushi-soup-dessert)\n\n1) toro with spicy miso and caviar - wow, definitely one of the highlights of the omakase. super juicy, melt-in-your-mouth toro topped with a bit of caviar and sitting in a nice spicy miso sauce. omg so good. there was an interesting tiny japanese peach on the side to cleanse the palate.\n\n2) hawaiian <mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> sashimi - very nice texture and mix of flavors with the a citrus sauce, spot of spicy sauce, a sprinkle of black sea salt, and . not sure if it's on the regular menu, maybe it's called something else.\n\n3) kampachi and <mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> sashimi - super exotic and tasty. i didn't even know what kampachi was until i looked it up. apparently it's hawaiian yellowtail farmed in the open ocean off the kona coast of the big island. the trout was also very good. it looks a bit like salmon, but tastes a lot better. served with a nice miso-based sauce (i think) on the side, a couple small veggie sushi rolls, a roasted jalapeno, and a small, yellow, pear-shaped tomato sliced in half.\n\n4) black cod w/ miso - this dish really did live up to the hype. i was about to order it separately in case it did not come with the omakase, but our waiter said it is normally included in the $100 omakase since it's a very popular dish. omg so good. such delicate flavors and texture. amazing. i normally don't like to eat fish skin, but this skin is super good and flavorful. the cod is very light and flaky, but not dry. wow, this is a must try if you come to nobu.\n\n5) beef tenderloin w/ shiitake mushroom <mark>Tuna (Big Eye) and Asparagus</mark> - i didn't think this was that special and probably would not order off the regular menu. it was very good tenderloin though, cooked to a perfect medium rare, with a light sauce. it is served in a sizzling mini cast iron plate.\n\n6) nigiri sushi platter - delicious nigiri, super fresh, and most pieces i normally wouldn't order myself, but were interesting to try. tuna (best i've had in awhile), <mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark>, aji, giant clam, and sweet shrimp. mmm\n\n7) <mark><mark>Lobster <mark>Miso Soup</mark></mark></mark> w/ clams - pretty standard <mark><mark>Lobster <mark>Miso Soup</mark></mark></mark> with a few clams inside. the clams and miso is a good combination, but they can be tricky to fish out and eat with only chopsticks. i cheated on one of them and used two fingers to hold the shell. ;p\n\n8) flourless chocolate cake w/ green tea <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark> - a generous portion served in a cute <mark>Bento Box</mark>. nothing too spectacular or interesting, but delicious nonetheless. the cake was still nice and molten inside when it arrived. yum!\n\na pretty filling flight of dishes for $100. i thought it was good value to try many dishes, but i haven't seen the sizes of the normal dishes. many tables around us also ordered the omakase, as i heard the same descriptions being recited by the staff over and over. i over heard a table of french tourists behind us ordering california rolls, chicken teriyaki, tempura, and other generic stuff you can get anywhere. sigh, what a waste.\n\ni would recommend not to order anything not on the \"hot\" of \"cold\" specialty pages of the menu. the rest is basically traditional japanese fare you can get anywhere, but will probably taste better and cost a lot more at nobu. service was good, polite, and attentive. it was a bit odd when our waiter brought out the first few dishes, and then a couple other different guys brought out some of the following ones. weird.\n\nthe decor is basic, but nothing too special. the sushi bar looks cool and there's a pretty wall of bamboo poles at the back as you walk in. my parents like to eat early, so we moved our reservation to 6pm when they are supposed to open. when we arrived a few minutes early, the door was locked and they didn't seem ready yet. ten minutes later, they were ready. better to come early though, or your omakase may take two hours or longer to get through. ours took about 90 minutes because it wasn't that crowded until after 7.\n\ni think the tenderloin and dessert could have been better and more creative. otherwise, nearly flawless.\n\nif i ever return for a special occasion, i will definitely need to try the $150 omakase. with the economy in shambles, i kinda feel bad eating such an expensive dinner. for<mark>Tuna (Big Eye)</mark>, my parents picked up the tab tonight as i had paid last night at the painted pony. maybe in 2009 they will have a recession special, like gray's papaya. ;p", 
            "yes, i'm a sushi lover and this place...honestly took my breath away. i was here during ces 2009 for work and my manager and i got invited to dinner with one of our partners at this restaurant. this place was packed when we showed up. the sake was amazing, even though i couldn't take much of it down since i had alcohol poisoning that morning ;p, yeah i know...i party hard even when i'm at work. but yes, the cod was intensely amazing and the <mark><mark>Lobster <mark>Miso Soup</mark></mark></mark> was quite awesome as well...definitely gonna hit this place up again when i'm in town.",

            "my buddy and i went to nobu this past friday night at 9:30 for their omasake chef choice tasting menu. we had very few disappointments. they sat us right away at the bar, tables would have been 15 minutes even with our reservations.  lots of good energy in the restaurant, lots of japanese yelling back and forth from the waiters and sushi chefs.  we split a $50 bottle of nonfiltered very fragrant nigori sake cold which was smooth and easy to drink. the small bits of rice at the bottle of the bottle reminded me of red wine sediment as a good thing. \n\nthe first course came out quick and cold. a chilled patty of toro tartar in a soy wasabi sauce topped <mark>Yellowtail or Salmon <mark>Blue Fin <mark>Toro Tartare</mark> with Royal Ossetra Caviar</mark></mark>, served with a baby silver spoon.  it was tender, smooth, rich and melt in your mouth.  the caviar was not memorable.  an a+ start and an expensive dish on their regular menu. next was 4 pieces per plate of thin cut fresh octopus topped with a cilantro leaf, a dot of super hot sauce, finished with citrus, like ceviche.  pretty good.  next was another cold appetizer of rice paper wrapped greens with a piece of raw ebi sweet shrimp, dressed with a fantastic sesame ginger sauce with a fried prawn head on the side.  my buddy especially liked the tempura batter on the <mark>Sweet Shrimp with Fried Head</mark> and the dressing.  i will personally come to your house and kill you if you do not eat the fried prawn head. \n\nthen started the hot plates.  first was the ever famous <mark>Black Cod Miso</mark> cod, a bit too sweet for my buddy but it did not keep us from both licking the plates.  a small piece of tender fish which just went on and on and kept melting in our mouths.  flavor of fish hard to come through past miso and sweetness.  like fish candy in a good way.  my friend said that an improvement would be to torch and crisp up the skin before putting on the sauce which would give some texture contrast and make the dish over the top.  $23 on the regular menu.  next was the beef tenderloin toban yaki style with a shitake and enokitake mushrooms and a piece of thin asparagus in a soy broth. beef very lean, not as melt in your mouth as i would like.  my buddy would have liked a nice piece of ribeye cap instead but who wouldn't.  the dish is served spitting hot on a mini hot plate and when they raise the cover in front of you, the steam envelopes you warmly.  try not to get the grease on you. \n\nnext was the nigiri sushi course of 5 pieces along with a nice clam <mark><mark>Lobster <mark>Miso Soup</mark></mark></mark>. we got a piece of <mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> (mmmm), magura tuna (so tender), yellowtail (yum), clam (a bit tough) and <mark>Sea Eel</mark> which was the most tender fall apart <mark>Sea Eel</mark> i have ever tasted.  the sushi rice <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> fill you to the gills by that point and then they hit you with the dessert which was a bento presentation of a warm flowerless chocolate lava cake with lots of lava and very little cake and a very good not sweet green tea <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark>.   this just put the nail in the coffin.  we were stuffed, but we couldn't stop eating since it was so good.  \n\nthe restaurant closed at 11pm on a friday night, but we will remember the meal for a long time coming.  next time i'm in vegas i plan to make it a point to return and see what the chef choice is at that point in time.  this was the $100 omasake.  the $150 would have <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> some kobe beef and <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> and there.  we were very happy with our choice.  i think the meal was an absolute bargain for the price.", 
            "not worth the hype. \n\nnobu isn't a japanese restaurant, it's a new age sushi restaurant. they may have borrowed their name from new york, but that's about where the similarities end. \n\nservice was friendly, but brisk. they clearly wanted to get us in and out of there since we were sitting at the bar. \n\nwe ordered <mark><mark>Lobster <mark>Miso Soup</mark></mark></mark>, the four <mark>Kelp Salad</mark> (their version of a seaweed salad), tamago, the chilean sea bass with a dried miso sauce, and chicken teriyaki. the miso was standard, and the tamago was much larger than what i'm used to, but both were good. <mark>Kelp Salad</mark> was a little too fishy for me, but then again, i had my heart set on seaweed salad. both the chilean sea bass and the chicken teriyaki were merely good, but not good enough for the ticket ($45 and $30 respectively) and neither came with rice.\n\nso why the three stars? we just weren't overwhelmed. nobu wasn't an impressive dining experience, and in this town, if you don't have experience, why bother?", 
            "this would have been four stars, but the inner kitchen made a serious error.  the decor was natural, grounding, with a slightly modern twist.  the restaurant was too loud, but the noise was voices and the casino a bit.  it would have been much better if it wasn't so loud and you could concentrate on the food.  \n\ni ordered the specialty tasting menu which is a seven course meal that is over a hundred dollars.  i made it known to my server that i eat \"kosher style only fish that have scales and fins, when alive e.g., salmon, tuna, white fish, etc, no shell fish under any circumstances, lard, red meat, or gelatin unless it is seaweed gelatin.\"   \n\nthe hors d'oeuvres, salad, and specialty roles were amazing!  they told stories in my mouth and gave me a unique and exhilarating experience. the warm dishes were good, but the specialty rolls are so much better.  stay away from the basic sashmi and regular rolls.  it wasn't worth it for the price.   \n\nthe fiasco really started when i was given <mark><mark>Lobster <mark>Miso Soup</mark></mark></mark> with shells in it!  that type of error should not happen.  it was a mistake in the kitchen, but the manager was very lucky that i was not allergic.  while she apologized, and asked how she could make it right.  i had to suggest a discount.  i think that it should have been immediately offered.  to the manager's credit she did ask if i had a shell fish allergy, and she did go immediately to talk to the kitchen, but that kind of error is inexcusable to me.  this is especially true given how much i stressed no shell fish and how severe shell fish allergies can be.", 
            "came here during restaurant week. i love the modern, sleek d\\u00e9cor which reminds you of the flagship house in la. \n\nokay, now the food. let me know just preface this by saying, this place should not tote itself as a japanese restaurant because most people should realize, this isn't. sure, it's got sushi and stuff but no dice. if you can move past that, then you may enjoy this place.\n\ntuna tataki -this is good. lightly seared but has a good taste to it\n<mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> -i'm not a fan of spicy but this does <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> nice kick to the yellowtail.\n<mark>Black Cod Miso</mark> - this was surprisingly really good. the fish was cooked wonderfully; just the right amount of crisp but moist/juicy flavor to it. \nassorted sushi -this is the most standard dish that you can get at any sushi joint, for 1/8 the price.\n<mark><mark>Lobster <mark>Miso Soup</mark></mark></mark> -i'm only commenting about this because i love how they call it \"sipping soup\" so at first you think you're getting something special...only to realize it's <mark><mark>Lobster <mark>Miso Soup</mark></mark></mark>.\nmochi was pretty delicious but i'm sure this was purchased at your local trader joes or mitsuwa.\n\nanyhow, it's worth stopping by to check out the d\\u00e9cor and if it's restaurant week. i would consider this place asian fusion more than japanese but eh, if you're craving asian food and you're staying at the hard rock, this is gonna be your best (and only) bet.", 
            "nobu should <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> letters to the end of its name: e-n-o.  \n\nthe food here tastes better than mcdonald's but worse than chipotle, but i would rate mcdonald's higher due to it being a better value.  we had the tasting menu <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> sushi.  the <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark>, along with every other cold dish, followed the same formula: raw fish + cilantro hidden underneath a pile of salt. the black cod <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark> and the beef tenderloin tasted like bad halloween candy.  everything was either drenched in salt or drenched in sugar, or both.  the sushi was not inedible, it was on par with the kind of sushi you can get from any two-dollar-sign sushi restaurant.  it's pretty hard to mess up sushi to the extent that they messed up their other dishes, since chefs have less artistic license when it comes to sushi.  then again, it's hard to mess up <mark><mark>Lobster <mark>Miso Soup</mark></mark></mark> and theirs was the worst i've ever had (way too salty).  service was good.  \n\nour bill, including tip, came out to nearly $600 for three people.  so if you want to trick your non-asian friends into believing that their palates lack the sophistication to appreciate expensive asian cuisine, nobu is the place to go.  or sometimes when you're feeling masochistic, you just want to get punched in the face.  that's when you go to nobu.  \n\nthere are many reasons to go to nobu, but edible food is not among them.  if you want good food, there are some great french options in the area, such as le cirque.", 
            "simply amazing best ever!!!   i struggled to give it 5 stars, i think i would call this a 4.5 star rating.   its a little overpriced for what it is, they need to do more food, i left hungry.  that shouldnt happen.  service 98 out of 100.  food 95 out of 100  value 80 out of 100.   i think it was a little overpriced, but the quality was totally there!   i would definitely go again, and i think i would love it again, but it let me down just a little, after hearing all the hype.   i could go here once , or go to sushi mon 4 times, all i can eat, you know my choice on that one if i want sushi 4 times!   \n\nafter the sticker shock, which i didnt pay so i dont care what it costs, the food was insanely good.  we had the saki, beers, and a feast of sashimi, shrimp, <mark><mark>Lobster <mark>Miso Soup</mark></mark></mark>, and rolls.   my favorite was the lettuce wrapped black cod, oh my god, this was the best fish bite i have ever had.  it melted in your mouth like butter from the fat and the protein - i am not sure if it was oil pan fried, or what, it was hot, but not too hot, but it had a little sizzle on it, and the glazed oil on it just <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> to the silky flavor.  i would go back there just for that!   the desert was a rhubarb molten love with <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark> over it, talk about yummy!   tasted like strawberries to me, but it was perfect, i would have taken one more scoop <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark>, next time i will ask.   i am sure they would accommodate.     5 star food at 5 star prices.    \n\ndecor was a little drab to me, i dont know what it was, it was classy, but too dark, the bamboo was nice, but i think they could use some live fish tank in the place, maybe i missed something, the walkway in was nice, but the dining room was a little drab for me.  i think a splash of color would have been nice.   anyway, i am nitpicking now and thats not fair to them.    quality stuff, incredible food, great dining room, great location at hard rock.  highly recommended.  please bring your wallet, or someone elses, you will need it!     also, be prepared for a late night snack later meal after, unless you are on a diet.    4.5 star overall, i likey!",

            "7/2: nobu hard rock rivals yellowtail @bellagio as my all-time favorite restaurant. i've been here one previous time and i don't remember much, but nothing bad. i just kept comparing it to my favorite, which is kind of unfair. however, this time was different...very memorable in a good way. \n\nmy server gordon and his waitstaff team's service was amazing! i had the locals tasting menu ($75) and it was worth every penny. every dish was cordially described in just the right amount of detail before being served. all questions were answered in a friendly manner. the atmosphere was very nice and classy as well. beautiful decor. \n\n-kobe beef taco (as an appetizer, separate from tasting menu)...best taco ever! beef was soft and moist\n\n-<mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> (best sashimi i've ever had by far! so soft and fresh. price tag aside, i could go for 10 of these plates! though that might be too much of a good thing)\n-tuna <mark><mark>Nobu's Moriawase Sashimi Salad</mark></mark> (love it. best tuna ever) \n-rock <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark> with creamy spicy (best shrimp ever...you're getting the point! i didnt know shrimp could taste this good) \n-<mark>Black Cod Miso</mark> (this and the yellowtail sashimi were my favorite dishes...high praise for these 2 seems to be the trend based off of many reviews. definitely no disagreement here. best fish ever! if you are ordering one item, i highly recommend it) \n-assorted sushi and <mark><mark>Lobster <mark>Miso Soup</mark></mark></mark> (basics but pretty good. large <mark>Scallop</mark> were <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> to the soup. unique taste and interesting twist compared to standard <mark><mark>Lobster <mark>Miso Soup</mark></mark></mark>. delicious!) \n-dessert (strawberry, vanilla, green tea <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark>)...all were great. not really a complaint, but a variety of <mark>Dessert</mark> is preferred. im sure they would be amazing like everything else as well.\n\nthank you nobu, for one of the best dining experiences ever. i will definitely be back!", 
            "had dinner here last night with friends and been here two other times.  everything is always fresh and creative.  once you get past the sticker shock you realize it's vegas and all nice restaurants cost an arm and a leg.  it's an experience though so just go with it.  we had <mark><mark>Lobster <mark>Miso Soup</mark></mark></mark>, beef and <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> tacos, <mark>King Crab Ceviche</mark>, shrimp and <mark>Scallop Tempura</mark>, some <mark>Dessert</mark>, and of course sake.  also, tons of sashimi including yelliowtail, tuna, <mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark>, wild yellowtail, and <mark>Snow Crab</mark>.  all awesome.  the service was great, the place is very nice, and the food is always great and fresh.",

            "we planned to have dinner with our friends who live in vegas on one night of our two night stay there recently. after scouring the restaurant recommendations from my friend, we decided on nobu. sometimes i have to be in the mood for sushi, i don't always crave it like other people i know, so i was worrying about committing to a reservation. i was also worried about having to pay a million dollars (slight exageration; i don't even have a million dollars, and if i did, i would only spend half on wine) for any good wine. (true story, i made the mistake of ordering a glass of wine at the bar in the casino at the flamingo (don't ask) one night and it had me wishing for manischewitz.)\n\nok - back to the matter at hand: nobu has now made me crave sashimi, sushi and all japanese food all the time. not only did the server rattle off, in detail, and totally and completely from her memory, just about every item listed on the menu, but the food was amazing. i die. we had a smattering of everything from each \"category\" and honestly, went a bit overboard, but it was a meal well worth going over board on. \n\nwe dined on:\n\n-edamame\n-<mark><mark>Lobster <mark>Miso Soup</mark></mark></mark>\n-tempura fried rock shrimp <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> type of delicious citrusy, creamy sauce\n-<mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> (out of this world)\n-red <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark> (also, amazing)\n-salmon <mark>White Fish <mark>Scallop <mark>Salmon <mark>Oyster <mark>Beef <mark>Yuba Sashimi New Style</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark> sashimi, which was lightly seared and served with green onion, absolutely delicious\n-<mark>Soft Shell Crab</mark> roll\n-spicy <mark>Big Eye Tuna Roll</mark> (cause, come on, you gotta round out the meal)\n\nthe dessert was good but unremarkable. i'm more about the main event.\n\ncap that <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> amazing gin cocktail that i now forget the name of and two glasses of hellaciously expensive, but delicious, sauvignon blanc, and this is one of the top meals i have had in my little life thus far... \n\nin short, take your gambling winnings to nobu and order everything the server suggests.", 
            "service at nobu is always par none! paired with my favorite standbys here...yellowtail sashimi with jalape\\u00f1o!!!! this dish is a signature and is undeniably one of my favorites in the world. super tender and the perfect combination of savory and perfect kick from the fresh jalape\\u00f1o! the rock shrimp are just amazing with a creamy sauce and again with a perfect bite at the finish. our server offered a variation of my favorite <mark>Black Cod Miso</mark> cod- small portions served on butter lettuce cups that rocked so much i ordered a second. \n\nfor our special adventure we opted for the <mark>Hearts of Palm</mark> pasta- again a kick and for me interesting but not a fav yet clarence loved it! last and should have been first was their <mark><mark>Lobster <mark>Miso Soup</mark></mark></mark>- probably the best anywhere , served piping hot and i enjoy it as a finish. \n\nthe wagyu beef was so tempting but i passed. it is hard for me to order a dish equivalent to two new pairs of shoes... honestly we have never been disappointed in a nobu splurge. i was pretty full before the table next to us ordered it and caused me to have food envy but there is always next time. \n\naaron was a super knowledgable and very attentive. the team of secondary servers were all on point. huge kudus to the whole team here from start to finish with a standing o for the chef and kitchen too!", 
            "over priced food that is just totally made up. considering who amd what nobu is, this place is truely a disappointment. service in general is okay but food comes out in the strangest order.\n\nthe 2 times ive been here ive had my order arrive last and everyone is waiting in me. considering what i order should come first, its amazing how im last to get any food.\n\nmy most recent visit i had an order of <mark><mark>Lobster <mark>Miso Soup</mark></mark></mark> which i had to asl for 4 times and didnt arrive until we paid the bill.\n\ndont be fooled by the name. this place is certainly low standard versus any other high cost food place.\n\nthe food itself is nothing special and looks rushed as if the kitchen just cares about turning food out.", 
            "this is by far the worst nobu i have ever been to.  i've been to numerous nobu's around the world.  my wife and i ordered the chefs tasting omakase, and was very dissatisfied.  one of the plates brought out was <mark><mark>Lobster <mark>Miso Soup</mark></mark></mark> and another a regular plate of tuna and salmon sushi- not even toro.  my bill was close to $500 btw.  stay far away from this nobu.  the quality and ambiance of this place doesn't deserve to be called a nobu franchise restaurant.  there are 2 other nobu's in vegas that are better than this place i'm sure.",

            "i'll be honest. i came here for the dessert tasting platter. \n\ni saw the dessert list and died a little at the unique, creative and hitherto unknown creations being offered. so did my boyfriend. we decided we had to make it to nobu even if the apocalypse happened and giant flesh-eating gargoyles descended from the sky.\n\ni did not plan to have a full meal at all but wouldn't you know it, i did. ahhh, i love when upscale japanese restaurants live up to the hype.\n\nyellowtail with jalape\\u00f1o: tender slices of my fish soulmate in an amazing soy yuzu sauce with just a little kick. most perfect dish ever.\n\nbeef tenderloin tabu yaki: not quite as tender as kobe (is anything?) but delicious nonetheless.\n\n<mark>Spicy Scallop</mark> roll: fresh and tasty. the boyfriend was blown away by it, i thought it was good but otherwise unremarkable. i think raw scallop might be his yellowtail, though.\n\nblack cod <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark>: their signature dish. it's really hard to find fault with it. tender, melt-in-your-mouth fish in a sweet, light sauce. it should be heavy, but it's not. that's the miracle of japanese cooking.\n\n<mark>Spicy Seafood Soup</mark>: my favorite kind of food--soupy, spicy, seafoody. oh, and as an <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> bonus, loaded with more varieties of mushroom than a drug farmer. i have seen heaven and it's inside this bowl. get it!\n\nnow on to the nobu dessert platter:\n\n<mark>Bento Box</mark>: flourless chocolate cake with a white chocolate sauce, shiso syrup and green tea <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark>. like a japanese molten cake. did i mention that molten cake is like edible carnal sex? well, it is. so get this. just don't go all matrix reloaded in the restaurant.\n\ntrio of mochi: lessee, we got pumpkin spice, strawberry, <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> flavor not known to man, stuffed with ice-cream and accompanied by sour japanese mountain peaches. mmm...\n\nbananas in phyllo dough with tropical glaze: original creation not on the regular menu (haha!). it's crispy, fried bananas. need i say more?\n\nharom<mark>Aji (Jackfish)</mark> in cinnamon and sugar and center is sweet potato pur\\u00e9e: i totally didn't spell that right and since it's another original creation, i have no menu to look at. already tried googling and found nothing. anyway, this was incredible. i hate sweet potato and i thought this was da bomb. yeah, i'm channeling 2001 lingo.\n\neat here.", 
            "extensive menu with fusion of s american and japanese (reminded me of roy's).  very friendly staff.  yellowtail with jalape\\u00f1os tasty but a bit of a soy bite; sweet tuna on chips but not spicy as advertised; eggplant <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark> was spot on - toasty, juicy, salty, silky, warm. miso with crunchy green onions and silky tofu was great. <mark>Spicy Seafood Soup</mark> with tons of fresh seafood and mushrooms.  veggie tempura was good, but nothing too special outside of the wild mushroom - yumm!  finished up with assorted mochi - mint chocolate, mango, cherry blossom, pistachio.\n\nno wifi. bathrooms outside restaurant - shared with hard rock hotel, really?", 
            "10 star if possible! this restaurant is the only reason i go to the hard rock. the food is simply amazing. you must try the miso black cod....absolute favorite of mine, <mark>Spicy Seafood Soup</mark> is delish as well as the <mark>Mushroom Salad</mark>. i have had sushi there a few times but it's not the star of the show in my opinion. the place is always busy so i suggest making a reservation. now as far as the price, it's $$$$...but you get what you pay for! ladies i suggest going with your significant other :) i will be dining there over and over again. simply amazing."

            "we decided to try this place while in vegas as i knew the nobu in new york is the real deal. first of all, it was in a weird location inside the hard rock, hard to find at first. we were dressed up a bit for a nice dinner and were getting some stares as everyone in the lobby was super casual. we walked past the slot machines, drunk frat boy almost falling over us, and there, we finally found it. decor was quite dated and not so impressive for its name. we had wine and <mark>Sake Flight</mark> and way too much of it before food but the sashimi is the thing to get here. it's not raw, seared lightly <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> delicious sauce. sushi was very fresh as well. our waiter was very funny and knowledgeable. overall, even though it was quite expensive, it was doable according to the vegas standard and i would return here again so that i can say, \" can i have 10 plates of sashimi only please!\"", 
            "first impression: cheap chopsticks! really? i don't want to taste wood while i'm eating expensive food. \n\nthe waiter, billy, was great! even though i couldn't hear half of the things he was saying, he was really into the presentation and food. the atmosphere was loud so i could not hear. \n\nwe were two people on a romantic vacation. we both decided to get one of the chefs <mark>Daily Seafood Selection</mark> and one of the creations where they choose from the existing menu. my dining partner also elected to get the <mark>Sake Flight</mark> - a presentation of a carefully selected sake to accompany the dish they select for you. everything was great! we both have our favorites and preferences, but not having been there before, it was nice to have someone else choose the better dishes. i expected to leave hungry. instead, i was so full i thought i was going to die. could have done without the final sushi dishes or dessert. this trip was meant to be a search for interesting food. i think we were pleasantly interested. just two suggestions: go lighter on the sauces. good fish does not need to be covered up with a heavy sauce. secondly, change the decor. wooden tables and cheap wooden chopsticks leave you with a sense of the mediocre not extravagant."

            "nobu is easily my favorite place to dine in las vegas.  i've been told their traditional sashimi and nigiri offerings are fresh and tasty, but i wouldn't know, because nobu offers up so many unique south-american influenced japanese dishes that i only order from their special items.  i recommend you do the same; you didn't come to vegas to be boring and unadventurous, so why change now?\r\n\r\nthe star of the menu is the broiled black cod <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark>.  when you go, check with the waiter to see if this dish is available with the phyllo dough wrap; if it is, order it that way and prepare for the best thing to ever enter your mouth.  also great are fresh <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark>, <mark>White Fish <mark>Scallop <mark>Salmon <mark>Oyster <mark>Beef <mark>Yuba Sashimi New Style</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark> sashimi, and <mark><mark>Nobu's Moriawase Sashimi Salad</mark></mark> with matsuhisa dressing.  \r\n\r\nmy rating is 1 star shy of a perfect score only because eating there burns a serious hole in my wallet (this ain't todai after all); if only it were not as expensive, i could go more often to feast on the delicious food.", 
            "nobu is a great place to splurge when you have time and want to have good japanese food.  a few quick notes about how to eat there.\n\n1, i've heard the omikase is excellent. it's a safe way to try a nice selection of things.\n2, be nice to your waiter, and it will make all the difference. in general, be nice to the person that brings you your food, and you'll have a better, healthier, more hygenic meal, but here, being nice can mean great service, good advice, and a wonderful experience. i have 1 friend who is a waiter there, and if he can't serve me when i go, i make sure one of the other folks who has helped him wait on me before is my waiter, and i've never had a bad meal, bad location, or bad service.\n3, the black cod <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark>, and hamachi <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> and ponzu are  musts on the menu. i also recommend the squid pasta, rock <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark>, <mark><mark>Nobu's Moriawase Sashimi Salad</mark></mark>, and spicy <mark>Big Eye Tuna Roll</mark>.  the spicy <mark>Big Eye Tuna Roll</mark> there is the best version i've ever had.  the black cod is probably the best treatment of cooked fish i've ever consumed.\n4, enjoy the celebrity spotting. i actually sat next to wayne brady (a very nice guy, and super polite to the staff) at one dinner, and tiffany amber thiessen was there a different night. i can't say the same nice things about her that i mentioned about wayne brady.\n\nall in all, a great meal.  and get the nigori sake...best bang for your buck alcohol wise, and very tasty.", 
            "i was really ready to give nobu an average rating - how much can you really pay for fish?  how good could it really be?  it really is that good.\n\ni was in vegas for a bachelorette party <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> girlfriends, and we went to nobu.  i'd been to nobu next door ages ago in nyc...and i thought it was good but not outstanding.  apparently they save the good stuff for the \"real\" restaurant.\n\ni was underwhelmed by the resaurant decor - it seemed a little bit like any generic japanese restaurant.  but the food was awesome.  we had the tuna <mark><mark>Nobu's Moriawase Sashimi Salad</mark></mark> - tuna was so good and the salad dressing was awesome (i love japanese salad dressing), hamachi <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> peppers, salmon sashimi with chives (loved it - and i'm not even a huge salmon fan), miso cod (liked it...but definitely loved the sashimi more) and the real winner i wasn't expecting was this <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark> dish...  tiny pieces of friend shrimp covered in some sort of mayonnaise-y kind of sauce.  delish.  \nto accommodate some non-fish eaters, we got chicken which was fine, but really, who goes to nobu for chicken?  \n\ni may have to take out a second mortgage on my non-existent house, but it was worth it...", 
            "as an avid sushi chick ... i was looking forward to chef matsushita to wow me. \n\nthe place was expectedly pretty ... the $14 cucumber martini (lame). \nignorable since i came here to be \"wow\"ed by the food not the booze. the waitress was really really really sweet and the couple sitting next to us shared their sake with us ... which was sweet. \nwe were debating between sticking to rolls and your average japanese food or the chef's specialty.\n\n$100 for the omakase ... an extra $35 for \"better quality food\".  *ding*\n\n1. gazpacho w/ a white asparagus eggroll. gazpacho = ok. eggroll = interesting. a lame start for a meal i was expecting to be great. \n\n2. bonito, some other weird fish and a japanese fish i can't remember \"sashimi\" = interesting. the salsa made the dish. it was ok. \n\n3. <mark><mark>Nobu's Moriawase Sashimi Salad</mark></mark> w/ sake and peppers and onions = ok. i was still waiting to be wowed at this point ... then again ... this was just the start ... a small build up to what's going to be great... right??!\n\n4. peppered sea bass w/ truffle sauce = ... the highlight of the meal. some parts had some serious pepper ... but it was good. \n\n5. kobe beef <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> sort of lame tabasco = the beef was good. the tabasco ... lame.\n\n*insert some weird apple sauce shot w/ a mandarin orange* \n\n*this is where it gets bad*\n\n6. soup. how do you mess up <mark><mark>Lobster <mark>Miso Soup</mark></mark></mark>? ... put an unfresh clam in it with serious sand in it. \n\n7. sushi. eel / half raw supposedly cooked but still slimy shrimp / ? / ? = i had never gagged and vomitted into my napkin until this very moment in time. i choked on an eel bone and the skin of the eel still had scales. the eel itself was sour. the rest of the fish was disguised with the not optional wasabi ball that was lodged into the rice ball. ... and of course more tabasco. \n\n... *insert bathroom runs 3x*\n\n8. green tea weird thing with pineapple foam = good.\n\ni was not at all impressed. i left sick and wanting the meal to end as soon as possible... i didn't even finish my cocktail. :(\n\n... i should have stuck to the rolls.", 
            "amazing!!! were the first words i thought of when i was dining and leaving this restaurant.  my best friend recommended this restaurant as we were planning our vegas trip.  i didn't think much about this place when he brought it up, my expectations were pretty much non-existent.  once we got to the restaurant, it was top notch from start to finish.  we ordered quite a bit of different dishes and it was delicious down to the last bite.  our waiter was quite helpful with our decision making and recommendations.  first dish on our table was the fresh <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark>.  this dish is awesome!  the flavoring along with the fresh yellowtail easily makes this my favorite dish at this restaurant.  we also had the monkfish pate, <mark><mark>Nobu's Moriawase Sashimi Salad</mark></mark>, black cod <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark>, broiled yellowtail collar; <mark>Creamy Spicy Crab</mark>, rock <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark> <mark>King Crab with Amazu Ponzu</mark> and creamy spicy sauce.  all around delicious dishes with great visual presentation.  their lychee martini is also worth a mention, a tasty treat.  i highly recommend this restaurant for those who haven't tried it yet.  this is easily one of my top 10 restaurants.  just a wonderful experience from beginning to finish!", 
            "our first stop during our trip to vegas this past week. we decided to come here to celebrate my aunties birthday! my cousin and i have heard so much about the place we had to try it with our mother's during our mother/daughter trip to vegas.  here is what we ordered\n\nyellowtail w/ jalapeno (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tcwmgoiv0pxqkwe1sybiwq?select=dwkr-lhpvr9kfivr4q7ptq: very delicious, my mother and cousin who do not eat sashimi even enjoyed the dish. after the dinner when i asked them what their favorite dish was this was on the top. it is slices of yellowtail sashimi w/ a type of ponzu sauce and good to eat with the small slice of jalapeno and cilantro. i think i've had similar dishes like this at other restaurants but i think b/c its from nobu it just makes it that much better. \n\n<mark><mark>Nobu's Moriawase Sashimi Salad</mark></mark> (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tcwmgoiv0pxqkwe1sybiwq?select=12qbnh80ncnjdby_mzvnog): the dressing on this salad was very good and tasty. it comes with mixed greens in the middle and like seared ahi layering the outside. i wish it had a couple of different types of sashimi in the salad but that's okay, it still tasted good. \n\n<mark>Scallop</mark> with filo on lettuce cups (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tcwmgoiv0pxqkwe1sybiwq?select=nk22wem6xycmo21jvgpjvq): this was probably my favorite dish. the scallop melted in your mouth and the taste was pretty good. i think the <mark>Scallop</mark> were made with a miso sauce and had green onions sprinkled on top. whatever it was it was super super good. ahhh drool.\n\nwhole deep fried cod or snapper i don't remember the name of the fish on top of sauteed veggies in a miso butter sauce (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tcwmgoiv0pxqkwe1sybiwq?select=vefn4poi2zsbdznyhzaaxq): this was another special. the waiter told us that everyone raves about this dish. it came out and we were all in awe. it was pretty big. the table was in wow when my mother and my auntie started laughing... they then asked one of the waiters how much it was $100.00.. wow, didn't realize that when we ordered it. i think it should have been something that the waiter said, especially since it cost so much.  needless to say the fish was delicious! you can eat almost every single piece of it. the fins where crunchy and were very good dipped in the miso butter sauce. the sauce was sweet with a little spicy. the sauteed veggies were also very good and eaten with the fish heavenly. we picked at this dish the whole dinner and still weren't able to eat the whole thing.  bummer b/c we definitely tried, we knew we had to get our moneys worth if we were going to spend $100 on one dish. \n\nsushi and the tempura dinner: nothing spectacular about either of these dishes. i don't even remember what rolls we got except for the house roll which wasn't anything special. i would definitely skip both if you are coming here. get these at some other restaurant. \n\nthe service was good but not spectacular. they have a lot of people working here but nobody went out of their way to enhance our experience. \n\noverall i would come here again. there are a couple other things i would like to try off their menu.", 
            "this is my second time here and both times i've come with my cousin. as much i love nobu, i only go there with her, since she loves it so much, but i never regret it. \n\nthe nice thing is i just let her order, since she knows what's good, but then if i ever go alone, i won't really know what to order. i did have a nice acai cocktail to start the night. it was delicious and refreshing, great way to start the meal. \n\nwe ordered the <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> which i loved since i love the spice. then we had the seafood spring rolls which weren't on the menu, but since they go there all the time, they knew about it. those were also really good, along with the <mark><mark>Nobu's Moriawase Sashimi Salad</mark></mark>. loved the dressing and there was so much sashimi! we also had the rock <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark>, which was kinda like popcorn shrimp, but really tasty <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> grilled beef thing. \n\nat the end, we ordered the <mark>Bento Box</mark>, which was a flourless chocolate cake with green tea <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark>. everything was really good, but service was a little slow. my other friends were also there and they were a party of 10. they started a little after us but finished before us!! other than that though, it was a great night.", 
            "i've been dying to try out nobu and matsuhisa in la for the longest time, but the thought of making a drive that far just for sushi just couldn't be justified...until now. nobu is actually a japanese fusion restaurant, so for all of you purest out there, this is not your dining of choice.\n\nnow for the food...the ingredients are what make japanese food such a delicacy. and when it comes to seafood, especially sashimi, if your stock isn't fresh, i can taste it. that said, we decided to stuff our faces for the true nobu experience. \n\n*the yk50 is a semi-dry and rather sweet sake that was super light\n*<mark>Shishito Peppers</mark> - grilled peppers w/ an extremely simple miso sauce w/ toasted sesame\n*tuna tataki. great sauce, perfect w/ the daikon and garlic chips.\n*kumamoto oysters. not the best i've had, the sauces actually took away from the natural sweetness of this variety of oyster.\n*yellowtail sashimi w/ jalapenos. probably my favorite of the meal. extremely simple sauce w/ a spicy bite. my mouth is salivating just thinking about it :p\n*<mark><mark>Nobu's Moriawase Sashimi Salad</mark></mark>. we got a tuna/hamachi mix instead. it had a delicious miso dressing on a medley spring mix\n*amai ebi. it was a little oily this time, but the shrimp was ridiculously fresh.\n*crunchy roll w/ king crab. probably my least favorite of the night. it was creative though with the crunch topping that gave a nice twist on the typical roll.\n*tempura plate. the <mark>Vegetable</mark> were so sweet, it didn't even require the tentsuyu (tempura sauce)\n*fried shrimp w/ butter ponzu sauce. butter and ponzu is an amazing combination. so its not typical japanese but definitely try this one if you get a chance. \n\ni do believe i've never truly experienced a food coma until tonight.", 
            "every detail was covered, from a rich broth of <mark><mark>Lobster <mark>Miso Soup</mark></mark></mark> with clams to lovely service from a friendly server. he was really informative and helped us pick through the menu. the interior is contemporary japanese and beautiful. and the food was fantastic.\n\nwe had a tasty hamachi <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> slices. i've had this dish at other places but nobu slices the jalapenos paper thin and dresses the fish in a fantastic sauce. their rendition also includes a cilantro leaf and i'm a huge fan of the herb. great balance of flavors and quality of fish.\ntuna <mark><mark>Nobu's Moriawase Sashimi Salad</mark></mark>. this is a mountain of crisp salad with the sashimi draped around the base. it's a little technically difficult to eat because i wasn't sure how to get it all in one bite. but the salad was delicious and the tuna was, of course, amazing.\nblue fin toro <mark>Yellowtail or Salmon <mark>Blue Fin <mark>Toro Tartare</mark> with Royal Ossetra Caviar</mark></mark>. i think toro needs to be eaten as sashimi/nirigi or over rice as chirashi. mincing it up seems wrong.\n\nand the highlight was the <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> dish with seven spices and liberal amounts of clarified butter. holy gawd!! this was fantastic!! it was an explosion of flavors in your mouth and utterly, indescribably delicious. they split the <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> in half, cook the meat in large chunks, and then place it back into the shell. it makes for a beautiful presentation yet the tender chunks of meat are easy to remove and eat.\n\ninterestingly, i've been to other nobu restaurants and the menu is strikingly similar. i don't know why, but that seems odd.", 
            "maybe it's becuase i live in a state not known for it's seafood -- but nobu consistently has the best sushi and fish i've ever eaten.     it is the first reservation i make when going to las vegas or dallas for work.  \n\nyep it's pricy but i have dreams about it -- it's that good !!   and i've even paused my television when i saw some psuedo celebs eating there on some reality tv show -- when they were eating my favorite things.\n\nthe trick is really to just get the good stuff -- it's over the top fantastic but when i try new stuff it never quite lives up to the others ..\n\n1,  <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> -- get at least 2 orders -- i could eat 3-4 by myself if i really tried hard.\n\n2.  black cod <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark> -- either version (in lettuce cups or not)\n\n3.   tuna <mark><mark>Nobu's Moriawase Sashimi Salad</mark></mark> -- yum !!!\n\n4.   any other sushi -- but if you get rolls - i suggest you pay extra for rice paper instead of seaweed (did this cuz one friend is allergic to seaweed and it makes the fish stand out).\n\n5.  rock shrimp\n\n6.  <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark>\n\n7.  <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark>\n\n8.   <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark>\n\n9.   <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark>\n\n10.  <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> \n\n(did you get it yet ???)\n\nand the service is always top notch !!!    attentive and knowledgeable ....   and the drinks are fantastic too !\n\nit is a spendy dinner -- but in my opinion -- totally worth it !!!", 
            "bluf...the dining highlight of my trip to vegas with my girlfriend was our dinner at nobu.  this was my third trip to nobu, each time having had the chef's omakase tasting menu.  nobu's tasting menu is a thoughtfully composed meal served kaiseki-style (sort of a themed meal) that seeks to tie together individual dishes by attributes like taste, texture, and temperature to enhance the overall experience of the meal.  since there isn't a set menu, you select the price point you're willing to pay and the chef and the kitchen staff prepares an appropriate amount of courses using whatever exotic ingredients they deem fit.  we both received 9 courses with sake pairing. \n\nfirst course:  we started with a kumamoto oyster wrapped in <mark>Smoked Salmon</mark> topped with a osetra caviar, served on an endive leaf in an asparagus \"boat\" with accompanied by sweet <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> miso sauces.  a masterful start!  the 5 basic tastes were tastefully and elegantly captured together in a single dish! \n\nsecond course:  shima-aji sashimi served in a tosazu (vinegared sardines) gel\\u00e9e with micro celery and \"sea grapes\" kelp...garnished with pickled turnip.  a great all-around dish, but the pickle turnip was the ingredient that put it over the top!\n\nthird course:  bluefin tuna sashimi topped <mark>Squid 'Pasta' with Light Garlic</mark> pur\\u00e9e and sliced serrano chilies with jalape\\u00f1o emulsion over brown rice salsa.  i love sashimi, but the garlicky goodness and spiciness from the chilies was amazing.  the brown rice salsa was damn tasty in its own right!\n\nfourth course:  <mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> and seared sweet shrimp <mark><mark>Nobu's Moriawase Sashimi Salad</mark></mark> served with m\\u00e2che, peppercorn, <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Whole <mark>1/2 Maine Lobster</mark></mark> <mark>Roasted Poussin with Spicy Lemon</mark></mark> dressing.   another success!  the peppercorns gave it the spicy notes that greatly accented the raw fish.\n\nintermezzo:  a <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark>...a simple yet refreshing palate cleanser that marked the transition from cold dishes to hot.\n\nfifth course:  pan-seared seabass, seasonal mushrooms, and wild ramps served in a <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> sauce.  as much as i loved the seabass, the earthy mushrooms and ramps nearly stole the show in this dish!\n\nsixth course:  grilled wagyu beef with seared <mark>Teppan Style Foie Gras</mark> served over yellow sweet corn and snap peas <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark>-mirin reduction.  the oh-so-tender australian-raised wagyu beef paired nicely with the perfectly seared <mark>Teppan Style Foie Gras</mark>.  \n\nseventh course:  dashi <mark>Inaniwa Pasta with Lobster</mark> and enoki mushroom with japanese greens.  so simple, yet such an incredibly satisfying dish!  they didn't skimp on the lobster, either.  in many ways, this was my favorite dish of the night.\n\neighth course:  a selection of sushi...otoro (fatty tuna), tasmanian sea trout, <mark>Sea Eel</mark>, a fish i can't recall, mirugai (geoduck), and tamago (egg omelet).  i love sushi.  i loved all of these nigiri!\n\nninth course:  shiso (?) panna cotta with strawberry \"caviar\", an understated but very satisfying closer to our meal.  the \"caviar\" was made to resemble ikura or salmon roe and was a very nice, creative touch.\n\nas for our sake, chris (i think that was his name), our lead server, informed us that nobu imports its sake from japan and that it's made especially for nobu.  i'm not an expert, at all, on the finer aspects of sake.  suffice it to say, our pairings were very nice, with subtle, yet interesting differences between each glass and went well with each dish.  chris did a great job all-around job taking care of us.  we had a very leisurely meal, never feeling rushed, but we never had to wait for our next course or glass of sake.  the timing was impeccable!\n\ni'm really not the type of person to toss out superlatives casually, but our meal was arguably one of the best meals i've ever had...at least since i've started yelping!  each dish was memorable and no single dish clearly stood out as the best since they were all outstanding!  it takes a lot of hair-splitting to even pick a dish that was less satisfying that the rest but if i had to pick one, it was the wagyu and <mark>Teppan Style Foie Gras</mark> course...and that was only due to the impression that the accompaniments on other dishes were more exciting than the sweet corn and snap peas.  if you're in vegas for one night and can only eat at one place while you're there, go to nobu and have the omakase tasting menu!  you won't regret it!", 
            "nirvana - pure nirvana. my taste buds were happy, i was very happy. \n\nmy bf too me here (my first trip) for our saturday night dinner. we knew when we walked in that we were having the omakase. i truly cannot pick out one single dish that i liked over the others - every single one was executed perfectly. our waiter was kind enough to write down what we had so we could remember. though he didn't write down the sake pairings we had - every single one of them matched perfectly with the dish. my only sadness with the sake is that i can't buy it anywhere since it is made for nobu (perhaps time to sale it at the restaurant???) \n\ncourse 1: kumomoto oysters, wrapped in <mark>Smoked Salmon</mark> with osetra caviar, served with endive <mark>Tuna (Big Eye) and Asparagus</mark> in sweet and spicy miso sauces (sweet and spicy? oysters? what is not to love?) \n\ncourse 2: <mark>Shima Aji</mark> sashimi served in tosazu gelee with micro celery and sea grapes kelp; garnished with pickled turnip (i'm not normally a turnip fan, but you could serve this to me anytime!) \n\ncourse 3: bluefin tuna sashimi topped <mark>Squid 'Pasta' with Light Garlic</mark> puree and sliced jalapeno, served <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> emulsion over brown rice salsa (okay a truly unique dish - and it was spicy! you know i like spice in my life!) \n\ncourse 4: <mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> trout and seared sweet shrimp <mark><mark>Nobu's Moriawase Sashimi Salad</mark></mark> served with mache, peppercorn, <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Whole <mark>1/2 Maine Lobster</mark></mark> <mark>Roasted Poussin with Spicy Lemon</mark></mark> dressing. (this fish was so succulent, buttery and full of flavor - if only i could find this in dc) \n\ncourse 5: pan seared seagrass, seasonal mushrooms, wild ramps, served in <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> sauce \n\ncourse 6: grilled washu beef with eared <mark>Teppan Style Foie Gras</mark>, served over yellow sweet corn and snap peas <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark>-mirin reduction \n\ncourse 7: soup with huge chunks of lobster (yup - huge); loved the little enoki mushrooms in it! \n\ncourse 8: sushi: one standout for me - salt <mark>Fresh Water Eel</mark> with this leaf that kinda tasted like basil <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Whole <mark>1/2 Maine Lobster</mark></mark> <mark>Roasted Poussin with Spicy Lemon</mark></mark> together. wow - yummy (this from the girl who wouldn't eat eel for a long time). not that the other offerings weren't good. \n\ncourse 9: dessert. panna cotta (i think) with strawberry caviar - the caviar was awesome! \n\nfinal: three types of fruit sake. my favorite was the ginger. \n\ni have to say this was one of the highlights of our trip. thoroughly enjoyed the meal and would gladly go again and again.", 
            "oh nobu - mi amore!!  \n\ni've been to this restaurant countless times and it is always amazing!   after my recent visit i realized i have to give proper respect and yelp my love for them.  here are some of my favorites:\n\ntoro <mark>Yellowtail or Salmon <mark>Blue Fin <mark>Toro Tartare</mark> with Royal Ossetra Caviar</mark></mark> - this dish makes me want to commit a felony.  if i were on death row it would be my last meal, i would definitely die happy.  as one of my favorite sayings on howard stern perfectly stated, this dish will make you 'go ahead and release the poison'.\n\n<mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> - always fresh and delicious!  i believe that all other sushi restaurants have tried to duplicate this dish but can never quite get the perfect flavor. \n\n<mark><mark>Nobu's Moriawase Sashimi Salad</mark></mark> - bam!  the dressing is off the chain, the tuna beyond fresh.  \n\nkobe beef toban yaki - i'm not a religious person by any means but i'm certain the heeled hands of jesus came down and prepared this dish himself with the blessing of his father.\n\nof course you cannot go there without consuming a couple of their saketini's.  why can't any other bar/restaurant get their saketini's to be this delicious??  they are alone worth a visit there.",

            "nobu would have gotten the 5th star, except for the loud music, and the decidedly non-intimate seating. my wife and i aren't opposed to answering a question about a dish, but when the folks next to you can lean over and check out what you're eating, well...i understand that that's the place's image, but it just keeps it from being a 5-star dining experience, imo.\n\nwe went on a sunday night at 7:30p. we were seated immediately, and our server brought the drink menus. my wife had the passion mojito, and i stuck with a sapporo because i'm not a huge fan of sake. the drink menu was replaced with the dinner menu, but we were pretty sure we were going to have the omakase.\n\nthere are two basic \"levels\" of omakase...each is composed of a mixture of cold dishes, hot dishes, sushi, and dessert. the lower-priced version ($100) contains more traditional dishes, and the higher priced version ($135) was said to be more \"exotic\". we both opted for the latter. i was trying to listen to the explanation of each dish and then scribble them down, so i likely missed some of the little accompaniments/garnishes. \n\n- kumamoto oyster, on the half-shell, with nobu salsa\n- sweet shrimp (sashimi-style, no rice, and no tempura head)\n- some kind of shellfish sashimi-style (either scallop or clam, i'm leaning towards scallop, based on the texture and the menu offerings)\nall three of these items were served on the same plate, the latter two with, i think, ponzu sauce. the oyster was pretty large, such that i didn't want to pick the shell up and end up wearing some of it. the sweet shrimp was very rich and quite tasty, and what i'm assuming was the scallop was a little firmer than i would expect, but still very good.\n\n- kampachi sashimi with kelp and mushroom \nkampachi is one of my favorite fish, and this did not disappoint. the kelp and mushroom, i think, were kept subtle so as not to overpower the fish...you could actually skip the kelp and mushrooms if you were trying to save room for later. \n\n- new-style unagi (lightly seared) layered with shiitake over a bed of tofu, with uni on the side\nthey have a really good sauce for the uni, because i don't like uni, and this tasted great! :) the unagi was also wonderful when prepared like this, as the meat is very tender, and no powerful marinade.\n\n- toro salad with vegetable spring roll\ni wasn't crazy about the spring roll...i thought it was bland. the toro salad, however, was very good.\n\n- green tea & ume sorbet\ni guess this was a palate cleanser? i wasn't expecting to get something like this in the middle of the meal. after the server brought it out, i told my wife, \"thank you for dining at nobu, please come back soon.\" anyway, it was not overly sweet, and would be fine as a dessert after a big meal.\n\n- broiled snapper over risotto with <mark>Snow Crab</mark> meat, topped with a white truffle chip \nthe hot dishes started with a small chunk of snapper that was done pretty much perfectly, no color, but still very juicy. the risotto was ok, nothing special, but the rice went well with the fish.\n\n- small, sliced, grilled \"kobe\" beef tenderloin with okinawa potatoes served alongside a slice of grilled japanese eggplant topped with a small piece of grilled <mark>Teppan Style Foie Gras</mark>.\ni'm going to commit heresy in a bit...i put kobe in quotes, because i hear a bunch of stories about whether or not kobe is kobe, but this tenderloin was done rare, and the potatoes went nicely with it. great dish. i don't really like eggplant, but this was ok, so they did something right. i'd never had <mark>Teppan Style Foie Gras</mark> before, and, well, meh? there, i said it.\n\n- <mark><mark>Lobster <mark>Miso Soup</mark></mark></mark> with clam\nanother break, like the sorbet. it wasn't bad or anything, but i was getting kinda full, so i almost skipped it. (almost).\n\n- nigiri sampler: oh toro, pink snapper, sardine, <mark>Snow Crab</mark>, <mark>Jumbo Clam</mark>\nthe clam was fresh and crunchy, but the <mark>Snow Crab</mark> was pretty ordinary. this was only the second time i've had sardine nigiri. i like sardine under other circumstances, but for sushi, i think it's just too oily? i couldn't tell the difference between the pink snapper and, say, fresh tai, but it was very firm and tasty. my wife told me the oh toro was awful and that i should consider letting her eat it for me, as she didn't want it to ruin my dinner. i love her very much, but in matters of sushi, she is not to be trusted. :) try the oh toro.\n\n- blancmange (yogurt, in this case) over almond crisp, pomegranate seeds, and assorted frozen berries.\nfull. i almost had to pass on dessert (almost). again, not overly sweet, which is a plus in my book, and the berries and almond crisp combined very well. \n\nthe service was tremendous, as the restaurant has a large waitstaff, so dishes are cleared away promptly, but we were not rushed. our section filled up towards the latter half of the meal, but the staff were able to keep up with no problems.\n\nif you're a fan of this type of japanese food, check it out - it's pricey, but you're in vegas, so live a little!", 
            "when nobu opened in new york city, it created a sensation.  reservations were nearly impossible to get, and its new interpretation of traditional japanese food was widely praised.  this led to the inevitable branding of the restaurant; nobu can be found all over the globe.\n\nmeal #1: i found las vegas nobu's sushi highly variable.  the overall quality was ok, but some items (e.g., uni) were poor while others (e.g., ankimo) were good.  orange and honey flavored sake was interesting but probably not worth repeating.\n\n\nmeal #2:  since my first meal, i went to nobu in miami beach, sat in the dining room and had the omakase meal.  i enjoyed that a bit more, so decided to give the vegas location another shot.\n\nthe restaurant looks ok, but nothing great.  it's very noisy, in keeping with the hard rock atmosphere.  the crowd is mostly young, but i think anyone would feel comfortable here; i did.  service is pleasant, although all the servers are running around at full speed.\n\nnow, on to the meal:\n\n    * i chose jyunmai daiginjyo sake.  it wasn't bad, but was a trifle harsh.\n    * small japanese spring roll with balsamic vinaigrette reduction.  good.\n    * trio of raw seafood: sea scallop slice, oyster, ama ebi (raw shrimp).  all served with onion and other spices, although each was slightly different.  good.\n    * seared maguro and a slightly strong flavored fish, <mark>Squid 'Pasta' with Light Garlic</mark> chips and a pickled ginger shoot.  a good combination.  very good.\n    * uni (<mark>Sea Urchin</mark>) <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> white fish, served on sliced eggplant.  the uni was seared and was surprisingly delicious.  there was also a tiny river crab, to be eaten shell and all; interesting for the crunch, not the flavor.  very good.\n    * o toro and a spring roll <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> sauce and radish.  the o toro was good but a little chewy, and the strong sauce tended to overwhelm the tuna.  good to very good.\n    * palate cleanser: intensely flavored, sweet/sour mango sorbet, on top of a red granite with little flavor.\n    * service lapse.  up to this point, courses had been timed well.  at this point, i waited for about 15 minutes, with no explanation.  this was a little annoying.\n    * grilled sea scallop on a bed of mushrooms, bits of seafood, and brown rice.  very good.\n    * <mark>Teppan Style Foie Gras</mark> and kobe beef.  a large hunk of <mark>Teppan Style Foie Gras</mark>; good flavor.  kobe beef very good.  overall, very good to excellent.\n    * service lapse: the next course was supposed to be sushi, followed by <mark><mark>Lobster <mark>Miso Soup</mark></mark></mark>.  they reversed the order, and apologized later.  a minor matter.\n    * <mark><mark>Lobster <mark>Miso Soup</mark></mark></mark>.  better than average; good fish stock flavor, not too salty.  very good.\n    * sushi: o-toro (tuna belly), <mark>Shima Aji</mark> (variety of mackerel?), some kind of crab, unagi (eel).  very good.\n    * fruit papillote.  like a crepe.  the raspberry seeds were very distracting.  fair.\n    * honey <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark>.  very strong honey flavor.  strange, but i liked it.  very good.\n\noverall, the meal was good, but not as good as nobu in miami, and not nearly as good as okada.  at the price they charge ($120), they need to do better.\n\n\nmeal #3: based on past meals, i hadn't planned to return. however, i found myself at the hard rock hotel at meal time, and no other choices looked appealing. i decided to go for unusual choices, hoping this would be a strength. this worked out better. my selections:\n\n    * ankimo (steamed monkfish liver). standard but still very good.\n    * <mark>Hamachi Kama</mark> (grilled yellowtail collar). this is a chunk of fish, skin and bone, served grilled. it may not sound like much, and it's a little difficult to get the flesh out, but it's usually very rich and very tasty. i was both happy and sad with my choice: it was very good, but not as good as elsewhere. if you'd like to try this dish, order it robatayaki style at okada.\n    * live shrimp. these santa barbara shrimp were killed in front of me, so i guess that means they're fresh. they were big and rather chewy; i'm guessing the latter is due to their recent demise. the heads were served tempura style, and were juicy and tasty.\n    * live octopus. i'm not sure that it was live, but slices of the tentacle, served raw, were indeed very fresh tasting - and much less chewy than the cooked version. pretty good.\n\nthis was the most satisfying of my meals at nobu. nothing was stellar, but everything was good.\n\n\n\nnobu's strength is its new take on japanese foods.  its weaknesses are sushi that isn't in the same class with the better places in las vegas, and suspect service.  given such high prices, i'd look elsewhere.",

            "i've heard various friends praise los angeles's nobu over the years, so after my girlfriend ran the las vegas marathon this weekend, we decided to celebrate <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> first-class sushi.\n\nwe had reservations at 9:00 pm, and we were seated promptly (actually ahead of time, which was nice). my first impression of the restaurant was that it was extremely loud (we were there on a tuesday night), and its location in the hard rock hotel made me groan (it's a bit out of the way, and not necessarily a place i want to poke around).\n\nour waiter, justin, was initially very prompt with our drink orders, but it took 10 minutes (and a reminder) to get glasses of water, and another 10 to get <mark><mark>Lobster <mark>Miso Soup</mark></mark></mark>.\n\nour first course was only half right (we got two dishes, but one was not what we ordered). the servers apologized and took it away. at the rate they were bringing out our food, though, we shuddered to think how long it would take them to bring out the correct dish. for<mark>Tuna (Big Eye)</mark>, it was corrected quickly.\n\nwhen our sushi came out, we noticed another mistake: the <mark>Spicy Miso Chips <mark>Nobu Crispy Rice with Big Eye Tuna</mark> or <mark>Scallop</mark></mark> had been mistakenly replaced with a second order of <mark>Spicy Tuna (Big Eye)</mark>. again, we told them it was wrong and again, they corrected the mistake rather quickly.\n\nservice got to be so bad that after asking a server to hail our waiter (and subsequently having the request ignored), we decided to get the manager over to our table. we were 30 seconds from getting up and leaving (she took another 5 minutes to get to the table) when she came over and heard our story. she seemed as interested in our plight as any manager should and agreed to comp some of our dishes, which was nice.\n\nstill, however, justin's service through the entire night was abysmal (i think we saw him 3 times over an hour and a half), and no amount of manager treatment could save the tip.\n\nregarding the food, it was ok. the <mark><mark>Lobster <mark>Miso Soup</mark></mark></mark> was great. the <mark>Spicy Tuna (Big Eye)</mark> and scallop rolls were anything but (very mild), and the hot/cold mixture of the tuna tempura rolls was a little strange. it was good, but the temperature difference was one of those things that made me wonder, \"is this supposed to be this way and i'm an idiot for thinking this, or is something actually wrong with how it was made?\" judging by the fact that the tuna tempura rolls were one of the dishes they got wrong initially, it could have been that they rushed the order and made it worse. either way, i wasn't really in love with it.\n\nfor the price i [would have] paid, i can't say that the las vegas nobu is really worth it for me again. i've had much better sushi in oakland, for much less.", 
            "nobu is my favorite japanese restaurant.  ever.  so far i've been to three- this one, nobu malibu and nobu 57 in ny.  out of the three, i'd have to say ny was the best and this one the least-best.  i say \"least best\" because \"worst\" and nobu don't belong in the same sentence together.  you cant go wrong with nobu- but i did have a few gripes about my most recent experience here a couple days ago.\n\nso, of course of course you have to get the miso cod, obvie...not going to spend time describing how fabulous that dish is. in <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> to the cod, i also ordered the lychee martini, the miso eggplant, the <mark>Hearts of Palm</mark> salad with \"jalapeno\" dressing and a <mark><mark>Lobster <mark>Miso Soup</mark></mark></mark>.  if you've read my nobu 57 review, you can see that the lychee martini i had was perfect (which is why i had 3), so understandably i was excited to have it again.  however, the one i received at nobu vegas was waaaaay to strong, and i had to request <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> lychee juice to balance out the rubbing alcohol taste.  my other major gripe was the <mark>Hearts of Palm</mark> salad.  i specifically went out of my way to ask the server if this salad was the same <mark>Hearts of Palm</mark> salad <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> dressing they serve at nobu 57, and he assured me it was.  wrong.  that salad that came out was repulsive- and pretty offensive because of the over-the-top garlic used.  it tasted nothing like the marvelous h.o.p. salad at nobu 57.  and, they should call it \"blast of garlic dressing\" because after one bite i swear i smelled wretchedly of garlic for the rest of the night- and it wasn't spicy from the jalapeno at all.  oh, and not to mention the fact that it was twenty dollars.  um, yea...skip that one.  the miso eggplant was good- not remarkable, but we did eat every last bit of it.\n\nso, even with my complaints i still believe its a 4-star worthy establishment because every one of my previous experiences here have been amazing.  maybe not as good as nobu 57, but still the best japanese restaraunt in vegas, definitely.", 
            "very very good. hard to say that it lived up to the hype, but i thought the omakase was good value for $100. i went with my parents and they also ordered the omakase. the waiter tempted us with the $150 omakase containing \"dishes not on the menu\", but being our first time at nobu, we went with the cheaper omakase. the dishes (as best as i can remember from my pics), in order: (cold-hot-sushi-soup-dessert)\n\n1) toro with spicy miso and caviar - wow, definitely one of the highlights of the omakase. super juicy, melt-in-your-mouth toro topped with a bit of caviar and sitting in a nice spicy miso sauce. omg so good. there was an interesting tiny japanese peach on the side to cleanse the palate.\n\n2) hawaiian <mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> sashimi - very nice texture and mix of flavors with the a citrus sauce, spot of spicy sauce, a sprinkle of black sea salt, and . not sure if it's on the regular menu, maybe it's called something else.\n\n3) kampachi and <mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> sashimi - super exotic and tasty. i didn't even know what kampachi was until i looked it up. apparently it's hawaiian yellowtail farmed in the open ocean off the kona coast of the big island. the trout was also very good. it looks a bit like salmon, but tastes a lot better. served with a nice miso-based sauce (i think) on the side, a couple small veggie sushi rolls, a roasted jalapeno, and a small, yellow, pear-shaped tomato sliced in half.\n\n4) black cod w/ miso - this dish really did live up to the hype. i was about to order it separately in case it did not come with the omakase, but our waiter said it is normally included in the $100 omakase since it's a very popular dish. omg so good. such delicate flavors and texture. amazing. i normally don't like to eat fish skin, but this skin is super good and flavorful. the cod is very light and flaky, but not dry. wow, this is a must try if you come to nobu.\n\n5) beef tenderloin w/ shiitake mushroom <mark>Tuna (Big Eye) and Asparagus</mark> - i didn't think this was that special and probably would not order off the regular menu. it was very good tenderloin though, cooked to a perfect medium rare, with a light sauce. it is served in a sizzling mini cast iron plate.\n\n6) nigiri sushi platter - delicious nigiri, super fresh, and most pieces i normally wouldn't order myself, but were interesting to try. tuna (best i've had in awhile), <mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark>, aji, giant clam, and sweet shrimp. mmm\n\n7) <mark><mark>Lobster <mark>Miso Soup</mark></mark></mark> w/ clams - pretty standard <mark><mark>Lobster <mark>Miso Soup</mark></mark></mark> with a few clams inside. the clams and miso is a good combination, but they can be tricky to fish out and eat with only chopsticks. i cheated on one of them and used two fingers to hold the shell. ;p\n\n8) flourless chocolate cake w/ green tea <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark> - a generous portion served in a cute <mark>Bento Box</mark>. nothing too spectacular or interesting, but delicious nonetheless. the cake was still nice and molten inside when it arrived. yum!\n\na pretty filling flight of dishes for $100. i thought it was good value to try many dishes, but i haven't seen the sizes of the normal dishes. many tables around us also ordered the omakase, as i heard the same descriptions being recited by the staff over and over. i over heard a table of french tourists behind us ordering california rolls, chicken teriyaki, tempura, and other generic stuff you can get anywhere. sigh, what a waste.\n\ni would recommend not to order anything not on the \"hot\" of \"cold\" specialty pages of the menu. the rest is basically traditional japanese fare you can get anywhere, but will probably taste better and cost a lot more at nobu. service was good, polite, and attentive. it was a bit odd when our waiter brought out the first few dishes, and then a couple other different guys brought out some of the following ones. weird.\n\nthe decor is basic, but nothing too special. the sushi bar looks cool and there's a pretty wall of bamboo poles at the back as you walk in. my parents like to eat early, so we moved our reservation to 6pm when they are supposed to open. when we arrived a few minutes early, the door was locked and they didn't seem ready yet. ten minutes later, they were ready. better to come early though, or your omakase may take two hours or longer to get through. ours took about 90 minutes because it wasn't that crowded until after 7.\n\ni think the tenderloin and dessert could have been better and more creative. otherwise, nearly flawless.\n\nif i ever return for a special occasion, i will definitely need to try the $150 omakase. with the economy in shambles, i kinda feel bad eating such an expensive dinner. for<mark>Tuna (Big Eye)</mark>, my parents picked up the tab tonight as i had paid last night at the painted pony. maybe in 2009 they will have a recession special, like gray's papaya. ;p", 
            "yes, i'm a sushi lover and this place...honestly took my breath away. i was here during ces 2009 for work and my manager and i got invited to dinner with one of our partners at this restaurant. this place was packed when we showed up. the sake was amazing, even though i couldn't take much of it down since i had alcohol poisoning that morning ;p, yeah i know...i party hard even when i'm at work. but yes, the cod was intensely amazing and the <mark><mark>Lobster <mark>Miso Soup</mark></mark></mark> was quite awesome as well...definitely gonna hit this place up again when i'm in town.",

            "my buddy and i went to nobu this past friday night at 9:30 for their omasake chef choice tasting menu. we had very few disappointments. they sat us right away at the bar, tables would have been 15 minutes even with our reservations.  lots of good energy in the restaurant, lots of japanese yelling back and forth from the waiters and sushi chefs.  we split a $50 bottle of nonfiltered very fragrant nigori sake cold which was smooth and easy to drink. the small bits of rice at the bottle of the bottle reminded me of red wine sediment as a good thing. \n\nthe first course came out quick and cold. a chilled patty of toro tartar in a soy wasabi sauce topped <mark>Yellowtail or Salmon <mark>Blue Fin <mark>Toro Tartare</mark> with Royal Ossetra Caviar</mark></mark>, served with a baby silver spoon.  it was tender, smooth, rich and melt in your mouth.  the caviar was not memorable.  an a+ start and an expensive dish on their regular menu. next was 4 pieces per plate of thin cut fresh octopus topped with a cilantro leaf, a dot of super hot sauce, finished with citrus, like ceviche.  pretty good.  next was another cold appetizer of rice paper wrapped greens with a piece of raw ebi sweet shrimp, dressed with a fantastic sesame ginger sauce with a fried prawn head on the side.  my buddy especially liked the tempura batter on the <mark>Sweet Shrimp with Fried Head</mark> and the dressing.  i will personally come to your house and kill you if you do not eat the fried prawn head. \n\nthen started the hot plates.  first was the ever famous <mark>Black Cod Miso</mark> cod, a bit too sweet for my buddy but it did not keep us from both licking the plates.  a small piece of tender fish which just went on and on and kept melting in our mouths.  flavor of fish hard to come through past miso and sweetness.  like fish candy in a good way.  my friend said that an improvement would be to torch and crisp up the skin before putting on the sauce which would give some texture contrast and make the dish over the top.  $23 on the regular menu.  next was the beef tenderloin toban yaki style with a shitake and enokitake mushrooms and a piece of thin asparagus in a soy broth. beef very lean, not as melt in your mouth as i would like.  my buddy would have liked a nice piece of ribeye cap instead but who wouldn't.  the dish is served spitting hot on a mini hot plate and when they raise the cover in front of you, the steam envelopes you warmly.  try not to get the grease on you. \n\nnext was the nigiri sushi course of 5 pieces along with a nice clam <mark><mark>Lobster <mark>Miso Soup</mark></mark></mark>. we got a piece of <mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> (mmmm), magura tuna (so tender), yellowtail (yum), clam (a bit tough) and <mark>Sea Eel</mark> which was the most tender fall apart <mark>Sea Eel</mark> i have ever tasted.  the sushi rice <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> fill you to the gills by that point and then they hit you with the dessert which was a bento presentation of a warm flowerless chocolate lava cake with lots of lava and very little cake and a very good not sweet green tea <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark>.   this just put the nail in the coffin.  we were stuffed, but we couldn't stop eating since it was so good.  \n\nthe restaurant closed at 11pm on a friday night, but we will remember the meal for a long time coming.  next time i'm in vegas i plan to make it a point to return and see what the chef choice is at that point in time.  this was the $100 omasake.  the $150 would have <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> some kobe beef and <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> and there.  we were very happy with our choice.  i think the meal was an absolute bargain for the price.", 
            "not worth the hype. \n\nnobu isn't a japanese restaurant, it's a new age sushi restaurant. they may have borrowed their name from new york, but that's about where the similarities end. \n\nservice was friendly, but brisk. they clearly wanted to get us in and out of there since we were sitting at the bar. \n\nwe ordered <mark><mark>Lobster <mark>Miso Soup</mark></mark></mark>, the four <mark>Kelp Salad</mark> (their version of a seaweed salad), tamago, the chilean sea bass with a dried miso sauce, and chicken teriyaki. the miso was standard, and the tamago was much larger than what i'm used to, but both were good. <mark>Kelp Salad</mark> was a little too fishy for me, but then again, i had my heart set on seaweed salad. both the chilean sea bass and the chicken teriyaki were merely good, but not good enough for the ticket ($45 and $30 respectively) and neither came with rice.\n\nso why the three stars? we just weren't overwhelmed. nobu wasn't an impressive dining experience, and in this town, if you don't have experience, why bother?", 
            "this would have been four stars, but the inner kitchen made a serious error.  the decor was natural, grounding, with a slightly modern twist.  the restaurant was too loud, but the noise was voices and the casino a bit.  it would have been much better if it wasn't so loud and you could concentrate on the food.  \n\ni ordered the specialty tasting menu which is a seven course meal that is over a hundred dollars.  i made it known to my server that i eat \"kosher style only fish that have scales and fins, when alive e.g., salmon, tuna, white fish, etc, no shell fish under any circumstances, lard, red meat, or gelatin unless it is seaweed gelatin.\"   \n\nthe hors d'oeuvres, salad, and specialty roles were amazing!  they told stories in my mouth and gave me a unique and exhilarating experience. the warm dishes were good, but the specialty rolls are so much better.  stay away from the basic sashmi and regular rolls.  it wasn't worth it for the price.   \n\nthe fiasco really started when i was given <mark><mark>Lobster <mark>Miso Soup</mark></mark></mark> with shells in it!  that type of error should not happen.  it was a mistake in the kitchen, but the manager was very lucky that i was not allergic.  while she apologized, and asked how she could make it right.  i had to suggest a discount.  i think that it should have been immediately offered.  to the manager's credit she did ask if i had a shell fish allergy, and she did go immediately to talk to the kitchen, but that kind of error is inexcusable to me.  this is especially true given how much i stressed no shell fish and how severe shell fish allergies can be.", 
            "came here during restaurant week. i love the modern, sleek d\\u00e9cor which reminds you of the flagship house in la. \n\nokay, now the food. let me know just preface this by saying, this place should not tote itself as a japanese restaurant because most people should realize, this isn't. sure, it's got sushi and stuff but no dice. if you can move past that, then you may enjoy this place.\n\ntuna tataki -this is good. lightly seared but has a good taste to it\n<mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> -i'm not a fan of spicy but this does <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> nice kick to the yellowtail.\n<mark>Black Cod Miso</mark> - this was surprisingly really good. the fish was cooked wonderfully; just the right amount of crisp but moist/juicy flavor to it. \nassorted sushi -this is the most standard dish that you can get at any sushi joint, for 1/8 the price.\n<mark><mark>Lobster <mark>Miso Soup</mark></mark></mark> -i'm only commenting about this because i love how they call it \"sipping soup\" so at first you think you're getting something special...only to realize it's <mark><mark>Lobster <mark>Miso Soup</mark></mark></mark>.\nmochi was pretty delicious but i'm sure this was purchased at your local trader joes or mitsuwa.\n\nanyhow, it's worth stopping by to check out the d\\u00e9cor and if it's restaurant week. i would consider this place asian fusion more than japanese but eh, if you're craving asian food and you're staying at the hard rock, this is gonna be your best (and only) bet.", 
            "nobu should <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> letters to the end of its name: e-n-o.  \n\nthe food here tastes better than mcdonald's but worse than chipotle, but i would rate mcdonald's higher due to it being a better value.  we had the tasting menu <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> sushi.  the <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark>, along with every other cold dish, followed the same formula: raw fish + cilantro hidden underneath a pile of salt. the black cod <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark> and the beef tenderloin tasted like bad halloween candy.  everything was either drenched in salt or drenched in sugar, or both.  the sushi was not inedible, it was on par with the kind of sushi you can get from any two-dollar-sign sushi restaurant.  it's pretty hard to mess up sushi to the extent that they messed up their other dishes, since chefs have less artistic license when it comes to sushi.  then again, it's hard to mess up <mark><mark>Lobster <mark>Miso Soup</mark></mark></mark> and theirs was the worst i've ever had (way too salty).  service was good.  \n\nour bill, including tip, came out to nearly $600 for three people.  so if you want to trick your non-asian friends into believing that their palates lack the sophistication to appreciate expensive asian cuisine, nobu is the place to go.  or sometimes when you're feeling masochistic, you just want to get punched in the face.  that's when you go to nobu.  \n\nthere are many reasons to go to nobu, but edible food is not among them.  if you want good food, there are some great french options in the area, such as le cirque.", 
            "simply amazing best ever!!!   i struggled to give it 5 stars, i think i would call this a 4.5 star rating.   its a little overpriced for what it is, they need to do more food, i left hungry.  that shouldnt happen.  service 98 out of 100.  food 95 out of 100  value 80 out of 100.   i think it was a little overpriced, but the quality was totally there!   i would definitely go again, and i think i would love it again, but it let me down just a little, after hearing all the hype.   i could go here once , or go to sushi mon 4 times, all i can eat, you know my choice on that one if i want sushi 4 times!   \n\nafter the sticker shock, which i didnt pay so i dont care what it costs, the food was insanely good.  we had the saki, beers, and a feast of sashimi, shrimp, <mark><mark>Lobster <mark>Miso Soup</mark></mark></mark>, and rolls.   my favorite was the lettuce wrapped black cod, oh my god, this was the best fish bite i have ever had.  it melted in your mouth like butter from the fat and the protein - i am not sure if it was oil pan fried, or what, it was hot, but not too hot, but it had a little sizzle on it, and the glazed oil on it just <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> to the silky flavor.  i would go back there just for that!   the desert was a rhubarb molten love with <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark> over it, talk about yummy!   tasted like strawberries to me, but it was perfect, i would have taken one more scoop <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark>, next time i will ask.   i am sure they would accommodate.     5 star food at 5 star prices.    \n\ndecor was a little drab to me, i dont know what it was, it was classy, but too dark, the bamboo was nice, but i think they could use some live fish tank in the place, maybe i missed something, the walkway in was nice, but the dining room was a little drab for me.  i think a splash of color would have been nice.   anyway, i am nitpicking now and thats not fair to them.    quality stuff, incredible food, great dining room, great location at hard rock.  highly recommended.  please bring your wallet, or someone elses, you will need it!     also, be prepared for a late night snack later meal after, unless you are on a diet.    4.5 star overall, i likey!",

            "we planned to have dinner with our friends who live in vegas on one night of our two night stay there recently. after scouring the restaurant recommendations from my friend, we decided on nobu. sometimes i have to be in the mood for sushi, i don't always crave it like other people i know, so i was worrying about committing to a reservation. i was also worried about having to pay a million dollars (slight exageration; i don't even have a million dollars, and if i did, i would only spend half on wine) for any good wine. (true story, i made the mistake of ordering a glass of wine at the bar in the casino at the flamingo (don't ask) one night and it had me wishing for manischewitz.)\n\nok - back to the matter at hand: nobu has now made me crave sashimi, sushi and all japanese food all the time. not only did the server rattle off, in detail, and totally and completely from her memory, just about every item listed on the menu, but the food was amazing. i die. we had a smattering of everything from each \"category\" and honestly, went a bit overboard, but it was a meal well worth going over board on. \n\nwe dined on:\n\n-edamame\n-<mark><mark>Lobster <mark>Miso Soup</mark></mark></mark>\n-tempura fried rock shrimp <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> type of delicious citrusy, creamy sauce\n-<mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> (out of this world)\n-red <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark> (also, amazing)\n-salmon <mark>White Fish <mark>Scallop <mark>Salmon <mark>Oyster <mark>Beef <mark>Yuba Sashimi New Style</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark> sashimi, which was lightly seared and served with green onion, absolutely delicious\n-<mark>Soft Shell Crab</mark> roll\n-spicy <mark>Big Eye Tuna Roll</mark> (cause, come on, you gotta round out the meal)\n\nthe dessert was good but unremarkable. i'm more about the main event.\n\ncap that <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> amazing gin cocktail that i now forget the name of and two glasses of hellaciously expensive, but delicious, sauvignon blanc, and this is one of the top meals i have had in my little life thus far... \n\nin short, take your gambling winnings to nobu and order everything the server suggests.", 
            "service at nobu is always par none! paired with my favorite standbys here...yellowtail sashimi with jalape\\u00f1o!!!! this dish is a signature and is undeniably one of my favorites in the world. super tender and the perfect combination of savory and perfect kick from the fresh jalape\\u00f1o! the rock shrimp are just amazing with a creamy sauce and again with a perfect bite at the finish. our server offered a variation of my favorite <mark>Black Cod Miso</mark> cod- small portions served on butter lettuce cups that rocked so much i ordered a second. \n\nfor our special adventure we opted for the <mark>Hearts of Palm</mark> pasta- again a kick and for me interesting but not a fav yet clarence loved it! last and should have been first was their <mark><mark>Lobster <mark>Miso Soup</mark></mark></mark>- probably the best anywhere , served piping hot and i enjoy it as a finish. \n\nthe wagyu beef was so tempting but i passed. it is hard for me to order a dish equivalent to two new pairs of shoes... honestly we have never been disappointed in a nobu splurge. i was pretty full before the table next to us ordered it and caused me to have food envy but there is always next time. \n\naaron was a super knowledgable and very attentive. the team of secondary servers were all on point. huge kudus to the whole team here from start to finish with a standing o for the chef and kitchen too!", 
            "over priced food that is just totally made up. considering who amd what nobu is, this place is truely a disappointment. service in general is okay but food comes out in the strangest order.\n\nthe 2 times ive been here ive had my order arrive last and everyone is waiting in me. considering what i order should come first, its amazing how im last to get any food.\n\nmy most recent visit i had an order of <mark><mark>Lobster <mark>Miso Soup</mark></mark></mark> which i had to asl for 4 times and didnt arrive until we paid the bill.\n\ndont be fooled by the name. this place is certainly low standard versus any other high cost food place.\n\nthe food itself is nothing special and looks rushed as if the kitchen just cares about turning food out.", 
            "this is by far the worst nobu i have ever been to.  i've been to numerous nobu's around the world.  my wife and i ordered the chefs tasting omakase, and was very dissatisfied.  one of the plates brought out was <mark><mark>Lobster <mark>Miso Soup</mark></mark></mark> and another a regular plate of tuna and salmon sushi- not even toro.  my bill was close to $500 btw.  stay far away from this nobu.  the quality and ambiance of this place doesn't deserve to be called a nobu franchise restaurant.  there are 2 other nobu's in vegas that are better than this place i'm sure.", 
            "i came back four years later and this place is still so good! so good that i went twice in one week which is very unusual for me especially with all the great places vegas has to offer. the items that stuck out for me were the <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> (simple but omg all the flavors work so well together...and that sauce that it comes with is delicious), <mark>Salmon / Salmon Belly</mark>,  <mark>Black Cod Miso</mark>, <mark>Nobu Crispy Rice with Big Eye Tuna</mark>, <mark><mark>Lobster <mark>Miso Soup</mark></mark></mark>, and the kronuts! and the service was absolutely impeccable!"

            "when i criticized morimoto napa for being like a \"vegas restaurant,\" i now realize i was astral-projecting into the future and referring to this one.  chef nobu has a signature, peruvian-influenced style, and it seems to be coupling proper technique and great ingredients with a bunch of overpowering and discordant flavors.\n\nuni tempura is amazingly good, although the price ($16 for one piece) and the questionable accompaniments (the obligatory deep-fried shiso leaf) put it far down the value-for-money l<mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark>.\n\nthe tataki plates of kobe-\"style\" beef are great and totally worth the price.  they're an especially great maneuver for large parties, since the steak is so thinly sliced it's easily shared.\n\nking crab tempura is nicely made but there's way too much acid from the ponzu.\n\nthe same goes for the <mark><mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> Salad</mark>; it's far too acidic, the flavor of the <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> lost.  but the pasta aspect was nice; great texture.\n\nthe black cod <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark> is probably a reverse of the chef's intentions:  it's really miso with black cod.  miso is a tricky ingredient; in this dish it's just completely overpowering; it seems like approach is to simply rub the miso on directly.  that's a risky tactic and it doesn't really pay off; it was hard to get through more than a few bites.  and i *love* miso.\n\nmaki in its various forms are served with -- incredibly -- a side of ponzu sauce.  that's a first for me.  i'm not sure i get the logic behind it.  the special house rolls e.g. with jalape\\u00f1o are tasty enough, but generally the <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> flavors don't complement the fish very well.\n\nthe sushi itself is perfectly made.  the knife work <mark><mark>XO and Jamon Iberico</mark> <mark>Beef <mark>Crab Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> preparation and rolling are impeccable.\n\nnobu is a bit flashy and it's to be expected from a restaurant chain that's co-owned by a celebrity chef and an actual movie star.  it's also to be expected from las vegas.  \n\ni'd certainly recommend nobu for the more traditional fare:  it's essentially authentic and very well-made.  i don't think i'd recommend much beyond that.  japanese cuisine, being one of the greatest in the world, doesn't need fixing or innovation.  nor does it need an <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> side of ponzu sauce.", 
            "unbelievable meal. would not recommend getting sushi here the cooked dishes are definitely the way to go. sushi was pretty standard but very expensive.  i was not wowed by the quality of the fish and considering the price i think there are better spots for sushi.  the fried snapper, chili paste and truffle oil edamame, hamachi <mark>King Crab with Amazu Ponzu</mark> sauce,  and <mark>Crab <mark><mark>XO and Jamon Iberico</mark> <mark>Beef <mark>Crab Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark></mark> balls with <mark>Spicy Tuna (Big Eye)</mark>. were some of my favorite dishes.",

            "matsuhisa nobu, i salute you! your food is divine. i am jealous of your restaurant's decor. i envy your river stone wall. i wish i was a celebrity so i wouldn't have to wait so damn long to eat in your wickedly awesome dining establishment! i simultaneously loathe and love you...in a platonic sort of way, of course...\n\nnobu (in the hard rock hotel & casino) is one of my all-time favorite restaurants. i've also been to matsuhisa's in los angeles, but there's nothing like the nobu experience. it's vegas baby!!\n\nanyway, i've found that it's so much easier to make reservations at nobu if you're actually staying in the hotel (which is awesome, by the way). one of my college roommates' sisters used to work there and hooked me up with a discounted suite on two occasions...score! it also doesn't help if you're pretty slick with the pass-the-twenty-as-you-shake-the-host/hostess'-hand-in-order-to-get-a-table-faster bit. never worked for me...kept dropping the money...\n\nback to the food: pricey? abso-friggin'-lutely! take one look at the place. nice furniture, kitschy bamboo sake bottles and cups, rice paper wall paneling, indoor bamboo plants, wall inlaid with black river stones, huge sushi bar, and you mustn't forget about the main ingredient: location, location, location. the hard rock is practically a sure-fire way to keep this place packed with gorgeous-looking people. they need some way to pay the rent, right?\n\nbut is the food tasty? hells to the yeah, it is! every single dish i've ever had here has been delicious...even the ones that i'm usually not too keen on were better than other places (mirugai for example: here = tasty; other sushi places = like chewing on a salted piece of bicycle tire). the sea bass is prepared very well (nice and moist, flaky too), the rock shrimp is fried to perfection, the sashimi is beautifully presented, and the tataki is to die for...*sigh* if only i could be there right now... their <mark>Dessert</mark> are just as good as their appetizers and entrees. the last time i was there they had a passion fruit sorbet that could knock you out with its incredible flavor (oooh...my mouth's watering just thinking about it...and now i've drooled on my keyboard...how embarrassing...).\n\nas i mentioned before, this place can get pricey. but, if you have the funds and the stomach for it, you have to go with the omakase (chef's choice). tip: let your server know what you're partial to and what doesn't exactly float your boat in the food department (i'm not a big fan of uni (<mark>Sea Urchin</mark>), so i let 'em know that...thanks nobu!). i believe there are different levels to the omakase dinner, too...at least there was the last time i visited. but, if omakase's not the thing for you, go a la carte...that way you can try a variety of nobu's offerings. it's all up to you.\n\nsince nobu's in a vegas hot-spot, be prepared for celebrity sightings as well. the first time i ate there, my wife and i were seated next to a group of porn stars (they had to be with their excessively tight and skimpy clothing, the gratuitous cleavage (both male and female), the over-tanned, near-leather quality to their skin, and (of course) the cowboy hats!) c'mon! who wears a cowboy hat in a japanese restaurant while wearing practically nothing?! porn stars! that's who! i also walked past ex-san francisco 49er quarterback jeff garcia, kansas city chiefs tight end tony gonzalez, enrique iglesias, and enrique iglesias' mole (pre-divorce, that is).\n\nevery visit to nobu is like dinner and a show! i think that alone gives me my money's worth.", 
            "believe it or not, i think nobu vegas stands out as the best nobu venue in the u.s. i've done the omakatse menu (degustation) several times, and each time, it has been almost totally different, with each course being innovative, surprising, and most importantly, delicious. while kobe beef may be hard to mess up (though certainly not impossible :p), nobu delivers it perfectly in several different preparations. from tartar, to seared fillet, to wok fried, it's always decadent and flavorful. the sushi is ridiculously fresh and well presented, as are the salads and <mark>Dessert</mark>. the staff does just an amazing job describing every ingredient in every course in great detail, explaining where everything is grown, what flavors it's chosen for, and it's history. simply amazing. \n\ntheir sake list is diverse and excellent, and nobu has the best cold sakes i've ever had. i've had the chance to have some blind horizontal tastings, and yk-35 always wound up as being my favorite.",

(i don't think i've ever typed a longer word than \"unenthusiastically\").\n\nthe black cod <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark> was the highlight. the kobe beef was amazing too but we all misread the menu and when that showed up at $192 i'd call it hands down the most overpriced thing i've ever eaten. the <mark>Scallop</mark> topped <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> were the third great dish. the sushi was fine though nothing spectacular.\n\nthe ambiance is surprisingly boring, especially for vegas. it looks the way a japanese restaurant might if designed by the high-school drama department - all cheap bamboo reeds and sloppy wood structures. and the service, though efficient, was humorless. any waitress who can't understand the genius in asking if there are any beef-based <mark>Dessert</mark> off the menu is not winning any points with me.\n\nstill, the price minus the kobe was totally reasonable, especially for vegas. and the matsuhisa martinis go a long way toward <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> up to a pretty good meal.", 
            "i don't know about the ny or la counterparts, but......\n\nnobu lv must be the biggest scam in the history of fine dining.  i really wanted to like it because i didn't want to seem like a hater but seriously the decor is so uninspired (surfboards, bamboo, modern-classic clash) and the wait staff doesn't have the same refined elegance or grace as comparably priced restaurants.  just cuz you put on a black t-shirt and black slacks doesn't make it chic and modern -- unless you're steve jobs.\n\nwe had the <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> which was genius -- at least for the accountants.  the live scallop was sour and spicy but just too much of each.  the moi new sashimi special could have been any fish.  the miso cod was tasty and one of the highlights, but was served lukewarm.  the uni tempura dish was also pretty good but you only get 1 piece of uni.  the <mark>Bento Box</mark> and yuzu wasabi <mark>Dessert</mark> were ok too.\n\nwould i dine there if the food was 1/3 the price?  sure.  i just felt like i was getting duped and i wanted to scream out the king ain't wearing any clothes you idiots.  but then i realized between the loud noise of hard rock and the drunken stupor of the crowd , my efforts would be moot.", 
            "ate at nobu in vegas last night and what an amazing experience we had.  we had the omakase experience, started with cold dishes to warm entree to heavy appetizer and finished off with a few of their special <mark>Dessert</mark>.  starters: <mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> sashimi with dried miso, olive oil and yuzu; <mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> and cilantro; <mark>Scallop</mark> and <mark>Black Cod Miso</mark> lettuce wraps; pink snapper with pineapple and tomatoes. for warm dishes: chilean sea bass <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> crust and <mark>Tenderloin of Beef</mark> braised <mark>Kumamoto Oyster with <mark>Bone in Ribeye 24oz Nobu Sauce</mark></mark> on a bed of south american yam; <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark> presented in 3 different sauces.  to finish off the meal, chelf sent a platter of 4 special <mark>Dessert</mark>.  always make room for dessert!!!", 
            "okay. amazing. got omakase, but not just omakase....\n\ndebated going here since we're vegans... thought i might have fish for the first time in over 4 years then decided against it and canceled our reservations. but then the night we stayed in the hard rock hotel and walked by the joint?.... well.... here's how it went down:\n\nwe stopped to just check out the menu to see what veg options were even available. the hostess and host were wondering what we were contemplating and why... we told them that we were veg and everyone at the hostess station said 'no problem!! come in, vegetarians here all the time!!'... but then we followed that up with 'well, we're actually vegans.....' to which one waiter said 'let me check with the chef, i'll be right back.' \n\napparently the kitchen 'wanted the challenge'.... so in we went!\n\nsat down and decided to order the omakase meal. usually this consists of six plates plus dessert but we actually got eight and two <mark>Dessert</mark> (one each, two different <mark>Dessert</mark>)... can i say amazing?! the food that the kitchen came up with was amazing. we actually were stuffed by the time the sixth course of food came around (and we thought last!) but two more came. by the time dessert was served we didn't think we could fit anymore into our stomachs. but we \"managed\" :)\n\nfood, service, everything was impeccable. def would highly recommend a visit. worth every penny!! very impressed with what they came up with for us as well.", 
            "seriously delicious!  the first time i went to a sushi place and didn't have any rolls or rice!  we didn't order but had the waiter bring out their best dishes and everything was absolutely amazing!  the cod wraps and crab and rockshrimp were my favorite as well as their signature <mark>Yellowtail and Jalapeno</mark> dish.  they put together a spread of their <mark>Dessert</mark>, so got a little taste of everything.  oh and had the best riesling ever!  i will post pictures of their best dishes!\n\nand even though the chef was busy, he did come out to greet us which was really nice!\n\ni would highly recommend and want to go back!", 
            "i came here for dinner with a large group, and they never gave us a hard time about last minute changes on the size of the group. \n\nour waiter was attentive, patient, and gave great recommendations, and it was easy to get helped, even though we were seated allll the way in the back of the restaurant. \n\ni had the <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> and the miso cod, and between all the folks at our table, i tasted a pretty good portion of the menu, including <mark>Dessert</mark>, and nothing was bad. \n\nwhen i go back, i'm getting the <mark>Colorado Lamb Chops</mark> or the miso cod. can't wait. vegas anyone?", 
            "best meal ever!!!! came here for my friends bachlorette party since it was being paid for by another friends boyfriend. gotta love a high roller!\nso there were 13 of us in our party & they were jumping through hoops for us. the service was the best i have ever had in vegas.\nwe decided to let the chef make us his best stuff and boy are we glad we did. the amazing food just kept coming out. there were so many dishes it was hard to keep track. my favorite was the black cod and the lobster. \nwe had bubbly flowing & so much sake i could barely get up without falling over!\nthe bill ended up being over 3 grand for 13 people with endless drinks & endless food & <mark>Dessert</mark>.\nby far the best meal i have ever had the pleasure of eating & it didnt cost me a thing. bonus!\nits good to be a woman...", 
            "let me preface this review by saying that i'm a huge self-admitted sushi <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> and my husband is peruvian, so nobu seemed a logical choice for our 7th anniversary dinner.  aside from the villainous penny slots  just outside the door, it was the perfect choice. \n\nwe started out with the <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark>.  yellowtail is by far my favorite raw fish and i've had a similar dish at several excellent bay area restaurants, but this was by far the most flavorful rendering of this dish that i've had. the sashimi was also not razor thin which was an awesome <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> bonus (honestly, i've gotten use to the fact that fine dining, particularly in vegas, means small portions and high prices so the amount of fish was a pleasant surprise. \n\nnext, we tried the tiradito nobu style <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> type of halibut like fish.  now, here the fish was razor thin, but came out with a dot of rocoto, a block of rock salt, the traditional lime juice and a side of cilantro.  my husband says this is exactly what tiradito is supposed to taste like, which makes me want to spend significantly more time in peru.  it was amazing.\n\nwe then moved on to the <mark>Black Cod Miso</mark> next and honestly, this was the only part of the meal that i was underwhelmed by.  i know that this is supposed to be the signature hot dish at nobu, but i've had a very similar dish at both morimoto napa and at hyakumi at cesar's palace and the texture of the fish wasn't the melt in your mouth awesomeness that i have come to expect from the dish. the flavor was right on, and if i'd never had black cod before, i would have loved it.  \n\nso, we moved back to the cold dishes and tried the <mark>White Fish <mark>Scallop <mark>Salmon <mark>Oyster <mark>Beef <mark>Yuba Sashimi New Style</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark> salmon sashimi (<mark>White Fish <mark>Scallop <mark>Salmon <mark>Oyster <mark>Beef <mark>Yuba Sashimi New Style</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark> because it's served with ginger, <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> other amazing deliciousnesss that i can't recall right now), finishing off the savory with the toro green onion maki (cut).  they were both amazing. \n\nwhat shocked me was how incredibly amazing the two <mark>Dessert</mark> we had were.  we tried the <mark>Bento Box</mark>, a flourless chocolate cake with house-made green tea <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark>, and this peach cobbler like dish with almond miso crumble and ginger <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark>.  i don't know if anyone else finds some green tea <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark> to sometimes taste vaguely like lipstick, but this <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark> was delicate and a beautiful companion to the rich chocolate cake.  the warm peaches with the crumble and (again not overpowering) ginger <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark> was a highlight of my whole trip to vegas.  (and i'm not really a dessert person)\n\nokay, this review is way too long, and i didn't even mention the impeccable service.  i can't wait to go back and wish there was a nobu in the bay area.", 
            "nobu is like a foodie dream come true. first off, the ambiance was lovely---the noise level was definitely on the high side but i didn't mind. we had a group of 5 people so we ordered several small plates. we started off with two cold dishes: oysters and <mark>Yellowtail Belly</mark> special. hot dishes: <mark>Shrimp or <mark>Scallop</mark> with Wasabi Pepper or Spicy Garlic</mark> and kobe beef gyoza. and different varieties of sushi afterwards. you really can't go wrong with any of these. the <mark>Dessert</mark> were truly a revelation and the perfect way to end the meal: yuzu panna cotta with raspberry mango caviar and raspberry sorbet; flourless chocolate molten cake with green tea <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark>; and the miso brioche/apple donuts with caramel sauce. i won't bother using any adjectives like \"delicious\" or \"amazing\" because i think the descriptions speak for themselves. end of story.", 
            "7/2: nobu hard rock rivals yellowtail @bellagio as my all-time favorite restaurant. i've been here one previous time and i don't remember much, but nothing bad. i just kept comparing it to my favorite, which is kind of unfair. however, this time was different...very memorable in a good way. \n\nmy server gordon and his waitstaff team's service was amazing! i had the locals tasting menu ($75) and it was worth every penny. every dish was cordially described in just the right amount of detail before being served. all questions were answered in a friendly manner. the atmosphere was very nice and classy as well. beautiful decor. \n\n-kobe beef taco (as an appetizer, separate from tasting menu)...best taco ever! beef was soft and moist\n\n-<mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> (best sashimi i've ever had by far! so soft and fresh. price tag aside, i could go for 10 of these plates! though that might be too much of a good thing)\n-tuna <mark><mark>Nobu's Moriawase Sashimi Salad</mark></mark> (love it. best tuna ever) \n-rock <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark> with creamy spicy (best shrimp ever...you're getting the point! i didnt know shrimp could taste this good) \n-<mark>Black Cod Miso</mark> (this and the yellowtail sashimi were my favorite dishes...high praise for these 2 seems to be the trend based off of many reviews. definitely no disagreement here. best fish ever! if you are ordering one item, i highly recommend it) \n-assorted sushi and <mark><mark>Lobster <mark>Miso Soup</mark></mark></mark> (basics but pretty good. large <mark>Scallop</mark> were <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> to the soup. unique taste and interesting twist compared to standard <mark><mark>Lobster <mark>Miso Soup</mark></mark></mark>. delicious!) \n-dessert (strawberry, vanilla, green tea <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark>)...all were great. not really a complaint, but a variety of <mark>Dessert</mark> is preferred. im sure they would be amazing like everything else as well.\n\nthank you nobu, for one of the best dining experiences ever. i will definitely be back!", 
            "had dinner here last night with friends and been here two other times.  everything is always fresh and creative.  once you get past the sticker shock you realize it's vegas and all nice restaurants cost an arm and a leg.  it's an experience though so just go with it.  we had <mark><mark>Lobster <mark>Miso Soup</mark></mark></mark>, beef and <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> tacos, <mark>King Crab Ceviche</mark>, shrimp and <mark>Scallop Tempura</mark>, some <mark>Dessert</mark>, and of course sake.  also, tons of sashimi including yelliowtail, tuna, <mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark>, wild yellowtail, and <mark>Snow Crab</mark>.  all awesome.  the service was great, the place is very nice, and the food is always great and fresh.", 
            "i would give this place a million stars, but it only goes up to 5.  my husband and i were staying at the hard rock hotel & casino on our honeymoon, and received a gift card to nobu, at our request, from my sister-in-law.  i've heard nothing but good things, and they were all true.  we chose the omakase menu option.  we had 9 courses each, and the dessert came with three different items, for each of us.  we spent just under $400 after the tip for both of us, and it was worth every penny.  the service and food was absolutely impeccable.  our server was amazing.  the manager came out to our table personally and presented us with the gift card my sister-in-law had purchased prior, over the phone.  he also provided us with complimentary glasses of champagne.  i am terrible at naming cuisine that i don't normally eat, so can't remember specifically all items we had, but for certain, the yellowtail tartare w/ caviar, the <mark>Mushroom Soup</mark>, the black cod w/ miso, the wagyu beef and the chocolate molten cake, green tea <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark> and cappucino <mark>Dessert</mark> were so delicious.  i have not one bad thing to say about the food or service at this place.  nobu at the hard rock is a gem in the middle of a loud and crazy city.  this meal was the highlight of our dining experience on our week-long honeymoon in vegas.  i would eat here every single day if i could.", 
            "my second time dining at nobu and once again it was great. some of the best sushi in vegas . the waiter was amazing . he was very knowledgable and recommended some great options. the yellowtail sashimi was great, we had to order 3 servings. the eel roll was great. we ordered a filet that came out in a covered sizzling skillet and it was cooked to perfection . the manager came and greeted us at the table and brought 3 <mark>Dessert</mark>. the banana <mark>Ice Cream or Sorbet</mark> was great. i'll be back next time i'm in town", 
            "there's a groupon for nobu?!! whaaaat!?! yes, believe it! i had purchased a groupon for a 5 course tasting menu for $80 for 2 people. and my bf was super excited because he has been wanting to try this place for a while now. it was actually perfect timing that this groupon became available because i was going to be in vegas this weekend. *woot woot!* anyways, i made reservations for 2 at 6pm online and got an e-mail confirmation right away. the groupon can only be used at the nobu inside the hard rock hotel. there's also a nobu inside caeser's palace. once we checked in with the hostesses, we were immediately seated at a nice comfy table and were greeted with a big welcome in japanese! the decor inside was really nice and elegant. i really liked the bamboo wall they had. i also thought it was really cute that we each had a rock on our table used as a chopstick holder. \n\nok onto the food! so we started off <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> edamame with sea salt, which was nothing too special but was good. next came the best sashimi i had ever had in my life! its yellowtail sashimi with a jalapeno slice on top dressed in almost like a ponzu sauce. the flavors went really well together and the yellowtail was fresh and spicy. yumm!!! i can probably eat like five more of that dish. :p the next dish was also another one of their popular dishes: the <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark>. i was really surprised that the shrimp didn't look at all like the usual tempura found at japanese restaurants. the dish almost looked like honey walnut shrimp actually but tasted ten times better. it was rich and creamy. and the sauce it was covered in was deliscious. next came their black cod dish. my bf absolutely loved this one and i can see why. it was so flakey and cooked to perfection. the fish melted in our mouths like butter and it was sweet and savory. next came a plate of sushi, which consisted of a califonia roll and 6 pieces of sashimi sushi. this dish was nothing too fancy and didn't stand out too much. but it was still tasty. and lastly we got our dessert! it was such a cute looking dessert, which composed of a green tea ice-cream, a flourless chocolate cake, and a cuppacino cup. omg...so good!!! the green tea ice-cream is made in house and  after one bite and you definetely know it's green tea ice-cream. the cuppacino cup was probably my favorite out of the other 2 <mark>Dessert</mark> because it was so beautifully crafted and tasted heavenly. the chocolate cake was very fluffy and not too sweet. overall, everything we tried was excellent! the reason why i subtracted 1 star was because both my bf and i felt that the cod and the shrimp was slightly on the saltier side and all of the dishes are pretty small plates to share between 2 people. otherwise, customer service here was superb and our server was just so friendly and informative on the dishes we were trying. i'm so happy to get to try nobu for the first time! =) so go get your groupon, while it's still available peeps!!", 
            "i have always wanted to try nobu and finally went! and it was worth the wait let me tell you! we went for my bday and did not have a reservation. we got there pretty early around 5ish so they were able to sit us without a res. our waiter jeffrey was on point. best service. he recommended we start with the <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark>. it was melt in my mouth amazing. i could live off the dish for the rest of my life. lol. it was yellowtail with the right amount of sweetness and spice. we also got the cucumber salad which was pretty good. a lot of the vinegar did go to the bottom of the bowl which made it hard to coat your salad but it was still good. we also had a sear salmon sashimi which i do not remember the name that was excellent. we got spicy edamame, <mark>Beef Kushiyaki</mark>, the black cod <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark> and the wagyu beef gyoza. the cod was really good and highly recommended. the wagyu beef was great with two dipping sauces. we literally could have kept ordering food. we had a couple of nice cocktails as well. \n\nafter dinner they brought us out a plate with happy birthday with a choc cake and green <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark>. we also ordered the whiskey moose. both <mark>Dessert</mark> were to die for and i was in heaven. \n\nwhat a fun place to go. you have people dressed to the max, casual people, people from all over the world that come and eat here. come chow down some amazing eats, listen to some funky music and watch the beautiful people. yes please!"

            "i spent $1000 for six people.  i took clients here when i was in town for business, and one of my clients wanted to go.   i wanted to hate it, being so trendy and all, but the fact is...i loved it!\n\nmy partners wife knew one of the chefs cousin who works in los angeles,  and he came out to greet the table.  he asked what we were looking for and we told him...just give us your best \"omakase\" style meal.  i don't know if the fact that we knew his cousin influenced the food or not but the whole experience was awesome.  \n\njust a few of the memorable items were:\n\n1. <mark>Shishito Peppers</mark>, fried and delicious- i had never even heard of these before...where have i been.\n2. a plethora of sashimi plates with various spices and sauces, especially the <mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark>.\n3. kobe beef on hot rocks, beef is served raw on sizzling rocks and you cook it yourself at your table.\n\nwhen i go for sushi, i usually go alone or with one other person.  i sit at the bar and make sure the chef serves me what he recommends.  i don't want sauces,  i want perfect fish.  normally i don't go for this fusion stuff.  \n\ni have to say the fish was great and the fusion was a nice change of pace.  i do live near malibu, and i have never been to the malibu nobu.  maybe i will give it a try.  \n\nit was definitely  a fun and tasty night!", 
            "i've been dying to try out nobu and matsuhisa in la for the longest time, but the thought of making a drive that far just for sushi just couldn't be justified...until now. nobu is actually a japanese fusion restaurant, so for all of you purest out there, this is not your dining of choice.\n\nnow for the food...the ingredients are what make japanese food such a delicacy. and when it comes to seafood, especially sashimi, if your stock isn't fresh, i can taste it. that said, we decided to stuff our faces for the true nobu experience. \n\n*the yk50 is a semi-dry and rather sweet sake that was super light\n*<mark>Shishito Peppers</mark> - grilled peppers w/ an extremely simple miso sauce w/ toasted sesame\n*tuna tataki. great sauce, perfect w/ the daikon and garlic chips.\n*kumamoto oysters. not the best i've had, the sauces actually took away from the natural sweetness of this variety of oyster.\n*yellowtail sashimi w/ jalapenos. probably my favorite of the meal. extremely simple sauce w/ a spicy bite. my mouth is salivating just thinking about it :p\n*<mark><mark>Nobu's Moriawase Sashimi Salad</mark></mark>. we got a tuna/hamachi mix instead. it had a delicious miso dressing on a medley spring mix\n*amai ebi. it was a little oily this time, but the shrimp was ridiculously fresh.\n*crunchy roll w/ king crab. probably my least favorite of the night. it was creative though with the crunch topping that gave a nice twist on the typical roll.\n*tempura plate. the <mark>Vegetable</mark> were so sweet, it didn't even require the tentsuyu (tempura sauce)\n*fried shrimp w/ butter ponzu sauce. butter and ponzu is an amazing combination. so its not typical japanese but definitely try this one if you get a chance. \n\ni do believe i've never truly experienced a food coma until tonight.", 
            "this is nobu. what else can i say? this was one of the very first real fine-dining establishments i visited when i first arrived in las vegas. you can't even imagine. at nobu, i first tried tiradito, <mark>Shishito Peppers</mark>, edamame, hot sake... the list goes on. gourmand i was not. enter nobu, one of the best dining experiences i've had to date in this city.\n\neverything is great, obviously all of the sashimi, ceviche, tiradito, everything is sublime. i mean, nobu matsuhisa invented miso black cod, hello!\n\ni will say this, it is mighty expensive. and you kind of have to accept that you won't leave here full. or at least, i never have. i am no high roller. but believe me, it is all worth it.", 
            "the bar for nobu was set pretty high after trying the full omakase experience at kabuto the night before.  i did my yelp homework and scoured previous reviews, making note of the oft recommended items, and went in knowing exactly what my friend and i would order.\n\nwe ordered a gamut of different dishes: <mark>Shishito Peppers</mark>, edamame, wagyu beef, jalape\\u00f1o yellowtail, rock <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark>, lamp chop, otoro and salmon sashimi, miso black cod. \n\ni thought i was assembling a nobu all-star meal; what we ended up with was a mediocre and extremely overpriced meal.  for every dish that we  ordered, i could list a superior counterpart at japonais or sunda in chicago for a fraction of the cost.\n\nalso of note is the fact that our waiter initially remarked that sashimi orders came as two pieces, but when we got our bill, we noted that our four bite-sized slices of otoro came to a total of $76.  the wagyu was also incredibly overpriced for what we got; apparently each ounce is $30 or so and the minimum order is 2 ounces.  \n\nmaybe it was the sheer excellence of the previous night's meal, but we left feeling we had blown $350 on a very unsatisfactory experience.  even at half the price, the value would be questionable.", 
            "this is the only restaurant that i would recommend at the hard rock hotel. i was working at the hrh for five days and ended up eating at almost every establishment there. nobu is the only one that i would optionally go to again.\n\nthis is the best sushi i've had. everything was flavorful and top quality. i can't remember all the dishes i had, but below are the ones i can remember (score out of 5):\n\n-bug <mark>Nobu Crispy Rice with Big Eye Tuna</mark> lotus chips 4\n-<mark>Shishito Peppers</mark> 2 (i got a really spicy one!)\n-<mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> 4\n-rock <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark> with creamy spicy sauce 4 (butter ponzu sauce 3)\n-rice cubes <mark>Nobu Crispy Rice with Big Eye Tuna</mark> spread 3\n-sushi roll with 4 types of fish 5\n-<mark>Black Cod Miso</mark> 10 you must get this, it is sooooo good!\n-horchata flan 3\n\ni would go just for the <mark>Black Cod Miso</mark>!\n\nthe food is great, but the service was lacking. when we sat down we were a group of 5 and a 6th person joined us. when the waiter brought the tuna lotus chips out he said there are only 5 since that's how many you were when you sat down. he easily could have said i'll bring you another, but i had to specifically ask him. for the price, service should be better, maybe because it's still in the hard rock.", 
            "four of us dined at nobu on feb 28th. i was very disappointed in the quality, texture, and flavor of the seafood dishes. also, the waitstaff seemed rushed and it was extremely loud. those two elements combined made it a very chaotic ambiance. we ordered $400 (overpriced) worth of food and drinks. the following are dishes i had sampled.\n\nspicy miso lotus chips <mark>Nobu Crispy Rice with Big Eye Tuna</mark> & scallop - the chips were crispy and not oily. the tuna was ok. the <mark>Scallop</mark> were not. something was off.\n\n<mark>Shishito Peppers</mark> - i loved these peppers. they are full of flavor yet not spicy. i could snack on them all day. \n\n<mark>Mushroom Soup</mark> - this tasted meaty and delicious.\n\ntoro (blue fin) <mark>Toro (Blue Fin) <mark>Yellowtail and Scallion</mark></mark> sushi roll - i did not like this at all. the texture of the fish seemed off to me.\n\n<mark>Sea Urchin</mark> nigiri - the texture and flavor was ok.\n\n<mark>Chicken Kushiyaki</mark> (teriyaki & anticucho) - ok. a bit dry and overcooked. \n\nteriyaki <mark>Tenderloin of Beef</mark> - good.", 
            "impeccable comes to mind when i look back at dinner last night. just wow! \nwe started with <mark>Shishito Peppers</mark> and an amazing tuna <mark><mark>Nobu's Moriawase Sashimi Salad</mark></mark>, moved on to a squid and vegetable dish/casserole that was out of this world followed by miso blackened cod that was absolutely mouth watering.  then came some of the best sushi! yellowtail with scallion roll, yellowtail with jalape\\u00f1o roll, <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark> roll. the wine was a lovely napa chardonnay. \nthe ambiance of this restaurant is calming and the service is excellent! \njapanese restaurants are plentiful in this town so an outstanding stand out restaurant in this category means a lot: this restaurant is outstanding and stands on its own!\nthe prices are very reasonable. not at all overpriced. highly recommended. i am definitely going back!"

            "i got stranded in vegas once when la air traffic control cancelled all flights into la during the la fires. \n\nthat night, my coworker/buddy danny and i decided to splurge and try this \"nobu\" place out... and it was amazing! damn!!!\n\nsince then i have dined at nobu almost every time i've been in town. in fact, i even had my 30th birthday dinner there last year! \n\nnow, based on that experience, i wouldn't recommend nobu for large groups... it becomes too complicated and they pair down the menu for you so you can't please everyone and charge auto-gratuity, etc... let's just say it can be a hassle.\n\nhowever, for a date or a group of 4 or so people, it's great! \n\nthe decor is simple. the staff is more than ample. and i want to install that polished black river rock wall they have in my house! i digress... \n\nwhile, i haven't had enough sushi here to comment, my must-order menu is as follows:\n-chilled toro tuna <mark>Yellowtail or Salmon <mark>Blue Fin <mark>Toro Tartare</mark> with Royal Ossetra Caviar</mark></mark>: too rich for one man!\n-roasted arctic char with airfried spinach. soo tenda'\n-the cod! buttery, delicious, melts right in yo mouth!\n-baked crab legs! creamy, buttery. do not try to eat this on your own! \n\nyou cannot go wrong with any of these choices... unless you have high-blood pressure or are allergic to shellfish...", 
            "yes! i finally dined at nobu, considering it was iron chef, masaharu morimoto's restaurants when he won the challenge. ok, this is not the original restaurant where he worked (that is in nyc) but this is a branch of it. according to wikipedia, he left nobu in 1999, eventually opening his own morimoto restaurant in philadelphia in 2001. so i will eventually eat at morimoto.\nnobu was a good experience, although as other yelpers pointed out, why was this in hard rock cafe (seemed kinda out of place) and the kitchy hawaiian decor, the decor lost one star in my books.\n\nthe miso cod was heavenly and so was the tuna <mark>Yellowtail or Salmon <mark>Blue Fin <mark>Toro Tartare</mark> with Royal Ossetra Caviar</mark></mark>. the roll we had was good as well. pricey but definitely quality sushi.", 
            "if we overlook the fact that the restaurant wrote down our reservation for 10 for the wrong night, my group's dining experience here was exceptional and we were pleased that they were still able to seat us despite this error. the service was incredibly fast (3 people from our group were late and we completely finished our meal by the time they arrived,) and the food was fabulous. the flavors were crisp, unique, and every bite of food was like an explosion in my mouth. since we shared all the dishes we ordered, that pretty much means that we only got one bite so we savored it for all that it was worth. damn you nobu for being so expensive! otherwise i would have ordered 2 of everything!\n\na couple of dishes i would recommend trying are:\n-<mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark>\n-toro tartar <mark>Yellowtail or Salmon <mark>Blue Fin <mark>Toro Tartare</mark> with Royal Ossetra Caviar</mark></mark>\n-black cod <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark>\n-rock <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark>\n-new zealand mussels with the garlic sauce\n\n***the must try dish is the fish/<mark>Lobster <mark>Tuna <mark>King Crab <mark>Vegetable <mark>Salmon Nobu Style Taco</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark>!!!***\nthey are not on the menu here, but you can special order them and they are awesome. i have pictures to prove it.", 
            "have faith.\n\nthat's all i can say about this place.  have faith, and trust, that they will knock your socks off!!\n\neverything was smooth and heaven, even if the portions aren't that big.  don't worry, the flavors will satisfy you.  every bite was a small explosion in my mouth.  every bite made me jizz a little bit in my pants.....and it's only 8 at night!!\n\nthings you have to try:\n-<mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark>\n-toro tartar <mark>Yellowtail or Salmon <mark>Blue Fin <mark>Toro Tartare</mark> with Royal Ossetra Caviar</mark></mark>\n-black cod <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark>\n-rock <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark>\n\nand\n\nfish/<mark>Lobster <mark>Tuna <mark>King Crab <mark>Vegetable <mark>Salmon Nobu Style Taco</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark>!!!\n\nif you don't see it on the menu, just ask for it.\n\ntrust me, just do it!", 
            "the <mark>Lobster <mark>Tuna <mark>King Crab <mark>Vegetable <mark>Salmon Nobu Style Taco</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark> were probably the most whimsical, brilliant, west coast culinary delight that i've ever tasted.  sounds simple, but i dare any high end mexican eatery to execute as well as the chefs at nobu.\n\nthe <mark>Yellowtail or Salmon <mark>Blue Fin <mark>Toro Tartare</mark> with Royal Ossetra Caviar</mark></mark> was different than anything i've ever put in my mouth.  top 5 meals of my life.", 
            "i agree with ming-jou in the fact that i was totally disappointed at this place. i should have also listened to my friend who went there and was really disappointed at their omakase, but being japanese, i wanted to try their food to see what the hype was about.  we had reservations at 9 pm and although we got there earlier, they didn't seat us till then.  it was shockingly a loud place that we often had to yell at each other to talk and even to order.  also, the crowd was much older than i anticipated.  the interior had a nice asian feel to it with bamboos everywhere, even on the ceilings.\n\nfor starters, we had edamame, yellowtail tartar <mark>Yellowtail or Salmon <mark>Blue Fin <mark>Toro Tartare</mark> with Royal Ossetra Caviar</mark></mark>, <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark>.  the menu was vague that we didn't expect any sauce with the tartar, but to our surprise, it came in a sauce with wasabi that was a little spicy.  i wish the menu would have included more details.  we got to order individual tempura items, which was a \"first\" for me.  we ordered shrimp, broccoli, and sweet potato.  the order came with 2 pieces each.  i liked how it came out really hot with light batter.  also, they were generous with their tempura sauce with daikon-oroshi (grated daikon).  most places give you barely enough sauce.  for dinner, we shared the <mark>Sushi Dinner</mark> which came with 8 nigiri and 6 pieces of tekka maki (<mark>Big Eye Tuna Roll</mark>).  the sushi rice tasted old as it was cold and flat, not warm and plump.  also, the rice portion for a nigiri was much more than it needed.  fish seemed fresh, but the rice was disappointing.  that ruined my dinner.\n\nwe decided to try their dessert since we don't usually order dessert at an asian restaurant.  we tried their miso almond cake which was the best part of my meal.  it came <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> caramel glaze and edamame <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark>.  the cake was yummier than i expected.  \n\noverall, it was not as good as i expected but i'm giving 3 stars for the good dessert and the great service.", 
            "i had high expectation coming in and left feeling somewhat unsatisfied.  while i do think nobu is a great sushi place to experience, it's a bit over hyped and is priced accordingly..\n\nthe place was not well lid so we opted for the sushi bar where we could actually see the food.  our sushi chef was cool, attentive, and a superb artisan.  i ordered the omakase ($100) and was pretty happy with the variety of dishes:\n1) toro <mark>Yellowtail or Salmon <mark>Blue Fin <mark>Toro Tartare</mark> with Royal Ossetra Caviar</mark></mark> - this was the highlight dish .. fabulous!\n2) 4 different sashimi dishes - <mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark>, yellowtail and a few others .. exotic varieties, beautifully presented, but a bit overpowered by the sauces .. i left nobu with a very strong ponzu aftertaste\n3) black cod .. good but sooooo overrated.  the sauce was just too strong for this delicate fish.  \n4) tenderloin with shitake and enoki mushrooms - i really regret asking to have this well done.  doh!\n5) 5 different pieces of sushi - ameabi, grilled eel, and a few others .. all were pretty good.\n\nthe waiting service was lacking for a fine dining establishment.  i found that the best waiting services are those that are not very visible but are attentive and will serve your needs before being asked.  nobu's staff, while very nice, was more of the opposite.  you see lots of guys crowding the restaurant but still have to ask and wait for stuffs.  the predominately male wait staffs also makes me wonder how tough it must be to compete for female employees with the local cabarets.\n\nbottom line:  i'm glad i tried nobu.  but, it'll be a long while before i come back especially when there are so many other options there in vegas.", 
            "have the bluefin <mark>Toro Tartare</mark> w/ caviar & the miso black cod - we made the mistake of ordering the lettuce wrap instead of the whole fish this weekend, order the fish instead of the wraps its muuuuch better. you cannot go wrong with anything on the menu! i don't remember what else we had because we had one of each of the specials. *be sure to have uni w/ quail egg and the cucumber or acai martini \n\nthe service:\n\nthe first time we went it was impeccable.\n\nsecond time, it was no bueno... i brought friends here bc i had been ranting and raving about it & they wanted to hear what the fuss was about. the food they loved (minus the <mark>Lobster <mark>Tuna <mark>King Crab <mark>Vegetable <mark>Salmon Nobu Style Taco</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark>). so about the service, i think the waiter was having some issues. i had him repeat the order beforehand bc i wanted everything to go smoothly. regardless of that he messed up our order. drinks - brought one too many, double ordered the miso black cod & the brought the wrong kobe dish which is $35 an oz..... we got a few ounces. it reflects me so i was bothered, i tried to work it out with the waiter bc i for one was not going to have us pay for his mistakes. he was only able to comp 2 oz of the kobe and remove half of the cod.. usually service can ruin a rating but i love the food and forgive the guy, must've been one of those days.", 
            "it was a hit-and-miss experience at nobu in vegas.\n\nhits: <mark>Mixed Seafood Ceviche</mark>, sweet <mark>Shrimp</mark> - <mark>White Fish <mark>Scallop <mark>Salmon <mark>Oyster <mark>Beef <mark>Yuba Sashimi New Style</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark> sashimi, kumamoto oysters <mark>Kumamoto Oyster with <mark>Bone in Ribeye 24oz Nobu Sauce</mark></mark>, <mark>Lobster <mark>Tuna <mark>King Crab <mark>Vegetable <mark>Salmon Nobu Style Taco</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark>, bluefin tuna tartar <mark>Yellowtail or Salmon <mark>Blue Fin <mark>Toro Tartare</mark> with Royal Ossetra Caviar</mark></mark>, and tiradito <mark>Scallop</mark>.\n\nmisses: black cod <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark>, <mark>House Special</mark> deluxe roll, fried mai with sweet butter sauce.\n\npersonal favorites are bluefin tuna tartar and sweet <mark>Shrimp</mark> - <mark>White Fish <mark>Scallop <mark>Salmon <mark>Oyster <mark>Beef <mark>Yuba Sashimi New Style</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark> sashimi. presentation and tastes of these two plates are superb and i have never had before. you will be craving for more after you finish the tuna tartar, which are sized like your pinky; you will keep sucking the shrimp tails to get the last piece out.\n\nthe reason of my miss experience is that we trusted the waiter's recommendations and ordered the cooked food. to be honest, i strongly advise everyone to stay away from the cook food. if you want to be full, go across the street and get a burger after. this place is pricey and you definitely like to spend your money wisely on the right stuff.\n\np.s. i have not had the opportunity to have hamachi jalapeno and cannot offer any comment. however, i know a place in san francisco offers a very similar dish and it was quite good, if not great.", 
            "i love this place.  \n\ncame here on my bacheloratte weekend, yep!  we did the whole weekend at the hard rock!  \n\nwe had the omakase, everything was delicious!  the best's gotta be the toro tartar <mark>Yellowtail or Salmon <mark>Blue Fin <mark>Toro Tartare</mark> with Royal Ossetra Caviar</mark></mark>!  also the miso black cod!  we ended up ordering extra orders of the cod.\n\ni've been to the one in malibu, but my experience here in vegas was a much pleasant one.  maybe because it's vegas baby...", 
            "the hype about the miso black cod is true.  tasty.  melts in the mouth.  $23 for it is reasonable.  however the blue fin toro <mark>Yellowtail or Salmon <mark>Blue Fin <mark>Toro Tartare</mark> with Royal Ossetra Caviar</mark></mark> is not worth $32.  it was good but the price is a little over the top. check attached photo.  i love the <mark>Sea Urchin</mark> and eel but then again \ni really love <mark>Sea Urchin</mark> and eel regardless where i eat them.  our waiter is always disappearing. the busser was more attentive than our waiter.  the experience was just okay for me i guess.  it just makes me appreciate other jap restaurants owned by japanese with japanese waiters more.", 
            "the food here was amazing! we've heard about nobu from a friend of ours and decided to have our valentines dinner here. our waiter suggested 4-5 dishes for the both of us. so, we ordered the monk fish liver <mark>Yellowtail or Salmon <mark>Blue Fin <mark>Toro Tartare</mark> with Royal Ossetra Caviar</mark></mark>, tuna sashimi, salmon tartar, black cod <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark>, uni and an order of the <mark>Soft Shell Crab</mark> roll for the fiance who doesn't enjoy much raw dishes. the food and not to mention the presentation was incredible. we enjoyed each and every dish. for dessert, we picked the <mark>Bento Box</mark> which includes warm valrhona chocolate souffle cake, shiso syrup, white chocolate sauce and green tea <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark> mmmmmmmmmmmmm. i'm so ready to go back and try more dishes on their menu.", 
            "every detail was covered, from a rich broth of <mark><mark>Lobster <mark>Miso Soup</mark></mark></mark> with clams to lovely service from a friendly server. he was really informative and helped us pick through the menu. the interior is contemporary japanese and beautiful. and the food was fantastic.\n\nwe had a tasty hamachi <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> slices. i've had this dish at other places but nobu slices the jalapenos paper thin and dresses the fish in a fantastic sauce. their rendition also includes a cilantro leaf and i'm a huge fan of the herb. great balance of flavors and quality of fish.\ntuna <mark><mark>Nobu's Moriawase Sashimi Salad</mark></mark>. this is a mountain of crisp salad with the sashimi draped around the base. it's a little technically difficult to eat because i wasn't sure how to get it all in one bite. but the salad was delicious and the tuna was, of course, amazing.\nblue fin toro <mark>Yellowtail or Salmon <mark>Blue Fin <mark>Toro Tartare</mark> with Royal Ossetra Caviar</mark></mark>. i think toro needs to be eaten as sashimi/nirigi or over rice as chirashi. mincing it up seems wrong.\n\nand the highlight was the <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> dish with seven spices and liberal amounts of clarified butter. holy gawd!! this was fantastic!! it was an explosion of flavors in your mouth and utterly, indescribably delicious. they split the <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> in half, cook the meat in large chunks, and then place it back into the shell. it makes for a beautiful presentation yet the tender chunks of meat are easy to remove and eat.\n\ninterestingly, i've been to other nobu restaurants and the menu is strikingly similar. i don't know why, but that seems odd.", 
            "you fancy huh? yes.. i sure am.\n\ni had a super disappointing dinner the night before (classic tasting dinner at michael mina), and needed something to really make it up. \n\ni came here for dinner with a really good friend i hadn't seen in a long time. we had both been wanting to try the famed nobu for soo long, that when we got there.. the menu seemed overwhelming. so, we (ok.. he) decided we should splurge for the omakase menu! and i'm so glad we did. there are too many courses to go over, but the most memorable were the tuna tartar <mark>Yellowtail or Salmon <mark>Blue Fin <mark>Toro Tartare</mark> with Royal Ossetra Caviar</mark></mark>, black cod and the dessert. soo good!!\n\ni'm so glad we went here for dinner.. the service was excellent, the decor was nice, and the food delish!\n\ndefinitely a great date spot.. teehee. :)", 
            "one of by best friends from la was raving about nobu in hollywood so we found ourselves at the hard rock and decided to drop by and have dinner.  the hostesses are friendly, and the servers have great knowledge of the menu items and offer great recommendations.  we decided to order the <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> shrimp salad, seared kobe beef platter, and the <mark>Yellowtail or Salmon <mark>Blue Fin <mark>Toro Tartare</mark> with Royal Ossetra Caviar</mark></mark>.  all great dishes (see my photos), but portion size is small so if you like to eat alot...this is not the place for you!!!  your better off at an all you can eat sushi place!  all in all this is a special place to celebrate a special moment with friends or a significant person!  overall, a great experience!!!", 
            "my buddy and i went to nobu this past friday night at 9:30 for their omasake chef choice tasting menu. we had very few disappointments. they sat us right away at the bar, tables would have been 15 minutes even with our reservations.  lots of good energy in the restaurant, lots of japanese yelling back and forth from the waiters and sushi chefs.  we split a $50 bottle of nonfiltered very fragrant nigori sake cold which was smooth and easy to drink. the small bits of rice at the bottle of the bottle reminded me of red wine sediment as a good thing. \n\nthe first course came out quick and cold. a chilled patty of toro tartar in a soy wasabi sauce topped <mark>Yellowtail or Salmon <mark>Blue Fin <mark>Toro Tartare</mark> with Royal Ossetra Caviar</mark></mark>, served with a baby silver spoon.  it was tender, smooth, rich and melt in your mouth.  the caviar was not memorable.  an a+ start and an expensive dish on their regular menu. next was 4 pieces per plate of thin cut fresh octopus topped with a cilantro leaf, a dot of super hot sauce, finished with citrus, like ceviche.  pretty good.  next was another cold appetizer of rice paper wrapped greens with a piece of raw ebi sweet shrimp, dressed with a fantastic sesame ginger sauce with a fried prawn head on the side.  my buddy especially liked the tempura batter on the <mark>Sweet Shrimp with Fried Head</mark> and the dressing.  i will personally come to your house and kill you if you do not eat the fried prawn head. \n\nthen started the hot plates.  first was the ever famous <mark>Black Cod Miso</mark> cod, a bit too sweet for my buddy but it did not keep us from both licking the plates.  a small piece of tender fish which just went on and on and kept melting in our mouths.  flavor of fish hard to come through past miso and sweetness.  like fish candy in a good way.  my friend said that an improvement would be to torch and crisp up the skin before putting on the sauce which would give some texture contrast and make the dish over the top.  $23 on the regular menu.  next was the beef tenderloin toban yaki style with a shitake and enokitake mushrooms and a piece of thin asparagus in a soy broth. beef very lean, not as melt in your mouth as i would like.  my buddy would have liked a nice piece of ribeye cap instead but who wouldn't.  the dish is served spitting hot on a mini hot plate and when they raise the cover in front of you, the steam envelopes you warmly.  try not to get the grease on you. \n\nnext was the nigiri sushi course of 5 pieces along with a nice clam <mark><mark>Lobster <mark>Miso Soup</mark></mark></mark>. we got a piece of <mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> (mmmm), magura tuna (so tender), yellowtail (yum), clam (a bit tough) and <mark>Sea Eel</mark> which was the most tender fall apart <mark>Sea Eel</mark> i have ever tasted.  the sushi rice <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> fill you to the gills by that point and then they hit you with the dessert which was a bento presentation of a warm flowerless chocolate lava cake with lots of lava and very little cake and a very good not sweet green tea <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark>.   this just put the nail in the coffin.  we were stuffed, but we couldn't stop eating since it was so good.  \n\nthe restaurant closed at 11pm on a friday night, but we will remember the meal for a long time coming.  next time i'm in vegas i plan to make it a point to return and see what the chef choice is at that point in time.  this was the $100 omasake.  the $150 would have <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> some kobe beef and <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> and there.  we were very happy with our choice.  i think the meal was an absolute bargain for the price.", 
            "last night if you ordered the $150 omakase menu they donated $50 to the people in japan. great food for a good cause. the restaurant was packed (on a tuesday night) and the service was perfect. totally attentive and choreographed without being annoying. my husband and i split the $150 omakase for two and ordered two other specials to go along with it and it was a feast. our favorites were the yellowtail special, the lobster (split and restuffed with panko and chili), and the monkfish liver <mark>Yellowtail or Salmon <mark>Blue Fin <mark>Toro Tartare</mark> with Royal Ossetra Caviar</mark></mark>. but it was all good. amazing ingredients, beautiful to look at, and nothing that we could ever come close to making for ourselves at home.", 
            "ok, this place is expensive, sure.  if you go and order some maguro, unagi, and a dragon roll you'll probably be disappointed.  but i wanted to see everything they could offer so i did the tasting menu, and it was just plain awesome. \n\ndefinitely a few dishes that i'll remember for some time.  there was this fatty tuna cylinder floating in a mix of soy/wasabe <mark>Yellowtail or Salmon <mark>Blue Fin <mark>Toro Tartare</mark> with Royal Ossetra Caviar</mark></mark> on top that was simply fantastic.  \n\n$175 a person lighter later, and not only was i satisfied but happy to have had the experience of eating here.  absolutely a top notch restaurant in the land of famous chain/celebrity chef restaurants.",

            "went there in the summer to celebrate boyfriend's birthday. of course, we had the omakase... \n\nkey points:\n- the exotic fish sashimi and tartar were very very good, because they were usually combined <mark>Yellowtail or Salmon <mark>Blue Fin <mark>Toro Tartare</mark> with Royal Ossetra Caviar</mark></mark>. fresh too... duh... \n- black cod. signature!!! yummy!!! although to be honest, i think it could be a little too sweet for certain individuals. \n- yellow tail w/ jalape\\u00f1os. interesting testing. def something new for me!\n- kobe beef... whatever. \n- sushi. really??? ok... don't ever go to nobu for the sushi. it's not even real japanese rice or freshly made wasabi!!!! \n- best best best warm chocolate lava green tea <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark> cake ever!!!!\n\nbtw, the bill was around $350. no complains whatsoever.\n\nconclusion: must go before you die. or before your taste buds die.", 
            "oh nobu - mi amore!!  \n\ni've been to this restaurant countless times and it is always amazing!   after my recent visit i realized i have to give proper respect and yelp my love for them.  here are some of my favorites:\n\ntoro <mark>Yellowtail or Salmon <mark>Blue Fin <mark>Toro Tartare</mark> with Royal Ossetra Caviar</mark></mark> - this dish makes me want to commit a felony.  if i were on death row it would be my last meal, i would definitely die happy.  as one of my favorite sayings on howard stern perfectly stated, this dish will make you 'go ahead and release the poison'.\n\n<mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> - always fresh and delicious!  i believe that all other sushi restaurants have tried to duplicate this dish but can never quite get the perfect flavor. \n\n<mark><mark>Nobu's Moriawase Sashimi Salad</mark></mark> - bam!  the dressing is off the chain, the tuna beyond fresh.  \n\nkobe beef toban yaki - i'm not a religious person by any means but i'm certain the heeled hands of jesus came down and prepared this dish himself with the blessing of his father.\n\nof course you cannot go there without consuming a couple of their saketini's.  why can't any other bar/restaurant get their saketini's to be this delicious??  they are alone worth a visit there.", 
            "really a 41/2.  back a week later except ate in the bar this time.  had them make a scallop role in soy paper <mark>Yellowtail or Salmon <mark>Blue Fin <mark>Toro Tartare</mark> with Royal Ossetra Caviar</mark></mark> on top, awesome.  also, stuck with sashimi again - yellowtail, <mark>Snow Crab</mark>, japanese halibut, albacore, and octopus.  one tuna nigiri and <mark><mark>Lobster <mark>Miso Soup</mark></mark></mark> too.  had a couple martini's and had a shot of this unbelievable tequila called deleon.  very smooth and unique.  expensive but we were celebrating so very worth it.  service was very good and our server was very helpful and offered other local joints to eat at suggestion wise.  expensive but a great place.",

            "the most overrated and expensive place for the food. i mean the ambiance was nice and great servers, but nah i wouldn't come back. the group all picked the $125 prefix menu and it was a total disappointment. when asked about the sashimi type, it was just your basic salmon, hamachi. i was like damn, but didn't want to upgrade.  there was like 6 dishes or so. the beef dish was super dry, tasted like bad flank steak. the sashimi dishes were good, but it was the sauces that did it. omg the chocolate moose/cake with green tea was the worst dessert for a high end restaurant. the monkish pate <mark>Yellowtail or Salmon <mark>Blue Fin <mark>Toro Tartare</mark> with Royal Ossetra Caviar</mark></mark> was good and different. we were still hungry, therefore, ordered two rounds of uni and amaebi. crap, it was like $10 a piece!~~ oh the sake <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark>, way over priced!!!\n\ni think for 7 people, the bill was like $1500",

            "i'm not going to lie--a small part of me dies every time i think about how much we spent here.  but the truth of the matter is, you can't get good sushi without paying for it.  \n\nwe ordered the $100 omakase, the uni tempura set, kabocha tempura, and salmon sashimi.\n\nthe fusion dishes (like the hamachi <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> or the snapper with cucumber <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Whole <mark>1/2 Maine Lobster</mark></mark> <mark>Roasted Poussin with Spicy Lemon</mark></mark> juice) were fun to try but i find that the sauces often overpower the fish, which is the best thing about nobu.  if you have never tried any of their signature dishes, you might want to order at least one of the omakase options, but if you're just looking to enjoy the fish qua fish, then order the sashimi and/or nigiri a la carte.\n\nand yes, let's talk about the fish.  i have never had such a wonderfully buttery miso black cod!  and the toro, maguro, aji, trout, and sake (as in salmon sashimi) simply melted in our mouths.  no biting necessary.  the only low point was that the anago in our complimentary sushi was littered with small fish bones but hey, it was complimentary!  yet another reason why i love nobu.  they know how to treat the ladies right.\n\nas for the tempura, the kabocha was out of season, so it was our bad for ordering it in the first place, but the uni tempura was unlike anything i have ever had.  every bite was bursting with succulence and the tempura batter <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> extra texture and flavor.  heavenly.  anyone who is a fan of uni and/or tempura needs to try this!  it also comes with tempura shiitake mushroom (luxuriously juicy), tempura shiso leaf (so crispy, so light), and one other <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark> that i forget but that my mom thought was delicious.\n\nthe dessert was lovely too--we had the <mark>Bento Box</mark> which consists of flourless chocolate cake and homemade green tea <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark>.  not too sweet and the perfect way to end a perfect meal.\n\ni seriously cannot wait to come back here again and try the <mark>Hamachi Kama</mark>, the snapper, the whole fried fish, and the squid salad.  is it expensive?  yes.  but is it worth it?  most definitely.", 
            "having owned nobu's cookbook for years, i was only too excited to finally visit a restaurant of his.  (which means my lazy ass never made anything form the cookbook but my excuse is that some of his ingredients are so hard to find....but i digress).\n\ndrinks:\njyunmai sake - \"masu\" size (wooden box cup) smooth and lovely to drink\nyk 35 - \"masu\" size.  this was the most expensive one on their list and boy was it worth every dollar.\nnote: masu is served in an overflowing box-cup on a plate.  you finish your cup and then pour what's on the plate back into your vessel.\n\nfood:\nmonkfish liver - honestly, not my thing.  i tried but just couldn't get over the fish-flavored paste.  it had caviar on top which i ate.  but my husband who loved it said the sweet miso sauce enhanced the whole thing greatly.  he enjoyed having the dish to himself.\ntiradito, nobu style - sashimi with a dab of hot chili sauce and black sea salt and cilantro.  one of my faves but not for hubby\n<mark>White Fish <mark>Scallop <mark>Salmon <mark>Oyster <mark>Beef <mark>Yuba Sashimi New Style</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark> sashimi - sashimi doused <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> sauce and oil, topped with ginger and green onions. also one of my faves but had to share this one with hubby. \nsweet shrimp <mark>White Fish <mark>Scallop <mark>Salmon <mark>Oyster <mark>Beef <mark>Yuba Sashimi New Style</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark> sashimi - even better than the above.  yum.  hubby let me have most of this one and for that, i'm forever grateful.\nuni tempura - this was the one thing i wanted to try the most.  the shiso wrapped around the uni gave it another facet and i greatly enjoyed this dish...on my own.  more for me!  the accompanying shitake mushroom and salts were delicious.\nmiso black cod - i didn't have high hopes but our server recommended it so we went with it.  i was pleasantly surprised.  the serving size was reasonable.  four 2-bite pieces served on butter lettuce and topped with crispy noodle things.  very enjoyable.\n<mark>Scallop</mark> <mark><mark>Whole <mark>1/2 Maine Lobster</mark></mark> with Wasabi Pepper</mark> sauce - again, a pretty good-sized serving. the sauce was phenomenal although i do wish there was more of a wasabi kick.  i'm no wuss about spiciness but the pepper in this kept choking me up.  \n\ndessert:\ncaramel chocolate mouse - i thought this sounded rather ordinary until i looked at the ingredient list.  globe of chocolate filled halfway with mousse (very light and delicate), topped with a toffee disc, topped <mark>Squid with Shiso</mark> citrus granite, topped with caramel \"caviar\"; everything sat on top of a thick coconut sauce, dusting of brown powder sugar and crispy japanese rice.  best dish we had all night.  loved it.  i could have had 3 more.\n\nservice was great with several lapses here and there.  the busboys were impeccable.  our server got less and less attentive with the arrival of his other tables.\n\nthe quality of the food was excellent and did not disappoint.  i'm no stranger to paying several bills for dinner but for whatever reason, i did feel that food was somewhat overpriced here.  or maybe for what we paid, i thought the food should have been 5-star.", 
            "service and food were both amazing.  must have: black cod <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark> and <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark>.  wasnt too particularly thrilled with the <mark>Whole <mark>1/2 Maine Lobster</mark></mark>, but everything else was perfect.",

            "bluf...the dining highlight of my trip to vegas with my girlfriend was our dinner at nobu.  this was my third trip to nobu, each time having had the chef's omakase tasting menu.  nobu's tasting menu is a thoughtfully composed meal served kaiseki-style (sort of a themed meal) that seeks to tie together individual dishes by attributes like taste, texture, and temperature to enhance the overall experience of the meal.  since there isn't a set menu, you select the price point you're willing to pay and the chef and the kitchen staff prepares an appropriate amount of courses using whatever exotic ingredients they deem fit.  we both received 9 courses with sake pairing. \n\nfirst course:  we started with a kumamoto oyster wrapped in <mark>Smoked Salmon</mark> topped with a osetra caviar, served on an endive leaf in an asparagus \"boat\" with accompanied by sweet <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> miso sauces.  a masterful start!  the 5 basic tastes were tastefully and elegantly captured together in a single dish! \n\nsecond course:  shima-aji sashimi served in a tosazu (vinegared sardines) gel\\u00e9e with micro celery and \"sea grapes\" kelp...garnished with pickled turnip.  a great all-around dish, but the pickle turnip was the ingredient that put it over the top!\n\nthird course:  bluefin tuna sashimi topped <mark>Squid 'Pasta' with Light Garlic</mark> pur\\u00e9e and sliced serrano chilies with jalape\\u00f1o emulsion over brown rice salsa.  i love sashimi, but the garlicky goodness and spiciness from the chilies was amazing.  the brown rice salsa was damn tasty in its own right!\n\nfourth course:  <mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> and seared sweet shrimp <mark><mark>Nobu's Moriawase Sashimi Salad</mark></mark> served with m\\u00e2che, peppercorn, <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Whole <mark>1/2 Maine Lobster</mark></mark> <mark>Roasted Poussin with Spicy Lemon</mark></mark> dressing.   another success!  the peppercorns gave it the spicy notes that greatly accented the raw fish.\n\nintermezzo:  a <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark>...a simple yet refreshing palate cleanser that marked the transition from cold dishes to hot.\n\nfifth course:  pan-seared seabass, seasonal mushrooms, and wild ramps served in a <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> sauce.  as much as i loved the seabass, the earthy mushrooms and ramps nearly stole the show in this dish!\n\nsixth course:  grilled wagyu beef with seared <mark>Teppan Style Foie Gras</mark> served over yellow sweet corn and snap peas <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark>-mirin reduction.  the oh-so-tender australian-raised wagyu beef paired nicely with the perfectly seared <mark>Teppan Style Foie Gras</mark>.  \n\nseventh course:  dashi <mark>Inaniwa Pasta with Lobster</mark> and enoki mushroom with japanese greens.  so simple, yet such an incredibly satisfying dish!  they didn't skimp on the lobster, either.  in many ways, this was my favorite dish of the night.\n\neighth course:  a selection of sushi...otoro (fatty tuna), tasmanian sea trout, <mark>Sea Eel</mark>, a fish i can't recall, mirugai (geoduck), and tamago (egg omelet).  i love sushi.  i loved all of these nigiri!\n\nninth course:  shiso (?) panna cotta with strawberry \"caviar\", an understated but very satisfying closer to our meal.  the \"caviar\" was made to resemble ikura or salmon roe and was a very nice, creative touch.\n\nas for our sake, chris (i think that was his name), our lead server, informed us that nobu imports its sake from japan and that it's made especially for nobu.  i'm not an expert, at all, on the finer aspects of sake.  suffice it to say, our pairings were very nice, with subtle, yet interesting differences between each glass and went well with each dish.  chris did a great job all-around job taking care of us.  we had a very leisurely meal, never feeling rushed, but we never had to wait for our next course or glass of sake.  the timing was impeccable!\n\ni'm really not the type of person to toss out superlatives casually, but our meal was arguably one of the best meals i've ever had...at least since i've started yelping!  each dish was memorable and no single dish clearly stood out as the best since they were all outstanding!  it takes a lot of hair-splitting to even pick a dish that was less satisfying that the rest but if i had to pick one, it was the wagyu and <mark>Teppan Style Foie Gras</mark> course...and that was only due to the impression that the accompaniments on other dishes were more exciting than the sweet corn and snap peas.  if you're in vegas for one night and can only eat at one place while you're there, go to nobu and have the omakase tasting menu!  you won't regret it!", 
            "nirvana - pure nirvana. my taste buds were happy, i was very happy. \n\nmy bf too me here (my first trip) for our saturday night dinner. we knew when we walked in that we were having the omakase. i truly cannot pick out one single dish that i liked over the others - every single one was executed perfectly. our waiter was kind enough to write down what we had so we could remember. though he didn't write down the sake pairings we had - every single one of them matched perfectly with the dish. my only sadness with the sake is that i can't buy it anywhere since it is made for nobu (perhaps time to sale it at the restaurant???) \n\ncourse 1: kumomoto oysters, wrapped in <mark>Smoked Salmon</mark> with osetra caviar, served with endive <mark>Tuna (Big Eye) and Asparagus</mark> in sweet and spicy miso sauces (sweet and spicy? oysters? what is not to love?) \n\ncourse 2: <mark>Shima Aji</mark> sashimi served in tosazu gelee with micro celery and sea grapes kelp; garnished with pickled turnip (i'm not normally a turnip fan, but you could serve this to me anytime!) \n\ncourse 3: bluefin tuna sashimi topped <mark>Squid 'Pasta' with Light Garlic</mark> puree and sliced jalapeno, served <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> emulsion over brown rice salsa (okay a truly unique dish - and it was spicy! you know i like spice in my life!) \n\ncourse 4: <mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> trout and seared sweet shrimp <mark><mark>Nobu's Moriawase Sashimi Salad</mark></mark> served with mache, peppercorn, <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Whole <mark>1/2 Maine Lobster</mark></mark> <mark>Roasted Poussin with Spicy Lemon</mark></mark> dressing. (this fish was so succulent, buttery and full of flavor - if only i could find this in dc) \n\ncourse 5: pan seared seagrass, seasonal mushrooms, wild ramps, served in <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> sauce \n\ncourse 6: grilled washu beef with eared <mark>Teppan Style Foie Gras</mark>, served over yellow sweet corn and snap peas <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark>-mirin reduction \n\ncourse 7: soup with huge chunks of lobster (yup - huge); loved the little enoki mushrooms in it! \n\ncourse 8: sushi: one standout for me - salt <mark>Fresh Water Eel</mark> with this leaf that kinda tasted like basil <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Whole <mark>1/2 Maine Lobster</mark></mark> <mark>Roasted Poussin with Spicy Lemon</mark></mark> together. wow - yummy (this from the girl who wouldn't eat eel for a long time). not that the other offerings weren't good. \n\ncourse 9: dessert. panna cotta (i think) with strawberry caviar - the caviar was awesome! \n\nfinal: three types of fruit sake. my favorite was the ginger. \n\ni have to say this was one of the highlights of our trip. thoroughly enjoyed the meal and would gladly go again and again.",

            "my wife and i have been dining here for several years...time to let you know how much we love this place.  recently stopped in on our way thru vegas and ate at the bar for a different experience. i highly recommend ron the bartender.  fantastic personality, very knowledgeable and great service.  the food, as always, is tops, especially for the adventurous.  our standards, though, are the hamachi jalepeno and <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> <mark><mark>Whole <mark>1/2 Maine Lobster</mark></mark> with Wasabi Pepper</mark> sauce. i highly recommend nobu."

            "nobu would have gotten the 5th star, except for the loud music, and the decidedly non-intimate seating. my wife and i aren't opposed to answering a question about a dish, but when the folks next to you can lean over and check out what you're eating, well...i understand that that's the place's image, but it just keeps it from being a 5-star dining experience, imo.\n\nwe went on a sunday night at 7:30p. we were seated immediately, and our server brought the drink menus. my wife had the passion mojito, and i stuck with a sapporo because i'm not a huge fan of sake. the drink menu was replaced with the dinner menu, but we were pretty sure we were going to have the omakase.\n\nthere are two basic \"levels\" of omakase...each is composed of a mixture of cold dishes, hot dishes, sushi, and dessert. the lower-priced version ($100) contains more traditional dishes, and the higher priced version ($135) was said to be more \"exotic\". we both opted for the latter. i was trying to listen to the explanation of each dish and then scribble them down, so i likely missed some of the little accompaniments/garnishes. \n\n- kumamoto oyster, on the half-shell, with nobu salsa\n- sweet shrimp (sashimi-style, no rice, and no tempura head)\n- some kind of shellfish sashimi-style (either scallop or clam, i'm leaning towards scallop, based on the texture and the menu offerings)\nall three of these items were served on the same plate, the latter two with, i think, ponzu sauce. the oyster was pretty large, such that i didn't want to pick the shell up and end up wearing some of it. the sweet shrimp was very rich and quite tasty, and what i'm assuming was the scallop was a little firmer than i would expect, but still very good.\n\n- kampachi sashimi with kelp and mushroom \nkampachi is one of my favorite fish, and this did not disappoint. the kelp and mushroom, i think, were kept subtle so as not to overpower the fish...you could actually skip the kelp and mushrooms if you were trying to save room for later. \n\n- new-style unagi (lightly seared) layered with shiitake over a bed of tofu, with uni on the side\nthey have a really good sauce for the uni, because i don't like uni, and this tasted great! :) the unagi was also wonderful when prepared like this, as the meat is very tender, and no powerful marinade.\n\n- toro salad with vegetable spring roll\ni wasn't crazy about the spring roll...i thought it was bland. the toro salad, however, was very good.\n\n- green tea & ume sorbet\ni guess this was a palate cleanser? i wasn't expecting to get something like this in the middle of the meal. after the server brought it out, i told my wife, \"thank you for dining at nobu, please come back soon.\" anyway, it was not overly sweet, and would be fine as a dessert after a big meal.\n\n- broiled snapper over risotto with <mark>Snow Crab</mark> meat, topped with a white truffle chip \nthe hot dishes started with a small chunk of snapper that was done pretty much perfectly, no color, but still very juicy. the risotto was ok, nothing special, but the rice went well with the fish.\n\n- small, sliced, grilled \"kobe\" beef tenderloin with okinawa potatoes served alongside a slice of grilled japanese eggplant topped with a small piece of grilled <mark>Teppan Style Foie Gras</mark>.\ni'm going to commit heresy in a bit...i put kobe in quotes, because i hear a bunch of stories about whether or not kobe is kobe, but this tenderloin was done rare, and the potatoes went nicely with it. great dish. i don't really like eggplant, but this was ok, so they did something right. i'd never had <mark>Teppan Style Foie Gras</mark> before, and, well, meh? there, i said it.\n\n- <mark><mark>Lobster <mark>Miso Soup</mark></mark></mark> with clam\nanother break, like the sorbet. it wasn't bad or anything, but i was getting kinda full, so i almost skipped it. (almost).\n\n- nigiri sampler: oh toro, pink snapper, sardine, <mark>Snow Crab</mark>, <mark>Jumbo Clam</mark>\nthe clam was fresh and crunchy, but the <mark>Snow Crab</mark> was pretty ordinary. this was only the second time i've had sardine nigiri. i like sardine under other circumstances, but for sushi, i think it's just too oily? i couldn't tell the difference between the pink snapper and, say, fresh tai, but it was very firm and tasty. my wife told me the oh toro was awful and that i should consider letting her eat it for me, as she didn't want it to ruin my dinner. i love her very much, but in matters of sushi, she is not to be trusted. :) try the oh toro.\n\n- blancmange (yogurt, in this case) over almond crisp, pomegranate seeds, and assorted frozen berries.\nfull. i almost had to pass on dessert (almost). again, not overly sweet, which is a plus in my book, and the berries and almond crisp combined very well. \n\nthe service was tremendous, as the restaurant has a large waitstaff, so dishes are cleared away promptly, but we were not rushed. our section filled up towards the latter half of the meal, but the staff were able to keep up with no problems.\n\nif you're a fan of this type of japanese food, check it out - it's pricey, but you're in vegas, so live a little!",

            "when nobu opened in new york city, it created a sensation.  reservations were nearly impossible to get, and its new interpretation of traditional japanese food was widely praised.  this led to the inevitable branding of the restaurant; nobu can be found all over the globe.\n\nmeal #1: i found las vegas nobu's sushi highly variable.  the overall quality was ok, but some items (e.g., uni) were poor while others (e.g., ankimo) were good.  orange and honey flavored sake was interesting but probably not worth repeating.\n\n\nmeal #2:  since my first meal, i went to nobu in miami beach, sat in the dining room and had the omakase meal.  i enjoyed that a bit more, so decided to give the vegas location another shot.\n\nthe restaurant looks ok, but nothing great.  it's very noisy, in keeping with the hard rock atmosphere.  the crowd is mostly young, but i think anyone would feel comfortable here; i did.  service is pleasant, although all the servers are running around at full speed.\n\nnow, on to the meal:\n\n    * i chose jyunmai daiginjyo sake.  it wasn't bad, but was a trifle harsh.\n    * small japanese spring roll with balsamic vinaigrette reduction.  good.\n    * trio of raw seafood: sea scallop slice, oyster, ama ebi (raw shrimp).  all served with onion and other spices, although each was slightly different.  good.\n    * seared maguro and a slightly strong flavored fish, <mark>Squid 'Pasta' with Light Garlic</mark> chips and a pickled ginger shoot.  a good combination.  very good.\n    * uni (<mark>Sea Urchin</mark>) <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> white fish, served on sliced eggplant.  the uni was seared and was surprisingly delicious.  there was also a tiny river crab, to be eaten shell and all; interesting for the crunch, not the flavor.  very good.\n    * o toro and a spring roll <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> sauce and radish.  the o toro was good but a little chewy, and the strong sauce tended to overwhelm the tuna.  good to very good.\n    * palate cleanser: intensely flavored, sweet/sour mango sorbet, on top of a red granite with little flavor.\n    * service lapse.  up to this point, courses had been timed well.  at this point, i waited for about 15 minutes, with no explanation.  this was a little annoying.\n    * grilled sea scallop on a bed of mushrooms, bits of seafood, and brown rice.  very good.\n    * <mark>Teppan Style Foie Gras</mark> and kobe beef.  a large hunk of <mark>Teppan Style Foie Gras</mark>; good flavor.  kobe beef very good.  overall, very good to excellent.\n    * service lapse: the next course was supposed to be sushi, followed by <mark><mark>Lobster <mark>Miso Soup</mark></mark></mark>.  they reversed the order, and apologized later.  a minor matter.\n    * <mark><mark>Lobster <mark>Miso Soup</mark></mark></mark>.  better than average; good fish stock flavor, not too salty.  very good.\n    * sushi: o-toro (tuna belly), <mark>Shima Aji</mark> (variety of mackerel?), some kind of crab, unagi (eel).  very good.\n    * fruit papillote.  like a crepe.  the raspberry seeds were very distracting.  fair.\n    * honey <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark>.  very strong honey flavor.  strange, but i liked it.  very good.\n\noverall, the meal was good, but not as good as nobu in miami, and not nearly as good as okada.  at the price they charge ($120), they need to do better.\n\n\nmeal #3: based on past meals, i hadn't planned to return. however, i found myself at the hard rock hotel at meal time, and no other choices looked appealing. i decided to go for unusual choices, hoping this would be a strength. this worked out better. my selections:\n\n    * ankimo (steamed monkfish liver). standard but still very good.\n    * <mark>Hamachi Kama</mark> (grilled yellowtail collar). this is a chunk of fish, skin and bone, served grilled. it may not sound like much, and it's a little difficult to get the flesh out, but it's usually very rich and very tasty. i was both happy and sad with my choice: it was very good, but not as good as elsewhere. if you'd like to try this dish, order it robatayaki style at okada.\n    * live shrimp. these santa barbara shrimp were killed in front of me, so i guess that means they're fresh. they were big and rather chewy; i'm guessing the latter is due to their recent demise. the heads were served tempura style, and were juicy and tasty.\n    * live octopus. i'm not sure that it was live, but slices of the tentacle, served raw, were indeed very fresh tasting - and much less chewy than the cooked version. pretty good.\n\nthis was the most satisfying of my meals at nobu. nothing was stellar, but everything was good.\n\n\n\nnobu's strength is its new take on japanese foods.  its weaknesses are sushi that isn't in the same class with the better places in las vegas, and suspect service.  given such high prices, i'd look elsewhere.", 
            "probably the best japanese meal i've had outside of japan.  i ordered the full $125-ish tasting diner menu, plus some nice cold sake.  various intricate, colorful, and tasty dishes appear one after another.  the kobe beef and <mark>Teppan Style Foie Gras</mark> was the high-light.  i was so surprised that i was actually getting full.  but for $125, i shouldn't expect any less.\n\nthere was this nice couple sitting in the next table.  they shared their black cod on lettuce cups dish with me because they ordered too much food.  that dish was excellent.  if only that can happen more often.  \n\nas everyone says, it is strange to be located in hard rock casino.  it is not on the strip, so not as convenient to get to.  the decor seemed a little off - feels more hawaiian or tropical.  the service was friendly, and everyone seemed to be enjoying themselves.", 
            "i've been to nobu in the bahamas and miami. i honestly thought it was nearly comparable to the one in miami with one exception...\n\n<mark>Black Cod Miso</mark> cod.. loved this in miami, however it tasted slightly fishy in vegas. i think if this was the first miso cod i had ever tasted, i would have enjoyed it.... but it couldn't live up to it's miami counterpart! my bf commented the filet seemed to be cut different and not as well.. perhaps if i order it again, it will impress next time. \n\nseared <mark>Teppan Style Foie Gras</mark> special... although this place is a sushi place, this was the best thing we tasted! seared <mark>Teppan Style Foie Gras</mark> in a strawberry sauce.. shot of sake infused with raspberries and a side oftuna poke.. mmmmm. they had some dumb thing you're supposed to do where you eat some tuna, take a shot, then eat the <mark>Teppan Style Foie Gras</mark>.. this actually worked! the flavors blended beautifully. \n\nnegi-toro .. as usual, this roll was incredible. not fishy at all and very light tasting. \n\nkampachi.. incredible! one of the top 10 pieces of fish i've tasted. again, not fishy, this is key.. smooth, buttery, amazing. \n\nps- service was great.. far better than service i had in miami. the -1 star is for the disappointing miso cod.", 
            "we got the the top level omakase ($150/person chef's choice) and i will never forget it. it was the best dining experience i've ever had. first of all the waiter was very helpful, attentive, and delightful through all 10 or so dishes - they're happy to explain what everything is. the portions are small, so it's enough food that you can still eat it all. they will alter your dishes to your dietary needs (example: i can't eat shrimp - not a problem). it was extremely fun to see what dish was coming next from an assortment of cold, hot, sushi, and <mark>Dessert</mark>. my favorites were the nobu ale, the black snapper (yes black, not red), the japanese mountain peach fruit, the green tea fudge, and the <mark>Teppan Style Foie Gras</mark> that just melts in your mouth.", 
            "the visit was on a labor day sunday around 6pm.  the last visit to this particular nobu was back in 2003 when i didn't know the difference between a piece of foie and a rubber sole.  i recall having the chef special back then as well, but the omakase this time was definitely more enjoyable.  this was probably due to the fact that i wasn't three sheets to the wind this time.  being married does these things.\n\nthere were those that chose the bronze omakase ($100) and those that went for the silver ($150) like yours truly, and boy was there ever a difference.  there were major discrepancies between the cuts and also the types of meats served.  the sashimi and the speciality dishes also had noticeable differences.  it's not to say that the 100 dollar omakase wasn't good, but it wasn't great...at least from my vantage point.\n\nthere's about a zillion details i will be leaving out, such as the dried flakes of hoo-haa sprinkled with a drizzle of the thinger thang.  so use your imagination..\n\ncourse 1 - a bonito sashimi.\ncourse 2 - amaebi splashed with hot oil, chawan mushi with truffle and crab eggs at the bottom, kampachi sashimi with dried miso flakes.\ncourse 3 - toro sashimi <mark>King Crab with Amazu Ponzu</mark> ginger sauce <mark>Yellowtail and Jalapeno</mark> sauce topped with a bunch of edible flowers which made it all purdy and crap.\ncourse 4 - seared <mark>Scallop</mark> on a bed of sea beans.\ncourse 5 - kobe beef (served medium) with pan fried <mark>Teppan Style Foie Gras</mark>.\ncourse 6 - sushi set (nigiri) <mark>Inaniwa Pasta with Lobster</mark> broth and <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark>.  the set consisted of - toro, abalone, spanish mackerel, eel, tai (<mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark>) and tamago.\ncourse 7 - an array of sweets including <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark>, chocolate looking souffle thing, fresh fruits and other sugary confections we couldn't stay for because we were already late for the friggin cirque du pouffay show.\n\n..\n\nall in all, a great meal.  i enjoyed the silver omakase at matsuhisa better, the wife liked this dinner much better.  definitely a strong 4 star, but nowhere near a five.  the highlight of the meal for me was the foie served over the kobe.  the dish was so luxurious i really was at a loss for words as i was enjoying every delectable bite.  the slice of black truffle in the chawan mushi gives you a big mule kick in the face which was in short, heavenly.  \n\ni was surprised to find that i liked the non sushi dishes better than the raw, but is it such a huge surprise?  we live in cities like la, sf, ny, etc. where quality ingredients are so readily available.  i've had sashimi as good if not better in other restaurants.  most don't serve it with the detail and ingenuity like mr. nobu matsuhisa, but it takes way too much money to surprise this sushi cowboy.\n\ni truly don't mean to sound snobbish, but there's only so many ways to serve up a nice slab of toro.  i'm more impressed these days by the way chefs serve up foie.  and i am totally infatuated with bone marrow.\n\n..\n\ni've said too much.  \n\ni am off to eat.\n\nedit:\n\ni don't know if it was because we were in vegas, but i felt like everything was a bit contrived.\n\n*shrugs*", 
            "so i've been here a half dozen times in the past 6 months for birthdays and business dinners. for those that know how & what to order this is honestly the best japanese in las vegas. when i read the low star reviews it's obvious the ordering went awry, so i'm going to use this review as a class in what to get at nobu 101:\n\nfirst my dont's:\n*do not come here with a low budget in mind . you will pay over $100 pp  if you want a satisfying amazing meal. i've come in here and tried to do it \"cheap\" and walked away angry and disappointed. wait to dine here until you have the budget to do so properly. \n*do not order off the main menu . it's boring. the food isn't that great. steak is blah. tempura is blah. seriously avoid avoid avoid.\n*don't order sushi rolls.. this should go without saying!!! \n*don't blindly get the chef's omakase. you'll likely end up disappointed.\n*don't order the shit you get at your normal sushi place and compare it. order exotic cool things you can't get at home.\n\nnow for what to do!:\n*peruse the \"special\" menu and also talk to the waiter about other goodies they might have hiding in the back. literally all my great meals here have been 100% off the main menu. the off the menu items are by far the best\n*be open minded and try the interesting off the wall stuff. it will really blow you away. i've found the waiters to be really down to earth and cool here.. use them as a resource. tell them what you like/don't like and ask for recommendations ! \n\nlastly, i'll leave you with my favorites. most are off the menu. most are seasonal. yes, it's a grab bag what they'll have when you decide to dine here but honestly i've never been disappointed when ordering this way ! \n\ncold:\n*barracuda. omg. best sashimi i've had in my life. who knew!\n*tazmanian <mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark>. my next favorite. basically like a mild buttery salmon. \n*<mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> with pineapples\n*kampachi. i do prefer this prepared the yellow tail jalape\\u00f1o way instead of the yellow tail. once you've had wild yellow tail it's hard to order the normal one ever again ! \n\nhot:\n*<mark>Black Cod Miso</mark> cod lettuce wraps... with <mark>Teppan Style Foie Gras</mark>. insanely good.\n*the huge fried fish in that amazing buttery sauce. definitely not for the dieters or light eaters. get 1 of these if you have a huge group. it's big and heavy\n*quail stuffed with pork belly (as amazing as it sounds!)\n\ncliffsnotes: avoid ordering from the main menu. it's boring, uninspired and won't excite you. be brave and bold when ordering, don't come with a limited budget. enjoy!", 
            "bluf...the dining highlight of my trip to vegas with my girlfriend was our dinner at nobu.  this was my third trip to nobu, each time having had the chef's omakase tasting menu.  nobu's tasting menu is a thoughtfully composed meal served kaiseki-style (sort of a themed meal) that seeks to tie together individual dishes by attributes like taste, texture, and temperature to enhance the overall experience of the meal.  since there isn't a set menu, you select the price point you're willing to pay and the chef and the kitchen staff prepares an appropriate amount of courses using whatever exotic ingredients they deem fit.  we both received 9 courses with sake pairing. \n\nfirst course:  we started with a kumamoto oyster wrapped in <mark>Smoked Salmon</mark> topped with a osetra caviar, served on an endive leaf in an asparagus \"boat\" with accompanied by sweet <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> miso sauces.  a masterful start!  the 5 basic tastes were tastefully and elegantly captured together in a single dish! \n\nsecond course:  shima-aji sashimi served in a tosazu (vinegared sardines) gel\\u00e9e with micro celery and \"sea grapes\" kelp...garnished with pickled turnip.  a great all-around dish, but the pickle turnip was the ingredient that put it over the top!\n\nthird course:  bluefin tuna sashimi topped <mark>Squid 'Pasta' with Light Garlic</mark> pur\\u00e9e and sliced serrano chilies with jalape\\u00f1o emulsion over brown rice salsa.  i love sashimi, but the garlicky goodness and spiciness from the chilies was amazing.  the brown rice salsa was damn tasty in its own right!\n\nfourth course:  <mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> and seared sweet shrimp <mark><mark>Nobu's Moriawase Sashimi Salad</mark></mark> served with m\\u00e2che, peppercorn, <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Whole <mark>1/2 Maine Lobster</mark></mark> <mark>Roasted Poussin with Spicy Lemon</mark></mark> dressing.   another success!  the peppercorns gave it the spicy notes that greatly accented the raw fish.\n\nintermezzo:  a <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark>...a simple yet refreshing palate cleanser that marked the transition from cold dishes to hot.\n\nfifth course:  pan-seared seabass, seasonal mushrooms, and wild ramps served in a <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> sauce.  as much as i loved the seabass, the earthy mushrooms and ramps nearly stole the show in this dish!\n\nsixth course:  grilled wagyu beef with seared <mark>Teppan Style Foie Gras</mark> served over yellow sweet corn and snap peas <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark>-mirin reduction.  the oh-so-tender australian-raised wagyu beef paired nicely with the perfectly seared <mark>Teppan Style Foie Gras</mark>.  \n\nseventh course:  dashi <mark>Inaniwa Pasta with Lobster</mark> and enoki mushroom with japanese greens.  so simple, yet such an incredibly satisfying dish!  they didn't skimp on the lobster, either.  in many ways, this was my favorite dish of the night.\n\neighth course:  a selection of sushi...otoro (fatty tuna), tasmanian sea trout, <mark>Sea Eel</mark>, a fish i can't recall, mirugai (geoduck), and tamago (egg omelet).  i love sushi.  i loved all of these nigiri!\n\nninth course:  shiso (?) panna cotta with strawberry \"caviar\", an understated but very satisfying closer to our meal.  the \"caviar\" was made to resemble ikura or salmon roe and was a very nice, creative touch.\n\nas for our sake, chris (i think that was his name), our lead server, informed us that nobu imports its sake from japan and that it's made especially for nobu.  i'm not an expert, at all, on the finer aspects of sake.  suffice it to say, our pairings were very nice, with subtle, yet interesting differences between each glass and went well with each dish.  chris did a great job all-around job taking care of us.  we had a very leisurely meal, never feeling rushed, but we never had to wait for our next course or glass of sake.  the timing was impeccable!\n\ni'm really not the type of person to toss out superlatives casually, but our meal was arguably one of the best meals i've ever had...at least since i've started yelping!  each dish was memorable and no single dish clearly stood out as the best since they were all outstanding!  it takes a lot of hair-splitting to even pick a dish that was less satisfying that the rest but if i had to pick one, it was the wagyu and <mark>Teppan Style Foie Gras</mark> course...and that was only due to the impression that the accompaniments on other dishes were more exciting than the sweet corn and snap peas.  if you're in vegas for one night and can only eat at one place while you're there, go to nobu and have the omakase tasting menu!  you won't regret it!", 
            "nirvana - pure nirvana. my taste buds were happy, i was very happy. \n\nmy bf too me here (my first trip) for our saturday night dinner. we knew when we walked in that we were having the omakase. i truly cannot pick out one single dish that i liked over the others - every single one was executed perfectly. our waiter was kind enough to write down what we had so we could remember. though he didn't write down the sake pairings we had - every single one of them matched perfectly with the dish. my only sadness with the sake is that i can't buy it anywhere since it is made for nobu (perhaps time to sale it at the restaurant???) \n\ncourse 1: kumomoto oysters, wrapped in <mark>Smoked Salmon</mark> with osetra caviar, served with endive <mark>Tuna (Big Eye) and Asparagus</mark> in sweet and spicy miso sauces (sweet and spicy? oysters? what is not to love?) \n\ncourse 2: <mark>Shima Aji</mark> sashimi served in tosazu gelee with micro celery and sea grapes kelp; garnished with pickled turnip (i'm not normally a turnip fan, but you could serve this to me anytime!) \n\ncourse 3: bluefin tuna sashimi topped <mark>Squid 'Pasta' with Light Garlic</mark> puree and sliced jalapeno, served <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> emulsion over brown rice salsa (okay a truly unique dish - and it was spicy! you know i like spice in my life!) \n\ncourse 4: <mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> trout and seared sweet shrimp <mark><mark>Nobu's Moriawase Sashimi Salad</mark></mark> served with mache, peppercorn, <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Whole <mark>1/2 Maine Lobster</mark></mark> <mark>Roasted Poussin with Spicy Lemon</mark></mark> dressing. (this fish was so succulent, buttery and full of flavor - if only i could find this in dc) \n\ncourse 5: pan seared seagrass, seasonal mushrooms, wild ramps, served in <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> sauce \n\ncourse 6: grilled washu beef with eared <mark>Teppan Style Foie Gras</mark>, served over yellow sweet corn and snap peas <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark>-mirin reduction \n\ncourse 7: soup with huge chunks of lobster (yup - huge); loved the little enoki mushrooms in it! \n\ncourse 8: sushi: one standout for me - salt <mark>Fresh Water Eel</mark> with this leaf that kinda tasted like basil <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Whole <mark>1/2 Maine Lobster</mark></mark> <mark>Roasted Poussin with Spicy Lemon</mark></mark> together. wow - yummy (this from the girl who wouldn't eat eel for a long time). not that the other offerings weren't good. \n\ncourse 9: dessert. panna cotta (i think) with strawberry caviar - the caviar was awesome! \n\nfinal: three types of fruit sake. my favorite was the ginger. \n\ni have to say this was one of the highlights of our trip. thoroughly enjoyed the meal and would gladly go again and again.", 
            "my first and second visits here were hands down 5 stars. the food was delicious and interesting, and the atmosphere was pleasant. my third and possibly last trip was mediocre. they have opened up a new club at the hard rock, and the crowd was a bit too loud and lively for a fine dining restaurant. their <mark>Teppan Style Foie Gras</mark> was delicious, but their sushi wasn't as good as previous trips. if i go again, i'm likely to stick to their hot dishes.", 
            "nobu was my first experience at a michelin rated restaurant (one star).\n\nomakase is the japanese term for trusting the chef to come up with an enjoyable meal whether it's sushi or a classic european cuisine.  it's an exciting way to try the more creative and special dishes from the chef's knife.  it requires about two hours for dinner but well worth the time.  when you order, you'll be asked about allergies and this is a good time to mention the types of seafood that you don't like.\n\nif your party is four or less, i recommend siting at the sushi bar.  we luckily sat in good view of the lead sushi chef and watched his amazing knife and prep skills.  he was very focused in his tasks but explained each round of courses personally.  there is a high level of construction/presentation involved with each dish so i was in awe of his techniques.\n\none really surprising thing was the appearance of black caviar, white truffle slices, kobe beef, and <mark>Teppan Style Foie Gras</mark> during the run of courses.  all those fantastic flavors in one sitting.  my friends and i opted for the $150 per person course.  there is a $200 option too.\n\nhaving lived in the seattle area most of my life, i've been able to enjoy really good sushi restaurants.  however, i was astounded by how good the dishes are at nobu.  insanely good flavors and worth the price jump."

            "matsuhisa nobu, i salute you! your food is divine. i am jealous of your restaurant's decor. i envy your river stone wall. i wish i was a celebrity so i wouldn't have to wait so damn long to eat in your wickedly awesome dining establishment! i simultaneously loathe and love you...in a platonic sort of way, of course...\n\nnobu (in the hard rock hotel & casino) is one of my all-time favorite restaurants. i've also been to matsuhisa's in los angeles, but there's nothing like the nobu experience. it's vegas baby!!\n\nanyway, i've found that it's so much easier to make reservations at nobu if you're actually staying in the hotel (which is awesome, by the way). one of my college roommates' sisters used to work there and hooked me up with a discounted suite on two occasions...score! it also doesn't help if you're pretty slick with the pass-the-twenty-as-you-shake-the-host/hostess'-hand-in-order-to-get-a-table-faster bit. never worked for me...kept dropping the money...\n\nback to the food: pricey? abso-friggin'-lutely! take one look at the place. nice furniture, kitschy bamboo sake bottles and cups, rice paper wall paneling, indoor bamboo plants, wall inlaid with black river stones, huge sushi bar, and you mustn't forget about the main ingredient: location, location, location. the hard rock is practically a sure-fire way to keep this place packed with gorgeous-looking people. they need some way to pay the rent, right?\n\nbut is the food tasty? hells to the yeah, it is! every single dish i've ever had here has been delicious...even the ones that i'm usually not too keen on were better than other places (mirugai for example: here = tasty; other sushi places = like chewing on a salted piece of bicycle tire). the sea bass is prepared very well (nice and moist, flaky too), the rock shrimp is fried to perfection, the sashimi is beautifully presented, and the tataki is to die for...*sigh* if only i could be there right now... their <mark>Dessert</mark> are just as good as their appetizers and entrees. the last time i was there they had a passion fruit sorbet that could knock you out with its incredible flavor (oooh...my mouth's watering just thinking about it...and now i've drooled on my keyboard...how embarrassing...).\n\nas i mentioned before, this place can get pricey. but, if you have the funds and the stomach for it, you have to go with the omakase (chef's choice). tip: let your server know what you're partial to and what doesn't exactly float your boat in the food department (i'm not a big fan of uni (<mark>Sea Urchin</mark>), so i let 'em know that...thanks nobu!). i believe there are different levels to the omakase dinner, too...at least there was the last time i visited. but, if omakase's not the thing for you, go a la carte...that way you can try a variety of nobu's offerings. it's all up to you.\n\nsince nobu's in a vegas hot-spot, be prepared for celebrity sightings as well. the first time i ate there, my wife and i were seated next to a group of porn stars (they had to be with their excessively tight and skimpy clothing, the gratuitous cleavage (both male and female), the over-tanned, near-leather quality to their skin, and (of course) the cowboy hats!) c'mon! who wears a cowboy hat in a japanese restaurant while wearing practically nothing?! porn stars! that's who! i also walked past ex-san francisco 49er quarterback jeff garcia, kansas city chiefs tight end tony gonzalez, enrique iglesias, and enrique iglesias' mole (pre-divorce, that is).\n\nevery visit to nobu is like dinner and a show! i think that alone gives me my money's worth.", 
            "believe it or not, i think nobu vegas stands out as the best nobu venue in the u.s. i've done the omakatse menu (degustation) several times, and each time, it has been almost totally different, with each course being innovative, surprising, and most importantly, delicious. while kobe beef may be hard to mess up (though certainly not impossible :p), nobu delivers it perfectly in several different preparations. from tartar, to seared fillet, to wok fried, it's always decadent and flavorful. the sushi is ridiculously fresh and well presented, as are the salads and <mark>Dessert</mark>. the staff does just an amazing job describing every ingredient in every course in great detail, explaining where everything is grown, what flavors it's chosen for, and it's history. simply amazing. \n\ntheir sake list is diverse and excellent, and nobu has the best cold sakes i've ever had. i've had the chance to have some blind horizontal tastings, and yk-35 always wound up as being my favorite.", 
            "hubby's review is 2 stars.  here's what he has to say....\n\nfood was slightly better than ok.  \nprices were too fucking expensive!  \nwould never go back.   \n\nhere's what i have to say....3.5 stars\n\ni'm a lot more wordy than hubby so get ready....\n\nour waiter was snooty.  the prices are beyond outrageous.  the menu was extremely complicated.  i am no japanese dining expert, but i've eaten at my fair share of japanese restaurants from fine dining to hole in the wall and for the life of me i could not figure out how to order off of this menu...even after asking the waiter a barage of questions.  it didn't help that we were dining with 2 other couples, one of which did not want to be there, and half of the other couple didn't even like japanese food...don't ask.  i digress.  \n\nthe food we did figure out how to order was pretty damn good.  the rolls were good, the tuna sashimi fresh and delicious, the tempura was cooked perfectly....and the chili beef and teryiaki chicken all very good.  \n\nbut the 2 best parts about nobu for me were the belini martini's (i had two to kick off my night of martinis) and the <mark>Bento Box</mark> dessert.  the dessert was absolutely heavenly.  a flourless chocolate cake filled with a warm ooozy chocolate sauce topped with fresh raspberries and served with a scoop of green tea <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark>, it was one of the best <mark>Dessert</mark> i have ever had!  \n\nit's too bad hubby says he won't go back. i think if we had ordered differently and accepted the fact that it costs a small fortune to dine here, we might get to a good solid 4 stars.", 
            "yum. the best tempura(so light and crispy) ever and great <mark>Dessert</mark>. yeah, it's pricey and the seats could be more comfortable, but i still loved it.", 
            "we got the the top level omakase ($150/person chef's choice) and i will never forget it. it was the best dining experience i've ever had. first of all the waiter was very helpful, attentive, and delightful through all 10 or so dishes - they're happy to explain what everything is. the portions are small, so it's enough food that you can still eat it all. they will alter your dishes to your dietary needs (example: i can't eat shrimp - not a problem). it was extremely fun to see what dish was coming next from an assortment of cold, hot, sushi, and <mark>Dessert</mark>. my favorites were the nobu ale, the black snapper (yes black, not red), the japanese mountain peach fruit, the green tea fudge, and the <mark>Teppan Style Foie Gras</mark> that just melts in your mouth.", 
            "this was the first time ever i've dined with three other yelpers so i'm curious to see where the other reviews come in. personally, four stars is a little high but i really enjoyed three dishes and didn't dislike anything so i'll give it four, albeit unenthusiastically. (i don't think i've ever typed a longer word than \"unenthusiastically\").\n\nthe black cod <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark> was the highlight. the kobe beef was amazing too but we all misread the menu and when that showed up at $192 i'd call it hands down the most overpriced thing i've ever eaten. the <mark>Scallop</mark> topped <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> were the third great dish. the sushi was fine though nothing spectacular.\n\nthe ambiance is surprisingly boring, especially for vegas. it looks the way a japanese restaurant might if designed by the high-school drama department - all cheap bamboo reeds and sloppy wood structures. and the service, though efficient, was humorless. any waitress who can't understand the genius in asking if there are any beef-based <mark>Dessert</mark> off the menu is not winning any points with me.\n\nstill, the price minus the kobe was totally reasonable, especially for vegas. and the matsuhisa martinis go a long way toward <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> up to a pretty good meal.", 
            "i don't know about the ny or la counterparts, but......\n\nnobu lv must be the biggest scam in the history of fine dining.  i really wanted to like it because i didn't want to seem like a hater but seriously the decor is so uninspired (surfboards, bamboo, modern-classic clash) and the wait staff doesn't have the same refined elegance or grace as comparably priced restaurants.  just cuz you put on a black t-shirt and black slacks doesn't make it chic and modern -- unless you're steve jobs.\n\nwe had the <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> which was genius -- at least for the accountants.  the live scallop was sour and spicy but just too much of each.  the moi new sashimi special could have been any fish.  the miso cod was tasty and one of the highlights, but was served lukewarm.  the uni tempura dish was also pretty good but you only get 1 piece of uni.  the <mark>Bento Box</mark> and yuzu wasabi <mark>Dessert</mark> were ok too.\n\nwould i dine there if the food was 1/3 the price?  sure.  i just felt like i was getting duped and i wanted to scream out the king ain't wearing any clothes you idiots.  but then i realized between the loud noise of hard rock and the drunken stupor of the crowd , my efforts would be moot.", 
            "ate at nobu in vegas last night and what an amazing experience we had.  we had the omakase experience, started with cold dishes to warm entree to heavy appetizer and finished off with a few of their special <mark>Dessert</mark>.  starters: <mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> sashimi with dried miso, olive oil and yuzu; <mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> and cilantro; <mark>Scallop</mark> and <mark>Black Cod Miso</mark> lettuce wraps; pink snapper with pineapple and tomatoes. for warm dishes: chilean sea bass <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> crust and <mark>Tenderloin of Beef</mark> braised <mark>Kumamoto Oyster with <mark>Bone in Ribeye 24oz Nobu Sauce</mark></mark> on a bed of south american yam; <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark> presented in 3 different sauces.  to finish off the meal, chelf sent a platter of 4 special <mark>Dessert</mark>.  always make room for dessert!!!", 
            "okay. amazing. got omakase, but not just omakase....\n\ndebated going here since we're vegans... thought i might have fish for the first time in over 4 years then decided against it and canceled our reservations. but then the night we stayed in the hard rock hotel and walked by the joint?.... well.... here's how it went down:\n\nwe stopped to just check out the menu to see what veg options were even available. the hostess and host were wondering what we were contemplating and why... we told them that we were veg and everyone at the hostess station said 'no problem!! come in, vegetarians here all the time!!'... but then we followed that up with 'well, we're actually vegans.....' to which one waiter said 'let me check with the chef, i'll be right back.' \n\napparently the kitchen 'wanted the challenge'.... so in we went!\n\nsat down and decided to order the omakase meal. usually this consists of six plates plus dessert but we actually got eight and two <mark>Dessert</mark> (one each, two different <mark>Dessert</mark>)... can i say amazing?! the food that the kitchen came up with was amazing. we actually were stuffed by the time the sixth course of food came around (and we thought last!) but two more came. by the time dessert was served we didn't think we could fit anymore into our stomachs. but we \"managed\" :)\n\nfood, service, everything was impeccable. def would highly recommend a visit. worth every penny!! very impressed with what they came up with for us as well.", 
            "seriously delicious!  the first time i went to a sushi place and didn't have any rolls or rice!  we didn't order but had the waiter bring out their best dishes and everything was absolutely amazing!  the cod wraps and crab and rockshrimp were my favorite as well as their signature <mark>Yellowtail and Jalapeno</mark> dish.  they put together a spread of their <mark>Dessert</mark>, so got a little taste of everything.  oh and had the best riesling ever!  i will post pictures of their best dishes!\n\nand even though the chef was busy, he did come out to greet us which was really nice!\n\ni would highly recommend and want to go back!", 
            "i came here for dinner with a large group, and they never gave us a hard time about last minute changes on the size of the group. \n\nour waiter was attentive, patient, and gave great recommendations, and it was easy to get helped, even though we were seated allll the way in the back of the restaurant. \n\ni had the <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> and the miso cod, and between all the folks at our table, i tasted a pretty good portion of the menu, including <mark>Dessert</mark>, and nothing was bad. \n\nwhen i go back, i'm getting the <mark>Colorado Lamb Chops</mark> or the miso cod. can't wait. vegas anyone?", 
            "best meal ever!!!! came here for my friends bachlorette party since it was being paid for by another friends boyfriend. gotta love a high roller!\nso there were 13 of us in our party & they were jumping through hoops for us. the service was the best i have ever had in vegas.\nwe decided to let the chef make us his best stuff and boy are we glad we did. the amazing food just kept coming out. there were so many dishes it was hard to keep track. my favorite was the black cod and the lobster. \nwe had bubbly flowing & so much sake i could barely get up without falling over!\nthe bill ended up being over 3 grand for 13 people with endless drinks & endless food & <mark>Dessert</mark>.\nby far the best meal i have ever had the pleasure of eating & it didnt cost me a thing. bonus!\nits good to be a woman...", 
            "let me preface this review by saying that i'm a huge self-admitted sushi <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> and my husband is peruvian, so nobu seemed a logical choice for our 7th anniversary dinner.  aside from the villainous penny slots  just outside the door, it was the perfect choice. \n\nwe started out with the <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark>.  yellowtail is by far my favorite raw fish and i've had a similar dish at several excellent bay area restaurants, but this was by far the most flavorful rendering of this dish that i've had. the sashimi was also not razor thin which was an awesome <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> bonus (honestly, i've gotten use to the fact that fine dining, particularly in vegas, means small portions and high prices so the amount of fish was a pleasant surprise. \n\nnext, we tried the tiradito nobu style <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> type of halibut like fish.  now, here the fish was razor thin, but came out with a dot of rocoto, a block of rock salt, the traditional lime juice and a side of cilantro.  my husband says this is exactly what tiradito is supposed to taste like, which makes me want to spend significantly more time in peru.  it was amazing.\n\nwe then moved on to the <mark>Black Cod Miso</mark> next and honestly, this was the only part of the meal that i was underwhelmed by.  i know that this is supposed to be the signature hot dish at nobu, but i've had a very similar dish at both morimoto napa and at hyakumi at cesar's palace and the texture of the fish wasn't the melt in your mouth awesomeness that i have come to expect from the dish. the flavor was right on, and if i'd never had black cod before, i would have loved it.  \n\nso, we moved back to the cold dishes and tried the <mark>White Fish <mark>Scallop <mark>Salmon <mark>Oyster <mark>Beef <mark>Yuba Sashimi New Style</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark> salmon sashimi (<mark>White Fish <mark>Scallop <mark>Salmon <mark>Oyster <mark>Beef <mark>Yuba Sashimi New Style</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark> because it's served with ginger, <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> other amazing deliciousnesss that i can't recall right now), finishing off the savory with the toro green onion maki (cut).  they were both amazing. \n\nwhat shocked me was how incredibly amazing the two <mark>Dessert</mark> we had were.  we tried the <mark>Bento Box</mark>, a flourless chocolate cake with house-made green tea <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark>, and this peach cobbler like dish with almond miso crumble and ginger <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark>.  i don't know if anyone else finds some green tea <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark> to sometimes taste vaguely like lipstick, but this <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark> was delicate and a beautiful companion to the rich chocolate cake.  the warm peaches with the crumble and (again not overpowering) ginger <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark> was a highlight of my whole trip to vegas.  (and i'm not really a dessert person)\n\nokay, this review is way too long, and i didn't even mention the impeccable service.  i can't wait to go back and wish there was a nobu in the bay area.", 
            "nobu is like a foodie dream come true. first off, the ambiance was lovely---the noise level was definitely on the high side but i didn't mind. we had a group of 5 people so we ordered several small plates. we started off with two cold dishes: oysters and <mark>Yellowtail Belly</mark> special. hot dishes: <mark>Shrimp or <mark>Scallop</mark> with Wasabi Pepper or Spicy Garlic</mark> and kobe beef gyoza. and different varieties of sushi afterwards. you really can't go wrong with any of these. the <mark>Dessert</mark> were truly a revelation and the perfect way to end the meal: yuzu panna cotta with raspberry mango caviar and raspberry sorbet; flourless chocolate molten cake with green tea <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark>; and the miso brioche/apple donuts with caramel sauce. i won't bother using any adjectives like \"delicious\" or \"amazing\" because i think the descriptions speak for themselves. end of story.", 
            "7/2: nobu hard rock rivals yellowtail @bellagio as my all-time favorite restaurant. i've been here one previous time and i don't remember much, but nothing bad. i just kept comparing it to my favorite, which is kind of unfair. however, this time was different...very memorable in a good way. \n\nmy server gordon and his waitstaff team's service was amazing! i had the locals tasting menu ($75) and it was worth every penny. every dish was cordially described in just the right amount of detail before being served. all questions were answered in a friendly manner. the atmosphere was very nice and classy as well. beautiful decor. \n\n-kobe beef taco (as an appetizer, separate from tasting menu)...best taco ever! beef was soft and moist\n\n-<mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> (best sashimi i've ever had by far! so soft and fresh. price tag aside, i could go for 10 of these plates! though that might be too much of a good thing)\n-tuna <mark><mark>Nobu's Moriawase Sashimi Salad</mark></mark> (love it. best tuna ever) \n-rock <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark> with creamy spicy (best shrimp ever...you're getting the point! i didnt know shrimp could taste this good) \n-<mark>Black Cod Miso</mark> (this and the yellowtail sashimi were my favorite dishes...high praise for these 2 seems to be the trend based off of many reviews. definitely no disagreement here. best fish ever! if you are ordering one item, i highly recommend it) \n-assorted sushi and <mark><mark>Lobster <mark>Miso Soup</mark></mark></mark> (basics but pretty good. large <mark>Scallop</mark> were <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> to the soup. unique taste and interesting twist compared to standard <mark><mark>Lobster <mark>Miso Soup</mark></mark></mark>. delicious!) \n-dessert (strawberry, vanilla, green tea <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark>)...all were great. not really a complaint, but a variety of <mark>Dessert</mark> is preferred. im sure they would be amazing like everything else as well.\n\nthank you nobu, for one of the best dining experiences ever. i will definitely be back!", 
            "had dinner here last night with friends and been here two other times.  everything is always fresh and creative.  once you get past the sticker shock you realize it's vegas and all nice restaurants cost an arm and a leg.  it's an experience though so just go with it.  we had <mark><mark>Lobster <mark>Miso Soup</mark></mark></mark>, beef and <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> tacos, <mark>King Crab Ceviche</mark>, shrimp and <mark>Scallop Tempura</mark>, some <mark>Dessert</mark>, and of course sake.  also, tons of sashimi including yelliowtail, tuna, <mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark>, wild yellowtail, and <mark>Snow Crab</mark>.  all awesome.  the service was great, the place is very nice, and the food is always great and fresh.", 
            "i would give this place a million stars, but it only goes up to 5.  my husband and i were staying at the hard rock hotel & casino on our honeymoon, and received a gift card to nobu, at our request, from my sister-in-law.  i've heard nothing but good things, and they were all true.  we chose the omakase menu option.  we had 9 courses each, and the dessert came with three different items, for each of us.  we spent just under $400 after the tip for both of us, and it was worth every penny.  the service and food was absolutely impeccable.  our server was amazing.  the manager came out to our table personally and presented us with the gift card my sister-in-law had purchased prior, over the phone.  he also provided us with complimentary glasses of champagne.  i am terrible at naming cuisine that i don't normally eat, so can't remember specifically all items we had, but for certain, the yellowtail tartare w/ caviar, the <mark>Mushroom Soup</mark>, the black cod w/ miso, the wagyu beef and the chocolate molten cake, green tea <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark> and cappucino <mark>Dessert</mark> were so delicious.  i have not one bad thing to say about the food or service at this place.  nobu at the hard rock is a gem in the middle of a loud and crazy city.  this meal was the highlight of our dining experience on our week-long honeymoon in vegas.  i would eat here every single day if i could.", 
            "my second time dining at nobu and once again it was great. some of the best sushi in vegas . the waiter was amazing . he was very knowledgable and recommended some great options. the yellowtail sashimi was great, we had to order 3 servings. the eel roll was great. we ordered a filet that came out in a covered sizzling skillet and it was cooked to perfection . the manager came and greeted us at the table and brought 3 <mark>Dessert</mark>. the banana <mark>Ice Cream or Sorbet</mark> was great. i'll be back next time i'm in town", 
            "there's a groupon for nobu?!! whaaaat!?! yes, believe it! i had purchased a groupon for a 5 course tasting menu for $80 for 2 people. and my bf was super excited because he has been wanting to try this place for a while now. it was actually perfect timing that this groupon became available because i was going to be in vegas this weekend. *woot woot!* anyways, i made reservations for 2 at 6pm online and got an e-mail confirmation right away. the groupon can only be used at the nobu inside the hard rock hotel. there's also a nobu inside caeser's palace. once we checked in with the hostesses, we were immediately seated at a nice comfy table and were greeted with a big welcome in japanese! the decor inside was really nice and elegant. i really liked the bamboo wall they had. i also thought it was really cute that we each had a rock on our table used as a chopstick holder. \n\nok onto the food! so we started off <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> edamame with sea salt, which was nothing too special but was good. next came the best sashimi i had ever had in my life! its yellowtail sashimi with a jalapeno slice on top dressed in almost like a ponzu sauce. the flavors went really well together and the yellowtail was fresh and spicy. yumm!!! i can probably eat like five more of that dish. :p the next dish was also another one of their popular dishes: the <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark>. i was really surprised that the shrimp didn't look at all like the usual tempura found at japanese restaurants. the dish almost looked like honey walnut shrimp actually but tasted ten times better. it was rich and creamy. and the sauce it was covered in was deliscious. next came their black cod dish. my bf absolutely loved this one and i can see why. it was so flakey and cooked to perfection. the fish melted in our mouths like butter and it was sweet and savory. next came a plate of sushi, which consisted of a califonia roll and 6 pieces of sashimi sushi. this dish was nothing too fancy and didn't stand out too much. but it was still tasty. and lastly we got our dessert! it was such a cute looking dessert, which composed of a green tea ice-cream, a flourless chocolate cake, and a cuppacino cup. omg...so good!!! the green tea ice-cream is made in house and  after one bite and you definetely know it's green tea ice-cream. the cuppacino cup was probably my favorite out of the other 2 <mark>Dessert</mark> because it was so beautifully crafted and tasted heavenly. the chocolate cake was very fluffy and not too sweet. overall, everything we tried was excellent! the reason why i subtracted 1 star was because both my bf and i felt that the cod and the shrimp was slightly on the saltier side and all of the dishes are pretty small plates to share between 2 people. otherwise, customer service here was superb and our server was just so friendly and informative on the dishes we were trying. i'm so happy to get to try nobu for the first time! =) so go get your groupon, while it's still available peeps!!", 
            "i have always wanted to try nobu and finally went! and it was worth the wait let me tell you! we went for my bday and did not have a reservation. we got there pretty early around 5ish so they were able to sit us without a res. our waiter jeffrey was on point. best service. he recommended we start with the <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark>. it was melt in my mouth amazing. i could live off the dish for the rest of my life. lol. it was yellowtail with the right amount of sweetness and spice. we also got the cucumber salad which was pretty good. a lot of the vinegar did go to the bottom of the bowl which made it hard to coat your salad but it was still good. we also had a sear salmon sashimi which i do not remember the name that was excellent. we got spicy edamame, <mark>Beef Kushiyaki</mark>, the black cod <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark> and the wagyu beef gyoza. the cod was really good and highly recommended. the wagyu beef was great with two dipping sauces. we literally could have kept ordering food. we had a couple of nice cocktails as well. \n\nafter dinner they brought us out a plate with happy birthday with a choc cake and green <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark>. we also ordered the whiskey moose. both <mark>Dessert</mark> were to die for and i was in heaven. \n\nwhat a fun place to go. you have people dressed to the max, casual people, people from all over the world that come and eat here. come chow down some amazing eats, listen to some funky music and watch the beautiful people. yes please!"

            "first impression: cheap chopsticks! really? i don't want to taste wood while i'm eating expensive food. \n\nthe waiter, billy, was great! even though i couldn't hear half of the things he was saying, he was really into the presentation and food. the atmosphere was loud so i could not hear. \n\nwe were two people on a romantic vacation. we both decided to get one of the chefs <mark>Daily Seafood Selection</mark> and one of the creations where they choose from the existing menu. my dining partner also elected to get the <mark>Sake Flight</mark> - a presentation of a carefully selected sake to accompany the dish they select for you. everything was great! we both have our favorites and preferences, but not having been there before, it was nice to have someone else choose the better dishes. i expected to leave hungry. instead, i was so full i thought i was going to die. could have done without the final sushi dishes or dessert. this trip was meant to be a search for interesting food. i think we were pleasantly interested. just two suggestions: go lighter on the sauces. good fish does not need to be covered up with a heavy sauce. secondly, change the decor. wooden tables and cheap wooden chopsticks leave you with a sense of the mediocre not extravagant."

            "if we overlook the fact that the restaurant wrote down our reservation for 10 for the wrong night, my group's dining experience here was exceptional and we were pleased that they were still able to seat us despite this error. the service was incredibly fast (3 people from our group were late and we completely finished our meal by the time they arrived,) and the food was fabulous. the flavors were crisp, unique, and every bite of food was like an explosion in my mouth. since we shared all the dishes we ordered, that pretty much means that we only got one bite so we savored it for all that it was worth. damn you nobu for being so expensive! otherwise i would have ordered 2 of everything!\n\na couple of dishes i would recommend trying are:\n-<mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark>\n-toro tartar <mark>Yellowtail or Salmon <mark>Blue Fin <mark>Toro Tartare</mark> with Royal Ossetra Caviar</mark></mark>\n-black cod <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark>\n-rock <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark>\n-new zealand mussels with the garlic sauce\n\n***the must try dish is the fish/<mark>Lobster <mark>Tuna <mark>King Crab <mark>Vegetable <mark>Salmon Nobu Style Taco</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark>!!!***\nthey are not on the menu here, but you can special order them and they are awesome. i have pictures to prove it.",

            "this was the first time ever i've dined with three other yelpers so i'm curious to see where the other reviews come in. personally, four stars is a little high but i really enjoyed three dishes and didn't dislike anything so i'll give it four, albeit unenthusiastically. (i don't think i've ever typed a longer word than \"unenthusiastically\").\n\nthe black cod <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark> was the highlight. the kobe beef was amazing too but we all misread the menu and when that showed up at $192 i'd call it hands down the most overpriced thing i've ever eaten. the <mark>Scallop</mark> topped <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> were the third great dish. the sushi was fine though nothing spectacular.\n\nthe ambiance is surprisingly boring, especially for vegas. it looks the way a japanese restaurant might if designed by the high-school drama department - all cheap bamboo reeds and sloppy wood structures. and the service, though efficient, was humorless. any waitress who can't understand the genius in asking if there are any beef-based <mark>Dessert</mark> off the menu is not winning any points with me.\n\nstill, the price minus the kobe was totally reasonable, especially for vegas. and the matsuhisa martinis go a long way toward <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> up to a pretty good meal.", 
            "very very good. hard to say that it lived up to the hype, but i thought the omakase was good value for $100. i went with my parents and they also ordered the omakase. the waiter tempted us with the $150 omakase containing \"dishes not on the menu\", but being our first time at nobu, we went with the cheaper omakase. the dishes (as best as i can remember from my pics), in order: (cold-hot-sushi-soup-dessert)\n\n1) toro with spicy miso and caviar - wow, definitely one of the highlights of the omakase. super juicy, melt-in-your-mouth toro topped with a bit of caviar and sitting in a nice spicy miso sauce. omg so good. there was an interesting tiny japanese peach on the side to cleanse the palate.\n\n2) hawaiian <mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> sashimi - very nice texture and mix of flavors with the a citrus sauce, spot of spicy sauce, a sprinkle of black sea salt, and . not sure if it's on the regular menu, maybe it's called something else.\n\n3) kampachi and <mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> sashimi - super exotic and tasty. i didn't even know what kampachi was until i looked it up. apparently it's hawaiian yellowtail farmed in the open ocean off the kona coast of the big island. the trout was also very good. it looks a bit like salmon, but tastes a lot better. served with a nice miso-based sauce (i think) on the side, a couple small veggie sushi rolls, a roasted jalapeno, and a small, yellow, pear-shaped tomato sliced in half.\n\n4) black cod w/ miso - this dish really did live up to the hype. i was about to order it separately in case it did not come with the omakase, but our waiter said it is normally included in the $100 omakase since it's a very popular dish. omg so good. such delicate flavors and texture. amazing. i normally don't like to eat fish skin, but this skin is super good and flavorful. the cod is very light and flaky, but not dry. wow, this is a must try if you come to nobu.\n\n5) beef tenderloin w/ shiitake mushroom <mark>Tuna (Big Eye) and Asparagus</mark> - i didn't think this was that special and probably would not order off the regular menu. it was very good tenderloin though, cooked to a perfect medium rare, with a light sauce. it is served in a sizzling mini cast iron plate.\n\n6) nigiri sushi platter - delicious nigiri, super fresh, and most pieces i normally wouldn't order myself, but were interesting to try. tuna (best i've had in awhile), <mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark>, aji, giant clam, and sweet shrimp. mmm\n\n7) <mark><mark>Lobster <mark>Miso Soup</mark></mark></mark> w/ clams - pretty standard <mark><mark>Lobster <mark>Miso Soup</mark></mark></mark> with a few clams inside. the clams and miso is a good combination, but they can be tricky to fish out and eat with only chopsticks. i cheated on one of them and used two fingers to hold the shell. ;p\n\n8) flourless chocolate cake w/ green tea <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark> - a generous portion served in a cute <mark>Bento Box</mark>. nothing too spectacular or interesting, but delicious nonetheless. the cake was still nice and molten inside when it arrived. yum!\n\na pretty filling flight of dishes for $100. i thought it was good value to try many dishes, but i haven't seen the sizes of the normal dishes. many tables around us also ordered the omakase, as i heard the same descriptions being recited by the staff over and over. i over heard a table of french tourists behind us ordering california rolls, chicken teriyaki, tempura, and other generic stuff you can get anywhere. sigh, what a waste.\n\ni would recommend not to order anything not on the \"hot\" of \"cold\" specialty pages of the menu. the rest is basically traditional japanese fare you can get anywhere, but will probably taste better and cost a lot more at nobu. service was good, polite, and attentive. it was a bit odd when our waiter brought out the first few dishes, and then a couple other different guys brought out some of the following ones. weird.\n\nthe decor is basic, but nothing too special. the sushi bar looks cool and there's a pretty wall of bamboo poles at the back as you walk in. my parents like to eat early, so we moved our reservation to 6pm when they are supposed to open. when we arrived a few minutes early, the door was locked and they didn't seem ready yet. ten minutes later, they were ready. better to come early though, or your omakase may take two hours or longer to get through. ours took about 90 minutes because it wasn't that crowded until after 7.\n\ni think the tenderloin and dessert could have been better and more creative. otherwise, nearly flawless.\n\nif i ever return for a special occasion, i will definitely need to try the $150 omakase. with the economy in shambles, i kinda feel bad eating such an expensive dinner. for<mark>Tuna (Big Eye)</mark>, my parents picked up the tab tonight as i had paid last night at the painted pony. maybe in 2009 they will have a recession special, like gray's papaya. ;p", 
            "wow. i was seriously impressed with this place. this place ranks second to french laundry on my list of favorites. \n\nfirst- if you are a first time visitor there, i would recommend just ordering off of the menu. i am sure the omakase is great but you have to try the signature dishes- and you may not get to try them all with the omakase. \n\nsecond- don't have the sushi be your primary focus. it's okay- but the other items are so much better. we saw people around us doing nothing but order sushi- what a waste! \n\nthird- the warm dishes tended to be larger portions than the cold and raw dishes. just a fyi if you want to budget your appetite and your wallet. i also felt that the dishes with a tart factor (see below) were too overwhelming. i would pass on these- imo the tartness is so much you can't enjoy the other flavors that might be there. \n\nwe started with edammame and the sheshito peppers. pass on the edamamme - there is nothing great about it- and you don't need to fill up your tummy with average stuff. the sheshito peppers were really good. they taste like small green bell peppers and the miso and sesame sauce on top has a great flavor. my husband is so picky when it comes to veggies and he even enjoyed this. my only word of caution- occasionally you get a spicy one! \n\nso we relied on our fellow yelpers and ordered the following items: \n\n1. <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> - definitely get this- it was awesome! \n\n2. the blackened miso cod- by far, the highlight of the evening \n\n3. chilean sea bass- cooked the special of the day way (yummy)- it had tomatoes, and onions, some white wine sauce \n\n4. kobe beef on skewers- pass- it was okay but not great \n\n5. <mark><mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark></mark>- pass- the tartness was way too overwhelming \n\n6. red <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark> - pass- again, tartness too overwhelming \n\n7. then we ordered some basic filler items- tempura, sushi (ca rolls and ama ebi)- all which were fine. \n\n8. we ordered the <mark>Bento Box</mark> dessert- it was ok- not fantastic. \n\noverall- the meal was great. the <mark>Black Cod Miso</mark> cod was so good- it had the right blend of sweetness with saltiness, and the fish was so tender it literally melts in your mouth. the chilean sea bass had the same texture and effect, but it costs about twice the amount as the black cod (a tidbit for those of you who are watching the $$s). \n\nwe had starved ourselves earlier in the day and were totally stuffed by the end of the meal. the whole meal with tip was just over $300. i highly recommend this place. it was the only restaurant that we went to in the older part of vegas that was great.", 
            "in case people don't know, nobu is the restaurant chain of a chef, nobu matsuhisa who has starred on that food channel show, \"iron chef.\" he has brought the gourmet \"new japanese\" cuisine to the world. this place is very expensive...but the taste is extraordinary. the black cod <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark> melts in your mouth. every dish is a work of culinary art. the service at the las vegas restaurant is excellent. they constantly make sure everything is clean, and ready, glasses filled, and your needs are met. the bill for 6 of us was $270 before tip, so this is costly, but not too over-priced. it is definitely an upper echelon restaurant. the las vegas venue is situated in the middle of the hard rock hotel and is therefore several decibels too high. if you eat there frequently you are going to lose your hearing. that is why i give it 4 stars. i can imagine this restaurant outside of the hard rock hotel will be more pleasant. if you're in your 20-40's you'll probably give it 5 stars.", 
            "i was in vegas for my birthday and my friends and i went here for my birthday meal. everything was delicious! my favorites were the yellow tail <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> and the black cod <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark> sauce. amazing! our waiter wasn't very friendly but the food made up for it. i will definitely go again!", 
            "food was stellar. the black cod lettuce <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark> may have perhaps been the single best food item i have ever eaten. it had sweet, spicy, cold, hot, crunchy, soft all in one bite. amazing. sadly, the two beef items we ordered medium rare came out closer to medium well. inexcusable at these prices. the final dish we ordered took over 40 minutes and service took a nose dive after first few courses. again, this is inexcusable to spend $800 for five people and not get stellar service.", 
            "all i have to say is.....\nblack cod with dried miso lettuce wraps =ftw!\n\nmy family decided to go a bit fancy and tried nobu at the hardrock in las vegas and i have to say, \"wow!\"  the food is amazing!  \n\ni have learned that at places like these, you know you are going to spend money.  so, why not eat the \"speciality\" things they are known for rather than food you can always get at another restaurant.  so, i ordered the yellow tail <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark>, the salmon tataki with cilantro dressing, <mark><mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark></mark>, and my favorite thing in the whole wide world= the black cod <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark> lettuce wraps!  \n\nomg!  this fish was amazing.  i didn't want to stop eating the lettuce wrap and never wanted it to end!  \n(i know it sounds very sexual but once you have this dish, you too will feel like you had a sexual encounter in your mouth!  -that's what she said!)\n\ni say if you ever have that one night when you want to go fancy while your in vegas and don't mind spending the money and want a very delicious experience, you need to go to nobu at the hardrock!  \n\nonce again let me say this again!  \nyou have to try the black cod with dried miso lettuce wraps!", 
            "i had high expectation coming in and left feeling somewhat unsatisfied.  while i do think nobu is a great sushi place to experience, it's a bit over hyped and is priced accordingly..\n\nthe place was not well lid so we opted for the sushi bar where we could actually see the food.  our sushi chef was cool, attentive, and a superb artisan.  i ordered the omakase ($100) and was pretty happy with the variety of dishes:\n1) toro <mark>Yellowtail or Salmon <mark>Blue Fin <mark>Toro Tartare</mark> with Royal Ossetra Caviar</mark></mark> - this was the highlight dish .. fabulous!\n2) 4 different sashimi dishes - <mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark>, yellowtail and a few others .. exotic varieties, beautifully presented, but a bit overpowered by the sauces .. i left nobu with a very strong ponzu aftertaste\n3) black cod .. good but sooooo overrated.  the sauce was just too strong for this delicate fish.  \n4) tenderloin with shitake and enoki mushrooms - i really regret asking to have this well done.  doh!\n5) 5 different pieces of sushi - ameabi, grilled eel, and a few others .. all were pretty good.\n\nthe waiting service was lacking for a fine dining establishment.  i found that the best waiting services are those that are not very visible but are attentive and will serve your needs before being asked.  nobu's staff, while very nice, was more of the opposite.  you see lots of guys crowding the restaurant but still have to ask and wait for stuffs.  the predominately male wait staffs also makes me wonder how tough it must be to compete for female employees with the local cabarets.\n\nbottom line:  i'm glad i tried nobu.  but, it'll be a long while before i come back especially when there are so many other options there in vegas.", 
            "it was saturday night in vegas, we wanted sushi, and nobu didnt even cross my mind until my boyfriend made reservations for the same night. i quickly logged on to yelp to check the latest reviews as i do with any restaurant, and i am happy to say that i am ecstatic i did this, because had i not, i would have missed out on the black cod <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark>.... which is without a doubt, one the best things that i have ever tasted. \n\nmy bf and i shared 4 dishes and 1 dessert, washed it down with 2 sapporo's each, and by the time we were done, we could barely walk!\n\n<mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> - delicious!!!! the sauce may be just a bit overpowering but delicious nonetheless. i couldnt even taste the jalapeno :)\n\n<mark><mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark></mark> - i have no clue why they are calling this \"ceviche\" but i wish we would have ordered something else instead. it was merely ok,  it just kind of tasted like cold <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> lettuce - but hey, i love <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark>  its all good :)\n\nblack cod <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark> - omg - i just got goosebumps thinking about this dish. it is hands down the best thing i have ever put in my mouth. i like how crunchy <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> it is..  delicioso~\n\n<mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark> roll - your basic roll ..  \n\n<mark>Bento Box</mark> dessert ( flourless chocolate cake with green tea <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark>) yum yum yum yum - this is a great combination - not too much,  shared <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> special is a perfect way to satisfy your sweet tooth.\n\nwill definitely come back - loved the all male service - everyone was really nice and our waiter pretty much gave us his thoughts on all the menu items and gave us some nice suggestions - that in hindsight, i should have taken.\n\n but hey, theyre's always next time!!", 
            "the visit was on a labor day sunday around 6pm.  the last visit to this particular nobu was back in 2003 when i didn't know the difference between a piece of foie and a rubber sole.  i recall having the chef special back then as well, but the omakase this time was definitely more enjoyable.  this was probably due to the fact that i wasn't three sheets to the wind this time.  being married does these things.\n\nthere were those that chose the bronze omakase ($100) and those that went for the silver ($150) like yours truly, and boy was there ever a difference.  there were major discrepancies between the cuts and also the types of meats served.  the sashimi and the speciality dishes also had noticeable differences.  it's not to say that the 100 dollar omakase wasn't good, but it wasn't great...at least from my vantage point.\n\nthere's about a zillion details i will be leaving out, such as the dried flakes of hoo-haa sprinkled with a drizzle of the thinger thang.  so use your imagination..\n\ncourse 1 - a bonito sashimi.\ncourse 2 - amaebi splashed with hot oil, chawan mushi with truffle and crab eggs at the bottom, kampachi sashimi with dried miso flakes.\ncourse 3 - toro sashimi <mark>King Crab with Amazu Ponzu</mark> ginger sauce <mark>Yellowtail and Jalapeno</mark> sauce topped with a bunch of edible flowers which made it all purdy and crap.\ncourse 4 - seared <mark>Scallop</mark> on a bed of sea beans.\ncourse 5 - kobe beef (served medium) with pan fried <mark>Teppan Style Foie Gras</mark>.\ncourse 6 - sushi set (nigiri) <mark>Inaniwa Pasta with Lobster</mark> broth and <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark>.  the set consisted of - toro, abalone, spanish mackerel, eel, tai (<mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark>) and tamago.\ncourse 7 - an array of sweets including <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark>, chocolate looking souffle thing, fresh fruits and other sugary confections we couldn't stay for because we were already late for the friggin cirque du pouffay show.\n\n..\n\nall in all, a great meal.  i enjoyed the silver omakase at matsuhisa better, the wife liked this dinner much better.  definitely a strong 4 star, but nowhere near a five.  the highlight of the meal for me was the foie served over the kobe.  the dish was so luxurious i really was at a loss for words as i was enjoying every delectable bite.  the slice of black truffle in the chawan mushi gives you a big mule kick in the face which was in short, heavenly.  \n\ni was surprised to find that i liked the non sushi dishes better than the raw, but is it such a huge surprise?  we live in cities like la, sf, ny, etc. where quality ingredients are so readily available.  i've had sashimi as good if not better in other restaurants.  most don't serve it with the detail and ingenuity like mr. nobu matsuhisa, but it takes way too much money to surprise this sushi cowboy.\n\ni truly don't mean to sound snobbish, but there's only so many ways to serve up a nice slab of toro.  i'm more impressed these days by the way chefs serve up foie.  and i am totally infatuated with bone marrow.\n\n..\n\ni've said too much.  \n\ni am off to eat.\n\nedit:\n\ni don't know if it was because we were in vegas, but i felt like everything was a bit contrived.\n\n*shrugs*", 
            "aaaahh... what can i say. nobu is awesome. service was great as well. we ate several years ago at nobu atlantis and had a bad experience however decided to give nobu vegas a chance- boy are we glad that we did. had the yellowtail  and <mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> sashimis - so yummy. for hot dishes had the black cod <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark> and <mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> again. so delicious. weren't that hungry since we had a late lunch at the pink taco also in hrh (which was not good food) so we were full after 2 cold and 2 hot and had to pass on the rolls which looked great.", 
            "if it were only about the sushi, nobu would get 5 stars from me. but, i knock off 2 stars for service. we walked in on a saturday night and got seats at the sushi bar, which is the place to be. we went with our sushi chef's suggestions, which were nobu's <mark>House Special</mark>, including \"new-style sashimi.\" these consist of the best fish, <mark>White Fish <mark>Scallop <mark>Salmon <mark>Oyster <mark>Beef <mark>Yuba Sashimi New Style</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark>, with delicate sauces and garnishes: <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark>, live octopus with a peruvian chili paste, whitefish and salmon <mark>King Crab with Amazu Ponzu</mark> sauce, tuna <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark>-mustard sauce. everything was first-class, including the junmai daiginjo sake.\n\nthen, i ordered the <mark>Bento Box</mark> chocolate cake dessert. we were told it would take 8 minutes to cook. no problem - our bellies were happily full of sashimi. 20 minutes later, however, still no dessert, and we finally were able to flag someone down to check on it. another ten minutes went by. our waiter then came out to tell us there was a mixup in the kitchen and our cake went to another table. he tried to give us a plateful <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark> to tide us over - this didn't go over well, as the last thing we wanted was to eat a plateful <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark> and then a chocolate cake. another ten minutes or so, the dessert came out. it was excellent, but frankly wasn't worth waiting over half an hour for. we ask ed for the check while still eating...took another ten minutes...gave the credit card and another ten minutes went by...waiter came out to tell us the credit card isn't clearing and do we want to give another card? by this point, well over an hour had gone by since dessert was ordered and we just wanted to leave already. \n\nwhen our check finally arrived, they did charge us for the dessert that took over 30 minutes to arrive at our table. when i mentioned this to the server, he took it right off the bill. but i was miffed that i even had to ask - the right thing to do would have been to take it off in the first place.\n\ntoo bad, since up until we ordered dessert we were very pleased with the sushi our wonderful chef served us. even for a saturday night in vegas, the service was unacceptably unresponsive for such a high-end restaurant.",

            "skip nobu if you've been to any other location. the atmosphere was very la and kind of snobby. it's a place to see and be seen and sadly this is applicable to the food as well. the menu was confusing and it almost felt like this was done on purpose in order to force the diner to chose the chef's tasting menu. we decided against it (at $100+ per person, we felt we could do better). we chose the <mark><mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark></mark>, <mark>Nobu Crispy Rice with Big Eye Tuna</mark> tempura roll and the <mark>Lobster <mark>Tuna <mark>King Crab <mark>Vegetable <mark>Salmon Nobu Style Taco</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark> to start. the tacos were insanely delicious and everything hit the mark quite well. these composed the \"cold\" dishes that nobu offers and then we moved on to the hot dishes which included kobe beef tataki style, black cod <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark> as well as some sashimi. the kobe beef was incredible and literally melted in our moths and it's no wonder the cod is a famous dish - it was delicious. looking at the menu now i'm uncertain as to why we felt the way we did, but i remember being less than enthused about dropping a few hundred dollars and not feeling like i got real value from our money. the atmosphere was cold and had it been a little friendlier perhaps we would have felt differently. the food felt like a celebrity chef was overseeing it, but you could tell this restaurant was a chain given how gimmicky everything was. sad because there's such a brand behind this name and they're just not living up to it.",

            "my buddy and i went to nobu this past friday night at 9:30 for their omasake chef choice tasting menu. we had very few disappointments. they sat us right away at the bar, tables would have been 15 minutes even with our reservations.  lots of good energy in the restaurant, lots of japanese yelling back and forth from the waiters and sushi chefs.  we split a $50 bottle of nonfiltered very fragrant nigori sake cold which was smooth and easy to drink. the small bits of rice at the bottle of the bottle reminded me of red wine sediment as a good thing. \n\nthe first course came out quick and cold. a chilled patty of toro tartar in a soy wasabi sauce topped <mark>Yellowtail or Salmon <mark>Blue Fin <mark>Toro Tartare</mark> with Royal Ossetra Caviar</mark></mark>, served with a baby silver spoon.  it was tender, smooth, rich and melt in your mouth.  the caviar was not memorable.  an a+ start and an expensive dish on their regular menu. next was 4 pieces per plate of thin cut fresh octopus topped with a cilantro leaf, a dot of super hot sauce, finished with citrus, like ceviche.  pretty good.  next was another cold appetizer of rice paper wrapped greens with a piece of raw ebi sweet shrimp, dressed with a fantastic sesame ginger sauce with a fried prawn head on the side.  my buddy especially liked the tempura batter on the <mark>Sweet Shrimp with Fried Head</mark> and the dressing.  i will personally come to your house and kill you if you do not eat the fried prawn head. \n\nthen started the hot plates.  first was the ever famous <mark>Black Cod Miso</mark> cod, a bit too sweet for my buddy but it did not keep us from both licking the plates.  a small piece of tender fish which just went on and on and kept melting in our mouths.  flavor of fish hard to come through past miso and sweetness.  like fish candy in a good way.  my friend said that an improvement would be to torch and crisp up the skin before putting on the sauce which would give some texture contrast and make the dish over the top.  $23 on the regular menu.  next was the beef tenderloin toban yaki style with a shitake and enokitake mushrooms and a piece of thin asparagus in a soy broth. beef very lean, not as melt in your mouth as i would like.  my buddy would have liked a nice piece of ribeye cap instead but who wouldn't.  the dish is served spitting hot on a mini hot plate and when they raise the cover in front of you, the steam envelopes you warmly.  try not to get the grease on you. \n\nnext was the nigiri sushi course of 5 pieces along with a nice clam <mark><mark>Lobster <mark>Miso Soup</mark></mark></mark>. we got a piece of <mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> (mmmm), magura tuna (so tender), yellowtail (yum), clam (a bit tough) and <mark>Sea Eel</mark> which was the most tender fall apart <mark>Sea Eel</mark> i have ever tasted.  the sushi rice <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> fill you to the gills by that point and then they hit you with the dessert which was a bento presentation of a warm flowerless chocolate lava cake with lots of lava and very little cake and a very good not sweet green tea <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark>.   this just put the nail in the coffin.  we were stuffed, but we couldn't stop eating since it was so good.  \n\nthe restaurant closed at 11pm on a friday night, but we will remember the meal for a long time coming.  next time i'm in vegas i plan to make it a point to return and see what the chef choice is at that point in time.  this was the $100 omasake.  the $150 would have <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> some kobe beef and <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> and there.  we were very happy with our choice.  i think the meal was an absolute bargain for the price.",

            "went i went to this particular nobu four years ago, it was outstanding. perfection on all front. really some of the best food and service i've ever had. since then, i'm not quite sure if my palate has become more discerning and/or nobu has lost just a little of it's shine. either way, it was still a great meal overall. \n\nhubs and i made a reservation here for my birthday dinner while in vegas. we put a note in the reservation stating so and while it's not a huge deal, we didn't hear happy birthday from our host, server or receive any sort of birthday love. our server was just fine, although he didn't seem to be the happiest of lads. maybe he was having a rough night. regardless, we went on an ordering spree and here's what we snacked on...\n\njalape\\u00f1o hamachi: 5/5: bright, flavorful and incredibly fresh. exactly what i remember about nobu! \n\nehu: 4/5: per the server a new-ish item on the mean, ehu is a short tail <mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark>. i've yet to taste ehu before, but it's a flaky white fish. taste overall was a bit overworked with multiple elements on the plate, but it was tasty. \n\nrock shrimp: 3/5: last time i was at nobu, hubs and i ordered two servings of this. not heart healthy but it used to be creamy and delicious with the shrimp perfectly flash fried. this go around it was clumpier, sticker and not quite as creamy. \n\nblack cod: 3/5: another dish that i used to love. this visit the cod was watery and lacked the complex flavor the miso previously provided. \n\nspicy <mark>Big Eye Tuna Roll</mark>: 4/5: standard <mark>Spicy Tuna (Big Eye)</mark>. fresh, delicious and on the mark. \n\nthis visit was a good one but not a great one overall. i'm still a fan of the ambiance and the creative menu items so here's hoping i came on an off-ish night!", 
            "when i criticized morimoto napa for being like a \"vegas restaurant,\" i now realize i was astral-projecting into the future and referring to this one.  chef nobu has a signature, peruvian-influenced style, and it seems to be coupling proper technique and great ingredients with a bunch of overpowering and discordant flavors.\n\nuni tempura is amazingly good, although the price ($16 for one piece) and the questionable accompaniments (the obligatory deep-fried shiso leaf) put it far down the value-for-money l<mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark>.\n\nthe tataki plates of kobe-\"style\" beef are great and totally worth the price.  they're an especially great maneuver for large parties, since the steak is so thinly sliced it's easily shared.\n\nking crab tempura is nicely made but there's way too much acid from the ponzu.\n\nthe same goes for the <mark><mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> Salad</mark>; it's far too acidic, the flavor of the <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> lost.  but the pasta aspect was nice; great texture.\n\nthe black cod <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark> is probably a reverse of the chef's intentions:  it's really miso with black cod.  miso is a tricky ingredient; in this dish it's just completely overpowering; it seems like approach is to simply rub the miso on directly.  that's a risky tactic and it doesn't really pay off; it was hard to get through more than a few bites.  and i *love* miso.\n\nmaki in its various forms are served with -- incredibly -- a side of ponzu sauce.  that's a first for me.  i'm not sure i get the logic behind it.  the special house rolls e.g. with jalape\\u00f1o are tasty enough, but generally the <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> flavors don't complement the fish very well.\n\nthe sushi itself is perfectly made.  the knife work <mark><mark>XO and Jamon Iberico</mark> <mark>Beef <mark>Crab Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> preparation and rolling are impeccable.\n\nnobu is a bit flashy and it's to be expected from a restaurant chain that's co-owned by a celebrity chef and an actual movie star.  it's also to be expected from las vegas.  \n\ni'd certainly recommend nobu for the more traditional fare:  it's essentially authentic and very well-made.  i don't think i'd recommend much beyond that.  japanese cuisine, being one of the greatest in the world, doesn't need fixing or innovation.  nor does it need an <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> side of ponzu sauce.",

            "so obviously if you are going here you know what to expect. we had a great experience. our server was one of the ones who went to open dubai, so we were well taken care of. he did warn us because of our reservation time (10:15p) and kitchen closing (11p), that he was unsure how they would send out what we ordered. so we were prepared. of course, if you are spending nobu money my feeling is the chefs serve until you are done. but that is the only reason for the 4th star, well and another completely over priced wine list. \n\ni have been to nobu next door in nyc, so this was a different experience.\n\nonto the food; we jumped all over the menu but stayed away from the sashimi because that seemed over priced f<mark>Premium Sushi or Sashimi</mark>. we ended up with a few hand rolls that were great because the nori was crispy (which seems tough for other places to pull off). \n\nfrom there we also had the <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark>, as always. then we had the <mark><mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark></mark>, and a couple <mark>Lobster <mark>Tuna <mark>King Crab <mark>Vegetable <mark>Salmon Nobu Style Taco</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark> as well. both good and the <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> great.\n\nmake sure you get the black cod <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark> in lettuce. awesome! just eat it straight away because it comes warm.\n\nif you haven't been, go!",

            "i was skeptical, but nobu delivered. i just finished dinner with a friend of mine and i had to write a review before i forgot the details. let's just get to the chase.\n\nmy friend and i walked in and i asked our server what the best three dishes were. he then recommend these three. i felt like a stuck up food critic requesting the chef hit me with his best shot. but i often do this for restaurants that i've never been to. after dinner, i find myself recommending the same. here's the pro and cons:\n\n1) toro carpaccio- okay, $70 for six pieces of fish can be a little on the steep side, but hey, i had to know what it was about. now i know and here's the scoop. the toro is incredibly delicious. it is amazingly tender, quite possibly the most tender toro i've ever had. the fish alone is a star, but the flavor profile that the chefs prepare is pretty impressive too. capers, truffle shavings, truffle oil <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> dressing over greens really hit the mark. i will say that there was a little too much soy sauce for my taste (that's right, i'm chinese and i'm saying it). i would request they served the sauce on the side, but fear they will substitute excess soy sauce with hate.\n\n2)<mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark>- this was almost my favorite dish of the night had it not been for the sheer flavor of the toro. the yellowtail is served as one would expect from an expensive sushi restaurant: fresh, flavorful, tender and seasoned according. the jalapeno slice was perfect- excellent spice without burning my mouth. i would actually recommend this as a first dish. \n\n3) <mark>Black Cod Miso</mark>- i thought this was a little overrated by the other reviews. cooked to near perfection, the cod was warm inside but seared and slightly crispy outside. the miso glaze wasn't much to look at. for me, it resembled gravy. i've seen others' pictures and theirs looks much nicer. nevertheless, the dish was great. i actually prefer black cod cooked slightly medium, but cooked to the core with awesome texture. sweet miso sauce finished off the dish and made it very enjoyable. \n\n4)<mark>Sea Urchin</mark> sashimi or sushi!!! just order it. \n\nmy friend and i were pretty hungry and ordered other dishes but i must say that they didn't exactly knock me off my feet. overall, many of the other dishes were very good, but just not amazing. here's the list:\n\n-<mark>Salmon Skin</mark> hand roll- thin slices of <mark>Salmon Skin</mark> with gobo, rice and seasoning. nice to have a place serve quality over quantity when it comes to the <mark>Salmon Skin</mark>.\n\n-baracuda <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark>- $40 for six slices of barracuda. very interesting texture as i haven't had barracuda before. the lemon/citrus sauce was a bit too much. again, i see this as how the chef intends the dish to be enjoyed, so i simply eat and keep my comments to myself. \n\nlive scallop- again, great cut of <mark>Scallop</mark>, but nothing special to write home about. it was nice that it was served with muscle in ponzu sauce. \n\n<mark>White Fish <mark>Scallop <mark>Salmon <mark>Oyster <mark>Beef <mark>Yuba Sashimi New Style</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark> oyster- four pieces of kumamoto oysters served ready to enjoy. so you have to eat it the way they prepare the seasoning.\n\ncrispy rice w/ <mark>Nobu Crispy Rice with Big Eye Tuna</mark>- for lack of a better term, it's japanese tatter tots. square rice cubes deep fried served with essentially tuna poke. well prepared, tasty, but nothing special. \n\nall in all, it was a great experience. my general assessment is that nobu serves dishes with strong flavor profiles. not exactly my cup of tea. maybe i'm a fond believer that less is more and that the fish should speak for itself. however, i can appreciate the fact that a chef's dish is his own art. so i eat with an open mind and share my interpretation. hope this helps.", 
            "nobu should <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> letters to the end of its name: e-n-o.  \n\nthe food here tastes better than mcdonald's but worse than chipotle, but i would rate mcdonald's higher due to it being a better value.  we had the tasting menu <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> sushi.  the <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark>, along with every other cold dish, followed the same formula: raw fish + cilantro hidden underneath a pile of salt. the black cod <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark> and the beef tenderloin tasted like bad halloween candy.  everything was either drenched in salt or drenched in sugar, or both.  the sushi was not inedible, it was on par with the kind of sushi you can get from any two-dollar-sign sushi restaurant.  it's pretty hard to mess up sushi to the extent that they messed up their other dishes, since chefs have less artistic license when it comes to sushi.  then again, it's hard to mess up <mark><mark>Lobster <mark>Miso Soup</mark></mark></mark> and theirs was the worst i've ever had (way too salty).  service was good.  \n\nour bill, including tip, came out to nearly $600 for three people.  so if you want to trick your non-asian friends into believing that their palates lack the sophistication to appreciate expensive asian cuisine, nobu is the place to go.  or sometimes when you're feeling masochistic, you just want to get punched in the face.  that's when you go to nobu.  \n\nthere are many reasons to go to nobu, but edible food is not among them.  if you want good food, there are some great french options in the area, such as le cirque.",

            "we planned to have dinner with our friends who live in vegas on one night of our two night stay there recently. after scouring the restaurant recommendations from my friend, we decided on nobu. sometimes i have to be in the mood for sushi, i don't always crave it like other people i know, so i was worrying about committing to a reservation. i was also worried about having to pay a million dollars (slight exageration; i don't even have a million dollars, and if i did, i would only spend half on wine) for any good wine. (true story, i made the mistake of ordering a glass of wine at the bar in the casino at the flamingo (don't ask) one night and it had me wishing for manischewitz.)\n\nok - back to the matter at hand: nobu has now made me crave sashimi, sushi and all japanese food all the time. not only did the server rattle off, in detail, and totally and completely from her memory, just about every item listed on the menu, but the food was amazing. i die. we had a smattering of everything from each \"category\" and honestly, went a bit overboard, but it was a meal well worth going over board on. \n\nwe dined on:\n\n-edamame\n-<mark><mark>Lobster <mark>Miso Soup</mark></mark></mark>\n-tempura fried rock shrimp <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> type of delicious citrusy, creamy sauce\n-<mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> (out of this world)\n-red <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark> (also, amazing)\n-salmon <mark>White Fish <mark>Scallop <mark>Salmon <mark>Oyster <mark>Beef <mark>Yuba Sashimi New Style</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark> sashimi, which was lightly seared and served with green onion, absolutely delicious\n-<mark>Soft Shell Crab</mark> roll\n-spicy <mark>Big Eye Tuna Roll</mark> (cause, come on, you gotta round out the meal)\n\nthe dessert was good but unremarkable. i'm more about the main event.\n\ncap that <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> amazing gin cocktail that i now forget the name of and two glasses of hellaciously expensive, but delicious, sauvignon blanc, and this is one of the top meals i have had in my little life thus far... \n\nin short, take your gambling winnings to nobu and order everything the server suggests.", 
            "yesterday, my boyfriend and i dropped in for a late night bite. definitely a fan of the decor and the service. our waitress, misty (name on receipt) was thorough and helpful, taking time to answer all questions and providing suggestions. the rest of the evening staff was equally as attentive and descriptive. awesome team. \n\nnow, food. personally, skip the taco apps, nothing special to note there. the rock shrimp had a bit too much sauce for even that type of dish. do go for the chilean sea bass <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark>. it's perfectly cooked in a buttery-citrusy sauce bed; the <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark> on top <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> texture and will make your mouth water. a dish that is both simple yet complex on its own. also, the <mark>Uni or Oyster Shooter</mark> was absolutely delish, with the right balance of sauce and meat. i had a spicy acai cocktail which was one of the best cocktails i've had in a while!! yum. i was too tired to remember what else we had. wish we came earlier to try the rest of the menu.", 
            "so- we utilized a tasting menu purchase from groupon, and my biggest fear was that it was not going to be enough food...far from it! the dishes are all good-sized portions (frankly, more food than myself and my boyfriend would normally eat) and everything was delicious! some, more than others- the actual sushi roll was a little forgettable, but the following were amazing: yellowtail sashimi with jalape\\u00f1o, rock <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark> with creamy spicy sauce, black cod <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark>. also, the desert was delicious. \n\ni would recommend, however pricing is not for the faint of heart. it is pricey- but, i think anyone attending this establishment should know that.", 
            "i loved my food here! please see pics of my appetizer and dessert.\nthe service was wonderful from beginning to end. i had salmon wrapped pear as an appetizer. it was sprinkled with olive oil. very fresh, light and refreshing!\nto drink...a lychee martini. it was good\nfor my main course, i ordered the black cod <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark> sauce. it was scrumptious! it was flaky and flavorful. i would order this again.\ni just couldn't go to a japanese restaurant and not get sushi...so i order yellowtail with jalape\\u00f1o. it was the right amount of spicy.\ndessert...flourless chocolate cake...side of house made green tea <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark> garnished with blueberries and raspberries. phenomenal!\nmy only complaint is that it was extremely pricey. but i would still return!", 
            "nobu must be my favorite restaurant in vegas.  could it be my favorite anywhere?\n\ni brought a co-worker with me who loves japanese food.  after dinner, he said to me, \"where i grew up, we were taught not to make a religion out of food.  but, after this dinner, i may become a true believer.\"  \n\ndon't think of nobu as a typical japanese restaurant -- even though you can order sushi and sashimi.  think of it as a clever japanese inspired restaurant that takes familiar flavors and brings them to the next level.\n\nfor example, the yellowtail came as very thin, delicate slices <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> and cilantro, instead of wasabi.  the black cod <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark> is sublime.  when i asked for a second order, the waitress suggested the cod with pate in lettuce cups.  that was sublime.", 
            "i had wanted to try nobu for some time, having heard many good things about it. when i saw the $99 groupon plus the 20% off groupon was offering plus my wife's b'day to celebrate there, i knew the stars were aligned.  could it live up to reputation?\nthe food: the groupon is for a 5 course tasting menu. the meal starts with a pass out of edamame with maldon salt. a very generous portion and an excellent way to start a meal. the first course was yellowtail tuna <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> and cilantro. the tuna was sliced super thin and was in a citrus sauce. it was very tasty and different than yellowtail that i have eaten at my local sushi restaurant. things got even better after that. the next dish was rock <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark> with a creamy spicy sauce. wow, was that good! not like any tempura i have eaten before. very lightly breaded, cooked so the shrimp were soft but not mushy. and the spicy sauce was easily handled even by my gringo palate. a great dish. and a huge portion. by its size, the dish would have been enough for dinner if it was the only thing served. this was followed by the alaskan black cod <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark>. another outstanding dish. the fourth course was the sushi; tuna, fluke and salmon with a california roll. this was the weakest part of the menu - only very good. last course, dessert. i photographed the plate. a beautiful presentation with very tasty treats (and a hand written birthday greeting in chocolate). the food rates 5 stars plus.\nthe service: as soon as we were seated, our server, albert, came by to greet us, explain the tasting menu, and take our drink orders. throughout the meal, he, the busboy, and the food runner were very attentive without being overbearing. they made us feel very welcome. our water glasses were never allowed to go below half full. the table was cleared promptly. the food came out of the kitchen plated beautifully. the service was 5 stars plus.\nthe ambiance: the restaurant is nicely decorated with lots of bamboo. however, the tables for 2 were placed one on top of the other. we were there on a monday night, so the tables were never more than 1/3 full.  but our table was about 6 inches from the next table, which was 6 inches from the next in a line up of 4 tables. if the restaurant were crowded and there were people at the next table, we would have been eating with strangers. not my idea of a celebration/romantic meal. at best, 3 stars for ambiance.\nvalue: $80 for dinner of this quality is the deal of the decade. i would do it again in a heartbeat. but i would never go on a weekend night when the table next to me might be occupied (or i would go with a party of 6 or more - the bigger tables were nicely spaced out).", 
            "i have always wanted to try nobu and finally went! and it was worth the wait let me tell you! we went for my bday and did not have a reservation. we got there pretty early around 5ish so they were able to sit us without a res. our waiter jeffrey was on point. best service. he recommended we start with the <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark>. it was melt in my mouth amazing. i could live off the dish for the rest of my life. lol. it was yellowtail with the right amount of sweetness and spice. we also got the cucumber salad which was pretty good. a lot of the vinegar did go to the bottom of the bowl which made it hard to coat your salad but it was still good. we also had a sear salmon sashimi which i do not remember the name that was excellent. we got spicy edamame, <mark>Beef Kushiyaki</mark>, the black cod <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark> and the wagyu beef gyoza. the cod was really good and highly recommended. the wagyu beef was great with two dipping sauces. we literally could have kept ordering food. we had a couple of nice cocktails as well. \n\nafter dinner they brought us out a plate with happy birthday with a choc cake and green <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark>. we also ordered the whiskey moose. both <mark>Dessert</mark> were to die for and i was in heaven. \n\nwhat a fun place to go. you have people dressed to the max, casual people, people from all over the world that come and eat here. come chow down some amazing eats, listen to some funky music and watch the beautiful people. yes please!"

            "nobu would have gotten the 5th star, except for the loud music, and the decidedly non-intimate seating. my wife and i aren't opposed to answering a question about a dish, but when the folks next to you can lean over and check out what you're eating, well...i understand that that's the place's image, but it just keeps it from being a 5-star dining experience, imo.\n\nwe went on a sunday night at 7:30p. we were seated immediately, and our server brought the drink menus. my wife had the passion mojito, and i stuck with a sapporo because i'm not a huge fan of sake. the drink menu was replaced with the dinner menu, but we were pretty sure we were going to have the omakase.\n\nthere are two basic \"levels\" of omakase...each is composed of a mixture of cold dishes, hot dishes, sushi, and dessert. the lower-priced version ($100) contains more traditional dishes, and the higher priced version ($135) was said to be more \"exotic\". we both opted for the latter. i was trying to listen to the explanation of each dish and then scribble them down, so i likely missed some of the little accompaniments/garnishes. \n\n- kumamoto oyster, on the half-shell, with nobu salsa\n- sweet shrimp (sashimi-style, no rice, and no tempura head)\n- some kind of shellfish sashimi-style (either scallop or clam, i'm leaning towards scallop, based on the texture and the menu offerings)\nall three of these items were served on the same plate, the latter two with, i think, ponzu sauce. the oyster was pretty large, such that i didn't want to pick the shell up and end up wearing some of it. the sweet shrimp was very rich and quite tasty, and what i'm assuming was the scallop was a little firmer than i would expect, but still very good.\n\n- kampachi sashimi with kelp and mushroom \nkampachi is one of my favorite fish, and this did not disappoint. the kelp and mushroom, i think, were kept subtle so as not to overpower the fish...you could actually skip the kelp and mushrooms if you were trying to save room for later. \n\n- new-style unagi (lightly seared) layered with shiitake over a bed of tofu, with uni on the side\nthey have a really good sauce for the uni, because i don't like uni, and this tasted great! :) the unagi was also wonderful when prepared like this, as the meat is very tender, and no powerful marinade.\n\n- toro salad with vegetable spring roll\ni wasn't crazy about the spring roll...i thought it was bland. the toro salad, however, was very good.\n\n- green tea & ume sorbet\ni guess this was a palate cleanser? i wasn't expecting to get something like this in the middle of the meal. after the server brought it out, i told my wife, \"thank you for dining at nobu, please come back soon.\" anyway, it was not overly sweet, and would be fine as a dessert after a big meal.\n\n- broiled snapper over risotto with <mark>Snow Crab</mark> meat, topped with a white truffle chip \nthe hot dishes started with a small chunk of snapper that was done pretty much perfectly, no color, but still very juicy. the risotto was ok, nothing special, but the rice went well with the fish.\n\n- small, sliced, grilled \"kobe\" beef tenderloin with okinawa potatoes served alongside a slice of grilled japanese eggplant topped with a small piece of grilled <mark>Teppan Style Foie Gras</mark>.\ni'm going to commit heresy in a bit...i put kobe in quotes, because i hear a bunch of stories about whether or not kobe is kobe, but this tenderloin was done rare, and the potatoes went nicely with it. great dish. i don't really like eggplant, but this was ok, so they did something right. i'd never had <mark>Teppan Style Foie Gras</mark> before, and, well, meh? there, i said it.\n\n- <mark><mark>Lobster <mark>Miso Soup</mark></mark></mark> with clam\nanother break, like the sorbet. it wasn't bad or anything, but i was getting kinda full, so i almost skipped it. (almost).\n\n- nigiri sampler: oh toro, pink snapper, sardine, <mark>Snow Crab</mark>, <mark>Jumbo Clam</mark>\nthe clam was fresh and crunchy, but the <mark>Snow Crab</mark> was pretty ordinary. this was only the second time i've had sardine nigiri. i like sardine under other circumstances, but for sushi, i think it's just too oily? i couldn't tell the difference between the pink snapper and, say, fresh tai, but it was very firm and tasty. my wife told me the oh toro was awful and that i should consider letting her eat it for me, as she didn't want it to ruin my dinner. i love her very much, but in matters of sushi, she is not to be trusted. :) try the oh toro.\n\n- blancmange (yogurt, in this case) over almond crisp, pomegranate seeds, and assorted frozen berries.\nfull. i almost had to pass on dessert (almost). again, not overly sweet, which is a plus in my book, and the berries and almond crisp combined very well. \n\nthe service was tremendous, as the restaurant has a large waitstaff, so dishes are cleared away promptly, but we were not rushed. our section filled up towards the latter half of the meal, but the staff were able to keep up with no problems.\n\nif you're a fan of this type of japanese food, check it out - it's pricey, but you're in vegas, so live a little!"

            "when a restaurant has the nerve to charge exorbitant prices for food, i damn well better get the best taste and the best service in my entire life. you will not get either one at nobu. i came here the other night treating an unemployed friend for dinner, what a sham.\ni asked the sushi \"chef\" what is good that day and he recommended the king crab roll. we said ok and this little roll came out and the taste was simply ok. i was not impressed at all. i was actually quite annoyed. i ordered some uni and monkfish liver. now when i order monkfish liver at any other sushi spot, i either get 2 pieces of sushi or a few medallion sized sashimi. at nobu, i got one medallion-sized piece on a gigantic plate that was covered in this peach sauce. i was becoming rather bored and none of this tiny shit was fulfilling my appetite. i asked the chef what he has that's unusual and off the menu. he said the yellowtail or white tuna, you know, cuz no other sushi place has that! i told him something a little more unique and he just didn't know what to offer. finally he said live octopus. i ordered it and it just kinda arrived in front of me. i imagined it would've been prepared in front of me or shown to me before cutting it.. anything. i have no idea where it came from or how it looked. it was drenched in some sort of clear vinegar-like sauce with green stuff and all i tasted was this crap all over it. \ni got the bill and almost ran the hell out! it was $198. for that crap! we ordered 4 lychee martinis which were good, not worth $56 for 4 of them.  twenty five dollars for the crab roll! $25 for the <mark>Octopus</mark>! $15 for the uni. i payed in absolute anger and disgust, left a 20% tip and got the hell out of there. \nhonestly, i am a harsh critic, i admit that. however, i feel financially raped by this place and am losing sleep over it. the food was so not worth it. anyone who knows sushi really well wouldn't be caught in this lame over-priced trap. it should be illegal to serve crap sushi covered in taste bud-overdose sauce! i will never ever go near nobu again and will warn people waiting to not bother. \nhere's a big middle finger to nobu nationwide."

            "i agree with ming-jou in the fact that i was totally disappointed at this place. i should have also listened to my friend who went there and was really disappointed at their omakase, but being japanese, i wanted to try their food to see what the hype was about.  we had reservations at 9 pm and although we got there earlier, they didn't seat us till then.  it was shockingly a loud place that we often had to yell at each other to talk and even to order.  also, the crowd was much older than i anticipated.  the interior had a nice asian feel to it with bamboos everywhere, even on the ceilings.\n\nfor starters, we had edamame, yellowtail tartar <mark>Yellowtail or Salmon <mark>Blue Fin <mark>Toro Tartare</mark> with Royal Ossetra Caviar</mark></mark>, <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark>.  the menu was vague that we didn't expect any sauce with the tartar, but to our surprise, it came in a sauce with wasabi that was a little spicy.  i wish the menu would have included more details.  we got to order individual tempura items, which was a \"first\" for me.  we ordered shrimp, broccoli, and sweet potato.  the order came with 2 pieces each.  i liked how it came out really hot with light batter.  also, they were generous with their tempura sauce with daikon-oroshi (grated daikon).  most places give you barely enough sauce.  for dinner, we shared the <mark>Sushi Dinner</mark> which came with 8 nigiri and 6 pieces of tekka maki (<mark>Big Eye Tuna Roll</mark>).  the sushi rice tasted old as it was cold and flat, not warm and plump.  also, the rice portion for a nigiri was much more than it needed.  fish seemed fresh, but the rice was disappointing.  that ruined my dinner.\n\nwe decided to try their dessert since we don't usually order dessert at an asian restaurant.  we tried their miso almond cake which was the best part of my meal.  it came <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> caramel glaze and edamame <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark>.  the cake was yummier than i expected.  \n\noverall, it was not as good as i expected but i'm giving 3 stars for the good dessert and the great service."

            "nobu is easily my favorite place to dine in las vegas.  i've been told their traditional sashimi and nigiri offerings are fresh and tasty, but i wouldn't know, because nobu offers up so many unique south-american influenced japanese dishes that i only order from their special items.  i recommend you do the same; you didn't come to vegas to be boring and unadventurous, so why change now?\r\n\r\nthe star of the menu is the broiled black cod <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark>.  when you go, check with the waiter to see if this dish is available with the phyllo dough wrap; if it is, order it that way and prepare for the best thing to ever enter your mouth.  also great are fresh <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark>, <mark>White Fish <mark>Scallop <mark>Salmon <mark>Oyster <mark>Beef <mark>Yuba Sashimi New Style</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark> sashimi, and <mark><mark>Nobu's Moriawase Sashimi Salad</mark></mark> with matsuhisa dressing.  \r\n\r\nmy rating is 1 star shy of a perfect score only because eating there burns a serious hole in my wallet (this ain't todai after all); if only it were not as expensive, i could go more often to feast on the delicious food.", 
            "*** nobu - london ***\n\nawesome & expensive!!!  the servers explain everything about the dish they're serving to you.  again, this is for the nobu located in london, not las vegas.\n\nrecommedations: nobu's <mark>Black Cod Miso</mark> and <mark>Scallop</mark> kobujime",

            "more like 3 1/2 stars.  i've been to the ny and miami ones, and this is 2nd behind nyc.  good food and service for the most part.  \nfresh <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> - yum, though presentation was better at nyc\nrock <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark> <mark>King Crab with Amazu Ponzu</mark> and chili pepper - yum\n<mark>King Crab Ceviche</mark>- yum\n<mark>Creamy Spicy Crab</mark> - doubt this is authentic but if you love mayo like i do...yum\nwashu beef - served <mark>White Fish <mark>Scallop <mark>Salmon <mark>Oyster <mark>Beef <mark>Yuba Sashimi New Style</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark> - like a carpaccio drizzled with sesame oil - yum\n\nthis is where i would take points away:\n-the space is not that impressive for the prices\n-bathroom being way back out in the casino.  every food establishment should have a convenient place to wash your hands!\n-uni was so--- not fresh,  it was bitter!  though as soon as i mentioned it, the waiter took it off our bill.  i'm just surprised a place of this caliber would serve anything with poor quality.\n-though i expect the specials to be pricey, it would be courteous to mention to a party of two that one of them is $120!", 
            "i've heard various friends praise los angeles's nobu over the years, so after my girlfriend ran the las vegas marathon this weekend, we decided to celebrate <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> first-class sushi.\n\nwe had reservations at 9:00 pm, and we were seated promptly (actually ahead of time, which was nice). my first impression of the restaurant was that it was extremely loud (we were there on a tuesday night), and its location in the hard rock hotel made me groan (it's a bit out of the way, and not necessarily a place i want to poke around).\n\nour waiter, justin, was initially very prompt with our drink orders, but it took 10 minutes (and a reminder) to get glasses of water, and another 10 to get <mark><mark>Lobster <mark>Miso Soup</mark></mark></mark>.\n\nour first course was only half right (we got two dishes, but one was not what we ordered). the servers apologized and took it away. at the rate they were bringing out our food, though, we shuddered to think how long it would take them to bring out the correct dish. for<mark>Tuna (Big Eye)</mark>, it was corrected quickly.\n\nwhen our sushi came out, we noticed another mistake: the <mark>Spicy Miso Chips <mark>Nobu Crispy Rice with Big Eye Tuna</mark> or <mark>Scallop</mark></mark> had been mistakenly replaced with a second order of <mark>Spicy Tuna (Big Eye)</mark>. again, we told them it was wrong and again, they corrected the mistake rather quickly.\n\nservice got to be so bad that after asking a server to hail our waiter (and subsequently having the request ignored), we decided to get the manager over to our table. we were 30 seconds from getting up and leaving (she took another 5 minutes to get to the table) when she came over and heard our story. she seemed as interested in our plight as any manager should and agreed to comp some of our dishes, which was nice.\n\nstill, however, justin's service through the entire night was abysmal (i think we saw him 3 times over an hour and a half), and no amount of manager treatment could save the tip.\n\nregarding the food, it was ok. the <mark><mark>Lobster <mark>Miso Soup</mark></mark></mark> was great. the <mark>Spicy Tuna (Big Eye)</mark> and scallop rolls were anything but (very mild), and the hot/cold mixture of the tuna tempura rolls was a little strange. it was good, but the temperature difference was one of those things that made me wonder, \"is this supposed to be this way and i'm an idiot for thinking this, or is something actually wrong with how it was made?\" judging by the fact that the tuna tempura rolls were one of the dishes they got wrong initially, it could have been that they rushed the order and made it worse. either way, i wasn't really in love with it.\n\nfor the price i [would have] paid, i can't say that the las vegas nobu is really worth it for me again. i've had much better sushi in oakland, for much less.", 
            "this is a difficult review for me to write - i have regarded nobu matsuhisa as one of the most innovative chefs in japanese cuisine. maybe time is passing by and his '<mark>White Fish <mark>Scallop <mark>Salmon <mark>Oyster <mark>Beef <mark>Yuba Sashimi New Style</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark>' doesn't seem so 'new' anymore? \n\ni've had sushi at the london, dallas, and nyc locations of nobu in the past, as well as the excellent original matsuhisa restaurant in la. my visit to nobu in las vegas did not seem to compare with the others. it was great sushi, to be sure - fresh, quality cuts of fish with well-prepared 'cooked' dishes. the service during my visit was pretty indifferent (we sat at the sushi bar) and the chef we sat in front of only seemed to be going through the paces of preparing food at a restaurant that would be packed with hipsters regardless of the quality or preparation of the food. perhaps the global expansion of nobu has dulled this place - haven't seen a change on a nobu menu in years. sad.\n\nanyway, enough hatin'. i had a great <mark>Creamy Spicy Crab</mark> (excellent dish), lots of sushi - uni, konpachi, unagi, chyu-toro, kani - a portion of nobu's house sake (love the bamboo flasks there), tempura, and the exellent miso-marinated black cod. it was all good. but i'm not sure i'll seek out the lv branch of nobu in the future (it was located in our hotel in vegas). \n\ngiven nobu's prices with its growing 'chain' atmosphere and innovativeness of other places (morimoto, tyson cole's uchi), i can only give nobu-lv 3 stars.", 
            "just got back from nobu. i sat at the sushi bar and ended up a little tipsy-er than expected. even so, here is the review:\n\ntheir specialty dishes are really very good. i got both the toro & caviar dish and the live <mark>Scallop</mark>. yes. i really did pay $40 for the toro and caviar. was it worth it? at least once. all of their normal sushi stuff was fresh and good, but to be honest, there are a million other sushi places that offer fresh, raw fish for a lot cheaper. so my suggestion? if you are going to go there, make sure to try at least a couple of the specialty dishes.\n\ndecor seemed fine...i was more interested in the lightning hands with uber sharp knife sushi chef. he was not only super cool to watch, but also offered some superb suggestions, even though he clearly only understood a tiny bit of english. ultra attentive wait staff...maybe even a little too attentive, but i think that is because chairs are so close together at the sushi bar that you can't have more than 1 plate in front of you at a time. in other words, if you didn't have an ultra-attentive wait staff, you wouldn't be able to order more food.\n\nwhat keeps this place from 5 stars? price. wicked expensive. like super-wicked. i know you expect to pay a bunch for good sushi, but this is pretty high. drinks run $15, specialty items run $20-$40, and any other nigiri hangs at around $10. though, you should be scared when you notice the no price dillio on their website.i had a great meal for sure, but i don't know if it would be worth $130 again.\n\ni went alone, and didn't feel odd at all. i'd love to say that i'd be back, but the things that could hold me back are the price tag, and the lack of proximity to the strip. that being said, if you are getting some cost assistance (biznass trip), and are staying somewhere close (say...the alexis park hotel), then i'd go for sure.", 
            "i walk in this place and say \"please do not hand me a menu\". i know it like the back of my hand.  i have been here several times over many years and cannot get enough of the \"<mark>White Fish <mark>Scallop <mark>Salmon <mark>Oyster <mark>Beef <mark>Yuba Sashimi New Style</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark> sashimi\".  i get the white fish and salmon, delish!  very thin sliced fish served in a warmer than room temperature sesame oil sauce sprinkled with chives. now it's on to the yellow tail w/ jalapeno peppers.  melt in your mouth!  next is the popcorn shrimp, not too breaded, crunchy and that sauce...yum!  <mark>Chilean Seabass</mark> is next up- buttery, tender and the flavor is indescribable.  black cod w/ miso sauce- perhaps my favorite dish. it's done right!  and believe me, i make this at  home, it's hard to find a miso paste that has the right balance so not to over power the fish.  so yeah, this is an expensive place to dine but i am never disappointed.  i am not a big portion person, if you are, you'd hate it or go broke here. i love the quality, care and presentation of every dish here.  wine list is good and cocktails are imaginative.  service is always good here and if you don't take my word about the aforementioned menu options, the wait staff is happy to recommend and explain the dishes in great detail.", 
            "this was the first time ever i've dined with three other yelpers so i'm curious to see where the other reviews come in. personally, four stars is a little high but i really enjoyed three dishes and didn't dislike anything so i'll give it four, albeit unenthusiastically. (i don't think i've ever typed a longer word than \"unenthusiastically\").\n\nthe black cod <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark> was the highlight. the kobe beef was amazing too but we all misread the menu and when that showed up at $192 i'd call it hands down the most overpriced thing i've ever eaten. the <mark>Scallop</mark> topped <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> were the third great dish. the sushi was fine though nothing spectacular.\n\nthe ambiance is surprisingly boring, especially for vegas. it looks the way a japanese restaurant might if designed by the high-school drama department - all cheap bamboo reeds and sloppy wood structures. and the service, though efficient, was humorless. any waitress who can't understand the genius in asking if there are any beef-based <mark>Dessert</mark> off the menu is not winning any points with me.\n\nstill, the price minus the kobe was totally reasonable, especially for vegas. and the matsuhisa martinis go a long way toward <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> up to a pretty good meal.", 
            "our first stop during our trip to vegas this past week. we decided to come here to celebrate my aunties birthday! my cousin and i have heard so much about the place we had to try it with our mother's during our mother/daughter trip to vegas.  here is what we ordered\n\nyellowtail w/ jalapeno (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tcwmgoiv0pxqkwe1sybiwq?select=dwkr-lhpvr9kfivr4q7ptq: very delicious, my mother and cousin who do not eat sashimi even enjoyed the dish. after the dinner when i asked them what their favorite dish was this was on the top. it is slices of yellowtail sashimi w/ a type of ponzu sauce and good to eat with the small slice of jalapeno and cilantro. i think i've had similar dishes like this at other restaurants but i think b/c its from nobu it just makes it that much better. \n\n<mark><mark>Nobu's Moriawase Sashimi Salad</mark></mark> (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tcwmgoiv0pxqkwe1sybiwq?select=12qbnh80ncnjdby_mzvnog): the dressing on this salad was very good and tasty. it comes with mixed greens in the middle and like seared ahi layering the outside. i wish it had a couple of different types of sashimi in the salad but that's okay, it still tasted good. \n\n<mark>Scallop</mark> with filo on lettuce cups (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tcwmgoiv0pxqkwe1sybiwq?select=nk22wem6xycmo21jvgpjvq): this was probably my favorite dish. the scallop melted in your mouth and the taste was pretty good. i think the <mark>Scallop</mark> were made with a miso sauce and had green onions sprinkled on top. whatever it was it was super super good. ahhh drool.\n\nwhole deep fried cod or snapper i don't remember the name of the fish on top of sauteed veggies in a miso butter sauce (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tcwmgoiv0pxqkwe1sybiwq?select=vefn4poi2zsbdznyhzaaxq): this was another special. the waiter told us that everyone raves about this dish. it came out and we were all in awe. it was pretty big. the table was in wow when my mother and my auntie started laughing... they then asked one of the waiters how much it was $100.00.. wow, didn't realize that when we ordered it. i think it should have been something that the waiter said, especially since it cost so much.  needless to say the fish was delicious! you can eat almost every single piece of it. the fins where crunchy and were very good dipped in the miso butter sauce. the sauce was sweet with a little spicy. the sauteed veggies were also very good and eaten with the fish heavenly. we picked at this dish the whole dinner and still weren't able to eat the whole thing.  bummer b/c we definitely tried, we knew we had to get our moneys worth if we were going to spend $100 on one dish. \n\nsushi and the tempura dinner: nothing spectacular about either of these dishes. i don't even remember what rolls we got except for the house roll which wasn't anything special. i would definitely skip both if you are coming here. get these at some other restaurant. \n\nthe service was good but not spectacular. they have a lot of people working here but nobody went out of their way to enhance our experience. \n\noverall i would come here again. there are a couple other things i would like to try off their menu.", 
            "having owned nobu's cookbook for years, i was only too excited to finally visit a restaurant of his.  (which means my lazy ass never made anything form the cookbook but my excuse is that some of his ingredients are so hard to find....but i digress).\n\ndrinks:\njyunmai sake - \"masu\" size (wooden box cup) smooth and lovely to drink\nyk 35 - \"masu\" size.  this was the most expensive one on their list and boy was it worth every dollar.\nnote: masu is served in an overflowing box-cup on a plate.  you finish your cup and then pour what's on the plate back into your vessel.\n\nfood:\nmonkfish liver - honestly, not my thing.  i tried but just couldn't get over the fish-flavored paste.  it had caviar on top which i ate.  but my husband who loved it said the sweet miso sauce enhanced the whole thing greatly.  he enjoyed having the dish to himself.\ntiradito, nobu style - sashimi with a dab of hot chili sauce and black sea salt and cilantro.  one of my faves but not for hubby\n<mark>White Fish <mark>Scallop <mark>Salmon <mark>Oyster <mark>Beef <mark>Yuba Sashimi New Style</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark> sashimi - sashimi doused <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> sauce and oil, topped with ginger and green onions. also one of my faves but had to share this one with hubby. \nsweet shrimp <mark>White Fish <mark>Scallop <mark>Salmon <mark>Oyster <mark>Beef <mark>Yuba Sashimi New Style</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark> sashimi - even better than the above.  yum.  hubby let me have most of this one and for that, i'm forever grateful.\nuni tempura - this was the one thing i wanted to try the most.  the shiso wrapped around the uni gave it another facet and i greatly enjoyed this dish...on my own.  more for me!  the accompanying shitake mushroom and salts were delicious.\nmiso black cod - i didn't have high hopes but our server recommended it so we went with it.  i was pleasantly surprised.  the serving size was reasonable.  four 2-bite pieces served on butter lettuce and topped with crispy noodle things.  very enjoyable.\n<mark>Scallop</mark> <mark><mark>Whole <mark>1/2 Maine Lobster</mark></mark> with Wasabi Pepper</mark> sauce - again, a pretty good-sized serving. the sauce was phenomenal although i do wish there was more of a wasabi kick.  i'm no wuss about spiciness but the pepper in this kept choking me up.  \n\ndessert:\ncaramel chocolate mouse - i thought this sounded rather ordinary until i looked at the ingredient list.  globe of chocolate filled halfway with mousse (very light and delicate), topped with a toffee disc, topped <mark>Squid with Shiso</mark> citrus granite, topped with caramel \"caviar\"; everything sat on top of a thick coconut sauce, dusting of brown powder sugar and crispy japanese rice.  best dish we had all night.  loved it.  i could have had 3 more.\n\nservice was great with several lapses here and there.  the busboys were impeccable.  our server got less and less attentive with the arrival of his other tables.\n\nthe quality of the food was excellent and did not disappoint.  i'm no stranger to paying several bills for dinner but for whatever reason, i did feel that food was somewhat overpriced here.  or maybe for what we paid, i thought the food should have been 5-star.", 
            "the visit was on a labor day sunday around 6pm.  the last visit to this particular nobu was back in 2003 when i didn't know the difference between a piece of foie and a rubber sole.  i recall having the chef special back then as well, but the omakase this time was definitely more enjoyable.  this was probably due to the fact that i wasn't three sheets to the wind this time.  being married does these things.\n\nthere were those that chose the bronze omakase ($100) and those that went for the silver ($150) like yours truly, and boy was there ever a difference.  there were major discrepancies between the cuts and also the types of meats served.  the sashimi and the speciality dishes also had noticeable differences.  it's not to say that the 100 dollar omakase wasn't good, but it wasn't great...at least from my vantage point.\n\nthere's about a zillion details i will be leaving out, such as the dried flakes of hoo-haa sprinkled with a drizzle of the thinger thang.  so use your imagination..\n\ncourse 1 - a bonito sashimi.\ncourse 2 - amaebi splashed with hot oil, chawan mushi with truffle and crab eggs at the bottom, kampachi sashimi with dried miso flakes.\ncourse 3 - toro sashimi <mark>King Crab with Amazu Ponzu</mark> ginger sauce <mark>Yellowtail and Jalapeno</mark> sauce topped with a bunch of edible flowers which made it all purdy and crap.\ncourse 4 - seared <mark>Scallop</mark> on a bed of sea beans.\ncourse 5 - kobe beef (served medium) with pan fried <mark>Teppan Style Foie Gras</mark>.\ncourse 6 - sushi set (nigiri) <mark>Inaniwa Pasta with Lobster</mark> broth and <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark>.  the set consisted of - toro, abalone, spanish mackerel, eel, tai (<mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark>) and tamago.\ncourse 7 - an array of sweets including <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark>, chocolate looking souffle thing, fresh fruits and other sugary confections we couldn't stay for because we were already late for the friggin cirque du pouffay show.\n\n..\n\nall in all, a great meal.  i enjoyed the silver omakase at matsuhisa better, the wife liked this dinner much better.  definitely a strong 4 star, but nowhere near a five.  the highlight of the meal for me was the foie served over the kobe.  the dish was so luxurious i really was at a loss for words as i was enjoying every delectable bite.  the slice of black truffle in the chawan mushi gives you a big mule kick in the face which was in short, heavenly.  \n\ni was surprised to find that i liked the non sushi dishes better than the raw, but is it such a huge surprise?  we live in cities like la, sf, ny, etc. where quality ingredients are so readily available.  i've had sashimi as good if not better in other restaurants.  most don't serve it with the detail and ingenuity like mr. nobu matsuhisa, but it takes way too much money to surprise this sushi cowboy.\n\ni truly don't mean to sound snobbish, but there's only so many ways to serve up a nice slab of toro.  i'm more impressed these days by the way chefs serve up foie.  and i am totally infatuated with bone marrow.\n\n..\n\ni've said too much.  \n\ni am off to eat.\n\nedit:\n\ni don't know if it was because we were in vegas, but i felt like everything was a bit contrived.\n\n*shrugs*", 
            "after being seated, our table was presented a single drink menu, and left alone for fifteen minutes. our waiter seemed a little miffed when he asked what we were going to start with to drink and i told him that we'd like to see food menus. i found it presumptuous and manipulative to leave us with a drink menu and that much free time. we are in vegas, i know, but when you're willing to pay for a nice meal, i expect a little more tact on behalf of the servers.\n\nour waiter was also very quick to tell us how he thought we should move through the menu, all the while, mispronouncing common japanese dishes.\n\nwe tried a number of different dishes and rolls from the blue fin toro to <mark>Spicy Miso Chips <mark>Nobu Crispy Rice with Big Eye Tuna</mark> or <mark>Scallop</mark></mark>, <mark>Fresh Water Eel</mark>, albacore, and <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark>. everything was... good. not impressive, certainly not memorable... just good.\n\nthe interior of this location was bland. one of my co-workers mentioned that the decoration on the walls looked like large ironing boards, which was a fair assessment. the main dining area was too bright for a comfortable dinner, and had us sitting around the kind of small, wood topped table you might find yourself at while having lunch at your favorite sandwich shop.\n\nthe banana cake <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> cream <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark> was a high note, although the spoonful <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark> that they tried to pass off as a scoop made me feel like i was caught in a scene from american psycho. \n\nfor all the noise i heard about nobu being something special, i left feeling uninspired, and with a reminder to myself why finding those one of a kind, family run japanese restaurants is such a treat.", 
            "if it were only about the sushi, nobu would get 5 stars from me. but, i knock off 2 stars for service. we walked in on a saturday night and got seats at the sushi bar, which is the place to be. we went with our sushi chef's suggestions, which were nobu's <mark>House Special</mark>, including \"new-style sashimi.\" these consist of the best fish, <mark>White Fish <mark>Scallop <mark>Salmon <mark>Oyster <mark>Beef <mark>Yuba Sashimi New Style</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark>, with delicate sauces and garnishes: <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark>, live octopus with a peruvian chili paste, whitefish and salmon <mark>King Crab with Amazu Ponzu</mark> sauce, tuna <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark>-mustard sauce. everything was first-class, including the junmai daiginjo sake.\n\nthen, i ordered the <mark>Bento Box</mark> chocolate cake dessert. we were told it would take 8 minutes to cook. no problem - our bellies were happily full of sashimi. 20 minutes later, however, still no dessert, and we finally were able to flag someone down to check on it. another ten minutes went by. our waiter then came out to tell us there was a mixup in the kitchen and our cake went to another table. he tried to give us a plateful <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark> to tide us over - this didn't go over well, as the last thing we wanted was to eat a plateful <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark> and then a chocolate cake. another ten minutes or so, the dessert came out. it was excellent, but frankly wasn't worth waiting over half an hour for. we ask ed for the check while still eating...took another ten minutes...gave the credit card and another ten minutes went by...waiter came out to tell us the credit card isn't clearing and do we want to give another card? by this point, well over an hour had gone by since dessert was ordered and we just wanted to leave already. \n\nwhen our check finally arrived, they did charge us for the dessert that took over 30 minutes to arrive at our table. when i mentioned this to the server, he took it right off the bill. but i was miffed that i even had to ask - the right thing to do would have been to take it off in the first place.\n\ntoo bad, since up until we ordered dessert we were very pleased with the sushi our wonderful chef served us. even for a saturday night in vegas, the service was unacceptably unresponsive for such a high-end restaurant.",

            "my first visit to a nobu outpost was about 5 years ago at nobu next door in new york city.  at that point i was still evolving into the foodie that i am today, and for some reason, i absolutely loved the hot spot.  the food was innovative; the atmosphere was exclusive; and snagging a table was a super-heroic feat.  in the years that have passed since, nobu has expanded, and i have also eaten at their nobu 57 in manhattan and the vegas location.  as food culture and my passion for it have evolved, so has my dislike of nobu.  this chain has lost its unique luster, and the quality of the dishes has become a mixed bag.  while some hot and cold courses are better than others, almost anything beats their sushi, which tastes like something ordered from a supermarket's counter.  \n\nmy sushi-fanatic friend and i recently booked a trip to vegas, and her sister had insisted that she try nobu.  i knew that my friend was focused on it, so i went along with the recommendation, though i knew better.  we wound up heading there on our first evening, which at least paved the way for better and better meals as the vacation progressed.\n\nour reservation enabled us to get a table at the crowded spot, and we were immediately seated at a prime location in the center of the dining room.  my friend ordered a glass of sangria, while i opted for a fruity martini, which was so horrifically sweet that i needed to exchange it for a basic glass of sauvignon blanc.  the wine also turned out to be very acidic and not at all similar to the waiter's description.\n\nin terms of the food, we started with two appetizers.  a tiny mound of cool, fresh salmon tartare was immersed in a small bowl of fragrant miso oil and topped with a generous helping of salty caviar.  i am very picky about my tartare, judging it by the amount or lack of flavor it exudes.  this particular version was surprisingly well-seasoned and delicious.  we also sampled one of my favorites - the rock <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark> with spicy sauce.  the succulent fried balls of rock shrimp melted in our mouths, and the spicy mayo sauce <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> a creamy kick. \n\nmy friend stayed firm on our ordering sushi, so we requested the fusion-style <mark>House Special</mark> roll and the <mark>Spicy Scallop</mark> roll.  the <mark>Spicy Scallop</mark> one was pretty flavorful, but their house blend, which included several kinds of fish, had zero taste.  we actually sent it back and did not even bother to order a replacement.\n\nunfor<mark>Tuna (Big Eye)</mark>, i think this restaurant has lost its pizazz, and my friend was not impressed either.  i would really only recommend it for its non-sushi menu items, but even those are inconsistent.", 
            "i ate here for a business dinner and sat at one of the tables but ordered omakase from the sushi bar.\n\nmy colleagues and i went big and went with $150 a person so we had high expectations...\n\ni will try my best to remember everything that came out...(not in order)\n\nthe first dish was a salmon trout sahimi with ikura eggs inside.  the fish had some chewy veins in it, and there wasn't any type of sauce on it - i guess we were supposed to enjoy the 2 components together.\n\nthere was a dish of fatty tuna (otoro) on top of a rock salt.  this was unique and the fish was melty\n\nthere was a <mark><mark>Lobster <mark>Miso Soup</mark></mark></mark> type dish that came out that used delicious dashi broth - anyone who understands umami would've enjoyed this\n\nkobe beef with special mayo sauce was good, but nothing spectacular\n\n<mark>Scallop</mark> in a green guacamole sauce was edible, but the balance wasn't completely there\n\nkanpachi <mark>King Crab with Amazu Ponzu</mark> sauce <mark>Yellowtail and Jalapeno</mark> was good too but trendy\n\nin the end, a full platter of sushi came with the trademark \"nobu\" mark on the egg sushi - this was perhaps the most dissapointing.  the fish tasted bland, the rice was somewhat hardened like it was sitting out for a while, and i really would've liked to end the night on a high note but this last platter of mediocre sushi ended the night on a low note\n\nand the bill at the end was not a pretty sight...\n\ni probably will not go back to nobu again unless it's free.  i was just expecting so much more because of all the hype.  \n\nhowever on the plus side the service is excellent - the servers are all very attentive.  and the atmosphere, being inside the hard rock hotel, is hip and lively.",

            "let me preface this review by saying that i'm a huge self-admitted sushi <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> and my husband is peruvian, so nobu seemed a logical choice for our 7th anniversary dinner.  aside from the villainous penny slots  just outside the door, it was the perfect choice. \n\nwe started out with the <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark>.  yellowtail is by far my favorite raw fish and i've had a similar dish at several excellent bay area restaurants, but this was by far the most flavorful rendering of this dish that i've had. the sashimi was also not razor thin which was an awesome <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> bonus (honestly, i've gotten use to the fact that fine dining, particularly in vegas, means small portions and high prices so the amount of fish was a pleasant surprise. \n\nnext, we tried the tiradito nobu style <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> type of halibut like fish.  now, here the fish was razor thin, but came out with a dot of rocoto, a block of rock salt, the traditional lime juice and a side of cilantro.  my husband says this is exactly what tiradito is supposed to taste like, which makes me want to spend significantly more time in peru.  it was amazing.\n\nwe then moved on to the <mark>Black Cod Miso</mark> next and honestly, this was the only part of the meal that i was underwhelmed by.  i know that this is supposed to be the signature hot dish at nobu, but i've had a very similar dish at both morimoto napa and at hyakumi at cesar's palace and the texture of the fish wasn't the melt in your mouth awesomeness that i have come to expect from the dish. the flavor was right on, and if i'd never had black cod before, i would have loved it.  \n\nso, we moved back to the cold dishes and tried the <mark>White Fish <mark>Scallop <mark>Salmon <mark>Oyster <mark>Beef <mark>Yuba Sashimi New Style</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark> salmon sashimi (<mark>White Fish <mark>Scallop <mark>Salmon <mark>Oyster <mark>Beef <mark>Yuba Sashimi New Style</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark> because it's served with ginger, <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> other amazing deliciousnesss that i can't recall right now), finishing off the savory with the toro green onion maki (cut).  they were both amazing. \n\nwhat shocked me was how incredibly amazing the two <mark>Dessert</mark> we had were.  we tried the <mark>Bento Box</mark>, a flourless chocolate cake with house-made green tea <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark>, and this peach cobbler like dish with almond miso crumble and ginger <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark>.  i don't know if anyone else finds some green tea <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark> to sometimes taste vaguely like lipstick, but this <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark> was delicate and a beautiful companion to the rich chocolate cake.  the warm peaches with the crumble and (again not overpowering) ginger <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark> was a highlight of my whole trip to vegas.  (and i'm not really a dessert person)\n\nokay, this review is way too long, and i didn't even mention the impeccable service.  i can't wait to go back and wish there was a nobu in the bay area.", 
            "this is the 2nd time i've been to nobu las vegas, the first time was probably 8 years ago and i remember loving the food!  this time, i was underwhelmed and here are the reasons why:\n\n1. <mark>White Fish <mark>Scallop <mark>Salmon <mark>Oyster <mark>Beef <mark>Yuba Sashimi New Style</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark> sashimi isn't really new anymore, it's been around for a dang long time and to be honest, it's kinda played out.  s.b. and i both agreed that the plain sashimi was way better.  one suggestion would be to keep the sauces on the side rather than drowning the delicate fish...\n2. confusing menu - they had filet mignon in about 4 places on the menu, all with cryptic descriptions and different prices - once on the specials, twice on the hot items, and again on the last page.  i asked the waiter what was the difference between them all, and he wasn't able to articulate it.  we settled on the one with uni butter and peruvian potato salad ($50), it was char grilled and tender, but the cabernet sauce was way too sweet.\n3. the format made me think of a deconstructed combo plate, where you pick and choose off of the different menus, but in the end you basically had a combo plate - complete <mark>Chilean Sea Bass with Black Bean, Dry Miso, or Balsalmic Teriyaki</mark> chicken, salad, <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark>!\n\ndon't get me wrong, the food was still very good, but the experience just didn't have the same wow factor.  i guess back in the day, this was kinda revolutionary for a japanese restaurant.  it was high end, high quality, modern ambiance, and modern preparation, but 10 years later, after everyone and their mother has copied this format, it's just common.\n\nback to the drawing board nobu!",

            "i was skeptical, but nobu delivered. i just finished dinner with a friend of mine and i had to write a review before i forgot the details. let's just get to the chase.\n\nmy friend and i walked in and i asked our server what the best three dishes were. he then recommend these three. i felt like a stuck up food critic requesting the chef hit me with his best shot. but i often do this for restaurants that i've never been to. after dinner, i find myself recommending the same. here's the pro and cons:\n\n1) toro carpaccio- okay, $70 for six pieces of fish can be a little on the steep side, but hey, i had to know what it was about. now i know and here's the scoop. the toro is incredibly delicious. it is amazingly tender, quite possibly the most tender toro i've ever had. the fish alone is a star, but the flavor profile that the chefs prepare is pretty impressive too. capers, truffle shavings, truffle oil <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> dressing over greens really hit the mark. i will say that there was a little too much soy sauce for my taste (that's right, i'm chinese and i'm saying it). i would request they served the sauce on the side, but fear they will substitute excess soy sauce with hate.\n\n2)<mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark>- this was almost my favorite dish of the night had it not been for the sheer flavor of the toro. the yellowtail is served as one would expect from an expensive sushi restaurant: fresh, flavorful, tender and seasoned according. the jalapeno slice was perfect- excellent spice without burning my mouth. i would actually recommend this as a first dish. \n\n3) <mark>Black Cod Miso</mark>- i thought this was a little overrated by the other reviews. cooked to near perfection, the cod was warm inside but seared and slightly crispy outside. the miso glaze wasn't much to look at. for me, it resembled gravy. i've seen others' pictures and theirs looks much nicer. nevertheless, the dish was great. i actually prefer black cod cooked slightly medium, but cooked to the core with awesome texture. sweet miso sauce finished off the dish and made it very enjoyable. \n\n4)<mark>Sea Urchin</mark> sashimi or sushi!!! just order it. \n\nmy friend and i were pretty hungry and ordered other dishes but i must say that they didn't exactly knock me off my feet. overall, many of the other dishes were very good, but just not amazing. here's the list:\n\n-<mark>Salmon Skin</mark> hand roll- thin slices of <mark>Salmon Skin</mark> with gobo, rice and seasoning. nice to have a place serve quality over quantity when it comes to the <mark>Salmon Skin</mark>.\n\n-baracuda <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark>- $40 for six slices of barracuda. very interesting texture as i haven't had barracuda before. the lemon/citrus sauce was a bit too much. again, i see this as how the chef intends the dish to be enjoyed, so i simply eat and keep my comments to myself. \n\nlive scallop- again, great cut of <mark>Scallop</mark>, but nothing special to write home about. it was nice that it was served with muscle in ponzu sauce. \n\n<mark>White Fish <mark>Scallop <mark>Salmon <mark>Oyster <mark>Beef <mark>Yuba Sashimi New Style</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark> oyster- four pieces of kumamoto oysters served ready to enjoy. so you have to eat it the way they prepare the seasoning.\n\ncrispy rice w/ <mark>Nobu Crispy Rice with Big Eye Tuna</mark>- for lack of a better term, it's japanese tatter tots. square rice cubes deep fried served with essentially tuna poke. well prepared, tasty, but nothing special. \n\nall in all, it was a great experience. my general assessment is that nobu serves dishes with strong flavor profiles. not exactly my cup of tea. maybe i'm a fond believer that less is more and that the fish should speak for itself. however, i can appreciate the fact that a chef's dish is his own art. so i eat with an open mind and share my interpretation. hope this helps.", 
            "this place came highly recommended to us by a waiter at another restaurant (thanks for the complete disappointment eduardo!).  these are the dishes i tried:\n\n- <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> - was spectacular!  the flavors of this dish were very fresh and enjoyable\n\n- <mark>White Fish <mark>Scallop <mark>Salmon <mark>Oyster <mark>Beef <mark>Yuba Sashimi New Style</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark> sashimi salmon - was basically thin slices of poached salmon drowning in sesame oil\n\n- albacore sushi - thin slice, nothing special...\n\n- salmon sushi- thin slice, nothing special...\n\n- spicy <mark>Big Eye Tuna Roll</mark>- wasn't spicy and the nori wrap was gummy\n\noverpriced and completely not worth it.\n\nand my new pet peeve - do not wipe the table down to prep for the next customer while i am still sitting at the table waiting for my check.  clearing the table is fine, but seriously?  it's completely rude and i think after we dropped $200.00 and only took up about 45 minutes of their time, they could have waited- especially since there were plenty of empty tables around us.  will never go back.",

            "whatever god you believe in, thank them for the creation of nobu, because dear lord it is by far and away the best sushi i've ever laid my taste buds on! it may also happen to be the most expensive sushi on the planet, but it if you love sushi, it is worth every penny! \n\ni would be willing to bet that just about anything on the menu is nothing short of amazing, but my favorites included the yellowtail sashimi with jalape\\u00f1o, garnished with cilantro (which they also offer as a roll) and the <mark>Spicy Scallop</mark> roll. now one of the cool things about nobu is that not only do they know how to do sushi, but they have perfected a number of imported kobe/wagyu beef dishes as well. my favorite was the wagyu beef tataki, which is thinly sliced (similar to sashimi), perfectly marbled, lightly seared beef that requires little to no chewing...i'm telling you, it literally melts in your mouth! my drink of choice was a very refreshing pineapple martini, which was the perfect balance to the spice of much of our food selections--if you like a sweet drink, i highly recommend it!\n\nthe atmosphere is what i would call \"high class-zen\" with river rocks, bamboo and ambient lighting abound...and it's even more hip and beautiful at night! vegas has a ton of great restaurants, but if you find yourself with a sushi craving in sin city, do yourself a favor and rush on over to nobu...and if your mouth doesn't water over raw fish, head over anyway...it's sure to be one of your best dining experiences in the city!", 
            "we planned to have dinner with our friends who live in vegas on one night of our two night stay there recently. after scouring the restaurant recommendations from my friend, we decided on nobu. sometimes i have to be in the mood for sushi, i don't always crave it like other people i know, so i was worrying about committing to a reservation. i was also worried about having to pay a million dollars (slight exageration; i don't even have a million dollars, and if i did, i would only spend half on wine) for any good wine. (true story, i made the mistake of ordering a glass of wine at the bar in the casino at the flamingo (don't ask) one night and it had me wishing for manischewitz.)\n\nok - back to the matter at hand: nobu has now made me crave sashimi, sushi and all japanese food all the time. not only did the server rattle off, in detail, and totally and completely from her memory, just about every item listed on the menu, but the food was amazing. i die. we had a smattering of everything from each \"category\" and honestly, went a bit overboard, but it was a meal well worth going over board on. \n\nwe dined on:\n\n-edamame\n-<mark><mark>Lobster <mark>Miso Soup</mark></mark></mark>\n-tempura fried rock shrimp <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> type of delicious citrusy, creamy sauce\n-<mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> (out of this world)\n-red <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark> (also, amazing)\n-salmon <mark>White Fish <mark>Scallop <mark>Salmon <mark>Oyster <mark>Beef <mark>Yuba Sashimi New Style</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark> sashimi, which was lightly seared and served with green onion, absolutely delicious\n-<mark>Soft Shell Crab</mark> roll\n-spicy <mark>Big Eye Tuna Roll</mark> (cause, come on, you gotta round out the meal)\n\nthe dessert was good but unremarkable. i'm more about the main event.\n\ncap that <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> amazing gin cocktail that i now forget the name of and two glasses of hellaciously expensive, but delicious, sauvignon blanc, and this is one of the top meals i have had in my little life thus far... \n\nin short, take your gambling winnings to nobu and order everything the server suggests.", 
            "perfection. i love sushi and have been to several nobu restaurants (both new york locations, san diego, bahamas, los angeles) and this place is my favorite. i've been to this nobu over 10 times and look forward to returning. \n\nthe food at any nobu is consistently out of this world but what makes this location my favorite is the staff. not only can each staff member be a model but everyone on staff is attentive, efficient, and interesting. \n\nthings to order:\n- yellowtail jalepeno sashimi\n- butter lettuce cod\n- <mark>White Fish <mark>Scallop <mark>Salmon <mark>Oyster <mark>Beef <mark>Yuba Sashimi New Style</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark> toro sashimi\n- negi toro hand roll \n- kobe sashimi with hot rocks\n- rock <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark>\n- <mark>Soft Shell Crab</mark> special \n- <mark>Artichoke Salad</mark> (without noodles)\n- yk35 sake\n- peach bellini\n- japanese whiskey flight \n- coconut-lime sake\n- <mark>Bento Box</mark>\n\nlast time we were in we had andrew as our server. super great guy. he gave us some excellent recommendations and was very friendly and professional. i'm going to request to sit in andrew's section every time i go back. \n\nof course i wish nobu wasn't so expensive but i still think it's well worth every penny.", 
            "not really impressed with nobu. we dined at their hard rock location with 4 people last night and our expectations were not met. it's not that the quality is bad, but for the money you spend you simply expect more.\n\nfor starters we had the <mark>White Fish <mark>Scallop <mark>Salmon <mark>Oyster <mark>Beef <mark>Yuba Sashimi New Style</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark> salmon sashimi and the yellowtail jalape\\u00f1o sashimi. both were very good. however, the rolls we ordered afterwards left a lot to be desired. \n\nthe ambience could also be a lot better. the design reminded me more of a japanese ramen kitchen.", 
            "four of us dined at nobu on feb 28th. i was very disappointed in the quality, texture, and flavor of the seafood dishes. also, the waitstaff seemed rushed and it was extremely loud. those two elements combined made it a very chaotic ambiance. we ordered $400 (overpriced) worth of food and drinks. the following are dishes i had sampled.\n\nspicy miso lotus chips <mark>Nobu Crispy Rice with Big Eye Tuna</mark> & scallop - the chips were crispy and not oily. the tuna was ok. the <mark>Scallop</mark> were not. something was off.\n\n<mark>Shishito Peppers</mark> - i loved these peppers. they are full of flavor yet not spicy. i could snack on them all day. \n\n<mark>Mushroom Soup</mark> - this tasted meaty and delicious.\n\ntoro (blue fin) <mark>Toro (Blue Fin) <mark>Yellowtail and Scallion</mark></mark> sushi roll - i did not like this at all. the texture of the fish seemed off to me.\n\n<mark>Sea Urchin</mark> nigiri - the texture and flavor was ok.\n\n<mark>Chicken Kushiyaki</mark> (teriyaki & anticucho) - ok. a bit dry and overcooked. \n\nteriyaki <mark>Tenderloin of Beef</mark> - good.", 
            "this is one of my favorite places to eat in vegas. the first time i ate there last year in june during a conference and thought \"i'd fly here to eat\". then i went back the second night. i've been back twice since then and it doesn't disappoint. in the 4 times i've eaten there i've sat in the bar 3 times. i like the casual vibe and the waiter remembered me from months ago. \n\nwe always start with the shrimp app that is deep fried and covered in deliciousness. i compare it to the bang bang shrimp at bonefish, but nobu's is better. \n\nwe had the miso cod again, and it was even better this time. we also had several roles. i wasn't blown away with the yellow tail <mark>Yellowtail and Jalapeno</mark>, but found the tempura shrimp very good. we got the <mark>Scallop</mark> in garlic sauce and they are incredible, soft, moist and the flavor is wonderful. i like to let the bar tender make some suggestions but the favorites are absolutely the shrimp, cod and <mark>Scallop</mark>. next time we will have to try something a bit different!"

            "my buddy and i went to nobu this past friday night at 9:30 for their omasake chef choice tasting menu. we had very few disappointments. they sat us right away at the bar, tables would have been 15 minutes even with our reservations.  lots of good energy in the restaurant, lots of japanese yelling back and forth from the waiters and sushi chefs.  we split a $50 bottle of nonfiltered very fragrant nigori sake cold which was smooth and easy to drink. the small bits of rice at the bottle of the bottle reminded me of red wine sediment as a good thing. \n\nthe first course came out quick and cold. a chilled patty of toro tartar in a soy wasabi sauce topped <mark>Yellowtail or Salmon <mark>Blue Fin <mark>Toro Tartare</mark> with Royal Ossetra Caviar</mark></mark>, served with a baby silver spoon.  it was tender, smooth, rich and melt in your mouth.  the caviar was not memorable.  an a+ start and an expensive dish on their regular menu. next was 4 pieces per plate of thin cut fresh octopus topped with a cilantro leaf, a dot of super hot sauce, finished with citrus, like ceviche.  pretty good.  next was another cold appetizer of rice paper wrapped greens with a piece of raw ebi sweet shrimp, dressed with a fantastic sesame ginger sauce with a fried prawn head on the side.  my buddy especially liked the tempura batter on the <mark>Sweet Shrimp with Fried Head</mark> and the dressing.  i will personally come to your house and kill you if you do not eat the fried prawn head. \n\nthen started the hot plates.  first was the ever famous <mark>Black Cod Miso</mark> cod, a bit too sweet for my buddy but it did not keep us from both licking the plates.  a small piece of tender fish which just went on and on and kept melting in our mouths.  flavor of fish hard to come through past miso and sweetness.  like fish candy in a good way.  my friend said that an improvement would be to torch and crisp up the skin before putting on the sauce which would give some texture contrast and make the dish over the top.  $23 on the regular menu.  next was the beef tenderloin toban yaki style with a shitake and enokitake mushrooms and a piece of thin asparagus in a soy broth. beef very lean, not as melt in your mouth as i would like.  my buddy would have liked a nice piece of ribeye cap instead but who wouldn't.  the dish is served spitting hot on a mini hot plate and when they raise the cover in front of you, the steam envelopes you warmly.  try not to get the grease on you. \n\nnext was the nigiri sushi course of 5 pieces along with a nice clam <mark><mark>Lobster <mark>Miso Soup</mark></mark></mark>. we got a piece of <mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> (mmmm), magura tuna (so tender), yellowtail (yum), clam (a bit tough) and <mark>Sea Eel</mark> which was the most tender fall apart <mark>Sea Eel</mark> i have ever tasted.  the sushi rice <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> fill you to the gills by that point and then they hit you with the dessert which was a bento presentation of a warm flowerless chocolate lava cake with lots of lava and very little cake and a very good not sweet green tea <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark>.   this just put the nail in the coffin.  we were stuffed, but we couldn't stop eating since it was so good.  \n\nthe restaurant closed at 11pm on a friday night, but we will remember the meal for a long time coming.  next time i'm in vegas i plan to make it a point to return and see what the chef choice is at that point in time.  this was the $100 omasake.  the $150 would have <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> some kobe beef and <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> and there.  we were very happy with our choice.  i think the meal was an absolute bargain for the price.", 
            "bluf...the dining highlight of my trip to vegas with my girlfriend was our dinner at nobu.  this was my third trip to nobu, each time having had the chef's omakase tasting menu.  nobu's tasting menu is a thoughtfully composed meal served kaiseki-style (sort of a themed meal) that seeks to tie together individual dishes by attributes like taste, texture, and temperature to enhance the overall experience of the meal.  since there isn't a set menu, you select the price point you're willing to pay and the chef and the kitchen staff prepares an appropriate amount of courses using whatever exotic ingredients they deem fit.  we both received 9 courses with sake pairing. \n\nfirst course:  we started with a kumamoto oyster wrapped in <mark>Smoked Salmon</mark> topped with a osetra caviar, served on an endive leaf in an asparagus \"boat\" with accompanied by sweet <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> miso sauces.  a masterful start!  the 5 basic tastes were tastefully and elegantly captured together in a single dish! \n\nsecond course:  shima-aji sashimi served in a tosazu (vinegared sardines) gel\\u00e9e with micro celery and \"sea grapes\" kelp...garnished with pickled turnip.  a great all-around dish, but the pickle turnip was the ingredient that put it over the top!\n\nthird course:  bluefin tuna sashimi topped <mark>Squid 'Pasta' with Light Garlic</mark> pur\\u00e9e and sliced serrano chilies with jalape\\u00f1o emulsion over brown rice salsa.  i love sashimi, but the garlicky goodness and spiciness from the chilies was amazing.  the brown rice salsa was damn tasty in its own right!\n\nfourth course:  <mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> and seared sweet shrimp <mark><mark>Nobu's Moriawase Sashimi Salad</mark></mark> served with m\\u00e2che, peppercorn, <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Whole <mark>1/2 Maine Lobster</mark></mark> <mark>Roasted Poussin with Spicy Lemon</mark></mark> dressing.   another success!  the peppercorns gave it the spicy notes that greatly accented the raw fish.\n\nintermezzo:  a <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark>...a simple yet refreshing palate cleanser that marked the transition from cold dishes to hot.\n\nfifth course:  pan-seared seabass, seasonal mushrooms, and wild ramps served in a <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> sauce.  as much as i loved the seabass, the earthy mushrooms and ramps nearly stole the show in this dish!\n\nsixth course:  grilled wagyu beef with seared <mark>Teppan Style Foie Gras</mark> served over yellow sweet corn and snap peas <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark>-mirin reduction.  the oh-so-tender australian-raised wagyu beef paired nicely with the perfectly seared <mark>Teppan Style Foie Gras</mark>.  \n\nseventh course:  dashi <mark>Inaniwa Pasta with Lobster</mark> and enoki mushroom with japanese greens.  so simple, yet such an incredibly satisfying dish!  they didn't skimp on the lobster, either.  in many ways, this was my favorite dish of the night.\n\neighth course:  a selection of sushi...otoro (fatty tuna), tasmanian sea trout, <mark>Sea Eel</mark>, a fish i can't recall, mirugai (geoduck), and tamago (egg omelet).  i love sushi.  i loved all of these nigiri!\n\nninth course:  shiso (?) panna cotta with strawberry \"caviar\", an understated but very satisfying closer to our meal.  the \"caviar\" was made to resemble ikura or salmon roe and was a very nice, creative touch.\n\nas for our sake, chris (i think that was his name), our lead server, informed us that nobu imports its sake from japan and that it's made especially for nobu.  i'm not an expert, at all, on the finer aspects of sake.  suffice it to say, our pairings were very nice, with subtle, yet interesting differences between each glass and went well with each dish.  chris did a great job all-around job taking care of us.  we had a very leisurely meal, never feeling rushed, but we never had to wait for our next course or glass of sake.  the timing was impeccable!\n\ni'm really not the type of person to toss out superlatives casually, but our meal was arguably one of the best meals i've ever had...at least since i've started yelping!  each dish was memorable and no single dish clearly stood out as the best since they were all outstanding!  it takes a lot of hair-splitting to even pick a dish that was less satisfying that the rest but if i had to pick one, it was the wagyu and <mark>Teppan Style Foie Gras</mark> course...and that was only due to the impression that the accompaniments on other dishes were more exciting than the sweet corn and snap peas.  if you're in vegas for one night and can only eat at one place while you're there, go to nobu and have the omakase tasting menu!  you won't regret it!"

            "matsuhisa nobu, i salute you! your food is divine. i am jealous of your restaurant's decor. i envy your river stone wall. i wish i was a celebrity so i wouldn't have to wait so damn long to eat in your wickedly awesome dining establishment! i simultaneously loathe and love you...in a platonic sort of way, of course...\n\nnobu (in the hard rock hotel & casino) is one of my all-time favorite restaurants. i've also been to matsuhisa's in los angeles, but there's nothing like the nobu experience. it's vegas baby!!\n\nanyway, i've found that it's so much easier to make reservations at nobu if you're actually staying in the hotel (which is awesome, by the way). one of my college roommates' sisters used to work there and hooked me up with a discounted suite on two occasions...score! it also doesn't help if you're pretty slick with the pass-the-twenty-as-you-shake-the-host/hostess'-hand-in-order-to-get-a-table-faster bit. never worked for me...kept dropping the money...\n\nback to the food: pricey? abso-friggin'-lutely! take one look at the place. nice furniture, kitschy bamboo sake bottles and cups, rice paper wall paneling, indoor bamboo plants, wall inlaid with black river stones, huge sushi bar, and you mustn't forget about the main ingredient: location, location, location. the hard rock is practically a sure-fire way to keep this place packed with gorgeous-looking people. they need some way to pay the rent, right?\n\nbut is the food tasty? hells to the yeah, it is! every single dish i've ever had here has been delicious...even the ones that i'm usually not too keen on were better than other places (mirugai for example: here = tasty; other sushi places = like chewing on a salted piece of bicycle tire). the sea bass is prepared very well (nice and moist, flaky too), the rock shrimp is fried to perfection, the sashimi is beautifully presented, and the tataki is to die for...*sigh* if only i could be there right now... their <mark>Dessert</mark> are just as good as their appetizers and entrees. the last time i was there they had a passion fruit sorbet that could knock you out with its incredible flavor (oooh...my mouth's watering just thinking about it...and now i've drooled on my keyboard...how embarrassing...).\n\nas i mentioned before, this place can get pricey. but, if you have the funds and the stomach for it, you have to go with the omakase (chef's choice). tip: let your server know what you're partial to and what doesn't exactly float your boat in the food department (i'm not a big fan of uni (<mark>Sea Urchin</mark>), so i let 'em know that...thanks nobu!). i believe there are different levels to the omakase dinner, too...at least there was the last time i visited. but, if omakase's not the thing for you, go a la carte...that way you can try a variety of nobu's offerings. it's all up to you.\n\nsince nobu's in a vegas hot-spot, be prepared for celebrity sightings as well. the first time i ate there, my wife and i were seated next to a group of porn stars (they had to be with their excessively tight and skimpy clothing, the gratuitous cleavage (both male and female), the over-tanned, near-leather quality to their skin, and (of course) the cowboy hats!) c'mon! who wears a cowboy hat in a japanese restaurant while wearing practically nothing?! porn stars! that's who! i also walked past ex-san francisco 49er quarterback jeff garcia, kansas city chiefs tight end tony gonzalez, enrique iglesias, and enrique iglesias' mole (pre-divorce, that is).\n\nevery visit to nobu is like dinner and a show! i think that alone gives me my money's worth.", 
            "only complaint is that san francisco doesn't have a nobu!\n\ngreat meal. we went with chef matsushisa's omakase menu and gave the chef no limitations with food or money...so it ended up being a little pricer that we thought. none the less...amazing and worth every cent!\n\nstaff was very knowledgeable with the sake selection.\n\nsome favorites:\nblack cod <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark>\nlive scallop\n<mark>Sea Urchin</mark>\n<mark><mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark></mark>\ntoro with spicy miso and caviar\n\natmosphere is lively and loud.", 
            "when nobu opened in new york city, it created a sensation.  reservations were nearly impossible to get, and its new interpretation of traditional japanese food was widely praised.  this led to the inevitable branding of the restaurant; nobu can be found all over the globe.\n\nmeal #1: i found las vegas nobu's sushi highly variable.  the overall quality was ok, but some items (e.g., uni) were poor while others (e.g., ankimo) were good.  orange and honey flavored sake was interesting but probably not worth repeating.\n\n\nmeal #2:  since my first meal, i went to nobu in miami beach, sat in the dining room and had the omakase meal.  i enjoyed that a bit more, so decided to give the vegas location another shot.\n\nthe restaurant looks ok, but nothing great.  it's very noisy, in keeping with the hard rock atmosphere.  the crowd is mostly young, but i think anyone would feel comfortable here; i did.  service is pleasant, although all the servers are running around at full speed.\n\nnow, on to the meal:\n\n    * i chose jyunmai daiginjyo sake.  it wasn't bad, but was a trifle harsh.\n    * small japanese spring roll with balsamic vinaigrette reduction.  good.\n    * trio of raw seafood: sea scallop slice, oyster, ama ebi (raw shrimp).  all served with onion and other spices, although each was slightly different.  good.\n    * seared maguro and a slightly strong flavored fish, <mark>Squid 'Pasta' with Light Garlic</mark> chips and a pickled ginger shoot.  a good combination.  very good.\n    * uni (<mark>Sea Urchin</mark>) <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> white fish, served on sliced eggplant.  the uni was seared and was surprisingly delicious.  there was also a tiny river crab, to be eaten shell and all; interesting for the crunch, not the flavor.  very good.\n    * o toro and a spring roll <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> sauce and radish.  the o toro was good but a little chewy, and the strong sauce tended to overwhelm the tuna.  good to very good.\n    * palate cleanser: intensely flavored, sweet/sour mango sorbet, on top of a red granite with little flavor.\n    * service lapse.  up to this point, courses had been timed well.  at this point, i waited for about 15 minutes, with no explanation.  this was a little annoying.\n    * grilled sea scallop on a bed of mushrooms, bits of seafood, and brown rice.  very good.\n    * <mark>Teppan Style Foie Gras</mark> and kobe beef.  a large hunk of <mark>Teppan Style Foie Gras</mark>; good flavor.  kobe beef very good.  overall, very good to excellent.\n    * service lapse: the next course was supposed to be sushi, followed by <mark><mark>Lobster <mark>Miso Soup</mark></mark></mark>.  they reversed the order, and apologized later.  a minor matter.\n    * <mark><mark>Lobster <mark>Miso Soup</mark></mark></mark>.  better than average; good fish stock flavor, not too salty.  very good.\n    * sushi: o-toro (tuna belly), <mark>Shima Aji</mark> (variety of mackerel?), some kind of crab, unagi (eel).  very good.\n    * fruit papillote.  like a crepe.  the raspberry seeds were very distracting.  fair.\n    * honey <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark>.  very strong honey flavor.  strange, but i liked it.  very good.\n\noverall, the meal was good, but not as good as nobu in miami, and not nearly as good as okada.  at the price they charge ($120), they need to do better.\n\n\nmeal #3: based on past meals, i hadn't planned to return. however, i found myself at the hard rock hotel at meal time, and no other choices looked appealing. i decided to go for unusual choices, hoping this would be a strength. this worked out better. my selections:\n\n    * ankimo (steamed monkfish liver). standard but still very good.\n    * <mark>Hamachi Kama</mark> (grilled yellowtail collar). this is a chunk of fish, skin and bone, served grilled. it may not sound like much, and it's a little difficult to get the flesh out, but it's usually very rich and very tasty. i was both happy and sad with my choice: it was very good, but not as good as elsewhere. if you'd like to try this dish, order it robatayaki style at okada.\n    * live shrimp. these santa barbara shrimp were killed in front of me, so i guess that means they're fresh. they were big and rather chewy; i'm guessing the latter is due to their recent demise. the heads were served tempura style, and were juicy and tasty.\n    * live octopus. i'm not sure that it was live, but slices of the tentacle, served raw, were indeed very fresh tasting - and much less chewy than the cooked version. pretty good.\n\nthis was the most satisfying of my meals at nobu. nothing was stellar, but everything was good.\n\n\n\nnobu's strength is its new take on japanese foods.  its weaknesses are sushi that isn't in the same class with the better places in las vegas, and suspect service.  given such high prices, i'd look elsewhere.", 
            "i'm only giving nobu vegas 3 stars, but part of this could be my fault.  in restrospect, i should not have ordered the omakase sushi as my dinner there.  since nobu is known for his innovative hot and cold dishes, i wish i had ordered a bunch of those instead.  one thing i did get to try was the <mark><mark>Sea Urchin</mark> Tempura</mark>, which was very unique and tasty.\n\nhowever, they really could've made the omakase sushi more interesting and worth the hefty price.  the sushi was fresh and all, but not very innovative or interesting at all.  it was just simple, no-frills negiri sushi.  i've had some fantastic and creative omakase sushi at more humble japanese restaurants, so i thought nobu could've done the same.\n\nperhaps i'll try one of nobu's la restaurants sometime.", 
            "the hype about the miso black cod is true.  tasty.  melts in the mouth.  $23 for it is reasonable.  however the blue fin toro <mark>Yellowtail or Salmon <mark>Blue Fin <mark>Toro Tartare</mark> with Royal Ossetra Caviar</mark></mark> is not worth $32.  it was good but the price is a little over the top. check attached photo.  i love the <mark>Sea Urchin</mark> and eel but then again \ni really love <mark>Sea Urchin</mark> and eel regardless where i eat them.  our waiter is always disappearing. the busser was more attentive than our waiter.  the experience was just okay for me i guess.  it just makes me appreciate other jap restaurants owned by japanese with japanese waiters more.", 
            "travelling is incomplete unless met with great sushi, in my case at least. \n\ni arrived in las vegas, jet lagged after partying my tail feathers off in hong kong for two weeks. and since i had nobu while i was in hong kong(which by the way, was amazing like always) - i thought i'd skip the visit to nobu in las vegas and save some money. \n\nbut my boyfriend was very sweet and surprised me with a rsvp to nobu the night we arrived, so i dragged myself out of bed, dressed up and headed up nobu. \n\ni've been to vegas twice before, many years ago, but never had the chance to try nobu. it was about a $15 cab ride from mandalay bay to hard rock, and when we arrived - we found the restaurant well hidden in the back of the entrance. the ambiance was nice, but nothing compared to the decor in nobu tokyo or hong kong. venue was small in comparison as well. \n\nthe food was great, check out pictures of the sushi/appetizers from that night. \n\nif you are new to nobu, here are a few recommendations from that night.\notoro nigiri - $38\n<mark>Sea Urchin</mark> - $15\nbarracuda - $40\nmonkfish liver(ankimo) - $30\nsquid pasta - $20\n\nand pair them with the nobu beer! by the way, nobu beer costs $15 each in san diego, but costs only $8 in las vegas - don't know why, maybe the higher demand for beer allows them to lower their price?\n\nall and all, nobu las vegas was great....but...\n\ni wish i didn't have to say this, especially since i have such a bias for nobu - but the staff did not treat us the way a $250 bill deserves. it was probably due to the fact that we were a young couple, and didn't look like we had hundred dollar bills in hand to \"rain\" on the waiters. but either they were blind, or the fact that i was carrying an exclusive limited edition louis vuitton bag from japan meant nothing to them. \n\nwaiter made no effort to create a conversation, rushed us from start to end, took five years to refill my hot green tea, yet five seconds to take the american express off my boyfriend's hand. the waiter also talked to me as if i had never heard of nobu in my entire life, he even questioned how i had known about the nobu beer(since i ordered it without advertisement). at that moment i wanted to whip out the photo i took with chef nobu himself in tokyo nobu on my phone, but i thought, even if i did that, what does it proof besides the fact that i am dying for everyone to know that i met chef nobu, and that the waiter is an asshole? \n\nmaybe i was being a little harsh, but i have certain expectations from a restaurant who plans to charge me $250 minimum for dinner. since those expectations weren't met, i am ranting on yelp. \n\nif you want better service, try nobu tokyo or hong kong.", 
            "i was skeptical, but nobu delivered. i just finished dinner with a friend of mine and i had to write a review before i forgot the details. let's just get to the chase.\n\nmy friend and i walked in and i asked our server what the best three dishes were. he then recommend these three. i felt like a stuck up food critic requesting the chef hit me with his best shot. but i often do this for restaurants that i've never been to. after dinner, i find myself recommending the same. here's the pro and cons:\n\n1) toro carpaccio- okay, $70 for six pieces of fish can be a little on the steep side, but hey, i had to know what it was about. now i know and here's the scoop. the toro is incredibly delicious. it is amazingly tender, quite possibly the most tender toro i've ever had. the fish alone is a star, but the flavor profile that the chefs prepare is pretty impressive too. capers, truffle shavings, truffle oil <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> dressing over greens really hit the mark. i will say that there was a little too much soy sauce for my taste (that's right, i'm chinese and i'm saying it). i would request they served the sauce on the side, but fear they will substitute excess soy sauce with hate.\n\n2)<mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark>- this was almost my favorite dish of the night had it not been for the sheer flavor of the toro. the yellowtail is served as one would expect from an expensive sushi restaurant: fresh, flavorful, tender and seasoned according. the jalapeno slice was perfect- excellent spice without burning my mouth. i would actually recommend this as a first dish. \n\n3) <mark>Black Cod Miso</mark>- i thought this was a little overrated by the other reviews. cooked to near perfection, the cod was warm inside but seared and slightly crispy outside. the miso glaze wasn't much to look at. for me, it resembled gravy. i've seen others' pictures and theirs looks much nicer. nevertheless, the dish was great. i actually prefer black cod cooked slightly medium, but cooked to the core with awesome texture. sweet miso sauce finished off the dish and made it very enjoyable. \n\n4)<mark>Sea Urchin</mark> sashimi or sushi!!! just order it. \n\nmy friend and i were pretty hungry and ordered other dishes but i must say that they didn't exactly knock me off my feet. overall, many of the other dishes were very good, but just not amazing. here's the list:\n\n-<mark>Salmon Skin</mark> hand roll- thin slices of <mark>Salmon Skin</mark> with gobo, rice and seasoning. nice to have a place serve quality over quantity when it comes to the <mark>Salmon Skin</mark>.\n\n-baracuda <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark>- $40 for six slices of barracuda. very interesting texture as i haven't had barracuda before. the lemon/citrus sauce was a bit too much. again, i see this as how the chef intends the dish to be enjoyed, so i simply eat and keep my comments to myself. \n\nlive scallop- again, great cut of <mark>Scallop</mark>, but nothing special to write home about. it was nice that it was served with muscle in ponzu sauce. \n\n<mark>White Fish <mark>Scallop <mark>Salmon <mark>Oyster <mark>Beef <mark>Yuba Sashimi New Style</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark> oyster- four pieces of kumamoto oysters served ready to enjoy. so you have to eat it the way they prepare the seasoning.\n\ncrispy rice w/ <mark>Nobu Crispy Rice with Big Eye Tuna</mark>- for lack of a better term, it's japanese tatter tots. square rice cubes deep fried served with essentially tuna poke. well prepared, tasty, but nothing special. \n\nall in all, it was a great experience. my general assessment is that nobu serves dishes with strong flavor profiles. not exactly my cup of tea. maybe i'm a fond believer that less is more and that the fish should speak for itself. however, i can appreciate the fact that a chef's dish is his own art. so i eat with an open mind and share my interpretation. hope this helps.", 
            "first of all, please choose the right nobu restaurant.  you should be going to nobu in hard rock hotel.   if your pocket book is a little tight this is not the place i would recommend you to go. \n\ncold dishes: \nspecial: toro (don't remember what he listed as the garnishes, but it is shown on my pics.  i think this dish was just a little salty. once, you <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> the dressing on top, i like to taste the fish, since it is fresh.)\n<mark>Kelp Salad</mark> 13 (this tasted so fresh, <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> just a little lemon on top of it.  also, helped w/cleaning the palette for the next course) \n<mark>Sea Urchin</mark> 16 (this is from santa barbara, ca which is normally where every japanese restaurant from the west coast gets there uni from.  hmmm..this just tasted like any uni i would have gotten at another bay area restaurant probably no more than 12.00.  oh well, i do love my uni. \n\nhot dishes: \n<mark>Black Cod Miso</mark> 37  (this was cooked well and the miso glaze on top was just right) \n\ngeez i forget the server's name, but he was really great!  knowledgeable about his fish and the menu.  very upscale and modern experience.  this is the 2nd nobu location i have been to, first was in hong kong.  if you like fresh fish w/a twist of fresh ingredients, you just have to come here and experience the taste.  but don't come here if you are looking for affordable specialty sushi rolls, this is not that type of place.  this was the first time my friend had gone to this restaurant, she said it was the best japanese restaurant she has ever been to.  i was so pleased to have taken her there 1st.  hope they do open up in san francisco soon!", 
            "four of us dined at nobu on feb 28th. i was very disappointed in the quality, texture, and flavor of the seafood dishes. also, the waitstaff seemed rushed and it was extremely loud. those two elements combined made it a very chaotic ambiance. we ordered $400 (overpriced) worth of food and drinks. the following are dishes i had sampled.\n\nspicy miso lotus chips <mark>Nobu Crispy Rice with Big Eye Tuna</mark> & scallop - the chips were crispy and not oily. the tuna was ok. the <mark>Scallop</mark> were not. something was off.\n\n<mark>Shishito Peppers</mark> - i loved these peppers. they are full of flavor yet not spicy. i could snack on them all day. \n\n<mark>Mushroom Soup</mark> - this tasted meaty and delicious.\n\ntoro (blue fin) <mark>Toro (Blue Fin) <mark>Yellowtail and Scallion</mark></mark> sushi roll - i did not like this at all. the texture of the fish seemed off to me.\n\n<mark>Sea Urchin</mark> nigiri - the texture and flavor was ok.\n\n<mark>Chicken Kushiyaki</mark> (teriyaki & anticucho) - ok. a bit dry and overcooked. \n\nteriyaki <mark>Tenderloin of Beef</mark> - good."

            "i was in vegas this past weekend for a bachelorette party. and when we found out there was a nobu here (see my nyc review since i had been to that one quite a few times), we had to come! i was in charge of the ordering since no one else from the party had been there. \r\n\r\nthe decor is similar to new york's nobu, but not as big and not as nice. the service is not as good but it's vegas so oh well.\r\n\r\nwe ordered:\r\n\r\npeach martini and lychee martini - very good but strong.\r\n\r\n<mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> and ponzu sauce - this was fucking good. one of my friend's doesn't eat sashimi and she loved this dish. (see below for kristine n's review). they prepared it with about 20 pieces of sashimi on the plate for our big party! it was great!\r\n\r\n<mark><mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> Salad</mark> - of course i had to order this! i love the salad dressing. \r\n\r\nmiso black cod - the cool thing about nobu is that because we had a group of 8, they actually cut the fish in chunks and put them individually on little lettuce wraps so it would be easier to eat. this was fantastic and sweet.\r\n\r\nchilean sea bass w/ mushrooms - the bride-to-be is a sea bass connoisseur and she said this was not chilean sea bass, but just regular sea bass. it was still very good though. yummm.\r\n\r\nsquid pasta - i love the squid pasta here. complimented w/ asparagus. i love asparagus!\r\n\r\nrock <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark> - we choose the butter sauce since the other sauces had been a bit spicy. yummy.\r\n\r\n<mark>Bento Box</mark> - flourless chocolate cake with <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark>. this was better than i remembered from nyc. it's not flourless as in a chocolate bar on a plate - it actually does have a cake - souffle texture to it. it was great, and gooey in the middle. \r\n\r\nmango caramel ice-cream dessert - a light but tasty dessert with caramel bits in it.\r\n\r\none of the girls and i are not big seafood fans, but we loved all the dishes here. (see below for kristine n.'s review!) that tells ya something! everyone thoroughly enjoyed this meal which made me happy because i hoped they would trust my judgement in food. =)\r\n\r\nit was nice because they brought out each dish one-by-one so you aren't stuffing your faces all at once. by the end of the dinner, we felt extremely satisfied but not so full we were going to explode.\r\n\r\nyay, for nobu!!!", 
            "nobu is a great place to splurge when you have time and want to have good japanese food.  a few quick notes about how to eat there.\n\n1, i've heard the omikase is excellent. it's a safe way to try a nice selection of things.\n2, be nice to your waiter, and it will make all the difference. in general, be nice to the person that brings you your food, and you'll have a better, healthier, more hygenic meal, but here, being nice can mean great service, good advice, and a wonderful experience. i have 1 friend who is a waiter there, and if he can't serve me when i go, i make sure one of the other folks who has helped him wait on me before is my waiter, and i've never had a bad meal, bad location, or bad service.\n3, the black cod <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark>, and hamachi <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> and ponzu are  musts on the menu. i also recommend the squid pasta, rock <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark>, <mark><mark>Nobu's Moriawase Sashimi Salad</mark></mark>, and spicy <mark>Big Eye Tuna Roll</mark>.  the spicy <mark>Big Eye Tuna Roll</mark> there is the best version i've ever had.  the black cod is probably the best treatment of cooked fish i've ever consumed.\n4, enjoy the celebrity spotting. i actually sat next to wayne brady (a very nice guy, and super polite to the staff) at one dinner, and tiffany amber thiessen was there a different night. i can't say the same nice things about her that i mentioned about wayne brady.\n\nall in all, a great meal.  and get the nigori sake...best bang for your buck alcohol wise, and very tasty.", 
            "i was really ready to give nobu an average rating - how much can you really pay for fish?  how good could it really be?  it really is that good.\n\ni was in vegas for a bachelorette party <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> girlfriends, and we went to nobu.  i'd been to nobu next door ages ago in nyc...and i thought it was good but not outstanding.  apparently they save the good stuff for the \"real\" restaurant.\n\ni was underwhelmed by the resaurant decor - it seemed a little bit like any generic japanese restaurant.  but the food was awesome.  we had the tuna <mark><mark>Nobu's Moriawase Sashimi Salad</mark></mark> - tuna was so good and the salad dressing was awesome (i love japanese salad dressing), hamachi <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> peppers, salmon sashimi with chives (loved it - and i'm not even a huge salmon fan), miso cod (liked it...but definitely loved the sashimi more) and the real winner i wasn't expecting was this <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark> dish...  tiny pieces of friend shrimp covered in some sort of mayonnaise-y kind of sauce.  delish.  \nto accommodate some non-fish eaters, we got chicken which was fine, but really, who goes to nobu for chicken?  \n\ni may have to take out a second mortgage on my non-existent house, but it was worth it...",

            "this place was excellent. we went with a bunch of people and ordered a bunch of things on the menu. the <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark> was great and the tuna was also excellent.\n\nthe sushi seemed extremely fresh and the cocktail menu is extensive. i had a lychee martini that was cool and also the tea infused vodka. the waiter said the tea vodka isn't a favorite, but if you like tea i think you'll enjoy it. \n\nthe service was great and we managed to get a reservation on a friday night for 6 people (though we did have to do it during the last time slot).", 
            "i really wanted to try nobu after having an amazing experience at morimoto in philly.  i was not disappointed.  we arrived promptly at our reservation time and were seated immediately.  upon being seated we were greeted by our server within moments.    the atmosphere at nobu is much different than morimoto...nobu is more lively and trendy.  \n\nthey have you order a few dishes from the three parts of their menu.  we started with the oysters and the <mark><mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark></mark> which is served in lettuce wraps.  the lettuce wraps were quite good and the oysters were very earthy tasting. \n\nfor our second course we chose the <mark>Creamy Spicy Crab</mark> and the rock <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark> in butter ponzu.  the <mark>Creamy Spicy Crab</mark> may be one of the best dishes i've ever tasted in a restaurant.  at the end of our weekend i asked my brother in law what his favorite thing was about vegas and he responded without hesitation \"eating <mark>Creamy Spicy Crab</mark> at nobu.\"  not the club, not winning $300, not seeing old friends....the <mark>Creamy Spicy Crab</mark>.  \n\nwe chose 4 sushi rolls for our main course, the house roll which is like a rainbow row except the fish on the inside, a spider roll, unagi avocado (not on the menu but they happily prepared it for us) <mark>Yellowtail and Scallion</mark>.  each of the rolls was well prepared and the fish was fresh.\n\nfor dessert we ordered assorted mochi, which caused brother in law to wet himself for the second time that night.  our assortment included tiramisu, pistachio, honeydew, and raspberry.   all were amazing.\n\nthe service was outstanding throughout the night.  the meal was well paced, it wasn't the lingering three hour affair we had at morimoto but we didn't feel rushed at any point.  in the end i felt that the bill was actually fairly reasonable for what we ordered.  including tip and alcohol it came to about $90 a person.  i do have to <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> it did bother me slightly to find that some of the customers were wearing sneakers, open toe sandals (on men) and collarless shirts.  when i made our reservation they informed me that the dress code did not include these things, which is totally fine.  i'm all for getting dressed up to go out to eat, especially in vegas, and especially at a place like nobu, but i do not like it when i go through the effort and others don't have to.", 
            "if we overlook the fact that the restaurant wrote down our reservation for 10 for the wrong night, my group's dining experience here was exceptional and we were pleased that they were still able to seat us despite this error. the service was incredibly fast (3 people from our group were late and we completely finished our meal by the time they arrived,) and the food was fabulous. the flavors were crisp, unique, and every bite of food was like an explosion in my mouth. since we shared all the dishes we ordered, that pretty much means that we only got one bite so we savored it for all that it was worth. damn you nobu for being so expensive! otherwise i would have ordered 2 of everything!\n\na couple of dishes i would recommend trying are:\n-<mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark>\n-toro tartar <mark>Yellowtail or Salmon <mark>Blue Fin <mark>Toro Tartare</mark> with Royal Ossetra Caviar</mark></mark>\n-black cod <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark>\n-rock <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark>\n-new zealand mussels with the garlic sauce\n\n***the must try dish is the fish/<mark>Lobster <mark>Tuna <mark>King Crab <mark>Vegetable <mark>Salmon Nobu Style Taco</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark>!!!***\nthey are not on the menu here, but you can special order them and they are awesome. i have pictures to prove it.", 
            "amazing!!! were the first words i thought of when i was dining and leaving this restaurant.  my best friend recommended this restaurant as we were planning our vegas trip.  i didn't think much about this place when he brought it up, my expectations were pretty much non-existent.  once we got to the restaurant, it was top notch from start to finish.  we ordered quite a bit of different dishes and it was delicious down to the last bite.  our waiter was quite helpful with our decision making and recommendations.  first dish on our table was the fresh <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark>.  this dish is awesome!  the flavoring along with the fresh yellowtail easily makes this my favorite dish at this restaurant.  we also had the monkfish pate, <mark><mark>Nobu's Moriawase Sashimi Salad</mark></mark>, black cod <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark>, broiled yellowtail collar; <mark>Creamy Spicy Crab</mark>, rock <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark> <mark>King Crab with Amazu Ponzu</mark> and creamy spicy sauce.  all around delicious dishes with great visual presentation.  their lychee martini is also worth a mention, a tasty treat.  i highly recommend this restaurant for those who haven't tried it yet.  this is easily one of my top 10 restaurants.  just a wonderful experience from beginning to finish!",

            "nobu.\n\nwell, what can i say?  i've wanted to go to nobu for a really, really long time.  being in vegas for the weekend, i decided this would be the time to do it. \n\nwe started with an assortment of sashimi.  tuna, mackerel (which was completely delicious) and a couple others .... my brain stopped operating clearly after the mackerel.  then a large platter of raw chilean sea bass with enoki and baby bok choy.  a warm ginger infused mushroom broth was ladled over the fish table side which cooked the melt-in-your mouth, luscious bass ever so gently.  mmmmmmm.\nnext came tempura king crab legs with an accompanying  broth (which had sensational body) poured over the tempura right before eating.  it was amazing.  my husbands eyes rolled back into his head- i thought that he was having a seizure.  then came the spicy <mark>Big Eye Tuna Roll</mark> <mark>Eel and Cucumber</mark> roll.  both good.  but the item that stole the show had to be the uni.  and i mean in a bad way.  so i've never had uni.  i know that is super lame.  but i've been waiting until i was at a really good establishment because i wanted to be sure that i was getting the best uni prepared by competent hands.   my fantasy of being super cool vanished in a swift goopy instant.     eeeeeewwww.\nso it came pureed and then wrapped <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark> 'd.  wow.  well, having always prized myself on being somewhat of an adventurous eater i dove in head first, offering myself as the guinea pig.  big mistake!  i take a bite.  the exterior is nice and crisp.  within an instant my mouth was flooded with velvety toxic sea puke, orange ooze dripping on my plate below.  maintaining composure was very difficult- however, this practice will come in handy once the check comes.\n-abalone wasn't much more pleasant- similar flavor with the texture of chewing on somebody's ear.\nthank god a clever distraction appeared soon thereafter the \"uni incident\".  super thin slices of beautifully marbled raw kobe beef on a large platter with six super hot rocks and an assortment of condiments and seasoning.  so we got to cook our own slices of kobe using our chopsticks as our instruments on the hot rocks.  can we say fun?  i've always wanted to do that.\ndessert sounded cool on the menu but in actuality it didn't taste too hot.  i did like the shiso sorbet though.\n\nthe reason why i have given nobu 4 stars instead of 5 is because the fact that i had to go to the skanky, garish, soulless, death trap that is vegas in order to dine there and because of the price.  even as i am writing this i cannot believe what i am about to say.  i am accustomed to spending 250$ or so on a nice dinner .  in this instance i was prepared to pay around 500-550$.  but for a party of four, with no alcohol bill to speak of and 2 people confessing that they were still hungry upon our exiting, the bill came to 700 big ones.  ouch!  gees- i have to confess feeling mildly nauseas directly afterward.  am i just a cheap ol' broad?  or have i gone and acquired some sort of conscience or something?  something just felt really wrong about that.    i just feel like it was self indulgent and empty.  but, then again, i guess that pretty much sums up vegas.", 
            "i agree with ming-jou in the fact that i was totally disappointed at this place. i should have also listened to my friend who went there and was really disappointed at their omakase, but being japanese, i wanted to try their food to see what the hype was about.  we had reservations at 9 pm and although we got there earlier, they didn't seat us till then.  it was shockingly a loud place that we often had to yell at each other to talk and even to order.  also, the crowd was much older than i anticipated.  the interior had a nice asian feel to it with bamboos everywhere, even on the ceilings.\n\nfor starters, we had edamame, yellowtail tartar <mark>Yellowtail or Salmon <mark>Blue Fin <mark>Toro Tartare</mark> with Royal Ossetra Caviar</mark></mark>, <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark>.  the menu was vague that we didn't expect any sauce with the tartar, but to our surprise, it came in a sauce with wasabi that was a little spicy.  i wish the menu would have included more details.  we got to order individual tempura items, which was a \"first\" for me.  we ordered shrimp, broccoli, and sweet potato.  the order came with 2 pieces each.  i liked how it came out really hot with light batter.  also, they were generous with their tempura sauce with daikon-oroshi (grated daikon).  most places give you barely enough sauce.  for dinner, we shared the <mark>Sushi Dinner</mark> which came with 8 nigiri and 6 pieces of tekka maki (<mark>Big Eye Tuna Roll</mark>).  the sushi rice tasted old as it was cold and flat, not warm and plump.  also, the rice portion for a nigiri was much more than it needed.  fish seemed fresh, but the rice was disappointing.  that ruined my dinner.\n\nwe decided to try their dessert since we don't usually order dessert at an asian restaurant.  we tried their miso almond cake which was the best part of my meal.  it came <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> caramel glaze and edamame <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark>.  the cake was yummier than i expected.  \n\noverall, it was not as good as i expected but i'm giving 3 stars for the good dessert and the great service.", 
            "i'm not going to lie--a small part of me dies every time i think about how much we spent here.  but the truth of the matter is, you can't get good sushi without paying for it.  \n\nwe ordered the $100 omakase, the uni tempura set, kabocha tempura, and salmon sashimi.\n\nthe fusion dishes (like the hamachi <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> or the snapper with cucumber <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Whole <mark>1/2 Maine Lobster</mark></mark> <mark>Roasted Poussin with Spicy Lemon</mark></mark> juice) were fun to try but i find that the sauces often overpower the fish, which is the best thing about nobu.  if you have never tried any of their signature dishes, you might want to order at least one of the omakase options, but if you're just looking to enjoy the fish qua fish, then order the sashimi and/or nigiri a la carte.\n\nand yes, let's talk about the fish.  i have never had such a wonderfully buttery miso black cod!  and the toro, maguro, aji, trout, and sake (as in salmon sashimi) simply melted in our mouths.  no biting necessary.  the only low point was that the anago in our complimentary sushi was littered with small fish bones but hey, it was complimentary!  yet another reason why i love nobu.  they know how to treat the ladies right.\n\nas for the tempura, the kabocha was out of season, so it was our bad for ordering it in the first place, but the uni tempura was unlike anything i have ever had.  every bite was bursting with succulence and the tempura batter <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> extra texture and flavor.  heavenly.  anyone who is a fan of uni and/or tempura needs to try this!  it also comes with tempura shiitake mushroom (luxuriously juicy), tempura shiso leaf (so crispy, so light), and one other <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark> that i forget but that my mom thought was delicious.\n\nthe dessert was lovely too--we had the <mark>Bento Box</mark> which consists of flourless chocolate cake and homemade green tea <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark>.  not too sweet and the perfect way to end a perfect meal.\n\ni seriously cannot wait to come back here again and try the <mark>Hamachi Kama</mark>, the snapper, the whole fried fish, and the squid salad.  is it expensive?  yes.  but is it worth it?  most definitely.", 
            "this is my second time here and both times i've come with my cousin. as much i love nobu, i only go there with her, since she loves it so much, but i never regret it. \n\nthe nice thing is i just let her order, since she knows what's good, but then if i ever go alone, i won't really know what to order. i did have a nice acai cocktail to start the night. it was delicious and refreshing, great way to start the meal. \n\nwe ordered the <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> which i loved since i love the spice. then we had the seafood spring rolls which weren't on the menu, but since they go there all the time, they knew about it. those were also really good, along with the <mark><mark>Nobu's Moriawase Sashimi Salad</mark></mark>. loved the dressing and there was so much sashimi! we also had the rock <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark>, which was kinda like popcorn shrimp, but really tasty <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> grilled beef thing. \n\nat the end, we ordered the <mark>Bento Box</mark>, which was a flourless chocolate cake with green tea <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark>. everything was really good, but service was a little slow. my other friends were also there and they were a party of 10. they started a little after us but finished before us!! other than that though, it was a great night.", 
            "went here on a saturday night. we got there at 10:30pm and it was still packed. we ordered the yellowtail sashimi w/ jalapeno, very good. followed by the <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark> roll and <mark><mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark></mark>, both were good. i wouldn't say anything spectacular but good nevertheless. the best for last, the <mark>Black Cod Miso</mark> lettuce wrap was very good. it's sweet, buttery, hot & cold, soft & crunchy. the dish was the highlight of the evening. the gf enjoyed the miso immensely. we also had the <mark>Bento Box</mark> dessert, simple but good. service was good to us.\n\nbeing nobu, you pay a pretty penny for a small amount of food. ok...you'll drop a few bills here. but it's worth going to, esp. if you never been.", 
            "it was saturday night in vegas, we wanted sushi, and nobu didnt even cross my mind until my boyfriend made reservations for the same night. i quickly logged on to yelp to check the latest reviews as i do with any restaurant, and i am happy to say that i am ecstatic i did this, because had i not, i would have missed out on the black cod <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark>.... which is without a doubt, one the best things that i have ever tasted. \n\nmy bf and i shared 4 dishes and 1 dessert, washed it down with 2 sapporo's each, and by the time we were done, we could barely walk!\n\n<mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> - delicious!!!! the sauce may be just a bit overpowering but delicious nonetheless. i couldnt even taste the jalapeno :)\n\n<mark><mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark></mark> - i have no clue why they are calling this \"ceviche\" but i wish we would have ordered something else instead. it was merely ok,  it just kind of tasted like cold <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> lettuce - but hey, i love <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark>  its all good :)\n\nblack cod <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark> - omg - i just got goosebumps thinking about this dish. it is hands down the best thing i have ever put in my mouth. i like how crunchy <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> it is..  delicioso~\n\n<mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark> roll - your basic roll ..  \n\n<mark>Bento Box</mark> dessert ( flourless chocolate cake with green tea <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark>) yum yum yum yum - this is a great combination - not too much,  shared <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> special is a perfect way to satisfy your sweet tooth.\n\nwill definitely come back - loved the all male service - everyone was really nice and our waiter pretty much gave us his thoughts on all the menu items and gave us some nice suggestions - that in hindsight, i should have taken.\n\n but hey, theyre's always next time!!", 
            "i've been to nobu in vegas twice before and in nyc once and always loved it, so, naturally, when in vegas with a friend, we made a reservation for dinner.  my friend is a big nobu fan as well, and we were both disappointed with our experience this trip to vegas.  what was great about the service - that they brought the dish, explained it and then left us alone to enjoy food w/o constantly checking in w/ us - also turned out to be an issue.  when we were ready to order more sake, we waited over 15 minutes, and, when no server had come to our table, my friend got up and found one to take our order.\n\nthe food this time was also a disappointment.  the rock <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark> wasn't as tastey as always, and the sushi rolls were just ordinary.  certainly not good enough for nobu prices.  the miso cod and yellow tail sashimi were both delicious, but the others were sub-par for nobu's reputation.\n\nsometimes, i'm not sure it's a good thing to have all the big name restaurants in vegas... if the big name chefs are elsewhere, the vegas fare seems to suffer.", 
            "i only had the sushi so i can't review the hot dishes, so here it goes. the <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> and yuzu was by far the best and the <mark>Nobu Crispy Rice with Big Eye Tuna</mark> <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark> shrimp were good as well, but not worth twice the price of a decent sushi place. i don't know what exactly i was expecting, but this definitely fell short.\n\nalthough the cucumber lychee martini was delicious. i would come back to try the hot dishes if someone else was picking up the tab, otherwise i think pink taco would probably be just as satisfying.\n\noh and i really wasn't that impressed with the decor, why is bamboo so luxe?",

            "my first visit to a nobu outpost was about 5 years ago at nobu next door in new york city.  at that point i was still evolving into the foodie that i am today, and for some reason, i absolutely loved the hot spot.  the food was innovative; the atmosphere was exclusive; and snagging a table was a super-heroic feat.  in the years that have passed since, nobu has expanded, and i have also eaten at their nobu 57 in manhattan and the vegas location.  as food culture and my passion for it have evolved, so has my dislike of nobu.  this chain has lost its unique luster, and the quality of the dishes has become a mixed bag.  while some hot and cold courses are better than others, almost anything beats their sushi, which tastes like something ordered from a supermarket's counter.  \n\nmy sushi-fanatic friend and i recently booked a trip to vegas, and her sister had insisted that she try nobu.  i knew that my friend was focused on it, so i went along with the recommendation, though i knew better.  we wound up heading there on our first evening, which at least paved the way for better and better meals as the vacation progressed.\n\nour reservation enabled us to get a table at the crowded spot, and we were immediately seated at a prime location in the center of the dining room.  my friend ordered a glass of sangria, while i opted for a fruity martini, which was so horrifically sweet that i needed to exchange it for a basic glass of sauvignon blanc.  the wine also turned out to be very acidic and not at all similar to the waiter's description.\n\nin terms of the food, we started with two appetizers.  a tiny mound of cool, fresh salmon tartare was immersed in a small bowl of fragrant miso oil and topped with a generous helping of salty caviar.  i am very picky about my tartare, judging it by the amount or lack of flavor it exudes.  this particular version was surprisingly well-seasoned and delicious.  we also sampled one of my favorites - the rock <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark> with spicy sauce.  the succulent fried balls of rock shrimp melted in our mouths, and the spicy mayo sauce <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> a creamy kick. \n\nmy friend stayed firm on our ordering sushi, so we requested the fusion-style <mark>House Special</mark> roll and the <mark>Spicy Scallop</mark> roll.  the <mark>Spicy Scallop</mark> one was pretty flavorful, but their house blend, which included several kinds of fish, had zero taste.  we actually sent it back and did not even bother to order a replacement.\n\nunfor<mark>Tuna (Big Eye)</mark>, i think this restaurant has lost its pizazz, and my friend was not impressed either.  i would really only recommend it for its non-sushi menu items, but even those are inconsistent.", 
            "i spent a week in las vegas at the hard rock hotel for nye this year. it was not my first visit to nobu, so we were very much looking forward to a meal there.\n\nas always, it was fantastic. the cucumber martini was so very refreshing i am still craving it. the yellow tail <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> has the best citrus soy sauce - we actually came back & got a drink & this dish again before we went out another night because it was so good & light. we also had the <mark>Lobster <mark>Tuna <mark>King Crab <mark>Vegetable <mark>Salmon Nobu Style Taco</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark> which were great.\n\nfor hot dishes, we had the rock <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark> <mark>King Crab with Amazu Ponzu</mark> sauce and the black cod <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark>. can you say melt in your mouth? this is the reason i return to nobu again & again.",

            "my buddy and i went to nobu this past friday night at 9:30 for their omasake chef choice tasting menu. we had very few disappointments. they sat us right away at the bar, tables would have been 15 minutes even with our reservations.  lots of good energy in the restaurant, lots of japanese yelling back and forth from the waiters and sushi chefs.  we split a $50 bottle of nonfiltered very fragrant nigori sake cold which was smooth and easy to drink. the small bits of rice at the bottle of the bottle reminded me of red wine sediment as a good thing. \n\nthe first course came out quick and cold. a chilled patty of toro tartar in a soy wasabi sauce topped <mark>Yellowtail or Salmon <mark>Blue Fin <mark>Toro Tartare</mark> with Royal Ossetra Caviar</mark></mark>, served with a baby silver spoon.  it was tender, smooth, rich and melt in your mouth.  the caviar was not memorable.  an a+ start and an expensive dish on their regular menu. next was 4 pieces per plate of thin cut fresh octopus topped with a cilantro leaf, a dot of super hot sauce, finished with citrus, like ceviche.  pretty good.  next was another cold appetizer of rice paper wrapped greens with a piece of raw ebi sweet shrimp, dressed with a fantastic sesame ginger sauce with a fried prawn head on the side.  my buddy especially liked the tempura batter on the <mark>Sweet Shrimp with Fried Head</mark> and the dressing.  i will personally come to your house and kill you if you do not eat the fried prawn head. \n\nthen started the hot plates.  first was the ever famous <mark>Black Cod Miso</mark> cod, a bit too sweet for my buddy but it did not keep us from both licking the plates.  a small piece of tender fish which just went on and on and kept melting in our mouths.  flavor of fish hard to come through past miso and sweetness.  like fish candy in a good way.  my friend said that an improvement would be to torch and crisp up the skin before putting on the sauce which would give some texture contrast and make the dish over the top.  $23 on the regular menu.  next was the beef tenderloin toban yaki style with a shitake and enokitake mushrooms and a piece of thin asparagus in a soy broth. beef very lean, not as melt in your mouth as i would like.  my buddy would have liked a nice piece of ribeye cap instead but who wouldn't.  the dish is served spitting hot on a mini hot plate and when they raise the cover in front of you, the steam envelopes you warmly.  try not to get the grease on you. \n\nnext was the nigiri sushi course of 5 pieces along with a nice clam <mark><mark>Lobster <mark>Miso Soup</mark></mark></mark>. we got a piece of <mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> (mmmm), magura tuna (so tender), yellowtail (yum), clam (a bit tough) and <mark>Sea Eel</mark> which was the most tender fall apart <mark>Sea Eel</mark> i have ever tasted.  the sushi rice <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> fill you to the gills by that point and then they hit you with the dessert which was a bento presentation of a warm flowerless chocolate lava cake with lots of lava and very little cake and a very good not sweet green tea <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark>.   this just put the nail in the coffin.  we were stuffed, but we couldn't stop eating since it was so good.  \n\nthe restaurant closed at 11pm on a friday night, but we will remember the meal for a long time coming.  next time i'm in vegas i plan to make it a point to return and see what the chef choice is at that point in time.  this was the $100 omasake.  the $150 would have <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> some kobe beef and <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> and there.  we were very happy with our choice.  i think the meal was an absolute bargain for the price.", 
            "i went here with a group of girls and was really excited since i have wanted to go for a long time. the atmosphere is really great -- very zen-like. i don't eat sushi, but there were plenty of other options for me. i had the shrimp and maine <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Whole <mark>1/2 Maine Lobster</mark></mark> <mark>Roasted Poussin with Spicy Lemon</mark></mark> sauce. overall great flavor although some pieces of the <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> just a tad rubbery (which is why i dinged my review one star). i must have been really hungry that night, because i wasn't full after my main course. so it was tempura to the rescue -- shrimp, asparagus and sweet potato. that helped tremendously. i do think the service could have been a bit quicker for our drinks, which seemed to not arrive as they should have. the waitstaff otherwise was friendly and attentive.",

            "bluf...the dining highlight of my trip to vegas with my girlfriend was our dinner at nobu.  this was my third trip to nobu, each time having had the chef's omakase tasting menu.  nobu's tasting menu is a thoughtfully composed meal served kaiseki-style (sort of a themed meal) that seeks to tie together individual dishes by attributes like taste, texture, and temperature to enhance the overall experience of the meal.  since there isn't a set menu, you select the price point you're willing to pay and the chef and the kitchen staff prepares an appropriate amount of courses using whatever exotic ingredients they deem fit.  we both received 9 courses with sake pairing. \n\nfirst course:  we started with a kumamoto oyster wrapped in <mark>Smoked Salmon</mark> topped with a osetra caviar, served on an endive leaf in an asparagus \"boat\" with accompanied by sweet <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> miso sauces.  a masterful start!  the 5 basic tastes were tastefully and elegantly captured together in a single dish! \n\nsecond course:  shima-aji sashimi served in a tosazu (vinegared sardines) gel\\u00e9e with micro celery and \"sea grapes\" kelp...garnished with pickled turnip.  a great all-around dish, but the pickle turnip was the ingredient that put it over the top!\n\nthird course:  bluefin tuna sashimi topped <mark>Squid 'Pasta' with Light Garlic</mark> pur\\u00e9e and sliced serrano chilies with jalape\\u00f1o emulsion over brown rice salsa.  i love sashimi, but the garlicky goodness and spiciness from the chilies was amazing.  the brown rice salsa was damn tasty in its own right!\n\nfourth course:  <mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> and seared sweet shrimp <mark><mark>Nobu's Moriawase Sashimi Salad</mark></mark> served with m\\u00e2che, peppercorn, <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Whole <mark>1/2 Maine Lobster</mark></mark> <mark>Roasted Poussin with Spicy Lemon</mark></mark> dressing.   another success!  the peppercorns gave it the spicy notes that greatly accented the raw fish.\n\nintermezzo:  a <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark>...a simple yet refreshing palate cleanser that marked the transition from cold dishes to hot.\n\nfifth course:  pan-seared seabass, seasonal mushrooms, and wild ramps served in a <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> sauce.  as much as i loved the seabass, the earthy mushrooms and ramps nearly stole the show in this dish!\n\nsixth course:  grilled wagyu beef with seared <mark>Teppan Style Foie Gras</mark> served over yellow sweet corn and snap peas <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark>-mirin reduction.  the oh-so-tender australian-raised wagyu beef paired nicely with the perfectly seared <mark>Teppan Style Foie Gras</mark>.  \n\nseventh course:  dashi <mark>Inaniwa Pasta with Lobster</mark> and enoki mushroom with japanese greens.  so simple, yet such an incredibly satisfying dish!  they didn't skimp on the lobster, either.  in many ways, this was my favorite dish of the night.\n\neighth course:  a selection of sushi...otoro (fatty tuna), tasmanian sea trout, <mark>Sea Eel</mark>, a fish i can't recall, mirugai (geoduck), and tamago (egg omelet).  i love sushi.  i loved all of these nigiri!\n\nninth course:  shiso (?) panna cotta with strawberry \"caviar\", an understated but very satisfying closer to our meal.  the \"caviar\" was made to resemble ikura or salmon roe and was a very nice, creative touch.\n\nas for our sake, chris (i think that was his name), our lead server, informed us that nobu imports its sake from japan and that it's made especially for nobu.  i'm not an expert, at all, on the finer aspects of sake.  suffice it to say, our pairings were very nice, with subtle, yet interesting differences between each glass and went well with each dish.  chris did a great job all-around job taking care of us.  we had a very leisurely meal, never feeling rushed, but we never had to wait for our next course or glass of sake.  the timing was impeccable!\n\ni'm really not the type of person to toss out superlatives casually, but our meal was arguably one of the best meals i've ever had...at least since i've started yelping!  each dish was memorable and no single dish clearly stood out as the best since they were all outstanding!  it takes a lot of hair-splitting to even pick a dish that was less satisfying that the rest but if i had to pick one, it was the wagyu and <mark>Teppan Style Foie Gras</mark> course...and that was only due to the impression that the accompaniments on other dishes were more exciting than the sweet corn and snap peas.  if you're in vegas for one night and can only eat at one place while you're there, go to nobu and have the omakase tasting menu!  you won't regret it!",

            "this is the only restaurant that i would recommend at the hard rock hotel. i was working at the hrh for five days and ended up eating at almost every establishment there. nobu is the only one that i would optionally go to again.\n\nthis is the best sushi i've had. everything was flavorful and top quality. i can't remember all the dishes i had, but below are the ones i can remember (score out of 5):\n\n-bug <mark>Nobu Crispy Rice with Big Eye Tuna</mark> lotus chips 4\n-<mark>Shishito Peppers</mark> 2 (i got a really spicy one!)\n-<mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> 4\n-rock <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark> with creamy spicy sauce 4 (butter ponzu sauce 3)\n-rice cubes <mark>Nobu Crispy Rice with Big Eye Tuna</mark> spread 3\n-sushi roll with 4 types of fish 5\n-<mark>Black Cod Miso</mark> 10 you must get this, it is sooooo good!\n-horchata flan 3\n\ni would go just for the <mark>Black Cod Miso</mark>!\n\nthe food is great, but the service was lacking. when we sat down we were a group of 5 and a 6th person joined us. when the waiter brought the tuna lotus chips out he said there are only 5 since that's how many you were when you sat down. he easily could have said i'll bring you another, but i had to specifically ask him. for the price, service should be better, maybe because it's still in the hard rock.", 
            "perfection. i love sushi and have been to several nobu restaurants (both new york locations, san diego, bahamas, los angeles) and this place is my favorite. i've been to this nobu over 10 times and look forward to returning. \n\nthe food at any nobu is consistently out of this world but what makes this location my favorite is the staff. not only can each staff member be a model but everyone on staff is attentive, efficient, and interesting. \n\nthings to order:\n- yellowtail jalepeno sashimi\n- butter lettuce cod\n- <mark>White Fish <mark>Scallop <mark>Salmon <mark>Oyster <mark>Beef <mark>Yuba Sashimi New Style</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark> toro sashimi\n- negi toro hand roll \n- kobe sashimi with hot rocks\n- rock <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark>\n- <mark>Soft Shell Crab</mark> special \n- <mark>Artichoke Salad</mark> (without noodles)\n- yk35 sake\n- peach bellini\n- japanese whiskey flight \n- coconut-lime sake\n- <mark>Bento Box</mark>\n\nlast time we were in we had andrew as our server. super great guy. he gave us some excellent recommendations and was very friendly and professional. i'm going to request to sit in andrew's section every time i go back. \n\nof course i wish nobu wasn't so expensive but i still think it's well worth every penny.", 
            "so- we utilized a tasting menu purchase from groupon, and my biggest fear was that it was not going to be enough food...far from it! the dishes are all good-sized portions (frankly, more food than myself and my boyfriend would normally eat) and everything was delicious! some, more than others- the actual sushi roll was a little forgettable, but the following were amazing: yellowtail sashimi with jalape\\u00f1o, rock <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark> with creamy spicy sauce, black cod <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark>. also, the desert was delicious. \n\ni would recommend, however pricing is not for the faint of heart. it is pricey- but, i think anyone attending this establishment should know that.", 
            "this is a review of the groupon deal dinner.\n\nthe skinny: fusion peruvian japanese dishes left me unimpressed (3) service: excellent service despite the disappointing cuisine (5) value: for the groupon, it is still overpriced for what it is. so you can imagine what i have to say about full price ... not worth it (2.5).\n\nso here's the deal. we spotted the nobu groupon for $95/2 person (regularly $150) prix fixe menu and we thought \"how can we pass this up?\".\n\nwe went and were seated prompty. our server was great at giving us time and space to make some decisions on the menu. we ended up getting in <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> to the prix fixe an order of their <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark> to round out the menu. the specials that they offered didn't really appeal - there was a lot of fruit/candied nuts mixed in with sashimi which sounded overly sweet to me so i passed on those.\n\nstarting <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> simple edamame with maldon sea salt (love those flakes!), it was a nice way to start a meal.\n\ncourse 1) <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark>/cilantro (6 slices): this was a good dish but not exceptional. although i have had different versions of this before, this is one of the better renditions given the quality of the fish and the strategically correct amount of heat. my only thing with this dish was the actual slices of sashimi itself - the slices were a bit thin and ragged along the edges which surprised me given the supposed caliber of this place.\n\ncourse 2) selection of nigri (6 pcs) and a california roll (6 pcs): the nigri was okay - the slices of fish were decent sized. i was despondent when i realized that the sushi rice was a little too overcooked and sticky.\n\ncourse 3) rock <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark>: the first bite was good however as we ate, the spicy aioli began to slowly permeate the batter leading to a soggier batter. i think it aioli would have been better served as a dipping sauce rather than dressed on the tempura to retain textural integrity. flavorwise, this was a nice dish and we loved the mixture of chive and togarashi.\n\ncourse 4) miso glazed black cod: candied black cod more like it! overly sweet, the piece of fish was smothered in the sugary sauce which became more unappetizing the more we worked to finish this. i have made this at home using his recipe with 1/2 the sugar and it is much better.\n\ncourse 5) <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark> (<mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> to the groupon): the tempura was okay nothing special. the batter was slightly spongier than what i like. i think it would have been better if the shredded daikon/ginger was provided to us so we could <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> much/little we wanted.\n\ncourse 6) normally this would be <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark> except it was my birthday so i got a molten cake with a tiramisu and green tea <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark>. all of them were very good however there was nothing that really wow'ed me to think that it was exceptional.\n\nperhaps 10 years ago, the level of this fusion cuisine would be considered cutting edge. however time has made his dishes appear quite dated. the signature dishes of rock <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark>/yellowtail jalape\\u00f1o sashimi/miso glazed black cod are easily found elsewhere - one might argue that this location's rendition is rather lackluster considering the price. given the many issues with the dishes mentioned above, i cannot recommend this place given the groupon price let alone full price. although our server was truly exceptional, that doesn't make up for the food. 2.5 rounded up to 3 starred review.", 
            "the absolute best experience ever. had the groupon - filled us up completely and blew our minds with every dish. the service is outstanding and we were in and out in an hour. had edamame to start - a good primer. then yellowtail sashimi with jalape\\u00f1os and a special soy sauce - oh my goodness my favorite dish. i don't even like sashimi. then a huge california roll and tons of nigri - best i've ever had. then this crazy <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark> with the greatest sauce ever over a bed of lettuce with my best - tasting dressing that complimented it so well - like fireworks in your mouth. very filling. then this fish. alaskan cod. i thought there was a party in my mouth - cooked absolutely perfectly it melted in your mouth and left you feeling completely satisfied. dessert was insane. you just have to experience it.", 
            "my sister and i planned out our trip to vegas to include a dinner at nobu. maybe my tastes are horrible and i'm missing out on some great dishes, but i found our dining experience to be a-ok.\n\nthe service was great; the staff is very knowledgeable about the menu. of course, the prices are up there--not complaining about that part. but in all honesty, i really didn't taste a different in the quality of fish used in my sushi compared to the less than $10 rolls i eat here in az. same goes with the rock <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark> in creamy spicy sauce. at least i can say i've tried it.", 
            "i have been to numerous nobu's across the country and have almost never been disappointed. the nobu at the hard rock get's it right.\nthe service was top notch, they made you feel welcome.\nthe food was typical nobu. it was fantastic.\ntaco are amazing, we always get <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> tuna, they had cerviche tacos which i never seen on a nobu menu, they were great. <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark>, miso cod rock <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark> ,<mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> and there special steak with a truffle sauce.\nwe were not disappointed with any dish.\nthere is a reason that nobu's is my wife's favorite restaurant.\nthey are always consistent.\ni can't wait to back again.", 
            "impromptu trip to vegas for my best friend's birthday! yay! while planning our trip, i noticed a groupon for nobu. i'd been wanting to try out one of the la locations for a while, so this seemed like a win-win. overall, the experience was pretty great. the service was friendly and very attentive (almost too attentive... my ice tea cup was never empty. i don't think they even let it get half empty...)\n\nthe meal started with edamame which wasn't anything special. standard at any japanese place you'd go to. the first course was the yellowtail sashimi with jalepeno. this was so good!! i'm normally not a jalepeno fan, but it had just the right amount of kick to it. this was definitely my favorite dish of the night.\n\nnext up was the rock <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark>. this was alright. i liked the sauce with the lettuce/salad below, but it was too heavy for the shrimp... my friend and i agreed that it just left us craving honey walnut shrimp from panda express. \n\nthird entree up was the <mark>Black Cod Miso</mark>. this was also an outstanding dish, like the yellowtail. the fish was cooked perfectly and the entire dish was both presented well and tasted great. \n\nthe fourth entree (and the reason for docking one star) was california roll and assorted nigiri. maybe it's just because i live in la and i'm spoiled by great sushi, but i wasn't impressed. the fish was fresh enough, but definitely not up to par to say, sugarfish. and at the heart of it all, nobu is a japanese restaurant, so i expected their sushi to be on par with their fusion dishes. sadly, not the case.\n\nthe meal ended with the <mark>Bento Box</mark> dessert, which had flour-less chocolate cake, green tea <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark> <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> cappuccino thing. i'm not a huge dessert person but it was ok. i've never disliked any green tea <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark> i've had and the cappuccino thing was unique. \n\noverall, it was a great meal and good experience. without a doubt, it was worth the price of the groupon. not sure about full price though. i think only the yellowtail sashimi and <mark>Black Cod Miso</mark> would be worth it.", 
            "this review is for the groupon $99 tasting  dinner for two. the food was mediocre. the yellowtail, the rock <mark>Shrimp</mark>, the cod and a small selection of sushi were ok. not what i expect from a nobu restaurant. we had to order other things because the portions were ridiculously small. we ended up paying about $70 more. for the price we paid, it's not worth it because we could of gone to any other \"no-name\" japanese restaurants and got better food for less. the service however was great!", 
            "i had wanted to try nobu for some time, having heard many good things about it. when i saw the $99 groupon plus the 20% off groupon was offering plus my wife's b'day to celebrate there, i knew the stars were aligned.  could it live up to reputation?\nthe food: the groupon is for a 5 course tasting menu. the meal starts with a pass out of edamame with maldon salt. a very generous portion and an excellent way to start a meal. the first course was yellowtail tuna <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> and cilantro. the tuna was sliced super thin and was in a citrus sauce. it was very tasty and different than yellowtail that i have eaten at my local sushi restaurant. things got even better after that. the next dish was rock <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark> with a creamy spicy sauce. wow, was that good! not like any tempura i have eaten before. very lightly breaded, cooked so the shrimp were soft but not mushy. and the spicy sauce was easily handled even by my gringo palate. a great dish. and a huge portion. by its size, the dish would have been enough for dinner if it was the only thing served. this was followed by the alaskan black cod <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark>. another outstanding dish. the fourth course was the sushi; tuna, fluke and salmon with a california roll. this was the weakest part of the menu - only very good. last course, dessert. i photographed the plate. a beautiful presentation with very tasty treats (and a hand written birthday greeting in chocolate). the food rates 5 stars plus.\nthe service: as soon as we were seated, our server, albert, came by to greet us, explain the tasting menu, and take our drink orders. throughout the meal, he, the busboy, and the food runner were very attentive without being overbearing. they made us feel very welcome. our water glasses were never allowed to go below half full. the table was cleared promptly. the food came out of the kitchen plated beautifully. the service was 5 stars plus.\nthe ambiance: the restaurant is nicely decorated with lots of bamboo. however, the tables for 2 were placed one on top of the other. we were there on a monday night, so the tables were never more than 1/3 full.  but our table was about 6 inches from the next table, which was 6 inches from the next in a line up of 4 tables. if the restaurant were crowded and there were people at the next table, we would have been eating with strangers. not my idea of a celebration/romantic meal. at best, 3 stars for ambiance.\nvalue: $80 for dinner of this quality is the deal of the decade. i would do it again in a heartbeat. but i would never go on a weekend night when the table next to me might be occupied (or i would go with a party of 6 or more - the bigger tables were nicely spaced out).", 
            "there's a groupon for nobu?!! whaaaat!?! yes, believe it! i had purchased a groupon for a 5 course tasting menu for $80 for 2 people. and my bf was super excited because he has been wanting to try this place for a while now. it was actually perfect timing that this groupon became available because i was going to be in vegas this weekend. *woot woot!* anyways, i made reservations for 2 at 6pm online and got an e-mail confirmation right away. the groupon can only be used at the nobu inside the hard rock hotel. there's also a nobu inside caeser's palace. once we checked in with the hostesses, we were immediately seated at a nice comfy table and were greeted with a big welcome in japanese! the decor inside was really nice and elegant. i really liked the bamboo wall they had. i also thought it was really cute that we each had a rock on our table used as a chopstick holder. \n\nok onto the food! so we started off <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> edamame with sea salt, which was nothing too special but was good. next came the best sashimi i had ever had in my life! its yellowtail sashimi with a jalapeno slice on top dressed in almost like a ponzu sauce. the flavors went really well together and the yellowtail was fresh and spicy. yumm!!! i can probably eat like five more of that dish. :p the next dish was also another one of their popular dishes: the <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark>. i was really surprised that the shrimp didn't look at all like the usual tempura found at japanese restaurants. the dish almost looked like honey walnut shrimp actually but tasted ten times better. it was rich and creamy. and the sauce it was covered in was deliscious. next came their black cod dish. my bf absolutely loved this one and i can see why. it was so flakey and cooked to perfection. the fish melted in our mouths like butter and it was sweet and savory. next came a plate of sushi, which consisted of a califonia roll and 6 pieces of sashimi sushi. this dish was nothing too fancy and didn't stand out too much. but it was still tasty. and lastly we got our dessert! it was such a cute looking dessert, which composed of a green tea ice-cream, a flourless chocolate cake, and a cuppacino cup. omg...so good!!! the green tea ice-cream is made in house and  after one bite and you definetely know it's green tea ice-cream. the cuppacino cup was probably my favorite out of the other 2 <mark>Dessert</mark> because it was so beautifully crafted and tasted heavenly. the chocolate cake was very fluffy and not too sweet. overall, everything we tried was excellent! the reason why i subtracted 1 star was because both my bf and i felt that the cod and the shrimp was slightly on the saltier side and all of the dishes are pretty small plates to share between 2 people. otherwise, customer service here was superb and our server was just so friendly and informative on the dishes we were trying. i'm so happy to get to try nobu for the first time! =) so go get your groupon, while it's still available peeps!!", 
            "absolutely terrific!  food is always consistent and service is terrific. if there is one knock, it's the atmosphere. tables are a bit squished together and narrow for 2. signature dishes jalape\\u00f1o yellowtail, miso salmon <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark> shrimp are musts!", 
            "impeccable comes to mind when i look back at dinner last night. just wow! \nwe started with <mark>Shishito Peppers</mark> and an amazing tuna <mark><mark>Nobu's Moriawase Sashimi Salad</mark></mark>, moved on to a squid and vegetable dish/casserole that was out of this world followed by miso blackened cod that was absolutely mouth watering.  then came some of the best sushi! yellowtail with scallion roll, yellowtail with jalape\\u00f1o roll, <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark> roll. the wine was a lovely napa chardonnay. \nthe ambiance of this restaurant is calming and the service is excellent! \njapanese restaurants are plentiful in this town so an outstanding stand out restaurant in this category means a lot: this restaurant is outstanding and stands on its own!\nthe prices are very reasonable. not at all overpriced. highly recommended. i am definitely going back!"

            "bluf...the dining highlight of my trip to vegas with my girlfriend was our dinner at nobu.  this was my third trip to nobu, each time having had the chef's omakase tasting menu.  nobu's tasting menu is a thoughtfully composed meal served kaiseki-style (sort of a themed meal) that seeks to tie together individual dishes by attributes like taste, texture, and temperature to enhance the overall experience of the meal.  since there isn't a set menu, you select the price point you're willing to pay and the chef and the kitchen staff prepares an appropriate amount of courses using whatever exotic ingredients they deem fit.  we both received 9 courses with sake pairing. \n\nfirst course:  we started with a kumamoto oyster wrapped in <mark>Smoked Salmon</mark> topped with a osetra caviar, served on an endive leaf in an asparagus \"boat\" with accompanied by sweet <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> miso sauces.  a masterful start!  the 5 basic tastes were tastefully and elegantly captured together in a single dish! \n\nsecond course:  shima-aji sashimi served in a tosazu (vinegared sardines) gel\\u00e9e with micro celery and \"sea grapes\" kelp...garnished with pickled turnip.  a great all-around dish, but the pickle turnip was the ingredient that put it over the top!\n\nthird course:  bluefin tuna sashimi topped <mark>Squid 'Pasta' with Light Garlic</mark> pur\\u00e9e and sliced serrano chilies with jalape\\u00f1o emulsion over brown rice salsa.  i love sashimi, but the garlicky goodness and spiciness from the chilies was amazing.  the brown rice salsa was damn tasty in its own right!\n\nfourth course:  <mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> and seared sweet shrimp <mark><mark>Nobu's Moriawase Sashimi Salad</mark></mark> served with m\\u00e2che, peppercorn, <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Whole <mark>1/2 Maine Lobster</mark></mark> <mark>Roasted Poussin with Spicy Lemon</mark></mark> dressing.   another success!  the peppercorns gave it the spicy notes that greatly accented the raw fish.\n\nintermezzo:  a <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark>...a simple yet refreshing palate cleanser that marked the transition from cold dishes to hot.\n\nfifth course:  pan-seared seabass, seasonal mushrooms, and wild ramps served in a <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> sauce.  as much as i loved the seabass, the earthy mushrooms and ramps nearly stole the show in this dish!\n\nsixth course:  grilled wagyu beef with seared <mark>Teppan Style Foie Gras</mark> served over yellow sweet corn and snap peas <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark>-mirin reduction.  the oh-so-tender australian-raised wagyu beef paired nicely with the perfectly seared <mark>Teppan Style Foie Gras</mark>.  \n\nseventh course:  dashi <mark>Inaniwa Pasta with Lobster</mark> and enoki mushroom with japanese greens.  so simple, yet such an incredibly satisfying dish!  they didn't skimp on the lobster, either.  in many ways, this was my favorite dish of the night.\n\neighth course:  a selection of sushi...otoro (fatty tuna), tasmanian sea trout, <mark>Sea Eel</mark>, a fish i can't recall, mirugai (geoduck), and tamago (egg omelet).  i love sushi.  i loved all of these nigiri!\n\nninth course:  shiso (?) panna cotta with strawberry \"caviar\", an understated but very satisfying closer to our meal.  the \"caviar\" was made to resemble ikura or salmon roe and was a very nice, creative touch.\n\nas for our sake, chris (i think that was his name), our lead server, informed us that nobu imports its sake from japan and that it's made especially for nobu.  i'm not an expert, at all, on the finer aspects of sake.  suffice it to say, our pairings were very nice, with subtle, yet interesting differences between each glass and went well with each dish.  chris did a great job all-around job taking care of us.  we had a very leisurely meal, never feeling rushed, but we never had to wait for our next course or glass of sake.  the timing was impeccable!\n\ni'm really not the type of person to toss out superlatives casually, but our meal was arguably one of the best meals i've ever had...at least since i've started yelping!  each dish was memorable and no single dish clearly stood out as the best since they were all outstanding!  it takes a lot of hair-splitting to even pick a dish that was less satisfying that the rest but if i had to pick one, it was the wagyu and <mark>Teppan Style Foie Gras</mark> course...and that was only due to the impression that the accompaniments on other dishes were more exciting than the sweet corn and snap peas.  if you're in vegas for one night and can only eat at one place while you're there, go to nobu and have the omakase tasting menu!  you won't regret it!", 
            "nirvana - pure nirvana. my taste buds were happy, i was very happy. \n\nmy bf too me here (my first trip) for our saturday night dinner. we knew when we walked in that we were having the omakase. i truly cannot pick out one single dish that i liked over the others - every single one was executed perfectly. our waiter was kind enough to write down what we had so we could remember. though he didn't write down the sake pairings we had - every single one of them matched perfectly with the dish. my only sadness with the sake is that i can't buy it anywhere since it is made for nobu (perhaps time to sale it at the restaurant???) \n\ncourse 1: kumomoto oysters, wrapped in <mark>Smoked Salmon</mark> with osetra caviar, served with endive <mark>Tuna (Big Eye) and Asparagus</mark> in sweet and spicy miso sauces (sweet and spicy? oysters? what is not to love?) \n\ncourse 2: <mark>Shima Aji</mark> sashimi served in tosazu gelee with micro celery and sea grapes kelp; garnished with pickled turnip (i'm not normally a turnip fan, but you could serve this to me anytime!) \n\ncourse 3: bluefin tuna sashimi topped <mark>Squid 'Pasta' with Light Garlic</mark> puree and sliced jalapeno, served <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> emulsion over brown rice salsa (okay a truly unique dish - and it was spicy! you know i like spice in my life!) \n\ncourse 4: <mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> trout and seared sweet shrimp <mark><mark>Nobu's Moriawase Sashimi Salad</mark></mark> served with mache, peppercorn, <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Whole <mark>1/2 Maine Lobster</mark></mark> <mark>Roasted Poussin with Spicy Lemon</mark></mark> dressing. (this fish was so succulent, buttery and full of flavor - if only i could find this in dc) \n\ncourse 5: pan seared seagrass, seasonal mushrooms, wild ramps, served in <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> sauce \n\ncourse 6: grilled washu beef with eared <mark>Teppan Style Foie Gras</mark>, served over yellow sweet corn and snap peas <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark>-mirin reduction \n\ncourse 7: soup with huge chunks of lobster (yup - huge); loved the little enoki mushrooms in it! \n\ncourse 8: sushi: one standout for me - salt <mark>Fresh Water Eel</mark> with this leaf that kinda tasted like basil <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Whole <mark>1/2 Maine Lobster</mark></mark> <mark>Roasted Poussin with Spicy Lemon</mark></mark> together. wow - yummy (this from the girl who wouldn't eat eel for a long time). not that the other offerings weren't good. \n\ncourse 9: dessert. panna cotta (i think) with strawberry caviar - the caviar was awesome! \n\nfinal: three types of fruit sake. my favorite was the ginger. \n\ni have to say this was one of the highlights of our trip. thoroughly enjoyed the meal and would gladly go again and again."

            "nobu would have gotten the 5th star, except for the loud music, and the decidedly non-intimate seating. my wife and i aren't opposed to answering a question about a dish, but when the folks next to you can lean over and check out what you're eating, well...i understand that that's the place's image, but it just keeps it from being a 5-star dining experience, imo.\n\nwe went on a sunday night at 7:30p. we were seated immediately, and our server brought the drink menus. my wife had the passion mojito, and i stuck with a sapporo because i'm not a huge fan of sake. the drink menu was replaced with the dinner menu, but we were pretty sure we were going to have the omakase.\n\nthere are two basic \"levels\" of omakase...each is composed of a mixture of cold dishes, hot dishes, sushi, and dessert. the lower-priced version ($100) contains more traditional dishes, and the higher priced version ($135) was said to be more \"exotic\". we both opted for the latter. i was trying to listen to the explanation of each dish and then scribble them down, so i likely missed some of the little accompaniments/garnishes. \n\n- kumamoto oyster, on the half-shell, with nobu salsa\n- sweet shrimp (sashimi-style, no rice, and no tempura head)\n- some kind of shellfish sashimi-style (either scallop or clam, i'm leaning towards scallop, based on the texture and the menu offerings)\nall three of these items were served on the same plate, the latter two with, i think, ponzu sauce. the oyster was pretty large, such that i didn't want to pick the shell up and end up wearing some of it. the sweet shrimp was very rich and quite tasty, and what i'm assuming was the scallop was a little firmer than i would expect, but still very good.\n\n- kampachi sashimi with kelp and mushroom \nkampachi is one of my favorite fish, and this did not disappoint. the kelp and mushroom, i think, were kept subtle so as not to overpower the fish...you could actually skip the kelp and mushrooms if you were trying to save room for later. \n\n- new-style unagi (lightly seared) layered with shiitake over a bed of tofu, with uni on the side\nthey have a really good sauce for the uni, because i don't like uni, and this tasted great! :) the unagi was also wonderful when prepared like this, as the meat is very tender, and no powerful marinade.\n\n- toro salad with vegetable spring roll\ni wasn't crazy about the spring roll...i thought it was bland. the toro salad, however, was very good.\n\n- green tea & ume sorbet\ni guess this was a palate cleanser? i wasn't expecting to get something like this in the middle of the meal. after the server brought it out, i told my wife, \"thank you for dining at nobu, please come back soon.\" anyway, it was not overly sweet, and would be fine as a dessert after a big meal.\n\n- broiled snapper over risotto with <mark>Snow Crab</mark> meat, topped with a white truffle chip \nthe hot dishes started with a small chunk of snapper that was done pretty much perfectly, no color, but still very juicy. the risotto was ok, nothing special, but the rice went well with the fish.\n\n- small, sliced, grilled \"kobe\" beef tenderloin with okinawa potatoes served alongside a slice of grilled japanese eggplant topped with a small piece of grilled <mark>Teppan Style Foie Gras</mark>.\ni'm going to commit heresy in a bit...i put kobe in quotes, because i hear a bunch of stories about whether or not kobe is kobe, but this tenderloin was done rare, and the potatoes went nicely with it. great dish. i don't really like eggplant, but this was ok, so they did something right. i'd never had <mark>Teppan Style Foie Gras</mark> before, and, well, meh? there, i said it.\n\n- <mark><mark>Lobster <mark>Miso Soup</mark></mark></mark> with clam\nanother break, like the sorbet. it wasn't bad or anything, but i was getting kinda full, so i almost skipped it. (almost).\n\n- nigiri sampler: oh toro, pink snapper, sardine, <mark>Snow Crab</mark>, <mark>Jumbo Clam</mark>\nthe clam was fresh and crunchy, but the <mark>Snow Crab</mark> was pretty ordinary. this was only the second time i've had sardine nigiri. i like sardine under other circumstances, but for sushi, i think it's just too oily? i couldn't tell the difference between the pink snapper and, say, fresh tai, but it was very firm and tasty. my wife told me the oh toro was awful and that i should consider letting her eat it for me, as she didn't want it to ruin my dinner. i love her very much, but in matters of sushi, she is not to be trusted. :) try the oh toro.\n\n- blancmange (yogurt, in this case) over almond crisp, pomegranate seeds, and assorted frozen berries.\nfull. i almost had to pass on dessert (almost). again, not overly sweet, which is a plus in my book, and the berries and almond crisp combined very well. \n\nthe service was tremendous, as the restaurant has a large waitstaff, so dishes are cleared away promptly, but we were not rushed. our section filled up towards the latter half of the meal, but the staff were able to keep up with no problems.\n\nif you're a fan of this type of japanese food, check it out - it's pricey, but you're in vegas, so live a little!", 
            "the miso cod and <mark>Snow Crab</mark> cooked dishes are to die for .. as well grade a sushi perfection", 
            "had dinner here last night with friends and been here two other times.  everything is always fresh and creative.  once you get past the sticker shock you realize it's vegas and all nice restaurants cost an arm and a leg.  it's an experience though so just go with it.  we had <mark><mark>Lobster <mark>Miso Soup</mark></mark></mark>, beef and <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> tacos, <mark>King Crab Ceviche</mark>, shrimp and <mark>Scallop Tempura</mark>, some <mark>Dessert</mark>, and of course sake.  also, tons of sashimi including yelliowtail, tuna, <mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark>, wild yellowtail, and <mark>Snow Crab</mark>.  all awesome.  the service was great, the place is very nice, and the food is always great and fresh.", 
            "really a 41/2.  back a week later except ate in the bar this time.  had them make a scallop role in soy paper <mark>Yellowtail or Salmon <mark>Blue Fin <mark>Toro Tartare</mark> with Royal Ossetra Caviar</mark></mark> on top, awesome.  also, stuck with sashimi again - yellowtail, <mark>Snow Crab</mark>, japanese halibut, albacore, and octopus.  one tuna nigiri and <mark><mark>Lobster <mark>Miso Soup</mark></mark></mark> too.  had a couple martini's and had a shot of this unbelievable tequila called deleon.  very smooth and unique.  expensive but we were celebrating so very worth it.  service was very good and our server was very helpful and offered other local joints to eat at suggestion wise.  expensive but a great place.", 
            "after our free pitbull concert from one of our work vendors, we were hungry!  for appetizers, we decided to go to the culinary dropout, so for dinner, we decided to go to the next restaurant, nobu.  i've heard amazing things about this place and knew that it was top notch.  heck, i've seen it on keeping up with the kardashians. as good as i know the food would be, i also knew the price tag would be pretty hefty!\n\nwhen we got in, i noticed and array of seating.  chairs, tables, booths, bar, you name it.  the green back splash of the bar really went well with the light colored wood framing around the rest of the restaurant. you felt like you were at a super trending japanese restaurant.  it just felt high end!  our server was nice, but knew we had a bunch to drink.  we put our menu in his hands.  here's what we got (with prices):\n\n-<mark>Kumamoto Oyster with <mark>Bone in Ribeye 24oz Nobu Sauce</mark></mark>  18\n-<mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark>  24\n-<mark>Uni or Oyster Shooter</mark>  12\n-salmon sashimi   24\n-<mark>Mixed Seafood Ceviche</mark>  22\n-<mark>Snow Crab</mark> <mark><mark>Nobu's Moriawase Sashimi Salad</mark></mark>  28\n-tuna (big eye) sushi 12\n-salmon sushi 10\n-yellowtail sushi 12\n\nsome of these items came in a sushi platter.  i wasn't too sure how the platting and combination went.  all i know is the fish was super fresh.  the aesthetics of each plate was like a work of art.  i felt like i was a kardashian! lol.  our total bill for 7 people, came to $780. oh-em-gee!  for a nice, elegant night, to me, this was worth it.  such amazing food and great atmosphere.  i will definitely return!"

            "when nobu opened in new york city, it created a sensation.  reservations were nearly impossible to get, and its new interpretation of traditional japanese food was widely praised.  this led to the inevitable branding of the restaurant; nobu can be found all over the globe.\n\nmeal #1: i found las vegas nobu's sushi highly variable.  the overall quality was ok, but some items (e.g., uni) were poor while others (e.g., ankimo) were good.  orange and honey flavored sake was interesting but probably not worth repeating.\n\n\nmeal #2:  since my first meal, i went to nobu in miami beach, sat in the dining room and had the omakase meal.  i enjoyed that a bit more, so decided to give the vegas location another shot.\n\nthe restaurant looks ok, but nothing great.  it's very noisy, in keeping with the hard rock atmosphere.  the crowd is mostly young, but i think anyone would feel comfortable here; i did.  service is pleasant, although all the servers are running around at full speed.\n\nnow, on to the meal:\n\n    * i chose jyunmai daiginjyo sake.  it wasn't bad, but was a trifle harsh.\n    * small japanese spring roll with balsamic vinaigrette reduction.  good.\n    * trio of raw seafood: sea scallop slice, oyster, ama ebi (raw shrimp).  all served with onion and other spices, although each was slightly different.  good.\n    * seared maguro and a slightly strong flavored fish, <mark>Squid 'Pasta' with Light Garlic</mark> chips and a pickled ginger shoot.  a good combination.  very good.\n    * uni (<mark>Sea Urchin</mark>) <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> white fish, served on sliced eggplant.  the uni was seared and was surprisingly delicious.  there was also a tiny river crab, to be eaten shell and all; interesting for the crunch, not the flavor.  very good.\n    * o toro and a spring roll <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> sauce and radish.  the o toro was good but a little chewy, and the strong sauce tended to overwhelm the tuna.  good to very good.\n    * palate cleanser: intensely flavored, sweet/sour mango sorbet, on top of a red granite with little flavor.\n    * service lapse.  up to this point, courses had been timed well.  at this point, i waited for about 15 minutes, with no explanation.  this was a little annoying.\n    * grilled sea scallop on a bed of mushrooms, bits of seafood, and brown rice.  very good.\n    * <mark>Teppan Style Foie Gras</mark> and kobe beef.  a large hunk of <mark>Teppan Style Foie Gras</mark>; good flavor.  kobe beef very good.  overall, very good to excellent.\n    * service lapse: the next course was supposed to be sushi, followed by <mark><mark>Lobster <mark>Miso Soup</mark></mark></mark>.  they reversed the order, and apologized later.  a minor matter.\n    * <mark><mark>Lobster <mark>Miso Soup</mark></mark></mark>.  better than average; good fish stock flavor, not too salty.  very good.\n    * sushi: o-toro (tuna belly), <mark>Shima Aji</mark> (variety of mackerel?), some kind of crab, unagi (eel).  very good.\n    * fruit papillote.  like a crepe.  the raspberry seeds were very distracting.  fair.\n    * honey <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark>.  very strong honey flavor.  strange, but i liked it.  very good.\n\noverall, the meal was good, but not as good as nobu in miami, and not nearly as good as okada.  at the price they charge ($120), they need to do better.\n\n\nmeal #3: based on past meals, i hadn't planned to return. however, i found myself at the hard rock hotel at meal time, and no other choices looked appealing. i decided to go for unusual choices, hoping this would be a strength. this worked out better. my selections:\n\n    * ankimo (steamed monkfish liver). standard but still very good.\n    * <mark>Hamachi Kama</mark> (grilled yellowtail collar). this is a chunk of fish, skin and bone, served grilled. it may not sound like much, and it's a little difficult to get the flesh out, but it's usually very rich and very tasty. i was both happy and sad with my choice: it was very good, but not as good as elsewhere. if you'd like to try this dish, order it robatayaki style at okada.\n    * live shrimp. these santa barbara shrimp were killed in front of me, so i guess that means they're fresh. they were big and rather chewy; i'm guessing the latter is due to their recent demise. the heads were served tempura style, and were juicy and tasty.\n    * live octopus. i'm not sure that it was live, but slices of the tentacle, served raw, were indeed very fresh tasting - and much less chewy than the cooked version. pretty good.\n\nthis was the most satisfying of my meals at nobu. nothing was stellar, but everything was good.\n\n\n\nnobu's strength is its new take on japanese foods.  its weaknesses are sushi that isn't in the same class with the better places in las vegas, and suspect service.  given such high prices, i'd look elsewhere.", 
            "having owned nobu's cookbook for years, i was only too excited to finally visit a restaurant of his.  (which means my lazy ass never made anything form the cookbook but my excuse is that some of his ingredients are so hard to find....but i digress).\n\ndrinks:\njyunmai sake - \"masu\" size (wooden box cup) smooth and lovely to drink\nyk 35 - \"masu\" size.  this was the most expensive one on their list and boy was it worth every dollar.\nnote: masu is served in an overflowing box-cup on a plate.  you finish your cup and then pour what's on the plate back into your vessel.\n\nfood:\nmonkfish liver - honestly, not my thing.  i tried but just couldn't get over the fish-flavored paste.  it had caviar on top which i ate.  but my husband who loved it said the sweet miso sauce enhanced the whole thing greatly.  he enjoyed having the dish to himself.\ntiradito, nobu style - sashimi with a dab of hot chili sauce and black sea salt and cilantro.  one of my faves but not for hubby\n<mark>White Fish <mark>Scallop <mark>Salmon <mark>Oyster <mark>Beef <mark>Yuba Sashimi New Style</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark> sashimi - sashimi doused <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> sauce and oil, topped with ginger and green onions. also one of my faves but had to share this one with hubby. \nsweet shrimp <mark>White Fish <mark>Scallop <mark>Salmon <mark>Oyster <mark>Beef <mark>Yuba Sashimi New Style</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark> sashimi - even better than the above.  yum.  hubby let me have most of this one and for that, i'm forever grateful.\nuni tempura - this was the one thing i wanted to try the most.  the shiso wrapped around the uni gave it another facet and i greatly enjoyed this dish...on my own.  more for me!  the accompanying shitake mushroom and salts were delicious.\nmiso black cod - i didn't have high hopes but our server recommended it so we went with it.  i was pleasantly surprised.  the serving size was reasonable.  four 2-bite pieces served on butter lettuce and topped with crispy noodle things.  very enjoyable.\n<mark>Scallop</mark> <mark><mark>Whole <mark>1/2 Maine Lobster</mark></mark> with Wasabi Pepper</mark> sauce - again, a pretty good-sized serving. the sauce was phenomenal although i do wish there was more of a wasabi kick.  i'm no wuss about spiciness but the pepper in this kept choking me up.  \n\ndessert:\ncaramel chocolate mouse - i thought this sounded rather ordinary until i looked at the ingredient list.  globe of chocolate filled halfway with mousse (very light and delicate), topped with a toffee disc, topped <mark>Squid with Shiso</mark> citrus granite, topped with caramel \"caviar\"; everything sat on top of a thick coconut sauce, dusting of brown powder sugar and crispy japanese rice.  best dish we had all night.  loved it.  i could have had 3 more.\n\nservice was great with several lapses here and there.  the busboys were impeccable.  our server got less and less attentive with the arrival of his other tables.\n\nthe quality of the food was excellent and did not disappoint.  i'm no stranger to paying several bills for dinner but for whatever reason, i did feel that food was somewhat overpriced here.  or maybe for what we paid, i thought the food should have been 5-star.", 
            "so we had reservations for 930 on a friday night and were seated immediately upon our arrival. the (almost all-male)staff were attentive, informative and friendly. \n\nour meal:\n\n-edamame with shaved seasalt\n-sashimi yellowtail <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark> <mark>Yellowtail and Jalapeno</mark> (yummmmy, bobby's favorite)\n-black cod in lettuce cups with filo flakes (my favorite, so perfect)\n-sashimi <mark>Squid 'Pasta' with Light Garlic</mark> chips (little too salty)\n-salmon sushi\n-toro sushi (very tasty fish)\n-dessert: edamame <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark> atop a brownsugar brownie,caramel sauce, and tiny sliver of decadent brittle...the <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark> scoop was so tiny that we really couldn't taste the edamame. \n\na super treat for sushi, but be prepared to spend money!!", 
            "bluf...the dining highlight of my trip to vegas with my girlfriend was our dinner at nobu.  this was my third trip to nobu, each time having had the chef's omakase tasting menu.  nobu's tasting menu is a thoughtfully composed meal served kaiseki-style (sort of a themed meal) that seeks to tie together individual dishes by attributes like taste, texture, and temperature to enhance the overall experience of the meal.  since there isn't a set menu, you select the price point you're willing to pay and the chef and the kitchen staff prepares an appropriate amount of courses using whatever exotic ingredients they deem fit.  we both received 9 courses with sake pairing. \n\nfirst course:  we started with a kumamoto oyster wrapped in <mark>Smoked Salmon</mark> topped with a osetra caviar, served on an endive leaf in an asparagus \"boat\" with accompanied by sweet <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> miso sauces.  a masterful start!  the 5 basic tastes were tastefully and elegantly captured together in a single dish! \n\nsecond course:  shima-aji sashimi served in a tosazu (vinegared sardines) gel\\u00e9e with micro celery and \"sea grapes\" kelp...garnished with pickled turnip.  a great all-around dish, but the pickle turnip was the ingredient that put it over the top!\n\nthird course:  bluefin tuna sashimi topped <mark>Squid 'Pasta' with Light Garlic</mark> pur\\u00e9e and sliced serrano chilies with jalape\\u00f1o emulsion over brown rice salsa.  i love sashimi, but the garlicky goodness and spiciness from the chilies was amazing.  the brown rice salsa was damn tasty in its own right!\n\nfourth course:  <mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> and seared sweet shrimp <mark><mark>Nobu's Moriawase Sashimi Salad</mark></mark> served with m\\u00e2che, peppercorn, <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Whole <mark>1/2 Maine Lobster</mark></mark> <mark>Roasted Poussin with Spicy Lemon</mark></mark> dressing.   another success!  the peppercorns gave it the spicy notes that greatly accented the raw fish.\n\nintermezzo:  a <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark>...a simple yet refreshing palate cleanser that marked the transition from cold dishes to hot.\n\nfifth course:  pan-seared seabass, seasonal mushrooms, and wild ramps served in a <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> sauce.  as much as i loved the seabass, the earthy mushrooms and ramps nearly stole the show in this dish!\n\nsixth course:  grilled wagyu beef with seared <mark>Teppan Style Foie Gras</mark> served over yellow sweet corn and snap peas <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark>-mirin reduction.  the oh-so-tender australian-raised wagyu beef paired nicely with the perfectly seared <mark>Teppan Style Foie Gras</mark>.  \n\nseventh course:  dashi <mark>Inaniwa Pasta with Lobster</mark> and enoki mushroom with japanese greens.  so simple, yet such an incredibly satisfying dish!  they didn't skimp on the lobster, either.  in many ways, this was my favorite dish of the night.\n\neighth course:  a selection of sushi...otoro (fatty tuna), tasmanian sea trout, <mark>Sea Eel</mark>, a fish i can't recall, mirugai (geoduck), and tamago (egg omelet).  i love sushi.  i loved all of these nigiri!\n\nninth course:  shiso (?) panna cotta with strawberry \"caviar\", an understated but very satisfying closer to our meal.  the \"caviar\" was made to resemble ikura or salmon roe and was a very nice, creative touch.\n\nas for our sake, chris (i think that was his name), our lead server, informed us that nobu imports its sake from japan and that it's made especially for nobu.  i'm not an expert, at all, on the finer aspects of sake.  suffice it to say, our pairings were very nice, with subtle, yet interesting differences between each glass and went well with each dish.  chris did a great job all-around job taking care of us.  we had a very leisurely meal, never feeling rushed, but we never had to wait for our next course or glass of sake.  the timing was impeccable!\n\ni'm really not the type of person to toss out superlatives casually, but our meal was arguably one of the best meals i've ever had...at least since i've started yelping!  each dish was memorable and no single dish clearly stood out as the best since they were all outstanding!  it takes a lot of hair-splitting to even pick a dish that was less satisfying that the rest but if i had to pick one, it was the wagyu and <mark>Teppan Style Foie Gras</mark> course...and that was only due to the impression that the accompaniments on other dishes were more exciting than the sweet corn and snap peas.  if you're in vegas for one night and can only eat at one place while you're there, go to nobu and have the omakase tasting menu!  you won't regret it!", 
            "nirvana - pure nirvana. my taste buds were happy, i was very happy. \n\nmy bf too me here (my first trip) for our saturday night dinner. we knew when we walked in that we were having the omakase. i truly cannot pick out one single dish that i liked over the others - every single one was executed perfectly. our waiter was kind enough to write down what we had so we could remember. though he didn't write down the sake pairings we had - every single one of them matched perfectly with the dish. my only sadness with the sake is that i can't buy it anywhere since it is made for nobu (perhaps time to sale it at the restaurant???) \n\ncourse 1: kumomoto oysters, wrapped in <mark>Smoked Salmon</mark> with osetra caviar, served with endive <mark>Tuna (Big Eye) and Asparagus</mark> in sweet and spicy miso sauces (sweet and spicy? oysters? what is not to love?) \n\ncourse 2: <mark>Shima Aji</mark> sashimi served in tosazu gelee with micro celery and sea grapes kelp; garnished with pickled turnip (i'm not normally a turnip fan, but you could serve this to me anytime!) \n\ncourse 3: bluefin tuna sashimi topped <mark>Squid 'Pasta' with Light Garlic</mark> puree and sliced jalapeno, served <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> emulsion over brown rice salsa (okay a truly unique dish - and it was spicy! you know i like spice in my life!) \n\ncourse 4: <mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> trout and seared sweet shrimp <mark><mark>Nobu's Moriawase Sashimi Salad</mark></mark> served with mache, peppercorn, <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Whole <mark>1/2 Maine Lobster</mark></mark> <mark>Roasted Poussin with Spicy Lemon</mark></mark> dressing. (this fish was so succulent, buttery and full of flavor - if only i could find this in dc) \n\ncourse 5: pan seared seagrass, seasonal mushrooms, wild ramps, served in <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> sauce \n\ncourse 6: grilled washu beef with eared <mark>Teppan Style Foie Gras</mark>, served over yellow sweet corn and snap peas <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark>-mirin reduction \n\ncourse 7: soup with huge chunks of lobster (yup - huge); loved the little enoki mushrooms in it! \n\ncourse 8: sushi: one standout for me - salt <mark>Fresh Water Eel</mark> with this leaf that kinda tasted like basil <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Whole <mark>1/2 Maine Lobster</mark></mark> <mark>Roasted Poussin with Spicy Lemon</mark></mark> together. wow - yummy (this from the girl who wouldn't eat eel for a long time). not that the other offerings weren't good. \n\ncourse 9: dessert. panna cotta (i think) with strawberry caviar - the caviar was awesome! \n\nfinal: three types of fruit sake. my favorite was the ginger. \n\ni have to say this was one of the highlights of our trip. thoroughly enjoyed the meal and would gladly go again and again.", 
            "omg the albacore was amazing, <mark>Squid 'Pasta' with Light Garlic</mark>. we had the famous black cod, very good! salmon ok. yellow tail good. octopus was firm and thick. we had the $35 yellow tail belly seared with jalape\\u00f1o sauce something really good but not worth $$. ohhhh the mochi oh my god guava was super delish!!  will be back for sure. and the service is on point! you pay what you get here for sure."

            "!-!-!a-m-a-z-i-n-g-!-!-!\nok, so first off, i have never been a seafood fan, never mind sushi so this was my second time and it was amazing!!  everything you've heard about nobu is true!  i read the reviews and was down to try it when bf suggested it on our recent vegas trip.\nso we get there and are seated immediately, kudos.  i ordered the champagne 59 or some concoction and bf orders the mango martini-both are very yummay!!  but i think the mango was the better of the two!  \nso, me being a newbie on the sushi scene i was a bit intimidated by the menu and just jumped in and ordered the tuna tempura roll off the cold menu to start off with, really wasn't sure but it proved to be good!!! omg, even bf, who isn't really down <mark>Nobu Crispy Rice with Big Eye Tuna</mark>, was floored.  the tuna had scallions in the middle i believe....whatever it was delish!  and the sauce it had was soooo good, i don't even know what it was, i should've asked.  ok, shit was so good after we ordered the next 2 rolls, we ordered another order of the tuna tempura, and the tempura was so slight, it great crunch to the tiniest degree.\nnext, we ordered the <mark>Soft Shell Crab</mark> roll was again a mystery.  was a very welcome bite to my mouth, i don't know what else was in it but had a crunch also.  the crab was very good, not a hint of the seafoody about it! \nalso on our table was the <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark> roll, i know tempura is a no-no to the sushi elite, but training wheels here kids!  never mind that, this roll was a fave!  i also ordered another plate of this little roll because i loved it so much!  again, tiny bit of the tempura crunch=goodness!  the amazingness of this is too good to put into words......i again don't even know what was in it besides the skrimps but i honestly feel like going there again, like now.  \nso for dessert i ordered this thing described as apple brioche with caramel sauce that comes with a gelato.  it came out and looked like little donut holes!  was so good!  they were covered in sugar and inside was tiny chopped up apples and on the side in a little spoon was the carmel. little bites of <mark>Sweet Shrimp with Fried Head</mark>!  \nas for service-stellar! she was on it when we needed drinks and more sushi, but she kinda lacked when i asked about rolls.  that's ok, i walked out very happy!", 
            "my buddy and i went to nobu this past friday night at 9:30 for their omasake chef choice tasting menu. we had very few disappointments. they sat us right away at the bar, tables would have been 15 minutes even with our reservations.  lots of good energy in the restaurant, lots of japanese yelling back and forth from the waiters and sushi chefs.  we split a $50 bottle of nonfiltered very fragrant nigori sake cold which was smooth and easy to drink. the small bits of rice at the bottle of the bottle reminded me of red wine sediment as a good thing. \n\nthe first course came out quick and cold. a chilled patty of toro tartar in a soy wasabi sauce topped <mark>Yellowtail or Salmon <mark>Blue Fin <mark>Toro Tartare</mark> with Royal Ossetra Caviar</mark></mark>, served with a baby silver spoon.  it was tender, smooth, rich and melt in your mouth.  the caviar was not memorable.  an a+ start and an expensive dish on their regular menu. next was 4 pieces per plate of thin cut fresh octopus topped with a cilantro leaf, a dot of super hot sauce, finished with citrus, like ceviche.  pretty good.  next was another cold appetizer of rice paper wrapped greens with a piece of raw ebi sweet shrimp, dressed with a fantastic sesame ginger sauce with a fried prawn head on the side.  my buddy especially liked the tempura batter on the <mark>Sweet Shrimp with Fried Head</mark> and the dressing.  i will personally come to your house and kill you if you do not eat the fried prawn head. \n\nthen started the hot plates.  first was the ever famous <mark>Black Cod Miso</mark> cod, a bit too sweet for my buddy but it did not keep us from both licking the plates.  a small piece of tender fish which just went on and on and kept melting in our mouths.  flavor of fish hard to come through past miso and sweetness.  like fish candy in a good way.  my friend said that an improvement would be to torch and crisp up the skin before putting on the sauce which would give some texture contrast and make the dish over the top.  $23 on the regular menu.  next was the beef tenderloin toban yaki style with a shitake and enokitake mushrooms and a piece of thin asparagus in a soy broth. beef very lean, not as melt in your mouth as i would like.  my buddy would have liked a nice piece of ribeye cap instead but who wouldn't.  the dish is served spitting hot on a mini hot plate and when they raise the cover in front of you, the steam envelopes you warmly.  try not to get the grease on you. \n\nnext was the nigiri sushi course of 5 pieces along with a nice clam <mark><mark>Lobster <mark>Miso Soup</mark></mark></mark>. we got a piece of <mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> (mmmm), magura tuna (so tender), yellowtail (yum), clam (a bit tough) and <mark>Sea Eel</mark> which was the most tender fall apart <mark>Sea Eel</mark> i have ever tasted.  the sushi rice <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> fill you to the gills by that point and then they hit you with the dessert which was a bento presentation of a warm flowerless chocolate lava cake with lots of lava and very little cake and a very good not sweet green tea <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark>.   this just put the nail in the coffin.  we were stuffed, but we couldn't stop eating since it was so good.  \n\nthe restaurant closed at 11pm on a friday night, but we will remember the meal for a long time coming.  next time i'm in vegas i plan to make it a point to return and see what the chef choice is at that point in time.  this was the $100 omasake.  the $150 would have <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> some kobe beef and <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> and there.  we were very happy with our choice.  i think the meal was an absolute bargain for the price."

            "you really need to be a sushi aficionado to appreciate this desert outpost of the much-hyped and highly-acclaimed manhattan dining spot. the decor is a carbon copy of the nyc original, and there's no denying that the space is a stunning setting for dinner. my friends raved about their raw selections but, just as in tribeca, i was unimpressed by my cooked entree, here a filet of whitefish marinated in garlic, chives, and ginger and seared in hot olive oil. for<mark>Tuna (Big Eye)</mark>, asian pear bread pudding, with ginger <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark> and brandy-infused caramel sauce, ended the evening on a high note. very expensive, so keep your fingers crossed that the cards are kind later in the night.", 
            "sushi heaven, simply put. you will be spoiled by the experience and will scrutinize every sushi restaurant post dining here.\n\nlocated at the hard rock, i was for<mark>Tuna (Big Eye)</mark> enough to grab a spot at the sushi bar and partake in the hustle and bustle of the japanese chefs' banter. being at the bar allows you to receive great recs on unique dishes (i.e. snapper nigiri with special hot sauce, et al).\n\nfor me, what sets nobu apart is the freshness of the fish, and the perfect cut of fish paired with the perfect amount of rice. it's all about getting that balance right.\n\nin regards to vibes, nobu is a place to be seen and the interior supports the asian influence with contemporary.\n\nbe prepared for a long wait if you don't make reservations and remember, there's a premium to be paid for the nobu brand and quality.", 
            "let me start by saying that i am a sushi freak. so you don't have to wonder, \"hmm... maybe it was just her first time or....\" no. i seriously live for sushi. i eat at incredible places about 3-4 times a month! i dont care about cost either. good sushi is worth it to me! \n\nokay, that being said... i would give nobu a 3.5 stars if that were possible. then again, the only reason i'd bring it up by half would be the friendly servers and great decor. \n\nnow, for the sushi... like someone said below recently, i was expecting to be wowed. i've eaten some amazing food in vegas and hoped this was going to blow those other places out of the water. but this was not to be unfor<mark>Tuna (Big Eye)</mark>. now, i don't know if it's because we're more into nigiri & sashimi and we don't go the hot meal route very often. either way, i was just not impressed. we orde<mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> sashimi which came as big slabs of flavorless fish, no presentation & really no taste either. next was spanish mackerel, usually my fave. this too was bland & boring. then i ordered unagi, which as most sushi fans know takes a while to get to you when they bake it fresh. this was brought to me almost before the words came out of my mouth! fast service yes... but how did he bake it so fast? i discovered the answer when i noticed a plateful of it sitting on top of the little oven already done & waiting. boo!! this caused it to be lukewarm when it arrived. finished off with rock <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark> because at this point we really just wanted out of there realizing that if we saved up what money we'd normally spend, that we could go to one of our fave places soon to make up for it! \n\nrock <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark> was good, i can't lie. but it was also nothing special. oh!! <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> that really bugged me & my dining partner was that the chef wasn't very good at making his rice stick together tight! it fell apart the second you touched it. :( \n\nso to sum up...\n\n1 point for service, 1 point for ambiance and 1 point for food/taste.i do have to say the the fish did taste fresh & the quality seemed safe & good. however,  will i go back? ehh... i would if someone else was buying. but i will never seek it out on my own again i'm sad to say.", 
            "my husband and i had dinner here last night.  we had dinner at nobu in nyc years ago and loved it then.  this dinner did not disappoint.  \n\nwe shared the tempura rock shrimp and <mark>Black Cod Miso</mark> cod.  both delicious and i could have easily just have ordered another one of either versus trying something different.  but i had a <mark>Spicy Tuna (Big Eye)</mark> handroll - also very good.  my husband ordered the yellowtail collar - i was not a fan of this as it smelled very fishy but he liked it a lot.  also the edamame was warm with sea salt - never had it this way - very good.  but i am a salt-o-holic :-)\n\nthe service was very good.  our waiter came back enough to check on us without it being intrusive.   i had the champagne 95 cocktail - yum.\n\nit was a sunday night at 9:30pm (and closer to 11pm when we left) and it was crowded so imagine friday and saturday nights get pretty crazy and since its vegas there are a lot of late diners.  definitely recommend a reservation.", 
            "omg, i love nobu. talk about understatement... \n\nlike my experience at bouchon, we had a set menu but i didn't care! it was quite simply amazing!  my favorite: a lettuce wrap cod... it was so delicious. seafood skeptics were even keen on the whole nobu menu! they also had a <mark>Spicy Tuna (Big Eye)</mark> salad that was just impeccable!\n\ndid i already say that i loved nobu???? \n\nplease go... and keep in mind, a jap <mark>Sushi Dinner</mark> is never complete without sake. i only wish i remember the name of the sake i tried... but i'm sure after 10 shots they all tend to taste alike.", 
            "i've heard various friends praise los angeles's nobu over the years, so after my girlfriend ran the las vegas marathon this weekend, we decided to celebrate <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> first-class sushi.\n\nwe had reservations at 9:00 pm, and we were seated promptly (actually ahead of time, which was nice). my first impression of the restaurant was that it was extremely loud (we were there on a tuesday night), and its location in the hard rock hotel made me groan (it's a bit out of the way, and not necessarily a place i want to poke around).\n\nour waiter, justin, was initially very prompt with our drink orders, but it took 10 minutes (and a reminder) to get glasses of water, and another 10 to get <mark><mark>Lobster <mark>Miso Soup</mark></mark></mark>.\n\nour first course was only half right (we got two dishes, but one was not what we ordered). the servers apologized and took it away. at the rate they were bringing out our food, though, we shuddered to think how long it would take them to bring out the correct dish. for<mark>Tuna (Big Eye)</mark>, it was corrected quickly.\n\nwhen our sushi came out, we noticed another mistake: the <mark>Spicy Miso Chips <mark>Nobu Crispy Rice with Big Eye Tuna</mark> or <mark>Scallop</mark></mark> had been mistakenly replaced with a second order of <mark>Spicy Tuna (Big Eye)</mark>. again, we told them it was wrong and again, they corrected the mistake rather quickly.\n\nservice got to be so bad that after asking a server to hail our waiter (and subsequently having the request ignored), we decided to get the manager over to our table. we were 30 seconds from getting up and leaving (she took another 5 minutes to get to the table) when she came over and heard our story. she seemed as interested in our plight as any manager should and agreed to comp some of our dishes, which was nice.\n\nstill, however, justin's service through the entire night was abysmal (i think we saw him 3 times over an hour and a half), and no amount of manager treatment could save the tip.\n\nregarding the food, it was ok. the <mark><mark>Lobster <mark>Miso Soup</mark></mark></mark> was great. the <mark>Spicy Tuna (Big Eye)</mark> and scallop rolls were anything but (very mild), and the hot/cold mixture of the tuna tempura rolls was a little strange. it was good, but the temperature difference was one of those things that made me wonder, \"is this supposed to be this way and i'm an idiot for thinking this, or is something actually wrong with how it was made?\" judging by the fact that the tuna tempura rolls were one of the dishes they got wrong initially, it could have been that they rushed the order and made it worse. either way, i wasn't really in love with it.\n\nfor the price i [would have] paid, i can't say that the las vegas nobu is really worth it for me again. i've had much better sushi in oakland, for much less.", 
            "3 words miso marinated cod!\n\nok so we decided to go to las vegas on my friends birthday during his quater life crisis (there is such a thing).  this was the first restaurant we chose to dine at.\n\nfirst off it's at the hard rock hotel.  i don't like this place one bit.  it's over rated and think nobu doesn't fit in this environment of tacky rock n roll memoriabilia minus nirvana.  \n\nok we go in and get drinks first at the bar.  salty dogs are great and they make it damn good at nobu. \n\nwe get seated 20 minutes later even with reservations, this place gets busy.  our server comes and asks us what we would like to order.  we pretty much had the chef's tasting menu and we're glad we did.\n\nfirst course- <mark>Spicy Tuna (Big Eye)</mark> and i think dragon roll- it was good, but come on i can getthose rolls anywhere, give me something interesting!\n\nsecond course- tempura rock shrimp with spicy aioli <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark> <mark>Vegetable</mark> <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> glaze.  very good and for how simple it looked the sauces made it very complex. \n\nthird course- yellowtail with jalepeno and citrus ponzu- amazing!  so damn good i would have eaten just that and be satisfied.  pepper seared rare ahi with chili vinegar sauce- again give me a plate of this and i would die a happy man.\n\nfourth course- miso marinated cod- this is by far the best seafood dish i have ever tried.  the fish was so tender, and the skin was crisp and flavorful!  simply heaven. \n\nfifth course- trio of sorbets\n\ni must say the food was great minus the first course!  <mark>Spicy Tuna (Big Eye)</mark> and dragon roll at a high end japanese restaurant?  i don't know for a tab of $400.00 for 4 people i think that <mark>Spicy Tuna (Big Eye)</mark> is not needed!", 
            "mmmmmmsashimi: i agree with most of the other reviewers about the sound level but luckily we were seated at a table for two next to the bamboo room divider. the level of service from our waiter was impeccable. he was helpful, engaging, and honest about the pros and cons of the menu. we shared a large bottle of nigori sake and edamame - which was seasoned with this light and feathery-textured sea salt. yum. i was disappointed that they did not have spanish mackerel that night but i consoled myself with the <mark>Sashimi Dinner</mark> plate. the salmon was simply mouthwatering and the tuna was perfect as was the yellowtail, <mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark>, ebi, white fish, mackerel, and squid. david ordered the <mark>Spicy Tuna (Big Eye)</mark> <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark> shrimp rolls and an order of unagi. for dessert i had the banana \"toban yaki\" that had sliced bananas and strawberries simmering in calvados.", 
            "so my co-worker & i thought we were invited to a company dinner at ajs steakhouse but were discretely booted from the party since there were too many accounts to entertain.  my co-worker, we'll call her shirley, put her betting face on and said to herself, \"ok, we'll see your ajs and raise you a nobu\" and off we went to plan b.\n\nwe arrived at nobu during a bustling dinner hour but were promptly seated at a table sans reservations, btw, shirley was looking hot as was our server whom we advised to surprise us with the sushi and to keep it coming.  i can't even tell you what we had since a lot of it wasn't on the menu, but most of it revolved around a <mark>Spicy Tuna (Big Eye)</mark> or halibut creation of some sort since we told him that that was what we really liked fish-wise.  and the dishes we got were divinely yummy!  now i don't know if vegas is a good place to judge attention of service when you're dressed for the town in heels that can double as a weapon, but i've always had exceptional service at the 2 nobus i've been to (try the nobu at the intercontinental hotel in hong kong if you get the chance) and the sushi & sashimi has always been creatively presented and fresh.\n\nnow the story ends with shirley and i winning our heady bet by our check averages per person, but it was worth every shot of sake for the trouble we got it in back at the office ; )", 
            "unfor<mark>Tuna (Big Eye)</mark>, i went to nobu vegas with the expectation that it would be like a second nobu - new york. i was rather disappointed. though the food was cheap ($77 for 2 entres and a dessert). the portions were humongous, which was sort of a turn off... waiters were not attentive but weren't ignoring us intentionally either. the food was good, very good, but not memorable and the presentation was just blah. overall, nothing special or memorable about this experience.\n\ni might still come back here again if i'm in town because the food was good. but i wouldn't recommend bringing your date here to impress her. other restaurants on the strip might be a better idea. i would compare this restaurant to chili's or tgif quality...", 
            "very very good. hard to say that it lived up to the hype, but i thought the omakase was good value for $100. i went with my parents and they also ordered the omakase. the waiter tempted us with the $150 omakase containing \"dishes not on the menu\", but being our first time at nobu, we went with the cheaper omakase. the dishes (as best as i can remember from my pics), in order: (cold-hot-sushi-soup-dessert)\n\n1) toro with spicy miso and caviar - wow, definitely one of the highlights of the omakase. super juicy, melt-in-your-mouth toro topped with a bit of caviar and sitting in a nice spicy miso sauce. omg so good. there was an interesting tiny japanese peach on the side to cleanse the palate.\n\n2) hawaiian <mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> sashimi - very nice texture and mix of flavors with the a citrus sauce, spot of spicy sauce, a sprinkle of black sea salt, and . not sure if it's on the regular menu, maybe it's called something else.\n\n3) kampachi and <mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> sashimi - super exotic and tasty. i didn't even know what kampachi was until i looked it up. apparently it's hawaiian yellowtail farmed in the open ocean off the kona coast of the big island. the trout was also very good. it looks a bit like salmon, but tastes a lot better. served with a nice miso-based sauce (i think) on the side, a couple small veggie sushi rolls, a roasted jalapeno, and a small, yellow, pear-shaped tomato sliced in half.\n\n4) black cod w/ miso - this dish really did live up to the hype. i was about to order it separately in case it did not come with the omakase, but our waiter said it is normally included in the $100 omakase since it's a very popular dish. omg so good. such delicate flavors and texture. amazing. i normally don't like to eat fish skin, but this skin is super good and flavorful. the cod is very light and flaky, but not dry. wow, this is a must try if you come to nobu.\n\n5) beef tenderloin w/ shiitake mushroom <mark>Tuna (Big Eye) and Asparagus</mark> - i didn't think this was that special and probably would not order off the regular menu. it was very good tenderloin though, cooked to a perfect medium rare, with a light sauce. it is served in a sizzling mini cast iron plate.\n\n6) nigiri sushi platter - delicious nigiri, super fresh, and most pieces i normally wouldn't order myself, but were interesting to try. tuna (best i've had in awhile), <mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark>, aji, giant clam, and sweet shrimp. mmm\n\n7) <mark><mark>Lobster <mark>Miso Soup</mark></mark></mark> w/ clams - pretty standard <mark><mark>Lobster <mark>Miso Soup</mark></mark></mark> with a few clams inside. the clams and miso is a good combination, but they can be tricky to fish out and eat with only chopsticks. i cheated on one of them and used two fingers to hold the shell. ;p\n\n8) flourless chocolate cake w/ green tea <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark> - a generous portion served in a cute <mark>Bento Box</mark>. nothing too spectacular or interesting, but delicious nonetheless. the cake was still nice and molten inside when it arrived. yum!\n\na pretty filling flight of dishes for $100. i thought it was good value to try many dishes, but i haven't seen the sizes of the normal dishes. many tables around us also ordered the omakase, as i heard the same descriptions being recited by the staff over and over. i over heard a table of french tourists behind us ordering california rolls, chicken teriyaki, tempura, and other generic stuff you can get anywhere. sigh, what a waste.\n\ni would recommend not to order anything not on the \"hot\" of \"cold\" specialty pages of the menu. the rest is basically traditional japanese fare you can get anywhere, but will probably taste better and cost a lot more at nobu. service was good, polite, and attentive. it was a bit odd when our waiter brought out the first few dishes, and then a couple other different guys brought out some of the following ones. weird.\n\nthe decor is basic, but nothing too special. the sushi bar looks cool and there's a pretty wall of bamboo poles at the back as you walk in. my parents like to eat early, so we moved our reservation to 6pm when they are supposed to open. when we arrived a few minutes early, the door was locked and they didn't seem ready yet. ten minutes later, they were ready. better to come early though, or your omakase may take two hours or longer to get through. ours took about 90 minutes because it wasn't that crowded until after 7.\n\ni think the tenderloin and dessert could have been better and more creative. otherwise, nearly flawless.\n\nif i ever return for a special occasion, i will definitely need to try the $150 omakase. with the economy in shambles, i kinda feel bad eating such an expensive dinner. for<mark>Tuna (Big Eye)</mark>, my parents picked up the tab tonight as i had paid last night at the painted pony. maybe in 2009 they will have a recession special, like gray's papaya. ;p", 
            "my first visit to a nobu outpost was about 5 years ago at nobu next door in new york city.  at that point i was still evolving into the foodie that i am today, and for some reason, i absolutely loved the hot spot.  the food was innovative; the atmosphere was exclusive; and snagging a table was a super-heroic feat.  in the years that have passed since, nobu has expanded, and i have also eaten at their nobu 57 in manhattan and the vegas location.  as food culture and my passion for it have evolved, so has my dislike of nobu.  this chain has lost its unique luster, and the quality of the dishes has become a mixed bag.  while some hot and cold courses are better than others, almost anything beats their sushi, which tastes like something ordered from a supermarket's counter.  \n\nmy sushi-fanatic friend and i recently booked a trip to vegas, and her sister had insisted that she try nobu.  i knew that my friend was focused on it, so i went along with the recommendation, though i knew better.  we wound up heading there on our first evening, which at least paved the way for better and better meals as the vacation progressed.\n\nour reservation enabled us to get a table at the crowded spot, and we were immediately seated at a prime location in the center of the dining room.  my friend ordered a glass of sangria, while i opted for a fruity martini, which was so horrifically sweet that i needed to exchange it for a basic glass of sauvignon blanc.  the wine also turned out to be very acidic and not at all similar to the waiter's description.\n\nin terms of the food, we started with two appetizers.  a tiny mound of cool, fresh salmon tartare was immersed in a small bowl of fragrant miso oil and topped with a generous helping of salty caviar.  i am very picky about my tartare, judging it by the amount or lack of flavor it exudes.  this particular version was surprisingly well-seasoned and delicious.  we also sampled one of my favorites - the rock <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark> with spicy sauce.  the succulent fried balls of rock shrimp melted in our mouths, and the spicy mayo sauce <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> a creamy kick. \n\nmy friend stayed firm on our ordering sushi, so we requested the fusion-style <mark>House Special</mark> roll and the <mark>Spicy Scallop</mark> roll.  the <mark>Spicy Scallop</mark> one was pretty flavorful, but their house blend, which included several kinds of fish, had zero taste.  we actually sent it back and did not even bother to order a replacement.\n\nunfor<mark>Tuna (Big Eye)</mark>, i think this restaurant has lost its pizazz, and my friend was not impressed either.  i would really only recommend it for its non-sushi menu items, but even those are inconsistent.", 
            "before the concert started at the hard rock, i had enough time to sit down and have a fabulous dinner. at first i thought that steak might be a good idea, but i love asian food and wanted a great experience. my boyfriend and i walked into nobu, a japanese restaurant. for our first time there, we decided to ask for assistance with the menu, and chose several things from each part.\n\ntheir menu is broken up by sushi, cold, hot and specialties. we decided to go with a little bit of everything.\n\nour favorite was the <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark>, and the crab tempura with their special sauce. their tempura shrimp and <mark>Vegetable</mark> were great also.\n\noverall, for the price of 266 dollars for two people to eat out of a tasting menu, it was a great experience. i can't say much about their food because i have to say that i've eaten better tempura at our local asian restaurant, well being in the box.\n\nalthough their tempura was okay (it was too soft and not crispy at all), their sushi was as close to the guam experience as we could get. it was sweet, done perfect, and the sauces were impeccable.\n\ni honestly didn't feel that their tempura was worth the 200 dollar ticket. that was majority of our bill. i do believe that their signature <mark>Bento Box</mark> dessert was worth 14 dollars. it was creamy, a perfect souffle, and their green tea <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark> was just like home.\n\nif you want something other than tempura for your experience at nobu, it's worth the price tag and the trip. for myself, a good japanese restaurant serves light, crispy, and fluffy tempura the way i've had it in japan and on guam from top japanese chefs. however, this was not the case, unfor<mark>Tuna (Big Eye)</mark>.\n\ni give this restaurant my personal 3/5 stars.", 
            "i've read about celebrities going to nobu.  my friend talked about nobu like it was a god of sorts.  when we found out we had a table waiting for us at nobu, i was ready to go and feast myself on its delights.  we ordered: the miso black cod, salmon nigiri, a <mark>Soft Shell Crab</mark> roll, the hamachi <mark>Yellowtail and Jalapeno</mark> appetizer, the <mark>Mushroom Salad</mark>, a vegetarian cut roll, and the tiradito.  to drink i had the cucumber martini.  it was seriously one of the best drinks i have ever had.  it tasted like it was made with lychee vodka, and was smooth, refreshing and not too sweet.  unfor<mark>Tuna (Big Eye)</mark> our positive experience ended there.  after waiting an hour for our table, we had ordered about 15 cucumber martinis and was dying for some water.  we sat at our table and for 9 people, 2 drink menus were placed on the table and then we were ignored.  i glanced at the menus, waited.  our waiter came by and i asked him for waters all around and food menus.  15 minutes go by.  we had no water, and no menus.  finally, we're given 5 menus for 9 people, as he handed me the last menu, he left saying \"we're a little short on menus.\"  we shared our menus and within 3 minutes he was back asking us what we were going to have.  we asked him for some suggestions, and he pretty much just brushed us off.  we finally ordered the hamachi <mark>Yellowtail and Jalapeno</mark>.  before i could order anything else, he rushes off.  the next time we saw him he is dropping of a plate of hamachi <mark>Yellowtail and Jalapeno</mark>.  pretty much the whole night, he just ran off with us halfway through ordering and as a result, we were unable to dine together.  i can only speak for the <mark>Mushroom Salad</mark> and vegetable cut roll.  the vegetable cut roll was pretty good, i mean, steamed <mark>Vegetable</mark>, wrapped in a cucumber wrap, with a little ponzu sauce.  the <mark>Mushroom Salad</mark> was pretty gross.  the mushrooms were varied; trumpets, oysters, shiitake, enoki.  the sauce it was cooked in was sour and as a result made the mushrooms taste bad.  everyone else thought the hamachi <mark>Yellowtail and Jalapeno</mark> were pretty good, and they loved the miso black cod.  everything else, however, they said was mediocre.  mediocreness is ok, if it wasn't coupled with poor service and a $400+ bill.  when the bill came, we inquired about the drinks on the bill as we thought we had taken care of them all at the bar.  his response?  \"no you didn't, but you can just take it out of my tip.\"  i secretly think that everybody raves about this place so much because they don't want to admit they spent that much money on a mediocre experience that you can get anywhere in san francisco for a quarter of the price.  overall verdict:  skip it.  the atmosphere is not really that great, the food isn't really that great, and the service should not be called service.  the pros: the cucumber martini was super good.", 
            "probably the best restaurant in the hrh, but very hot-and-cold.\n\nthe <mark>Creamy Spicy Crab</mark> appetizer and lotus chips were out of this world delicious.  the molten cake desert = divine.  the <mark>Spicy Tuna (Big Eye)</mark> and yellow-tail & jalapeno rolls were meh, definitely had a lot better; the seaweed seemed a bit old and the rice was over cooked.\n\nthe service there was the best i experienced in the hrh (next to the security, surprisingly awesome guys) and the atmosphere was also very nice.  i just love the concept though,  it is basically asian cuisine meets tapas.  \n\nworth it if you are staying at the hrh;  not worth seeking out... except maybe for the cake :)", 
            "i absolutely love nobu. i visit vegas 2-3 times per year. every time my husband and i go, we make it a point to dine at nobu. we always get several dishes to share. our favorites are the black cod and the jalapeno sashimi. the sashimi is to die for. i live in the sf bay area where we have a million sushi joints and i have yet to find sashimi as wonderful as nobu's - please if someone knows of a place let me know because i crave yummy sashimi. the spicy miso lotus chips <mark>Nobu Crispy Rice with Big Eye Tuna</mark> is delish too! actually, we have been happy with everything we have tried. \n\nnobu is definitely on the pricey side but so worth every penny. we are always sure to take our time with our meal and savor every bite! our bill is usually anywhere from $80 (no alcohol) to $120 (with alcohol). the other great thing is that all the wait staff work together so your plates are constantly cleared and your table cleaned. they even fold your napkin for you if you get up from the table. \n\nthe only reason why i give nobu 4 stars instead of 5 is because every so often we will get a waiter who is pompous and thinks his shit doesn't stink, which is really unfor<mark>Tuna (Big Eye)</mark> because most of the wait staff is really great! if i could knock only a half star off for that, i would!", 
            "nirvana - pure nirvana. my taste buds were happy, i was very happy. \n\nmy bf too me here (my first trip) for our saturday night dinner. we knew when we walked in that we were having the omakase. i truly cannot pick out one single dish that i liked over the others - every single one was executed perfectly. our waiter was kind enough to write down what we had so we could remember. though he didn't write down the sake pairings we had - every single one of them matched perfectly with the dish. my only sadness with the sake is that i can't buy it anywhere since it is made for nobu (perhaps time to sale it at the restaurant???) \n\ncourse 1: kumomoto oysters, wrapped in <mark>Smoked Salmon</mark> with osetra caviar, served with endive <mark>Tuna (Big Eye) and Asparagus</mark> in sweet and spicy miso sauces (sweet and spicy? oysters? what is not to love?) \n\ncourse 2: <mark>Shima Aji</mark> sashimi served in tosazu gelee with micro celery and sea grapes kelp; garnished with pickled turnip (i'm not normally a turnip fan, but you could serve this to me anytime!) \n\ncourse 3: bluefin tuna sashimi topped <mark>Squid 'Pasta' with Light Garlic</mark> puree and sliced jalapeno, served <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> emulsion over brown rice salsa (okay a truly unique dish - and it was spicy! you know i like spice in my life!) \n\ncourse 4: <mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> trout and seared sweet shrimp <mark><mark>Nobu's Moriawase Sashimi Salad</mark></mark> served with mache, peppercorn, <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Whole <mark>1/2 Maine Lobster</mark></mark> <mark>Roasted Poussin with Spicy Lemon</mark></mark> dressing. (this fish was so succulent, buttery and full of flavor - if only i could find this in dc) \n\ncourse 5: pan seared seagrass, seasonal mushrooms, wild ramps, served in <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> sauce \n\ncourse 6: grilled washu beef with eared <mark>Teppan Style Foie Gras</mark>, served over yellow sweet corn and snap peas <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark>-mirin reduction \n\ncourse 7: soup with huge chunks of lobster (yup - huge); loved the little enoki mushrooms in it! \n\ncourse 8: sushi: one standout for me - salt <mark>Fresh Water Eel</mark> with this leaf that kinda tasted like basil <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Whole <mark>1/2 Maine Lobster</mark></mark> <mark>Roasted Poussin with Spicy Lemon</mark></mark> together. wow - yummy (this from the girl who wouldn't eat eel for a long time). not that the other offerings weren't good. \n\ncourse 9: dessert. panna cotta (i think) with strawberry caviar - the caviar was awesome! \n\nfinal: three types of fruit sake. my favorite was the ginger. \n\ni have to say this was one of the highlights of our trip. thoroughly enjoyed the meal and would gladly go again and again.", 
            "went i went to this particular nobu four years ago, it was outstanding. perfection on all front. really some of the best food and service i've ever had. since then, i'm not quite sure if my palate has become more discerning and/or nobu has lost just a little of it's shine. either way, it was still a great meal overall. \n\nhubs and i made a reservation here for my birthday dinner while in vegas. we put a note in the reservation stating so and while it's not a huge deal, we didn't hear happy birthday from our host, server or receive any sort of birthday love. our server was just fine, although he didn't seem to be the happiest of lads. maybe he was having a rough night. regardless, we went on an ordering spree and here's what we snacked on...\n\njalape\\u00f1o hamachi: 5/5: bright, flavorful and incredibly fresh. exactly what i remember about nobu! \n\nehu: 4/5: per the server a new-ish item on the mean, ehu is a short tail <mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark>. i've yet to taste ehu before, but it's a flaky white fish. taste overall was a bit overworked with multiple elements on the plate, but it was tasty. \n\nrock shrimp: 3/5: last time i was at nobu, hubs and i ordered two servings of this. not heart healthy but it used to be creamy and delicious with the shrimp perfectly flash fried. this go around it was clumpier, sticker and not quite as creamy. \n\nblack cod: 3/5: another dish that i used to love. this visit the cod was watery and lacked the complex flavor the miso previously provided. \n\nspicy <mark>Big Eye Tuna Roll</mark>: 4/5: standard <mark>Spicy Tuna (Big Eye)</mark>. fresh, delicious and on the mark. \n\nthis visit was a good one but not a great one overall. i'm still a fan of the ambiance and the creative menu items so here's hoping i came on an off-ish night!", 
            "i was really excited to eat here, especially with all the hype.  unfor<mark>Tuna (Big Eye)</mark>, i was disappointed.  \nthere were 8 of us for a bachelorette party, the service was poor considering the price point for this restaurant.\nwhile the server did warn us the rolls are 'very standard', it seems like if you're a sushi/japanese restaurant of this reputation you should have 'standard' anything.\ngranted the <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> was nice, but again - not drop your jaw amazing.\n\nbesides that, the taxi line at the hard rock is not worth it.", 
            "at the time of this review, there were 507 preceding mine. \nwhy bother? i asked myself.\nif a yelper can't conclude what this place is about in the first ten or so reviews, (4 stars or higher) how's mine going to make a difference?\nthen it hit me.\ni could review the table setting..\nso here you go, my review of nobu las vegas, and my table experience.\n\nour table was nice and had all the features one would expect of a nice table such as legs and a top.\nit didn't wobble either, nice and firm, some may even say heavy. \nand it was slightly rectangular, with a nice wood surface. very pleasant looking.\n\nadorning our table were some chopsticks, and a couple of plates. the plates were nice. small but nice, and as plates go, they seemed a better quality of porcelain than most. they were also square. this caught my eye right away, as i sat there thinking, \"gee, these plates are square...how cool is that?\"\nand highly functional too!\nwe used them to eat our food from, carefully filling them with food from the serving dish, which was also nice, only much bigger and a lot  nicer than our little square plates\nwhen the food was on our small square plate, we then used our chopsticks to start eating, which i should mention, worked just fine. \n\nnow let me stop here.\nit would be sinful of me not to mention the chopstick presentation.\nmy chopsticks came in a nicely wrapped white package, similar to what drinking straws come wrapped in. \nhowever.\nour server, opened them up for us, carefully placing them on a cute little black rock. or maybe it was a stone. i'm not certain. \nthe stone was small and black, and looked like it might have been some kind of vintage variety of stone, (or rock) that i've never seen before...almost resembling an apache tear or something. it may have been volcanic too, i'm not sure. \nthis is what made me think it was a stone or lava, and not a rock.\nanyways, kudos on the stone selection. \n\nthen there was the little container of soy sauce. \nomg!\nit was small and looked like a miniature teapot, like something alice would use when she was small alice and not big alice. \ni take that back. \nit would have been about the same size as small alice, so forget i said that.\nanywho,  it was white, and cute, and had a nice little pouring spout. \n\noverall, my table was amazing. its size and shape. just the perfect thing to eat off of. nice and clean too, adorned with plates, a cute stone, some chopsticks, and a miniature teapot.\n\noh, and one more thing. \nthere was a napkin too. i think it was linen but i''m not sure. \nlarge and colorful, it did a nice job of wiping my face, hands, and, i think i even  may have sneezed into it once. \ni don't recall, but i'm pretty sure i did. \nthe large napkin would have been a bonus had i needed to spit anything out that didn't suit me,  leaving a large unused portion of it to clean up with afterward.\nbut for<mark>Tuna (Big Eye)</mark>, i didn't have to spit anything out.\nprobably never will either... not as good as their food is. \n\nif you go, i highly recommend one of the small rectangular tables.\nthey're soooo amazing.", 
            "unbelievable meal. would not recommend getting sushi here the cooked dishes are definitely the way to go. sushi was pretty standard but very expensive.  i was not wowed by the quality of the fish and considering the price i think there are better spots for sushi.  the fried snapper, chili paste and truffle oil edamame, hamachi <mark>King Crab with Amazu Ponzu</mark> sauce,  and <mark>Crab <mark><mark>XO and Jamon Iberico</mark> <mark>Beef <mark>Crab Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark></mark> balls with <mark>Spicy Tuna (Big Eye)</mark>. were some of my favorite dishes.",

            "nobu is awesome. i've never been to a nobu before until this past weekend when i was in vegas for a bachelorette party. the decor inside the restaurant was pretty nice. service wasn't too bad, but it could have been a pinch better. felt like our waitress was spread out a little too thin and trying to cover too many tables, but when she was around, she gave us the time and explained things pretty thoroughly.\n\nmy favorite dish of the night was the <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> (i normally don't like raw fish, but this one was freaking awesome!), <mark><mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> Salad</mark> (i normally don't eat fields of green salad, but this was an exception!), miso black cod (very yummy), the <mark>Bento Box</mark> dessert was great (esp the chocolate flourless cake which was very soft) and the mango caramel <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark> dessert. the <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark> was lighted flavored mango and there were caramel bits in there that was just great. probably my favorite dessert that i've ever had.\n\noverall the food was fantastic. definitely would head back to nobu again next time i'm in vegas. they're opening one closeby and i'll be definitely dining there in the future.", 
            "nobu is a great place to splurge when you have time and want to have good japanese food.  a few quick notes about how to eat there.\n\n1, i've heard the omikase is excellent. it's a safe way to try a nice selection of things.\n2, be nice to your waiter, and it will make all the difference. in general, be nice to the person that brings you your food, and you'll have a better, healthier, more hygenic meal, but here, being nice can mean great service, good advice, and a wonderful experience. i have 1 friend who is a waiter there, and if he can't serve me when i go, i make sure one of the other folks who has helped him wait on me before is my waiter, and i've never had a bad meal, bad location, or bad service.\n3, the black cod <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark>, and hamachi <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> and ponzu are  musts on the menu. i also recommend the squid pasta, rock <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark>, <mark><mark>Nobu's Moriawase Sashimi Salad</mark></mark>, and spicy <mark>Big Eye Tuna Roll</mark>.  the spicy <mark>Big Eye Tuna Roll</mark> there is the best version i've ever had.  the black cod is probably the best treatment of cooked fish i've ever consumed.\n4, enjoy the celebrity spotting. i actually sat next to wayne brady (a very nice guy, and super polite to the staff) at one dinner, and tiffany amber thiessen was there a different night. i can't say the same nice things about her that i mentioned about wayne brady.\n\nall in all, a great meal.  and get the nigori sake...best bang for your buck alcohol wise, and very tasty.", 
            "i was really ready to give nobu an average rating - how much can you really pay for fish?  how good could it really be?  it really is that good.\n\ni was in vegas for a bachelorette party <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> girlfriends, and we went to nobu.  i'd been to nobu next door ages ago in nyc...and i thought it was good but not outstanding.  apparently they save the good stuff for the \"real\" restaurant.\n\ni was underwhelmed by the resaurant decor - it seemed a little bit like any generic japanese restaurant.  but the food was awesome.  we had the tuna <mark><mark>Nobu's Moriawase Sashimi Salad</mark></mark> - tuna was so good and the salad dressing was awesome (i love japanese salad dressing), hamachi <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> peppers, salmon sashimi with chives (loved it - and i'm not even a huge salmon fan), miso cod (liked it...but definitely loved the sashimi more) and the real winner i wasn't expecting was this <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark> dish...  tiny pieces of friend shrimp covered in some sort of mayonnaise-y kind of sauce.  delish.  \nto accommodate some non-fish eaters, we got chicken which was fine, but really, who goes to nobu for chicken?  \n\ni may have to take out a second mortgage on my non-existent house, but it was worth it...",

            "nobu. . .narcissistic. . .outrageous. . .bracing . . .unconventional.  these are just a few words that come to mind after i experienced nobu. because really, you don't dine or even eat at nobu . . .you experience it with all of your senses. yes, it is expensive, but what do you expect? you're in vegas, a city that thrives on the temptation and transiency of money. \n\nit is glaringly obvious that the chefs at nobu approach sushi and food like art. from the flawless presentation of each plate to the masterful blending of the phenomenal flavors, dining here is like watching art unveil itself. i tasted unique creations at nobu that i have never tasted before anywhere else, nor will i probably ever come across again except at this restaurant. every time a new plate arrived at our table, i felt like applauding (and in many instances, we did). i can not even begin to describe the parade of culinary wonders that we experienced. there was hamachi <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark>, kobe beef carpaccio, marinated cod lettuce wraps, and a wide variety of sashimi and rolls that blew your mind (to name a few). each was an explosive fusion of the far east and the rest of the world that stimulated your taste buds. they also have an impressive selection of flavored sake that only serves to emphasize the aromatics of the food.\n\nnot only is nobu candy for your soul, it is candy for the eyes as well. don't be surprised if you dine next to an unshaven justin timberlake, bitchy paris hilton, drunk vince vaughn or bald britney spears. just remember to play it cool, you are at nobu after all.", 
            "more like 3 1/2 stars.  i've been to the ny and miami ones, and this is 2nd behind nyc.  good food and service for the most part.  \nfresh <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> - yum, though presentation was better at nyc\nrock <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark> <mark>King Crab with Amazu Ponzu</mark> and chili pepper - yum\n<mark>King Crab Ceviche</mark>- yum\n<mark>Creamy Spicy Crab</mark> - doubt this is authentic but if you love mayo like i do...yum\nwashu beef - served <mark>White Fish <mark>Scallop <mark>Salmon <mark>Oyster <mark>Beef <mark>Yuba Sashimi New Style</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark> - like a carpaccio drizzled with sesame oil - yum\n\nthis is where i would take points away:\n-the space is not that impressive for the prices\n-bathroom being way back out in the casino.  every food establishment should have a convenient place to wash your hands!\n-uni was so--- not fresh,  it was bitter!  though as soon as i mentioned it, the waiter took it off our bill.  i'm just surprised a place of this caliber would serve anything with poor quality.\n-though i expect the specials to be pricey, it would be courteous to mention to a party of two that one of them is $120!", 
            "when nobu opened in new york city, it created a sensation.  reservations were nearly impossible to get, and its new interpretation of traditional japanese food was widely praised.  this led to the inevitable branding of the restaurant; nobu can be found all over the globe.\n\nmeal #1: i found las vegas nobu's sushi highly variable.  the overall quality was ok, but some items (e.g., uni) were poor while others (e.g., ankimo) were good.  orange and honey flavored sake was interesting but probably not worth repeating.\n\n\nmeal #2:  since my first meal, i went to nobu in miami beach, sat in the dining room and had the omakase meal.  i enjoyed that a bit more, so decided to give the vegas location another shot.\n\nthe restaurant looks ok, but nothing great.  it's very noisy, in keeping with the hard rock atmosphere.  the crowd is mostly young, but i think anyone would feel comfortable here; i did.  service is pleasant, although all the servers are running around at full speed.\n\nnow, on to the meal:\n\n    * i chose jyunmai daiginjyo sake.  it wasn't bad, but was a trifle harsh.\n    * small japanese spring roll with balsamic vinaigrette reduction.  good.\n    * trio of raw seafood: sea scallop slice, oyster, ama ebi (raw shrimp).  all served with onion and other spices, although each was slightly different.  good.\n    * seared maguro and a slightly strong flavored fish, <mark>Squid 'Pasta' with Light Garlic</mark> chips and a pickled ginger shoot.  a good combination.  very good.\n    * uni (<mark>Sea Urchin</mark>) <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> white fish, served on sliced eggplant.  the uni was seared and was surprisingly delicious.  there was also a tiny river crab, to be eaten shell and all; interesting for the crunch, not the flavor.  very good.\n    * o toro and a spring roll <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> sauce and radish.  the o toro was good but a little chewy, and the strong sauce tended to overwhelm the tuna.  good to very good.\n    * palate cleanser: intensely flavored, sweet/sour mango sorbet, on top of a red granite with little flavor.\n    * service lapse.  up to this point, courses had been timed well.  at this point, i waited for about 15 minutes, with no explanation.  this was a little annoying.\n    * grilled sea scallop on a bed of mushrooms, bits of seafood, and brown rice.  very good.\n    * <mark>Teppan Style Foie Gras</mark> and kobe beef.  a large hunk of <mark>Teppan Style Foie Gras</mark>; good flavor.  kobe beef very good.  overall, very good to excellent.\n    * service lapse: the next course was supposed to be sushi, followed by <mark><mark>Lobster <mark>Miso Soup</mark></mark></mark>.  they reversed the order, and apologized later.  a minor matter.\n    * <mark><mark>Lobster <mark>Miso Soup</mark></mark></mark>.  better than average; good fish stock flavor, not too salty.  very good.\n    * sushi: o-toro (tuna belly), <mark>Shima Aji</mark> (variety of mackerel?), some kind of crab, unagi (eel).  very good.\n    * fruit papillote.  like a crepe.  the raspberry seeds were very distracting.  fair.\n    * honey <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark>.  very strong honey flavor.  strange, but i liked it.  very good.\n\noverall, the meal was good, but not as good as nobu in miami, and not nearly as good as okada.  at the price they charge ($120), they need to do better.\n\n\nmeal #3: based on past meals, i hadn't planned to return. however, i found myself at the hard rock hotel at meal time, and no other choices looked appealing. i decided to go for unusual choices, hoping this would be a strength. this worked out better. my selections:\n\n    * ankimo (steamed monkfish liver). standard but still very good.\n    * <mark>Hamachi Kama</mark> (grilled yellowtail collar). this is a chunk of fish, skin and bone, served grilled. it may not sound like much, and it's a little difficult to get the flesh out, but it's usually very rich and very tasty. i was both happy and sad with my choice: it was very good, but not as good as elsewhere. if you'd like to try this dish, order it robatayaki style at okada.\n    * live shrimp. these santa barbara shrimp were killed in front of me, so i guess that means they're fresh. they were big and rather chewy; i'm guessing the latter is due to their recent demise. the heads were served tempura style, and were juicy and tasty.\n    * live octopus. i'm not sure that it was live, but slices of the tentacle, served raw, were indeed very fresh tasting - and much less chewy than the cooked version. pretty good.\n\nthis was the most satisfying of my meals at nobu. nothing was stellar, but everything was good.\n\n\n\nnobu's strength is its new take on japanese foods.  its weaknesses are sushi that isn't in the same class with the better places in las vegas, and suspect service.  given such high prices, i'd look elsewhere.", 
            "i wish all of my meals in vegas were this good.  i don't even know where to begin.  the yellow tail <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> that i was allowed to taste was delicious.  i could have ordered 5 plates of it alone and been happy with my meal.  thankfully being with the group i was with that wasn't allowed to happen and i enjoyed several other items from the menu.\n\nfor myself i ordered the chilean sea bass with a <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark> rub, the <mark><mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark></mark>, uni nigiri, and scallop sashimi.  the sea bass had a very mild flavor although the <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark> was tasty.  i think grilling sea bass rather than steaming it brings out the buttery flavor that it naturally has much better.  the <mark><mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark></mark> was great and i could have had a couple more but i held off so i could enjoy my entire meal.  the uni was good, although i don't think the wait staff would be able to tell you whether the uni is good that day or not if you asked.  i'm sure the people preparing the meals would just opt not to serve the uni if they happen to not be able to get some good stuff in that day.  at least i hope so.  the surprise of the meal was the scallop sashimi. it was presented beautifully in a little hollowed out lime cup.  with a dash of soy and wasabi the flavor was amazing.  i really should have gotten at least one more order.\n\ni was also able to try some of the tempura rock shrimp, miso black cod, and the wagyu beef.  all were great but the wagyu beef and miso black cod were crazy delicious and will be must order items the next time i eat at nobu.\n\nfor dessert i had the hibiscus sorbet with champagne jelly and rock candy.  the popping of the rock candy (pop rocks) in your mouth with the flavor of the hibiscus sorbet and champagne jelly was more fun than some of the yelp events i've been to.", 
            "if you can manage to get a reservation, do not pass this place up.  it is the best sushi that i've ever had outside of japan.  in fact, they actually fly the fish in fresh from japan every single day.  \n\nmy menu recommendations -- ie get these three things or don't bother going at all -- are the miso eggplant, the <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> and cilantro in yuzu sauce, and the thinly sliced white fish in ponzu sauce.  though i have extensive experience with the nobu menu, in my opinion these three dishes are the most outstanding options on the menu.  now when i go to nobu, i gorge myself by ordering multiples of just these three dishes.\n\ni also recommend their restaurant beer brand.  it's lighter and more crisp than most japanese beer, and in fact, tastes more like a chinese beer to me.", 
            "i really wanted to try nobu after having an amazing experience at morimoto in philly.  i was not disappointed.  we arrived promptly at our reservation time and were seated immediately.  upon being seated we were greeted by our server within moments.    the atmosphere at nobu is much different than morimoto...nobu is more lively and trendy.  \n\nthey have you order a few dishes from the three parts of their menu.  we started with the oysters and the <mark><mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark></mark> which is served in lettuce wraps.  the lettuce wraps were quite good and the oysters were very earthy tasting. \n\nfor our second course we chose the <mark>Creamy Spicy Crab</mark> and the rock <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark> in butter ponzu.  the <mark>Creamy Spicy Crab</mark> may be one of the best dishes i've ever tasted in a restaurant.  at the end of our weekend i asked my brother in law what his favorite thing was about vegas and he responded without hesitation \"eating <mark>Creamy Spicy Crab</mark> at nobu.\"  not the club, not winning $300, not seeing old friends....the <mark>Creamy Spicy Crab</mark>.  \n\nwe chose 4 sushi rolls for our main course, the house roll which is like a rainbow row except the fish on the inside, a spider roll, unagi avocado (not on the menu but they happily prepared it for us) <mark>Yellowtail and Scallion</mark>.  each of the rolls was well prepared and the fish was fresh.\n\nfor dessert we ordered assorted mochi, which caused brother in law to wet himself for the second time that night.  our assortment included tiramisu, pistachio, honeydew, and raspberry.   all were amazing.\n\nthe service was outstanding throughout the night.  the meal was well paced, it wasn't the lingering three hour affair we had at morimoto but we didn't feel rushed at any point.  in the end i felt that the bill was actually fairly reasonable for what we ordered.  including tip and alcohol it came to about $90 a person.  i do have to <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> it did bother me slightly to find that some of the customers were wearing sneakers, open toe sandals (on men) and collarless shirts.  when i made our reservation they informed me that the dress code did not include these things, which is totally fine.  i'm all for getting dressed up to go out to eat, especially in vegas, and especially at a place like nobu, but i do not like it when i go through the effort and others don't have to.", 
            "i got stranded in vegas once when la air traffic control cancelled all flights into la during the la fires. \n\nthat night, my coworker/buddy danny and i decided to splurge and try this \"nobu\" place out... and it was amazing! damn!!!\n\nsince then i have dined at nobu almost every time i've been in town. in fact, i even had my 30th birthday dinner there last year! \n\nnow, based on that experience, i wouldn't recommend nobu for large groups... it becomes too complicated and they pair down the menu for you so you can't please everyone and charge auto-gratuity, etc... let's just say it can be a hassle.\n\nhowever, for a date or a group of 4 or so people, it's great! \n\nthe decor is simple. the staff is more than ample. and i want to install that polished black river rock wall they have in my house! i digress... \n\nwhile, i haven't had enough sushi here to comment, my must-order menu is as follows:\n-chilled toro tuna <mark>Yellowtail or Salmon <mark>Blue Fin <mark>Toro Tartare</mark> with Royal Ossetra Caviar</mark></mark>: too rich for one man!\n-roasted arctic char with airfried spinach. soo tenda'\n-the cod! buttery, delicious, melts right in yo mouth!\n-baked crab legs! creamy, buttery. do not try to eat this on your own! \n\nyou cannot go wrong with any of these choices... unless you have high-blood pressure or are allergic to shellfish...",

            "unfrigginbelievable!!  i went last saturday for a friends bachelor party and it was just an amazing experience of food.  there were 12 of us and after looking at the menu for 2 min, we just said f-it and just asked the waiter to bring the best stuff out.  \n\nwent down like this...\n\n2 huge plates of <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> and tuna tataki\n<mark>King Crab Ceviche</mark> which was incredible\nkobe beef served sizzling on hot stones which i would've just preferred rare but still excellent medium rare\n<mark>Black Cod Miso</mark> filet (wait...things are still getting better??)\nhuge plate of sushi to top it all off\n\ntasted even better comped :)\n\ni cannot wait to go back here!!", 
            "must orders:\n(*) <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark>\n(*) miso glazed black cod lettuce wraps\n(*) rock <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark> with 3 different kinds of sauces", 
            "the <mark>Lobster <mark>Tuna <mark>King Crab <mark>Vegetable <mark>Salmon Nobu Style Taco</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark> were probably the most whimsical, brilliant, west coast culinary delight that i've ever tasted.  sounds simple, but i dare any high end mexican eatery to execute as well as the chefs at nobu.\n\nthe <mark>Yellowtail or Salmon <mark>Blue Fin <mark>Toro Tartare</mark> with Royal Ossetra Caviar</mark></mark> was different than anything i've ever put in my mouth.  top 5 meals of my life.", 
            "this is the second time i've been to nobu in vegas and once again i was pleasantly surprised. it started with our waiter, very friendly and helpful. he even asked what budget we had and offered to choose our entrees for us. i only had 2 must haves: the halibut <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> slivers on each slice.. yummers! i also love the tiny tacos (no idea what is in them but they are scrumptious). everything else was great from the kabobs to sushi rolls.\n\nanother thing i enjoy about this place is the list of beverages. we only had cocktails but they have several sake cocktails that are oh so tasty.\n\nthe menu can be overwhelming so i suggest you ask your server what he/she recommends so you get to taste the best of the best nobu has to offer.\n\natmosphere is very vegas, dark and loud. don't be surprised if you get hit on!!", 
            "for whatever reason, my friend and i felt the need to fly 5+ hours to eat at two restaurants that have locations in ny (nobu and craftsteak), but whatever.  the food here was good, but i felt like the waiter was pushing us to order a ridiculous amount of food which would have been a total waste for my friend and i.  the hamachi <mark>Yellowtail and Jalapeno</mark> appetizer was quite good and of course, i had to order the miso black cod, which was good, but not the best fish i've ever eaten (in fact, the fish my friend got was better.)  the drinks were decent.  all told, a nice meal, but pretty expensive.", 
            "this was the first time ever i've dined with three other yelpers so i'm curious to see where the other reviews come in. personally, four stars is a little high but i really enjoyed three dishes and didn't dislike anything so i'll give it four, albeit unenthusiastically. (i don't think i've ever typed a longer word than \"unenthusiastically\").\n\nthe black cod <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark> was the highlight. the kobe beef was amazing too but we all misread the menu and when that showed up at $192 i'd call it hands down the most overpriced thing i've ever eaten. the <mark>Scallop</mark> topped <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> were the third great dish. the sushi was fine though nothing spectacular.\n\nthe ambiance is surprisingly boring, especially for vegas. it looks the way a japanese restaurant might if designed by the high-school drama department - all cheap bamboo reeds and sloppy wood structures. and the service, though efficient, was humorless. any waitress who can't understand the genius in asking if there are any beef-based <mark>Dessert</mark> off the menu is not winning any points with me.\n\nstill, the price minus the kobe was totally reasonable, especially for vegas. and the matsuhisa martinis go a long way toward <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> up to a pretty good meal.", 
            "i agree with ming-jou in the fact that i was totally disappointed at this place. i should have also listened to my friend who went there and was really disappointed at their omakase, but being japanese, i wanted to try their food to see what the hype was about.  we had reservations at 9 pm and although we got there earlier, they didn't seat us till then.  it was shockingly a loud place that we often had to yell at each other to talk and even to order.  also, the crowd was much older than i anticipated.  the interior had a nice asian feel to it with bamboos everywhere, even on the ceilings.\n\nfor starters, we had edamame, yellowtail tartar <mark>Yellowtail or Salmon <mark>Blue Fin <mark>Toro Tartare</mark> with Royal Ossetra Caviar</mark></mark>, <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark>.  the menu was vague that we didn't expect any sauce with the tartar, but to our surprise, it came in a sauce with wasabi that was a little spicy.  i wish the menu would have included more details.  we got to order individual tempura items, which was a \"first\" for me.  we ordered shrimp, broccoli, and sweet potato.  the order came with 2 pieces each.  i liked how it came out really hot with light batter.  also, they were generous with their tempura sauce with daikon-oroshi (grated daikon).  most places give you barely enough sauce.  for dinner, we shared the <mark>Sushi Dinner</mark> which came with 8 nigiri and 6 pieces of tekka maki (<mark>Big Eye Tuna Roll</mark>).  the sushi rice tasted old as it was cold and flat, not warm and plump.  also, the rice portion for a nigiri was much more than it needed.  fish seemed fresh, but the rice was disappointing.  that ruined my dinner.\n\nwe decided to try their dessert since we don't usually order dessert at an asian restaurant.  we tried their miso almond cake which was the best part of my meal.  it came <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> caramel glaze and edamame <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark>.  the cake was yummier than i expected.  \n\noverall, it was not as good as i expected but i'm giving 3 stars for the good dessert and the great service.", 
            "yellow tail <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark>= out of this world\n\nthe reason why i am giving it a 3 star instead of 5 is because i've been to the malibu location for nobu and it is a lot better. also, there is no bathroom in the restaurant, you have to walk through the casino, through the nasty drunken guys who whistle and harrass you, just so you can go to the bathroom, it makes it hard to enjoy your cocktail during dinner when you know if you gotta go, you'd have to make a journey to find the restroom, and once you're there, there's a huge line full of drunk girls waiting to use the restroom as well. i would think for such a high scale restaurant, that there would at least be a bathroom inside. \n\nother than that.. the food's amazing, the bloodymary was delicious, the sangria was good too! the service is acceptable for the price you are paying for, and it's great because they expanded the place, so there is rarely a wait to be seated. p.s. the dessert is presented really pretty thaty you don't want to ruin it by eating it lol", 
            "i'm not going to lie--a small part of me dies every time i think about how much we spent here.  but the truth of the matter is, you can't get good sushi without paying for it.  \n\nwe ordered the $100 omakase, the uni tempura set, kabocha tempura, and salmon sashimi.\n\nthe fusion dishes (like the hamachi <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> or the snapper with cucumber <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Whole <mark>1/2 Maine Lobster</mark></mark> <mark>Roasted Poussin with Spicy Lemon</mark></mark> juice) were fun to try but i find that the sauces often overpower the fish, which is the best thing about nobu.  if you have never tried any of their signature dishes, you might want to order at least one of the omakase options, but if you're just looking to enjoy the fish qua fish, then order the sashimi and/or nigiri a la carte.\n\nand yes, let's talk about the fish.  i have never had such a wonderfully buttery miso black cod!  and the toro, maguro, aji, trout, and sake (as in salmon sashimi) simply melted in our mouths.  no biting necessary.  the only low point was that the anago in our complimentary sushi was littered with small fish bones but hey, it was complimentary!  yet another reason why i love nobu.  they know how to treat the ladies right.\n\nas for the tempura, the kabocha was out of season, so it was our bad for ordering it in the first place, but the uni tempura was unlike anything i have ever had.  every bite was bursting with succulence and the tempura batter <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> extra texture and flavor.  heavenly.  anyone who is a fan of uni and/or tempura needs to try this!  it also comes with tempura shiitake mushroom (luxuriously juicy), tempura shiso leaf (so crispy, so light), and one other <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark> that i forget but that my mom thought was delicious.\n\nthe dessert was lovely too--we had the <mark>Bento Box</mark> which consists of flourless chocolate cake and homemade green tea <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark>.  not too sweet and the perfect way to end a perfect meal.\n\ni seriously cannot wait to come back here again and try the <mark>Hamachi Kama</mark>, the snapper, the whole fried fish, and the squid salad.  is it expensive?  yes.  but is it worth it?  most definitely.", 
            "wow. i was seriously impressed with this place. this place ranks second to french laundry on my list of favorites. \n\nfirst- if you are a first time visitor there, i would recommend just ordering off of the menu. i am sure the omakase is great but you have to try the signature dishes- and you may not get to try them all with the omakase. \n\nsecond- don't have the sushi be your primary focus. it's okay- but the other items are so much better. we saw people around us doing nothing but order sushi- what a waste! \n\nthird- the warm dishes tended to be larger portions than the cold and raw dishes. just a fyi if you want to budget your appetite and your wallet. i also felt that the dishes with a tart factor (see below) were too overwhelming. i would pass on these- imo the tartness is so much you can't enjoy the other flavors that might be there. \n\nwe started with edammame and the sheshito peppers. pass on the edamamme - there is nothing great about it- and you don't need to fill up your tummy with average stuff. the sheshito peppers were really good. they taste like small green bell peppers and the miso and sesame sauce on top has a great flavor. my husband is so picky when it comes to veggies and he even enjoyed this. my only word of caution- occasionally you get a spicy one! \n\nso we relied on our fellow yelpers and ordered the following items: \n\n1. <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> - definitely get this- it was awesome! \n\n2. the blackened miso cod- by far, the highlight of the evening \n\n3. chilean sea bass- cooked the special of the day way (yummy)- it had tomatoes, and onions, some white wine sauce \n\n4. kobe beef on skewers- pass- it was okay but not great \n\n5. <mark><mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark></mark>- pass- the tartness was way too overwhelming \n\n6. red <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark> - pass- again, tartness too overwhelming \n\n7. then we ordered some basic filler items- tempura, sushi (ca rolls and ama ebi)- all which were fine. \n\n8. we ordered the <mark>Bento Box</mark> dessert- it was ok- not fantastic. \n\noverall- the meal was great. the <mark>Black Cod Miso</mark> cod was so good- it had the right blend of sweetness with saltiness, and the fish was so tender it literally melts in your mouth. the chilean sea bass had the same texture and effect, but it costs about twice the amount as the black cod (a tidbit for those of you who are watching the $$s). \n\nwe had starved ourselves earlier in the day and were totally stuffed by the end of the meal. the whole meal with tip was just over $300. i highly recommend this place. it was the only restaurant that we went to in the older part of vegas that was great.", 
            "this is my second time here and both times i've come with my cousin. as much i love nobu, i only go there with her, since she loves it so much, but i never regret it. \n\nthe nice thing is i just let her order, since she knows what's good, but then if i ever go alone, i won't really know what to order. i did have a nice acai cocktail to start the night. it was delicious and refreshing, great way to start the meal. \n\nwe ordered the <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> which i loved since i love the spice. then we had the seafood spring rolls which weren't on the menu, but since they go there all the time, they knew about it. those were also really good, along with the <mark><mark>Nobu's Moriawase Sashimi Salad</mark></mark>. loved the dressing and there was so much sashimi! we also had the rock <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark>, which was kinda like popcorn shrimp, but really tasty <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> grilled beef thing. \n\nat the end, we ordered the <mark>Bento Box</mark>, which was a flourless chocolate cake with green tea <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark>. everything was really good, but service was a little slow. my other friends were also there and they were a party of 10. they started a little after us but finished before us!! other than that though, it was a great night.", 
            "i was in vegas for my birthday and my friends and i went here for my birthday meal. everything was delicious! my favorites were the yellow tail <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> and the black cod <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark> sauce. amazing! our waiter wasn't very friendly but the food made up for it. i will definitely go again!", 
            "all i have to say is.....\nblack cod with dried miso lettuce wraps =ftw!\n\nmy family decided to go a bit fancy and tried nobu at the hardrock in las vegas and i have to say, \"wow!\"  the food is amazing!  \n\ni have learned that at places like these, you know you are going to spend money.  so, why not eat the \"speciality\" things they are known for rather than food you can always get at another restaurant.  so, i ordered the yellow tail <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark>, the salmon tataki with cilantro dressing, <mark><mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark></mark>, and my favorite thing in the whole wide world= the black cod <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark> lettuce wraps!  \n\nomg!  this fish was amazing.  i didn't want to stop eating the lettuce wrap and never wanted it to end!  \n(i know it sounds very sexual but once you have this dish, you too will feel like you had a sexual encounter in your mouth!  -that's what she said!)\n\ni say if you ever have that one night when you want to go fancy while your in vegas and don't mind spending the money and want a very delicious experience, you need to go to nobu at the hardrock!  \n\nonce again let me say this again!  \nyou have to try the black cod with dried miso lettuce wraps!", 
            "i had high expectation coming in and left feeling somewhat unsatisfied.  while i do think nobu is a great sushi place to experience, it's a bit over hyped and is priced accordingly..\n\nthe place was not well lid so we opted for the sushi bar where we could actually see the food.  our sushi chef was cool, attentive, and a superb artisan.  i ordered the omakase ($100) and was pretty happy with the variety of dishes:\n1) toro <mark>Yellowtail or Salmon <mark>Blue Fin <mark>Toro Tartare</mark> with Royal Ossetra Caviar</mark></mark> - this was the highlight dish .. fabulous!\n2) 4 different sashimi dishes - <mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark>, yellowtail and a few others .. exotic varieties, beautifully presented, but a bit overpowered by the sauces .. i left nobu with a very strong ponzu aftertaste\n3) black cod .. good but sooooo overrated.  the sauce was just too strong for this delicate fish.  \n4) tenderloin with shitake and enoki mushrooms - i really regret asking to have this well done.  doh!\n5) 5 different pieces of sushi - ameabi, grilled eel, and a few others .. all were pretty good.\n\nthe waiting service was lacking for a fine dining establishment.  i found that the best waiting services are those that are not very visible but are attentive and will serve your needs before being asked.  nobu's staff, while very nice, was more of the opposite.  you see lots of guys crowding the restaurant but still have to ask and wait for stuffs.  the predominately male wait staffs also makes me wonder how tough it must be to compete for female employees with the local cabarets.\n\nbottom line:  i'm glad i tried nobu.  but, it'll be a long while before i come back especially when there are so many other options there in vegas.", 
            "it was saturday night in vegas, we wanted sushi, and nobu didnt even cross my mind until my boyfriend made reservations for the same night. i quickly logged on to yelp to check the latest reviews as i do with any restaurant, and i am happy to say that i am ecstatic i did this, because had i not, i would have missed out on the black cod <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark>.... which is without a doubt, one the best things that i have ever tasted. \n\nmy bf and i shared 4 dishes and 1 dessert, washed it down with 2 sapporo's each, and by the time we were done, we could barely walk!\n\n<mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> - delicious!!!! the sauce may be just a bit overpowering but delicious nonetheless. i couldnt even taste the jalapeno :)\n\n<mark><mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark></mark> - i have no clue why they are calling this \"ceviche\" but i wish we would have ordered something else instead. it was merely ok,  it just kind of tasted like cold <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> lettuce - but hey, i love <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark>  its all good :)\n\nblack cod <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark> - omg - i just got goosebumps thinking about this dish. it is hands down the best thing i have ever put in my mouth. i like how crunchy <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> it is..  delicioso~\n\n<mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark> roll - your basic roll ..  \n\n<mark>Bento Box</mark> dessert ( flourless chocolate cake with green tea <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark>) yum yum yum yum - this is a great combination - not too much,  shared <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> special is a perfect way to satisfy your sweet tooth.\n\nwill definitely come back - loved the all male service - everyone was really nice and our waiter pretty much gave us his thoughts on all the menu items and gave us some nice suggestions - that in hindsight, i should have taken.\n\n but hey, theyre's always next time!!", 
            "yikes, what happened?\n\nconsistency isn't one of nobu's strengths, apparently, which i believe should be a priority if they are going to charge their customers as much as they do.  i ordered the cheaper $100 omakase again (which i do believe is a good deal given the amount of food you get) but the quality of fish has gone downhill since my last visit.\n\nthe signature hamachi <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark>?  devoid of all velvety tenderness.  the salmon sashimi?  like chewing a rug.  the maguro nigiri?  stringy and tough.\n\non top of it all, i ventured out and tried the <mark>Hamachi Kama</mark>.  not bad, but terrible for $20.  in san diego, you can get the same size <mark>Hamachi Kama</mark> with every bite just as, if not more, succulent for $9.  there is no excuse, honestly.  if you are going to charge me $20, you better make sure not a single sliver of white meat is dry.  half the fish was, but luckily there was dipping sauce to keep the meat from being unbearable to the palate.\n\nnobu isn't a complete loss, though.  like i stated before, the omakase is a great deal, price wise.  it comes with the famed bento dessert, which was even better than i remembered it being last time.  we also tried the miso almond cake and edamame <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark>, which was great in that it was unique and creative (the taste, quite honestly, was *salty*), but it all paled in comparison with the flourless chocolate cake crowned in green tea <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark> that is the bento.  never be tempted to order a different dessert here at nobu.  ever.\n\nsame goes with the black cod.  yes, it's small and yes, it's expensive if you order it a la carte, but it's worth every luscious bite.  it should be a must-order if you come here (it comes with the omakase, but it's so good, you should probably just order another).\n\none item not part of the omakase menu is the uni tempura set.  perhaps the deep frying hides any flaws in the uni, but i could taste that warm sweet flavor that i know is associated with high quality freshness.  gotta love the juicy mushroom and refreshing shiso that comes with it too.  the set is also accompanied with a set of delightful salts, all used to enhance in my opinion, what needs no enhancement.  still nice to look at, though, and they make for some good pictures!\n\ni also tried one of the eponymous sakes and was impressed.  can't remember which one, but the price was reasonable.  wonderfully smooth and paired well with the fish.  i highly recommend that you get it served hot.\n\nwhile i maintain an a-ok for nobu, i doubt i'll be coming back.  there are other places to get better japanese food--and for better prices.", 
            "i only had the sushi so i can't review the hot dishes, so here it goes. the <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> and yuzu was by far the best and the <mark>Nobu Crispy Rice with Big Eye Tuna</mark> <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark> shrimp were good as well, but not worth twice the price of a decent sushi place. i don't know what exactly i was expecting, but this definitely fell short.\n\nalthough the cucumber lychee martini was delicious. i would come back to try the hot dishes if someone else was picking up the tab, otherwise i think pink taco would probably be just as satisfying.\n\noh and i really wasn't that impressed with the decor, why is bamboo so luxe?", 
            "the visit was on a labor day sunday around 6pm.  the last visit to this particular nobu was back in 2003 when i didn't know the difference between a piece of foie and a rubber sole.  i recall having the chef special back then as well, but the omakase this time was definitely more enjoyable.  this was probably due to the fact that i wasn't three sheets to the wind this time.  being married does these things.\n\nthere were those that chose the bronze omakase ($100) and those that went for the silver ($150) like yours truly, and boy was there ever a difference.  there were major discrepancies between the cuts and also the types of meats served.  the sashimi and the speciality dishes also had noticeable differences.  it's not to say that the 100 dollar omakase wasn't good, but it wasn't great...at least from my vantage point.\n\nthere's about a zillion details i will be leaving out, such as the dried flakes of hoo-haa sprinkled with a drizzle of the thinger thang.  so use your imagination..\n\ncourse 1 - a bonito sashimi.\ncourse 2 - amaebi splashed with hot oil, chawan mushi with truffle and crab eggs at the bottom, kampachi sashimi with dried miso flakes.\ncourse 3 - toro sashimi <mark>King Crab with Amazu Ponzu</mark> ginger sauce <mark>Yellowtail and Jalapeno</mark> sauce topped with a bunch of edible flowers which made it all purdy and crap.\ncourse 4 - seared <mark>Scallop</mark> on a bed of sea beans.\ncourse 5 - kobe beef (served medium) with pan fried <mark>Teppan Style Foie Gras</mark>.\ncourse 6 - sushi set (nigiri) <mark>Inaniwa Pasta with Lobster</mark> broth and <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark>.  the set consisted of - toro, abalone, spanish mackerel, eel, tai (<mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark>) and tamago.\ncourse 7 - an array of sweets including <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark>, chocolate looking souffle thing, fresh fruits and other sugary confections we couldn't stay for because we were already late for the friggin cirque du pouffay show.\n\n..\n\nall in all, a great meal.  i enjoyed the silver omakase at matsuhisa better, the wife liked this dinner much better.  definitely a strong 4 star, but nowhere near a five.  the highlight of the meal for me was the foie served over the kobe.  the dish was so luxurious i really was at a loss for words as i was enjoying every delectable bite.  the slice of black truffle in the chawan mushi gives you a big mule kick in the face which was in short, heavenly.  \n\ni was surprised to find that i liked the non sushi dishes better than the raw, but is it such a huge surprise?  we live in cities like la, sf, ny, etc. where quality ingredients are so readily available.  i've had sashimi as good if not better in other restaurants.  most don't serve it with the detail and ingenuity like mr. nobu matsuhisa, but it takes way too much money to surprise this sushi cowboy.\n\ni truly don't mean to sound snobbish, but there's only so many ways to serve up a nice slab of toro.  i'm more impressed these days by the way chefs serve up foie.  and i am totally infatuated with bone marrow.\n\n..\n\ni've said too much.  \n\ni am off to eat.\n\nedit:\n\ni don't know if it was because we were in vegas, but i felt like everything was a bit contrived.\n\n*shrugs*", 
            "after being seated, our table was presented a single drink menu, and left alone for fifteen minutes. our waiter seemed a little miffed when he asked what we were going to start with to drink and i told him that we'd like to see food menus. i found it presumptuous and manipulative to leave us with a drink menu and that much free time. we are in vegas, i know, but when you're willing to pay for a nice meal, i expect a little more tact on behalf of the servers.\n\nour waiter was also very quick to tell us how he thought we should move through the menu, all the while, mispronouncing common japanese dishes.\n\nwe tried a number of different dishes and rolls from the blue fin toro to <mark>Spicy Miso Chips <mark>Nobu Crispy Rice with Big Eye Tuna</mark> or <mark>Scallop</mark></mark>, <mark>Fresh Water Eel</mark>, albacore, and <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark>. everything was... good. not impressive, certainly not memorable... just good.\n\nthe interior of this location was bland. one of my co-workers mentioned that the decoration on the walls looked like large ironing boards, which was a fair assessment. the main dining area was too bright for a comfortable dinner, and had us sitting around the kind of small, wood topped table you might find yourself at while having lunch at your favorite sandwich shop.\n\nthe banana cake <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> cream <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark> was a high note, although the spoonful <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark> that they tried to pass off as a scoop made me feel like i was caught in a scene from american psycho. \n\nfor all the noise i heard about nobu being something special, i left feeling uninspired, and with a reminder to myself why finding those one of a kind, family run japanese restaurants is such a treat.", 
            "if it were only about the sushi, nobu would get 5 stars from me. but, i knock off 2 stars for service. we walked in on a saturday night and got seats at the sushi bar, which is the place to be. we went with our sushi chef's suggestions, which were nobu's <mark>House Special</mark>, including \"new-style sashimi.\" these consist of the best fish, <mark>White Fish <mark>Scallop <mark>Salmon <mark>Oyster <mark>Beef <mark>Yuba Sashimi New Style</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark>, with delicate sauces and garnishes: <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark>, live octopus with a peruvian chili paste, whitefish and salmon <mark>King Crab with Amazu Ponzu</mark> sauce, tuna <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark>-mustard sauce. everything was first-class, including the junmai daiginjo sake.\n\nthen, i ordered the <mark>Bento Box</mark> chocolate cake dessert. we were told it would take 8 minutes to cook. no problem - our bellies were happily full of sashimi. 20 minutes later, however, still no dessert, and we finally were able to flag someone down to check on it. another ten minutes went by. our waiter then came out to tell us there was a mixup in the kitchen and our cake went to another table. he tried to give us a plateful <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark> to tide us over - this didn't go over well, as the last thing we wanted was to eat a plateful <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark> and then a chocolate cake. another ten minutes or so, the dessert came out. it was excellent, but frankly wasn't worth waiting over half an hour for. we ask ed for the check while still eating...took another ten minutes...gave the credit card and another ten minutes went by...waiter came out to tell us the credit card isn't clearing and do we want to give another card? by this point, well over an hour had gone by since dessert was ordered and we just wanted to leave already. \n\nwhen our check finally arrived, they did charge us for the dessert that took over 30 minutes to arrive at our table. when i mentioned this to the server, he took it right off the bill. but i was miffed that i even had to ask - the right thing to do would have been to take it off in the first place.\n\ntoo bad, since up until we ordered dessert we were very pleased with the sushi our wonderful chef served us. even for a saturday night in vegas, the service was unacceptably unresponsive for such a high-end restaurant.", 
            "it was a hit-and-miss experience at nobu in vegas.\n\nhits: <mark>Mixed Seafood Ceviche</mark>, sweet <mark>Shrimp</mark> - <mark>White Fish <mark>Scallop <mark>Salmon <mark>Oyster <mark>Beef <mark>Yuba Sashimi New Style</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark> sashimi, kumamoto oysters <mark>Kumamoto Oyster with <mark>Bone in Ribeye 24oz Nobu Sauce</mark></mark>, <mark>Lobster <mark>Tuna <mark>King Crab <mark>Vegetable <mark>Salmon Nobu Style Taco</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark>, bluefin tuna tartar <mark>Yellowtail or Salmon <mark>Blue Fin <mark>Toro Tartare</mark> with Royal Ossetra Caviar</mark></mark>, and tiradito <mark>Scallop</mark>.\n\nmisses: black cod <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark>, <mark>House Special</mark> deluxe roll, fried mai with sweet butter sauce.\n\npersonal favorites are bluefin tuna tartar and sweet <mark>Shrimp</mark> - <mark>White Fish <mark>Scallop <mark>Salmon <mark>Oyster <mark>Beef <mark>Yuba Sashimi New Style</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark> sashimi. presentation and tastes of these two plates are superb and i have never had before. you will be craving for more after you finish the tuna tartar, which are sized like your pinky; you will keep sucking the shrimp tails to get the last piece out.\n\nthe reason of my miss experience is that we trusted the waiter's recommendations and ordered the cooked food. to be honest, i strongly advise everyone to stay away from the cook food. if you want to be full, go across the street and get a burger after. this place is pricey and you definitely like to spend your money wisely on the right stuff.\n\np.s. i have not had the opportunity to have hamachi jalapeno and cannot offer any comment. however, i know a place in san francisco offers a very similar dish and it was quite good, if not great.", 
            "<mark>Black Cod Miso</mark>, <mark>Black Cod Miso</mark>, <mark>Black Cod Miso</mark> that is all you really need to know. we also had yellowtail shashimi <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> which was very good as well. however, nothing touches the <mark>Black Cod Miso</mark>. cons - the place is very loud. hard rock hotel is the loudest hotel/casino in all of vegas so it is a bit of a given that a place inside would be loud as well. the staff is a bit ridiculous but we just chalked it up to that being part of the show. the staff will try and strong arm you into letting them order for you. just stand your ground and go for what you want. also, they will offer you an $11 bottle of fiji water right off the bat. smile and refuse and get some free tap water instead.\npros - have i mentioned the <mark>Black Cod Miso</mark>? the best thing i have ever had pass my lips. the people watching is top notch really every meal on a vegas vacation should be a dinner and a show. the show at nobu is one of the best. with the spouse swapping to my left and the wrestling over who picked up the check to my 1 o'clock (no kidding a half nelson and a headlock/nuggie was used) i was laughing a majority of the time. some people should not have saki. the food is the main reason this place rocks as, it should be. everything else is just a distraction.", 
            "i spent a week in las vegas at the hard rock hotel for nye this year. it was not my first visit to nobu, so we were very much looking forward to a meal there.\n\nas always, it was fantastic. the cucumber martini was so very refreshing i am still craving it. the yellow tail <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> has the best citrus soy sauce - we actually came back & got a drink & this dish again before we went out another night because it was so good & light. we also had the <mark>Lobster <mark>Tuna <mark>King Crab <mark>Vegetable <mark>Salmon Nobu Style Taco</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark> which were great.\n\nfor hot dishes, we had the rock <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark> <mark>King Crab with Amazu Ponzu</mark> sauce and the black cod <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark>. can you say melt in your mouth? this is the reason i return to nobu again & again.", 
            "ok, so if you know me, you know i love nobu!\n\nit is a small place, the wait staff all look like rock stars, even if they are faking sexy accents (i swear the last waiter i had went from spanish to brazilian to puerto rican throughout the course of the meal, but he was hot, so i didnt mind) anyway, as i said about the malibu location and the san diego location and the la location.. my recommendations are:\n\n    * nobu ceviche tacos\n\n    * yellowfin tuna with spicy miso chips\n\n    * yellow tail <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark>\n\nand pair with conundrum if they have it... or sake.. yum",

            "the hype about the miso black cod is true.  tasty.  melts in the mouth.  $23 for it is reasonable.  however the blue fin toro <mark>Yellowtail or Salmon <mark>Blue Fin <mark>Toro Tartare</mark> with Royal Ossetra Caviar</mark></mark> is not worth $32.  it was good but the price is a little over the top. check attached photo.  i love the <mark>Sea Urchin</mark> and eel but then again \ni really love <mark>Sea Urchin</mark> and eel regardless where i eat them.  our waiter is always disappearing. the busser was more attentive than our waiter.  the experience was just okay for me i guess.  it just makes me appreciate other jap restaurants owned by japanese with japanese waiters more.", 
            "i ate here for a business dinner and sat at one of the tables but ordered omakase from the sushi bar.\n\nmy colleagues and i went big and went with $150 a person so we had high expectations...\n\ni will try my best to remember everything that came out...(not in order)\n\nthe first dish was a salmon trout sahimi with ikura eggs inside.  the fish had some chewy veins in it, and there wasn't any type of sauce on it - i guess we were supposed to enjoy the 2 components together.\n\nthere was a dish of fatty tuna (otoro) on top of a rock salt.  this was unique and the fish was melty\n\nthere was a <mark><mark>Lobster <mark>Miso Soup</mark></mark></mark> type dish that came out that used delicious dashi broth - anyone who understands umami would've enjoyed this\n\nkobe beef with special mayo sauce was good, but nothing spectacular\n\n<mark>Scallop</mark> in a green guacamole sauce was edible, but the balance wasn't completely there\n\nkanpachi <mark>King Crab with Amazu Ponzu</mark> sauce <mark>Yellowtail and Jalapeno</mark> was good too but trendy\n\nin the end, a full platter of sushi came with the trademark \"nobu\" mark on the egg sushi - this was perhaps the most dissapointing.  the fish tasted bland, the rice was somewhat hardened like it was sitting out for a while, and i really would've liked to end the night on a high note but this last platter of mediocre sushi ended the night on a low note\n\nand the bill at the end was not a pretty sight...\n\ni probably will not go back to nobu again unless it's free.  i was just expecting so much more because of all the hype.  \n\nhowever on the plus side the service is excellent - the servers are all very attentive.  and the atmosphere, being inside the hard rock hotel, is hip and lively.", 
            "the food here was amazing! we've heard about nobu from a friend of ours and decided to have our valentines dinner here. our waiter suggested 4-5 dishes for the both of us. so, we ordered the monk fish liver <mark>Yellowtail or Salmon <mark>Blue Fin <mark>Toro Tartare</mark> with Royal Ossetra Caviar</mark></mark>, tuna sashimi, salmon tartar, black cod <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark>, uni and an order of the <mark>Soft Shell Crab</mark> roll for the fiance who doesn't enjoy much raw dishes. the food and not to mention the presentation was incredible. we enjoyed each and every dish. for dessert, we picked the <mark>Bento Box</mark> which includes warm valrhona chocolate souffle cake, shiso syrup, white chocolate sauce and green tea <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark> mmmmmmmmmmmmm. i'm so ready to go back and try more dishes on their menu.", 
            "before the concert started at the hard rock, i had enough time to sit down and have a fabulous dinner. at first i thought that steak might be a good idea, but i love asian food and wanted a great experience. my boyfriend and i walked into nobu, a japanese restaurant. for our first time there, we decided to ask for assistance with the menu, and chose several things from each part.\n\ntheir menu is broken up by sushi, cold, hot and specialties. we decided to go with a little bit of everything.\n\nour favorite was the <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark>, and the crab tempura with their special sauce. their tempura shrimp and <mark>Vegetable</mark> were great also.\n\noverall, for the price of 266 dollars for two people to eat out of a tasting menu, it was a great experience. i can't say much about their food because i have to say that i've eaten better tempura at our local asian restaurant, well being in the box.\n\nalthough their tempura was okay (it was too soft and not crispy at all), their sushi was as close to the guam experience as we could get. it was sweet, done perfect, and the sauces were impeccable.\n\ni honestly didn't feel that their tempura was worth the 200 dollar ticket. that was majority of our bill. i do believe that their signature <mark>Bento Box</mark> dessert was worth 14 dollars. it was creamy, a perfect souffle, and their green tea <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark> was just like home.\n\nif you want something other than tempura for your experience at nobu, it's worth the price tag and the trip. for myself, a good japanese restaurant serves light, crispy, and fluffy tempura the way i've had it in japan and on guam from top japanese chefs. however, this was not the case, unfor<mark>Tuna (Big Eye)</mark>.\n\ni give this restaurant my personal 3/5 stars.", 
            "i don't know about the ny or la counterparts, but......\n\nnobu lv must be the biggest scam in the history of fine dining.  i really wanted to like it because i didn't want to seem like a hater but seriously the decor is so uninspired (surfboards, bamboo, modern-classic clash) and the wait staff doesn't have the same refined elegance or grace as comparably priced restaurants.  just cuz you put on a black t-shirt and black slacks doesn't make it chic and modern -- unless you're steve jobs.\n\nwe had the <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> which was genius -- at least for the accountants.  the live scallop was sour and spicy but just too much of each.  the moi new sashimi special could have been any fish.  the miso cod was tasty and one of the highlights, but was served lukewarm.  the uni tempura dish was also pretty good but you only get 1 piece of uni.  the <mark>Bento Box</mark> and yuzu wasabi <mark>Dessert</mark> were ok too.\n\nwould i dine there if the food was 1/3 the price?  sure.  i just felt like i was getting duped and i wanted to scream out the king ain't wearing any clothes you idiots.  but then i realized between the loud noise of hard rock and the drunken stupor of the crowd , my efforts would be moot.", 
            "ate at nobu in vegas last night and what an amazing experience we had.  we had the omakase experience, started with cold dishes to warm entree to heavy appetizer and finished off with a few of their special <mark>Dessert</mark>.  starters: <mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> sashimi with dried miso, olive oil and yuzu; <mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> and cilantro; <mark>Scallop</mark> and <mark>Black Cod Miso</mark> lettuce wraps; pink snapper with pineapple and tomatoes. for warm dishes: chilean sea bass <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> crust and <mark>Tenderloin of Beef</mark> braised <mark>Kumamoto Oyster with <mark>Bone in Ribeye 24oz Nobu Sauce</mark></mark> on a bed of south american yam; <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark> presented in 3 different sauces.  to finish off the meal, chelf sent a platter of 4 special <mark>Dessert</mark>.  always make room for dessert!!!", 
            "this was my first of many trips to nobu restaurants. the hot and cold dishes are very good and innovative. i could pass on the sushi there as i find it to not be up to par for their prices. my favorite dish there is the <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark>. so simple yet so delicious. the miso cod is also delicious but everyone does that dish. also try their matsuhisa martini. it has ginger <mark>Eel and Cucumber</mark> infused vodka and is very refreshing.\n\ni secretely made it my goal to eat at every nobu worlwide. they need to stop opening new ones because i'm falling behind.", 
            "every detail was covered, from a rich broth of <mark><mark>Lobster <mark>Miso Soup</mark></mark></mark> with clams to lovely service from a friendly server. he was really informative and helped us pick through the menu. the interior is contemporary japanese and beautiful. and the food was fantastic.\n\nwe had a tasty hamachi <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> slices. i've had this dish at other places but nobu slices the jalapenos paper thin and dresses the fish in a fantastic sauce. their rendition also includes a cilantro leaf and i'm a huge fan of the herb. great balance of flavors and quality of fish.\ntuna <mark><mark>Nobu's Moriawase Sashimi Salad</mark></mark>. this is a mountain of crisp salad with the sashimi draped around the base. it's a little technically difficult to eat because i wasn't sure how to get it all in one bite. but the salad was delicious and the tuna was, of course, amazing.\nblue fin toro <mark>Yellowtail or Salmon <mark>Blue Fin <mark>Toro Tartare</mark> with Royal Ossetra Caviar</mark></mark>. i think toro needs to be eaten as sashimi/nirigi or over rice as chirashi. mincing it up seems wrong.\n\nand the highlight was the <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> dish with seven spices and liberal amounts of clarified butter. holy gawd!! this was fantastic!! it was an explosion of flavors in your mouth and utterly, indescribably delicious. they split the <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> in half, cook the meat in large chunks, and then place it back into the shell. it makes for a beautiful presentation yet the tender chunks of meat are easy to remove and eat.\n\ninterestingly, i've been to other nobu restaurants and the menu is strikingly similar. i don't know why, but that seems odd.", 
            "i've read about celebrities going to nobu.  my friend talked about nobu like it was a god of sorts.  when we found out we had a table waiting for us at nobu, i was ready to go and feast myself on its delights.  we ordered: the miso black cod, salmon nigiri, a <mark>Soft Shell Crab</mark> roll, the hamachi <mark>Yellowtail and Jalapeno</mark> appetizer, the <mark>Mushroom Salad</mark>, a vegetarian cut roll, and the tiradito.  to drink i had the cucumber martini.  it was seriously one of the best drinks i have ever had.  it tasted like it was made with lychee vodka, and was smooth, refreshing and not too sweet.  unfor<mark>Tuna (Big Eye)</mark> our positive experience ended there.  after waiting an hour for our table, we had ordered about 15 cucumber martinis and was dying for some water.  we sat at our table and for 9 people, 2 drink menus were placed on the table and then we were ignored.  i glanced at the menus, waited.  our waiter came by and i asked him for waters all around and food menus.  15 minutes go by.  we had no water, and no menus.  finally, we're given 5 menus for 9 people, as he handed me the last menu, he left saying \"we're a little short on menus.\"  we shared our menus and within 3 minutes he was back asking us what we were going to have.  we asked him for some suggestions, and he pretty much just brushed us off.  we finally ordered the hamachi <mark>Yellowtail and Jalapeno</mark>.  before i could order anything else, he rushes off.  the next time we saw him he is dropping of a plate of hamachi <mark>Yellowtail and Jalapeno</mark>.  pretty much the whole night, he just ran off with us halfway through ordering and as a result, we were unable to dine together.  i can only speak for the <mark>Mushroom Salad</mark> and vegetable cut roll.  the vegetable cut roll was pretty good, i mean, steamed <mark>Vegetable</mark>, wrapped in a cucumber wrap, with a little ponzu sauce.  the <mark>Mushroom Salad</mark> was pretty gross.  the mushrooms were varied; trumpets, oysters, shiitake, enoki.  the sauce it was cooked in was sour and as a result made the mushrooms taste bad.  everyone else thought the hamachi <mark>Yellowtail and Jalapeno</mark> were pretty good, and they loved the miso black cod.  everything else, however, they said was mediocre.  mediocreness is ok, if it wasn't coupled with poor service and a $400+ bill.  when the bill came, we inquired about the drinks on the bill as we thought we had taken care of them all at the bar.  his response?  \"no you didn't, but you can just take it out of my tip.\"  i secretly think that everybody raves about this place so much because they don't want to admit they spent that much money on a mediocre experience that you can get anywhere in san francisco for a quarter of the price.  overall verdict:  skip it.  the atmosphere is not really that great, the food isn't really that great, and the service should not be called service.  the pros: the cucumber martini was super good.",

            "i can't believe it took so long for a foodie like me to eat at nobu!  \nwith plans to spend labor day in vegas, i was thrilled with how easy it was to secure an 8pm reservation on the saturday of a long weekend.  economy or vegas?  \n\nboyfriend is a nobu-phile (who isn't, once they've been?) and so insisted that we order the <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> and the kobe on hot rocks, but then gave our server latitude to bring us a few other raw dishes.  every single thing i put in my mouth was outstanding.\nas noted by the legions of yelpers, the <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> blows you away--big, bright, fresh flavors that highlight, not mask, the fish.  \nnext out was snapper with breadcrumbs.  similar to the yellowtail in that it featured fresh fish adorned simply with bold, savory flavors, but with a totally different flavor profile.\nthe third, and final, cold dish was that day's special: toro served with arugula, a truffle oil-infused dressing and topped with fresh truffle shavings.  i was a bit nervous about this dish, having seen it on the menu, because i love truffles in theory but often find them cloyingly rich and heavy, with a sort of artificial after taste.  this dish induced giggles, it was so good (see mastro's review for further discussion).  it also induced an epiphany: i dislike truffle oil for the exact reasons enumerated above but i love fresh truffles.  they have all of the best parts of truffle oil (that intense earthy umami flavor) but without any of the fake, sickeningly denseness.  i know, i know: total white people problem.  \n\nfinally, it was on to the kobe beef on hot rocks.  fun, interactive and tasty as hell.  lots of sauces and spices to choose from, but our favorite was just sea salt and the japanese seven spice.  our waiter (excellent service, incidentally) brought us a 6 oz portion which we finished but couldn't have eaten any more of.  at $27/oz, that's a pricey little entree but definitely a splurge-worthy item if you're looking/able to splurge.\n\nwe rounded things out with cocktails in lieu of wine and i definitely appreciated the relative speed with which the meal moved as we had a comedy show to get to that evening.  i left feeling sated, not stuffed, and already thinking about when i could back to nobu for more.", 
            "so i'm a big sushi fan and this was by far the best i've ever eaten.\n\nthe black cod <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark> is like fish candy, and the yellowfin <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> was probably my favorite dish of the night.\n\ni'd also highly recommend the toro roll if you're into rolls. it was incredible.\n\nthe only dish i didn't care much for was the fried rock shrimp but the overall meal was still out of this world.", 
            "you fancy huh? yes.. i sure am.\n\ni had a super disappointing dinner the night before (classic tasting dinner at michael mina), and needed something to really make it up. \n\ni came here for dinner with a really good friend i hadn't seen in a long time. we had both been wanting to try the famed nobu for soo long, that when we got there.. the menu seemed overwhelming. so, we (ok.. he) decided we should splurge for the omakase menu! and i'm so glad we did. there are too many courses to go over, but the most memorable were the tuna tartar <mark>Yellowtail or Salmon <mark>Blue Fin <mark>Toro Tartare</mark> with Royal Ossetra Caviar</mark></mark>, black cod and the dessert. soo good!!\n\ni'm so glad we went here for dinner.. the service was excellent, the decor was nice, and the food delish!\n\ndefinitely a great date spot.. teehee. :)", 
            "oh nobu, you are definitely deserving of a 4 star review, but alas our server (name withheld) decided that serving us wasn't in his best interests.\n\nnow before i utilize yelp to complain about sub-par service i must document the highlights, because as we know, an amazing kitchen can make up for lacking service.\n\nthe <mark>Black Cod Miso</mark> was a life changer. you owe it to yourself to have this dish.\nalso the <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> was such a wonderful combination of flavors, that honestly, i can't find words to do it justice.\n\nnow as to why nobu earned 3 stars from me instead of 4. our service lacked in every area, inattentive, unwilling to suggest menu items for our group of 5, and at times seemingly spiteful. why did you bring us (2) rock <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark>? it's delicious don't get me wrong, but two? \n\nmaybe the malice was because 2 people in our group were very late, and he was missing out on those <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> tips, or because they couldn't include gratuity? i don't know. but when i'm spending $60-70 per person, i expect a little more.",

            "my buddy and i went to nobu this past friday night at 9:30 for their omasake chef choice tasting menu. we had very few disappointments. they sat us right away at the bar, tables would have been 15 minutes even with our reservations.  lots of good energy in the restaurant, lots of japanese yelling back and forth from the waiters and sushi chefs.  we split a $50 bottle of nonfiltered very fragrant nigori sake cold which was smooth and easy to drink. the small bits of rice at the bottle of the bottle reminded me of red wine sediment as a good thing. \n\nthe first course came out quick and cold. a chilled patty of toro tartar in a soy wasabi sauce topped <mark>Yellowtail or Salmon <mark>Blue Fin <mark>Toro Tartare</mark> with Royal Ossetra Caviar</mark></mark>, served with a baby silver spoon.  it was tender, smooth, rich and melt in your mouth.  the caviar was not memorable.  an a+ start and an expensive dish on their regular menu. next was 4 pieces per plate of thin cut fresh octopus topped with a cilantro leaf, a dot of super hot sauce, finished with citrus, like ceviche.  pretty good.  next was another cold appetizer of rice paper wrapped greens with a piece of raw ebi sweet shrimp, dressed with a fantastic sesame ginger sauce with a fried prawn head on the side.  my buddy especially liked the tempura batter on the <mark>Sweet Shrimp with Fried Head</mark> and the dressing.  i will personally come to your house and kill you if you do not eat the fried prawn head. \n\nthen started the hot plates.  first was the ever famous <mark>Black Cod Miso</mark> cod, a bit too sweet for my buddy but it did not keep us from both licking the plates.  a small piece of tender fish which just went on and on and kept melting in our mouths.  flavor of fish hard to come through past miso and sweetness.  like fish candy in a good way.  my friend said that an improvement would be to torch and crisp up the skin before putting on the sauce which would give some texture contrast and make the dish over the top.  $23 on the regular menu.  next was the beef tenderloin toban yaki style with a shitake and enokitake mushrooms and a piece of thin asparagus in a soy broth. beef very lean, not as melt in your mouth as i would like.  my buddy would have liked a nice piece of ribeye cap instead but who wouldn't.  the dish is served spitting hot on a mini hot plate and when they raise the cover in front of you, the steam envelopes you warmly.  try not to get the grease on you. \n\nnext was the nigiri sushi course of 5 pieces along with a nice clam <mark><mark>Lobster <mark>Miso Soup</mark></mark></mark>. we got a piece of <mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> (mmmm), magura tuna (so tender), yellowtail (yum), clam (a bit tough) and <mark>Sea Eel</mark> which was the most tender fall apart <mark>Sea Eel</mark> i have ever tasted.  the sushi rice <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> fill you to the gills by that point and then they hit you with the dessert which was a bento presentation of a warm flowerless chocolate lava cake with lots of lava and very little cake and a very good not sweet green tea <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark>.   this just put the nail in the coffin.  we were stuffed, but we couldn't stop eating since it was so good.  \n\nthe restaurant closed at 11pm on a friday night, but we will remember the meal for a long time coming.  next time i'm in vegas i plan to make it a point to return and see what the chef choice is at that point in time.  this was the $100 omasake.  the $150 would have <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> some kobe beef and <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> and there.  we were very happy with our choice.  i think the meal was an absolute bargain for the price.", 
            "last night if you ordered the $150 omakase menu they donated $50 to the people in japan. great food for a good cause. the restaurant was packed (on a tuesday night) and the service was perfect. totally attentive and choreographed without being annoying. my husband and i split the $150 omakase for two and ordered two other specials to go along with it and it was a feast. our favorites were the yellowtail special, the lobster (split and restuffed with panko and chili), and the monkfish liver <mark>Yellowtail or Salmon <mark>Blue Fin <mark>Toro Tartare</mark> with Royal Ossetra Caviar</mark></mark>. but it was all good. amazing ingredients, beautiful to look at, and nothing that we could ever come close to making for ourselves at home.",

            "let me preface this review by saying that i'm a huge self-admitted sushi <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> and my husband is peruvian, so nobu seemed a logical choice for our 7th anniversary dinner.  aside from the villainous penny slots  just outside the door, it was the perfect choice. \n\nwe started out with the <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark>.  yellowtail is by far my favorite raw fish and i've had a similar dish at several excellent bay area restaurants, but this was by far the most flavorful rendering of this dish that i've had. the sashimi was also not razor thin which was an awesome <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> bonus (honestly, i've gotten use to the fact that fine dining, particularly in vegas, means small portions and high prices so the amount of fish was a pleasant surprise. \n\nnext, we tried the tiradito nobu style <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> type of halibut like fish.  now, here the fish was razor thin, but came out with a dot of rocoto, a block of rock salt, the traditional lime juice and a side of cilantro.  my husband says this is exactly what tiradito is supposed to taste like, which makes me want to spend significantly more time in peru.  it was amazing.\n\nwe then moved on to the <mark>Black Cod Miso</mark> next and honestly, this was the only part of the meal that i was underwhelmed by.  i know that this is supposed to be the signature hot dish at nobu, but i've had a very similar dish at both morimoto napa and at hyakumi at cesar's palace and the texture of the fish wasn't the melt in your mouth awesomeness that i have come to expect from the dish. the flavor was right on, and if i'd never had black cod before, i would have loved it.  \n\nso, we moved back to the cold dishes and tried the <mark>White Fish <mark>Scallop <mark>Salmon <mark>Oyster <mark>Beef <mark>Yuba Sashimi New Style</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark> salmon sashimi (<mark>White Fish <mark>Scallop <mark>Salmon <mark>Oyster <mark>Beef <mark>Yuba Sashimi New Style</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark> because it's served with ginger, <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> other amazing deliciousnesss that i can't recall right now), finishing off the savory with the toro green onion maki (cut).  they were both amazing. \n\nwhat shocked me was how incredibly amazing the two <mark>Dessert</mark> we had were.  we tried the <mark>Bento Box</mark>, a flourless chocolate cake with house-made green tea <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark>, and this peach cobbler like dish with almond miso crumble and ginger <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark>.  i don't know if anyone else finds some green tea <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark> to sometimes taste vaguely like lipstick, but this <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark> was delicate and a beautiful companion to the rich chocolate cake.  the warm peaches with the crumble and (again not overpowering) ginger <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark> was a highlight of my whole trip to vegas.  (and i'm not really a dessert person)\n\nokay, this review is way too long, and i didn't even mention the impeccable service.  i can't wait to go back and wish there was a nobu in the bay area.", 
            "in a word perfect.  in a few words, unbelievably amazing.  you cannot put more care, soul, and most importantly flavor into the detail of every slice, every sauce, and every delicately placed item on each plate. private label sake is of the best i've had. service was spot on.\n\nmust haves:\n<mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark>\n<mark>Black Cod Miso</mark> lettuce cups\nrock <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark> with creamy spicy sauce\nbroiled yellowtail collar",

            "so obviously if you are going here you know what to expect. we had a great experience. our server was one of the ones who went to open dubai, so we were well taken care of. he did warn us because of our reservation time (10:15p) and kitchen closing (11p), that he was unsure how they would send out what we ordered. so we were prepared. of course, if you are spending nobu money my feeling is the chefs serve until you are done. but that is the only reason for the 4th star, well and another completely over priced wine list. \n\ni have been to nobu next door in nyc, so this was a different experience.\n\nonto the food; we jumped all over the menu but stayed away from the sashimi because that seemed over priced f<mark>Premium Sushi or Sashimi</mark>. we ended up with a few hand rolls that were great because the nori was crispy (which seems tough for other places to pull off). \n\nfrom there we also had the <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark>, as always. then we had the <mark><mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark></mark>, and a couple <mark>Lobster <mark>Tuna <mark>King Crab <mark>Vegetable <mark>Salmon Nobu Style Taco</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark> as well. both good and the <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> great.\n\nmake sure you get the black cod <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark> in lettuce. awesome! just eat it straight away because it comes warm.\n\nif you haven't been, go!",

            "i was skeptical, but nobu delivered. i just finished dinner with a friend of mine and i had to write a review before i forgot the details. let's just get to the chase.\n\nmy friend and i walked in and i asked our server what the best three dishes were. he then recommend these three. i felt like a stuck up food critic requesting the chef hit me with his best shot. but i often do this for restaurants that i've never been to. after dinner, i find myself recommending the same. here's the pro and cons:\n\n1) toro carpaccio- okay, $70 for six pieces of fish can be a little on the steep side, but hey, i had to know what it was about. now i know and here's the scoop. the toro is incredibly delicious. it is amazingly tender, quite possibly the most tender toro i've ever had. the fish alone is a star, but the flavor profile that the chefs prepare is pretty impressive too. capers, truffle shavings, truffle oil <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> dressing over greens really hit the mark. i will say that there was a little too much soy sauce for my taste (that's right, i'm chinese and i'm saying it). i would request they served the sauce on the side, but fear they will substitute excess soy sauce with hate.\n\n2)<mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark>- this was almost my favorite dish of the night had it not been for the sheer flavor of the toro. the yellowtail is served as one would expect from an expensive sushi restaurant: fresh, flavorful, tender and seasoned according. the jalapeno slice was perfect- excellent spice without burning my mouth. i would actually recommend this as a first dish. \n\n3) <mark>Black Cod Miso</mark>- i thought this was a little overrated by the other reviews. cooked to near perfection, the cod was warm inside but seared and slightly crispy outside. the miso glaze wasn't much to look at. for me, it resembled gravy. i've seen others' pictures and theirs looks much nicer. nevertheless, the dish was great. i actually prefer black cod cooked slightly medium, but cooked to the core with awesome texture. sweet miso sauce finished off the dish and made it very enjoyable. \n\n4)<mark>Sea Urchin</mark> sashimi or sushi!!! just order it. \n\nmy friend and i were pretty hungry and ordered other dishes but i must say that they didn't exactly knock me off my feet. overall, many of the other dishes were very good, but just not amazing. here's the list:\n\n-<mark>Salmon Skin</mark> hand roll- thin slices of <mark>Salmon Skin</mark> with gobo, rice and seasoning. nice to have a place serve quality over quantity when it comes to the <mark>Salmon Skin</mark>.\n\n-baracuda <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark>- $40 for six slices of barracuda. very interesting texture as i haven't had barracuda before. the lemon/citrus sauce was a bit too much. again, i see this as how the chef intends the dish to be enjoyed, so i simply eat and keep my comments to myself. \n\nlive scallop- again, great cut of <mark>Scallop</mark>, but nothing special to write home about. it was nice that it was served with muscle in ponzu sauce. \n\n<mark>White Fish <mark>Scallop <mark>Salmon <mark>Oyster <mark>Beef <mark>Yuba Sashimi New Style</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark> oyster- four pieces of kumamoto oysters served ready to enjoy. so you have to eat it the way they prepare the seasoning.\n\ncrispy rice w/ <mark>Nobu Crispy Rice with Big Eye Tuna</mark>- for lack of a better term, it's japanese tatter tots. square rice cubes deep fried served with essentially tuna poke. well prepared, tasty, but nothing special. \n\nall in all, it was a great experience. my general assessment is that nobu serves dishes with strong flavor profiles. not exactly my cup of tea. maybe i'm a fond believer that less is more and that the fish should speak for itself. however, i can appreciate the fact that a chef's dish is his own art. so i eat with an open mind and share my interpretation. hope this helps.", 
            "this place came highly recommended to us by a waiter at another restaurant (thanks for the complete disappointment eduardo!).  these are the dishes i tried:\n\n- <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> - was spectacular!  the flavors of this dish were very fresh and enjoyable\n\n- <mark>White Fish <mark>Scallop <mark>Salmon <mark>Oyster <mark>Beef <mark>Yuba Sashimi New Style</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark> sashimi salmon - was basically thin slices of poached salmon drowning in sesame oil\n\n- albacore sushi - thin slice, nothing special...\n\n- salmon sushi- thin slice, nothing special...\n\n- spicy <mark>Big Eye Tuna Roll</mark>- wasn't spicy and the nori wrap was gummy\n\noverpriced and completely not worth it.\n\nand my new pet peeve - do not wipe the table down to prep for the next customer while i am still sitting at the table waiting for my check.  clearing the table is fine, but seriously?  it's completely rude and i think after we dropped $200.00 and only took up about 45 minutes of their time, they could have waited- especially since there were plenty of empty tables around us.  will never go back.", 
            "nobu should <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> letters to the end of its name: e-n-o.  \n\nthe food here tastes better than mcdonald's but worse than chipotle, but i would rate mcdonald's higher due to it being a better value.  we had the tasting menu <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> sushi.  the <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark>, along with every other cold dish, followed the same formula: raw fish + cilantro hidden underneath a pile of salt. the black cod <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark> and the beef tenderloin tasted like bad halloween candy.  everything was either drenched in salt or drenched in sugar, or both.  the sushi was not inedible, it was on par with the kind of sushi you can get from any two-dollar-sign sushi restaurant.  it's pretty hard to mess up sushi to the extent that they messed up their other dishes, since chefs have less artistic license when it comes to sushi.  then again, it's hard to mess up <mark><mark>Lobster <mark>Miso Soup</mark></mark></mark> and theirs was the worst i've ever had (way too salty).  service was good.  \n\nour bill, including tip, came out to nearly $600 for three people.  so if you want to trick your non-asian friends into believing that their palates lack the sophistication to appreciate expensive asian cuisine, nobu is the place to go.  or sometimes when you're feeling masochistic, you just want to get punched in the face.  that's when you go to nobu.  \n\nthere are many reasons to go to nobu, but edible food is not among them.  if you want good food, there are some great french options in the area, such as le cirque.",

            "we planned to have dinner with our friends who live in vegas on one night of our two night stay there recently. after scouring the restaurant recommendations from my friend, we decided on nobu. sometimes i have to be in the mood for sushi, i don't always crave it like other people i know, so i was worrying about committing to a reservation. i was also worried about having to pay a million dollars (slight exageration; i don't even have a million dollars, and if i did, i would only spend half on wine) for any good wine. (true story, i made the mistake of ordering a glass of wine at the bar in the casino at the flamingo (don't ask) one night and it had me wishing for manischewitz.)\n\nok - back to the matter at hand: nobu has now made me crave sashimi, sushi and all japanese food all the time. not only did the server rattle off, in detail, and totally and completely from her memory, just about every item listed on the menu, but the food was amazing. i die. we had a smattering of everything from each \"category\" and honestly, went a bit overboard, but it was a meal well worth going over board on. \n\nwe dined on:\n\n-edamame\n-<mark><mark>Lobster <mark>Miso Soup</mark></mark></mark>\n-tempura fried rock shrimp <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> type of delicious citrusy, creamy sauce\n-<mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> (out of this world)\n-red <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark> (also, amazing)\n-salmon <mark>White Fish <mark>Scallop <mark>Salmon <mark>Oyster <mark>Beef <mark>Yuba Sashimi New Style</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark> sashimi, which was lightly seared and served with green onion, absolutely delicious\n-<mark>Soft Shell Crab</mark> roll\n-spicy <mark>Big Eye Tuna Roll</mark> (cause, come on, you gotta round out the meal)\n\nthe dessert was good but unremarkable. i'm more about the main event.\n\ncap that <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> amazing gin cocktail that i now forget the name of and two glasses of hellaciously expensive, but delicious, sauvignon blanc, and this is one of the top meals i have had in my little life thus far... \n\nin short, take your gambling winnings to nobu and order everything the server suggests.",

            "this is a review of the groupon deal dinner.\n\nthe skinny: fusion peruvian japanese dishes left me unimpressed (3) service: excellent service despite the disappointing cuisine (5) value: for the groupon, it is still overpriced for what it is. so you can imagine what i have to say about full price ... not worth it (2.5).\n\nso here's the deal. we spotted the nobu groupon for $95/2 person (regularly $150) prix fixe menu and we thought \"how can we pass this up?\".\n\nwe went and were seated prompty. our server was great at giving us time and space to make some decisions on the menu. we ended up getting in <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> to the prix fixe an order of their <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark> to round out the menu. the specials that they offered didn't really appeal - there was a lot of fruit/candied nuts mixed in with sashimi which sounded overly sweet to me so i passed on those.\n\nstarting <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> simple edamame with maldon sea salt (love those flakes!), it was a nice way to start a meal.\n\ncourse 1) <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark>/cilantro (6 slices): this was a good dish but not exceptional. although i have had different versions of this before, this is one of the better renditions given the quality of the fish and the strategically correct amount of heat. my only thing with this dish was the actual slices of sashimi itself - the slices were a bit thin and ragged along the edges which surprised me given the supposed caliber of this place.\n\ncourse 2) selection of nigri (6 pcs) and a california roll (6 pcs): the nigri was okay - the slices of fish were decent sized. i was despondent when i realized that the sushi rice was a little too overcooked and sticky.\n\ncourse 3) rock <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark>: the first bite was good however as we ate, the spicy aioli began to slowly permeate the batter leading to a soggier batter. i think it aioli would have been better served as a dipping sauce rather than dressed on the tempura to retain textural integrity. flavorwise, this was a nice dish and we loved the mixture of chive and togarashi.\n\ncourse 4) miso glazed black cod: candied black cod more like it! overly sweet, the piece of fish was smothered in the sugary sauce which became more unappetizing the more we worked to finish this. i have made this at home using his recipe with 1/2 the sugar and it is much better.\n\ncourse 5) <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark> (<mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> to the groupon): the tempura was okay nothing special. the batter was slightly spongier than what i like. i think it would have been better if the shredded daikon/ginger was provided to us so we could <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> much/little we wanted.\n\ncourse 6) normally this would be <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark> except it was my birthday so i got a molten cake with a tiramisu and green tea <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark>. all of them were very good however there was nothing that really wow'ed me to think that it was exceptional.\n\nperhaps 10 years ago, the level of this fusion cuisine would be considered cutting edge. however time has made his dishes appear quite dated. the signature dishes of rock <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark>/yellowtail jalape\\u00f1o sashimi/miso glazed black cod are easily found elsewhere - one might argue that this location's rendition is rather lackluster considering the price. given the many issues with the dishes mentioned above, i cannot recommend this place given the groupon price let alone full price. although our server was truly exceptional, that doesn't make up for the food. 2.5 rounded up to 3 starred review.", 
            "went in with high expectations, but was deeply disappointed.\n\nlet me preface this review by saying that we went in with a groupon.  yes, nobu is offering a groupon haha!  for $100 you get their most popular dishes for two, including the hamachi <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark>, rock shrimp, miso black cod, plus dessert.  \n\nok, i get that we're groupon customers, i underst<mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> we get treated like second class citizens, so my expectations were adjusted, but they managed to not even meet my groupon expectations.  first of all the portions were way too small.  there were only five thin slices of hamachi to share between two people.  the rock shrimp came out in a nice size bowl, while that's good enough for one person, this is meant for two!  there was also one piece of black cod too to share between two people.  i would say if you do this deal you guys better be very comfortable eating out of the same plate or bowl haha.  \n\ni also must say i'm not generally a big fan of fusion cuisine.  nobu did not change my mind.  these are their most popular dishes, but they feel dated and uninspiring.  perhaps because they've been around for a while and many other places now carry the same things?  the rock shrimp was slathered in this orange color mayo sauce, which reminded me of the walnut shrimp dish so often served in chinese restaurants these days.  the cod had a very sweet miso sauce that kind of ruined the natural flavor of the fish itself.  \n\nnot good value and not a place i would go into looking for high quality and inventive food.", 
            "we were in vegas staying at the hard rock and craving sushi. where else would we have gone to eat? we ordered two signature dishes (yellowtail and cod).. we started with the <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> and cilantro. the jalapenos are an interesting departure from the wasabi we are so familiar with.  i only like a little bit of heat, but i actually wanted more than the thin slices offered.  we each had an order of sunomono (cucumber salad), which were quite large.we ordered the black cod as a hot dish. i would come back in order this again and again and again. we ordered the chef's choice for sushi for two... which was your usual assortment. the tamago was sweet and had the restaurant name seared into the top.  \n\nthe food was very good, the ambience was nice, my asahi was on tap, but you have to leave the restaurant and cross the casino to use the restroom, and the prices were quite high.\n\nyes. i will go again.",

            "i had wanted to try nobu for some time, having heard many good things about it. when i saw the $99 groupon plus the 20% off groupon was offering plus my wife's b'day to celebrate there, i knew the stars were aligned.  could it live up to reputation?\nthe food: the groupon is for a 5 course tasting menu. the meal starts with a pass out of edamame with maldon salt. a very generous portion and an excellent way to start a meal. the first course was yellowtail tuna <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> and cilantro. the tuna was sliced super thin and was in a citrus sauce. it was very tasty and different than yellowtail that i have eaten at my local sushi restaurant. things got even better after that. the next dish was rock <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark> with a creamy spicy sauce. wow, was that good! not like any tempura i have eaten before. very lightly breaded, cooked so the shrimp were soft but not mushy. and the spicy sauce was easily handled even by my gringo palate. a great dish. and a huge portion. by its size, the dish would have been enough for dinner if it was the only thing served. this was followed by the alaskan black cod <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark>. another outstanding dish. the fourth course was the sushi; tuna, fluke and salmon with a california roll. this was the weakest part of the menu - only very good. last course, dessert. i photographed the plate. a beautiful presentation with very tasty treats (and a hand written birthday greeting in chocolate). the food rates 5 stars plus.\nthe service: as soon as we were seated, our server, albert, came by to greet us, explain the tasting menu, and take our drink orders. throughout the meal, he, the busboy, and the food runner were very attentive without being overbearing. they made us feel very welcome. our water glasses were never allowed to go below half full. the table was cleared promptly. the food came out of the kitchen plated beautifully. the service was 5 stars plus.\nthe ambiance: the restaurant is nicely decorated with lots of bamboo. however, the tables for 2 were placed one on top of the other. we were there on a monday night, so the tables were never more than 1/3 full.  but our table was about 6 inches from the next table, which was 6 inches from the next in a line up of 4 tables. if the restaurant were crowded and there were people at the next table, we would have been eating with strangers. not my idea of a celebration/romantic meal. at best, 3 stars for ambiance.\nvalue: $80 for dinner of this quality is the deal of the decade. i would do it again in a heartbeat. but i would never go on a weekend night when the table next to me might be occupied (or i would go with a party of 6 or more - the bigger tables were nicely spaced out).", 
            "this place has gone way down hill and for the price, it is pretty scandalous.  went here last saturday night.  the restaurant wasn't even half full so apparently everyone else already got the memo not to come here anymore.  sidenote:  i'd been here before as well as to two other nobu locations, which is also part of the huge disappointment.\n\nthe sushi portions were tiny.  the rock shrimp was delicious, especially when eaten with the greens (although the server should have told the table to do this since it wasn't obvious to my group so i had to inform them).  the <mark>Spicy Tuna (Big Eye)</mark> on crispy rice was a terrible presentation.  the <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> sashimi was beautiful but boring.  same for the tiny sushi portions we received.  miso cod was still excellent.  but the price considering the portions is just offensive.  all in all, not a great experience and i expect so much more from nobu.  perhaps there's a reason we couldn't get into the caesars location that night.  bottom line:  don't come to this nobu.", 
            "i came back four years later and this place is still so good! so good that i went twice in one week which is very unusual for me especially with all the great places vegas has to offer. the items that stuck out for me were the <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> (simple but omg all the flavors work so well together...and that sauce that it comes with is delicious), <mark>Salmon / Salmon Belly</mark>,  <mark>Black Cod Miso</mark>, <mark>Nobu Crispy Rice with Big Eye Tuna</mark>, <mark><mark>Lobster <mark>Miso Soup</mark></mark></mark>, and the kronuts! and the service was absolutely impeccable!", 
            "i have always wanted to try nobu and finally went! and it was worth the wait let me tell you! we went for my bday and did not have a reservation. we got there pretty early around 5ish so they were able to sit us without a res. our waiter jeffrey was on point. best service. he recommended we start with the <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark>. it was melt in my mouth amazing. i could live off the dish for the rest of my life. lol. it was yellowtail with the right amount of sweetness and spice. we also got the cucumber salad which was pretty good. a lot of the vinegar did go to the bottom of the bowl which made it hard to coat your salad but it was still good. we also had a sear salmon sashimi which i do not remember the name that was excellent. we got spicy edamame, <mark>Beef Kushiyaki</mark>, the black cod <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark> and the wagyu beef gyoza. the cod was really good and highly recommended. the wagyu beef was great with two dipping sauces. we literally could have kept ordering food. we had a couple of nice cocktails as well. \n\nafter dinner they brought us out a plate with happy birthday with a choc cake and green <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark>. we also ordered the whiskey moose. both <mark>Dessert</mark> were to die for and i was in heaven. \n\nwhat a fun place to go. you have people dressed to the max, casual people, people from all over the world that come and eat here. come chow down some amazing eats, listen to some funky music and watch the beautiful people. yes please!"

            "nobu.\n\nwell, what can i say?  i've wanted to go to nobu for a really, really long time.  being in vegas for the weekend, i decided this would be the time to do it. \n\nwe started with an assortment of sashimi.  tuna, mackerel (which was completely delicious) and a couple others .... my brain stopped operating clearly after the mackerel.  then a large platter of raw chilean sea bass with enoki and baby bok choy.  a warm ginger infused mushroom broth was ladled over the fish table side which cooked the melt-in-your mouth, luscious bass ever so gently.  mmmmmmm.\nnext came tempura king crab legs with an accompanying  broth (which had sensational body) poured over the tempura right before eating.  it was amazing.  my husbands eyes rolled back into his head- i thought that he was having a seizure.  then came the spicy <mark>Big Eye Tuna Roll</mark> <mark>Eel and Cucumber</mark> roll.  both good.  but the item that stole the show had to be the uni.  and i mean in a bad way.  so i've never had uni.  i know that is super lame.  but i've been waiting until i was at a really good establishment because i wanted to be sure that i was getting the best uni prepared by competent hands.   my fantasy of being super cool vanished in a swift goopy instant.     eeeeeewwww.\nso it came pureed and then wrapped <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark> 'd.  wow.  well, having always prized myself on being somewhat of an adventurous eater i dove in head first, offering myself as the guinea pig.  big mistake!  i take a bite.  the exterior is nice and crisp.  within an instant my mouth was flooded with velvety toxic sea puke, orange ooze dripping on my plate below.  maintaining composure was very difficult- however, this practice will come in handy once the check comes.\n-abalone wasn't much more pleasant- similar flavor with the texture of chewing on somebody's ear.\nthank god a clever distraction appeared soon thereafter the \"uni incident\".  super thin slices of beautifully marbled raw kobe beef on a large platter with six super hot rocks and an assortment of condiments and seasoning.  so we got to cook our own slices of kobe using our chopsticks as our instruments on the hot rocks.  can we say fun?  i've always wanted to do that.\ndessert sounded cool on the menu but in actuality it didn't taste too hot.  i did like the shiso sorbet though.\n\nthe reason why i have given nobu 4 stars instead of 5 is because the fact that i had to go to the skanky, garish, soulless, death trap that is vegas in order to dine there and because of the price.  even as i am writing this i cannot believe what i am about to say.  i am accustomed to spending 250$ or so on a nice dinner .  in this instance i was prepared to pay around 500-550$.  but for a party of four, with no alcohol bill to speak of and 2 people confessing that they were still hungry upon our exiting, the bill came to 700 big ones.  ouch!  gees- i have to confess feeling mildly nauseas directly afterward.  am i just a cheap ol' broad?  or have i gone and acquired some sort of conscience or something?  something just felt really wrong about that.    i just feel like it was self indulgent and empty.  but, then again, i guess that pretty much sums up vegas.", 
            "this was my first of many trips to nobu restaurants. the hot and cold dishes are very good and innovative. i could pass on the sushi there as i find it to not be up to par for their prices. my favorite dish there is the <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark>. so simple yet so delicious. the miso cod is also delicious but everyone does that dish. also try their matsuhisa martini. it has ginger <mark>Eel and Cucumber</mark> infused vodka and is very refreshing.\n\ni secretely made it my goal to eat at every nobu worlwide. they need to stop opening new ones because i'm falling behind."

            "my first visit to a nobu outpost was about 5 years ago at nobu next door in new york city.  at that point i was still evolving into the foodie that i am today, and for some reason, i absolutely loved the hot spot.  the food was innovative; the atmosphere was exclusive; and snagging a table was a super-heroic feat.  in the years that have passed since, nobu has expanded, and i have also eaten at their nobu 57 in manhattan and the vegas location.  as food culture and my passion for it have evolved, so has my dislike of nobu.  this chain has lost its unique luster, and the quality of the dishes has become a mixed bag.  while some hot and cold courses are better than others, almost anything beats their sushi, which tastes like something ordered from a supermarket's counter.  \n\nmy sushi-fanatic friend and i recently booked a trip to vegas, and her sister had insisted that she try nobu.  i knew that my friend was focused on it, so i went along with the recommendation, though i knew better.  we wound up heading there on our first evening, which at least paved the way for better and better meals as the vacation progressed.\n\nour reservation enabled us to get a table at the crowded spot, and we were immediately seated at a prime location in the center of the dining room.  my friend ordered a glass of sangria, while i opted for a fruity martini, which was so horrifically sweet that i needed to exchange it for a basic glass of sauvignon blanc.  the wine also turned out to be very acidic and not at all similar to the waiter's description.\n\nin terms of the food, we started with two appetizers.  a tiny mound of cool, fresh salmon tartare was immersed in a small bowl of fragrant miso oil and topped with a generous helping of salty caviar.  i am very picky about my tartare, judging it by the amount or lack of flavor it exudes.  this particular version was surprisingly well-seasoned and delicious.  we also sampled one of my favorites - the rock <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark> with spicy sauce.  the succulent fried balls of rock shrimp melted in our mouths, and the spicy mayo sauce <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> a creamy kick. \n\nmy friend stayed firm on our ordering sushi, so we requested the fusion-style <mark>House Special</mark> roll and the <mark>Spicy Scallop</mark> roll.  the <mark>Spicy Scallop</mark> one was pretty flavorful, but their house blend, which included several kinds of fish, had zero taste.  we actually sent it back and did not even bother to order a replacement.\n\nunfor<mark>Tuna (Big Eye)</mark>, i think this restaurant has lost its pizazz, and my friend was not impressed either.  i would really only recommend it for its non-sushi menu items, but even those are inconsistent.",

            "i was in vegas this past weekend for a bachelorette party. and when we found out there was a nobu here (see my nyc review since i had been to that one quite a few times), we had to come! i was in charge of the ordering since no one else from the party had been there. \r\n\r\nthe decor is similar to new york's nobu, but not as big and not as nice. the service is not as good but it's vegas so oh well.\r\n\r\nwe ordered:\r\n\r\npeach martini and lychee martini - very good but strong.\r\n\r\n<mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> and ponzu sauce - this was fucking good. one of my friend's doesn't eat sashimi and she loved this dish. (see below for kristine n's review). they prepared it with about 20 pieces of sashimi on the plate for our big party! it was great!\r\n\r\n<mark><mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> Salad</mark> - of course i had to order this! i love the salad dressing. \r\n\r\nmiso black cod - the cool thing about nobu is that because we had a group of 8, they actually cut the fish in chunks and put them individually on little lettuce wraps so it would be easier to eat. this was fantastic and sweet.\r\n\r\nchilean sea bass w/ mushrooms - the bride-to-be is a sea bass connoisseur and she said this was not chilean sea bass, but just regular sea bass. it was still very good though. yummm.\r\n\r\nsquid pasta - i love the squid pasta here. complimented w/ asparagus. i love asparagus!\r\n\r\nrock <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark> - we choose the butter sauce since the other sauces had been a bit spicy. yummy.\r\n\r\n<mark>Bento Box</mark> - flourless chocolate cake with <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark>. this was better than i remembered from nyc. it's not flourless as in a chocolate bar on a plate - it actually does have a cake - souffle texture to it. it was great, and gooey in the middle. \r\n\r\nmango caramel ice-cream dessert - a light but tasty dessert with caramel bits in it.\r\n\r\none of the girls and i are not big seafood fans, but we loved all the dishes here. (see below for kristine n.'s review!) that tells ya something! everyone thoroughly enjoyed this meal which made me happy because i hoped they would trust my judgement in food. =)\r\n\r\nit was nice because they brought out each dish one-by-one so you aren't stuffing your faces all at once. by the end of the dinner, we felt extremely satisfied but not so full we were going to explode.\r\n\r\nyay, for nobu!!!", 
            "nobu is awesome. i've never been to a nobu before until this past weekend when i was in vegas for a bachelorette party. the decor inside the restaurant was pretty nice. service wasn't too bad, but it could have been a pinch better. felt like our waitress was spread out a little too thin and trying to cover too many tables, but when she was around, she gave us the time and explained things pretty thoroughly.\n\nmy favorite dish of the night was the <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> (i normally don't like raw fish, but this one was freaking awesome!), <mark><mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> Salad</mark> (i normally don't eat fields of green salad, but this was an exception!), miso black cod (very yummy), the <mark>Bento Box</mark> dessert was great (esp the chocolate flourless cake which was very soft) and the mango caramel <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark> dessert. the <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark> was lighted flavored mango and there were caramel bits in there that was just great. probably my favorite dessert that i've ever had.\n\noverall the food was fantastic. definitely would head back to nobu again next time i'm in vegas. they're opening one closeby and i'll be definitely dining there in the future.", 
            "nobu would have gotten the 5th star, except for the loud music, and the decidedly non-intimate seating. my wife and i aren't opposed to answering a question about a dish, but when the folks next to you can lean over and check out what you're eating, well...i understand that that's the place's image, but it just keeps it from being a 5-star dining experience, imo.\n\nwe went on a sunday night at 7:30p. we were seated immediately, and our server brought the drink menus. my wife had the passion mojito, and i stuck with a sapporo because i'm not a huge fan of sake. the drink menu was replaced with the dinner menu, but we were pretty sure we were going to have the omakase.\n\nthere are two basic \"levels\" of omakase...each is composed of a mixture of cold dishes, hot dishes, sushi, and dessert. the lower-priced version ($100) contains more traditional dishes, and the higher priced version ($135) was said to be more \"exotic\". we both opted for the latter. i was trying to listen to the explanation of each dish and then scribble them down, so i likely missed some of the little accompaniments/garnishes. \n\n- kumamoto oyster, on the half-shell, with nobu salsa\n- sweet shrimp (sashimi-style, no rice, and no tempura head)\n- some kind of shellfish sashimi-style (either scallop or clam, i'm leaning towards scallop, based on the texture and the menu offerings)\nall three of these items were served on the same plate, the latter two with, i think, ponzu sauce. the oyster was pretty large, such that i didn't want to pick the shell up and end up wearing some of it. the sweet shrimp was very rich and quite tasty, and what i'm assuming was the scallop was a little firmer than i would expect, but still very good.\n\n- kampachi sashimi with kelp and mushroom \nkampachi is one of my favorite fish, and this did not disappoint. the kelp and mushroom, i think, were kept subtle so as not to overpower the fish...you could actually skip the kelp and mushrooms if you were trying to save room for later. \n\n- new-style unagi (lightly seared) layered with shiitake over a bed of tofu, with uni on the side\nthey have a really good sauce for the uni, because i don't like uni, and this tasted great! :) the unagi was also wonderful when prepared like this, as the meat is very tender, and no powerful marinade.\n\n- toro salad with vegetable spring roll\ni wasn't crazy about the spring roll...i thought it was bland. the toro salad, however, was very good.\n\n- green tea & ume sorbet\ni guess this was a palate cleanser? i wasn't expecting to get something like this in the middle of the meal. after the server brought it out, i told my wife, \"thank you for dining at nobu, please come back soon.\" anyway, it was not overly sweet, and would be fine as a dessert after a big meal.\n\n- broiled snapper over risotto with <mark>Snow Crab</mark> meat, topped with a white truffle chip \nthe hot dishes started with a small chunk of snapper that was done pretty much perfectly, no color, but still very juicy. the risotto was ok, nothing special, but the rice went well with the fish.\n\n- small, sliced, grilled \"kobe\" beef tenderloin with okinawa potatoes served alongside a slice of grilled japanese eggplant topped with a small piece of grilled <mark>Teppan Style Foie Gras</mark>.\ni'm going to commit heresy in a bit...i put kobe in quotes, because i hear a bunch of stories about whether or not kobe is kobe, but this tenderloin was done rare, and the potatoes went nicely with it. great dish. i don't really like eggplant, but this was ok, so they did something right. i'd never had <mark>Teppan Style Foie Gras</mark> before, and, well, meh? there, i said it.\n\n- <mark><mark>Lobster <mark>Miso Soup</mark></mark></mark> with clam\nanother break, like the sorbet. it wasn't bad or anything, but i was getting kinda full, so i almost skipped it. (almost).\n\n- nigiri sampler: oh toro, pink snapper, sardine, <mark>Snow Crab</mark>, <mark>Jumbo Clam</mark>\nthe clam was fresh and crunchy, but the <mark>Snow Crab</mark> was pretty ordinary. this was only the second time i've had sardine nigiri. i like sardine under other circumstances, but for sushi, i think it's just too oily? i couldn't tell the difference between the pink snapper and, say, fresh tai, but it was very firm and tasty. my wife told me the oh toro was awful and that i should consider letting her eat it for me, as she didn't want it to ruin my dinner. i love her very much, but in matters of sushi, she is not to be trusted. :) try the oh toro.\n\n- blancmange (yogurt, in this case) over almond crisp, pomegranate seeds, and assorted frozen berries.\nfull. i almost had to pass on dessert (almost). again, not overly sweet, which is a plus in my book, and the berries and almond crisp combined very well. \n\nthe service was tremendous, as the restaurant has a large waitstaff, so dishes are cleared away promptly, but we were not rushed. our section filled up towards the latter half of the meal, but the staff were able to keep up with no problems.\n\nif you're a fan of this type of japanese food, check it out - it's pricey, but you're in vegas, so live a little!", 
            "if it were possible, i'd give nobu 4.5 stars. \n\nmy sweetie and i spent a few days in las vegas this week and went out to high-profile restaurants every night.\n\nall of the food we ordered was absolutely delicious, perfectly cooked and seasoned.  the sushi and sashimi were served at the perfect temperature, and everything tasted absolutely fresh.  \n\nspicy miso chips w/scallop sashimi\nsquid pasta\nmiso-glazed black cod - (a nobu specialty and the best piece of fish i've ever eaten)\na selection of sashimi and sushi including yellowtail, fluke, salmon avocado roll, <mark>Yellowtail and Scallion</mark> roll.\nflourless chocolate cake <mark>Bento Box</mark> - (as a pastry chef, i'm pretty wary of the whole \"flourless chocolate lava cake\" trend, but this one was fabulous, perfect texture and molten center,  served with white chocolate sauce and green tea <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark>. yum!)\n\ni'd say the prices were quite reasonable as well.  keep in mind this -is vegas, people.  after checking out -many- of the restaurant menus in other hotels i'd say nobu was absolutely less expensive, and there's no way you're going to get better food quality.\n\nthe only half star missing would be for the quality of the service.  the clearing and mise en placing of the table was fabulous, but our waiter was a little too casual.  he seemed almost on the verge of <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> us as \"guys\" or calling my sweetie \"boss\".  nothing wrong with being friendly, but lets face it this isn't a diner.  a little more dignity would have been appropriate.  luckily, the professionalism of the runners made up for it.  \n\nyay nobu!", 
            "i love sushi! every time i'm in a city with a nobu, i try and stop in.  \nyummy cocktails to start - check!\nyellowtail with jalepenos and cilantro - check!\n<mark><mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark></mark> - check!\nan array of awesome sushi - check!\nwaiter who seemed super interested in all the eye candy - check!\nthis place would have had 5 stars, but when you spend $150/ person and have sub par service...well- enough said!",

            "when nobu opened in new york city, it created a sensation.  reservations were nearly impossible to get, and its new interpretation of traditional japanese food was widely praised.  this led to the inevitable branding of the restaurant; nobu can be found all over the globe.\n\nmeal #1: i found las vegas nobu's sushi highly variable.  the overall quality was ok, but some items (e.g., uni) were poor while others (e.g., ankimo) were good.  orange and honey flavored sake was interesting but probably not worth repeating.\n\n\nmeal #2:  since my first meal, i went to nobu in miami beach, sat in the dining room and had the omakase meal.  i enjoyed that a bit more, so decided to give the vegas location another shot.\n\nthe restaurant looks ok, but nothing great.  it's very noisy, in keeping with the hard rock atmosphere.  the crowd is mostly young, but i think anyone would feel comfortable here; i did.  service is pleasant, although all the servers are running around at full speed.\n\nnow, on to the meal:\n\n    * i chose jyunmai daiginjyo sake.  it wasn't bad, but was a trifle harsh.\n    * small japanese spring roll with balsamic vinaigrette reduction.  good.\n    * trio of raw seafood: sea scallop slice, oyster, ama ebi (raw shrimp).  all served with onion and other spices, although each was slightly different.  good.\n    * seared maguro and a slightly strong flavored fish, <mark>Squid 'Pasta' with Light Garlic</mark> chips and a pickled ginger shoot.  a good combination.  very good.\n    * uni (<mark>Sea Urchin</mark>) <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> white fish, served on sliced eggplant.  the uni was seared and was surprisingly delicious.  there was also a tiny river crab, to be eaten shell and all; interesting for the crunch, not the flavor.  very good.\n    * o toro and a spring roll <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> sauce and radish.  the o toro was good but a little chewy, and the strong sauce tended to overwhelm the tuna.  good to very good.\n    * palate cleanser: intensely flavored, sweet/sour mango sorbet, on top of a red granite with little flavor.\n    * service lapse.  up to this point, courses had been timed well.  at this point, i waited for about 15 minutes, with no explanation.  this was a little annoying.\n    * grilled sea scallop on a bed of mushrooms, bits of seafood, and brown rice.  very good.\n    * <mark>Teppan Style Foie Gras</mark> and kobe beef.  a large hunk of <mark>Teppan Style Foie Gras</mark>; good flavor.  kobe beef very good.  overall, very good to excellent.\n    * service lapse: the next course was supposed to be sushi, followed by <mark><mark>Lobster <mark>Miso Soup</mark></mark></mark>.  they reversed the order, and apologized later.  a minor matter.\n    * <mark><mark>Lobster <mark>Miso Soup</mark></mark></mark>.  better than average; good fish stock flavor, not too salty.  very good.\n    * sushi: o-toro (tuna belly), <mark>Shima Aji</mark> (variety of mackerel?), some kind of crab, unagi (eel).  very good.\n    * fruit papillote.  like a crepe.  the raspberry seeds were very distracting.  fair.\n    * honey <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark>.  very strong honey flavor.  strange, but i liked it.  very good.\n\noverall, the meal was good, but not as good as nobu in miami, and not nearly as good as okada.  at the price they charge ($120), they need to do better.\n\n\nmeal #3: based on past meals, i hadn't planned to return. however, i found myself at the hard rock hotel at meal time, and no other choices looked appealing. i decided to go for unusual choices, hoping this would be a strength. this worked out better. my selections:\n\n    * ankimo (steamed monkfish liver). standard but still very good.\n    * <mark>Hamachi Kama</mark> (grilled yellowtail collar). this is a chunk of fish, skin and bone, served grilled. it may not sound like much, and it's a little difficult to get the flesh out, but it's usually very rich and very tasty. i was both happy and sad with my choice: it was very good, but not as good as elsewhere. if you'd like to try this dish, order it robatayaki style at okada.\n    * live shrimp. these santa barbara shrimp were killed in front of me, so i guess that means they're fresh. they were big and rather chewy; i'm guessing the latter is due to their recent demise. the heads were served tempura style, and were juicy and tasty.\n    * live octopus. i'm not sure that it was live, but slices of the tentacle, served raw, were indeed very fresh tasting - and much less chewy than the cooked version. pretty good.\n\nthis was the most satisfying of my meals at nobu. nothing was stellar, but everything was good.\n\n\n\nnobu's strength is its new take on japanese foods.  its weaknesses are sushi that isn't in the same class with the better places in las vegas, and suspect service.  given such high prices, i'd look elsewhere.", 
            "i wish all of my meals in vegas were this good.  i don't even know where to begin.  the yellow tail <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> that i was allowed to taste was delicious.  i could have ordered 5 plates of it alone and been happy with my meal.  thankfully being with the group i was with that wasn't allowed to happen and i enjoyed several other items from the menu.\n\nfor myself i ordered the chilean sea bass with a <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark> rub, the <mark><mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark></mark>, uni nigiri, and scallop sashimi.  the sea bass had a very mild flavor although the <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark> was tasty.  i think grilling sea bass rather than steaming it brings out the buttery flavor that it naturally has much better.  the <mark><mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark></mark> was great and i could have had a couple more but i held off so i could enjoy my entire meal.  the uni was good, although i don't think the wait staff would be able to tell you whether the uni is good that day or not if you asked.  i'm sure the people preparing the meals would just opt not to serve the uni if they happen to not be able to get some good stuff in that day.  at least i hope so.  the surprise of the meal was the scallop sashimi. it was presented beautifully in a little hollowed out lime cup.  with a dash of soy and wasabi the flavor was amazing.  i really should have gotten at least one more order.\n\ni was also able to try some of the tempura rock shrimp, miso black cod, and the wagyu beef.  all were great but the wagyu beef and miso black cod were crazy delicious and will be must order items the next time i eat at nobu.\n\nfor dessert i had the hibiscus sorbet with champagne jelly and rock candy.  the popping of the rock candy (pop rocks) in your mouth with the flavor of the hibiscus sorbet and champagne jelly was more fun than some of the yelp events i've been to.",

            "i really wanted to try nobu after having an amazing experience at morimoto in philly.  i was not disappointed.  we arrived promptly at our reservation time and were seated immediately.  upon being seated we were greeted by our server within moments.    the atmosphere at nobu is much different than morimoto...nobu is more lively and trendy.  \n\nthey have you order a few dishes from the three parts of their menu.  we started with the oysters and the <mark><mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark></mark> which is served in lettuce wraps.  the lettuce wraps were quite good and the oysters were very earthy tasting. \n\nfor our second course we chose the <mark>Creamy Spicy Crab</mark> and the rock <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark> in butter ponzu.  the <mark>Creamy Spicy Crab</mark> may be one of the best dishes i've ever tasted in a restaurant.  at the end of our weekend i asked my brother in law what his favorite thing was about vegas and he responded without hesitation \"eating <mark>Creamy Spicy Crab</mark> at nobu.\"  not the club, not winning $300, not seeing old friends....the <mark>Creamy Spicy Crab</mark>.  \n\nwe chose 4 sushi rolls for our main course, the house roll which is like a rainbow row except the fish on the inside, a spider roll, unagi avocado (not on the menu but they happily prepared it for us) <mark>Yellowtail and Scallion</mark>.  each of the rolls was well prepared and the fish was fresh.\n\nfor dessert we ordered assorted mochi, which caused brother in law to wet himself for the second time that night.  our assortment included tiramisu, pistachio, honeydew, and raspberry.   all were amazing.\n\nthe service was outstanding throughout the night.  the meal was well paced, it wasn't the lingering three hour affair we had at morimoto but we didn't feel rushed at any point.  in the end i felt that the bill was actually fairly reasonable for what we ordered.  including tip and alcohol it came to about $90 a person.  i do have to <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> it did bother me slightly to find that some of the customers were wearing sneakers, open toe sandals (on men) and collarless shirts.  when i made our reservation they informed me that the dress code did not include these things, which is totally fine.  i'm all for getting dressed up to go out to eat, especially in vegas, and especially at a place like nobu, but i do not like it when i go through the effort and others don't have to.", 
            "let me start by saying that the food was excellent.  the reason the place doesn't get 5 or even 4 stars is the service was not on the up and up.  \n\ni went with 5 other guys celebrating a friend's last days as a bachelor.  when we arrived we were told by our waiter that \"we don't have printed menus, but tell me what types of things you like and i'll customize the menu for you\".   odd...  this should have raised a red flag right there.  \n\n\"well, obviously we'd like some sushi.  that's why we're here.\"\n\"any non-sushi eaters?\"\na couple of guys raise their hands...\n\"yeah, bring out a chicken dish or something else non-seafood.\"\n\"okay, i'll get you guys started.\"\n\nthe waiter started bringing out food one platter at a time.  <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> salad...  kobe beef carpacio (something like that)...  some kind of tasty dumplings...  3 complete fillet mignon dinners...  and after a break...  2 huge platters of sushi!!   when all was said and done, we had been brought enough food for probably 10-12 very hungry people!  our \"customized\" menu for 6 people consisted of 5 large platters of food plus 3 complete steak dinners.\n\nwhen we questioned our waiter, his response was \"well that's what you said you wanted.\"  we certainly did not want enough food for 12 people.  by the time the sushi came out, we were all stuffed... and this was a group of 6 guys that can really eat.  of course, we were charged for all of this excessive food that ended up going to waste.  the bill was $1200...  $200 bucks a head.  i don't think i would have had a problem paying $200 for dinner, it was the fact that i had to pay for all this extra food that was unnecessary that bothered me.\n\nto <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> to injury, as we were leaving the restaurant, a table was being seated right in front of us... all the diners had menus in hand.",

            "i've heard various friends praise los angeles's nobu over the years, so after my girlfriend ran the las vegas marathon this weekend, we decided to celebrate <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> first-class sushi.\n\nwe had reservations at 9:00 pm, and we were seated promptly (actually ahead of time, which was nice). my first impression of the restaurant was that it was extremely loud (we were there on a tuesday night), and its location in the hard rock hotel made me groan (it's a bit out of the way, and not necessarily a place i want to poke around).\n\nour waiter, justin, was initially very prompt with our drink orders, but it took 10 minutes (and a reminder) to get glasses of water, and another 10 to get <mark><mark>Lobster <mark>Miso Soup</mark></mark></mark>.\n\nour first course was only half right (we got two dishes, but one was not what we ordered). the servers apologized and took it away. at the rate they were bringing out our food, though, we shuddered to think how long it would take them to bring out the correct dish. for<mark>Tuna (Big Eye)</mark>, it was corrected quickly.\n\nwhen our sushi came out, we noticed another mistake: the <mark>Spicy Miso Chips <mark>Nobu Crispy Rice with Big Eye Tuna</mark> or <mark>Scallop</mark></mark> had been mistakenly replaced with a second order of <mark>Spicy Tuna (Big Eye)</mark>. again, we told them it was wrong and again, they corrected the mistake rather quickly.\n\nservice got to be so bad that after asking a server to hail our waiter (and subsequently having the request ignored), we decided to get the manager over to our table. we were 30 seconds from getting up and leaving (she took another 5 minutes to get to the table) when she came over and heard our story. she seemed as interested in our plight as any manager should and agreed to comp some of our dishes, which was nice.\n\nstill, however, justin's service through the entire night was abysmal (i think we saw him 3 times over an hour and a half), and no amount of manager treatment could save the tip.\n\nregarding the food, it was ok. the <mark><mark>Lobster <mark>Miso Soup</mark></mark></mark> was great. the <mark>Spicy Tuna (Big Eye)</mark> and scallop rolls were anything but (very mild), and the hot/cold mixture of the tuna tempura rolls was a little strange. it was good, but the temperature difference was one of those things that made me wonder, \"is this supposed to be this way and i'm an idiot for thinking this, or is something actually wrong with how it was made?\" judging by the fact that the tuna tempura rolls were one of the dishes they got wrong initially, it could have been that they rushed the order and made it worse. either way, i wasn't really in love with it.\n\nfor the price i [would have] paid, i can't say that the las vegas nobu is really worth it for me again. i've had much better sushi in oakland, for much less.", 
            "if we overlook the fact that the restaurant wrote down our reservation for 10 for the wrong night, my group's dining experience here was exceptional and we were pleased that they were still able to seat us despite this error. the service was incredibly fast (3 people from our group were late and we completely finished our meal by the time they arrived,) and the food was fabulous. the flavors were crisp, unique, and every bite of food was like an explosion in my mouth. since we shared all the dishes we ordered, that pretty much means that we only got one bite so we savored it for all that it was worth. damn you nobu for being so expensive! otherwise i would have ordered 2 of everything!\n\na couple of dishes i would recommend trying are:\n-<mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark>\n-toro tartar <mark>Yellowtail or Salmon <mark>Blue Fin <mark>Toro Tartare</mark> with Royal Ossetra Caviar</mark></mark>\n-black cod <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark>\n-rock <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark>\n-new zealand mussels with the garlic sauce\n\n***the must try dish is the fish/<mark>Lobster <mark>Tuna <mark>King Crab <mark>Vegetable <mark>Salmon Nobu Style Taco</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark>!!!***\nthey are not on the menu here, but you can special order them and they are awesome. i have pictures to prove it.",

            "oh nobu, but the question is, go nobu vegas style?\n\ni hear that this nobu is nothing quite like the other nobus and this is the first nobu i've tried. the fish is great, no doubt about that. the nigiri definitely has an elegant touch <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> which is quite graceful for sushi.\n\nbut i didn't like the feel of this place. then again, this was vegas so what do you expect? the people weren't mean like some have mentioned (maybe if you come in flipflops and mom jeans that might be the case but no one dresses like that in vegas) but i just wasn't diggin the vibe all the much.\n\nnonetheless, the fish still stands as superior to most places, no doubt about that.", 
            "nobu is my favorite japanese restaurant.  ever.  so far i've been to three- this one, nobu malibu and nobu 57 in ny.  out of the three, i'd have to say ny was the best and this one the least-best.  i say \"least best\" because \"worst\" and nobu don't belong in the same sentence together.  you cant go wrong with nobu- but i did have a few gripes about my most recent experience here a couple days ago.\n\nso, of course of course you have to get the miso cod, obvie...not going to spend time describing how fabulous that dish is. in <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> to the cod, i also ordered the lychee martini, the miso eggplant, the <mark>Hearts of Palm</mark> salad with \"jalapeno\" dressing and a <mark><mark>Lobster <mark>Miso Soup</mark></mark></mark>.  if you've read my nobu 57 review, you can see that the lychee martini i had was perfect (which is why i had 3), so understandably i was excited to have it again.  however, the one i received at nobu vegas was waaaaay to strong, and i had to request <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> lychee juice to balance out the rubbing alcohol taste.  my other major gripe was the <mark>Hearts of Palm</mark> salad.  i specifically went out of my way to ask the server if this salad was the same <mark>Hearts of Palm</mark> salad <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> dressing they serve at nobu 57, and he assured me it was.  wrong.  that salad that came out was repulsive- and pretty offensive because of the over-the-top garlic used.  it tasted nothing like the marvelous h.o.p. salad at nobu 57.  and, they should call it \"blast of garlic dressing\" because after one bite i swear i smelled wretchedly of garlic for the rest of the night- and it wasn't spicy from the jalapeno at all.  oh, and not to mention the fact that it was twenty dollars.  um, yea...skip that one.  the miso eggplant was good- not remarkable, but we did eat every last bit of it.\n\nso, even with my complaints i still believe its a 4-star worthy establishment because every one of my previous experiences here have been amazing.  maybe not as good as nobu 57, but still the best japanese restaraunt in vegas, definitely.", 
            "hmmm, good fish, good food...but at what cost? i went here with my cousin and we had a nice meal with the obligatory beers and sake. we each dropped $150, and i left hungry. can i get a \"fuck you?\" it's understandable but annoying as a local when a gourmet chain restaurant charges way more in las vegas than in other cities.\n\ndidn't eat any sushi rolls, instead got some non-roll items like tataki where they basically cut up some fish, splay it out in a circle on a plate all fancy, <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> smattering of scallions, drizzle some ponzu-type sauce atop, and charge you $25. \n\ni guess it's worth it once in a while, but not the kobe beef dish. we'd been told the kobe beef was phenom, so we ordered reluctantly after seeing the price: $20/ounce, 4-ounce minimum. $80 for a small beef dish? yikes! maybe it wouldn't have hurt so much if the beef was good (great would've helped), but nope -- the beef was just some regular-assed beef, not particularly tender or flavorful. i kinda wish i'd used the $80 for something worthwhile, like a tarot reading. at least i would've seen the future, bitches!",

            "fun experience! no privacy...: when we were seated i was disappointed that we were elbow to elbow with other couples on either side- no chance of a romantic dinner (or a private conversation for that matter). at one point the couple next to us leaned over to discuss one of our selections! the place is small <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> crowded. although i frequent japanese and sushi restaurants this menu contained many things i had never had before. most of the items are appetizer sized and quite pricey, considering the size (~$14-25). we chose items off the hot, cold and sushi sections. \nthe yellowtail tartar was great, the <mark><mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark></mark> was not so. the tempura rock shrimp were excellent, just a bunch of fried shrimp on a plate (popcorn-shrimp size). we tried the <mark>House Special</mark> (a rainbow roll) and eel sushi. both were good, but not my favorite rolls i'd ever had-actually kind of plain. for dessert the <mark>Bento Box</mark>, essentially a souffl", 
            "this was the first time ever i've dined with three other yelpers so i'm curious to see where the other reviews come in. personally, four stars is a little high but i really enjoyed three dishes and didn't dislike anything so i'll give it four, albeit unenthusiastically. (i don't think i've ever typed a longer word than \"unenthusiastically\").\n\nthe black cod <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark> was the highlight. the kobe beef was amazing too but we all misread the menu and when that showed up at $192 i'd call it hands down the most overpriced thing i've ever eaten. the <mark>Scallop</mark> topped <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> were the third great dish. the sushi was fine though nothing spectacular.\n\nthe ambiance is surprisingly boring, especially for vegas. it looks the way a japanese restaurant might if designed by the high-school drama department - all cheap bamboo reeds and sloppy wood structures. and the service, though efficient, was humorless. any waitress who can't understand the genius in asking if there are any beef-based <mark>Dessert</mark> off the menu is not winning any points with me.\n\nstill, the price minus the kobe was totally reasonable, especially for vegas. and the matsuhisa martinis go a long way toward <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> up to a pretty good meal.", 
            "very very good. hard to say that it lived up to the hype, but i thought the omakase was good value for $100. i went with my parents and they also ordered the omakase. the waiter tempted us with the $150 omakase containing \"dishes not on the menu\", but being our first time at nobu, we went with the cheaper omakase. the dishes (as best as i can remember from my pics), in order: (cold-hot-sushi-soup-dessert)\n\n1) toro with spicy miso and caviar - wow, definitely one of the highlights of the omakase. super juicy, melt-in-your-mouth toro topped with a bit of caviar and sitting in a nice spicy miso sauce. omg so good. there was an interesting tiny japanese peach on the side to cleanse the palate.\n\n2) hawaiian <mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> sashimi - very nice texture and mix of flavors with the a citrus sauce, spot of spicy sauce, a sprinkle of black sea salt, and . not sure if it's on the regular menu, maybe it's called something else.\n\n3) kampachi and <mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> sashimi - super exotic and tasty. i didn't even know what kampachi was until i looked it up. apparently it's hawaiian yellowtail farmed in the open ocean off the kona coast of the big island. the trout was also very good. it looks a bit like salmon, but tastes a lot better. served with a nice miso-based sauce (i think) on the side, a couple small veggie sushi rolls, a roasted jalapeno, and a small, yellow, pear-shaped tomato sliced in half.\n\n4) black cod w/ miso - this dish really did live up to the hype. i was about to order it separately in case it did not come with the omakase, but our waiter said it is normally included in the $100 omakase since it's a very popular dish. omg so good. such delicate flavors and texture. amazing. i normally don't like to eat fish skin, but this skin is super good and flavorful. the cod is very light and flaky, but not dry. wow, this is a must try if you come to nobu.\n\n5) beef tenderloin w/ shiitake mushroom <mark>Tuna (Big Eye) and Asparagus</mark> - i didn't think this was that special and probably would not order off the regular menu. it was very good tenderloin though, cooked to a perfect medium rare, with a light sauce. it is served in a sizzling mini cast iron plate.\n\n6) nigiri sushi platter - delicious nigiri, super fresh, and most pieces i normally wouldn't order myself, but were interesting to try. tuna (best i've had in awhile), <mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark>, aji, giant clam, and sweet shrimp. mmm\n\n7) <mark><mark>Lobster <mark>Miso Soup</mark></mark></mark> w/ clams - pretty standard <mark><mark>Lobster <mark>Miso Soup</mark></mark></mark> with a few clams inside. the clams and miso is a good combination, but they can be tricky to fish out and eat with only chopsticks. i cheated on one of them and used two fingers to hold the shell. ;p\n\n8) flourless chocolate cake w/ green tea <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark> - a generous portion served in a cute <mark>Bento Box</mark>. nothing too spectacular or interesting, but delicious nonetheless. the cake was still nice and molten inside when it arrived. yum!\n\na pretty filling flight of dishes for $100. i thought it was good value to try many dishes, but i haven't seen the sizes of the normal dishes. many tables around us also ordered the omakase, as i heard the same descriptions being recited by the staff over and over. i over heard a table of french tourists behind us ordering california rolls, chicken teriyaki, tempura, and other generic stuff you can get anywhere. sigh, what a waste.\n\ni would recommend not to order anything not on the \"hot\" of \"cold\" specialty pages of the menu. the rest is basically traditional japanese fare you can get anywhere, but will probably taste better and cost a lot more at nobu. service was good, polite, and attentive. it was a bit odd when our waiter brought out the first few dishes, and then a couple other different guys brought out some of the following ones. weird.\n\nthe decor is basic, but nothing too special. the sushi bar looks cool and there's a pretty wall of bamboo poles at the back as you walk in. my parents like to eat early, so we moved our reservation to 6pm when they are supposed to open. when we arrived a few minutes early, the door was locked and they didn't seem ready yet. ten minutes later, they were ready. better to come early though, or your omakase may take two hours or longer to get through. ours took about 90 minutes because it wasn't that crowded until after 7.\n\ni think the tenderloin and dessert could have been better and more creative. otherwise, nearly flawless.\n\nif i ever return for a special occasion, i will definitely need to try the $150 omakase. with the economy in shambles, i kinda feel bad eating such an expensive dinner. for<mark>Tuna (Big Eye)</mark>, my parents picked up the tab tonight as i had paid last night at the painted pony. maybe in 2009 they will have a recession special, like gray's papaya. ;p", 
            "i'm not going to lie--a small part of me dies every time i think about how much we spent here.  but the truth of the matter is, you can't get good sushi without paying for it.  \n\nwe ordered the $100 omakase, the uni tempura set, kabocha tempura, and salmon sashimi.\n\nthe fusion dishes (like the hamachi <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> or the snapper with cucumber <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Whole <mark>1/2 Maine Lobster</mark></mark> <mark>Roasted Poussin with Spicy Lemon</mark></mark> juice) were fun to try but i find that the sauces often overpower the fish, which is the best thing about nobu.  if you have never tried any of their signature dishes, you might want to order at least one of the omakase options, but if you're just looking to enjoy the fish qua fish, then order the sashimi and/or nigiri a la carte.\n\nand yes, let's talk about the fish.  i have never had such a wonderfully buttery miso black cod!  and the toro, maguro, aji, trout, and sake (as in salmon sashimi) simply melted in our mouths.  no biting necessary.  the only low point was that the anago in our complimentary sushi was littered with small fish bones but hey, it was complimentary!  yet another reason why i love nobu.  they know how to treat the ladies right.\n\nas for the tempura, the kabocha was out of season, so it was our bad for ordering it in the first place, but the uni tempura was unlike anything i have ever had.  every bite was bursting with succulence and the tempura batter <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> extra texture and flavor.  heavenly.  anyone who is a fan of uni and/or tempura needs to try this!  it also comes with tempura shiitake mushroom (luxuriously juicy), tempura shiso leaf (so crispy, so light), and one other <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark> that i forget but that my mom thought was delicious.\n\nthe dessert was lovely too--we had the <mark>Bento Box</mark> which consists of flourless chocolate cake and homemade green tea <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark>.  not too sweet and the perfect way to end a perfect meal.\n\ni seriously cannot wait to come back here again and try the <mark>Hamachi Kama</mark>, the snapper, the whole fried fish, and the squid salad.  is it expensive?  yes.  but is it worth it?  most definitely.", 
            "wow. i was seriously impressed with this place. this place ranks second to french laundry on my list of favorites. \n\nfirst- if you are a first time visitor there, i would recommend just ordering off of the menu. i am sure the omakase is great but you have to try the signature dishes- and you may not get to try them all with the omakase. \n\nsecond- don't have the sushi be your primary focus. it's okay- but the other items are so much better. we saw people around us doing nothing but order sushi- what a waste! \n\nthird- the warm dishes tended to be larger portions than the cold and raw dishes. just a fyi if you want to budget your appetite and your wallet. i also felt that the dishes with a tart factor (see below) were too overwhelming. i would pass on these- imo the tartness is so much you can't enjoy the other flavors that might be there. \n\nwe started with edammame and the sheshito peppers. pass on the edamamme - there is nothing great about it- and you don't need to fill up your tummy with average stuff. the sheshito peppers were really good. they taste like small green bell peppers and the miso and sesame sauce on top has a great flavor. my husband is so picky when it comes to veggies and he even enjoyed this. my only word of caution- occasionally you get a spicy one! \n\nso we relied on our fellow yelpers and ordered the following items: \n\n1. <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> - definitely get this- it was awesome! \n\n2. the blackened miso cod- by far, the highlight of the evening \n\n3. chilean sea bass- cooked the special of the day way (yummy)- it had tomatoes, and onions, some white wine sauce \n\n4. kobe beef on skewers- pass- it was okay but not great \n\n5. <mark><mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark></mark>- pass- the tartness was way too overwhelming \n\n6. red <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark> - pass- again, tartness too overwhelming \n\n7. then we ordered some basic filler items- tempura, sushi (ca rolls and ama ebi)- all which were fine. \n\n8. we ordered the <mark>Bento Box</mark> dessert- it was ok- not fantastic. \n\noverall- the meal was great. the <mark>Black Cod Miso</mark> cod was so good- it had the right blend of sweetness with saltiness, and the fish was so tender it literally melts in your mouth. the chilean sea bass had the same texture and effect, but it costs about twice the amount as the black cod (a tidbit for those of you who are watching the $$s). \n\nwe had starved ourselves earlier in the day and were totally stuffed by the end of the meal. the whole meal with tip was just over $300. i highly recommend this place. it was the only restaurant that we went to in the older part of vegas that was great.",

            "the visit was on a labor day sunday around 6pm.  the last visit to this particular nobu was back in 2003 when i didn't know the difference between a piece of foie and a rubber sole.  i recall having the chef special back then as well, but the omakase this time was definitely more enjoyable.  this was probably due to the fact that i wasn't three sheets to the wind this time.  being married does these things.\n\nthere were those that chose the bronze omakase ($100) and those that went for the silver ($150) like yours truly, and boy was there ever a difference.  there were major discrepancies between the cuts and also the types of meats served.  the sashimi and the speciality dishes also had noticeable differences.  it's not to say that the 100 dollar omakase wasn't good, but it wasn't great...at least from my vantage point.\n\nthere's about a zillion details i will be leaving out, such as the dried flakes of hoo-haa sprinkled with a drizzle of the thinger thang.  so use your imagination..\n\ncourse 1 - a bonito sashimi.\ncourse 2 - amaebi splashed with hot oil, chawan mushi with truffle and crab eggs at the bottom, kampachi sashimi with dried miso flakes.\ncourse 3 - toro sashimi <mark>King Crab with Amazu Ponzu</mark> ginger sauce <mark>Yellowtail and Jalapeno</mark> sauce topped with a bunch of edible flowers which made it all purdy and crap.\ncourse 4 - seared <mark>Scallop</mark> on a bed of sea beans.\ncourse 5 - kobe beef (served medium) with pan fried <mark>Teppan Style Foie Gras</mark>.\ncourse 6 - sushi set (nigiri) <mark>Inaniwa Pasta with Lobster</mark> broth and <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark>.  the set consisted of - toro, abalone, spanish mackerel, eel, tai (<mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark>) and tamago.\ncourse 7 - an array of sweets including <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark>, chocolate looking souffle thing, fresh fruits and other sugary confections we couldn't stay for because we were already late for the friggin cirque du pouffay show.\n\n..\n\nall in all, a great meal.  i enjoyed the silver omakase at matsuhisa better, the wife liked this dinner much better.  definitely a strong 4 star, but nowhere near a five.  the highlight of the meal for me was the foie served over the kobe.  the dish was so luxurious i really was at a loss for words as i was enjoying every delectable bite.  the slice of black truffle in the chawan mushi gives you a big mule kick in the face which was in short, heavenly.  \n\ni was surprised to find that i liked the non sushi dishes better than the raw, but is it such a huge surprise?  we live in cities like la, sf, ny, etc. where quality ingredients are so readily available.  i've had sashimi as good if not better in other restaurants.  most don't serve it with the detail and ingenuity like mr. nobu matsuhisa, but it takes way too much money to surprise this sushi cowboy.\n\ni truly don't mean to sound snobbish, but there's only so many ways to serve up a nice slab of toro.  i'm more impressed these days by the way chefs serve up foie.  and i am totally infatuated with bone marrow.\n\n..\n\ni've said too much.  \n\ni am off to eat.\n\nedit:\n\ni don't know if it was because we were in vegas, but i felt like everything was a bit contrived.\n\n*shrugs*",

            "my first visit to a nobu outpost was about 5 years ago at nobu next door in new york city.  at that point i was still evolving into the foodie that i am today, and for some reason, i absolutely loved the hot spot.  the food was innovative; the atmosphere was exclusive; and snagging a table was a super-heroic feat.  in the years that have passed since, nobu has expanded, and i have also eaten at their nobu 57 in manhattan and the vegas location.  as food culture and my passion for it have evolved, so has my dislike of nobu.  this chain has lost its unique luster, and the quality of the dishes has become a mixed bag.  while some hot and cold courses are better than others, almost anything beats their sushi, which tastes like something ordered from a supermarket's counter.  \n\nmy sushi-fanatic friend and i recently booked a trip to vegas, and her sister had insisted that she try nobu.  i knew that my friend was focused on it, so i went along with the recommendation, though i knew better.  we wound up heading there on our first evening, which at least paved the way for better and better meals as the vacation progressed.\n\nour reservation enabled us to get a table at the crowded spot, and we were immediately seated at a prime location in the center of the dining room.  my friend ordered a glass of sangria, while i opted for a fruity martini, which was so horrifically sweet that i needed to exchange it for a basic glass of sauvignon blanc.  the wine also turned out to be very acidic and not at all similar to the waiter's description.\n\nin terms of the food, we started with two appetizers.  a tiny mound of cool, fresh salmon tartare was immersed in a small bowl of fragrant miso oil and topped with a generous helping of salty caviar.  i am very picky about my tartare, judging it by the amount or lack of flavor it exudes.  this particular version was surprisingly well-seasoned and delicious.  we also sampled one of my favorites - the rock <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark> with spicy sauce.  the succulent fried balls of rock shrimp melted in our mouths, and the spicy mayo sauce <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> a creamy kick. \n\nmy friend stayed firm on our ordering sushi, so we requested the fusion-style <mark>House Special</mark> roll and the <mark>Spicy Scallop</mark> roll.  the <mark>Spicy Scallop</mark> one was pretty flavorful, but their house blend, which included several kinds of fish, had zero taste.  we actually sent it back and did not even bother to order a replacement.\n\nunfor<mark>Tuna (Big Eye)</mark>, i think this restaurant has lost its pizazz, and my friend was not impressed either.  i would really only recommend it for its non-sushi menu items, but even those are inconsistent.",

            "skip nobu if you've been to any other location. the atmosphere was very la and kind of snobby. it's a place to see and be seen and sadly this is applicable to the food as well. the menu was confusing and it almost felt like this was done on purpose in order to force the diner to chose the chef's tasting menu. we decided against it (at $100+ per person, we felt we could do better). we chose the <mark><mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark></mark>, <mark>Nobu Crispy Rice with Big Eye Tuna</mark> tempura roll and the <mark>Lobster <mark>Tuna <mark>King Crab <mark>Vegetable <mark>Salmon Nobu Style Taco</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark> to start. the tacos were insanely delicious and everything hit the mark quite well. these composed the \"cold\" dishes that nobu offers and then we moved on to the hot dishes which included kobe beef tataki style, black cod <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark> as well as some sashimi. the kobe beef was incredible and literally melted in our moths and it's no wonder the cod is a famous dish - it was delicious. looking at the menu now i'm uncertain as to why we felt the way we did, but i remember being less than enthused about dropping a few hundred dollars and not feeling like i got real value from our money. the atmosphere was cold and had it been a little friendlier perhaps we would have felt differently. the food felt like a celebrity chef was overseeing it, but you could tell this restaurant was a chain given how gimmicky everything was. sad because there's such a brand behind this name and they're just not living up to it.",

            "my buddy and i went to nobu this past friday night at 9:30 for their omasake chef choice tasting menu. we had very few disappointments. they sat us right away at the bar, tables would have been 15 minutes even with our reservations.  lots of good energy in the restaurant, lots of japanese yelling back and forth from the waiters and sushi chefs.  we split a $50 bottle of nonfiltered very fragrant nigori sake cold which was smooth and easy to drink. the small bits of rice at the bottle of the bottle reminded me of red wine sediment as a good thing. \n\nthe first course came out quick and cold. a chilled patty of toro tartar in a soy wasabi sauce topped <mark>Yellowtail or Salmon <mark>Blue Fin <mark>Toro Tartare</mark> with Royal Ossetra Caviar</mark></mark>, served with a baby silver spoon.  it was tender, smooth, rich and melt in your mouth.  the caviar was not memorable.  an a+ start and an expensive dish on their regular menu. next was 4 pieces per plate of thin cut fresh octopus topped with a cilantro leaf, a dot of super hot sauce, finished with citrus, like ceviche.  pretty good.  next was another cold appetizer of rice paper wrapped greens with a piece of raw ebi sweet shrimp, dressed with a fantastic sesame ginger sauce with a fried prawn head on the side.  my buddy especially liked the tempura batter on the <mark>Sweet Shrimp with Fried Head</mark> and the dressing.  i will personally come to your house and kill you if you do not eat the fried prawn head. \n\nthen started the hot plates.  first was the ever famous <mark>Black Cod Miso</mark> cod, a bit too sweet for my buddy but it did not keep us from both licking the plates.  a small piece of tender fish which just went on and on and kept melting in our mouths.  flavor of fish hard to come through past miso and sweetness.  like fish candy in a good way.  my friend said that an improvement would be to torch and crisp up the skin before putting on the sauce which would give some texture contrast and make the dish over the top.  $23 on the regular menu.  next was the beef tenderloin toban yaki style with a shitake and enokitake mushrooms and a piece of thin asparagus in a soy broth. beef very lean, not as melt in your mouth as i would like.  my buddy would have liked a nice piece of ribeye cap instead but who wouldn't.  the dish is served spitting hot on a mini hot plate and when they raise the cover in front of you, the steam envelopes you warmly.  try not to get the grease on you. \n\nnext was the nigiri sushi course of 5 pieces along with a nice clam <mark><mark>Lobster <mark>Miso Soup</mark></mark></mark>. we got a piece of <mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> (mmmm), magura tuna (so tender), yellowtail (yum), clam (a bit tough) and <mark>Sea Eel</mark> which was the most tender fall apart <mark>Sea Eel</mark> i have ever tasted.  the sushi rice <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> fill you to the gills by that point and then they hit you with the dessert which was a bento presentation of a warm flowerless chocolate lava cake with lots of lava and very little cake and a very good not sweet green tea <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark>.   this just put the nail in the coffin.  we were stuffed, but we couldn't stop eating since it was so good.  \n\nthe restaurant closed at 11pm on a friday night, but we will remember the meal for a long time coming.  next time i'm in vegas i plan to make it a point to return and see what the chef choice is at that point in time.  this was the $100 omasake.  the $150 would have <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> some kobe beef and <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> and there.  we were very happy with our choice.  i think the meal was an absolute bargain for the price.",

            "not worth the hype. \n\nnobu isn't a japanese restaurant, it's a new age sushi restaurant. they may have borrowed their name from new york, but that's about where the similarities end. \n\nservice was friendly, but brisk. they clearly wanted to get us in and out of there since we were sitting at the bar. \n\nwe ordered <mark><mark>Lobster <mark>Miso Soup</mark></mark></mark>, the four <mark>Kelp Salad</mark> (their version of a seaweed salad), tamago, the chilean sea bass with a dried miso sauce, and chicken teriyaki. the miso was standard, and the tamago was much larger than what i'm used to, but both were good. <mark>Kelp Salad</mark> was a little too fishy for me, but then again, i had my heart set on seaweed salad. both the chilean sea bass and the chicken teriyaki were merely good, but not good enough for the ticket ($45 and $30 respectively) and neither came with rice.\n\nso why the three stars? we just weren't overwhelmed. nobu wasn't an impressive dining experience, and in this town, if you don't have experience, why bother?", 
            "bluf...the dining highlight of my trip to vegas with my girlfriend was our dinner at nobu.  this was my third trip to nobu, each time having had the chef's omakase tasting menu.  nobu's tasting menu is a thoughtfully composed meal served kaiseki-style (sort of a themed meal) that seeks to tie together individual dishes by attributes like taste, texture, and temperature to enhance the overall experience of the meal.  since there isn't a set menu, you select the price point you're willing to pay and the chef and the kitchen staff prepares an appropriate amount of courses using whatever exotic ingredients they deem fit.  we both received 9 courses with sake pairing. \n\nfirst course:  we started with a kumamoto oyster wrapped in <mark>Smoked Salmon</mark> topped with a osetra caviar, served on an endive leaf in an asparagus \"boat\" with accompanied by sweet <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> miso sauces.  a masterful start!  the 5 basic tastes were tastefully and elegantly captured together in a single dish! \n\nsecond course:  shima-aji sashimi served in a tosazu (vinegared sardines) gel\\u00e9e with micro celery and \"sea grapes\" kelp...garnished with pickled turnip.  a great all-around dish, but the pickle turnip was the ingredient that put it over the top!\n\nthird course:  bluefin tuna sashimi topped <mark>Squid 'Pasta' with Light Garlic</mark> pur\\u00e9e and sliced serrano chilies with jalape\\u00f1o emulsion over brown rice salsa.  i love sashimi, but the garlicky goodness and spiciness from the chilies was amazing.  the brown rice salsa was damn tasty in its own right!\n\nfourth course:  <mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> and seared sweet shrimp <mark><mark>Nobu's Moriawase Sashimi Salad</mark></mark> served with m\\u00e2che, peppercorn, <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Whole <mark>1/2 Maine Lobster</mark></mark> <mark>Roasted Poussin with Spicy Lemon</mark></mark> dressing.   another success!  the peppercorns gave it the spicy notes that greatly accented the raw fish.\n\nintermezzo:  a <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark>...a simple yet refreshing palate cleanser that marked the transition from cold dishes to hot.\n\nfifth course:  pan-seared seabass, seasonal mushrooms, and wild ramps served in a <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> sauce.  as much as i loved the seabass, the earthy mushrooms and ramps nearly stole the show in this dish!\n\nsixth course:  grilled wagyu beef with seared <mark>Teppan Style Foie Gras</mark> served over yellow sweet corn and snap peas <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark>-mirin reduction.  the oh-so-tender australian-raised wagyu beef paired nicely with the perfectly seared <mark>Teppan Style Foie Gras</mark>.  \n\nseventh course:  dashi <mark>Inaniwa Pasta with Lobster</mark> and enoki mushroom with japanese greens.  so simple, yet such an incredibly satisfying dish!  they didn't skimp on the lobster, either.  in many ways, this was my favorite dish of the night.\n\neighth course:  a selection of sushi...otoro (fatty tuna), tasmanian sea trout, <mark>Sea Eel</mark>, a fish i can't recall, mirugai (geoduck), and tamago (egg omelet).  i love sushi.  i loved all of these nigiri!\n\nninth course:  shiso (?) panna cotta with strawberry \"caviar\", an understated but very satisfying closer to our meal.  the \"caviar\" was made to resemble ikura or salmon roe and was a very nice, creative touch.\n\nas for our sake, chris (i think that was his name), our lead server, informed us that nobu imports its sake from japan and that it's made especially for nobu.  i'm not an expert, at all, on the finer aspects of sake.  suffice it to say, our pairings were very nice, with subtle, yet interesting differences between each glass and went well with each dish.  chris did a great job all-around job taking care of us.  we had a very leisurely meal, never feeling rushed, but we never had to wait for our next course or glass of sake.  the timing was impeccable!\n\ni'm really not the type of person to toss out superlatives casually, but our meal was arguably one of the best meals i've ever had...at least since i've started yelping!  each dish was memorable and no single dish clearly stood out as the best since they were all outstanding!  it takes a lot of hair-splitting to even pick a dish that was less satisfying that the rest but if i had to pick one, it was the wagyu and <mark>Teppan Style Foie Gras</mark> course...and that was only due to the impression that the accompaniments on other dishes were more exciting than the sweet corn and snap peas.  if you're in vegas for one night and can only eat at one place while you're there, go to nobu and have the omakase tasting menu!  you won't regret it!",

            "let me preface this review by saying that i'm a huge self-admitted sushi <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> and my husband is peruvian, so nobu seemed a logical choice for our 7th anniversary dinner.  aside from the villainous penny slots  just outside the door, it was the perfect choice. \n\nwe started out with the <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark>.  yellowtail is by far my favorite raw fish and i've had a similar dish at several excellent bay area restaurants, but this was by far the most flavorful rendering of this dish that i've had. the sashimi was also not razor thin which was an awesome <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> bonus (honestly, i've gotten use to the fact that fine dining, particularly in vegas, means small portions and high prices so the amount of fish was a pleasant surprise. \n\nnext, we tried the tiradito nobu style <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> type of halibut like fish.  now, here the fish was razor thin, but came out with a dot of rocoto, a block of rock salt, the traditional lime juice and a side of cilantro.  my husband says this is exactly what tiradito is supposed to taste like, which makes me want to spend significantly more time in peru.  it was amazing.\n\nwe then moved on to the <mark>Black Cod Miso</mark> next and honestly, this was the only part of the meal that i was underwhelmed by.  i know that this is supposed to be the signature hot dish at nobu, but i've had a very similar dish at both morimoto napa and at hyakumi at cesar's palace and the texture of the fish wasn't the melt in your mouth awesomeness that i have come to expect from the dish. the flavor was right on, and if i'd never had black cod before, i would have loved it.  \n\nso, we moved back to the cold dishes and tried the <mark>White Fish <mark>Scallop <mark>Salmon <mark>Oyster <mark>Beef <mark>Yuba Sashimi New Style</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark> salmon sashimi (<mark>White Fish <mark>Scallop <mark>Salmon <mark>Oyster <mark>Beef <mark>Yuba Sashimi New Style</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark> because it's served with ginger, <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> other amazing deliciousnesss that i can't recall right now), finishing off the savory with the toro green onion maki (cut).  they were both amazing. \n\nwhat shocked me was how incredibly amazing the two <mark>Dessert</mark> we had were.  we tried the <mark>Bento Box</mark>, a flourless chocolate cake with house-made green tea <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark>, and this peach cobbler like dish with almond miso crumble and ginger <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark>.  i don't know if anyone else finds some green tea <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark> to sometimes taste vaguely like lipstick, but this <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark> was delicate and a beautiful companion to the rich chocolate cake.  the warm peaches with the crumble and (again not overpowering) ginger <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark> was a highlight of my whole trip to vegas.  (and i'm not really a dessert person)\n\nokay, this review is way too long, and i didn't even mention the impeccable service.  i can't wait to go back and wish there was a nobu in the bay area.", 
            "when i criticized morimoto napa for being like a \"vegas restaurant,\" i now realize i was astral-projecting into the future and referring to this one.  chef nobu has a signature, peruvian-influenced style, and it seems to be coupling proper technique and great ingredients with a bunch of overpowering and discordant flavors.\n\nuni tempura is amazingly good, although the price ($16 for one piece) and the questionable accompaniments (the obligatory deep-fried shiso leaf) put it far down the value-for-money l<mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark>.\n\nthe tataki plates of kobe-\"style\" beef are great and totally worth the price.  they're an especially great maneuver for large parties, since the steak is so thinly sliced it's easily shared.\n\nking crab tempura is nicely made but there's way too much acid from the ponzu.\n\nthe same goes for the <mark><mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> Salad</mark>; it's far too acidic, the flavor of the <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> lost.  but the pasta aspect was nice; great texture.\n\nthe black cod <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark> is probably a reverse of the chef's intentions:  it's really miso with black cod.  miso is a tricky ingredient; in this dish it's just completely overpowering; it seems like approach is to simply rub the miso on directly.  that's a risky tactic and it doesn't really pay off; it was hard to get through more than a few bites.  and i *love* miso.\n\nmaki in its various forms are served with -- incredibly -- a side of ponzu sauce.  that's a first for me.  i'm not sure i get the logic behind it.  the special house rolls e.g. with jalape\\u00f1o are tasty enough, but generally the <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> flavors don't complement the fish very well.\n\nthe sushi itself is perfectly made.  the knife work <mark><mark>XO and Jamon Iberico</mark> <mark>Beef <mark>Crab Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> preparation and rolling are impeccable.\n\nnobu is a bit flashy and it's to be expected from a restaurant chain that's co-owned by a celebrity chef and an actual movie star.  it's also to be expected from las vegas.  \n\ni'd certainly recommend nobu for the more traditional fare:  it's essentially authentic and very well-made.  i don't think i'd recommend much beyond that.  japanese cuisine, being one of the greatest in the world, doesn't need fixing or innovation.  nor does it need an <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> side of ponzu sauce.", 
            "so obviously if you are going here you know what to expect. we had a great experience. our server was one of the ones who went to open dubai, so we were well taken care of. he did warn us because of our reservation time (10:15p) and kitchen closing (11p), that he was unsure how they would send out what we ordered. so we were prepared. of course, if you are spending nobu money my feeling is the chefs serve until you are done. but that is the only reason for the 4th star, well and another completely over priced wine list. \n\ni have been to nobu next door in nyc, so this was a different experience.\n\nonto the food; we jumped all over the menu but stayed away from the sashimi because that seemed over priced f<mark>Premium Sushi or Sashimi</mark>. we ended up with a few hand rolls that were great because the nori was crispy (which seems tough for other places to pull off). \n\nfrom there we also had the <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark>, as always. then we had the <mark><mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark></mark>, and a couple <mark>Lobster <mark>Tuna <mark>King Crab <mark>Vegetable <mark>Salmon Nobu Style Taco</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark> as well. both good and the <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> great.\n\nmake sure you get the black cod <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark> in lettuce. awesome! just eat it straight away because it comes warm.\n\nif you haven't been, go!", 
            "this would have been four stars, but the inner kitchen made a serious error.  the decor was natural, grounding, with a slightly modern twist.  the restaurant was too loud, but the noise was voices and the casino a bit.  it would have been much better if it wasn't so loud and you could concentrate on the food.  \n\ni ordered the specialty tasting menu which is a seven course meal that is over a hundred dollars.  i made it known to my server that i eat \"kosher style only fish that have scales and fins, when alive e.g., salmon, tuna, white fish, etc, no shell fish under any circumstances, lard, red meat, or gelatin unless it is seaweed gelatin.\"   \n\nthe hors d'oeuvres, salad, and specialty roles were amazing!  they told stories in my mouth and gave me a unique and exhilarating experience. the warm dishes were good, but the specialty rolls are so much better.  stay away from the basic sashmi and regular rolls.  it wasn't worth it for the price.   \n\nthe fiasco really started when i was given <mark><mark>Lobster <mark>Miso Soup</mark></mark></mark> with shells in it!  that type of error should not happen.  it was a mistake in the kitchen, but the manager was very lucky that i was not allergic.  while she apologized, and asked how she could make it right.  i had to suggest a discount.  i think that it should have been immediately offered.  to the manager's credit she did ask if i had a shell fish allergy, and she did go immediately to talk to the kitchen, but that kind of error is inexcusable to me.  this is especially true given how much i stressed no shell fish and how severe shell fish allergies can be.", 
            "can we say pretentious? \n\nfirst impression: reservation was confirmed via opentable, but somehow the hostess said that our reservation was not there. she looked around (the restaurant was about 10% filled) and hesitated, then said something along the lines of \"i suppose we can seat you anyway\"\n\nwaiter: talked out of his ass. seriously. this guy had no idea what he was saying!!! he tried to sound extremely educated in food once i told him i was a huge fan of nobu and that i had all his cookbooks and loved them all. when describing the <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark>, he said \"and the way the chef prepares the risotto with the wakame and the seaweed....\" hi. wakame is seaweed. \"the mirugai and the giant clam we call geoduck...\" hi. can you be any more redundant? don't try to play fancy foreign word games with me like i have no clue what you're saying. i flashed my best smile everytime he came to word vomit. he had good intentions, but it was borderline offensive that he tried to <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> japanese words as if we didn't know what they meant.\n\npros: the staff is very attentive, very quick to remove finished plates so that the next course can be served. we never had to ask for a refill of water because of how attentive the wait staff was. the food was good, albiet pretentious... (i would never ever pay $30 for five paper-thin slices of hamachi with little slivers of jalapeno and overly acidic ponzu again), the menu was innovative, modern, and divided into clear categories to help you order a little bit of every category. the wait staff is very helpful with describing dishes, recommending dishes, and answering questions you have about the menu.\n\ncons: again, extremely frou frou japnese food. the price is not reflective of the quality of food. $40 for a tiny amount of risotto served in a fancy big plate that looks like a bowl... please. the black cod was not fresh-- it seemed like the miso was attemting to cover up the slightly old taste of the black cod... the ceviche hurt my masseters. i probably made the ugliest little puckerface from the acid in the ceviche $35 tiny bowl of ceviche. i'm fine with paying good money for good food, but honestly, nobu was a let down. if it's tiny portions, at least make them spectacular tiny portions. spectacular it was not.\n\nwe left hungry, and went for a real dinner afterwards. sorry, nobu. maybe we'll try another one of your restaurants, but definitely not las vegas.", 
            "bottom line: best japanese in a town of lots of good japanese.\n\nwhen our new baby turned 2 months old, my husband and i decided it was time for a real, baby-free date. seeing as how i had not eaten sushi for the preceding 9 months, it had been on my mind for a long time. and when i want some serious sushi, there's only one place to go - nobu!\n\nin all actuality, you shouldn't really order off the sushi menu at nobu - it's good and all, but it's about twice as much as comparable sushi at, say, osaka. what you really want is the <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark>, the black cod <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark>, and whatever else your perfectly-attentive-but-not-really-there waiter recommends. \n\nnot sure what else i can <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> hasn't been said already, but if you're willing to spend the money, nobu is awesome. \n\nside note: if you are there early, and have a small party, you can probably find seats in the lounge or at the sushi bar (still full menu). otherwise, make reservations! just because the restaurant isn't all that full when you arrive, doesn't mean that it is not booked.",

            "nobu should <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> letters to the end of its name: e-n-o.  \n\nthe food here tastes better than mcdonald's but worse than chipotle, but i would rate mcdonald's higher due to it being a better value.  we had the tasting menu <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> sushi.  the <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark>, along with every other cold dish, followed the same formula: raw fish + cilantro hidden underneath a pile of salt. the black cod <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark> and the beef tenderloin tasted like bad halloween candy.  everything was either drenched in salt or drenched in sugar, or both.  the sushi was not inedible, it was on par with the kind of sushi you can get from any two-dollar-sign sushi restaurant.  it's pretty hard to mess up sushi to the extent that they messed up their other dishes, since chefs have less artistic license when it comes to sushi.  then again, it's hard to mess up <mark><mark>Lobster <mark>Miso Soup</mark></mark></mark> and theirs was the worst i've ever had (way too salty).  service was good.  \n\nour bill, including tip, came out to nearly $600 for three people.  so if you want to trick your non-asian friends into believing that their palates lack the sophistication to appreciate expensive asian cuisine, nobu is the place to go.  or sometimes when you're feeling masochistic, you just want to get punched in the face.  that's when you go to nobu.  \n\nthere are many reasons to go to nobu, but edible food is not among them.  if you want good food, there are some great french options in the area, such as le cirque.",

            "we planned to have dinner with our friends who live in vegas on one night of our two night stay there recently. after scouring the restaurant recommendations from my friend, we decided on nobu. sometimes i have to be in the mood for sushi, i don't always crave it like other people i know, so i was worrying about committing to a reservation. i was also worried about having to pay a million dollars (slight exageration; i don't even have a million dollars, and if i did, i would only spend half on wine) for any good wine. (true story, i made the mistake of ordering a glass of wine at the bar in the casino at the flamingo (don't ask) one night and it had me wishing for manischewitz.)\n\nok - back to the matter at hand: nobu has now made me crave sashimi, sushi and all japanese food all the time. not only did the server rattle off, in detail, and totally and completely from her memory, just about every item listed on the menu, but the food was amazing. i die. we had a smattering of everything from each \"category\" and honestly, went a bit overboard, but it was a meal well worth going over board on. \n\nwe dined on:\n\n-edamame\n-<mark><mark>Lobster <mark>Miso Soup</mark></mark></mark>\n-tempura fried rock shrimp <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> type of delicious citrusy, creamy sauce\n-<mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> (out of this world)\n-red <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark> (also, amazing)\n-salmon <mark>White Fish <mark>Scallop <mark>Salmon <mark>Oyster <mark>Beef <mark>Yuba Sashimi New Style</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark> sashimi, which was lightly seared and served with green onion, absolutely delicious\n-<mark>Soft Shell Crab</mark> roll\n-spicy <mark>Big Eye Tuna Roll</mark> (cause, come on, you gotta round out the meal)\n\nthe dessert was good but unremarkable. i'm more about the main event.\n\ncap that <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> amazing gin cocktail that i now forget the name of and two glasses of hellaciously expensive, but delicious, sauvignon blanc, and this is one of the top meals i have had in my little life thus far... \n\nin short, take your gambling winnings to nobu and order everything the server suggests.", 
            "i had a great dinner last night. my waiter was very knowledgeable and gave me a great tip on the tacos. i had 1 shrimp and 1 <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> wished i had several more! the chef's special roll, kinda of a rainbow in a seaweed wrap was great! the only slight negative is they are proud of the food $$! all in all-a great spot!", 
            "yesterday, my boyfriend and i dropped in for a late night bite. definitely a fan of the decor and the service. our waitress, misty (name on receipt) was thorough and helpful, taking time to answer all questions and providing suggestions. the rest of the evening staff was equally as attentive and descriptive. awesome team. \n\nnow, food. personally, skip the taco apps, nothing special to note there. the rock shrimp had a bit too much sauce for even that type of dish. do go for the chilean sea bass <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark>. it's perfectly cooked in a buttery-citrusy sauce bed; the <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark> on top <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> texture and will make your mouth water. a dish that is both simple yet complex on its own. also, the <mark>Uni or Oyster Shooter</mark> was absolutely delish, with the right balance of sauce and meat. i had a spicy acai cocktail which was one of the best cocktails i've had in a while!! yum. i was too tired to remember what else we had. wish we came earlier to try the rest of the menu.", 
            "came here for a tasting menu offer.  was not sure what to expect.  generous portion, excellent food, incredible service and a great atmosphere.  they also offer $25 corkage.  the sashimi and <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> melt in your mouth.", 
            "i have to say that i was skeptical at first - i don't like the idea of paying so much at a sushi place. but my boyfriend and i were in vegas with friends so the good company was what brought us in. \n\nfor those who want a simple yes/no - yes, if you're looking for a high end place to try and you enjoy sushi than i think nobu is one of those rare places that's worth it. \n\nour party of 8 didn't really know what we wanted, so our amazing waiter suggested that he could pick out an assortment of dishes based on our budget. at $100 a person, he said he could give us the grand prix. we had dish after dish that included sushi rolls, black cod, \n<mark>Creamy Spicy Crab</mark>, etc. other people have mentioned the black cod - i would just <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> my boyfriend made a comment while eating it that every human should taste this succulent piece of ocean nectar. that cod was that good. \n\none person in our group was vegetarian, and i have to say he was getting some awesome custom dishes! so many options for vegetarians!\n\nthe food was great to say the least. the service was excellent, and the ambiance was lively yet relaxed. there was honestly nothing to complain about. since you're reading this review, i assume you don't mind the price point as long as its worth it. i would tell you that yes, it's worth it.", 
            "this is a review of the groupon deal dinner.\n\nthe skinny: fusion peruvian japanese dishes left me unimpressed (3) service: excellent service despite the disappointing cuisine (5) value: for the groupon, it is still overpriced for what it is. so you can imagine what i have to say about full price ... not worth it (2.5).\n\nso here's the deal. we spotted the nobu groupon for $95/2 person (regularly $150) prix fixe menu and we thought \"how can we pass this up?\".\n\nwe went and were seated prompty. our server was great at giving us time and space to make some decisions on the menu. we ended up getting in <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> to the prix fixe an order of their <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark> to round out the menu. the specials that they offered didn't really appeal - there was a lot of fruit/candied nuts mixed in with sashimi which sounded overly sweet to me so i passed on those.\n\nstarting <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> simple edamame with maldon sea salt (love those flakes!), it was a nice way to start a meal.\n\ncourse 1) <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark>/cilantro (6 slices): this was a good dish but not exceptional. although i have had different versions of this before, this is one of the better renditions given the quality of the fish and the strategically correct amount of heat. my only thing with this dish was the actual slices of sashimi itself - the slices were a bit thin and ragged along the edges which surprised me given the supposed caliber of this place.\n\ncourse 2) selection of nigri (6 pcs) and a california roll (6 pcs): the nigri was okay - the slices of fish were decent sized. i was despondent when i realized that the sushi rice was a little too overcooked and sticky.\n\ncourse 3) rock <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark>: the first bite was good however as we ate, the spicy aioli began to slowly permeate the batter leading to a soggier batter. i think it aioli would have been better served as a dipping sauce rather than dressed on the tempura to retain textural integrity. flavorwise, this was a nice dish and we loved the mixture of chive and togarashi.\n\ncourse 4) miso glazed black cod: candied black cod more like it! overly sweet, the piece of fish was smothered in the sugary sauce which became more unappetizing the more we worked to finish this. i have made this at home using his recipe with 1/2 the sugar and it is much better.\n\ncourse 5) <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark> (<mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> to the groupon): the tempura was okay nothing special. the batter was slightly spongier than what i like. i think it would have been better if the shredded daikon/ginger was provided to us so we could <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> much/little we wanted.\n\ncourse 6) normally this would be <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark> except it was my birthday so i got a molten cake with a tiramisu and green tea <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark>. all of them were very good however there was nothing that really wow'ed me to think that it was exceptional.\n\nperhaps 10 years ago, the level of this fusion cuisine would be considered cutting edge. however time has made his dishes appear quite dated. the signature dishes of rock <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark>/yellowtail jalape\\u00f1o sashimi/miso glazed black cod are easily found elsewhere - one might argue that this location's rendition is rather lackluster considering the price. given the many issues with the dishes mentioned above, i cannot recommend this place given the groupon price let alone full price. although our server was truly exceptional, that doesn't make up for the food. 2.5 rounded up to 3 starred review.",

            "this is a difficult review for me to write - i have regarded nobu matsuhisa as one of the most innovative chefs in japanese cuisine. maybe time is passing by and his '<mark>White Fish <mark>Scallop <mark>Salmon <mark>Oyster <mark>Beef <mark>Yuba Sashimi New Style</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark>' doesn't seem so 'new' anymore? \n\ni've had sushi at the london, dallas, and nyc locations of nobu in the past, as well as the excellent original matsuhisa restaurant in la. my visit to nobu in las vegas did not seem to compare with the others. it was great sushi, to be sure - fresh, quality cuts of fish with well-prepared 'cooked' dishes. the service during my visit was pretty indifferent (we sat at the sushi bar) and the chef we sat in front of only seemed to be going through the paces of preparing food at a restaurant that would be packed with hipsters regardless of the quality or preparation of the food. perhaps the global expansion of nobu has dulled this place - haven't seen a change on a nobu menu in years. sad.\n\nanyway, enough hatin'. i had a great <mark>Creamy Spicy Crab</mark> (excellent dish), lots of sushi - uni, konpachi, unagi, chyu-toro, kani - a portion of nobu's house sake (love the bamboo flasks there), tempura, and the exellent miso-marinated black cod. it was all good. but i'm not sure i'll seek out the lv branch of nobu in the future (it was located in our hotel in vegas). \n\ngiven nobu's prices with its growing 'chain' atmosphere and innovativeness of other places (morimoto, tyson cole's uchi), i can only give nobu-lv 3 stars.",

            "i agree with ming-jou in the fact that i was totally disappointed at this place. i should have also listened to my friend who went there and was really disappointed at their omakase, but being japanese, i wanted to try their food to see what the hype was about.  we had reservations at 9 pm and although we got there earlier, they didn't seat us till then.  it was shockingly a loud place that we often had to yell at each other to talk and even to order.  also, the crowd was much older than i anticipated.  the interior had a nice asian feel to it with bamboos everywhere, even on the ceilings.\n\nfor starters, we had edamame, yellowtail tartar <mark>Yellowtail or Salmon <mark>Blue Fin <mark>Toro Tartare</mark> with Royal Ossetra Caviar</mark></mark>, <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark>.  the menu was vague that we didn't expect any sauce with the tartar, but to our surprise, it came in a sauce with wasabi that was a little spicy.  i wish the menu would have included more details.  we got to order individual tempura items, which was a \"first\" for me.  we ordered shrimp, broccoli, and sweet potato.  the order came with 2 pieces each.  i liked how it came out really hot with light batter.  also, they were generous with their tempura sauce with daikon-oroshi (grated daikon).  most places give you barely enough sauce.  for dinner, we shared the <mark>Sushi Dinner</mark> which came with 8 nigiri and 6 pieces of tekka maki (<mark>Big Eye Tuna Roll</mark>).  the sushi rice tasted old as it was cold and flat, not warm and plump.  also, the rice portion for a nigiri was much more than it needed.  fish seemed fresh, but the rice was disappointing.  that ruined my dinner.\n\nwe decided to try their dessert since we don't usually order dessert at an asian restaurant.  we tried their miso almond cake which was the best part of my meal.  it came <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> caramel glaze and edamame <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark>.  the cake was yummier than i expected.  \n\noverall, it was not as good as i expected but i'm giving 3 stars for the good dessert and the great service.", 
            "having owned nobu's cookbook for years, i was only too excited to finally visit a restaurant of his.

            "i had high expectation coming in and left feeling somewhat unsatisfied.  while i do think nobu is a great sushi place to experience, it's a bit over hyped and is priced accordingly..\n\nthe place was not well lid so we opted for the sushi bar where we could actually see the food.  our sushi chef was cool, attentive, and a superb artisan.  i ordered the omakase ($100) and was pretty happy with the variety of dishes:\n1) toro <mark>Yellowtail or Salmon <mark>Blue Fin <mark>Toro Tartare</mark> with Royal Ossetra Caviar</mark></mark> - this was the highlight dish .. fabulous!\n2) 4 different sashimi dishes - <mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark>, yellowtail and a few others .. exotic varieties, beautifully presented, but a bit overpowered by the sauces .. i left nobu with a very strong ponzu aftertaste\n3) black cod .. good but sooooo overrated.  the sauce was just too strong for this delicate fish.  \n4) tenderloin with shitake and enoki mushrooms - i really regret asking to have this well done.  doh!\n5) 5 different pieces of sushi - ameabi, grilled eel, and a few others .. all were pretty good.\n\nthe waiting service was lacking for a fine dining establishment.  i found that the best waiting services are those that are not very visible but are attentive and will serve your needs before being asked.  nobu's staff, while very nice, was more of the opposite.  you see lots of guys crowding the restaurant but still have to ask and wait for stuffs.  the predominately male wait staffs also makes me wonder how tough it must be to compete for female employees with the local cabarets.\n\nbottom line:  i'm glad i tried nobu.  but, it'll be a long while before i come back especially when there are so many other options there in vegas.",

            "one of by best friends from la was raving about nobu in hollywood so we found ourselves at the hard rock and decided to drop by and have dinner.  the hostesses are friendly, and the servers have great knowledge of the menu items and offer great recommendations.  we decided to order the <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> shrimp salad, seared kobe beef platter, and the <mark>Yellowtail or Salmon <mark>Blue Fin <mark>Toro Tartare</mark> with Royal Ossetra Caviar</mark></mark>.  all great dishes (see my photos), but portion size is small so if you like to eat alot...this is not the place for you!!!  your better off at an all you can eat sushi place!  all in all this is a special place to celebrate a special moment with friends or a significant person!  overall, a great experience!!!",

            "my buddy and i went to nobu this past friday night at 9:30 for their omasake chef choice tasting menu. we had very few disappointments. they sat us right away at the bar, tables would have been 15 minutes even with our reservations.  lots of good energy in the restaurant, lots of japanese yelling back and forth from the waiters and sushi chefs.  we split a $50 bottle of nonfiltered very fragrant nigori sake cold which was smooth and easy to drink. the small bits of rice at the bottle of the bottle reminded me of red wine sediment as a good thing. \n\nthe first course came out quick and cold. a chilled patty of toro tartar in a soy wasabi sauce topped <mark>Yellowtail or Salmon <mark>Blue Fin <mark>Toro Tartare</mark> with Royal Ossetra Caviar</mark></mark>, served with a baby silver spoon.  it was tender, smooth, rich and melt in your mouth.  the caviar was not memorable.  an a+ start and an expensive dish on their regular menu. next was 4 pieces per plate of thin cut fresh octopus topped with a cilantro leaf, a dot of super hot sauce, finished with citrus, like ceviche.  pretty good.  next was another cold appetizer of rice paper wrapped greens with a piece of raw ebi sweet shrimp, dressed with a fantastic sesame ginger sauce with a fried prawn head on the side.  my buddy especially liked the tempura batter on the <mark>Sweet Shrimp with Fried Head</mark> and the dressing.  i will personally come to your house and kill you if you do not eat the fried prawn head. \n\nthen started the hot plates.  first was the ever famous <mark>Black Cod Miso</mark> cod, a bit too sweet for my buddy but it did not keep us from both licking the plates.  a small piece of tender fish which just went on and on and kept melting in our mouths.  flavor of fish hard to come through past miso and sweetness.  like fish candy in a good way.  my friend said that an improvement would be to torch and crisp up the skin before putting on the sauce which would give some texture contrast and make the dish over the top.  $23 on the regular menu.  next was the beef tenderloin toban yaki style with a shitake and enokitake mushrooms and a piece of thin asparagus in a soy broth. beef very lean, not as melt in your mouth as i would like.  my buddy would have liked a nice piece of ribeye cap instead but who wouldn't.  the dish is served spitting hot on a mini hot plate and when they raise the cover in front of you, the steam envelopes you warmly.  try not to get the grease on you. \n\nnext was the nigiri sushi course of 5 pieces along with a nice clam <mark><mark>Lobster <mark>Miso Soup</mark></mark></mark>. we got a piece of <mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> (mmmm), magura tuna (so tender), yellowtail (yum), clam (a bit tough) and <mark>Sea Eel</mark> which was the most tender fall apart <mark>Sea Eel</mark> i have ever tasted.  the sushi rice <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> fill you to the gills by that point and then they hit you with the dessert which was a bento presentation of a warm flowerless chocolate lava cake with lots of lava and very little cake and a very good not sweet green tea <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark>.   this just put the nail in the coffin.  we were stuffed, but we couldn't stop eating since it was so good.  \n\nthe restaurant closed at 11pm on a friday night, but we will remember the meal for a long time coming.  next time i'm in vegas i plan to make it a point to return and see what the chef choice is at that point in time.  this was the $100 omasake.  the $150 would have <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> some kobe beef and <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> and there.  we were very happy with our choice.  i think the meal was an absolute bargain for the price.", 
            "last night if you ordered the $150 omakase menu they donated $50 to the people in japan. great food for a good cause. the restaurant was packed (on a tuesday night) and the service was perfect. totally attentive and choreographed without being annoying. my husband and i split the $150 omakase for two and ordered two other specials to go along with it and it was a feast. our favorites were the yellowtail special, the lobster (split and restuffed with panko and chili), and the monkfish liver <mark>Yellowtail or Salmon <mark>Blue Fin <mark>Toro Tartare</mark> with Royal Ossetra Caviar</mark></mark>. but it was all good. amazing ingredients, beautiful to look at, and nothing that we could ever come close to making for ourselves at home.", 
            "ok, this place is expensive, sure.  if you go and order some maguro, unagi, and a dragon roll you'll probably be disappointed.  but i wanted to see everything they could offer so i did the tasting menu, and it was just plain awesome. \n\ndefinitely a few dishes that i'll remember for some time.  there was this fatty tuna cylinder floating in a mix of soy/wasabe <mark>Yellowtail or Salmon <mark>Blue Fin <mark>Toro Tartare</mark> with Royal Ossetra Caviar</mark></mark> on top that was simply fantastic.  \n\n$175 a person lighter later, and not only was i satisfied but happy to have had the experience of eating here.  absolutely a top notch restaurant in the land of famous chain/celebrity chef restaurants.", 
            "bluf...the dining highlight of my trip to vegas with my girlfriend was our dinner at nobu.  this was my third trip to nobu, each time having had the chef's omakase tasting menu.  nobu's tasting menu is a thoughtfully composed meal served kaiseki-style (sort of a themed meal) that seeks to tie together individual dishes by attributes like taste, texture, and temperature to enhance the overall experience of the meal.  since there isn't a set menu, you select the price point you're willing to pay and the chef and the kitchen staff prepares an appropriate amount of courses using whatever exotic ingredients they deem fit.  we both received 9 courses with sake pairing. \n\nfirst course:  we started with a kumamoto oyster wrapped in <mark>Smoked Salmon</mark> topped with a osetra caviar, served on an endive leaf in an asparagus \"boat\" with accompanied by sweet <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> miso sauces.  a masterful start!  the 5 basic tastes were tastefully and elegantly captured together in a single dish! \n\nsecond course:  shima-aji sashimi served in a tosazu (vinegared sardines) gel\\u00e9e with micro celery and \"sea grapes\" kelp...garnished with pickled turnip.  a great all-around dish, but the pickle turnip was the ingredient that put it over the top!\n\nthird course:  bluefin tuna sashimi topped <mark>Squid 'Pasta' with Light Garlic</mark> pur\\u00e9e and sliced serrano chilies with jalape\\u00f1o emulsion over brown rice salsa.  i love sashimi, but the garlicky goodness and spiciness from the chilies was amazing.  the brown rice salsa was damn tasty in its own right!\n\nfourth course:  <mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> and seared sweet shrimp <mark><mark>Nobu's Moriawase Sashimi Salad</mark></mark> served with m\\u00e2che, peppercorn, <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Whole <mark>1/2 Maine Lobster</mark></mark> <mark>Roasted Poussin with Spicy Lemon</mark></mark> dressing.   another success!  the peppercorns gave it the spicy notes that greatly accented the raw fish.\n\nintermezzo:  a <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark>...a simple yet refreshing palate cleanser that marked the transition from cold dishes to hot.\n\nfifth course:  pan-seared seabass, seasonal mushrooms, and wild ramps served in a <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> sauce.  as much as i loved the seabass, the earthy mushrooms and ramps nearly stole the show in this dish!\n\nsixth course:  grilled wagyu beef with seared <mark>Teppan Style Foie Gras</mark> served over yellow sweet corn and snap peas <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark>-mirin reduction.  the oh-so-tender australian-raised wagyu beef paired nicely with the perfectly seared <mark>Teppan Style Foie Gras</mark>.  \n\nseventh course:  dashi <mark>Inaniwa Pasta with Lobster</mark> and enoki mushroom with japanese greens.  so simple, yet such an incredibly satisfying dish!  they didn't skimp on the lobster, either.  in many ways, this was my favorite dish of the night.\n\neighth course:  a selection of sushi...otoro (fatty tuna), tasmanian sea trout, <mark>Sea Eel</mark>, a fish i can't recall, mirugai (geoduck), and tamago (egg omelet).  i love sushi.  i loved all of these nigiri!\n\nninth course:  shiso (?) panna cotta with strawberry \"caviar\", an understated but very satisfying closer to our meal.  the \"caviar\" was made to resemble ikura or salmon roe and was a very nice, creative touch.\n\nas for our sake, chris (i think that was his name), our lead server, informed us that nobu imports its sake from japan and that it's made especially for nobu.  i'm not an expert, at all, on the finer aspects of sake.  suffice it to say, our pairings were very nice, with subtle, yet interesting differences between each glass and went well with each dish.  chris did a great job all-around job taking care of us.  we had a very leisurely meal, never feeling rushed, but we never had to wait for our next course or glass of sake.  the timing was impeccable!\n\ni'm really not the type of person to toss out superlatives casually, but our meal was arguably one of the best meals i've ever had...at least since i've started yelping!  each dish was memorable and no single dish clearly stood out as the best since they were all outstanding!  it takes a lot of hair-splitting to even pick a dish that was less satisfying that the rest but if i had to pick one, it was the wagyu and <mark>Teppan Style Foie Gras</mark> course...and that was only due to the impression that the accompaniments on other dishes were more exciting than the sweet corn and snap peas.  if you're in vegas for one night and can only eat at one place while you're there, go to nobu and have the omakase tasting menu!  you won't regret it!", 
            "nirvana - pure nirvana. my taste buds were happy, i was very happy. \n\nmy bf too me here (my first trip) for our saturday night dinner. we knew when we walked in that we were having the omakase. i truly cannot pick out one single dish that i liked over the others - every single one was executed perfectly. our waiter was kind enough to write down what we had so we could remember. though he didn't write down the sake pairings we had - every single one of them matched perfectly with the dish. my only sadness with the sake is that i can't buy it anywhere since it is made for nobu (perhaps time to sale it at the restaurant???) \n\ncourse 1: kumomoto oysters, wrapped in <mark>Smoked Salmon</mark> with osetra caviar, served with endive <mark>Tuna (Big Eye) and Asparagus</mark> in sweet and spicy miso sauces (sweet and spicy? oysters? what is not to love?) \n\ncourse 2: <mark>Shima Aji</mark> sashimi served in tosazu gelee with micro celery and sea grapes kelp; garnished with pickled turnip (i'm not normally a turnip fan, but you could serve this to me anytime!) \n\ncourse 3: bluefin tuna sashimi topped <mark>Squid 'Pasta' with Light Garlic</mark> puree and sliced jalapeno, served <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> emulsion over brown rice salsa (okay a truly unique dish - and it was spicy! you know i like spice in my life!) \n\ncourse 4: <mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> trout and seared sweet shrimp <mark><mark>Nobu's Moriawase Sashimi Salad</mark></mark> served with mache, peppercorn, <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Whole <mark>1/2 Maine Lobster</mark></mark> <mark>Roasted Poussin with Spicy Lemon</mark></mark> dressing.

            "let me preface this review by saying that i'm a huge self-admitted sushi <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> and my husband is peruvian, so nobu seemed a logical choice for our 7th anniversary dinner.  aside from the villainous penny slots  just outside the door, it was the perfect choice. \n\nwe started out with the <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark>.  yellowtail is by far my favorite raw fish and i've had a similar dish at several excellent bay area restaurants, but this was by far the most flavorful rendering of this dish that i've had. the sashimi was also not razor thin which was an awesome <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> bonus (honestly, i've gotten use to the fact that fine dining, particularly in vegas, means small portions and high prices so the amount of fish was a pleasant surprise. \n\nnext, we tried the tiradito nobu style <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> type of halibut like fish.  now, here the fish was razor thin, but came out with a dot of rocoto, a block of rock salt, the traditional lime juice and a side of cilantro.  my husband says this is exactly what tiradito is supposed to taste like, which makes me want to spend significantly more time in peru.  it was amazing.\n\nwe then moved on to the <mark>Black Cod Miso</mark> next and honestly, this was the only part of the meal that i was underwhelmed by.  i know that this is supposed to be the signature hot dish at nobu, but i've had a very similar dish at both morimoto napa and at hyakumi at cesar's palace and the texture of the fish wasn't the melt in your mouth awesomeness that i have come to expect from the dish. the flavor was right on, and if i'd never had black cod before, i would have loved it.  \n\nso, we moved back to the cold dishes and tried the <mark>White Fish <mark>Scallop <mark>Salmon <mark>Oyster <mark>Beef <mark>Yuba Sashimi New Style</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark> salmon sashimi (<mark>White Fish <mark>Scallop <mark>Salmon <mark>Oyster <mark>Beef <mark>Yuba Sashimi New Style</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark> because it's served with ginger, <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> other amazing deliciousnesss that i can't recall right now), finishing off the savory with the toro green onion maki (cut).  they were both amazing. \n\nwhat shocked me was how incredibly amazing the two <mark>Dessert</mark> we had were.  we tried the <mark>Bento Box</mark>, a flourless chocolate cake with house-made green tea <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark>, and this peach cobbler like dish with almond miso crumble and ginger <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark>.  i don't know if anyone else finds some green tea <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark> to sometimes taste vaguely like lipstick, but this <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark> was delicate and a beautiful companion to the rich chocolate cake.  the warm peaches with the crumble and (again not overpowering) ginger <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark> was a highlight of my whole trip to vegas.  (and i'm not really a dessert person)\n\nokay, this review is way too long, and i didn't even mention the impeccable service.  i can't wait to go back and wish there was a nobu in the bay area.", 
            "this is the 2nd time i've been to nobu las vegas, the first time was probably 8 years ago and i remember loving the food!  this time, i was underwhelmed and here are the reasons why:\n\n1. <mark>White Fish <mark>Scallop <mark>Salmon <mark>Oyster <mark>Beef <mark>Yuba Sashimi New Style</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark> sashimi isn't really new anymore, it's been around for a dang long time and to be honest, it's kinda played out.  s.b. and i both agreed that the plain sashimi was way better.  one suggestion would be to keep the sauces on the side rather than drowning the delicate fish...\n2. confusing menu - they had filet mignon in about 4 places on the menu, all with cryptic descriptions and different prices - once on the specials, twice on the hot items, and again on the last page.  i asked the waiter what was the difference between them all, and he wasn't able to articulate it.  we settled on the one with uni butter and peruvian potato salad ($50), it was char grilled and tender, but the cabernet sauce was way too sweet.\n3. the format made me think of a deconstructed combo plate, where you pick and choose off of the different menus, but in the end you basically had a combo plate - complete <mark>Chilean Sea Bass with Black Bean, Dry Miso, or Balsalmic Teriyaki</mark> chicken, salad, <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark>!\n\ndon't get me wrong, the food was still very good, but the experience just didn't have the same wow factor.  i guess back in the day, this was kinda revolutionary for a japanese restaurant.  it was high end, high quality, modern ambiance, and modern preparation, but 10 years later, after everyone and their mother has copied this format, it's just common.\n\nback to the drawing board nobu!",

            "i was skeptical, but nobu delivered. i just finished dinner with a friend of mine and i had to write a review before i forgot the details. let's just get to the chase.\n\nmy friend and i walked in and i asked our server what the best three dishes were. he then recommend these three. i felt like a stuck up food critic requesting the chef hit me with his best shot. but i often do this for restaurants that i've never been to. after dinner, i find myself recommending the same. here's the pro and cons:\n\n1) toro carpaccio- okay, $70 for six pieces of fish can be a little on the steep side, but hey, i had to know what it was about. now i know and here's the scoop. the toro is incredibly delicious. it is amazingly tender, quite possibly the most tender toro i've ever had. the fish alone is a star, but the flavor profile that the chefs prepare is pretty impressive too. capers, truffle shavings, truffle oil <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> dressing over greens really hit the mark. i will say that there was a little too much soy sauce for my taste (that's right, i'm chinese and i'm saying it). i would request they served the sauce on the side, but fear they will substitute excess soy sauce with hate.\n\n2)<mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark>- this was almost my favorite dish of the night had it not been for the sheer flavor of the toro. the yellowtail is served as one would expect from an expensive sushi restaurant: fresh, flavorful, tender and seasoned according. the jalapeno slice was perfect- excellent spice without burning my mouth. i would actually recommend this as a first dish. \n\n3) <mark>Black Cod Miso</mark>- i thought this was a little overrated by the other reviews. cooked to near perfection, the cod was warm inside but seared and slightly crispy outside. the miso glaze wasn't much to look at. for me, it resembled gravy. i've seen others' pictures and theirs looks much nicer. nevertheless, the dish was great. i actually prefer black cod cooked slightly medium, but cooked to the core with awesome texture. sweet miso sauce finished off the dish and made it very enjoyable. \n\n4)<mark>Sea Urchin</mark> sashimi or sushi!!! just order it. \n\nmy friend and i were pretty hungry and ordered other dishes but i must say that they didn't exactly knock me off my feet. overall, many of the other dishes were very good, but just not amazing. here's the list:\n\n-<mark>Salmon Skin</mark> hand roll- thin slices of <mark>Salmon Skin</mark> with gobo, rice and seasoning. nice to have a place serve quality over quantity when it comes to the <mark>Salmon Skin</mark>.\n\n-baracuda <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark>- $40 for six slices of barracuda. very interesting texture as i haven't had barracuda before. the lemon/citrus sauce was a bit too much. again, i see this as how the chef intends the dish to be enjoyed, so i simply eat and keep my comments to myself. \n\nlive scallop- again, great cut of <mark>Scallop</mark>, but nothing special to write home about. it was nice that it was served with muscle in ponzu sauce. \n\n<mark>White Fish <mark>Scallop <mark>Salmon <mark>Oyster <mark>Beef <mark>Yuba Sashimi New Style</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark> oyster- four pieces of kumamoto oysters served ready to enjoy. so you have to eat it the way they prepare the seasoning.\n\ncrispy rice w/ <mark>Nobu Crispy Rice with Big Eye Tuna</mark>- for lack of a better term, it's japanese tatter tots. square rice cubes deep fried served with essentially tuna poke. well prepared, tasty, but nothing special. \n\nall in all, it was a great experience. my general assessment is that nobu serves dishes with strong flavor profiles. not exactly my cup of tea. maybe i'm a fond believer that less is more and that the fish should speak for itself. however, i can appreciate the fact that a chef's dish is his own art. so i eat with an open mind and share my interpretation. hope this helps.",

(true story, i made the mistake of ordering a glass of wine at the bar in the casino at the flamingo (don't ask) one night and it had me wishing for manischewitz.)\n\nok - back to the matter at hand: nobu has now made me crave sashimi, sushi and all japanese food all the time. not only did the server rattle off, in detail, and totally and completely from her memory, just about every item listed on the menu, but the food was amazing. i die. we had a smattering of everything from each \"category\" and honestly, went a bit overboard, but it was a meal well worth going over board on. \n\nwe dined on:\n\n-edamame\n-<mark><mark>Lobster <mark>Miso Soup</mark></mark></mark>\n-tempura fried rock shrimp <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> type of delicious citrusy, creamy sauce\n-<mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> (out of this world)\n-red <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark> (also, amazing)\n-salmon <mark>White Fish <mark>Scallop <mark>Salmon <mark>Oyster <mark>Beef <mark>Yuba Sashimi New Style</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark> sashimi, which was lightly seared and served with green onion, absolutely delicious\n-<mark>Soft Shell Crab</mark> roll\n-spicy <mark>Big Eye Tuna Roll</mark> (cause, come on, you gotta round out the meal)\n\nthe dessert was good but unremarkable. i'm more about the main event.\n\ncap that <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> amazing gin cocktail that i now forget the name of and two glasses of hellaciously expensive, but delicious, sauvignon blanc, and this is one of the top meals i have had in my little life thus far... \n\nin short, take your gambling winnings to nobu and order everything the server suggests.",

            "several different nobu locations worldwide and the us. this nobu is located inside hard rock hotel - the first one in vegas (and the better one). i had one of my birthday celebrations here.\n\nwe got <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark>, <mark>Nobu Crispy Rice with Big Eye Tuna</mark> tataki <mark>King Crab with Amazu Ponzu</mark>, chocolate banana martini, lychee martini, <mark><mark>Nobu's Moriawase Sashimi Salad</mark></mark>, <mark>Shrimp or <mark>Scallop</mark> with Wasabi Pepper or Spicy Garlic</mark> sauce, <mark>Tenderloin of Beef</mark> toban yaki, nobu's <mark>House Special</mark>, <mark>Salmon Skin</mark> handroll, kulfi and my birthday \"<mark>Bento Box</mark>\".\n\nsashimi and <mark><mark>Nobu's Moriawase Sashimi Salad</mark></mark>:\nthe fish here is generously cut.  they're fresh and the sauces they come with accent the fish. 5/5\n\n<mark>Shrimp or <mark>Scallop</mark> with Wasabi Pepper or Spicy Garlic</mark> sauce:\nif you like garlic and a little bit of spiciness - this is the dish for you.  the garlic sauce was amazing. the dish comes <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> mushrooms. 5/5\n\n<mark>Tenderloin of Beef</mark> toban yaki:\ncame in a sizzling plate. a piece of very tender and juicy steak with enoki mushrooms <mark>Tuna (Big Eye) and Asparagus</mark>. simple but delightful dish. 5/5\n\nnobu's <mark>House Special</mark>:\nsalmon, tuna, hamachi, avocado and crab meat  wrapped in nori and daikon, sprinkled with masago. each of the 6 pieces are not-so-bite-sized. 4/5\n\n<mark>Salmon Skin</mark> handroll:\n<mark>Salmon Skin</mark> with just a very thin layer of salmon meat making each piece so crispy and delicious. that's all that matters in a <mark>Salmon Skin</mark> handroll. 5/5\n\nkulfi:\nchocolate pistachio frozen custard, nobu cabernet cherries, candied pistachios, chocolate feulletine.  great textures: crispy and creamy. 5/5\n\n<mark>Bento Box</mark>:\nflourless chocolate cake, white chocolate sauce, shiso syrup and green tea <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark>. i'm not sure why it's called a <mark>Bento Box</mark> since it definitely doesn't come in one. it was free and yummy. 4/5"

            "the food here was amazing! we've heard about nobu from a friend of ours and decided to have our valentines dinner here. our waiter suggested 4-5 dishes for the both of us. so, we ordered the monk fish liver <mark>Yellowtail or Salmon <mark>Blue Fin <mark>Toro Tartare</mark> with Royal Ossetra Caviar</mark></mark>, tuna sashimi, salmon tartar, black cod <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark>, uni and an order of the <mark>Soft Shell Crab</mark> roll for the fiance who doesn't enjoy much raw dishes. the food and not to mention the presentation was incredible. we enjoyed each and every dish. for dessert, we picked the <mark>Bento Box</mark> which includes warm valrhona chocolate souffle cake, shiso syrup, white chocolate sauce and green tea <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark> mmmmmmmmmmmmm. i'm so ready to go back and try more dishes on their menu.", 
            "i've read about celebrities going to nobu.  my friend talked about nobu like it was a god of sorts.  when we found out we had a table waiting for us at nobu, i was ready to go and feast myself on its delights.  we ordered: the miso black cod, salmon nigiri, a <mark>Soft Shell Crab</mark> roll, the hamachi <mark>Yellowtail and Jalapeno</mark> appetizer, the <mark>Mushroom Salad</mark>, a vegetarian cut roll, and the tiradito.  to drink i had the cucumber martini.  it was seriously one of the best drinks i have ever had.  it tasted like it was made with lychee vodka, and was smooth, refreshing and not too sweet.  unfor<mark>Tuna (Big Eye)</mark> our positive experience ended there.  after waiting an hour for our table, we had ordered about 15 cucumber martinis and was dying for some water.  we sat at our table and for 9 people, 2 drink menus were placed on the table and then we were ignored.  i glanced at the menus, waited.  our waiter came by and i asked him for waters all around and food menus.  15 minutes go by.  we had no water, and no menus.  finally, we're given 5 menus for 9 people, as he handed me the last menu, he left saying \"we're a little short on menus.\"  we shared our menus and within 3 minutes he was back asking us what we were going to have.  we asked him for some suggestions, and he pretty much just brushed us off.  we finally ordered the hamachi <mark>Yellowtail and Jalapeno</mark>.  before i could order anything else, he rushes off.  the next time we saw him he is dropping of a plate of hamachi <mark>Yellowtail and Jalapeno</mark>.  pretty much the whole night, he just ran off with us halfway through ordering and as a result, we were unable to dine together.  i can only speak for the <mark>Mushroom Salad</mark> and vegetable cut roll.  the vegetable cut roll was pretty good, i mean, steamed <mark>Vegetable</mark>, wrapped in a cucumber wrap, with a little ponzu sauce.  the <mark>Mushroom Salad</mark> was pretty gross.  the mushrooms were varied; trumpets, oysters, shiitake, enoki.  the sauce it was cooked in was sour and as a result made the mushrooms taste bad.  everyone else thought the hamachi <mark>Yellowtail and Jalapeno</mark> were pretty good, and they loved the miso black cod.  everything else, however, they said was mediocre.  mediocreness is ok, if it wasn't coupled with poor service and a $400+ bill.  when the bill came, we inquired about the drinks on the bill as we thought we had taken care of them all at the bar.  his response?  \"no you didn't, but you can just take it out of my tip.\"  i secretly think that everybody raves about this place so much because they don't want to admit they spent that much money on a mediocre experience that you can get anywhere in san francisco for a quarter of the price.  overall verdict:  skip it.  the atmosphere is not really that great, the food isn't really that great, and the service should not be called service.  the pros: the cucumber martini was super good.", 
            "!-!-!a-m-a-z-i-n-g-!-!-!\nok, so first off, i have never been a seafood fan, never mind sushi so this was my second time and it was amazing!!  everything you've heard about nobu is true!  i read the reviews and was down to try it when bf suggested it on our recent vegas trip.\nso we get there and are seated immediately, kudos.  i ordered the champagne 59 or some concoction and bf orders the mango martini-both are very yummay!!  but i think the mango was the better of the two!  \nso, me being a newbie on the sushi scene i was a bit intimidated by the menu and just jumped in and ordered the tuna tempura roll off the cold menu to start off with, really wasn't sure but it proved to be good!!! omg, even bf, who isn't really down <mark>Nobu Crispy Rice with Big Eye Tuna</mark>, was floored.  the tuna had scallions in the middle i believe....whatever it was delish!  and the sauce it had was soooo good, i don't even know what it was, i should've asked.  ok, shit was so good after we ordered the next 2 rolls, we ordered another order of the tuna tempura, and the tempura was so slight, it great crunch to the tiniest degree.\nnext, we ordered the <mark>Soft Shell Crab</mark> roll was again a mystery.  was a very welcome bite to my mouth, i don't know what else was in it but had a crunch also.  the crab was very good, not a hint of the seafoody about it! \nalso on our table was the <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark> roll, i know tempura is a no-no to the sushi elite, but training wheels here kids!  never mind that, this roll was a fave!  i also ordered another plate of this little roll because i loved it so much!  again, tiny bit of the tempura crunch=goodness!  the amazingness of this is too good to put into words......i again don't even know what was in it besides the skrimps but i honestly feel like going there again, like now.  \nso for dessert i ordered this thing described as apple brioche with caramel sauce that comes with a gelato.  it came out and looked like little donut holes!  was so good!  they were covered in sugar and inside was tiny chopped up apples and on the side in a little spoon was the carmel. little bites of <mark>Sweet Shrimp with Fried Head</mark>!  \nas for service-stellar! she was on it when we needed drinks and more sushi, but she kinda lacked when i asked about rolls.  that's ok, i walked out very happy!",

            "we planned to have dinner with our friends who live in vegas on one night of our two night stay there recently. after scouring the restaurant recommendations from my friend, we decided on nobu. sometimes i have to be in the mood for sushi, i don't always crave it like other people i know, so i was worrying about committing to a reservation. i was also worried about having to pay a million dollars (slight exageration; i don't even have a million dollars, and if i did, i would only spend half on wine) for any good wine. (true story, i made the mistake of ordering a glass of wine at the bar in the casino at the flamingo (don't ask) one night and it had me wishing for manischewitz.)\n\nok - back to the matter at hand: nobu has now made me crave sashimi, sushi and all japanese food all the time. not only did the server rattle off, in detail, and totally and completely from her memory, just about every item listed on the menu, but the food was amazing. i die. we had a smattering of everything from each \"category\" and honestly, went a bit overboard, but it was a meal well worth going over board on. \n\nwe dined on:\n\n-edamame\n-<mark><mark>Lobster <mark>Miso Soup</mark></mark></mark>\n-tempura fried rock shrimp <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> type of delicious citrusy, creamy sauce\n-<mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> (out of this world)\n-red <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark> (also, amazing)\n-salmon <mark>White Fish <mark>Scallop <mark>Salmon <mark>Oyster <mark>Beef <mark>Yuba Sashimi New Style</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark> sashimi, which was lightly seared and served with green onion, absolutely delicious\n-<mark>Soft Shell Crab</mark> roll\n-spicy <mark>Big Eye Tuna Roll</mark> (cause, come on, you gotta round out the meal)\n\nthe dessert was good but unremarkable. i'm more about the main event.\n\ncap that <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> amazing gin cocktail that i now forget the name of and two glasses of hellaciously expensive, but delicious, sauvignon blanc, and this is one of the top meals i have had in my little life thus far... \n\nin short, take your gambling winnings to nobu and order everything the server suggests.", 
            "perfection. i love sushi and have been to several nobu restaurants (both new york locations, san diego, bahamas, los angeles) and this place is my favorite. i've been to this nobu over 10 times and look forward to returning. \n\nthe food at any nobu is consistently out of this world but what makes this location my favorite is the staff. not only can each staff member be a model but everyone on staff is attentive, efficient, and interesting. \n\nthings to order:\n- yellowtail jalepeno sashimi\n- butter lettuce cod\n- <mark>White Fish <mark>Scallop <mark>Salmon <mark>Oyster <mark>Beef <mark>Yuba Sashimi New Style</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark> toro sashimi\n- negi toro hand roll \n- kobe sashimi with hot rocks\n- rock <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark>\n- <mark>Soft Shell Crab</mark> special \n- <mark>Artichoke Salad</mark> (without noodles)\n- yk35 sake\n- peach bellini\n- japanese whiskey flight \n- coconut-lime sake\n- <mark>Bento Box</mark>\n\nlast time we were in we had andrew as our server. super great guy. he gave us some excellent recommendations and was very friendly and professional. i'm going to request to sit in andrew's section every time i go back. \n\nof course i wish nobu wasn't so expensive but i still think it's well worth every penny."

            "my first visit to a nobu outpost was about 5 years ago at nobu next door in new york city.  at that point i was still evolving into the foodie that i am today, and for some reason, i absolutely loved the hot spot.  the food was innovative; the atmosphere was exclusive; and snagging a table was a super-heroic feat.  in the years that have passed since, nobu has expanded, and i have also eaten at their nobu 57 in manhattan and the vegas location.  as food culture and my passion for it have evolved, so has my dislike of nobu.  this chain has lost its unique luster, and the quality of the dishes has become a mixed bag.  while some hot and cold courses are better than others, almost anything beats their sushi, which tastes like something ordered from a supermarket's counter.  \n\nmy sushi-fanatic friend and i recently booked a trip to vegas, and her sister had insisted that she try nobu.  i knew that my friend was focused on it, so i went along with the recommendation, though i knew better.  we wound up heading there on our first evening, which at least paved the way for better and better meals as the vacation progressed.\n\nour reservation enabled us to get a table at the crowded spot, and we were immediately seated at a prime location in the center of the dining room.  my friend ordered a glass of sangria, while i opted for a fruity martini, which was so horrifically sweet that i needed to exchange it for a basic glass of sauvignon blanc.  the wine also turned out to be very acidic and not at all similar to the waiter's description.\n\nin terms of the food, we started with two appetizers.  a tiny mound of cool, fresh salmon tartare was immersed in a small bowl of fragrant miso oil and topped with a generous helping of salty caviar.  i am very picky about my tartare, judging it by the amount or lack of flavor it exudes.  this particular version was surprisingly well-seasoned and delicious.  we also sampled one of my favorites - the rock <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark> with spicy sauce.  the succulent fried balls of rock shrimp melted in our mouths, and the spicy mayo sauce <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> a creamy kick. \n\nmy friend stayed firm on our ordering sushi, so we requested the fusion-style <mark>House Special</mark> roll and the <mark>Spicy Scallop</mark> roll.  the <mark>Spicy Scallop</mark> one was pretty flavorful, but their house blend, which included several kinds of fish, had zero taste.  we actually sent it back and did not even bother to order a replacement.\n\nunfor<mark>Tuna (Big Eye)</mark>, i think this restaurant has lost its pizazz, and my friend was not impressed either.  i would really only recommend it for its non-sushi menu items, but even those are inconsistent.", 
            "i'll be honest. i came here for the dessert tasting platter. \n\ni saw the dessert list and died a little at the unique, creative and hitherto unknown creations being offered. so did my boyfriend. we decided we had to make it to nobu even if the apocalypse happened and giant flesh-eating gargoyles descended from the sky.\n\ni did not plan to have a full meal at all but wouldn't you know it, i did. ahhh, i love when upscale japanese restaurants live up to the hype.\n\nyellowtail with jalape\\u00f1o: tender slices of my fish soulmate in an amazing soy yuzu sauce with just a little kick. most perfect dish ever.\n\nbeef tenderloin tabu yaki: not quite as tender as kobe (is anything?) but delicious nonetheless.\n\n<mark>Spicy Scallop</mark> roll: fresh and tasty. the boyfriend was blown away by it, i thought it was good but otherwise unremarkable. i think raw scallop might be his yellowtail, though.\n\nblack cod <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark>: their signature dish. it's really hard to find fault with it. tender, melt-in-your-mouth fish in a sweet, light sauce. it should be heavy, but it's not. that's the miracle of japanese cooking.\n\n<mark>Spicy Seafood Soup</mark>: my favorite kind of food--soupy, spicy, seafoody. oh, and as an <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> bonus, loaded with more varieties of mushroom than a drug farmer. i have seen heaven and it's inside this bowl. get it!\n\nnow on to the nobu dessert platter:\n\n<mark>Bento Box</mark>: flourless chocolate cake with a white chocolate sauce, shiso syrup and green tea <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark>. like a japanese molten cake. did i mention that molten cake is like edible carnal sex? well, it is. so get this. just don't go all matrix reloaded in the restaurant.\n\ntrio of mochi: lessee, we got pumpkin spice, strawberry, <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> flavor not known to man, stuffed with ice-cream and accompanied by sour japanese mountain peaches. mmm...\n\nbananas in phyllo dough with tropical glaze: original creation not on the regular menu (haha!). it's crispy, fried bananas. need i say more?\n\nharom<mark>Aji (Jackfish)</mark> in cinnamon and sugar and center is sweet potato pur\\u00e9e: i totally didn't spell that right and since it's another original creation, i have no menu to look at. already tried googling and found nothing. anyway, this was incredible. i hate sweet potato and i thought this was da bomb. yeah, i'm channeling 2001 lingo.\n\neat here.", 
            "i wish there was a half star rating option and that my friend hadn't talked up nobu up one side and down the other. maybe that is why i wasn't over the moon about it. \n\nfirst off, i will tell you...i had simply the best <mark>Spicy Scallop</mark> roll i've ever had in my sushi lovin life there. you could taste how fresh the scallop was and it was huge pieces. their take on ceviche i was less than taken with. the prices were out of control, but hey it's vegas right? \n\ni wouldn't go out of my way to eat there, but if you are staying at the hrh, definitely have dinner one night.", 
            "whatever god you believe in, thank them for the creation of nobu, because dear lord it is by far and away the best sushi i've ever laid my taste buds on! it may also happen to be the most expensive sushi on the planet, but it if you love sushi, it is worth every penny! \n\ni would be willing to bet that just about anything on the menu is nothing short of amazing, but my favorites included the yellowtail sashimi with jalape\\u00f1o, garnished with cilantro (which they also offer as a roll) and the <mark>Spicy Scallop</mark> roll. now one of the cool things about nobu is that not only do they know how to do sushi, but they have perfected a number of imported kobe/wagyu beef dishes as well. my favorite was the wagyu beef tataki, which is thinly sliced (similar to sashimi), perfectly marbled, lightly seared beef that requires little to no chewing...i'm telling you, it literally melts in your mouth! my drink of choice was a very refreshing pineapple martini, which was the perfect balance to the spice of much of our food selections--if you like a sweet drink, i highly recommend it!\n\nthe atmosphere is what i would call \"high class-zen\" with river rocks, bamboo and ambient lighting abound...and it's even more hip and beautiful at night! vegas has a ton of great restaurants, but if you find yourself with a sushi craving in sin city, do yourself a favor and rush on over to nobu...and if your mouth doesn't water over raw fish, head over anyway...it's sure to be one of your best dining experiences in the city!"

            "i've heard various friends praise los angeles's nobu over the years, so after my girlfriend ran the las vegas marathon this weekend, we decided to celebrate <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> first-class sushi.\n\nwe had reservations at 9:00 pm, and we were seated promptly (actually ahead of time, which was nice). my first impression of the restaurant was that it was extremely loud (we were there on a tuesday night), and its location in the hard rock hotel made me groan (it's a bit out of the way, and not necessarily a place i want to poke around).\n\nour waiter, justin, was initially very prompt with our drink orders, but it took 10 minutes (and a reminder) to get glasses of water, and another 10 to get <mark><mark>Lobster <mark>Miso Soup</mark></mark></mark>.\n\nour first course was only half right (we got two dishes, but one was not what we ordered). the servers apologized and took it away. at the rate they were bringing out our food, though, we shuddered to think how long it would take them to bring out the correct dish. for<mark>Tuna (Big Eye)</mark>, it was corrected quickly.\n\nwhen our sushi came out, we noticed another mistake: the <mark>Spicy Miso Chips <mark>Nobu Crispy Rice with Big Eye Tuna</mark> or <mark>Scallop</mark></mark> had been mistakenly replaced with a second order of <mark>Spicy Tuna (Big Eye)</mark>. again, we told them it was wrong and again, they corrected the mistake rather quickly.\n\nservice got to be so bad that after asking a server to hail our waiter (and subsequently having the request ignored), we decided to get the manager over to our table. we were 30 seconds from getting up and leaving (she took another 5 minutes to get to the table) when she came over and heard our story. she seemed as interested in our plight as any manager should and agreed to comp some of our dishes, which was nice.\n\nstill, however, justin's service through the entire night was abysmal (i think we saw him 3 times over an hour and a half), and no amount of manager treatment could save the tip.\n\nregarding the food, it was ok. the <mark><mark>Lobster <mark>Miso Soup</mark></mark></mark> was great. the <mark>Spicy Tuna (Big Eye)</mark> and scallop rolls were anything but (very mild), and the hot/cold mixture of the tuna tempura rolls was a little strange. it was good, but the temperature difference was one of those things that made me wonder, \"is this supposed to be this way and i'm an idiot for thinking this, or is something actually wrong with how it was made?\" judging by the fact that the tuna tempura rolls were one of the dishes they got wrong initially, it could have been that they rushed the order and made it worse. either way, i wasn't really in love with it.\n\nfor the price i [would have] paid, i can't say that the las vegas nobu is really worth it for me again. i've had much better sushi in oakland, for much less.", 
            "3 words miso marinated cod!\n\nok so we decided to go to las vegas on my friends birthday during his quater life crisis (there is such a thing).  this was the first restaurant we chose to dine at.\n\nfirst off it's at the hard rock hotel.  i don't like this place one bit.  it's over rated and think nobu doesn't fit in this environment of tacky rock n roll memoriabilia minus nirvana.  \n\nok we go in and get drinks first at the bar.  salty dogs are great and they make it damn good at nobu. \n\nwe get seated 20 minutes later even with reservations, this place gets busy.  our server comes and asks us what we would like to order.  we pretty much had the chef's tasting menu and we're glad we did.\n\nfirst course- <mark>Spicy Tuna (Big Eye)</mark> and i think dragon roll- it was good, but come on i can getthose rolls anywhere, give me something interesting!\n\nsecond course- tempura rock shrimp with spicy aioli <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark> <mark>Vegetable</mark> <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> glaze.  very good and for how simple it looked the sauces made it very complex. \n\nthird course- yellowtail with jalepeno and citrus ponzu- amazing!  so damn good i would have eaten just that and be satisfied.  pepper seared rare ahi with chili vinegar sauce- again give me a plate of this and i would die a happy man.\n\nfourth course- miso marinated cod- this is by far the best seafood dish i have ever tried.  the fish was so tender, and the skin was crisp and flavorful!  simply heaven. \n\nfifth course- trio of sorbets\n\ni must say the food was great minus the first course!  <mark>Spicy Tuna (Big Eye)</mark> and dragon roll at a high end japanese restaurant?  i don't know for a tab of $400.00 for 4 people i think that <mark>Spicy Tuna (Big Eye)</mark> is not needed!", 
            "mmmmmmsashimi: i agree with most of the other reviewers about the sound level but luckily we were seated at a table for two next to the bamboo room divider. the level of service from our waiter was impeccable. he was helpful, engaging, and honest about the pros and cons of the menu. we shared a large bottle of nigori sake and edamame - which was seasoned with this light and feathery-textured sea salt. yum. i was disappointed that they did not have spanish mackerel that night but i consoled myself with the <mark>Sashimi Dinner</mark> plate. the salmon was simply mouthwatering and the tuna was perfect as was the yellowtail, <mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark>, ebi, white fish, mackerel, and squid. david ordered the <mark>Spicy Tuna (Big Eye)</mark> <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark> shrimp rolls and an order of unagi. for dessert i had the banana \"toban yaki\" that had sliced bananas and strawberries simmering in calvados.", 
            "so my co-worker & i thought we were invited to a company dinner at ajs steakhouse but were discretely booted from the party since there were too many accounts to entertain.  my co-worker, we'll call her shirley, put her betting face on and said to herself, \"ok, we'll see your ajs and raise you a nobu\" and off we went to plan b.\n\nwe arrived at nobu during a bustling dinner hour but were promptly seated at a table sans reservations, btw, shirley was looking hot as was our server whom we advised to surprise us with the sushi and to keep it coming.  i can't even tell you what we had since a lot of it wasn't on the menu, but most of it revolved around a <mark>Spicy Tuna (Big Eye)</mark> or halibut creation of some sort since we told him that that was what we really liked fish-wise.  and the dishes we got were divinely yummy!  now i don't know if vegas is a good place to judge attention of service when you're dressed for the town in heels that can double as a weapon, but i've always had exceptional service at the 2 nobus i've been to (try the nobu at the intercontinental hotel in hong kong if you get the chance) and the sushi & sashimi has always been creatively presented and fresh.\n\nnow the story ends with shirley and i winning our heady bet by our check averages per person, but it was worth every shot of sake for the trouble we got it in back at the office ; )", 
            "probably the best restaurant in the hrh, but very hot-and-cold.\n\nthe <mark>Creamy Spicy Crab</mark> appetizer and lotus chips were out of this world delicious.  the molten cake desert = divine.  the <mark>Spicy Tuna (Big Eye)</mark> and yellow-tail & jalapeno rolls were meh, definitely had a lot better; the seaweed seemed a bit old and the rice was over cooked.\n\nthe service there was the best i experienced in the hrh (next to the security, surprisingly awesome guys) and the atmosphere was also very nice.  i just love the concept though,  it is basically asian cuisine meets tapas.  \n\nworth it if you are staying at the hrh;  not worth seeking out... except maybe for the cake :)", 
            "went i went to this particular nobu four years ago, it was outstanding. perfection on all front. really some of the best food and service i've ever had. since then, i'm not quite sure if my palate has become more discerning and/or nobu has lost just a little of it's shine. either way, it was still a great meal overall. \n\nhubs and i made a reservation here for my birthday dinner while in vegas. we put a note in the reservation stating so and while it's not a huge deal, we didn't hear happy birthday from our host, server or receive any sort of birthday love. our server was just fine, although he didn't seem to be the happiest of lads. maybe he was having a rough night. regardless, we went on an ordering spree and here's what we snacked on...\n\njalape\\u00f1o hamachi: 5/5: bright, flavorful and incredibly fresh. exactly what i remember about nobu! \n\nehu: 4/5: per the server a new-ish item on the mean, ehu is a short tail <mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark>. i've yet to taste ehu before, but it's a flaky white fish. taste overall was a bit overworked with multiple elements on the plate, but it was tasty. \n\nrock shrimp: 3/5: last time i was at nobu, hubs and i ordered two servings of this. not heart healthy but it used to be creamy and delicious with the shrimp perfectly flash fried. this go around it was clumpier, sticker and not quite as creamy. \n\nblack cod: 3/5: another dish that i used to love. this visit the cod was watery and lacked the complex flavor the miso previously provided. \n\nspicy <mark>Big Eye Tuna Roll</mark>: 4/5: standard <mark>Spicy Tuna (Big Eye)</mark>. fresh, delicious and on the mark. \n\nthis visit was a good one but not a great one overall. i'm still a fan of the ambiance and the creative menu items so here's hoping i came on an off-ish night!", 
            "unbelievable meal. would not recommend getting sushi here the cooked dishes are definitely the way to go. sushi was pretty standard but very expensive.  i was not wowed by the quality of the fish and considering the price i think there are better spots for sushi.  the fried snapper, chili paste and truffle oil edamame, hamachi <mark>King Crab with Amazu Ponzu</mark> sauce,  and <mark>Crab <mark><mark>XO and Jamon Iberico</mark> <mark>Beef <mark>Crab Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark></mark> balls with <mark>Spicy Tuna (Big Eye)</mark>. were some of my favorite dishes.", 
            "too bad i can only eat here like once a year since they charge an arm and a leg but it's an absolute treat! every single thing we ordered was deliciously memorable. the freshest fish ever, albeit in small portions. the oyster trio was yummy! don't skip out on crispy rice cubes and <mark>Spicy Tuna (Big Eye)</mark>. the panna cotta dessert was so light and refreshing, a perfect finish to our meal. the service was top notch as well. again, if dining as a couple, expect to be at least  $200 poorer when you leave this joint, but your tummy will thank you :)", 
            "amazing! \nthe japanese waygu beef was completely....and totally...out of this world.\n<mark>Spicy Tuna (Big Eye)</mark>/scallop rolls are also as enticing.\ni've had many-a-sushi, this places was certainly of the best. \nwonderful service, wonderful atmosphere. it's super bowl weekend and everyone was ready to party...great for large groups. \nupscale restaurant, but in no way stuffy! \nlove!", 
            "this place has gone way down hill and for the price, it is pretty scandalous.  went here last saturday night.  the restaurant wasn't even half full so apparently everyone else already got the memo not to come here anymore.  sidenote:  i'd been here before as well as to two other nobu locations, which is also part of the huge disappointment.\n\nthe sushi portions were tiny.  the rock shrimp was delicious, especially when eaten with the greens (although the server should have told the table to do this since it wasn't obvious to my group so i had to inform them).  the <mark>Spicy Tuna (Big Eye)</mark> on crispy rice was a terrible presentation.  the <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> sashimi was beautiful but boring.  same for the tiny sushi portions we received.  miso cod was still excellent.  but the price considering the portions is just offensive.  all in all, not a great experience and i expect so much more from nobu.  perhaps there's a reason we couldn't get into the caesars location that night.  bottom line:  don't come to this nobu.", 
            "amazing. let me list what i would suggest:\n\n-sake 35 is super smooth\n-sake 40\n-chicken & steak skeweres are amazing\n-sakito peppers instead of edamame \n- <mark>Black Cod Miso</mark>\n-<mark>Spicy Tuna (Big Eye)</mark> hand roll\n\nhowever, if i was to name one thing off the menu to eat and only eat that it would be the black mod soaked in miso for a few days. it is amazing. my boyfriend thought i was crazy for ordering this dish, and ended up eating half. \n\nafter our initial entree orders, we ordered more sashimi toro because the fish literally melted in your mouth it was so delicious.\n\n\n\nask for marcus he is the shit!!!! he took care of us even though he wasn't our waiter. we ended up ordering another fresh-to order plate of shasimi with him."

            "very very good. hard to say that it lived up to the hype, but i thought the omakase was good value for $100. i went with my parents and they also ordered the omakase. the waiter tempted us with the $150 omakase containing \"dishes not on the menu\", but being our first time at nobu, we went with the cheaper omakase. the dishes (as best as i can remember from my pics), in order: (cold-hot-sushi-soup-dessert)\n\n1) toro with spicy miso and caviar - wow, definitely one of the highlights of the omakase. super juicy, melt-in-your-mouth toro topped with a bit of caviar and sitting in a nice spicy miso sauce. omg so good. there was an interesting tiny japanese peach on the side to cleanse the palate.\n\n2) hawaiian <mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> sashimi - very nice texture and mix of flavors with the a citrus sauce, spot of spicy sauce, a sprinkle of black sea salt, and . not sure if it's on the regular menu, maybe it's called something else.\n\n3) kampachi and <mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> sashimi - super exotic and tasty. i didn't even know what kampachi was until i looked it up. apparently it's hawaiian yellowtail farmed in the open ocean off the kona coast of the big island. the trout was also very good. it looks a bit like salmon, but tastes a lot better. served with a nice miso-based sauce (i think) on the side, a couple small veggie sushi rolls, a roasted jalapeno, and a small, yellow, pear-shaped tomato sliced in half.\n\n4) black cod w/ miso - this dish really did live up to the hype. i was about to order it separately in case it did not come with the omakase, but our waiter said it is normally included in the $100 omakase since it's a very popular dish. omg so good. such delicate flavors and texture. amazing. i normally don't like to eat fish skin, but this skin is super good and flavorful. the cod is very light and flaky, but not dry. wow, this is a must try if you come to nobu.\n\n5) beef tenderloin w/ shiitake mushroom <mark>Tuna (Big Eye) and Asparagus</mark> - i didn't think this was that special and probably would not order off the regular menu. it was very good tenderloin though, cooked to a perfect medium rare, with a light sauce. it is served in a sizzling mini cast iron plate.\n\n6) nigiri sushi platter - delicious nigiri, super fresh, and most pieces i normally wouldn't order myself, but were interesting to try. tuna (best i've had in awhile), <mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark>, aji, giant clam, and sweet shrimp. mmm\n\n7) <mark><mark>Lobster <mark>Miso Soup</mark></mark></mark> w/ clams - pretty standard <mark><mark>Lobster <mark>Miso Soup</mark></mark></mark> with a few clams inside. the clams and miso is a good combination, but they can be tricky to fish out and eat with only chopsticks. i cheated on one of them and used two fingers to hold the shell. ;p\n\n8) flourless chocolate cake w/ green tea <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark> - a generous portion served in a cute <mark>Bento Box</mark>. nothing too spectacular or interesting, but delicious nonetheless. the cake was still nice and molten inside when it arrived. yum!\n\na pretty filling flight of dishes for $100. i thought it was good value to try many dishes, but i haven't seen the sizes of the normal dishes. many tables around us also ordered the omakase, as i heard the same descriptions being recited by the staff over and over. i over heard a table of french tourists behind us ordering california rolls, chicken teriyaki, tempura, and other generic stuff you can get anywhere. sigh, what a waste.\n\ni would recommend not to order anything not on the \"hot\" of \"cold\" specialty pages of the menu. the rest is basically traditional japanese fare you can get anywhere, but will probably taste better and cost a lot more at nobu. service was good, polite, and attentive. it was a bit odd when our waiter brought out the first few dishes, and then a couple other different guys brought out some of the following ones. weird.\n\nthe decor is basic, but nothing too special. the sushi bar looks cool and there's a pretty wall of bamboo poles at the back as you walk in. my parents like to eat early, so we moved our reservation to 6pm when they are supposed to open. when we arrived a few minutes early, the door was locked and they didn't seem ready yet. ten minutes later, they were ready. better to come early though, or your omakase may take two hours or longer to get through. ours took about 90 minutes because it wasn't that crowded until after 7.\n\ni think the tenderloin and dessert could have been better and more creative. otherwise, nearly flawless.\n\nif i ever return for a special occasion, i will definitely need to try the $150 omakase. with the economy in shambles, i kinda feel bad eating such an expensive dinner. for<mark>Tuna (Big Eye)</mark>, my parents picked up the tab tonight as i had paid last night at the painted pony. maybe in 2009 they will have a recession special, like gray's papaya. ;p", 
            "my first visit to a nobu outpost was about 5 years ago at nobu next door in new york city.  at that point i was still evolving into the foodie that i am today, and for some reason, i absolutely loved the hot spot.  the food was innovative; the atmosphere was exclusive; and snagging a table was a super-heroic feat.  in the years that have passed since, nobu has expanded, and i have also eaten at their nobu 57 in manhattan and the vegas location.  as food culture and my passion for it have evolved, so has my dislike of nobu.  this chain has lost its unique luster, and the quality of the dishes has become a mixed bag.  while some hot and cold courses are better than others, almost anything beats their sushi, which tastes like something ordered from a supermarket's counter.  \n\nmy sushi-fanatic friend and i recently booked a trip to vegas, and her sister had insisted that she try nobu.  i knew that my friend was focused on it, so i went along with the recommendation, though i knew better.  we wound up heading there on our first evening, which at least paved the way for better and better meals as the vacation progressed.\n\nour reservation enabled us to get a table at the crowded spot, and we were immediately seated at a prime location in the center of the dining room.  my friend ordered a glass of sangria, while i opted for a fruity martini, which was so horrifically sweet that i needed to exchange it for a basic glass of sauvignon blanc.  the wine also turned out to be very acidic and not at all similar to the waiter's description.\n\nin terms of the food, we started with two appetizers.  a tiny mound of cool, fresh salmon tartare was immersed in a small bowl of fragrant miso oil and topped with a generous helping of salty caviar.  i am very picky about my tartare, judging it by the amount or lack of flavor it exudes.  this particular version was surprisingly well-seasoned and delicious.  we also sampled one of my favorites - the rock <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark> with spicy sauce.  the succulent fried balls of rock shrimp melted in our mouths, and the spicy mayo sauce <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> a creamy kick. \n\nmy friend stayed firm on our ordering sushi, so we requested the fusion-style <mark>House Special</mark> roll and the <mark>Spicy Scallop</mark> roll.  the <mark>Spicy Scallop</mark> one was pretty flavorful, but their house blend, which included several kinds of fish, had zero taste.  we actually sent it back and did not even bother to order a replacement.\n\nunfor<mark>Tuna (Big Eye)</mark>, i think this restaurant has lost its pizazz, and my friend was not impressed either.  i would really only recommend it for its non-sushi menu items, but even those are inconsistent.", 
            "before the concert started at the hard rock, i had enough time to sit down and have a fabulous dinner. at first i thought that steak might be a good idea, but i love asian food and wanted a great experience. my boyfriend and i walked into nobu, a japanese restaurant. for our first time there, we decided to ask for assistance with the menu, and chose several things from each part.\n\ntheir menu is broken up by sushi, cold, hot and specialties. we decided to go with a little bit of everything.\n\nour favorite was the <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark>, and the crab tempura with their special sauce. their tempura shrimp and <mark>Vegetable</mark> were great also.\n\noverall, for the price of 266 dollars for two people to eat out of a tasting menu, it was a great experience. i can't say much about their food because i have to say that i've eaten better tempura at our local asian restaurant, well being in the box.\n\nalthough their tempura was okay (it was too soft and not crispy at all), their sushi was as close to the guam experience as we could get. it was sweet, done perfect, and the sauces were impeccable.\n\ni honestly didn't feel that their tempura was worth the 200 dollar ticket. that was majority of our bill. i do believe that their signature <mark>Bento Box</mark> dessert was worth 14 dollars. it was creamy, a perfect souffle, and their green tea <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark> was just like home.\n\nif you want something other than tempura for your experience at nobu, it's worth the price tag and the trip. for myself, a good japanese restaurant serves light, crispy, and fluffy tempura the way i've had it in japan and on guam from top japanese chefs. however, this was not the case, unfor<mark>Tuna (Big Eye)</mark>.\n\ni give this restaurant my personal 3/5 stars.", 
            "i've read about celebrities going to nobu.  my friend talked about nobu like it was a god of sorts.  when we found out we had a table waiting for us at nobu, i was ready to go and feast myself on its delights.  we ordered: the miso black cod, salmon nigiri, a <mark>Soft Shell Crab</mark> roll, the hamachi <mark>Yellowtail and Jalapeno</mark> appetizer, the <mark>Mushroom Salad</mark>, a vegetarian cut roll, and the tiradito.  to drink i had the cucumber martini.  it was seriously one of the best drinks i have ever had.  it tasted like it was made with lychee vodka, and was smooth, refreshing and not too sweet.  unfor<mark>Tuna (Big Eye)</mark> our positive experience ended there.  after waiting an hour for our table, we had ordered about 15 cucumber martinis and was dying for some water.  we sat at our table and for 9 people, 2 drink menus were placed on the table and then we were ignored.  i glanced at the menus, waited.  our waiter came by and i asked him for waters all around and food menus.  15 minutes go by.  we had no water, and no menus.  finally, we're given 5 menus for 9 people, as he handed me the last menu, he left saying \"we're a little short on menus.\"  we shared our menus and within 3 minutes he was back asking us what we were going to have.  we asked him for some suggestions, and he pretty much just brushed us off.  we finally ordered the hamachi <mark>Yellowtail and Jalapeno</mark>.  before i could order anything else, he rushes off.  the next time we saw him he is dropping of a plate of hamachi <mark>Yellowtail and Jalapeno</mark>.  pretty much the whole night, he just ran off with us halfway through ordering and as a result, we were unable to dine together.  i can only speak for the <mark>Mushroom Salad</mark> and vegetable cut roll.  the vegetable cut roll was pretty good, i mean, steamed <mark>Vegetable</mark>, wrapped in a cucumber wrap, with a little ponzu sauce.  the <mark>Mushroom Salad</mark> was pretty gross.  the mushrooms were varied; trumpets, oysters, shiitake, enoki.  the sauce it was cooked in was sour and as a result made the mushrooms taste bad.  everyone else thought the hamachi <mark>Yellowtail and Jalapeno</mark> were pretty good, and they loved the miso black cod.  everything else, however, they said was mediocre.  mediocreness is ok, if it wasn't coupled with poor service and a $400+ bill.  when the bill came, we inquired about the drinks on the bill as we thought we had taken care of them all at the bar.  his response?  \"no you didn't, but you can just take it out of my tip.\"  i secretly think that everybody raves about this place so much because they don't want to admit they spent that much money on a mediocre experience that you can get anywhere in san francisco for a quarter of the price.  overall verdict:  skip it.  the atmosphere is not really that great, the food isn't really that great, and the service should not be called service.  the pros: the cucumber martini was super good.", 
            "probably the best restaurant in the hrh, but very hot-and-cold.\n\nthe <mark>Creamy Spicy Crab</mark> appetizer and lotus chips were out of this world delicious.  the molten cake desert = divine.  the <mark>Spicy Tuna (Big Eye)</mark> and yellow-tail & jalapeno rolls were meh, definitely had a lot better; the seaweed seemed a bit old and the rice was over cooked.\n\nthe service there was the best i experienced in the hrh (next to the security, surprisingly awesome guys) and the atmosphere was also very nice.  i just love the concept though,  it is basically asian cuisine meets tapas.  \n\nworth it if you are staying at the hrh;  not worth seeking out... except maybe for the cake :)", 
            "i absolutely love nobu. i visit vegas 2-3 times per year. every time my husband and i go, we make it a point to dine at nobu. we always get several dishes to share. our favorites are the black cod and the jalapeno sashimi. the sashimi is to die for. i live in the sf bay area where we have a million sushi joints and i have yet to find sashimi as wonderful as nobu's - please if someone knows of a place let me know because i crave yummy sashimi. the spicy miso lotus chips <mark>Nobu Crispy Rice with Big Eye Tuna</mark> is delish too! actually, we have been happy with everything we have tried. \n\nnobu is definitely on the pricey side but so worth every penny. we are always sure to take our time with our meal and savor every bite! our bill is usually anywhere from $80 (no alcohol) to $120 (with alcohol). the other great thing is that all the wait staff work together so your plates are constantly cleared and your table cleaned. they even fold your napkin for you if you get up from the table. \n\nthe only reason why i give nobu 4 stars instead of 5 is because every so often we will get a waiter who is pompous and thinks his shit doesn't stink, which is really unfor<mark>Tuna (Big Eye)</mark> because most of the wait staff is really great! if i could knock only a half star off for that, i would!", 
            "nirvana - pure nirvana. my taste buds were happy, i was very happy. \n\nmy bf too me here (my first trip) for our saturday night dinner. we knew when we walked in that we were having the omakase. i truly cannot pick out one single dish that i liked over the others - every single one was executed perfectly. our waiter was kind enough to write down what we had so we could remember. though he didn't write down the sake pairings we had - every single one of them matched perfectly with the dish. my only sadness with the sake is that i can't buy it anywhere since it is made for nobu (perhaps time to sale it at the restaurant???) \n\ncourse 1: kumomoto oysters, wrapped in <mark>Smoked Salmon</mark> with osetra caviar, served with endive <mark>Tuna (Big Eye) and Asparagus</mark> in sweet and spicy miso sauces (sweet and spicy? oysters? what is not to love?) \n\ncourse 2: <mark>Shima Aji</mark> sashimi served in tosazu gelee with micro celery and sea grapes kelp; garnished with pickled turnip (i'm not normally a turnip fan, but you could serve this to me anytime!) \n\ncourse 3: bluefin tuna sashimi topped <mark>Squid 'Pasta' with Light Garlic</mark> puree and sliced jalapeno, served <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> emulsion over brown rice salsa (okay a truly unique dish - and it was spicy! you know i like spice in my life!) \n\ncourse 4: <mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> trout and seared sweet shrimp <mark><mark>Nobu's Moriawase Sashimi Salad</mark></mark> served with mache, peppercorn, <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Whole <mark>1/2 Maine Lobster</mark></mark> <mark>Roasted Poussin with Spicy Lemon</mark></mark> dressing.

            "went i went to this particular nobu four years ago, it was outstanding. perfection on all front. really some of the best food and service i've ever had. since then, i'm not quite sure if my palate has become more discerning and/or nobu has lost just a little of it's shine. either way, it was still a great meal overall. \n\nhubs and i made a reservation here for my birthday dinner while in vegas. we put a note in the reservation stating so and while it's not a huge deal, we didn't hear happy birthday from our host, server or receive any sort of birthday love. our server was just fine, although he didn't seem to be the happiest of lads. maybe he was having a rough night. regardless, we went on an ordering spree and here's what we snacked on...\n\njalape\\u00f1o hamachi: 5/5: bright, flavorful and incredibly fresh. exactly what i remember about nobu! \n\nehu: 4/5: per the server a new-ish item on the mean, ehu is a short tail <mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark>. i've yet to taste ehu before, but it's a flaky white fish. taste overall was a bit overworked with multiple elements on the plate, but it was tasty. \n\nrock shrimp: 3/5: last time i was at nobu, hubs and i ordered two servings of this. not heart healthy but it used to be creamy and delicious with the shrimp perfectly flash fried. this go around it was clumpier, sticker and not quite as creamy. \n\nblack cod: 3/5: another dish that i used to love. this visit the cod was watery and lacked the complex flavor the miso previously provided. \n\nspicy <mark>Big Eye Tuna Roll</mark>: 4/5: standard <mark>Spicy Tuna (Big Eye)</mark>. fresh, delicious and on the mark. \n\nthis visit was a good one but not a great one overall. i'm still a fan of the ambiance and the creative menu items so here's hoping i came on an off-ish night!", 
            "i was really excited to eat here, especially with all the hype.  unfor<mark>Tuna (Big Eye)</mark>, i was disappointed.  \nthere were 8 of us for a bachelorette party, the service was poor considering the price point for this restaurant.\nwhile the server did warn us the rolls are 'very standard', it seems like if you're a sushi/japanese restaurant of this reputation you should have 'standard' anything.\ngranted the <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> was nice, but again - not drop your jaw amazing.\n\nbesides that, the taxi line at the hard rock is not worth it.",

            "this place has gone way down hill and for the price, it is pretty scandalous.  went here last saturday night.  the restaurant wasn't even half full so apparently everyone else already got the memo not to come here anymore.  sidenote:  i'd been here before as well as to two other nobu locations, which is also part of the huge disappointment.\n\nthe sushi portions were tiny.  the rock shrimp was delicious, especially when eaten with the greens (although the server should have told the table to do this since it wasn't obvious to my group so i had to inform them).  the <mark>Spicy Tuna (Big Eye)</mark> on crispy rice was a terrible presentation.  the <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> sashimi was beautiful but boring.  same for the tiny sushi portions we received.  miso cod was still excellent.  but the price considering the portions is just offensive.  all in all, not a great experience and i expect so much more from nobu.  perhaps there's a reason we couldn't get into the caesars location that night.  bottom line:  don't come to this nobu.",

            "very very good. hard to say that it lived up to the hype, but i thought the omakase was good value for $100. i went with my parents and they also ordered the omakase. the waiter tempted us with the $150 omakase containing \"dishes not on the menu\", but being our first time at nobu, we went with the cheaper omakase. the dishes (as best as i can remember from my pics), in order: (cold-hot-sushi-soup-dessert)\n\n1) toro with spicy miso and caviar - wow, definitely one of the highlights of the omakase. super juicy, melt-in-your-mouth toro topped with a bit of caviar and sitting in a nice spicy miso sauce. omg so good. there was an interesting tiny japanese peach on the side to cleanse the palate.\n\n2) hawaiian <mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> sashimi - very nice texture and mix of flavors with the a citrus sauce, spot of spicy sauce, a sprinkle of black sea salt, and . not sure if it's on the regular menu, maybe it's called something else.\n\n3) kampachi and <mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> sashimi - super exotic and tasty. i didn't even know what kampachi was until i looked it up. apparently it's hawaiian yellowtail farmed in the open ocean off the kona coast of the big island. the trout was also very good. it looks a bit like salmon, but tastes a lot better. served with a nice miso-based sauce (i think) on the side, a couple small veggie sushi rolls, a roasted jalapeno, and a small, yellow, pear-shaped tomato sliced in half.\n\n4) black cod w/ miso - this dish really did live up to the hype. i was about to order it separately in case it did not come with the omakase, but our waiter said it is normally included in the $100 omakase since it's a very popular dish. omg so good. such delicate flavors and texture. amazing. i normally don't like to eat fish skin, but this skin is super good and flavorful. the cod is very light and flaky, but not dry. wow, this is a must try if you come to nobu.\n\n5) beef tenderloin w/ shiitake mushroom <mark>Tuna (Big Eye) and Asparagus</mark> - i didn't think this was that special and probably would not order off the regular menu. it was very good tenderloin though, cooked to a perfect medium rare, with a light sauce. it is served in a sizzling mini cast iron plate.\n\n6) nigiri sushi platter - delicious nigiri, super fresh, and most pieces i normally wouldn't order myself, but were interesting to try. tuna (best i've had in awhile), <mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark>, aji, giant clam, and sweet shrimp. mmm\n\n7) <mark><mark>Lobster <mark>Miso Soup</mark></mark></mark> w/ clams - pretty standard <mark><mark>Lobster <mark>Miso Soup</mark></mark></mark> with a few clams inside. the clams and miso is a good combination, but they can be tricky to fish out and eat with only chopsticks. i cheated on one of them and used two fingers to hold the shell. ;p\n\n8) flourless chocolate cake w/ green tea <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark> - a generous portion served in a cute <mark>Bento Box</mark>. nothing too spectacular or interesting, but delicious nonetheless. the cake was still nice and molten inside when it arrived. yum!\n\na pretty filling flight of dishes for $100. i thought it was good value to try many dishes, but i haven't seen the sizes of the normal dishes. many tables around us also ordered the omakase, as i heard the same descriptions being recited by the staff over and over. i over heard a table of french tourists behind us ordering california rolls, chicken teriyaki, tempura, and other generic stuff you can get anywhere. sigh, what a waste.\n\ni would recommend not to order anything not on the \"hot\" of \"cold\" specialty pages of the menu. the rest is basically traditional japanese fare you can get anywhere, but will probably taste better and cost a lot more at nobu. service was good, polite, and attentive. it was a bit odd when our waiter brought out the first few dishes, and then a couple other different guys brought out some of the following ones. weird.\n\nthe decor is basic, but nothing too special. the sushi bar looks cool and there's a pretty wall of bamboo poles at the back as you walk in. my parents like to eat early, so we moved our reservation to 6pm when they are supposed to open. when we arrived a few minutes early, the door was locked and they didn't seem ready yet. ten minutes later, they were ready. better to come early though, or your omakase may take two hours or longer to get through. ours took about 90 minutes because it wasn't that crowded until after 7.\n\ni think the tenderloin and dessert could have been better and more creative. otherwise, nearly flawless.\n\nif i ever return for a special occasion, i will definitely need to try the $150 omakase. with the economy in shambles, i kinda feel bad eating such an expensive dinner. for<mark>Tuna (Big Eye)</mark>, my parents picked up the tab tonight as i had paid last night at the painted pony. maybe in 2009 they will have a recession special, like gray's papaya. ;p", 
            "nirvana - pure nirvana. my taste buds were happy, i was very happy. \n\nmy bf too me here (my first trip) for our saturday night dinner. we knew when we walked in that we were having the omakase. i truly cannot pick out one single dish that i liked over the others - every single one was executed perfectly. our waiter was kind enough to write down what we had so we could remember. though he didn't write down the sake pairings we had - every single one of them matched perfectly with the dish. my only sadness with the sake is that i can't buy it anywhere since it is made for nobu (perhaps time to sale it at the restaurant???) \n\ncourse 1: kumomoto oysters, wrapped in <mark>Smoked Salmon</mark> with osetra caviar, served with endive <mark>Tuna (Big Eye) and Asparagus</mark> in sweet and spicy miso sauces (sweet and spicy? oysters? what is not to love?) \n\ncourse 2: <mark>Shima Aji</mark> sashimi served in tosazu gelee with micro celery and sea grapes kelp; garnished with pickled turnip (i'm not normally a turnip fan, but you could serve this to me anytime!) \n\ncourse 3: bluefin tuna sashimi topped <mark>Squid 'Pasta' with Light Garlic</mark> puree and sliced jalapeno, served <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> emulsion over brown rice salsa (okay a truly unique dish - and it was spicy! you know i like spice in my life!) \n\ncourse 4: <mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> trout and seared sweet shrimp <mark><mark>Nobu's Moriawase Sashimi Salad</mark></mark> served with mache, peppercorn, <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Whole <mark>1/2 Maine Lobster</mark></mark> <mark>Roasted Poussin with Spicy Lemon</mark></mark> dressing. (this fish was so succulent, buttery and full of flavor - if only i could find this in dc) \n\ncourse 5: pan seared seagrass, seasonal mushrooms, wild ramps, served in <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> sauce \n\ncourse 6: grilled washu beef with eared <mark>Teppan Style Foie Gras</mark>, served over yellow sweet corn and snap peas <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark>-mirin reduction \n\ncourse 7: soup with huge chunks of lobster (yup - huge); loved the little enoki mushrooms in it! \n\ncourse 8: sushi: one standout for me - salt <mark>Fresh Water Eel</mark> with this leaf that kinda tasted like basil <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Whole <mark>1/2 Maine Lobster</mark></mark> <mark>Roasted Poussin with Spicy Lemon</mark></mark> together. wow - yummy (this from the girl who wouldn't eat eel for a long time). not that the other offerings weren't good. \n\ncourse 9: dessert. panna cotta (i think) with strawberry caviar - the caviar was awesome! \n\nfinal: three types of fruit sake. my favorite was the ginger. \n\ni have to say this was one of the highlights of our trip. thoroughly enjoyed the meal and would gladly go again and again.",

            "i was in vegas this past weekend for a bachelorette party. and when we found out there was a nobu here (see my nyc review since i had been to that one quite a few times), we had to come! i was in charge of the ordering since no one else from the party had been there. \r\n\r\nthe decor is similar to new york's nobu, but not as big and not as nice. the service is not as good but it's vegas so oh well.\r\n\r\nwe ordered:\r\n\r\npeach martini and lychee martini - very good but strong.\r\n\r\n<mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> and ponzu sauce - this was fucking good. one of my friend's doesn't eat sashimi and she loved this dish. (see below for kristine n's review). they prepared it with about 20 pieces of sashimi on the plate for our big party! it was great!\r\n\r\n<mark><mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> Salad</mark> - of course i had to order this! i love the salad dressing. \r\n\r\nmiso black cod - the cool thing about nobu is that because we had a group of 8, they actually cut the fish in chunks and put them individually on little lettuce wraps so it would be easier to eat. this was fantastic and sweet.\r\n\r\nchilean sea bass w/ mushrooms - the bride-to-be is a sea bass connoisseur and she said this was not chilean sea bass, but just regular sea bass. it was still very good though. yummm.\r\n\r\nsquid pasta - i love the squid pasta here. complimented w/ asparagus. i love asparagus!\r\n\r\nrock <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark> - we choose the butter sauce since the other sauces had been a bit spicy. yummy.\r\n\r\n<mark>Bento Box</mark> - flourless chocolate cake with <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark>. this was better than i remembered from nyc. it's not flourless as in a chocolate bar on a plate - it actually does have a cake - souffle texture to it. it was great, and gooey in the middle. \r\n\r\nmango caramel ice-cream dessert - a light but tasty dessert with caramel bits in it.\r\n\r\none of the girls and i are not big seafood fans, but we loved all the dishes here. (see below for kristine n.'s review!) that tells ya something! everyone thoroughly enjoyed this meal which made me happy because i hoped they would trust my judgement in food. =)\r\n\r\nit was nice because they brought out each dish one-by-one so you aren't stuffing your faces all at once. by the end of the dinner, we felt extremely satisfied but not so full we were going to explode.\r\n\r\nyay, for nobu!!!", 
            "nobu is a great place to splurge when you have time and want to have good japanese food.  a few quick notes about how to eat there.\n\n1, i've heard the omikase is excellent. it's a safe way to try a nice selection of things.\n2, be nice to your waiter, and it will make all the difference. in general, be nice to the person that brings you your food, and you'll have a better, healthier, more hygenic meal, but here, being nice can mean great service, good advice, and a wonderful experience. i have 1 friend who is a waiter there, and if he can't serve me when i go, i make sure one of the other folks who has helped him wait on me before is my waiter, and i've never had a bad meal, bad location, or bad service.\n3, the black cod <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark>, and hamachi <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> and ponzu are  musts on the menu. i also recommend the squid pasta, rock <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark>, <mark><mark>Nobu's Moriawase Sashimi Salad</mark></mark>, and spicy <mark>Big Eye Tuna Roll</mark>.  the spicy <mark>Big Eye Tuna Roll</mark> there is the best version i've ever had.  the black cod is probably the best treatment of cooked fish i've ever consumed.\n4, enjoy the celebrity spotting. i actually sat next to wayne brady (a very nice guy, and super polite to the staff) at one dinner, and tiffany amber thiessen was there a different night. i can't say the same nice things about her that i mentioned about wayne brady.\n\nall in all, a great meal.  and get the nigori sake...best bang for your buck alcohol wise, and very tasty.", 
            "i was really ready to give nobu an average rating - how much can you really pay for fish?  how good could it really be?  it really is that good.\n\ni was in vegas for a bachelorette party <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> girlfriends, and we went to nobu.  i'd been to nobu next door ages ago in nyc...and i thought it was good but not outstanding.  apparently they save the good stuff for the \"real\" restaurant.\n\ni was underwhelmed by the resaurant decor - it seemed a little bit like any generic japanese restaurant.  but the food was awesome.  we had the tuna <mark><mark>Nobu's Moriawase Sashimi Salad</mark></mark> - tuna was so good and the salad dressing was awesome (i love japanese salad dressing), hamachi <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> peppers, salmon sashimi with chives (loved it - and i'm not even a huge salmon fan), miso cod (liked it...but definitely loved the sashimi more) and the real winner i wasn't expecting was this <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark> dish...  tiny pieces of friend shrimp covered in some sort of mayonnaise-y kind of sauce.  delish.  \nto accommodate some non-fish eaters, we got chicken which was fine, but really, who goes to nobu for chicken?  \n\ni may have to take out a second mortgage on my non-existent house, but it was worth it...", 
            "more like 3 1/2 stars.  i've been to the ny and miami ones, and this is 2nd behind nyc.  good food and service for the most part.  \nfresh <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> - yum, though presentation was better at nyc\nrock <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark> <mark>King Crab with Amazu Ponzu</mark> and chili pepper - yum\n<mark>King Crab Ceviche</mark>- yum\n<mark>Creamy Spicy Crab</mark> - doubt this is authentic but if you love mayo like i do...yum\nwashu beef - served <mark>White Fish <mark>Scallop <mark>Salmon <mark>Oyster <mark>Beef <mark>Yuba Sashimi New Style</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark> - like a carpaccio drizzled with sesame oil - yum\n\nthis is where i would take points away:\n-the space is not that impressive for the prices\n-bathroom being way back out in the casino.  every food establishment should have a convenient place to wash your hands!\n-uni was so--- not fresh,  it was bitter!  though as soon as i mentioned it, the waiter took it off our bill.  i'm just surprised a place of this caliber would serve anything with poor quality.\n-though i expect the specials to be pricey, it would be courteous to mention to a party of two that one of them is $120!", 
            "let me start by saying that i am a sushi freak. so you don't have to wonder, \"hmm... maybe it was just her first time or....\" no. i seriously live for sushi. i eat at incredible places about 3-4 times a month! i dont care about cost either. good sushi is worth it to me! \n\nokay, that being said... i would give nobu a 3.5 stars if that were possible. then again, the only reason i'd bring it up by half would be the friendly servers and great decor. \n\nnow, for the sushi... like someone said below recently, i was expecting to be wowed. i've eaten some amazing food in vegas and hoped this was going to blow those other places out of the water. but this was not to be unfor<mark>Tuna (Big Eye)</mark>. now, i don't know if it's because we're more into nigiri & sashimi and we don't go the hot meal route very often. either way, i was just not impressed. we orde<mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> sashimi which came as big slabs of flavorless fish, no presentation & really no taste either. next was spanish mackerel, usually my fave. this too was bland & boring. then i ordered unagi, which as most sushi fans know takes a while to get to you when they bake it fresh. this was brought to me almost before the words came out of my mouth! fast service yes... but how did he bake it so fast? i discovered the answer when i noticed a plateful of it sitting on top of the little oven already done & waiting. boo!! this caused it to be lukewarm when it arrived. finished off with rock <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark> because at this point we really just wanted out of there realizing that if we saved up what money we'd normally spend, that we could go to one of our fave places soon to make up for it! \n\nrock <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark> was good, i can't lie. but it was also nothing special. oh!! <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> that really bugged me & my dining partner was that the chef wasn't very good at making his rice stick together tight! it fell apart the second you touched it. :( \n\nso to sum up...\n\n1 point for service, 1 point for ambiance and 1 point for food/taste.i do have to say the the fish did taste fresh & the quality seemed safe & good. however,  will i go back? ehh... i would if someone else was buying. but i will never seek it out on my own again i'm sad to say.", 
            "this place was excellent. we went with a bunch of people and ordered a bunch of things on the menu. the <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark> was great and the tuna was also excellent.\n\nthe sushi seemed extremely fresh and the cocktail menu is extensive. i had a lychee martini that was cool and also the tea infused vodka. the waiter said the tea vodka isn't a favorite, but if you like tea i think you'll enjoy it. \n\nthe service was great and we managed to get a reservation on a friday night for 6 people (though we did have to do it during the last time slot).", 
            "i really wanted to try nobu after having an amazing experience at morimoto in philly.  i was not disappointed.  we arrived promptly at our reservation time and were seated immediately.  upon being seated we were greeted by our server within moments.    the atmosphere at nobu is much different than morimoto...nobu is more lively and trendy.  \n\nthey have you order a few dishes from the three parts of their menu.  we started with the oysters and the <mark><mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark></mark> which is served in lettuce wraps.  the lettuce wraps were quite good and the oysters were very earthy tasting. \n\nfor our second course we chose the <mark>Creamy Spicy Crab</mark> and the rock <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark> in butter ponzu.  the <mark>Creamy Spicy Crab</mark> may be one of the best dishes i've ever tasted in a restaurant.  at the end of our weekend i asked my brother in law what his favorite thing was about vegas and he responded without hesitation \"eating <mark>Creamy Spicy Crab</mark> at nobu.\"  not the club, not winning $300, not seeing old friends....the <mark>Creamy Spicy Crab</mark>.  \n\nwe chose 4 sushi rolls for our main course, the house roll which is like a rainbow row except the fish on the inside, a spider roll, unagi avocado (not on the menu but they happily prepared it for us) <mark>Yellowtail and Scallion</mark>.  each of the rolls was well prepared and the fish was fresh.\n\nfor dessert we ordered assorted mochi, which caused brother in law to wet himself for the second time that night.  our assortment included tiramisu, pistachio, honeydew, and raspberry.   all were amazing.\n\nthe service was outstanding throughout the night.  the meal was well paced, it wasn't the lingering three hour affair we had at morimoto but we didn't feel rushed at any point.  in the end i felt that the bill was actually fairly reasonable for what we ordered.  including tip and alcohol it came to about $90 a person.  i do have to <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> it did bother me slightly to find that some of the customers were wearing sneakers, open toe sandals (on men) and collarless shirts.  when i made our reservation they informed me that the dress code did not include these things, which is totally fine.  i'm all for getting dressed up to go out to eat, especially in vegas, and especially at a place like nobu, but i do not like it when i go through the effort and others don't have to.", 
            "if we overlook the fact that the restaurant wrote down our reservation for 10 for the wrong night, my group's dining experience here was exceptional and we were pleased that they were still able to seat us despite this error. the service was incredibly fast (3 people from our group were late and we completely finished our meal by the time they arrived,) and the food was fabulous. the flavors were crisp, unique, and every bite of food was like an explosion in my mouth. since we shared all the dishes we ordered, that pretty much means that we only got one bite so we savored it for all that it was worth. damn you nobu for being so expensive! otherwise i would have ordered 2 of everything!\n\na couple of dishes i would recommend trying are:\n-<mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark>\n-toro tartar <mark>Yellowtail or Salmon <mark>Blue Fin <mark>Toro Tartare</mark> with Royal Ossetra Caviar</mark></mark>\n-black cod <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark>\n-rock <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark>\n-new zealand mussels with the garlic sauce\n\n***the must try dish is the fish/<mark>Lobster <mark>Tuna <mark>King Crab <mark>Vegetable <mark>Salmon Nobu Style Taco</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark>!!!***\nthey are not on the menu here, but you can special order them and they are awesome. i have pictures to prove it.", 
            "amazing!!! were the first words i thought of when i was dining and leaving this restaurant.  my best friend recommended this restaurant as we were planning our vegas trip.  i didn't think much about this place when he brought it up, my expectations were pretty much non-existent.  once we got to the restaurant, it was top notch from start to finish.  we ordered quite a bit of different dishes and it was delicious down to the last bite.  our waiter was quite helpful with our decision making and recommendations.  first dish on our table was the fresh <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark>.  this dish is awesome!  the flavoring along with the fresh yellowtail easily makes this my favorite dish at this restaurant.  we also had the monkfish pate, <mark><mark>Nobu's Moriawase Sashimi Salad</mark></mark>, black cod <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark>, broiled yellowtail collar; <mark>Creamy Spicy Crab</mark>, rock <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark> <mark>King Crab with Amazu Ponzu</mark> and creamy spicy sauce.  all around delicious dishes with great visual presentation.  their lychee martini is also worth a mention, a tasty treat.  i highly recommend this restaurant for those who haven't tried it yet.  this is easily one of my top 10 restaurants.  just a wonderful experience from beginning to finish!",

            "3 words miso marinated cod!\n\nok so we decided to go to las vegas on my friends birthday during his quater life crisis (there is such a thing).  this was the first restaurant we chose to dine at.\n\nfirst off it's at the hard rock hotel.  i don't like this place one bit.  it's over rated and think nobu doesn't fit in this environment of tacky rock n roll memoriabilia minus nirvana.  \n\nok we go in and get drinks first at the bar.  salty dogs are great and they make it damn good at nobu. \n\nwe get seated 20 minutes later even with reservations, this place gets busy.  our server comes and asks us what we would like to order.  we pretty much had the chef's tasting menu and we're glad we did.\n\nfirst course- <mark>Spicy Tuna (Big Eye)</mark> and i think dragon roll- it was good, but come on i can getthose rolls anywhere, give me something interesting!\n\nsecond course- tempura rock shrimp with spicy aioli <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark> <mark>Vegetable</mark> <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> glaze.  very good and for how simple it looked the sauces made it very complex. \n\nthird course- yellowtail with jalepeno and citrus ponzu- amazing!  so damn good i would have eaten just that and be satisfied.  pepper seared rare ahi with chili vinegar sauce- again give me a plate of this and i would die a happy man.\n\nfourth course- miso marinated cod- this is by far the best seafood dish i have ever tried.  the fish was so tender, and the skin was crisp and flavorful!  simply heaven. \n\nfifth course- trio of sorbets\n\ni must say the food was great minus the first course!  <mark>Spicy Tuna (Big Eye)</mark> and dragon roll at a high end japanese restaurant?  i don't know for a tab of $400.00 for 4 people i think that <mark>Spicy Tuna (Big Eye)</mark> is not needed!", 
            "mmmmmmsashimi: i agree with most of the other reviewers about the sound level but luckily we were seated at a table for two next to the bamboo room divider. the level of service from our waiter was impeccable. he was helpful, engaging, and honest about the pros and cons of the menu. we shared a large bottle of nigori sake and edamame - which was seasoned with this light and feathery-textured sea salt. yum. i was disappointed that they did not have spanish mackerel that night but i consoled myself with the <mark>Sashimi Dinner</mark> plate. the salmon was simply mouthwatering and the tuna was perfect as was the yellowtail, <mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark>, ebi, white fish, mackerel, and squid. david ordered the <mark>Spicy Tuna (Big Eye)</mark> <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark> shrimp rolls and an order of unagi. for dessert i had the banana \"toban yaki\" that had sliced bananas and strawberries simmering in calvados.",

            "nobu.\n\nwell, what can i say?  i've wanted to go to nobu for a really, really long time.  being in vegas for the weekend, i decided this would be the time to do it. \n\nwe started with an assortment of sashimi.  tuna, mackerel (which was completely delicious) and a couple others .... my brain stopped operating clearly after the mackerel.  then a large platter of raw chilean sea bass with enoki and baby bok choy.  a warm ginger infused mushroom broth was ladled over the fish table side which cooked the melt-in-your mouth, luscious bass ever so gently.  mmmmmmm.\nnext came tempura king crab legs with an accompanying  broth (which had sensational body) poured over the tempura right before eating.  it was amazing.  my husbands eyes rolled back into his head- i thought that he was having a seizure.  then came the spicy <mark>Big Eye Tuna Roll</mark> <mark>Eel and Cucumber</mark> roll.  both good.  but the item that stole the show had to be the uni.  and i mean in a bad way.  so i've never had uni.  i know that is super lame.  but i've been waiting until i was at a really good establishment because i wanted to be sure that i was getting the best uni prepared by competent hands.   my fantasy of being super cool vanished in a swift goopy instant.     eeeeeewwww.\nso it came pureed and then wrapped <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark> 'd.  wow.  well, having always prized myself on being somewhat of an adventurous eater i dove in head first, offering myself as the guinea pig.  big mistake!  i take a bite.  the exterior is nice and crisp.  within an instant my mouth was flooded with velvety toxic sea puke, orange ooze dripping on my plate below.  maintaining composure was very difficult- however, this practice will come in handy once the check comes.\n-abalone wasn't much more pleasant- similar flavor with the texture of chewing on somebody's ear.\nthank god a clever distraction appeared soon thereafter the \"uni incident\".  super thin slices of beautifully marbled raw kobe beef on a large platter with six super hot rocks and an assortment of condiments and seasoning.  so we got to cook our own slices of kobe using our chopsticks as our instruments on the hot rocks.  can we say fun?  i've always wanted to do that.\ndessert sounded cool on the menu but in actuality it didn't taste too hot.  i did like the shiso sorbet though.\n\nthe reason why i have given nobu 4 stars instead of 5 is because the fact that i had to go to the skanky, garish, soulless, death trap that is vegas in order to dine there and because of the price.  even as i am writing this i cannot believe what i am about to say.  i am accustomed to spending 250$ or so on a nice dinner .  in this instance i was prepared to pay around 500-550$.  but for a party of four, with no alcohol bill to speak of and 2 people confessing that they were still hungry upon our exiting, the bill came to 700 big ones.  ouch!  gees- i have to confess feeling mildly nauseas directly afterward.  am i just a cheap ol' broad?  or have i gone and acquired some sort of conscience or something?  something just felt really wrong about that.    i just feel like it was self indulgent and empty.  but, then again, i guess that pretty much sums up vegas.", 
            "the <mark>Lobster <mark>Tuna <mark>King Crab <mark>Vegetable <mark>Salmon Nobu Style Taco</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark> were probably the most whimsical, brilliant, west coast culinary delight that i've ever tasted.  sounds simple, but i dare any high end mexican eatery to execute as well as the chefs at nobu.\n\nthe <mark>Yellowtail or Salmon <mark>Blue Fin <mark>Toro Tartare</mark> with Royal Ossetra Caviar</mark></mark> was different than anything i've ever put in my mouth.  top 5 meals of my life.", 
            "i agree with ming-jou in the fact that i was totally disappointed at this place. i should have also listened to my friend who went there and was really disappointed at their omakase, but being japanese, i wanted to try their food to see what the hype was about.  we had reservations at 9 pm and although we got there earlier, they didn't seat us till then.  it was shockingly a loud place that we often had to yell at each other to talk and even to order.  also, the crowd was much older than i anticipated.  the interior had a nice asian feel to it with bamboos everywhere, even on the ceilings.\n\nfor starters, we had edamame, yellowtail tartar <mark>Yellowtail or Salmon <mark>Blue Fin <mark>Toro Tartare</mark> with Royal Ossetra Caviar</mark></mark>, <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark>.  the menu was vague that we didn't expect any sauce with the tartar, but to our surprise, it came in a sauce with wasabi that was a little spicy.  i wish the menu would have included more details.  we got to order individual tempura items, which was a \"first\" for me.  we ordered shrimp, broccoli, and sweet potato.  the order came with 2 pieces each.  i liked how it came out really hot with light batter.  also, they were generous with their tempura sauce with daikon-oroshi (grated daikon).  most places give you barely enough sauce.  for dinner, we shared the <mark>Sushi Dinner</mark> which came with 8 nigiri and 6 pieces of tekka maki (<mark>Big Eye Tuna Roll</mark>).  the sushi rice tasted old as it was cold and flat, not warm and plump.  also, the rice portion for a nigiri was much more than it needed.  fish seemed fresh, but the rice was disappointing.  that ruined my dinner.\n\nwe decided to try their dessert since we don't usually order dessert at an asian restaurant.  we tried their miso almond cake which was the best part of my meal.  it came <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> caramel glaze and edamame <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark>.  the cake was yummier than i expected.  \n\noverall, it was not as good as i expected but i'm giving 3 stars for the good dessert and the great service.", 
            "i'm not going to lie--a small part of me dies every time i think about how much we spent here.  but the truth of the matter is, you can't get good sushi without paying for it.  \n\nwe ordered the $100 omakase, the uni tempura set, kabocha tempura, and salmon sashimi.\n\nthe fusion dishes (like the hamachi <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> or the snapper with cucumber <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Whole <mark>1/2 Maine Lobster</mark></mark> <mark>Roasted Poussin with Spicy Lemon</mark></mark> juice) were fun to try but i find that the sauces often overpower the fish, which is the best thing about nobu.  if you have never tried any of their signature dishes, you might want to order at least one of the omakase options, but if you're just looking to enjoy the fish qua fish, then order the sashimi and/or nigiri a la carte.\n\nand yes, let's talk about the fish.  i have never had such a wonderfully buttery miso black cod!  and the toro, maguro, aji, trout, and sake (as in salmon sashimi) simply melted in our mouths.  no biting necessary.  the only low point was that the anago in our complimentary sushi was littered with small fish bones but hey, it was complimentary!  yet another reason why i love nobu.  they know how to treat the ladies right.\n\nas for the tempura, the kabocha was out of season, so it was our bad for ordering it in the first place, but the uni tempura was unlike anything i have ever had.  every bite was bursting with succulence and the tempura batter <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> extra texture and flavor.  heavenly.  anyone who is a fan of uni and/or tempura needs to try this!  it also comes with tempura shiitake mushroom (luxuriously juicy), tempura shiso leaf (so crispy, so light), and one other <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark> that i forget but that my mom thought was delicious.\n\nthe dessert was lovely too--we had the <mark>Bento Box</mark> which consists of flourless chocolate cake and homemade green tea <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark>.  not too sweet and the perfect way to end a perfect meal.\n\ni seriously cannot wait to come back here again and try the <mark>Hamachi Kama</mark>, the snapper, the whole fried fish, and the squid salad.  is it expensive?  yes.  but is it worth it?  most definitely.", 
            "this is my second time here and both times i've come with my cousin. as much i love nobu, i only go there with her, since she loves it so much, but i never regret it. \n\nthe nice thing is i just let her order, since she knows what's good, but then if i ever go alone, i won't really know what to order. i did have a nice acai cocktail to start the night. it was delicious and refreshing, great way to start the meal. \n\nwe ordered the <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> which i loved since i love the spice. then we had the seafood spring rolls which weren't on the menu, but since they go there all the time, they knew about it. those were also really good, along with the <mark><mark>Nobu's Moriawase Sashimi Salad</mark></mark>. loved the dressing and there was so much sashimi! we also had the rock <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark>, which was kinda like popcorn shrimp, but really tasty <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> grilled beef thing. \n\nat the end, we ordered the <mark>Bento Box</mark>, which was a flourless chocolate cake with green tea <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark>. everything was really good, but service was a little slow. my other friends were also there and they were a party of 10. they started a little after us but finished before us!! other than that though, it was a great night.", 
            "went here on a saturday night. we got there at 10:30pm and it was still packed. we ordered the yellowtail sashimi w/ jalapeno, very good. followed by the <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark> roll and <mark><mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark></mark>, both were good. i wouldn't say anything spectacular but good nevertheless. the best for last, the <mark>Black Cod Miso</mark> lettuce wrap was very good. it's sweet, buttery, hot & cold, soft & crunchy. the dish was the highlight of the evening. the gf enjoyed the miso immensely. we also had the <mark>Bento Box</mark> dessert, simple but good. service was good to us.\n\nbeing nobu, you pay a pretty penny for a small amount of food. ok...you'll drop a few bills here. but it's worth going to, esp. if you never been.", 
            "have the bluefin <mark>Toro Tartare</mark> w/ caviar & the miso black cod - we made the mistake of ordering the lettuce wrap instead of the whole fish this weekend, order the fish instead of the wraps its muuuuch better. you cannot go wrong with anything on the menu! i don't remember what else we had because we had one of each of the specials. *be sure to have uni w/ quail egg and the cucumber or acai martini \n\nthe service:\n\nthe first time we went it was impeccable.\n\nsecond time, it was no bueno... i brought friends here bc i had been ranting and raving about it & they wanted to hear what the fuss was about. the food they loved (minus the <mark>Lobster <mark>Tuna <mark>King Crab <mark>Vegetable <mark>Salmon Nobu Style Taco</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark>). so about the service, i think the waiter was having some issues. i had him repeat the order beforehand bc i wanted everything to go smoothly. regardless of that he messed up our order. drinks - brought one too many, double ordered the miso black cod & the brought the wrong kobe dish which is $35 an oz..... we got a few ounces. it reflects me so i was bothered, i tried to work it out with the waiter bc i for one was not going to have us pay for his mistakes. he was only able to comp 2 oz of the kobe and remove half of the cod.. usually service can ruin a rating but i love the food and forgive the guy, must've been one of those days.",

            "my first visit to a nobu outpost was about 5 years ago at nobu next door in new york city.  at that point i was still evolving into the foodie that i am today, and for some reason, i absolutely loved the hot spot.  the food was innovative; the atmosphere was exclusive; and snagging a table was a super-heroic feat.  in the years that have passed since, nobu has expanded, and i have also eaten at their nobu 57 in manhattan and the vegas location.  as food culture and my passion for it have evolved, so has my dislike of nobu.  this chain has lost its unique luster, and the quality of the dishes has become a mixed bag.  while some hot and cold courses are better than others, almost anything beats their sushi, which tastes like something ordered from a supermarket's counter.  \n\nmy sushi-fanatic friend and i recently booked a trip to vegas, and her sister had insisted that she try nobu.  i knew that my friend was focused on it, so i went along with the recommendation, though i knew better.  we wound up heading there on our first evening, which at least paved the way for better and better meals as the vacation progressed.\n\nour reservation enabled us to get a table at the crowded spot, and we were immediately seated at a prime location in the center of the dining room.  my friend ordered a glass of sangria, while i opted for a fruity martini, which was so horrifically sweet that i needed to exchange it for a basic glass of sauvignon blanc.  the wine also turned out to be very acidic and not at all similar to the waiter's description.\n\nin terms of the food, we started with two appetizers.  a tiny mound of cool, fresh salmon tartare was immersed in a small bowl of fragrant miso oil and topped with a generous helping of salty caviar.  i am very picky about my tartare, judging it by the amount or lack of flavor it exudes.  this particular version was surprisingly well-seasoned and delicious.  we also sampled one of my favorites - the rock <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark> with spicy sauce.  the succulent fried balls of rock shrimp melted in our mouths, and the spicy mayo sauce <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> a creamy kick. \n\nmy friend stayed firm on our ordering sushi, so we requested the fusion-style <mark>House Special</mark> roll and the <mark>Spicy Scallop</mark> roll.  the <mark>Spicy Scallop</mark> one was pretty flavorful, but their house blend, which included several kinds of fish, had zero taste.  we actually sent it back and did not even bother to order a replacement.\n\nunfor<mark>Tuna (Big Eye)</mark>, i think this restaurant has lost its pizazz, and my friend was not impressed either.  i would really only recommend it for its non-sushi menu items, but even those are inconsistent.",

            "i've been dying to try out nobu and matsuhisa in la for the longest time, but the thought of making a drive that far just for sushi just couldn't be justified...until now. nobu is actually a japanese fusion restaurant, so for all of you purest out there, this is not your dining of choice.\n\nnow for the food...the ingredients are what make japanese food such a delicacy. and when it comes to seafood, especially sashimi, if your stock isn't fresh, i can taste it. that said, we decided to stuff our faces for the true nobu experience. \n\n*the yk50 is a semi-dry and rather sweet sake that was super light\n*<mark>Shishito Peppers</mark> - grilled peppers w/ an extremely simple miso sauce w/ toasted sesame\n*tuna tataki. great sauce, perfect w/ the daikon and garlic chips.\n*kumamoto oysters. not the best i've had, the sauces actually took away from the natural sweetness of this variety of oyster.\n*yellowtail sashimi w/ jalapenos. probably my favorite of the meal. extremely simple sauce w/ a spicy bite. my mouth is salivating just thinking about it :p\n*<mark><mark>Nobu's Moriawase Sashimi Salad</mark></mark>. we got a tuna/hamachi mix instead. it had a delicious miso dressing on a medley spring mix\n*amai ebi. it was a little oily this time, but the shrimp was ridiculously fresh.\n*crunchy roll w/ king crab. probably my least favorite of the night. it was creative though with the crunch topping that gave a nice twist on the typical roll.\n*tempura plate. the <mark>Vegetable</mark> were so sweet, it didn't even require the tentsuyu (tempura sauce)\n*fried shrimp w/ butter ponzu sauce. butter and ponzu is an amazing combination. so its not typical japanese but definitely try this one if you get a chance. \n\ni do believe i've never truly experienced a food coma until tonight.", 
            "before the concert started at the hard rock, i had enough time to sit down and have a fabulous dinner. at first i thought that steak might be a good idea, but i love asian food and wanted a great experience. my boyfriend and i walked into nobu, a japanese restaurant. for our first time there, we decided to ask for assistance with the menu, and chose several things from each part.\n\ntheir menu is broken up by sushi, cold, hot and specialties. we decided to go with a little bit of everything.\n\nour favorite was the <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark>, and the crab tempura with their special sauce. their tempura shrimp and <mark>Vegetable</mark> were great also.\n\noverall, for the price of 266 dollars for two people to eat out of a tasting menu, it was a great experience. i can't say much about their food because i have to say that i've eaten better tempura at our local asian restaurant, well being in the box.\n\nalthough their tempura was okay (it was too soft and not crispy at all), their sushi was as close to the guam experience as we could get. it was sweet, done perfect, and the sauces were impeccable.\n\ni honestly didn't feel that their tempura was worth the 200 dollar ticket. that was majority of our bill. i do believe that their signature <mark>Bento Box</mark> dessert was worth 14 dollars. it was creamy, a perfect souffle, and their green tea <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark> was just like home.\n\nif you want something other than tempura for your experience at nobu, it's worth the price tag and the trip. for myself, a good japanese restaurant serves light, crispy, and fluffy tempura the way i've had it in japan and on guam from top japanese chefs. however, this was not the case, unfor<mark>Tuna (Big Eye)</mark>.\n\ni give this restaurant my personal 3/5 stars.",

            "i've read about celebrities going to nobu.  my friend talked about nobu like it was a god of sorts.  when we found out we had a table waiting for us at nobu, i was ready to go and feast myself on its delights.  we ordered: the miso black cod, salmon nigiri, a <mark>Soft Shell Crab</mark> roll, the hamachi <mark>Yellowtail and Jalapeno</mark> appetizer, the <mark>Mushroom Salad</mark>, a vegetarian cut roll, and the tiradito.  to drink i had the cucumber martini.  it was seriously one of the best drinks i have ever had.  it tasted like it was made with lychee vodka, and was smooth, refreshing and not too sweet.  unfor<mark>Tuna (Big Eye)</mark> our positive experience ended there.  after waiting an hour for our table, we had ordered about 15 cucumber martinis and was dying for some water.  we sat at our table and for 9 people, 2 drink menus were placed on the table and then we were ignored.  i glanced at the menus, waited.  our waiter came by and i asked him for waters all around and food menus.  15 minutes go by.  we had no water, and no menus.  finally, we're given 5 menus for 9 people, as he handed me the last menu, he left saying \"we're a little short on menus.\"  we shared our menus and within 3 minutes he was back asking us what we were going to have.  we asked him for some suggestions, and he pretty much just brushed us off.  we finally ordered the hamachi <mark>Yellowtail and Jalapeno</mark>.  before i could order anything else, he rushes off.  the next time we saw him he is dropping of a plate of hamachi <mark>Yellowtail and Jalapeno</mark>.  pretty much the whole night, he just ran off with us halfway through ordering and as a result, we were unable to dine together.  i can only speak for the <mark>Mushroom Salad</mark> and vegetable cut roll.  the vegetable cut roll was pretty good, i mean, steamed <mark>Vegetable</mark>, wrapped in a cucumber wrap, with a little ponzu sauce.  the <mark>Mushroom Salad</mark> was pretty gross.  the mushrooms were varied; trumpets, oysters, shiitake, enoki.  the sauce it was cooked in was sour and as a result made the mushrooms taste bad.  everyone else thought the hamachi <mark>Yellowtail and Jalapeno</mark> were pretty good, and they loved the miso black cod.  everything else, however, they said was mediocre.  mediocreness is ok, if it wasn't coupled with poor service and a $400+ bill.  when the bill came, we inquired about the drinks on the bill as we thought we had taken care of them all at the bar.  his response?  \"no you didn't, but you can just take it out of my tip.\"  i secretly think that everybody raves about this place so much because they don't want to admit they spent that much money on a mediocre experience that you can get anywhere in san francisco for a quarter of the price.  overall verdict:  skip it.  the atmosphere is not really that great, the food isn't really that great, and the service should not be called service.  the pros: the cucumber martini was super good.", 
            "skip nobu if you've been to any other location. the atmosphere was very la and kind of snobby. it's a place to see and be seen and sadly this is applicable to the food as well. the menu was confusing and it almost felt like this was done on purpose in order to force the diner to chose the chef's tasting menu. we decided against it (at $100+ per person, we felt we could do better). we chose the <mark><mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark></mark>, <mark>Nobu Crispy Rice with Big Eye Tuna</mark> tempura roll and the <mark>Lobster <mark>Tuna <mark>King Crab <mark>Vegetable <mark>Salmon Nobu Style Taco</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark> to start. the tacos were insanely delicious and everything hit the mark quite well. these composed the \"cold\" dishes that nobu offers and then we moved on to the hot dishes which included kobe beef tataki style, black cod <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark> as well as some sashimi. the kobe beef was incredible and literally melted in our moths and it's no wonder the cod is a famous dish - it was delicious. looking at the menu now i'm uncertain as to why we felt the way we did, but i remember being less than enthused about dropping a few hundred dollars and not feeling like i got real value from our money. the atmosphere was cold and had it been a little friendlier perhaps we would have felt differently. the food felt like a celebrity chef was overseeing it, but you could tell this restaurant was a chain given how gimmicky everything was. sad because there's such a brand behind this name and they're just not living up to it.",

            "in a word perfect.  in a few words, unbelievably amazing.  you cannot put more care, soul, and most importantly flavor into the detail of every slice, every sauce, and every delicately placed item on each plate. private label sake is of the best i've had. service was spot on.\n\nmust haves:\n<mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark>\n<mark>Black Cod Miso</mark> lettuce cups\nrock <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark> with creamy spicy sauce\nbroiled yellowtail collar", 
            "this is the 2nd time i've been to nobu las vegas, the first time was probably 8 years ago and i remember loving the food!  this time, i was underwhelmed and here are the reasons why:\n\n1. <mark>White Fish <mark>Scallop <mark>Salmon <mark>Oyster <mark>Beef <mark>Yuba Sashimi New Style</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark> sashimi isn't really new anymore, it's been around for a dang long time and to be honest, it's kinda played out.  s.b. and i both agreed that the plain sashimi was way better.  one suggestion would be to keep the sauces on the side rather than drowning the delicate fish...\n2. confusing menu - they had filet mignon in about 4 places on the menu, all with cryptic descriptions and different prices - once on the specials, twice on the hot items, and again on the last page.  i asked the waiter what was the difference between them all, and he wasn't able to articulate it.  we settled on the one with uni butter and peruvian potato salad ($50), it was char grilled and tender, but the cabernet sauce was way too sweet.\n3. the format made me think of a deconstructed combo plate, where you pick and choose off of the different menus, but in the end you basically had a combo plate - complete <mark>Chilean Sea Bass with Black Bean, Dry Miso, or Balsalmic Teriyaki</mark> chicken, salad, <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark>!\n\ndon't get me wrong, the food was still very good, but the experience just didn't have the same wow factor.  i guess back in the day, this was kinda revolutionary for a japanese restaurant.  it was high end, high quality, modern ambiance, and modern preparation, but 10 years later, after everyone and their mother has copied this format, it's just common.\n\nback to the drawing board nobu!", 
            "so obviously if you are going here you know what to expect. we had a great experience. our server was one of the ones who went to open dubai, so we were well taken care of. he did warn us because of our reservation time (10:15p) and kitchen closing (11p), that he was unsure how they would send out what we ordered. so we were prepared. of course, if you are spending nobu money my feeling is the chefs serve until you are done. but that is the only reason for the 4th star, well and another completely over priced wine list. \n\ni have been to nobu next door in nyc, so this was a different experience.\n\nonto the food; we jumped all over the menu but stayed away from the sashimi because that seemed over priced f<mark>Premium Sushi or Sashimi</mark>. we ended up with a few hand rolls that were great because the nori was crispy (which seems tough for other places to pull off). \n\nfrom there we also had the <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark>, as always. then we had the <mark><mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark></mark>, and a couple <mark>Lobster <mark>Tuna <mark>King Crab <mark>Vegetable <mark>Salmon Nobu Style Taco</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark> as well. both good and the <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> great.\n\nmake sure you get the black cod <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark> in lettuce. awesome! just eat it straight away because it comes warm.\n\nif you haven't been, go!",

            "i had wanted to try nobu for some time, having heard many good things about it. when i saw the $99 groupon plus the 20% off groupon was offering plus my wife's b'day to celebrate there, i knew the stars were aligned.  could it live up to reputation?\nthe food: the groupon is for a 5 course tasting menu. the meal starts with a pass out of edamame with maldon salt. a very generous portion and an excellent way to start a meal. the first course was yellowtail tuna <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> and cilantro. the tuna was sliced super thin and was in a citrus sauce. it was very tasty and different than yellowtail that i have eaten at my local sushi restaurant. things got even better after that. the next dish was rock <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark> with a creamy spicy sauce. wow, was that good! not like any tempura i have eaten before. very lightly breaded, cooked so the shrimp were soft but not mushy. and the spicy sauce was easily handled even by my gringo palate. a great dish. and a huge portion. by its size, the dish would have been enough for dinner if it was the only thing served. this was followed by the alaskan black cod <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark>. another outstanding dish. the fourth course was the sushi; tuna, fluke and salmon with a california roll. this was the weakest part of the menu - only very good. last course, dessert. i photographed the plate. a beautiful presentation with very tasty treats (and a hand written birthday greeting in chocolate). the food rates 5 stars plus.\nthe service: as soon as we were seated, our server, albert, came by to greet us, explain the tasting menu, and take our drink orders. throughout the meal, he, the busboy, and the food runner were very attentive without being overbearing. they made us feel very welcome. our water glasses were never allowed to go below half full. the table was cleared promptly. the food came out of the kitchen plated beautifully. the service was 5 stars plus.\nthe ambiance: the restaurant is nicely decorated with lots of bamboo. however, the tables for 2 were placed one on top of the other. we were there on a monday night, so the tables were never more than 1/3 full.  but our table was about 6 inches from the next table, which was 6 inches from the next in a line up of 4 tables. if the restaurant were crowded and there were people at the next table, we would have been eating with strangers. not my idea of a celebration/romantic meal. at best, 3 stars for ambiance.\nvalue: $80 for dinner of this quality is the deal of the decade. i would do it again in a heartbeat. but i would never go on a weekend night when the table next to me might be occupied (or i would go with a party of 6 or more - the bigger tables were nicely spaced out).", 
            "there's a groupon for nobu?!! whaaaat!?! yes, believe it! i had purchased a groupon for a 5 course tasting menu for $80 for 2 people. and my bf was super excited because he has been wanting to try this place for a while now. it was actually perfect timing that this groupon became available because i was going to be in vegas this weekend. *woot woot!* anyways, i made reservations for 2 at 6pm online and got an e-mail confirmation right away. the groupon can only be used at the nobu inside the hard rock hotel. there's also a nobu inside caeser's palace. once we checked in with the hostesses, we were immediately seated at a nice comfy table and were greeted with a big welcome in japanese! the decor inside was really nice and elegant. i really liked the bamboo wall they had. i also thought it was really cute that we each had a rock on our table used as a chopstick holder. \n\nok onto the food! so we started off <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> edamame with sea salt, which was nothing too special but was good. next came the best sashimi i had ever had in my life! its yellowtail sashimi with a jalapeno slice on top dressed in almost like a ponzu sauce. the flavors went really well together and the yellowtail was fresh and spicy. yumm!!! i can probably eat like five more of that dish. :p the next dish was also another one of their popular dishes: the <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark>. i was really surprised that the shrimp didn't look at all like the usual tempura found at japanese restaurants. the dish almost looked like honey walnut shrimp actually but tasted ten times better. it was rich and creamy. and the sauce it was covered in was deliscious. next came their black cod dish. my bf absolutely loved this one and i can see why. it was so flakey and cooked to perfection. the fish melted in our mouths like butter and it was sweet and savory. next came a plate of sushi, which consisted of a califonia roll and 6 pieces of sashimi sushi. this dish was nothing too fancy and didn't stand out too much. but it was still tasty. and lastly we got our dessert! it was such a cute looking dessert, which composed of a green tea ice-cream, a flourless chocolate cake, and a cuppacino cup. omg...so good!!! the green tea ice-cream is made in house and  after one bite and you definetely know it's green tea ice-cream. the cuppacino cup was probably my favorite out of the other 2 <mark>Dessert</mark> because it was so beautifully crafted and tasted heavenly. the chocolate cake was very fluffy and not too sweet. overall, everything we tried was excellent! the reason why i subtracted 1 star was because both my bf and i felt that the cod and the shrimp was slightly on the saltier side and all of the dishes are pretty small plates to share between 2 people. otherwise, customer service here was superb and our server was just so friendly and informative on the dishes we were trying. i'm so happy to get to try nobu for the first time! =) so go get your groupon, while it's still available peeps!!", 
            "absolutely terrific!  food is always consistent and service is terrific. if there is one knock, it's the atmosphere. tables are a bit squished together and narrow for 2. signature dishes jalape\\u00f1o yellowtail, miso salmon <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark> shrimp are musts!", 
            "impeccable comes to mind when i look back at dinner last night. just wow! \nwe started with <mark>Shishito Peppers</mark> and an amazing tuna <mark><mark>Nobu's Moriawase Sashimi Salad</mark></mark>, moved on to a squid and vegetable dish/casserole that was out of this world followed by miso blackened cod that was absolutely mouth watering.  then came some of the best sushi! yellowtail with scallion roll, yellowtail with jalape\\u00f1o roll, <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark> roll. the wine was a lovely napa chardonnay. \nthe ambiance of this restaurant is calming and the service is excellent! \njapanese restaurants are plentiful in this town so an outstanding stand out restaurant in this category means a lot: this restaurant is outstanding and stands on its own!\nthe prices are very reasonable. not at all overpriced. highly recommended. i am definitely going back!"

            "for whatever reason, my friend and i felt the need to fly 5+ hours to eat at two restaurants that have locations in ny (nobu and craftsteak), but whatever.  the food here was good, but i felt like the waiter was pushing us to order a ridiculous amount of food which would have been a total waste for my friend and i.  the hamachi <mark>Yellowtail and Jalapeno</mark> appetizer was quite good and of course, i had to order the miso black cod, which was good, but not the best fish i've ever eaten (in fact, the fish my friend got was better.)  the drinks were decent.  all told, a nice meal, but pretty expensive.", 
            "the visit was on a labor day sunday around 6pm.  the last visit to this particular nobu was back in 2003 when i didn't know the difference between a piece of foie and a rubber sole.  i recall having the chef special back then as well, but the omakase this time was definitely more enjoyable.  this was probably due to the fact that i wasn't three sheets to the wind this time.  being married does these things.\n\nthere were those that chose the bronze omakase ($100) and those that went for the silver ($150) like yours truly, and boy was there ever a difference.  there were major discrepancies between the cuts and also the types of meats served.  the sashimi and the speciality dishes also had noticeable differences.  it's not to say that the 100 dollar omakase wasn't good, but it wasn't great...at least from my vantage point.\n\nthere's about a zillion details i will be leaving out, such as the dried flakes of hoo-haa sprinkled with a drizzle of the thinger thang.  so use your imagination..\n\ncourse 1 - a bonito sashimi.\ncourse 2 - amaebi splashed with hot oil, chawan mushi with truffle and crab eggs at the bottom, kampachi sashimi with dried miso flakes.\ncourse 3 - toro sashimi <mark>King Crab with Amazu Ponzu</mark> ginger sauce <mark>Yellowtail and Jalapeno</mark> sauce topped with a bunch of edible flowers which made it all purdy and crap.\ncourse 4 - seared <mark>Scallop</mark> on a bed of sea beans.\ncourse 5 - kobe beef (served medium) with pan fried <mark>Teppan Style Foie Gras</mark>.\ncourse 6 - sushi set (nigiri) <mark>Inaniwa Pasta with Lobster</mark> broth and <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark>.  the set consisted of - toro, abalone, spanish mackerel, eel, tai (<mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark>) and tamago.\ncourse 7 - an array of sweets including <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark>, chocolate looking souffle thing, fresh fruits and other sugary confections we couldn't stay for because we were already late for the friggin cirque du pouffay show.\n\n..\n\nall in all, a great meal.  i enjoyed the silver omakase at matsuhisa better, the wife liked this dinner much better.  definitely a strong 4 star, but nowhere near a five.  the highlight of the meal for me was the foie served over the kobe.  the dish was so luxurious i really was at a loss for words as i was enjoying every delectable bite.  the slice of black truffle in the chawan mushi gives you a big mule kick in the face which was in short, heavenly.  \n\ni was surprised to find that i liked the non sushi dishes better than the raw, but is it such a huge surprise?  we live in cities like la, sf, ny, etc. where quality ingredients are so readily available.  i've had sashimi as good if not better in other restaurants.  most don't serve it with the detail and ingenuity like mr. nobu matsuhisa, but it takes way too much money to surprise this sushi cowboy.\n\ni truly don't mean to sound snobbish, but there's only so many ways to serve up a nice slab of toro.  i'm more impressed these days by the way chefs serve up foie.  and i am totally infatuated with bone marrow.\n\n..\n\ni've said too much.  \n\ni am off to eat.\n\nedit:\n\ni don't know if it was because we were in vegas, but i felt like everything was a bit contrived.\n\n*shrugs*", 
            "i ate here for a business dinner and sat at one of the tables but ordered omakase from the sushi bar.\n\nmy colleagues and i went big and went with $150 a person so we had high expectations...\n\ni will try my best to remember everything that came out...(not in order)\n\nthe first dish was a salmon trout sahimi with ikura eggs inside.  the fish had some chewy veins in it, and there wasn't any type of sauce on it - i guess we were supposed to enjoy the 2 components together.\n\nthere was a dish of fatty tuna (otoro) on top of a rock salt.  this was unique and the fish was melty\n\nthere was a <mark><mark>Lobster <mark>Miso Soup</mark></mark></mark> type dish that came out that used delicious dashi broth - anyone who understands umami would've enjoyed this\n\nkobe beef with special mayo sauce was good, but nothing spectacular\n\n<mark>Scallop</mark> in a green guacamole sauce was edible, but the balance wasn't completely there\n\nkanpachi <mark>King Crab with Amazu Ponzu</mark> sauce <mark>Yellowtail and Jalapeno</mark> was good too but trendy\n\nin the end, a full platter of sushi came with the trademark \"nobu\" mark on the egg sushi - this was perhaps the most dissapointing.  the fish tasted bland, the rice was somewhat hardened like it was sitting out for a while, and i really would've liked to end the night on a high note but this last platter of mediocre sushi ended the night on a low note\n\nand the bill at the end was not a pretty sight...\n\ni probably will not go back to nobu again unless it's free.  i was just expecting so much more because of all the hype.  \n\nhowever on the plus side the service is excellent - the servers are all very attentive.  and the atmosphere, being inside the hard rock hotel, is hip and lively.", 
            "i've read about celebrities going to nobu.  my friend talked about nobu like it was a god of sorts.  when we found out we had a table waiting for us at nobu, i was ready to go and feast myself on its delights.  we ordered: the miso black cod, salmon nigiri, a <mark>Soft Shell Crab</mark> roll, the hamachi <mark>Yellowtail and Jalapeno</mark> appetizer, the <mark>Mushroom Salad</mark>, a vegetarian cut roll, and the tiradito.  to drink i had the cucumber martini.  it was seriously one of the best drinks i have ever had.  it tasted like it was made with lychee vodka, and was smooth, refreshing and not too sweet.  unfor<mark>Tuna (Big Eye)</mark> our positive experience ended there.  after waiting an hour for our table, we had ordered about 15 cucumber martinis and was dying for some water.  we sat at our table and for 9 people, 2 drink menus were placed on the table and then we were ignored.  i glanced at the menus, waited.  our waiter came by and i asked him for waters all around and food menus.  15 minutes go by.  we had no water, and no menus.  finally, we're given 5 menus for 9 people, as he handed me the last menu, he left saying \"we're a little short on menus.\"  we shared our menus and within 3 minutes he was back asking us what we were going to have.  we asked him for some suggestions, and he pretty much just brushed us off.  we finally ordered the hamachi <mark>Yellowtail and Jalapeno</mark>.  before i could order anything else, he rushes off.  the next time we saw him he is dropping of a plate of hamachi <mark>Yellowtail and Jalapeno</mark>.  pretty much the whole night, he just ran off with us halfway through ordering and as a result, we were unable to dine together.  i can only speak for the <mark>Mushroom Salad</mark> and vegetable cut roll.  the vegetable cut roll was pretty good, i mean, steamed <mark>Vegetable</mark>, wrapped in a cucumber wrap, with a little ponzu sauce.  the <mark>Mushroom Salad</mark> was pretty gross.  the mushrooms were varied; trumpets, oysters, shiitake, enoki.  the sauce it was cooked in was sour and as a result made the mushrooms taste bad.  everyone else thought the hamachi <mark>Yellowtail and Jalapeno</mark> were pretty good, and they loved the miso black cod.  everything else, however, they said was mediocre.  mediocreness is ok, if it wasn't coupled with poor service and a $400+ bill.  when the bill came, we inquired about the drinks on the bill as we thought we had taken care of them all at the bar.  his response?  \"no you didn't, but you can just take it out of my tip.\"  i secretly think that everybody raves about this place so much because they don't want to admit they spent that much money on a mediocre experience that you can get anywhere in san francisco for a quarter of the price.  overall verdict:  skip it.  the atmosphere is not really that great, the food isn't really that great, and the service should not be called service.  the pros: the cucumber martini was super good.", 
            "so we had reservations for 930 on a friday night and were seated immediately upon our arrival. the (almost all-male)staff were attentive, informative and friendly. \n\nour meal:\n\n-edamame with shaved seasalt\n-sashimi yellowtail <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark> <mark>Yellowtail and Jalapeno</mark> (yummmmy, bobby's favorite)\n-black cod in lettuce cups with filo flakes (my favorite, so perfect)\n-sashimi <mark>Squid 'Pasta' with Light Garlic</mark> chips (little too salty)\n-salmon sushi\n-toro sushi (very tasty fish)\n-dessert: edamame <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark> atop a brownsugar brownie,caramel sauce, and tiny sliver of decadent brittle...the <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark> scoop was so tiny that we really couldn't taste the edamame. \n\na super treat for sushi, but be prepared to spend money!!", 
            "seriously delicious!  the first time i went to a sushi place and didn't have any rolls or rice!  we didn't order but had the waiter bring out their best dishes and everything was absolutely amazing!  the cod wraps and crab and rockshrimp were my favorite as well as their signature <mark>Yellowtail and Jalapeno</mark> dish.  they put together a spread of their <mark>Dessert</mark>, so got a little taste of everything.  oh and had the best riesling ever!  i will post pictures of their best dishes!\n\nand even though the chef was busy, he did come out to greet us which was really nice!\n\ni would highly recommend and want to go back!", 
            "it was good. it was very, very good. i particularly recommend the tuna <mark>Yellowtail and Jalapeno</mark> sashimi (and i don't normally eat raw fish, but i wasn't going to pass it up this time) and the cod that comes on a lettuce leaf with a little shredded, toasted phyllo on top. \n\nour waiter was patient with us, and helped us decide even though we were a bit clueless. the service is fast once you make up your mind about what to eat; and we ordered in waves, which the kitchen was fine with. \n\nthe only reason this wasn't a 5-star experience is that the room is small, crowded, dark, and noisy. we were literally reading the menus with the lights from our cellphones. the price of everything probably also weighs into my decision not to give the place 5 stars. for five of us to eat enough not to be starving but not to be totally full either was more than $300, and that includes one drink apiece.", 
            "this is one of my favorite places to eat in vegas. the first time i ate there last year in june during a conference and thought \"i'd fly here to eat\". then i went back the second night. i've been back twice since then and it doesn't disappoint. in the 4 times i've eaten there i've sat in the bar 3 times. i like the casual vibe and the waiter remembered me from months ago. \n\nwe always start with the shrimp app that is deep fried and covered in deliciousness. i compare it to the bang bang shrimp at bonefish, but nobu's is better. \n\nwe had the miso cod again, and it was even better this time. we also had several roles. i wasn't blown away with the yellow tail <mark>Yellowtail and Jalapeno</mark>, but found the tempura shrimp very good. we got the <mark>Scallop</mark> in garlic sauce and they are incredible, soft, moist and the flavor is wonderful. i like to let the bar tender make some suggestions but the favorites are absolutely the shrimp, cod and <mark>Scallop</mark>. next time we will have to try something a bit different!", 
            "i came to nobu on my literal first night ever in vegas, and returned recently to discover that if anything, it's only gotten better with time.\n\non this visit we did a five-course chef's tasting menu that featured the signature dishes of the restaurant. \n\nmy favorites were the delicate, flavorful <mark>Yellowtail and Jalapeno</mark> sashimi, crispy rock shrimp (which i devoured, despite not being a big shrimp eater), the restaurant's legendary, comforting and savory miso cod.\n\nour server was passionate and knowledgeable about wine and sake pairings, and the service in general, all across the board, was impeccable.\n\nnobu is a genre-defining restaurant, then and now."

            "if it were possible, i'd give nobu 4.5 stars. \n\nmy sweetie and i spent a few days in las vegas this week and went out to high-profile restaurants every night.\n\nall of the food we ordered was absolutely delicious, perfectly cooked and seasoned.  the sushi and sashimi were served at the perfect temperature, and everything tasted absolutely fresh.  \n\nspicy miso chips w/scallop sashimi\nsquid pasta\nmiso-glazed black cod - (a nobu specialty and the best piece of fish i've ever eaten)\na selection of sashimi and sushi including yellowtail, fluke, salmon avocado roll, <mark>Yellowtail and Scallion</mark> roll.\nflourless chocolate cake <mark>Bento Box</mark> - (as a pastry chef, i'm pretty wary of the whole \"flourless chocolate lava cake\" trend, but this one was fabulous, perfect texture and molten center,  served with white chocolate sauce and green tea <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark>. yum!)\n\ni'd say the prices were quite reasonable as well.  keep in mind this -is vegas, people.  after checking out -many- of the restaurant menus in other hotels i'd say nobu was absolutely less expensive, and there's no way you're going to get better food quality.\n\nthe only half star missing would be for the quality of the service.  the clearing and mise en placing of the table was fabulous, but our waiter was a little too casual.  he seemed almost on the verge of <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> us as \"guys\" or calling my sweetie \"boss\".  nothing wrong with being friendly, but lets face it this isn't a diner.  a little more dignity would have been appropriate.  luckily, the professionalism of the runners made up for it.  \n\nyay nobu!", 
            "i really wanted to try nobu after having an amazing experience at morimoto in philly.  i was not disappointed.  we arrived promptly at our reservation time and were seated immediately.  upon being seated we were greeted by our server within moments.    the atmosphere at nobu is much different than morimoto...nobu is more lively and trendy.  \n\nthey have you order a few dishes from the three parts of their menu.  we started with the oysters and the <mark><mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark></mark> which is served in lettuce wraps.  the lettuce wraps were quite good and the oysters were very earthy tasting. \n\nfor our second course we chose the <mark>Creamy Spicy Crab</mark> and the rock <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark> in butter ponzu.  the <mark>Creamy Spicy Crab</mark> may be one of the best dishes i've ever tasted in a restaurant.  at the end of our weekend i asked my brother in law what his favorite thing was about vegas and he responded without hesitation \"eating <mark>Creamy Spicy Crab</mark> at nobu.\"  not the club, not winning $300, not seeing old friends....the <mark>Creamy Spicy Crab</mark>.  \n\nwe chose 4 sushi rolls for our main course, the house roll which is like a rainbow row except the fish on the inside, a spider roll, unagi avocado (not on the menu but they happily prepared it for us) <mark>Yellowtail and Scallion</mark>.  each of the rolls was well prepared and the fish was fresh.\n\nfor dessert we ordered assorted mochi, which caused brother in law to wet himself for the second time that night.  our assortment included tiramisu, pistachio, honeydew, and raspberry.   all were amazing.\n\nthe service was outstanding throughout the night.  the meal was well paced, it wasn't the lingering three hour affair we had at morimoto but we didn't feel rushed at any point.  in the end i felt that the bill was actually fairly reasonable for what we ordered.  including tip and alcohol it came to about $90 a person.  i do have to <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> it did bother me slightly to find that some of the customers were wearing sneakers, open toe sandals (on men) and collarless shirts.  when i made our reservation they informed me that the dress code did not include these things, which is totally fine.  i'm all for getting dressed up to go out to eat, especially in vegas, and especially at a place like nobu, but i do not like it when i go through the effort and others don't have to.", 
            "nobu is my fave chain restaurant. this wasn't one of my fave locations. i feel the decor was not up to par with other locations such as nobu 57, nobu berkley or nobu in west hollywood. the food and service on the other hand are always top notch. they had my favourite wine (joh.jos. prum) which they seem to only have in 1/2 of their locations. the prices at this location seemed to be on the high side. $40 for 2 pieces of toro sushi, which is usually a staple for me but i decided to pass on it)\n\nfood\nyellow tail <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> \n<mark>Imported Wagyu <mark>Lobster <mark>Tuna <mark>King Crab <mark>Vegetable <mark>Salmon Nobu Style Taco</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark>- beef and tuna\nbeef tataki\n<mark>Tenderloin of Beef</mark> toban yaki- yummy\n<mark>Toro (Blue Fin) <mark>Yellowtail and Scallion</mark></mark> roll\n\ni would highly recommend any of these dishes",

(see below for kristine n's review). they prepared it with about 20 pieces of sashimi on the plate for our big party! it was great!\r\n\r\n<mark><mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> Salad</mark> - of course i had to order this! i love the salad dressing. \r\n\r\nmiso black cod - the cool thing about nobu is that because we had a group of 8, they actually cut the fish in chunks and put them individually on little lettuce wraps so it would be easier to eat. this was fantastic and sweet.\r\n\r\nchilean sea bass w/ mushrooms - the bride-to-be is a sea bass connoisseur and she said this was not chilean sea bass, but just regular sea bass. it was still very good though. yummm.\r\n\r\nsquid pasta - i love the squid pasta here. complimented w/ asparagus. i love asparagus!\r\n\r\nrock <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark> - we choose the butter sauce since the other sauces had been a bit spicy. yummy.\r\n\r\n<mark>Bento Box</mark> - flourless chocolate cake with <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark>. this was better than i remembered from nyc. it's not flourless as in a chocolate bar on a plate - it actually does have a cake - souffle texture to it. it was great, and gooey in the middle. \r\n\r\nmango caramel ice-cream dessert - a light but tasty dessert with caramel bits in it.\r\n\r\none of the girls and i are not big seafood fans, but we loved all the dishes here. (see below for kristine n.'s review!) that tells ya something! everyone thoroughly enjoyed this meal which made me happy because i hoped they would trust my judgement in food. =)\r\n\r\nit was nice because they brought out each dish one-by-one so you aren't stuffing your faces all at once. by the end of the dinner, we felt extremely satisfied but not so full we were going to explode.\r\n\r\nyay, for nobu!!!", 
            "nobu is awesome. i've never been to a nobu before until this past weekend when i was in vegas for a bachelorette party. the decor inside the restaurant was pretty nice. service wasn't too bad, but it could have been a pinch better. felt like our waitress was spread out a little too thin and trying to cover too many tables, but when she was around, she gave us the time and explained things pretty thoroughly.\n\nmy favorite dish of the night was the <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> (i normally don't like raw fish, but this one was freaking awesome!), <mark><mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> Salad</mark> (i normally don't eat fields of green salad, but this was an exception!), miso black cod (very yummy), the <mark>Bento Box</mark> dessert was great (esp the chocolate flourless cake which was very soft) and the mango caramel <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark> dessert. the <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark> was lighted flavored mango and there were caramel bits in there that was just great. probably my favorite dessert that i've ever had.\n\noverall the food was fantastic. definitely would head back to nobu again next time i'm in vegas. they're opening one closeby and i'll be definitely dining there in the future.", 
            "if it were possible, i'd give nobu 4.5 stars. \n\nmy sweetie and i spent a few days in las vegas this week and went out to high-profile restaurants every night.\n\nall of the food we ordered was absolutely delicious, perfectly cooked and seasoned.  the sushi and sashimi were served at the perfect temperature, and everything tasted absolutely fresh.  \n\nspicy miso chips w/scallop sashimi\nsquid pasta\nmiso-glazed black cod - (a nobu specialty and the best piece of fish i've ever eaten)\na selection of sashimi and sushi including yellowtail, fluke, salmon avocado roll, <mark>Yellowtail and Scallion</mark> roll.\nflourless chocolate cake <mark>Bento Box</mark> - (as a pastry chef, i'm pretty wary of the whole \"flourless chocolate lava cake\" trend, but this one was fabulous, perfect texture and molten center,  served with white chocolate sauce and green tea <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark>. yum!)\n\ni'd say the prices were quite reasonable as well.  keep in mind this -is vegas, people.  after checking out -many- of the restaurant menus in other hotels i'd say nobu was absolutely less expensive, and there's no way you're going to get better food quality.\n\nthe only half star missing would be for the quality of the service.  the clearing and mise en placing of the table was fabulous, but our waiter was a little too casual.  he seemed almost on the verge of <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> us as \"guys\" or calling my sweetie \"boss\".  nothing wrong with being friendly, but lets face it this isn't a diner.  a little more dignity would have been appropriate.  luckily, the professionalism of the runners made up for it.  \n\nyay nobu!", 
            "hubby's review is 2 stars.  here's what he has to say....\n\nfood was slightly better than ok.  \nprices were too fucking expensive!  \nwould never go back.   \n\nhere's what i have to say....3.5 stars\n\ni'm a lot more wordy than hubby so get ready....\n\nour waiter was snooty.  the prices are beyond outrageous.  the menu was extremely complicated.  i am no japanese dining expert, but i've eaten at my fair share of japanese restaurants from fine dining to hole in the wall and for the life of me i could not figure out how to order off of this menu...even after asking the waiter a barage of questions.  it didn't help that we were dining with 2 other couples, one of which did not want to be there, and half of the other couple didn't even like japanese food...don't ask.  i digress.  \n\nthe food we did figure out how to order was pretty damn good.  the rolls were good, the tuna sashimi fresh and delicious, the tempura was cooked perfectly....and the chili beef and teryiaki chicken all very good.  \n\nbut the 2 best parts about nobu for me were the belini martini's (i had two to kick off my night of martinis) and the <mark>Bento Box</mark> dessert.  the dessert was absolutely heavenly.  a flourless chocolate cake filled with a warm ooozy chocolate sauce topped with fresh raspberries and served with a scoop of green tea <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark>, it was one of the best <mark>Dessert</mark> i have ever had!  \n\nit's too bad hubby says he won't go back. i think if we had ordered differently and accepted the fact that it costs a small fortune to dine here, we might get to a good solid 4 stars.", 
            "fun experience! no privacy...: when we were seated i was disappointed that we were elbow to elbow with other couples on either side- no chance of a romantic dinner (or a private conversation for that matter). at one point the couple next to us leaned over to discuss one of our selections! the place is small <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> crowded. although i frequent japanese and sushi restaurants this menu contained many things i had never had before. most of the items are appetizer sized and quite pricey, considering the size (~$14-25). we chose items off the hot, cold and sushi sections. \nthe yellowtail tartar was great, the <mark><mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark></mark> was not so. the tempura rock shrimp were excellent, just a bunch of fried shrimp on a plate (popcorn-shrimp size). we tried the <mark>House Special</mark> (a rainbow roll) and eel sushi. both were good, but not my favorite rolls i'd ever had-actually kind of plain. for dessert the <mark>Bento Box</mark>, essentially a souffl", 
            "very very good. hard to say that it lived up to the hype, but i thought the omakase was good value for $100. i went with my parents and they also ordered the omakase. the waiter tempted us with the $150 omakase containing \"dishes not on the menu\", but being our first time at nobu, we went with the cheaper omakase. the dishes (as best as i can remember from my pics), in order: (cold-hot-sushi-soup-dessert)\n\n1) toro with spicy miso and caviar - wow, definitely one of the highlights of the omakase. super juicy, melt-in-your-mouth toro topped with a bit of caviar and sitting in a nice spicy miso sauce. omg so good. there was an interesting tiny japanese peach on the side to cleanse the palate.\n\n2) hawaiian <mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> sashimi - very nice texture and mix of flavors with the a citrus sauce, spot of spicy sauce, a sprinkle of black sea salt, and . not sure if it's on the regular menu, maybe it's called something else.\n\n3) kampachi and <mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> sashimi - super exotic and tasty. i didn't even know what kampachi was until i looked it up. apparently it's hawaiian yellowtail farmed in the open ocean off the kona coast of the big island. the trout was also very good. it looks a bit like salmon, but tastes a lot better. served with a nice miso-based sauce (i think) on the side, a couple small veggie sushi rolls, a roasted jalapeno, and a small, yellow, pear-shaped tomato sliced in half.\n\n4) black cod w/ miso - this dish really did live up to the hype. i was about to order it separately in case it did not come with the omakase, but our waiter said it is normally included in the $100 omakase since it's a very popular dish. omg so good. such delicate flavors and texture. amazing. i normally don't like to eat fish skin, but this skin is super good and flavorful. the cod is very light and flaky, but not dry. wow, this is a must try if you come to nobu.\n\n5) beef tenderloin w/ shiitake mushroom <mark>Tuna (Big Eye) and Asparagus</mark> - i didn't think this was that special and probably would not order off the regular menu. it was very good tenderloin though, cooked to a perfect medium rare, with a light sauce. it is served in a sizzling mini cast iron plate.\n\n6) nigiri sushi platter - delicious nigiri, super fresh, and most pieces i normally wouldn't order myself, but were interesting to try. tuna (best i've had in awhile), <mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark>, aji, giant clam, and sweet shrimp. mmm\n\n7) <mark><mark>Lobster <mark>Miso Soup</mark></mark></mark> w/ clams - pretty standard <mark><mark>Lobster <mark>Miso Soup</mark></mark></mark> with a few clams inside. the clams and miso is a good combination, but they can be tricky to fish out and eat with only chopsticks. i cheated on one of them and used two fingers to hold the shell. ;p\n\n8) flourless chocolate cake w/ green tea <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark> - a generous portion served in a cute <mark>Bento Box</mark>. nothing too spectacular or interesting, but delicious nonetheless. the cake was still nice and molten inside when it arrived. yum!\n\na pretty filling flight of dishes for $100. i thought it was good value to try many dishes, but i haven't seen the sizes of the normal dishes. many tables around us also ordered the omakase, as i heard the same descriptions being recited by the staff over and over. i over heard a table of french tourists behind us ordering california rolls, chicken teriyaki, tempura, and other generic stuff you can get anywhere. sigh, what a waste.\n\ni would recommend not to order anything not on the \"hot\" of \"cold\" specialty pages of the menu. the rest is basically traditional japanese fare you can get anywhere, but will probably taste better and cost a lot more at nobu. service was good, polite, and attentive. it was a bit odd when our waiter brought out the first few dishes, and then a couple other different guys brought out some of the following ones. weird.\n\nthe decor is basic, but nothing too special. the sushi bar looks cool and there's a pretty wall of bamboo poles at the back as you walk in. my parents like to eat early, so we moved our reservation to 6pm when they are supposed to open. when we arrived a few minutes early, the door was locked and they didn't seem ready yet. ten minutes later, they were ready. better to come early though, or your omakase may take two hours or longer to get through. ours took about 90 minutes because it wasn't that crowded until after 7.\n\ni think the tenderloin and dessert could have been better and more creative. otherwise, nearly flawless.\n\nif i ever return for a special occasion, i will definitely need to try the $150 omakase. with the economy in shambles, i kinda feel bad eating such an expensive dinner. for<mark>Tuna (Big Eye)</mark>, my parents picked up the tab tonight as i had paid last night at the painted pony. maybe in 2009 they will have a recession special, like gray's papaya. ;p", 
            "the <mark>Black Cod Miso</mark> cod got me. i loveeeeeee it. the ambiance was beautiful. i wish i came more hungry to try everything else. but omg their flourless chocolate molten cake with the green tea <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark> (<mark>Bento Box</mark>) topped the night. the best i've ever had. i wish i didnt have to share it with two other girls....hehe.\n\ni would def be back here in the near future.", 
            "i'm not going to lie--a small part of me dies every time i think about how much we spent here.  but the truth of the matter is, you can't get good sushi without paying for it.  \n\nwe ordered the $100 omakase, the uni tempura set, kabocha tempura, and salmon sashimi.\n\nthe fusion dishes (like the hamachi <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> or the snapper with cucumber <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Whole <mark>1/2 Maine Lobster</mark></mark> <mark>Roasted Poussin with Spicy Lemon</mark></mark> juice) were fun to try but i find that the sauces often overpower the fish, which is the best thing about nobu.  if you have never tried any of their signature dishes, you might want to order at least one of the omakase options, but if you're just looking to enjoy the fish qua fish, then order the sashimi and/or nigiri a la carte.\n\nand yes, let's talk about the fish.  i have never had such a wonderfully buttery miso black cod!  and the toro, maguro, aji, trout, and sake (as in salmon sashimi) simply melted in our mouths.  no biting necessary.  the only low point was that the anago in our complimentary sushi was littered with small fish bones but hey, it was complimentary!  yet another reason why i love nobu.  they know how to treat the ladies right.\n\nas for the tempura, the kabocha was out of season, so it was our bad for ordering it in the first place, but the uni tempura was unlike anything i have ever had.  every bite was bursting with succulence and the tempura batter <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> extra texture and flavor.  heavenly.  anyone who is a fan of uni and/or tempura needs to try this!  it also comes with tempura shiitake mushroom (luxuriously juicy), tempura shiso leaf (so crispy, so light), and one other <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark> that i forget but that my mom thought was delicious.\n\nthe dessert was lovely too--we had the <mark>Bento Box</mark> which consists of flourless chocolate cake and homemade green tea <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark>.  not too sweet and the perfect way to end a perfect meal.\n\ni seriously cannot wait to come back here again and try the <mark>Hamachi Kama</mark>, the snapper, the whole fried fish, and the squid salad.  is it expensive?  yes.  but is it worth it?  most definitely.", 
            "wow. i was seriously impressed with this place. this place ranks second to french laundry on my list of favorites. \n\nfirst- if you are a first time visitor there, i would recommend just ordering off of the menu. i am sure the omakase is great but you have to try the signature dishes- and you may not get to try them all with the omakase. \n\nsecond- don't have the sushi be your primary focus. it's okay- but the other items are so much better. we saw people around us doing nothing but order sushi- what a waste! \n\nthird- the warm dishes tended to be larger portions than the cold and raw dishes. just a fyi if you want to budget your appetite and your wallet. i also felt that the dishes with a tart factor (see below) were too overwhelming. i would pass on these- imo the tartness is so much you can't enjoy the other flavors that might be there. \n\nwe started with edammame and the sheshito peppers. pass on the edamamme - there is nothing great about it- and you don't need to fill up your tummy with average stuff. the sheshito peppers were really good. they taste like small green bell peppers and the miso and sesame sauce on top has a great flavor. my husband is so picky when it comes to veggies and he even enjoyed this. my only word of caution- occasionally you get a spicy one! \n\nso we relied on our fellow yelpers and ordered the following items: \n\n1. <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> - definitely get this- it was awesome! \n\n2. the blackened miso cod- by far, the highlight of the evening \n\n3. chilean sea bass- cooked the special of the day way (yummy)- it had tomatoes, and onions, some white wine sauce \n\n4. kobe beef on skewers- pass- it was okay but not great \n\n5. <mark><mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark></mark>- pass- the tartness was way too overwhelming \n\n6. red <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark> - pass- again, tartness too overwhelming \n\n7. then we ordered some basic filler items- tempura, sushi (ca rolls and ama ebi)- all which were fine. \n\n8. we ordered the <mark>Bento Box</mark> dessert- it was ok- not fantastic. \n\noverall- the meal was great. the <mark>Black Cod Miso</mark> cod was so good- it had the right blend of sweetness with saltiness, and the fish was so tender it literally melts in your mouth. the chilean sea bass had the same texture and effect, but it costs about twice the amount as the black cod (a tidbit for those of you who are watching the $$s). \n\nwe had starved ourselves earlier in the day and were totally stuffed by the end of the meal. the whole meal with tip was just over $300. i highly recommend this place. it was the only restaurant that we went to in the older part of vegas that was great.", 
            "this is my second time here and both times i've come with my cousin. as much i love nobu, i only go there with her, since she loves it so much, but i never regret it. \n\nthe nice thing is i just let her order, since she knows what's good, but then if i ever go alone, i won't really know what to order. i did have a nice acai cocktail to start the night. it was delicious and refreshing, great way to start the meal. \n\nwe ordered the <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> which i loved since i love the spice. then we had the seafood spring rolls which weren't on the menu, but since they go there all the time, they knew about it. those were also really good, along with the <mark><mark>Nobu's Moriawase Sashimi Salad</mark></mark>. loved the dressing and there was so much sashimi! we also had the rock <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark>, which was kinda like popcorn shrimp, but really tasty <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> grilled beef thing. \n\nat the end, we ordered the <mark>Bento Box</mark>, which was a flourless chocolate cake with green tea <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark>. everything was really good, but service was a little slow. my other friends were also there and they were a party of 10. they started a little after us but finished before us!! other than that though, it was a great night.", 
            "went here on a saturday night. we got there at 10:30pm and it was still packed. we ordered the yellowtail sashimi w/ jalapeno, very good. followed by the <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark> roll and <mark><mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark></mark>, both were good. i wouldn't say anything spectacular but good nevertheless. the best for last, the <mark>Black Cod Miso</mark> lettuce wrap was very good. it's sweet, buttery, hot & cold, soft & crunchy. the dish was the highlight of the evening. the gf enjoyed the miso immensely. we also had the <mark>Bento Box</mark> dessert, simple but good. service was good to us.\n\nbeing nobu, you pay a pretty penny for a small amount of food. ok...you'll drop a few bills here. but it's worth going to, esp. if you never been.", 
            "it was saturday night in vegas, we wanted sushi, and nobu didnt even cross my mind until my boyfriend made reservations for the same night. i quickly logged on to yelp to check the latest reviews as i do with any restaurant, and i am happy to say that i am ecstatic i did this, because had i not, i would have missed out on the black cod <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark>.... which is without a doubt, one the best things that i have ever tasted. \n\nmy bf and i shared 4 dishes and 1 dessert, washed it down with 2 sapporo's each, and by the time we were done, we could barely walk!\n\n<mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> - delicious!!!! the sauce may be just a bit overpowering but delicious nonetheless. i couldnt even taste the jalapeno :)\n\n<mark><mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark></mark> - i have no clue why they are calling this \"ceviche\" but i wish we would have ordered something else instead. it was merely ok,  it just kind of tasted like cold <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> lettuce - but hey, i love <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark>  its all good :)\n\nblack cod <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark> - omg - i just got goosebumps thinking about this dish. it is hands down the best thing i have ever put in my mouth. i like how crunchy <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> it is..  delicioso~\n\n<mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark> roll - your basic roll ..  \n\n<mark>Bento Box</mark> dessert ( flourless chocolate cake with green tea <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark>) yum yum yum yum - this is a great combination - not too much,  shared <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> special is a perfect way to satisfy your sweet tooth.\n\nwill definitely come back - loved the all male service - everyone was really nice and our waiter pretty much gave us his thoughts on all the menu items and gave us some nice suggestions - that in hindsight, i should have taken.\n\n but hey, theyre's always next time!!", 
            "if it were only about the sushi, nobu would get 5 stars from me. but, i knock off 2 stars for service. we walked in on a saturday night and got seats at the sushi bar, which is the place to be. we went with our sushi chef's suggestions, which were nobu's <mark>House Special</mark>, including \"new-style sashimi.\" these consist of the best fish, <mark>White Fish <mark>Scallop <mark>Salmon <mark>Oyster <mark>Beef <mark>Yuba Sashimi New Style</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark>, with delicate sauces and garnishes: <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark>, live octopus with a peruvian chili paste, whitefish and salmon <mark>King Crab with Amazu Ponzu</mark> sauce, tuna <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark>-mustard sauce. everything was first-class, including the junmai daiginjo sake.\n\nthen, i ordered the <mark>Bento Box</mark> chocolate cake dessert. we were told it would take 8 minutes to cook. no problem - our bellies were happily full of sashimi. 20 minutes later, however, still no dessert, and we finally were able to flag someone down to check on it. another ten minutes went by. our waiter then came out to tell us there was a mixup in the kitchen and our cake went to another table. he tried to give us a plateful <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark> to tide us over - this didn't go over well, as the last thing we wanted was to eat a plateful <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark> and then a chocolate cake. another ten minutes or so, the dessert came out. it was excellent, but frankly wasn't worth waiting over half an hour for. we ask ed for the check while still eating...took another ten minutes...gave the credit card and another ten minutes went by...waiter came out to tell us the credit card isn't clearing and do we want to give another card? by this point, well over an hour had gone by since dessert was ordered and we just wanted to leave already. \n\nwhen our check finally arrived, they did charge us for the dessert that took over 30 minutes to arrive at our table. when i mentioned this to the server, he took it right off the bill. but i was miffed that i even had to ask - the right thing to do would have been to take it off in the first place.\n\ntoo bad, since up until we ordered dessert we were very pleased with the sushi our wonderful chef served us. even for a saturday night in vegas, the service was unacceptably unresponsive for such a high-end restaurant.", 
            "i adore nobu! i go there every time i'm in vegas!\n\nit is pricey, i spent $300 for dinner for two this past trip.....but it is sooooo worth it. \n\nmy picks: \n-hamachi w/ jalapenos\n-\"live\" octopus\n-tiradito \"live\" scallop\n-black cod <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark>\n-kobe beef (try tataki style)\n-<mark>Bento Box</mark> (chocolate cake with green tea <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark>)\n\nthough honestly, i've never had anything bad there. and try the nobu brand beer (made exclusively for them), i'm not a big beer drinker but it pairs really, really well with the food. \n\nthe waiters are always excellent. they know the entire menu, so feel free to ask them for recommendations. \n\nif you have to pick one nice, expensive dinner in vegas.....definitely pick nobu.", 
            "the food here was amazing! we've heard about nobu from a friend of ours and decided to have our valentines dinner here. our waiter suggested 4-5 dishes for the both of us. so, we ordered the monk fish liver <mark>Yellowtail or Salmon <mark>Blue Fin <mark>Toro Tartare</mark> with Royal Ossetra Caviar</mark></mark>, tuna sashimi, salmon tartar, black cod <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark>, uni and an order of the <mark>Soft Shell Crab</mark> roll for the fiance who doesn't enjoy much raw dishes. the food and not to mention the presentation was incredible. we enjoyed each and every dish. for dessert, we picked the <mark>Bento Box</mark> which includes warm valrhona chocolate souffle cake, shiso syrup, white chocolate sauce and green tea <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark> mmmmmmmmmmmmm. i'm so ready to go back and try more dishes on their menu.", 
            "before the concert started at the hard rock, i had enough time to sit down and have a fabulous dinner. at first i thought that steak might be a good idea, but i love asian food and wanted a great experience. my boyfriend and i walked into nobu, a japanese restaurant. for our first time there, we decided to ask for assistance with the menu, and chose several things from each part.\n\ntheir menu is broken up by sushi, cold, hot and specialties. we decided to go with a little bit of everything.\n\nour favorite was the <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark>, and the crab tempura with their special sauce. their tempura shrimp and <mark>Vegetable</mark> were great also.\n\noverall, for the price of 266 dollars for two people to eat out of a tasting menu, it was a great experience. i can't say much about their food because i have to say that i've eaten better tempura at our local asian restaurant, well being in the box.\n\nalthough their tempura was okay (it was too soft and not crispy at all), their sushi was as close to the guam experience as we could get. it was sweet, done perfect, and the sauces were impeccable.\n\ni honestly didn't feel that their tempura was worth the 200 dollar ticket. that was majority of our bill. i do believe that their signature <mark>Bento Box</mark> dessert was worth 14 dollars. it was creamy, a perfect souffle, and their green tea <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark> was just like home.\n\nif you want something other than tempura for your experience at nobu, it's worth the price tag and the trip. for myself, a good japanese restaurant serves light, crispy, and fluffy tempura the way i've had it in japan and on guam from top japanese chefs. however, this was not the case, unfor<mark>Tuna (Big Eye)</mark>.\n\ni give this restaurant my personal 3/5 stars.", 
            "i don't know about the ny or la counterparts, but......\n\nnobu lv must be the biggest scam in the history of fine dining.  i really wanted to like it because i didn't want to seem like a hater but seriously the decor is so uninspired (surfboards, bamboo, modern-classic clash) and the wait staff doesn't have the same refined elegance or grace as comparably priced restaurants.  just cuz you put on a black t-shirt and black slacks doesn't make it chic and modern -- unless you're steve jobs.\n\nwe had the <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> which was genius -- at least for the accountants.  the live scallop was sour and spicy but just too much of each.  the moi new sashimi special could have been any fish.  the miso cod was tasty and one of the highlights, but was served lukewarm.  the uni tempura dish was also pretty good but you only get 1 piece of uni.  the <mark>Bento Box</mark> and yuzu wasabi <mark>Dessert</mark> were ok too.\n\nwould i dine there if the food was 1/3 the price?  sure.  i just felt like i was getting duped and i wanted to scream out the king ain't wearing any clothes you idiots.  but then i realized between the loud noise of hard rock and the drunken stupor of the crowd , my efforts would be moot.", 
            "amazing black cod. amazing. so, so good. the <mark>White Fish <mark>Scallop <mark>Salmon <mark>Oyster <mark>Beef <mark>Yuba Sashimi New Style</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark> tataki is my second favorite. if you're considering yellowtail, do the sashimi even of you're tired of ponzu and jalape\\u00f1o. the yellowtail roll isn't as good. i mean, it's great, but i think the sashimi plate is a better deal with more flavor. like blair b. said, get the unique plates here.\n\nas a side note, nobu participated in the taste of the nation, las vegas, which is a fundraiser to end childhood hunger in nevada. nobu cares about our community. i really appreciate that!\n\nservice at nobu is really out of this world.\n\nnobu's <mark>Bento Box</mark> is my favorite dessert of all time, so much so that i replicate it at home with success--flour-less chocolate cake with green tea <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark> and hot fudge. lord have mercy i am in heaven!\n\nif you have the money, spend it on nobu.", 
            "i'll be honest. i came here for the dessert tasting platter. \n\ni saw the dessert list and died a little at the unique, creative and hitherto unknown creations being offered. so did my boyfriend. we decided we had to make it to nobu even if the apocalypse happened and giant flesh-eating gargoyles descended from the sky.\n\ni did not plan to have a full meal at all but wouldn't you know it, i did. ahhh, i love when upscale japanese restaurants live up to the hype.\n\nyellowtail with jalape\\u00f1o: tender slices of my fish soulmate in an amazing soy yuzu sauce with just a little kick. most perfect dish ever.\n\nbeef tenderloin tabu yaki: not quite as tender as kobe (is anything?) but delicious nonetheless.\n\n<mark>Spicy Scallop</mark> roll: fresh and tasty. the boyfriend was blown away by it, i thought it was good but otherwise unremarkable. i think raw scallop might be his yellowtail, though.\n\nblack cod <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark>: their signature dish. it's really hard to find fault with it. tender, melt-in-your-mouth fish in a sweet, light sauce. it should be heavy, but it's not. that's the miracle of japanese cooking.\n\n<mark>Spicy Seafood Soup</mark>: my favorite kind of food--soupy, spicy, seafoody. oh, and as an <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> bonus, loaded with more varieties of mushroom than a drug farmer. i have seen heaven and it's inside this bowl. get it!\n\nnow on to the nobu dessert platter:\n\n<mark>Bento Box</mark>: flourless chocolate cake with a white chocolate sauce, shiso syrup and green tea <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark>. like a japanese molten cake. did i mention that molten cake is like edible carnal sex? well, it is. so get this. just don't go all matrix reloaded in the restaurant.\n\ntrio of mochi: lessee, we got pumpkin spice, strawberry, <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> flavor not known to man, stuffed with ice-cream and accompanied by sour japanese mountain peaches. mmm...\n\nbananas in phyllo dough with tropical glaze: original creation not on the regular menu (haha!). it's crispy, fried bananas. need i say more?\n\nharom<mark>Aji (Jackfish)</mark> in cinnamon and sugar and center is sweet potato pur\\u00e9e: i totally didn't spell that right and since it's another original creation, i have no menu to look at. already tried googling and found nothing. anyway, this was incredible. i hate sweet potato and i thought this was da bomb. yeah, i'm channeling 2001 lingo.\n\neat here.", 
            "we stopped by nobu two nights ago and had a wonderful dinner.  we arrived and were seated at a booth....the decor of the restaurant was fairly trendy with an asian/bamboo wood theme.\n\nbased on the many yelp reviews we ordered the yellowfish <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark>, black cod w/ miso, <mark>Lobster <mark>Tuna <mark>King Crab <mark>Vegetable <mark>Salmon Nobu Style Taco</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark>, rock shrimp w/ 3 dipping sauces, the house sushi roll and the <mark>Bento Box</mark> desert (warm chocolate w/green tea <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark>).\n\neach item was outstanding.....great unique flavors for each dish.  our favs were the black cod w/miso and the rock shrimp.  super yummy!\n\nnobu rocks with a hit!\n\na cool michelin star restaurant in sin city!", 
            "the jalapeno yellow tail sashimi is one of the best things i've ever eaten. order the <mark>Bento Box</mark> for dessert (which they finally <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> to the lv menu) to share and it's just about as good as it gets.", 
            "let me preface this review by saying that i'm a huge self-admitted sushi <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> and my husband is peruvian, so nobu seemed a logical choice for our 7th anniversary dinner.  aside from the villainous penny slots  just outside the door, it was the perfect choice. \n\nwe started out with the <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark>.  yellowtail is by far my favorite raw fish and i've had a similar dish at several excellent bay area restaurants, but this was by far the most flavorful rendering of this dish that i've had. the sashimi was also not razor thin which was an awesome <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> bonus (honestly, i've gotten use to the fact that fine dining, particularly in vegas, means small portions and high prices so the amount of fish was a pleasant surprise. \n\nnext, we tried the tiradito nobu style <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> type of halibut like fish.  now, here the fish was razor thin, but came out with a dot of rocoto, a block of rock salt, the traditional lime juice and a side of cilantro.  my husband says this is exactly what tiradito is supposed to taste like, which makes me want to spend significantly more time in peru.  it was amazing.\n\nwe then moved on to the <mark>Black Cod Miso</mark> next and honestly, this was the only part of the meal that i was underwhelmed by.  i know that this is supposed to be the signature hot dish at nobu, but i've had a very similar dish at both morimoto napa and at hyakumi at cesar's palace and the texture of the fish wasn't the melt in your mouth awesomeness that i have come to expect from the dish. the flavor was right on, and if i'd never had black cod before, i would have loved it.  \n\nso, we moved back to the cold dishes and tried the <mark>White Fish <mark>Scallop <mark>Salmon <mark>Oyster <mark>Beef <mark>Yuba Sashimi New Style</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark> salmon sashimi (<mark>White Fish <mark>Scallop <mark>Salmon <mark>Oyster <mark>Beef <mark>Yuba Sashimi New Style</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark> because it's served with ginger, <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> other amazing deliciousnesss that i can't recall right now), finishing off the savory with the toro green onion maki (cut).  they were both amazing. \n\nwhat shocked me was how incredibly amazing the two <mark>Dessert</mark> we had were.  we tried the <mark>Bento Box</mark>, a flourless chocolate cake with house-made green tea <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark>, and this peach cobbler like dish with almond miso crumble and ginger <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark>.  i don't know if anyone else finds some green tea <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark> to sometimes taste vaguely like lipstick, but this <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark> was delicate and a beautiful companion to the rich chocolate cake.  the warm peaches with the crumble and (again not overpowering) ginger <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark> was a highlight of my whole trip to vegas.  (and i'm not really a dessert person)\n\nokay, this review is way too long, and i didn't even mention the impeccable service.  i can't wait to go back and wish there was a nobu in the bay area.", 
            "my expectations were pretty high when coming here.  for a notable restaurant, i expected a pretty damn good execution of everything.  \n\ni went with the omakase, consisting of 8 dishes including dessert.  some of the stand-outs included the hamachi tartare, the barracuda salad, and the dessert notably named \"<mark>Bento Box</mark>\".  \n\nthe <mark>Bento Box</mark> consisted of white chocolate sauce in a flourless chocolate cake, with green tea gelato and berries on the side.  a little excessive yes, but it was effective.  the first couple of rounds of the omakase were the cold dishes, which were acceptable, as i expected small portions of dishes to come out.  however, i was surprised (and almost annoyed with the second half of the omakase, which consisted of warm dishes that basically over-powering and excessive.  they could pretty much act as their own entree.\n\ntl;dr  the cold dishes are tiny, the warm dishes are a whole lot.\n\nwith that said, the price of $110 is worth the 8-course meal, but i was slightly annoyed at how small and then how big the proportions were.  the quality was fine, but i wasn't satisfied at the end.", 
            "this is, quite simply, the best food that i have ever eaten. i come here every two years for a packaging convention and i try to make nobu a treat for my key employees. it is expensive, to be sure, but the food is so worth it. \n\nthis is not a \"slap on the feed bag joint\".  it is meant to be enjoyed over a couple of hours.  the plates are small but are meant to be shared with friends. you should order a few plates so that each bite is savored and you get to try multiple kinds of food. hot and cold dishes with a japanese/peruvian flair. \n\ncold sake in a bamboo pitcher and shot glasses. \n\nwe had a few cold dishes...salmon, oysters, edamame, and a couple more.\n\nhot dishes of <mark>Black Cod Miso</mark> cod, sea bass, <mark>Scallop</mark>.....\n\n<mark>Bento Box</mark> flowerless chocolate cake, green tea <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark>, a peach dish and an apple donut plate that was beyond belief. \n\ngreat ambiance, service and food. a delicious treat.",

(fried so not a healthy choice).  and i ordered the chilean sea bass with dried miso... my all time favorite, which did not disappoint!  salmon, hamachi and unagi sushi... small but still so good.  and we ended with yet another cocktail :-) and the <mark>Bento Box</mark>.... flourless chocholate cake with white chocolate sauce and green tea <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark>... omg!  amazing dinner with outstanding service.  yes nobu is expensive but i was for<mark>Tuna (Big Eye)</mark> that he was so generous... so not really sure what our bill was... but so worth every bite.",

(see below for kristine n.'s review!) that tells ya something! everyone thoroughly enjoyed this meal which made me happy because i hoped they would trust my judgement in food. =)\r\n\r\nit was nice because they brought out each dish one-by-one so you aren't stuffing your faces all at once. by the end of the dinner, we felt extremely satisfied but not so full we were going to explode.\r\n\r\nyay, for nobu!!!",

            "if it were possible, i'd give nobu 4.5 stars. \n\nmy sweetie and i spent a few days in las vegas this week and went out to high-profile restaurants every night.\n\nall of the food we ordered was absolutely delicious, perfectly cooked and seasoned.  the sushi and sashimi were served at the perfect temperature, and everything tasted absolutely fresh.  \n\nspicy miso chips w/scallop sashimi\nsquid pasta\nmiso-glazed black cod - (a nobu specialty and the best piece of fish i've ever eaten)\na selection of sashimi and sushi including yellowtail, fluke, salmon avocado roll, <mark>Yellowtail and Scallion</mark> roll.\nflourless chocolate cake <mark>Bento Box</mark> - (as a pastry chef, i'm pretty wary of the whole \"flourless chocolate lava cake\" trend, but this one was fabulous, perfect texture and molten center,  served with white chocolate sauce and green tea <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark>. yum!)\n\ni'd say the prices were quite reasonable as well.  keep in mind this -is vegas, people.  after checking out -many- of the restaurant menus in other hotels i'd say nobu was absolutely less expensive, and there's no way you're going to get better food quality.\n\nthe only half star missing would be for the quality of the service.  the clearing and mise en placing of the table was fabulous, but our waiter was a little too casual.  he seemed almost on the verge of <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> us as \"guys\" or calling my sweetie \"boss\".  nothing wrong with being friendly, but lets face it this isn't a diner.  a little more dignity would have been appropriate.  luckily, the professionalism of the runners made up for it.  \n\nyay nobu!", 
            "when nobu opened in new york city, it created a sensation.  reservations were nearly impossible to get, and its new interpretation of traditional japanese food was widely praised.  this led to the inevitable branding of the restaurant; nobu can be found all over the globe.\n\nmeal #1: i found las vegas nobu's sushi highly variable.  the overall quality was ok, but some items (e.g., uni) were poor while others (e.g., ankimo) were good.  orange and honey flavored sake was interesting but probably not worth repeating.\n\n\nmeal #2:  since my first meal, i went to nobu in miami beach, sat in the dining room and had the omakase meal.  i enjoyed that a bit more, so decided to give the vegas location another shot.\n\nthe restaurant looks ok, but nothing great.  it's very noisy, in keeping with the hard rock atmosphere.  the crowd is mostly young, but i think anyone would feel comfortable here; i did.  service is pleasant, although all the servers are running around at full speed.\n\nnow, on to the meal:\n\n    * i chose jyunmai daiginjyo sake.  it wasn't bad, but was a trifle harsh.\n    * small japanese spring roll with balsamic vinaigrette reduction.  good.\n    * trio of raw seafood: sea scallop slice, oyster, ama ebi (raw shrimp).  all served with onion and other spices, although each was slightly different.  good.\n    * seared maguro and a slightly strong flavored fish, <mark>Squid 'Pasta' with Light Garlic</mark> chips and a pickled ginger shoot.  a good combination.  very good.\n    * uni (<mark>Sea Urchin</mark>) <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> white fish, served on sliced eggplant.  the uni was seared and was surprisingly delicious.  there was also a tiny river crab, to be eaten shell and all; interesting for the crunch, not the flavor.  very good.\n    * o toro and a spring roll <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> sauce and radish.  the o toro was good but a little chewy, and the strong sauce tended to overwhelm the tuna.  good to very good.\n    * palate cleanser: intensely flavored, sweet/sour mango sorbet, on top of a red granite with little flavor.\n    * service lapse.  up to this point, courses had been timed well.  at this point, i waited for about 15 minutes, with no explanation.  this was a little annoying.\n    * grilled sea scallop on a bed of mushrooms, bits of seafood, and brown rice.  very good.\n    * <mark>Teppan Style Foie Gras</mark> and kobe beef.  a large hunk of <mark>Teppan Style Foie Gras</mark>; good flavor.  kobe beef very good.  overall, very good to excellent.\n    * service lapse: the next course was supposed to be sushi, followed by <mark><mark>Lobster <mark>Miso Soup</mark></mark></mark>.  they reversed the order, and apologized later.  a minor matter.\n    * <mark><mark>Lobster <mark>Miso Soup</mark></mark></mark>.  better than average; good fish stock flavor, not too salty.  very good.\n    * sushi: o-toro (tuna belly), <mark>Shima Aji</mark> (variety of mackerel?), some kind of crab, unagi (eel).  very good.\n    * fruit papillote.  like a crepe.  the raspberry seeds were very distracting.  fair.\n    * honey <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark>.  very strong honey flavor.  strange, but i liked it.  very good.\n\noverall, the meal was good, but not as good as nobu in miami, and not nearly as good as okada.  at the price they charge ($120), they need to do better.\n\n\nmeal #3: based on past meals, i hadn't planned to return. however, i found myself at the hard rock hotel at meal time, and no other choices looked appealing. i decided to go for unusual choices, hoping this would be a strength. this worked out better. my selections:\n\n    * ankimo (steamed monkfish liver). standard but still very good.\n    * <mark>Hamachi Kama</mark> (grilled yellowtail collar). this is a chunk of fish, skin and bone, served grilled. it may not sound like much, and it's a little difficult to get the flesh out, but it's usually very rich and very tasty. i was both happy and sad with my choice: it was very good, but not as good as elsewhere. if you'd like to try this dish, order it robatayaki style at okada.\n    * live shrimp. these santa barbara shrimp were killed in front of me, so i guess that means they're fresh. they were big and rather chewy; i'm guessing the latter is due to their recent demise. the heads were served tempura style, and were juicy and tasty.\n    * live octopus. i'm not sure that it was live, but slices of the tentacle, served raw, were indeed very fresh tasting - and much less chewy than the cooked version. pretty good.\n\nthis was the most satisfying of my meals at nobu. nothing was stellar, but everything was good.\n\n\n\nnobu's strength is its new take on japanese foods.  its weaknesses are sushi that isn't in the same class with the better places in las vegas, and suspect service.  given such high prices, i'd look elsewhere.", 
            "hubby's review is 2 stars.  here's what he has to say....\n\nfood was slightly better than ok.  \nprices were too fucking expensive!  \nwould never go back.   \n\nhere's what i have to say....3.5 stars\n\ni'm a lot more wordy than hubby so get ready....\n\nour waiter was snooty.  the prices are beyond outrageous.  the menu was extremely complicated.  i am no japanese dining expert, but i've eaten at my fair share of japanese restaurants from fine dining to hole in the wall and for the life of me i could not figure out how to order off of this menu...even after asking the waiter a barage of questions.  it didn't help that we were dining with 2 other couples, one of which did not want to be there, and half of the other couple didn't even like japanese food...don't ask.  i digress.  \n\nthe food we did figure out how to order was pretty damn good.  the rolls were good, the tuna sashimi fresh and delicious, the tempura was cooked perfectly....and the chili beef and teryiaki chicken all very good.  \n\nbut the 2 best parts about nobu for me were the belini martini's (i had two to kick off my night of martinis) and the <mark>Bento Box</mark> dessert.  the dessert was absolutely heavenly.  a flourless chocolate cake filled with a warm ooozy chocolate sauce topped with fresh raspberries and served with a scoop of green tea <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark>, it was one of the best <mark>Dessert</mark> i have ever had!  \n\nit's too bad hubby says he won't go back. i think if we had ordered differently and accepted the fact that it costs a small fortune to dine here, we might get to a good solid 4 stars.", 
            "i agree with ming-jou in the fact that i was totally disappointed at this place. i should have also listened to my friend who went there and was really disappointed at their omakase, but being japanese, i wanted to try their food to see what the hype was about.  we had reservations at 9 pm and although we got there earlier, they didn't seat us till then.  it was shockingly a loud place that we often had to yell at each other to talk and even to order.  also, the crowd was much older than i anticipated.  the interior had a nice asian feel to it with bamboos everywhere, even on the ceilings.\n\nfor starters, we had edamame, yellowtail tartar <mark>Yellowtail or Salmon <mark>Blue Fin <mark>Toro Tartare</mark> with Royal Ossetra Caviar</mark></mark>, <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark>.  the menu was vague that we didn't expect any sauce with the tartar, but to our surprise, it came in a sauce with wasabi that was a little spicy.  i wish the menu would have included more details.  we got to order individual tempura items, which was a \"first\" for me.  we ordered shrimp, broccoli, and sweet potato.  the order came with 2 pieces each.  i liked how it came out really hot with light batter.  also, they were generous with their tempura sauce with daikon-oroshi (grated daikon).  most places give you barely enough sauce.  for dinner, we shared the <mark>Sushi Dinner</mark> which came with 8 nigiri and 6 pieces of tekka maki (<mark>Big Eye Tuna Roll</mark>).  the sushi rice tasted old as it was cold and flat, not warm and plump.  also, the rice portion for a nigiri was much more than it needed.  fish seemed fresh, but the rice was disappointing.  that ruined my dinner.\n\nwe decided to try their dessert since we don't usually order dessert at an asian restaurant.  we tried their miso almond cake which was the best part of my meal.  it came <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> caramel glaze and edamame <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark>.  the cake was yummier than i expected.  \n\noverall, it was not as good as i expected but i'm giving 3 stars for the good dessert and the great service.", 
            "very very good. hard to say that it lived up to the hype, but i thought the omakase was good value for $100. i went with my parents and they also ordered the omakase. the waiter tempted us with the $150 omakase containing \"dishes not on the menu\", but being our first time at nobu, we went with the cheaper omakase. the dishes (as best as i can remember from my pics), in order: (cold-hot-sushi-soup-dessert)\n\n1) toro with spicy miso and caviar - wow, definitely one of the highlights of the omakase. super juicy, melt-in-your-mouth toro topped with a bit of caviar and sitting in a nice spicy miso sauce. omg so good. there was an interesting tiny japanese peach on the side to cleanse the palate.\n\n2) hawaiian <mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> sashimi - very nice texture and mix of flavors with the a citrus sauce, spot of spicy sauce, a sprinkle of black sea salt, and . not sure if it's on the regular menu, maybe it's called something else.\n\n3) kampachi and <mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> sashimi - super exotic and tasty. i didn't even know what kampachi was until i looked it up. apparently it's hawaiian yellowtail farmed in the open ocean off the kona coast of the big island. the trout was also very good. it looks a bit like salmon, but tastes a lot better. served with a nice miso-based sauce (i think) on the side, a couple small veggie sushi rolls, a roasted jalapeno, and a small, yellow, pear-shaped tomato sliced in half.\n\n4) black cod w/ miso - this dish really did live up to the hype. i was about to order it separately in case it did not come with the omakase, but our waiter said it is normally included in the $100 omakase since it's a very popular dish. omg so good. such delicate flavors and texture. amazing. i normally don't like to eat fish skin, but this skin is super good and flavorful. the cod is very light and flaky, but not dry. wow, this is a must try if you come to nobu.\n\n5) beef tenderloin w/ shiitake mushroom <mark>Tuna (Big Eye) and Asparagus</mark> - i didn't think this was that special and probably would not order off the regular menu. it was very good tenderloin though, cooked to a perfect medium rare, with a light sauce. it is served in a sizzling mini cast iron plate.\n\n6) nigiri sushi platter - delicious nigiri, super fresh, and most pieces i normally wouldn't order myself, but were interesting to try. tuna (best i've had in awhile), <mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark>, aji, giant clam, and sweet shrimp. mmm\n\n7) <mark><mark>Lobster <mark>Miso Soup</mark></mark></mark> w/ clams - pretty standard <mark><mark>Lobster <mark>Miso Soup</mark></mark></mark> with a few clams inside. the clams and miso is a good combination, but they can be tricky to fish out and eat with only chopsticks. i cheated on one of them and used two fingers to hold the shell. ;p\n\n8) flourless chocolate cake w/ green tea <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark> - a generous portion served in a cute <mark>Bento Box</mark>. nothing too spectacular or interesting, but delicious nonetheless. the cake was still nice and molten inside when it arrived. yum!\n\na pretty filling flight of dishes for $100. i thought it was good value to try many dishes, but i haven't seen the sizes of the normal dishes. many tables around us also ordered the omakase, as i heard the same descriptions being recited by the staff over and over. i over heard a table of french tourists behind us ordering california rolls, chicken teriyaki, tempura, and other generic stuff you can get anywhere. sigh, what a waste.\n\ni would recommend not to order anything not on the \"hot\" of \"cold\" specialty pages of the menu. the rest is basically traditional japanese fare you can get anywhere, but will probably taste better and cost a lot more at nobu. service was good, polite, and attentive. it was a bit odd when our waiter brought out the first few dishes, and then a couple other different guys brought out some of the following ones. weird.\n\nthe decor is basic, but nothing too special. the sushi bar looks cool and there's a pretty wall of bamboo poles at the back as you walk in. my parents like to eat early, so we moved our reservation to 6pm when they are supposed to open. when we arrived a few minutes early, the door was locked and they didn't seem ready yet. ten minutes later, they were ready. better to come early though, or your omakase may take two hours or longer to get through. ours took about 90 minutes because it wasn't that crowded until after 7.\n\ni think the tenderloin and dessert could have been better and more creative. otherwise, nearly flawless.\n\nif i ever return for a special occasion, i will definitely need to try the $150 omakase. with the economy in shambles, i kinda feel bad eating such an expensive dinner. for<mark>Tuna (Big Eye)</mark>, my parents picked up the tab tonight as i had paid last night at the painted pony. maybe in 2009 they will have a recession special, like gray's papaya. ;p", 
            "the food was very good. the place was a bit loud as there were conventioners flooding the dinning area.\n\nthe miso cod was delicious. i also recomend the bento dessert box (green tea <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark> and chocolate lava cake anyone?!)", 
            "the <mark>Black Cod Miso</mark> cod got me. i loveeeeeee it. the ambiance was beautiful. i wish i came more hungry to try everything else. but omg their flourless chocolate molten cake with the green tea <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark> (<mark>Bento Box</mark>) topped the night. the best i've ever had. i wish i didnt have to share it with two other girls....hehe.\n\ni would def be back here in the near future.", 
            "i'm not going to lie--a small part of me dies every time i think about how much we spent here.  but the truth of the matter is, you can't get good sushi without paying for it.  \n\nwe ordered the $100 omakase, the uni tempura set, kabocha tempura, and salmon sashimi.\n\nthe fusion dishes (like the hamachi <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> or the snapper with cucumber <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Whole <mark>1/2 Maine Lobster</mark></mark> <mark>Roasted Poussin with Spicy Lemon</mark></mark> juice) were fun to try but i find that the sauces often overpower the fish, which is the best thing about nobu.  if you have never tried any of their signature dishes, you might want to order at least one of the omakase options, but if you're just looking to enjoy the fish qua fish, then order the sashimi and/or nigiri a la carte.\n\nand yes, let's talk about the fish.  i have never had such a wonderfully buttery miso black cod!  and the toro, maguro, aji, trout, and sake (as in salmon sashimi) simply melted in our mouths.  no biting necessary.  the only low point was that the anago in our complimentary sushi was littered with small fish bones but hey, it was complimentary!  yet another reason why i love nobu.  they know how to treat the ladies right.\n\nas for the tempura, the kabocha was out of season, so it was our bad for ordering it in the first place, but the uni tempura was unlike anything i have ever had.  every bite was bursting with succulence and the tempura batter <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> extra texture and flavor.  heavenly.  anyone who is a fan of uni and/or tempura needs to try this!  it also comes with tempura shiitake mushroom (luxuriously juicy), tempura shiso leaf (so crispy, so light), and one other <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark> that i forget but that my mom thought was delicious.\n\nthe dessert was lovely too--we had the <mark>Bento Box</mark> which consists of flourless chocolate cake and homemade green tea <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark>.  not too sweet and the perfect way to end a perfect meal.\n\ni seriously cannot wait to come back here again and try the <mark>Hamachi Kama</mark>, the snapper, the whole fried fish, and the squid salad.  is it expensive?  yes.  but is it worth it?  most definitely.", 
            "i love sushi, so obviously i am a fan of nobu's. the fish is always so fresh and delicious. my favorite is the yellowtail with the jalapenos.\n\nwe came here for a friend's birthday. the experience was good. the bad thing was the location of our table. there was a large table with a birthday right behind us, and they were all standing around like it was a night club for at least 45 minutes. my chair got bumped several times, until i was finally so irritated, i was ready to leave.\n\nthe <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark> things with the rice paper are amazing (sorry, forgot what they are called!). oh, and try the <mark><mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark></mark> - yum!\n\nthis place is very expensive, so be prepared for the sticker shock.", 
            "this is my second time here and both times i've come with my cousin. as much i love nobu, i only go there with her, since she loves it so much, but i never regret it. \n\nthe nice thing is i just let her order, since she knows what's good, but then if i ever go alone, i won't really know what to order. i did have a nice acai cocktail to start the night. it was delicious and refreshing, great way to start the meal. \n\nwe ordered the <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> which i loved since i love the spice. then we had the seafood spring rolls which weren't on the menu, but since they go there all the time, they knew about it. those were also really good, along with the <mark><mark>Nobu's Moriawase Sashimi Salad</mark></mark>. loved the dressing and there was so much sashimi! we also had the rock <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark>, which was kinda like popcorn shrimp, but really tasty <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> grilled beef thing. \n\nat the end, we ordered the <mark>Bento Box</mark>, which was a flourless chocolate cake with green tea <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark>. everything was really good, but service was a little slow. my other friends were also there and they were a party of 10. they started a little after us but finished before us!! other than that though, it was a great night.", 
            "it was saturday night in vegas, we wanted sushi, and nobu didnt even cross my mind until my boyfriend made reservations for the same night. i quickly logged on to yelp to check the latest reviews as i do with any restaurant, and i am happy to say that i am ecstatic i did this, because had i not, i would have missed out on the black cod <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark>.... which is without a doubt, one the best things that i have ever tasted. \n\nmy bf and i shared 4 dishes and 1 dessert, washed it down with 2 sapporo's each, and by the time we were done, we could barely walk!\n\n<mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark> - delicious!!!! the sauce may be just a bit overpowering but delicious nonetheless. i couldnt even taste the jalapeno :)\n\n<mark><mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark></mark> - i have no clue why they are calling this \"ceviche\" but i wish we would have ordered something else instead. it was merely ok,  it just kind of tasted like cold <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> lettuce - but hey, i love <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark>  its all good :)\n\nblack cod <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark> - omg - i just got goosebumps thinking about this dish. it is hands down the best thing i have ever put in my mouth. i like how crunchy <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> it is..  delicioso~\n\n<mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark> roll - your basic roll ..  \n\n<mark>Bento Box</mark> dessert ( flourless chocolate cake with green tea <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark>) yum yum yum yum - this is a great combination - not too much,  shared <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> special is a perfect way to satisfy your sweet tooth.\n\nwill definitely come back - loved the all male service - everyone was really nice and our waiter pretty much gave us his thoughts on all the menu items and gave us some nice suggestions - that in hindsight, i should have taken.\n\n but hey, theyre's always next time!!", 
            "yikes, what happened?\n\nconsistency isn't one of nobu's strengths, apparently, which i believe should be a priority if they are going to charge their customers as much as they do.  i ordered the cheaper $100 omakase again (which i do believe is a good deal given the amount of food you get) but the quality of fish has gone downhill since my last visit.\n\nthe signature hamachi <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark>?  devoid of all velvety tenderness.  the salmon sashimi?  like chewing a rug.  the maguro nigiri?  stringy and tough.\n\non top of it all, i ventured out and tried the <mark>Hamachi Kama</mark>.  not bad, but terrible for $20.  in san diego, you can get the same size <mark>Hamachi Kama</mark> with every bite just as, if not more, succulent for $9.  there is no excuse, honestly.  if you are going to charge me $20, you better make sure not a single sliver of white meat is dry.  half the fish was, but luckily there was dipping sauce to keep the meat from being unbearable to the palate.\n\nnobu isn't a complete loss, though.  like i stated before, the omakase is a great deal, price wise.  it comes with the famed bento dessert, which was even better than i remembered it being last time.  we also tried the miso almond cake and edamame <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark>, which was great in that it was unique and creative (the taste, quite honestly, was *salty*), but it all paled in comparison with the flourless chocolate cake crowned in green tea <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark> that is the bento.  never be tempted to order a different dessert here at nobu.  ever.\n\nsame goes with the black cod.  yes, it's small and yes, it's expensive if you order it a la carte, but it's worth every luscious bite.  it should be a must-order if you come here (it comes with the omakase, but it's so good, you should probably just order another).\n\none item not part of the omakase menu is the uni tempura set.  perhaps the deep frying hides any flaws in the uni, but i could taste that warm sweet flavor that i know is associated with high quality freshness.  gotta love the juicy mushroom and refreshing shiso that comes with it too.  the set is also accompanied with a set of delightful salts, all used to enhance in my opinion, what needs no enhancement.  still nice to look at, though, and they make for some good pictures!\n\ni also tried one of the eponymous sakes and was impressed.  can't remember which one, but the price was reasonable.  wonderfully smooth and paired well with the fish.  i highly recommend that you get it served hot.\n\nwhile i maintain an a-ok for nobu, i doubt i'll be coming back.  there are other places to get better japanese food--and for better prices.", 
            "the visit was on a labor day sunday around 6pm.  the last visit to this particular nobu was back in 2003 when i didn't know the difference between a piece of foie and a rubber sole.  i recall having the chef special back then as well, but the omakase this time was definitely more enjoyable.  this was probably due to the fact that i wasn't three sheets to the wind this time.  being married does these things.\n\nthere were those that chose the bronze omakase ($100) and those that went for the silver ($150) like yours truly, and boy was there ever a difference.  there were major discrepancies between the cuts and also the types of meats served.  the sashimi and the speciality dishes also had noticeable differences.  it's not to say that the 100 dollar omakase wasn't good, but it wasn't great...at least from my vantage point.\n\nthere's about a zillion details i will be leaving out, such as the dried flakes of hoo-haa sprinkled with a drizzle of the thinger thang.  so use your imagination..\n\ncourse 1 - a bonito sashimi.\ncourse 2 - amaebi splashed with hot oil, chawan mushi with truffle and crab eggs at the bottom, kampachi sashimi with dried miso flakes.\ncourse 3 - toro sashimi <mark>King Crab with Amazu Ponzu</mark> ginger sauce <mark>Yellowtail and Jalapeno</mark> sauce topped with a bunch of edible flowers which made it all purdy and crap.\ncourse 4 - seared <mark>Scallop</mark> on a bed of sea beans.\ncourse 5 - kobe beef (served medium) with pan fried <mark>Teppan Style Foie Gras</mark>.\ncourse 6 - sushi set (nigiri) <mark>Inaniwa Pasta with Lobster</mark> broth and <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark>.  the set consisted of - toro, abalone, spanish mackerel, eel, tai (<mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark>) and tamago.\ncourse 7 - an array of sweets including <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark>, chocolate looking souffle thing, fresh fruits and other sugary confections we couldn't stay for because we were already late for the friggin cirque du pouffay show.\n\n..\n\nall in all, a great meal.  i enjoyed the silver omakase at matsuhisa better, the wife liked this dinner much better.  definitely a strong 4 star, but nowhere near a five.  the highlight of the meal for me was the foie served over the kobe.  the dish was so luxurious i really was at a loss for words as i was enjoying every delectable bite.  the slice of black truffle in the chawan mushi gives you a big mule kick in the face which was in short, heavenly.  \n\ni was surprised to find that i liked the non sushi dishes better than the raw, but is it such a huge surprise?  we live in cities like la, sf, ny, etc. where quality ingredients are so readily available.  i've had sashimi as good if not better in other restaurants.  most don't serve it with the detail and ingenuity like mr. nobu matsuhisa, but it takes way too much money to surprise this sushi cowboy.\n\ni truly don't mean to sound snobbish, but there's only so many ways to serve up a nice slab of toro.  i'm more impressed these days by the way chefs serve up foie.  and i am totally infatuated with bone marrow.\n\n..\n\ni've said too much.  \n\ni am off to eat.\n\nedit:\n\ni don't know if it was because we were in vegas, but i felt like everything was a bit contrived.\n\n*shrugs*", 
            "after being seated, our table was presented a single drink menu, and left alone for fifteen minutes. our waiter seemed a little miffed when he asked what we were going to start with to drink and i told him that we'd like to see food menus. i found it presumptuous and manipulative to leave us with a drink menu and that much free time. we are in vegas, i know, but when you're willing to pay for a nice meal, i expect a little more tact on behalf of the servers.\n\nour waiter was also very quick to tell us how he thought we should move through the menu, all the while, mispronouncing common japanese dishes.\n\nwe tried a number of different dishes and rolls from the blue fin toro to <mark>Spicy Miso Chips <mark>Nobu Crispy Rice with Big Eye Tuna</mark> or <mark>Scallop</mark></mark>, <mark>Fresh Water Eel</mark>, albacore, and <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark>. everything was... good. not impressive, certainly not memorable... just good.\n\nthe interior of this location was bland. one of my co-workers mentioned that the decoration on the walls looked like large ironing boards, which was a fair assessment. the main dining area was too bright for a comfortable dinner, and had us sitting around the kind of small, wood topped table you might find yourself at while having lunch at your favorite sandwich shop.\n\nthe banana cake <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> cream <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark> was a high note, although the spoonful <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark> that they tried to pass off as a scoop made me feel like i was caught in a scene from american psycho. \n\nfor all the noise i heard about nobu being something special, i left feeling uninspired, and with a reminder to myself why finding those one of a kind, family run japanese restaurants is such a treat.", 
            "if it were only about the sushi, nobu would get 5 stars from me. but, i knock off 2 stars for service. we walked in on a saturday night and got seats at the sushi bar, which is the place to be. we went with our sushi chef's suggestions, which were nobu's <mark>House Special</mark>, including \"new-style sashimi.\" these consist of the best fish, <mark>White Fish <mark>Scallop <mark>Salmon <mark>Oyster <mark>Beef <mark>Yuba Sashimi New Style</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark>, with delicate sauces and garnishes: <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark>, live octopus with a peruvian chili paste, whitefish and salmon <mark>King Crab with Amazu Ponzu</mark> sauce, tuna <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark>-mustard sauce. everything was first-class, including the junmai daiginjo sake.\n\nthen, i ordered the <mark>Bento Box</mark> chocolate cake dessert. we were told it would take 8 minutes to cook. no problem - our bellies were happily full of sashimi. 20 minutes later, however, still no dessert, and we finally were able to flag someone down to check on it. another ten minutes went by. our waiter then came out to tell us there was a mixup in the kitchen and our cake went to another table. he tried to give us a plateful <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark> to tide us over - this didn't go over well, as the last thing we wanted was to eat a plateful <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark> and then a chocolate cake. another ten minutes or so, the dessert came out. it was excellent, but frankly wasn't worth waiting over half an hour for. we ask ed for the check while still eating...took another ten minutes...gave the credit card and another ten minutes went by...waiter came out to tell us the credit card isn't clearing and do we want to give another card? by this point, well over an hour had gone by since dessert was ordered and we just wanted to leave already. \n\nwhen our check finally arrived, they did charge us for the dessert that took over 30 minutes to arrive at our table. when i mentioned this to the server, he took it right off the bill. but i was miffed that i even had to ask - the right thing to do would have been to take it off in the first place.\n\ntoo bad, since up until we ordered dessert we were very pleased with the sushi our wonderful chef served us. even for a saturday night in vegas, the service was unacceptably unresponsive for such a high-end restaurant.", 
            "i adore nobu! i go there every time i'm in vegas!\n\nit is pricey, i spent $300 for dinner for two this past trip.....but it is sooooo worth it. \n\nmy picks: \n-hamachi w/ jalapenos\n-\"live\" octopus\n-tiradito \"live\" scallop\n-black cod <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark>\n-kobe beef (try tataki style)\n-<mark>Bento Box</mark> (chocolate cake with green tea <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark>)\n\nthough honestly, i've never had anything bad there. and try the nobu brand beer (made exclusively for them), i'm not a big beer drinker but it pairs really, really well with the food. \n\nthe waiters are always excellent. they know the entire menu, so feel free to ask them for recommendations. \n\nif you have to pick one nice, expensive dinner in vegas.....definitely pick nobu.", 
            "the food here was amazing! we've heard about nobu from a friend of ours and decided to have our valentines dinner here. our waiter suggested 4-5 dishes for the both of us. so, we ordered the monk fish liver <mark>Yellowtail or Salmon <mark>Blue Fin <mark>Toro Tartare</mark> with Royal Ossetra Caviar</mark></mark>, tuna sashimi, salmon tartar, black cod <mark><mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> <mark>Spinach Salad with Dry Miso</mark></mark>, uni and an order of the <mark>Soft Shell Crab</mark> roll for the fiance who doesn't enjoy much raw dishes. the food and not to mention the presentation was incredible. we enjoyed each and every dish. for dessert, we picked the <mark>Bento Box</mark> which includes warm valrhona chocolate souffle cake, shiso syrup, white chocolate sauce and green tea <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark> mmmmmmmmmmmmm. i'm so ready to go back and try more dishes on their menu.", 
            "before the concert started at the hard rock, i had enough time to sit down and have a fabulous dinner. at first i thought that steak might be a good idea, but i love asian food and wanted a great experience. my boyfriend and i walked into nobu, a japanese restaurant. for our first time there, we decided to ask for assistance with the menu, and chose several things from each part.\n\ntheir menu is broken up by sushi, cold, hot and specialties. we decided to go with a little bit of everything.\n\nour favorite was the <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark>, and the crab tempura with their special sauce. their tempura shrimp and <mark>Vegetable</mark> were great also.\n\noverall, for the price of 266 dollars for two people to eat out of a tasting menu, it was a great experience. i can't say much about their food because i have to say that i've eaten better tempura at our local asian restaurant, well being in the box.\n\nalthough their tempura was okay (it was too soft and not crispy at all), their sushi was as close to the guam experience as we could get. it was sweet, done perfect, and the sauces were impeccable.\n\ni honestly didn't feel that their tempura was worth the 200 dollar ticket. that was majority of our bill. i do believe that their signature <mark>Bento Box</mark> dessert was worth 14 dollars. it was creamy, a perfect souffle, and their green tea <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark> was just like home.\n\nif you want something other than tempura for your experience at nobu, it's worth the price tag and the trip. for myself, a good japanese restaurant serves light, crispy, and fluffy tempura the way i've had it in japan and on guam from top japanese chefs. however, this was not the case, unfor<mark>Tuna (Big Eye)</mark>.\n\ni give this restaurant my personal 3/5 stars.", 
            "another wonderful iteration of nobu. having had this before at their honolulu location i had high expectations for this vegas experience. and i was not let down. although nobu is famous for their sushi i actually forwent having any and instead went for their superior and more unique hot and cold dishes. one constant stand out that i have had before is their blackened cod in butter lettuce cups. the varying textures and tastes are a perfect pairing. if you go you must ask for this as it is not on their menu. i also had the tempura fried rock shrimp in the creamy spicy sauce and again it was perfect, yummy, wow. \n\nfor dessert we had the <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark>. and as you can read in my review of bubbies in honolulu it probably would've been just as good or better to have gone to whole foods afterwards and picked some up. still is was very good but not bubbies.\n\nmy only criticism is that this high style establishment is located in the hard rock. kinda feels a little out of place but either way anytime i'm back in vegas i will undoubtably be back.", 
            "amazing black cod. amazing. so, so good. the <mark>White Fish <mark>Scallop <mark>Salmon <mark>Oyster <mark>Beef <mark>Yuba Sashimi New Style</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark> tataki is my second favorite. if you're considering yellowtail, do the sashimi even of you're tired of ponzu and jalape\\u00f1o. the yellowtail roll isn't as good. i mean, it's great, but i think the sashimi plate is a better deal with more flavor. like blair b. said, get the unique plates here.\n\nas a side note, nobu participated in the taste of the nation, las vegas, which is a fundraiser to end childhood hunger in nevada. nobu cares about our community. i really appreciate that!\n\nservice at nobu is really out of this world.\n\nnobu's <mark>Bento Box</mark> is my favorite dessert of all time, so much so that i replicate it at home with success--flour-less chocolate cake with green tea <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark> and hot fudge. lord have mercy i am in heaven!\n\nif you have the money, spend it on nobu.",

            "my buddy and i went to nobu this past friday night at 9:30 for their omasake chef choice tasting menu. we had very few disappointments. they sat us right away at the bar, tables would have been 15 minutes even with our reservations.  lots of good energy in the restaurant, lots of japanese yelling back and forth from the waiters and sushi chefs.  we split a $50 bottle of nonfiltered very fragrant nigori sake cold which was smooth and easy to drink. the small bits of rice at the bottle of the bottle reminded me of red wine sediment as a good thing. \n\nthe first course came out quick and cold. a chilled patty of toro tartar in a soy wasabi sauce topped <mark>Yellowtail or Salmon <mark>Blue Fin <mark>Toro Tartare</mark> with Royal Ossetra Caviar</mark></mark>, served with a baby silver spoon.  it was tender, smooth, rich and melt in your mouth.  the caviar was not memorable.  an a+ start and an expensive dish on their regular menu. next was 4 pieces per plate of thin cut fresh octopus topped with a cilantro leaf, a dot of super hot sauce, finished with citrus, like ceviche.  pretty good.  next was another cold appetizer of rice paper wrapped greens with a piece of raw ebi sweet shrimp, dressed with a fantastic sesame ginger sauce with a fried prawn head on the side.  my buddy especially liked the tempura batter on the <mark>Sweet Shrimp with Fried Head</mark> and the dressing.  i will personally come to your house and kill you if you do not eat the fried prawn head. \n\nthen started the hot plates.  first was the ever famous <mark>Black Cod Miso</mark> cod, a bit too sweet for my buddy but it did not keep us from both licking the plates.  a small piece of tender fish which just went on and on and kept melting in our mouths.  flavor of fish hard to come through past miso and sweetness.  like fish candy in a good way.  my friend said that an improvement would be to torch and crisp up the skin before putting on the sauce which would give some texture contrast and make the dish over the top.  $23 on the regular menu.  next was the beef tenderloin toban yaki style with a shitake and enokitake mushrooms and a piece of thin asparagus in a soy broth. beef very lean, not as melt in your mouth as i would like.  my buddy would have liked a nice piece of ribeye cap instead but who wouldn't.  the dish is served spitting hot on a mini hot plate and when they raise the cover in front of you, the steam envelopes you warmly.  try not to get the grease on you. \n\nnext was the nigiri sushi course of 5 pieces along with a nice clam <mark><mark>Lobster <mark>Miso Soup</mark></mark></mark>. we got a piece of <mark>Japanese Red Snapper</mark> (mmmm), magura tuna (so tender), yellowtail (yum), clam (a bit tough) and <mark>Sea Eel</mark> which was the most tender fall apart <mark>Sea Eel</mark> i have ever tasted.  the sushi rice <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> fill you to the gills by that point and then they hit you with the dessert which was a bento presentation of a warm flowerless chocolate lava cake with lots of lava and very little cake and a very good not sweet green tea <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark>.   this just put the nail in the coffin.  we were stuffed, but we couldn't stop eating since it was so good.  \n\nthe restaurant closed at 11pm on a friday night, but we will remember the meal for a long time coming.  next time i'm in vegas i plan to make it a point to return and see what the chef choice is at that point in time.  this was the $100 omasake.  the $150 would have <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> some kobe beef and <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> and there.  we were very happy with our choice.  i think the meal was an absolute bargain for the price.",

            "this is, quite simply, the best food that i have ever eaten. i come here every two years for a packaging convention and i try to make nobu a treat for my key employees. it is expensive, to be sure, but the food is so worth it. \n\nthis is not a \"slap on the feed bag joint\".  it is meant to be enjoyed over a couple of hours.  the plates are small but are meant to be shared with friends. you should order a few plates so that each bite is savored and you get to try multiple kinds of food. hot and cold dishes with a japanese/peruvian flair. \n\ncold sake in a bamboo pitcher and shot glasses. \n\nwe had a few cold dishes...salmon, oysters, edamame, and a couple more.\n\nhot dishes of <mark>Black Cod Miso</mark> cod, sea bass, <mark>Scallop</mark>.....\n\n<mark>Bento Box</mark> flowerless chocolate cake, green tea <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark>, a peach dish and an apple donut plate that was beyond belief. \n\ngreat ambiance, service and food. a delicious treat.", 
            "nobu is like a foodie dream come true. first off, the ambiance was lovely---the noise level was definitely on the high side but i didn't mind. we had a group of 5 people so we ordered several small plates. we started off with two cold dishes: oysters and <mark>Yellowtail Belly</mark> special. hot dishes: <mark>Shrimp or <mark>Scallop</mark> with Wasabi Pepper or Spicy Garlic</mark> and kobe beef gyoza. and different varieties of sushi afterwards. you really can't go wrong with any of these. the <mark>Dessert</mark> were truly a revelation and the perfect way to end the meal: yuzu panna cotta with raspberry mango caviar and raspberry sorbet; flourless chocolate molten cake with green tea <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark>; and the miso brioche/apple donuts with caramel sauce. i won't bother using any adjectives like \"delicious\" or \"amazing\" because i think the descriptions speak for themselves. end of story.", 
            "went there in the summer to celebrate boyfriend's birthday. of course, we had the omakase... \n\nkey points:\n- the exotic fish sashimi and tartar were very very good, because they were usually combined <mark>Yellowtail or Salmon <mark>Blue Fin <mark>Toro Tartare</mark> with Royal Ossetra Caviar</mark></mark>. fresh too... duh... \n- black cod. signature!!! yummy!!! although to be honest, i think it could be a little too sweet for certain individuals. \n- yellow tail w/ jalape\\u00f1os. interesting testing. def something new for me!\n- kobe beef... whatever. \n- sushi. really??? ok... don't ever go to nobu for the sushi. it's not even real japanese rice or freshly made wasabi!!!! \n- best best best warm chocolate lava green tea <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark> cake ever!!!!\n\nbtw, the bill was around $350. no complains whatsoever.\n\nconclusion: must go before you die. or before your taste buds die.", 
            "holy crap, the food here was so good!  we had all different kinds of dishes - sashimi, hot dishes, various lettuce wraps, etc., and everything was so tasty.  they even made us some dishes that weren't on the menu that my friend requested from the matsuhisa menu.  \n\nthe service was also great - they explained all the dishes as they came out and kept our water glasses full.  \n\nthe one thing i was not a fan of was the flavored fruity sakes.  they tasted like fruit roll ups or jam, and they were just not very pleasant.  i did however enjoy my peruvian caipirinha, and would recommend that.  also enjoyed a couple sips of my friend's johnny blue, but when is that not the case?  \n\nhad <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark> for dessert, and they had some awesome flavors you can't find elsewhere like red velvet.  \n\nit's weird that my first nobu experience was in vegas, given that i live in la, but now i'm excited to check out the nobus near home!  :)", 
            "simply amazing best ever!!!   i struggled to give it 5 stars, i think i would call this a 4.5 star rating.   its a little overpriced for what it is, they need to do more food, i left hungry.  that shouldnt happen.  service 98 out of 100.  food 95 out of 100  value 80 out of 100.   i think it was a little overpriced, but the quality was totally there!   i would definitely go again, and i think i would love it again, but it let me down just a little, after hearing all the hype.   i could go here once , or go to sushi mon 4 times, all i can eat, you know my choice on that one if i want sushi 4 times!   \n\nafter the sticker shock, which i didnt pay so i dont care what it costs, the food was insanely good.  we had the saki, beers, and a feast of sashimi, shrimp, <mark><mark>Lobster <mark>Miso Soup</mark></mark></mark>, and rolls.   my favorite was the lettuce wrapped black cod, oh my god, this was the best fish bite i have ever had.  it melted in your mouth like butter from the fat and the protein - i am not sure if it was oil pan fried, or what, it was hot, but not too hot, but it had a little sizzle on it, and the glazed oil on it just <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> to the silky flavor.  i would go back there just for that!   the desert was a rhubarb molten love with <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark> over it, talk about yummy!   tasted like strawberries to me, but it was perfect, i would have taken one more scoop <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark>, next time i will ask.   i am sure they would accommodate.     5 star food at 5 star prices.    \n\ndecor was a little drab to me, i dont know what it was, it was classy, but too dark, the bamboo was nice, but i think they could use some live fish tank in the place, maybe i missed something, the walkway in was nice, but the dining room was a little drab for me.  i think a splash of color would have been nice.   anyway, i am nitpicking now and thats not fair to them.    quality stuff, incredible food, great dining room, great location at hard rock.  highly recommended.  please bring your wallet, or someone elses, you will need it!     also, be prepared for a late night snack later meal after, unless you are on a diet.    4.5 star overall, i likey!", 
            "i must admit, i have not been to a nobu that i didn't like.  so yes, i am a fan of this high-end japanese chain restaurant.  we had dinner here this past friday night.  unfor<mark>Tuna (Big Eye)</mark> i am not fond of the hotel that it's located in... which is barely a step up from a hooters-type ambiance with the class-less tatted out clientele and their hoochie mama's attached to their hips.  well back in the day hard rock was the place to go to... but that was years ago.  so the fact that one has to step foot into the hard rock casino to get into the entrance of this restaurant... should really get a minus star for not strategically relocating this at a more ritzy hotel casino like bellagio or cosmopolitan.   \n\nwe started off with cocktails... lychee martini and a greyhound... can't go wrong there.  as for the app...started off with the sea salted warm edemame.  i was so hungry, i practically ate all the soy beans.  i ordered the yummy <mark>Kelp Salad</mark> and he ordered hamachi sashimi with jalepeno... so perfectly fresh <mark>King Crab with Amazu Ponzu</mark> sauce or miso... so good!  he ordered the <mark>Shrimp or <mark>Scallop</mark> with Wasabi Pepper or Spicy Garlic</mark> was sinfully delicious... (fried so not a healthy choice).  and i ordered the chilean sea bass with dried miso... my all time favorite, which did not disappoint!  salmon, hamachi and unagi sushi... small but still so good.  and we ended with yet another cocktail :-) and the <mark>Bento Box</mark>.... flourless chocholate cake with white chocolate sauce and green tea <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark>... omg!  amazing dinner with outstanding service.  yes nobu is expensive but i was for<mark>Tuna (Big Eye)</mark> that he was so generous... so not really sure what our bill was... but so worth every bite.",

            "this is a review of the groupon deal dinner.\n\nthe skinny: fusion peruvian japanese dishes left me unimpressed (3) service: excellent service despite the disappointing cuisine (5) value: for the groupon, it is still overpriced for what it is. so you can imagine what i have to say about full price ... not worth it (2.5).\n\nso here's the deal. we spotted the nobu groupon for $95/2 person (regularly $150) prix fixe menu and we thought \"how can we pass this up?\".\n\nwe went and were seated prompty. our server was great at giving us time and space to make some decisions on the menu. we ended up getting in <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> to the prix fixe an order of their <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark> to round out the menu. the specials that they offered didn't really appeal - there was a lot of fruit/candied nuts mixed in with sashimi which sounded overly sweet to me so i passed on those.\n\nstarting <mark><mark>Tasmanian Ocean Trout</mark> with Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu Soy</mark> simple edamame with maldon sea salt (love those flakes!), it was a nice way to start a meal.\n\ncourse 1) <mark>Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno</mark>/cilantro (6 slices): this was a good dish but not exceptional. although i have had different versions of this before, this is one of the better renditions given the quality of the fish and the strategically correct amount of heat. my only thing with this dish was the actual slices of sashimi itself - the slices were a bit thin and ragged along the edges which surprised me given the supposed caliber of this place.\n\ncourse 2) selection of nigri (6 pcs) and a california roll (6 pcs): the nigri was okay - the slices of fish were decent sized. i was despondent when i realized that the sushi rice was a little too overcooked and sticky.\n\ncourse 3) rock <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark>: the first bite was good however as we ate, the spicy aioli began to slowly permeate the batter leading to a soggier batter. i think it aioli would have been better served as a dipping sauce rather than dressed on the tempura to retain textural integrity. flavorwise, this was a nice dish and we loved the mixture of chive and togarashi.\n\ncourse 4) miso glazed black cod: candied black cod more like it! overly sweet, the piece of fish was smothered in the sugary sauce which became more unappetizing the more we worked to finish this. i have made this at home using his recipe with 1/2 the sugar and it is much better.\n\ncourse 5) <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark> (<mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> to the groupon): the tempura was okay nothing special. the batter was slightly spongier than what i like. i think it would have been better if the shredded daikon/ginger was provided to us so we could <mark>Add Lobster 1/2</mark> much/little we wanted.\n\ncourse 6) normally this would be <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark> except it was my birthday so i got a molten cake with a tiramisu and green tea <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark>. all of them were very good however there was nothing that really wow'ed me to think that it was exceptional.\n\nperhaps 10 years ago, the level of this fusion cuisine would be considered cutting edge. however time has made his dishes appear quite dated. the signature dishes of rock <mark>Shrimp and <mark>Shojin Vegetable Tempura</mark></mark>/yellowtail jalape\\u00f1o sashimi/miso glazed black cod are easily found elsewhere - one might argue that this location's rendition is rather lackluster considering the price. given the many issues with the dishes mentioned above, i cannot recommend this place given the groupon price let alone full price. although our server was truly exceptional, that doesn't make up for the food. 2.5 rounded up to 3 starred review.",

            "my boyfriend had just been telling me that we should try eating at nobu, so when i saw a groupon for this place the next day we couldn't pass it up.\n\nwe bought the $95 groupon ($150 value) which included a five-course tasting menu for two. my favorite was the first dish, their signature yellowtail sashimi with jalape\\u00f1o. i do agree with other reviewers who said the sashimi was a bit thin, but wow did it taste great. the dessert dish was a close second favorite. it included a molten chocolate cake, green tea <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark>, and a whiskey-infused cappuccino-like dessert. my least favorite was the assorted sushi dish that included a california roll and six pieces of nigiri (tuna, salmon, and snapper). every other dish was unique and full of flavor, while this assorted sushi dish was average at best.\n\naside from the five-course meal, we also ordered their popular cucumber martini. it was a strong little drink with a fantastically fresh aroma. i don't often love the scent of alcohol but this drink was a definite exception.\n\nwe had a very satisfying experience overall. although slow at times, the service was great and every dish was thoroughly explained. the manager was also quite nice and stopped to speak with us for a moment.\n\nwe weren't entirely stuffed by the end of our five courses, but we were full enough. overall, the food-tasting was a true experience and definitely worth a try, but this isn't a place i would frequent due to their notably high prices. to sum up my review - if you're into high quality japanese tapas-like dishes and can easily afford the heady price point, this place is for you!", 
            "i would give this place a million stars, but it only goes up to 5.  my husband and i were staying at the hard rock hotel & casino on our honeymoon, and received a gift card to nobu, at our request, from my sister-in-law.  i've heard nothing but good things, and they were all true.  we chose the omakase menu option.  we had 9 courses each, and the dessert came with three different items, for each of us.  we spent just under $400 after the tip for both of us, and it was worth every penny.  the service and food was absolutely impeccable.  our server was amazing.  the manager came out to our table personally and presented us with the gift card my sister-in-law had purchased prior, over the phone.  he also provided us with complimentary glasses of champagne.  i am terrible at naming cuisine that i don't normally eat, so can't remember specifically all items we had, but for certain, the yellowtail tartare w/ caviar, the <mark>Mushroom Soup</mark>, the black cod w/ miso, the wagyu beef and the chocolate molten cake, green tea <mark>Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream</mark> and cappucino <mark>Dessert</mark> were so delicious.  i have not one bad thing to say about the food or service at this place.  nobu at the hard rock is a gem in the middle of a loud and crazy city.  this meal was the highlight of our dining experience on our week-long honeymoon in vegas.  i would eat here every single day if i could.",
