            "i must say, i was pleasantly surprised by how great everything was; the service, portions, price (made sense), taste. \nwe ordered the asian <mark><mark>Chinese Chicken Salad</mark></mark> (has a dif name but i cant think of it at <mark>Spago Cold Pressed Juice of the Moment</mark>), the meatloaf, and 2 desserts. \nall portions were big enough to split among 2 or maybe even 3, depending on your appetite. \nthe salad didn't have too much dressing and had this crunch that i always enjoy in a salad so that was a great start. \nas for the meatloaf, i normally don't even consider eating meatloaf (for personal reasons) but my aunt recommended it and i can see why. very well balanced and probably one of the best i've had (but then again i haven't had much so...)\nas for dessert, we ordered key lime, light yet satisfying. \n\ndefinitely recommend!\n\nps. this review is extremely late as i just noticed i never clicked \"submit\"", 
            "located inside the shops at the forum/caesar's palace, a beautiful place to shop, window shop, or just walk around for the ambience.  spago las vegas is a lot more fun and less \"stuffy\" than spago beverly hills.  helpful, friendly, attentive staff from <mark>Spago Cold Pressed Juice of the Moment</mark> you walk in the doors.  great wine selection.  beautiful culinary presentation.  delicious food."

            "i am a fan of all of wolfgang's restaurants in vegas. what i have found is that the quality of the preparation and ingredients is consistent across the board. so whether it postrio, the mgm bar and grill, or spago, its never going to disappoint. \n\nwhen talking about spago itself, there are several things i enjoy, the decoration and the music suit my tastes very well and make for a nice si down dinner. the bar is solid, i love being able to walk in without a reservation, sit down, and order a great pizza or dish of mussels for a very fair price.  great people watching too, vegas brings in every type of person from every type of country, and that's as good a show as anything i have paid to see!.\n\ngo to spago when you want to try something new. i have read reviews here of people being dissappointed about pasta dishes and other common every day fare. my memorable dishes have been tuna tartar in a crispy want<mark><mark>Three Oysters on the Half Shell</mark></mark>, lobster salad served on an asian soup spoon, pan fried sardine over a citrus vinaigrette slaw ( which was mind blowing!) some awesome mains i have had have been duck breast with cauliflower puree and root veg, where the fat was rendered off and made the meat ridiculously delicious and the skin crispy and perfect.  \n\ni write this on my latest trip to vegas and eagerly anticipate my new visit on thursday night!", 
            "had lunch here with the boyfriend. \n\nhe had the prosciutto wrapped meatloaf, which he loved.  i'm not a fan of meatloaf in general, but i tried a bit.  it was good.  if i were a meatloaf-lover, i would have loved it, too.\n\ni had the prix fixe menu: prosciutto/melon salad (amazing), spicy shrimp/tomato risotto, cherry pie.  the salad was absolutely delicious.  i love prosciutto and melon, so it wasn't a surprise that i loved the salad, but it was nice to have high quality ingredients.  the risotto was good, but not outstanding.  it was well-made, not mushy, and had a small kick.  a couple shrimp were slightly overcooked, though.\n\nthe cherry pie was good, but not excellent.  <mark><mark>Three Oysters on the Half Shell</mark></mark> was a little dry, and so were the cherries.  not enough of that juicy, cherry goodness.\n\ni almost forgot, when the bread guy comes around, make sure you get the cherry-walnut bread.  i could eat a whole loaf if given the chance.", 
            "delicious!\n\ni went here this past weekend while i was in vegas with my boyfriend and his friends. we were worried we were dressed too casual, but it doesn't seem to be that big of a deal. also, we went in around 8-9ish and we were seated without having to wait.\n\nthe bread basket they give you is so good! they give you raisin bread, a cheesy/onion bread, and parmesan cracker crisps. the parmesan cracker crisps were divine - i could eat a million of them, really.\n\nfor appetizers, my boyfriend ordered their crab cakes. yum! lots of sweet crab meat, slightly crispy on the edges, and a beautiful presentation with fresh flowers. another friend ordered their <mark><mark>Three Oysters on the Half Shell</mark></mark>, which i didn't try because i'm not that big of a fan of oysters, but everyone who tried it said they were super fresh and delicious.\n\ni ended up ordering their pan seared duck breast since one of my boyfriend's friends recommended it. it was really good! i loved the sweet sauce they put around the duck and the slightly crispy texture was great, as well. the duck was very moist and pretty much melts in your mouth. definitely recommend it!\n\ni tried my boyfriend's kobe ribeye. so good! it's the most expensive entree on the menu, but well worth it because the quality and quantity is incredible. so juicy, lots of flavor, and the pomme aligot, which is like cheese melted into mashed potatoes, was amazing with the meat! although i'd probably regret it later, i could eat that pomme aligot with a spoon. a tip for the kobe ribeye is that they cook it differently than other restaurants. my boyfriend ordered it medium well, but it actually looked more like medium rare. another friend at the table who ordered the same thing asked for it medium rare and it was pretty bloody.\n\nservice is very attentive, as well, which i would expect from such a nice restaurant. overall, good experience there, but it's definitely not an every day type of eating place. we'll probably only be going back if we win in blackjack again, lol.", 
            "after picking up tickets at will-call for absinthe, we figured \"hmmmm, now where to eat?\"\nwe were stranded on the expansive grounds at caesar's palace and figured the wisest choice was to check out the restaurants inside the hotel. \n\nthat being said, we headed straight for the forum shops!\na quick stroll lead us to wolfgang puck's world famous spago!\n\nhaving dined previously at the iconic beverly hills location, i came with an expectation of good quality food and great service. \n\nwe were running late so we wanted a quick but tasty meal. with the attractive al fresco dining option albeit indoors with artificial skyline and people watching galore, we opted for cafe seating. within moments, we were seated and began perusing the menu. \n\nfor appetizers, we enjoyed the oysters on a <mark><mark>Three Oysters on the Half Shell</mark></mark>. let me tell ya, these lil' guys were fresh, plump and with the addictively tangy cocktail sauce, it was a virtual party in my mouth! foodgasm guaranteed!\n\nnow onto the entrees:\n\nspaghettini with a side of roasted chicken - i've been on a scratch made pasta kick lately, so when i had heard they rolled out fresh pasta daily, i was instantly sold!  there's a difference in the texture, flavor and overall mouthfeel of the pasta! if you haven't had it fresh i strongly advise you try a plate of the spaghettini here. it's phenomenal! each strand was coursing with a vibrant red sauce which lent its wonderful aroma from the fresh basil. the richness of the sauce and marked acidity came from the ropa vieja tomatoes, which rounded out the flavor profiles of this winning dish perfectly.\nand the chicken? tender and juicy with an irresistibly crispy skin that i devoured in a flash!\n\nlamb chorizo pizza with rapini, sundries tomatoes, goat cheese and cilantro -  now this was my kinda pizza pie! it was nice and thin but definitely not lacking in the flavor department by any means. the lamb chorizo was savory and well seasoned and the crunchy rapini added a pleasant  contrast in texture. the chopped cilantro and fresh tomato brightened up the dish and definitely took this droolworthy pizza to another level of deliciousness! \n\nservice was prompt and friendly. our waters were always filled and staff constantly stopped by to see how we were doing, which was nice for a bustling cafe. we enjoyed an elegant meal that was quick, unfussy and delicious!\n\noverall, i was quite pleased with my experience here and it goes without saying i'd  definitely come back.  hopefully with time to spare on my next visit, ill give the main dining room a whirl.\n\nuntil then,\n\nhappy eats!", 
            "what really hasn't been said about spago both good and bad.  i can add a few tidbits that might help a brother out but that's about it.\n\nextremely amazing service.  everybody was very attentive and accommodating.  we brought our little boy here because we were invited by a good friend and some of his coworkers since we were all at the same conference that weekend. very thoughtful of them.  anyway, the staff was extra attentive to our son and really took the time to attend to his needs even though it was really hopping that night.  \n\nfor example, when he was a little fussy and i had to take him outside to walk around a bit, they gladly kept my food under a warmer for the few minutes that i was outside.  \n\nthe food was amazing as expected.  i will reel off a quick list of what we had.\n\niced <mark><mark>Three Oysters on the Half Shell</mark></mark>  with ginger-rhubarb mignonette - fresh and tasty like the sea.   i believe they were kumamoto oysters.\n\nwild pacific blue shrimp - no preservatives here.  fresh fresh fresh.\n\nsymphony of tuna - can't explain all the ways but yum, yum, yum.  \n\nchilled maryland blue crab salad - a spoonful of goodness. a bit of avocado, grapefruit segments and a lemon vinaigrette along with the crab served in a ramen type soup spoon.  wow.\n\ngrilled french <mark><mark>California Sea Bass</mark></mark> loup de mer - crispy skin and cooked perfectly.  the mousseline was nice.\n\npan roasted bone-in veal costoletta - sorry veal haters :(  this was very well cooked and despite being under the heat lamp for longer than the chef would have liked i'm sure (read above) it still was cooked very well and was tender as can be.  the risotto was oh so savory.\n\nfrom the words of my party, the salmon was the best that they have ever had, the halibut was so good that it resulted in a clean plate, and the filet was just ridiculous and served with the wgp signature bone marrow.\n\ni love good food and wgp never disappoints.  many thanks to our good friends for a great meal and next meal is on us.",

            "my husband and i went on a trip to vegas and i had heard how wonderful wolfgang puck was as a chef. so we decided to dine at spago. we had <mark><mark>Three Oysters on the Half Shell</mark></mark> for an appetizer, i think pasta for our meal and some dessert. the dessert sounded so appetizing on the menu but i was very disappointed. the food was over priced and had no flavor.  it made me sick to pay for my meal when i did not enjoy any of it. i just kept thinking this is such a waste of money.", 
            "my bff and i came here for an apertif, so we sat at the bar for a couple drinks and light bites. the bar was very lovely and our bartender was delightful. it was a wonderful setting for a nice evening out.\n\ni opted for <mark><mark>Three Oysters on the Half Shell</mark></mark> ($22 for half dozen). the selection was pickling pass oysters served with red wine ginger mignonette. the oysters and mignonette were great, but unfortunately had broken-off shell bits everywhere.\n\nwe also shared the cheese plate ($25):\nflora nelle organic blue cheese: organic cows milk, aged 6 months\nt\\u00eate de moine: triple cream cow's milk, aged 2 weeks; burgundy, france\nbrillat savarin: semi-soft part skim cheese; aoc, switzerland \nchimay \\u00e0 la bi\\u00e9re trappiste: pasteurized cow's milk, semi-soft, washed with beer; belgium\npyrennes pilota vach-brebis: aged 3 months, pasteurized sheep's milk; aquitaine, france\n\nthe cheese was served with cherry walnut bread, candied walnuts, raisins, apples, and honey. everything was really nice. i enjoyed all the cheeses, especially the t\\u00eate de moine and brillat savarin (one of my favorites).\n\nfor beverages, i had a moscow mule ($12): russian standard vodka, lime juice, fever-tree ginger beer and my bff had the shogun ($15): yamasaki 12-year, cocchi americano, honey yuzu tea, and lemon juice. both selections were great."

            "pricyyyyyyyy :( but the service is excellent; the waiters were around constantly making sure we were all right and that our cups were filled! i have only ever gone here for lunch, which was pretty good with decent prices, but for dinner:\n\nseafood appetizer special: very pricy...there was four of everything (oysters, <mark><mark>Chilled Jumbo Shrimp</mark></mark> cocktail, and a spoonful of crab salad). not worth the $ in my opinion, but the food was indeed fresh and quite delish.\n\nhong kong style salmon: being of hong kong descent, it didn't really taste \"hong kong\" to me...had a weird twang from the soy sauce. salmon was very soft and cooked just right though. vegetables had the same weird twang, but was still edible.\n\n<mark><mark>California Sea Bass</mark></mark>: yum! i got mine gluten free (yes, gluten allergy sucks!) and the waiter reassured my terrified little brain that they dealt with allergies of all kinds all the time and that they would be sure to keep my gluten allergy in mind. so my meal is a bit different from the usual...it really consisted of an excellently cooked <mark><mark>California Sea Bass</mark></mark> with a bunch of buttery chopped greens on the bottom. pretty good.\n\ndiver scallops: came with this cool foam on top. scallops i felt could be cooked to a more golden tone, but it was still good. i kept biting in some sand or something though.\n\nthe meals were way too pricey for the amount we got, but i guess in classier restaurants, that's just the way it is! presentation was amazing and everything was cooked to perfection. employees were very professional and friendly...i'd come here again, but maybe for lunch so my wallet won't implode.", 
            "i came here for a quick lunch with my family before we left to drive back to la. after doing a little last minute shopping in caesar's we got hungry and decided to try spago. we all shared the chicken <mark><mark>Italian Sausage Pizza</mark></mark>, their handcut fettuccini with shrimp, a burger, and a plate of their calamari. the prices here were actually pretty decent for vegas, as were the portion sizes. the pizza was very warm and crispy, but a bit too thin for my liking, as i usually prefer pizzas that are thicker and heavier. i think my favorite dishes of our meal had to be the fettuccini and calamari. the calamari was breaded nicely and chewy like how calamari should be. however, the crowd favorite was definitely the handcut fettuccini. the fettuccini came with 3 fresh pieces of <mark><mark>Chilled Jumbo Shrimp</mark></mark> served on top a nice warm bed of noodle-like pasta. i say \"noodle-like\" because unlike most pastas, spago's fettuccini had a texture that was more like the texture of asian egg noodles.\n\nthe only complaint i had was that in contrary to the what others mentioned in their reviews, my family was not at all offered bread and had to ask both our waiter, and the woman who seemed to be the head waitress, twice for a plate of bread. not only that, but they didn't serve the bread to us until the rest of our food was out as well."

            "this was the dinner i have long been waiting for during my whole trip in vegas.  for the first time, my friends and i decided that it's time to go eat somewhere nice for once instead of mc d's and chipotle everyday meal.  we originally were split into two tables since they told us they can only accommodate 8 ppl max per table.  when we arrived they were able to put both of our tables together.  one thing i didn't like about this idea was that dealing with the check would be a hassle.  but thankfully the waitress was able to split our table's check into two.  major brownie pts!  \n\nnow to the food.  i don't know what my friends ordered, but i'm sure they were delicious.\n\ni ordered:\n\ntrio of <mark>Big-Eye Tuna Tartare & Sashimi</mark>, avocado, daikon radish, scallion and yuzu-wasabi\ncrispy rice cake, marinated cucumber & hearts of palm with soy ceviche-ginger vinaigrette\ntartare, sesame tuile \"taco\" with chili mayo and masago caviar\n\nthis dish was served to perfection!  each small taster was amazingly delicious.  the <mark>Big-Eye Tuna Tartare & Sashimi</mark> was paired perfectly with the daikon radish, scallion and yuzu-wasabi.  the crispy rice cake was awwwesome!  i mean the fish was good, but fried rice cake...mmmmm!  the tartare had a spicy kick to it, but not enough to make you scream to death.\n\ncolorado rack of lamb\ngreen garbanzo falafel, english pea hummus, marinated heirloom tomato fattoush,\nmint-cilantro tzatziki and zhatar\n\nyum!  the lamb was cooked perfectly.  it was slightly pink in the middle, but not bloody.  the falafel was delicious!  i swear these taste like meat, but not. haha\n\nmy friend ordered:\n\npan seared breast of duck\nsemolina fondue, morel mushrooms, cipollini onions, carrots, peas,\nglazed cherries and sauce \\u00e0 l'orange\n\nwhat more can i ask for?  normally when i go to a nice restaurant i usually choose the duck or the lamb.  tonight i had the experience to try both.  it was sure mouth watering!  really moist and succulent.  just delicious! mmmmmm i can go for some right now!\n\ndessert:\n\nsince this was for my birthday...they gave me a free dessert.  a cheese cake with mixed berries on top and a raspberry sorbet on the side.  it was very cheesy and tart.  i'm not a dessert kind of guy, but a free dessert is always yummy.\n\noverall, if you haven't tried out spago yet...i highly recommend it!", 
            "ate here after seeing \"absinthe\" at ceasar's with the help from some yelp reviews. took a seat at the cafe. enjoyed the calamari, <mark>Big-Eye Tuna Tartare & Sashimi</mark>, kobe sliders and finally the prosciutto pizza all with a glass of albarinho. the pizza was delicious. the sliders were good as well as the calamari and  sashimi. our server was helpful and playful. overall, this was a great option for good food at an affordable price as dinner and wine for 2 was just under $100.", 
            "spago by wolfgang puck, his signature restaurant in las vegas\n\nthe decor is modern with warm oranges and red color schemes.  the restaurant is expansive, with a second floor, a bar area and an \"outdoor\" seating area so you can people watch as shoppers walk by.  we were seated on the first floor in a little raised area where we were the first diners of the night to sit there yet still had amazing service.\n\nwolfgang puck is known for his amazing modern american cuisine and as a treat for ourselves, we went for the chef's tasting menu.  officially 6 courses, we ended up with what seemed to be 8 courses.  for $95, you get a lot of food while you could end up paying somewhere in the $30s for an entree.  chef eric klein did not disappoint with small portions of his most popular menu items for tasting with some items that weren't available for order on any menu at spago, lunch or dinner.   \n\nbread: as many reviewers have noted, spago's bread platter is well known for very good reason.  with four choices that night, sourdough, cranberry walnut, flat bread and foccacia, you could not go wrong with any.  dipping platter:  olive oil infused with rosemary, salt, pepper and butter.  the bread was very good as advertised, something that i tried to pace myself with knowing that i had the tasting menu to come.\n\namuse bouche: duo of american kobe beef \"sliders\" brioche buns, bread-butter pickles, red onions, smoked gouda, house made ketchup, chilled maryland blue crab salad fragrant herbs, avocado, grapefruit segments, lemon vinaigrette and basil pistou\n-melt in your mouth kobe beef, a perfect bite with the pickles providing just enough tang but the crab salad was what stole the show.  the grapefruit and lemon vinaigrette was unbeatable in cutting through the richness of the crab salad.  amazing bite\n\nfirst course: margarita flambe: mozzarella, fontina, parmesan, goat cheese with garden tomatoes and basil\n-crispy and flaky crust with an intense tomato flavor.  the flambe was good, something that didn't stand out too much at the end of the dinner, great contrast between the crust and the flavor of the toppings\n\nsecond course: duo of yellowfin <mark>Big-Eye Tuna Tartare & Sashimi</mark>: watercress salad, lychee, chive and aji limon and avocado, daikon radish, scallion and yuzu-wasabi\n-served in a perfect ice sculpture, the presentation was dramatic.  each sashimi bite had incredibly fresh seafood, the tuna being highlighted by the lychee and  by the yuzu, very yummy flavorful punches\n\nthird course: soup/salad: farmers' market cauliflower soup\ntrumpet royale mushrooms, arugula and basil oil olsen farm's baby arugula salad farmers' market apple, shaved fennel, burrata cheese, prosciutto san daniele, ice wine vinegar and olive oil\n-the soup was very creamy, had hints of potato but was made with pureed cauliflower, the arugula and basil oil was a great way to cut through the creaminess, very yummy with a great balanced salad.  the apple, fennel and cheese were complimented by the ice wine.  overall, great course\n\nfourth course: hand rolled, ricotta gnocchi with porrcini mushrooms, black truffle butter, cheese foam,\nthe best course of the night! there is no way to describe the pillowy, fluffy gnocchi, this course is not available anywhere on the menu day or night, it can only be had through the tasting menu.  the heartiness of the mushrooms with the black truffle butter, was insanely delicious, i could eat this dish every day for a long time\n\nfifth course: grilled french <mark><mark>California Sea Bass</mark></mark> loup de mer: artichokes, baby carrots, haricot vert, cipollini, arugula, fennel pur\\u00e9e, artichokes barigoule broth au pistou\n-perfectly cooked fish, flaky with a crispy crust.  the broth was something that could've been drunk without any accompaniment, very tasty and the accompanying vegetables were great for the fish.\n\nsixth course: mesquite grilled prime filet mignon: sweet & sour red onions, celery, watercress, bone marrow crushed <mark><mark>Tuscan Fingerling Potatoes</mark></mark> and armagnac peppercorn sauce pistachio crusted colorado lamb chops\ncheese on top of the lamb, pickled beets and onions with balsamic reduction\n-the lamb was tender, with the peppercorn flavor coming right through and the filet mignon was tender and tasty.  after all the big bold flavors in the past courses, the meat course was a little lacking but still very tasty if i had just had that course.  i was still hooked on that gnocchi.\n\npalate cleanser: blood orange and passionfruit sorbet over blueberries\n-yummy sorbet that had a touch of bitterness that did its job, cleanse your palate after that long meal.  i ate the whole thing, def not just a palate cleanser\n\ndesert: crepe: dark chocolate, hazelnut, creme fraiche with orange glaze\n-great crepe, with just enough body in the crepe to balance the hazelnute and dark chocolate\n\noverall, great attentive service, great food, was greeted by eric klein himself, would do it again in a heartbeat if i had unlimited funds, well worth the money", 
            "with so many restaurants to go to, it's sometimes tough to pull the trigger on one.  a friend chose spago.  it was awesome!  we started with their margarita and <mark>Big-Eye Tuna Tartare & Sashimi</mark> flatbreads.  i then could not decide between a spanish inspired seared ahi tuna or a french inspired halibut...chef klein happened to walk by and following a few minutes of pleasant conversation, i choice the halibut...amazing!  banana bread pudding was a great conclusion.  only negative is that it would have been nice to have a broader variety of reasonably priced wines.  highly recommend.",

            "goodness me...this place is amazing. \n\nmy fiance and i were walking around and even though we weren't that hungry, we wanted to stuff our faces anyway because we're fatties. i came to spago three years ago (don't remember anything from then except that i liked it) so i recommended it. \n\nfirst off, top notch service. our waiter was friendly but not too overwhelmingly so. he left us alone to chat and enjoy our meal. we started off with a sangria topped with sweet fruit chunks that my fiance devoured. \nthen we ordered: (descriptions posted from their cafe menu at http://www.wolfgangpuck.com/restaurants/fine-dining/9044)\n\n<mark>Big-Eye Tuna Tartare & Sashimi</mark> -crispy rice cake, marinated cucumbers, hearts of palm with wasabiginger vinaigrette. best sushi i have ever had in my life! the sashimi melted in your mouth while the rice cake added just enough crisp to give it a little zing. the sauces complemented the flavors perfectly! \n\nand since we weren't too hungry, we split the wood-fired mushroom pizza which consisted of roasted portabellas, caramelized white onions, italian parsley and parmesan. i don't even really like portabellas and this was the best pizza ever. the cheese was great but not too cheesy, the pizza felt light and tasty, and the crust was perfectly baked and crunchy. i have died and gone to food heaven. \n\none of the best meals i've ever had, period. a must visit while in vegas! located inside of the forum shops at cesar's palace so a perfect break while shopping and walking! if you order the cafe menu, the environment is more relaxing and less expensive than the dinner, although dinner is great too!", 
            "a week ago we celebrated a birthday for my dear friend from nyc.  it was my idea for her to spend her birthday wkend in this infamous sin city, but it was our mutual friend from santa monica that hooked us up with a fabulous dining experience here at spago.\nso i admit, this review may be a bit skewed since our party of 6 received vip treatment... our friend knows the executive chef, eric klein and his wife. we were greeted by both of them, which was pretty cool. \n\nthe front of the restaurant has a more casual vibe with the open pseudo-patio facing the forum shops. we were led to the back of the restaurant which was the fine dining area. i immediately noticed sinatra playing in the background, which i love. we basically had a phenomenal 5 or more tastings prior to our chosen individual main entree.  the sommelier suggested an amazing red wine from santa rita hills: gypsy canyon... and i thought i was done with pinot noirs, but this wine was atypical for a pinot noir. it wasn't light, but more medium body and fruit forward. it paired beautifully with everything we ate. so i can't recall the order of what was presented to us... <mark>Big-Eye Tuna Tartare & Sashimi</mark>, amazingly fresh scallop, flavorful fennel soup... i admit i should have written this last week, because i can't recall each & every dish.  my main entree that i chose was the grilled french <mark><mark>California Sea Bass</mark></mark> which was absolutely delicious!  and dessert was decadent influences of chocolate... each of the 3 or 4 types of pastry was out of control... sinfully scrumptious!\n\nwe were definitely spoiled with exceptional delectable dishes and outstanding service.", 
            "wow. spago really blew me away. started off dinner with a carefully sculpted <mark>Big-Eye Tuna Tartare & Sashimi</mark>, arranged to look like an opening bloom. followed that with sauteed scallops, which were perfectly caramelized on both sides. and because i just couldn't get enough, i had to have the chocolate layered cake. \n\nservice was top-notch. executive chef eric klein was a regular on the floor and chatting with patrons. you could tell he really cared about the diners. he sent along a free butternut squash soup amuse bouche my way and ended the meal with a petit four, also gratis. \n\nhonestly, it was a meal that could've gone on forever. i didn't want it to end!",

            "spago was very accommodating to our party of 12. the staff was flexible with the change of our reservations and additional folks to our party. \n\nfood & drinks:\ni had the corn soup and <mark>Big-Eye Tuna Tartare & Sashimi</mark>. i wanted something light for dinner and this combination hit the spot. the corn soup does not appear to wow you upon first sight. no worries though because it all came down to taste. this is hands down the absolute best corn soup i have ever had in my life. i decided to share my soup experience with my friends and everyone was shocked as well. the soup is not too heavy but very fulfilling. the <mark>Big-Eye Tuna Tartare & Sashimi</mark> was also delicious and refreshing. i ordered a moscow mule after another patron sent over the same drink anonymously to our bride to be. we figured it out later and it was a nice russian couple who sent their congrats. \n\noverall it was a fabulous experience. order the corn soup!",

            "i've been here a couple of times and enjoyed both of them.  the last time we came the service was great, the food was excellent and the wine perfectly complimented it.  i had picked out my food from the menu when the waitress came by with some great specials.  a <mark><mark>Caprese Salad</mark></mark> with a wonderful variety of tomatoes... delish!  and their bread basket is great!  a large assortment to choose from to tide you over before your meal.  and they gave oil, butter and sea salt to go with it.  yum!  a nice place to go that's not too fancy but still serves delicious, high quality food.", 
            "i know i probably shouldn't be this impressed with spago but it blows my socks off! i've eaten here twice while in vegas on two separate visits. i actually wish i would have eaten here more each time. this past occasion we were debating not going to spago just because we had eaten here last time and there are so many places we just didn't get to try. however, someone made the brilliant decision that we were going to spago again and i'm thankful because this was once again my favorite meal in vegas.\n \nto start off i have to mention the awesome bread basket, so delicious, the flat bread, the sweet bread, the sourdough ahh my mouth is watering as i write this. the accompanying sea salt, butter and olive oil is also amazing.\n\non this trip to spago we sat \"outside\" and were able to order off of the cafe menu and the dinner menu. \n\nlast time we ordered the oysters and we remember how amazing they truly were by ordering them again. spago's oysters are the best and freshest in las vegas, if you eat oysters or just want to try them get them here.\n\nthis time there were 7 of us so we got to try a lot of menu items. \n\nthere were two orders of the special salad that night which was <mark><mark>Caprese Salad</mark></mark> with heirloom tomatoes and buffalo mozzerella. it was fantastic. i ordered the olsen farm's baby arugula salad, farmers' market pear & fig, shaved fennel, burrata cheese, prosciutto san daniele, ice wine vinegar and olive oil. i had them put the proscuitto on the side and someone else ate it. the salad was intense. the creamy burrata accompanied with the fresh fig and pears, so good. get this if you have a chance. \n\ni also ordered the farmer's market white corn soup, trumpet royale mushrooms, caramelized cipollini onions, fava beans, cherry tomatoes, arugula and basil oil. this was the all-star of the night for everyone who tasted it. it was so fresh and savory i would have licked the bowl if it would have been appropriate.\n\nfor entree's we had 3 orders of the hand cut fettuccini, wild oregon mushrooms, english peas, arugula, glazed shallots, parmesan-reggiano. this was a popular dish the last time we ate here so one of us ordered it again and two others joined along. it was as delicious as we remembered.\n\n2 orders of the caserecci pasta a la bolognaise,braised beef, roasted double blanched garlic, plum tomatoes, house made ricotta cheese. both people who ordered this loved it. \n\nunagi glazed scottish <mark><mark>Teriyaki Glazed Salmon Salad</mark></mark>, romaine lettuce, daikon radish, shiso, avocado, carrot r\\u00e9moulade , steamed jasmine rice, japanese vinaigrette. it looked beautiful.\n\nspago pancetta-wrapped meatloaf, russet potato pur\\u00e9e, mushroom gravy, port wine sauce, onion rings. my friend who ordered this jokingly said his was better, which he says about all food items but he thoroughly enjoyed it. \n\nto top it off we had another birthday here and this time they brought us out an assortment of cookies. we were all completely stuffed but we some how made some room for these cookies. \n\nlast but not least, for the quality of the food the pricing is on point. there are a ton of place in vegas that take your hard earned money while you sit back and wonder if it was really worth it. this is not one of them.\n\nthank you spago, when i return to vegas i will visit, more than once this time.", 
            "from start to finish everything was spectacular! i absolutely recommend this place to everyone. i love wolfgang but this place was by far his best restaurant i've been to. the service was beyond amazing. i ordered ice tea and i only had 3 sips a server replaced my drink bc my ice was melting now that's service! our main server ingrid was beyond pleasant, she was very friendly and by far the best service i've ever had. now if only we could get that kind of service at boa steakhouse! \n\nwe ordered the <mark><mark>Caprese Salad</mark></mark>, roast beef, and my favorite the salmon w jasmine rice and bok choy hong kong style! by far this is the best salmon i've had in my life. if only spago is in la, i would definitely come to this restaurant every week! very nice ambiance, excellent food and service what more can you ask for?! one of my favorite restaurant in the whole country!", 
            "had lunch here with family and had a great time. the service was attentive and the food arrived promptly and tasted delicious. the butternut squash soup was yummy, the new york strip tender, and the <mark><mark>Caprese Salad</mark></mark> refreshing. pricier dishes but definitely worth it in my opinion.", 
            "this was my first time going to this restaurant. our server cody did an amazing job. we ordered the <mark><mark>Caprese Salad</mark></mark>, prosciutto pizza, and the atlantic salmon. everything was absolutely delicious and i will definitely be back again.", 
            "hubby and i decided to lunch here recently. it was a bit past the lunch hour, and the restaurant was not terribly busy. we asked to sit at a table along the railing facing the forum mall interior, so we could people watch, and we were obliged. the table was lovely with crisp white linen and nice silverware, and our hostess, and then our server, was personable and attentive. even the busboy was friendly and always kept our water glasses full. everyone was on point here. no lapses in service at all.\n\nas for the food.... man, it was good! hubby had a blt burger and he said it was perfectly cooked and delicious. i had a <mark><mark>Caprese Salad</mark></mark> and it was so delicate, with both the slabs of heirloom tomatoes and the small halved cherry tomatoes on the side were at the exact perfect nano-second of ripeness. i'm not sure if they reduced the balsamic and oil or what they did, but the drizzle of dressing was the finest of any <mark><mark>Caprese Salad</mark></mark> i've ever had (and i've had plenty). it was not in the least harsh or acidic; it was faintly sweet and even appeared different, with a greenish hue. it was divine. \n\nwhat a great place for lunch! we'd return for sure when we're next in town."

            "this review is long overdue. i've probably eaten here at least 15 times over the last 4-5 years and i don't think i've ever had a bad meal here. it is one of the most consistent places i've been in vegas. \nwe usually try to eat at the spago cafe in the \"outside\" patio as opposed to the more formal and expensive main restaurant area. i found out on my last visit though that the lunch menu is the same for both areas but if you want a more casual and less pricey dinner, i would stick with the cafe. you will still get a great experience and a fantastic meal either way. \nmany of the dishes here rotate seasonally but some of the best stay on the menu year round. make sure to sample the bread basket, i love that crispy cracker thing they serve. my husband says the free range chicken here is just about the best chicken he's had. i always get the gazpacho here when they have it but unfortunately, that only seems to be a few months a year. however, their soups are amazing here. on my last visit, i had a cream of mushroom soup that came with a fancy grilled cheese sandwich and it was mouthwatering. one of the best soups i can remember having. some of the other dishes i've tried that i've enjoyed were the pappardele (although it is a bit on the heavy side) as well as the <mark><mark>Chinese Chicken Salad</mark></mark> sandwich. spago is known for their pizzas but it's been a long time since i've ordered that here so i really can't comment on that. \nall in all i love the food here and i love what this restaurant represents to vegas. this was pretty much the first high end restaurant to open in vegas in the early 90s and people were shocked that it did well. if not for spago's success, vegas would not be the high end dining mecca it has become.", 
            "we were looking for a casual, delicious lunch and we found it at spago.\n\nwe were seated near the cafe patio, which made for good people-watching.  i could have made my meal out of the bread basket that arrived first, especially with the crispy parmesean crisps and the cherry walnut bread.\n\nbut i did peel myself away to order a glass of wine (yummy $7 pino grigio--cheap compared to drinks i'd purchased that weekend) and the <mark><mark>Chinese Chicken Salad</mark></mark> sandwich.  the sandwich--filling, but not too much--came with kettle chips and a mixed green salad with a light vinaigrette.  it hit the spot.  wish we'd had room for dessert; maybe next time.\n\nour service was prompt and unobtrusive.  we definitely will be back.",

            "the forum shops is my favorite mall so i'm there often and always go to spago!! it's always consistent- the service is always great and the food is good. i've tried many different things from their menu and never really had anything that i did not like!! \n\ni always start with the fried calamari. i love it!! it is delicious. the sweet chili sauce it comes with is delicious and the cucumber salad that it comes with is delicious!! though i get it every time, there is one thing i would change about it. i would use seasoned breadcrumbs!! if the breadcrumbs they use are seasoned, you really cannot tell at all. i know the sauce is supposed to provide the flavor but the calamari just needs a little kick. \n\nother items that i have tried that are very good are the black truffle fettucine, roasted organic chicken, spaghetti, chicken parm sandwich, asian <mark><mark>Chinese Chicken Salad</mark></mark> - they were all good and i would recommend any of those items!!\n\nand my favorite thing - the olive oil that they give in addition to sea salt and butter for the bread bowl. this olive oil is amazing!! it's very potent and has an intense flavor that i can't really describe but i end up dipping my chicken in it, french fries, calamari, potatoes, i will put that olive oil on anything!!!\n\nthe ambiance of this place is average. it's considered high end dining but i find it to be extremely casual. my boyfriend goes there in a hat and sneakers and they don't mind. i like it though - great food and not a stuffy place at all. the servers are always really cool too!!", 
            "my number 1 place in vegas.  superior lunch.  finally had the <mark><mark>Chinese Chicken Salad</mark></mark> sandwich on the walnut cherry bread with the housemade salt n vionegar kettle chips and frisee salad.  awesome.  enjoyed the chopped vegetable and chinois <mark><mark>Chinese Chicken Salad</mark></mark>.  wife enjoyed the curry shrimp.  superior service by james.  came here near close for salad and pizza after santana concert. at the bar with peter, a pro's pro.  best woodfire pizza in the business still.", 
            "oh spago, you were a shining light of good food and service in las vegas!  turkey club sandwich rates a very good! side salad deliciousness. asian <mark><mark>Chinese Chicken Salad</mark></mark> was superior!  wait staff (james) was professional, attentive, engaging and fun!  a breath of fresh air in a town full of jaded employees (who wouldn't be?). enjoy spago! a lovely treat!", 
            "felt  level of service, once the cornerstone of this spago location, has dropped a notch. we sat at the bar where pro s like peter and tony once ruled the fortress. these guys looked like they were in grade school. effecient but dry, not friendly. we weren't brought or even offered a bread basket despite ordering a full dinner. sorry but that is weak. we also saw amd heard some animated bickering between a female bartender and a server. the short chubby gm guy who has been there awhile watched it from afar without stopping it or letting them know this type of behavior was unacceptable.  this gm seems to have gotten complacent in his job.  if i were a higher up in puck enterprises, id give this guy a dressing down or a demotion. this is not the spago i once knew.\n\nyet make no mistake. the food is still great. executive chef eric klein has put the puck staple chinois <mark><mark>Chinese Chicken Salad</mark></mark> on the spring 2013 menu and this salad is as good as any you will eat. the hong kong stlyle salmon was excellent. the rigatoni bolognese was stellar, however a bit rich. id recommend getting it easy sauce.\n\nwe didnt get dessert. a dessert menu was not offered to us either, again another sign of our first overall less than stellar spago experience.\n\n2 days later, with limited time before we had to head to airport, we went to the spago bar for a quick bite.  i told the female bartender with green eyes and freckles that i needed the food rushed. my wife got a salad and i ordered a pizza.  both were great.  the pie had too much cheese on it imo. wood fire pies are cooked at high heats for a short time. generally they need to have limited sauce and cheese.  was still solid and i forgot to ask for ez cheese like i always do.  this bartender was solid.  offered us bread despite the casual curcumstances and time of day. she was friendly but professional and got us our food out within 13-14 minutes.\n\nwe will be back as it is one of our favorite spots in vegas.  we hope to see the old familiar faces and the level of service we are accustomed to.", 
            "the food at spago is still very good but not as great as before. \n\nhowever, the level of service and warmth of staff is no longer the same. dont recognize most faces anymore and there lies the problem. the short balding gm has scowl on his face. if he isnt dry with us, he is barking at his staff.\n\nwe werent offered bread for dinner and lunch visits.  the pizza wasnt cooked well done as asked. the chinois <mark><mark>Chinese Chicken Salad</mark></mark> was way too spicy and overdressed. it has changed here. they need to learn how to make it like they do at puck's bar & grill at mgm which has really superceded spago in menu selection, flavor, and service.\n\nthe cuban style sandwich for lunch was excellent. i ate half and told her to pack the rest of my plate to go. bridget packed the leftover samdwich to go but not the housemade chips. that is lame.\n\nthe prime beef sliders..amazing. but 3 the size of a quarter each for $16...insulting\n\ndessert menu...lame\n\nthere was a time where spago was las vegas headquarters for us. read my past reviews. couple meals and couple visits to the bar at a minimum. those days are over.\n\nwe will eat here once for lunch on follwing trips, and that all.", 
            "what a wonderful restaurant.  they have stood the test of time.  always excellent service and good food at a reasonable price.  wolfgang's chinese take on <mark><mark>Chinese Chicken Salad</mark></mark> still is the best!  never miss this restaurant when i come to vegas.  only bummer is they have changed their dessert menu; don't like the changes.", 
            "i must say, i was pleasantly surprised by how great everything was; the service, portions, price (made sense), taste. \nwe ordered the asian <mark><mark>Chinese Chicken Salad</mark></mark> (has a dif name but i cant think of it at <mark>Spago Cold Pressed Juice of the Moment</mark>), the meatloaf, and 2 desserts. \nall portions were big enough to split among 2 or maybe even 3, depending on your appetite. \nthe salad didn't have too much dressing and had this crunch that i always enjoy in a salad so that was a great start. \nas for the meatloaf, i normally don't even consider eating meatloaf (for personal reasons) but my aunt recommended it and i can see why. very well balanced and probably one of the best i've had (but then again i haven't had much so...)\nas for dessert, we ordered key lime, light yet satisfying. \n\ndefinitely recommend!\n\nps. this review is extremely late as i just noticed i never clicked \"submit\"", 
            "the food was delicious, enough to warrant 5 stars easily. however, i really didn't like the service. we put our names down(without reservation, and on am evening, i can understand that there can be a wait). the hostess said we'd only wait 20 minutes, so we walked around the forum. after, we came back but our table still wasn't ready. we went to the bar and had overpriced, weak, and too sweet mojitos. my dad kept trying to nicely ask the hostess if she knew when our table would be ready, as we saw many open tables and other groups being promptly seated (he didn't mention that, though, because he isn't rude). however, she was very short with him and would keep making a point to not walk near us. \n\nalso, i went to the bathroom at some point, and the other hostess who came in opened the door quite briskly and almost hit me hard. she kept walking by me without any apology or acknowledgement. overall, the hostesses seemed much more stuck-up than they needed to be. \n\nour waiter was really nice, but the busboys were rude. one poured water without thinking and spilled water on our canon camera. he also took away my mom's drink when she was only halfway done with it. we did mention this to our waiter who felt terrible and got her a new one for free.\n\nagain, the saving grace here was the food. the pizza is out of this world. the <mark><mark>Chinese Chicken Salad</mark></mark> was incredible - huge portion but maybe could have used more greens. the pasta sauces were flavorful. even the bread loaf given to us was fresh.\n\nhowever, i really wasn't comfortable due to the service. we may have been tourists, but we weren't obnoxious or tacky. we were dressed quite nicely too. we spent good money there and could have been treated better.", 
            "i decided to try spago for lunch.  i was greeted and sat immediately.  i ordered the chinois <mark><mark>Chinese Chicken Salad</mark></mark> and an ice tea (tropical).    the service is so good at spago.  i would drink half of my ice tea and it would be filled up immediately.   the salad is the best <mark><mark>Chinese Chicken Salad</mark></mark> that you will eat.  i have had this before and it never disappoints.   a must if you don't have the original where you live.", 
            "not the same spago we used to know. peter, the bartender is gone. chicago tom is long gone. james, is gone.  servers wearing jeans???\n\nwe ate here twice. both times lunch. on our first arrival, we sat at host station for 5 minutes unattended as waiters and cooks and busboys stared at us.  when the host finally did arrive, he ofcourse did not apologize and ask us if we had waited long. than he tried giving me a tight spot in between 2 other couples eventhough the cafe was 66% empty. i said no. then he tried giving me a small table next to rail...i said no again. \n\nthat said the quality of the food is still excellent. the <mark><mark>Chinese Chicken Salad</mark></mark>, spago chopped (they should list cheese as ingredient in menu... we had to send it back), <mark><mark>Chinese Chicken Salad</mark></mark> sandwich and <mark><mark>Pepperoni Pizza</mark></mark> were phenomenal.  our servers were good. solid.\n\nperhaps executive chef eric klein is hamstrung by corporate and wolfgang himself at this flagship, but this menu is getting stale and old.  needs to be freshened up.\n\nat this point, i like lupo and puck bar & grill more. spago needs a breath of fresh air.  it is living in the past.", 
            "delicious <mark><mark>House Smoked Salmon Pizza</mark></mark> (their specialty) that is loaded full with delicious fresh salmon.\n\nthe <mark><mark>Chinese Chicken Salad</mark></mark> is a great compliment and totally delicious.  the greens are diverse and include watercrest and they r super fresh.  the salad tastes like a gourmet coleslaw without all the mayo.\n\nattentive and friendly staff.  fast service.",

            "this was the first place my bf and i ended up eating at while visiting las vegas. we went for dinner around 10 pm friday night. the restaurant wasn't busy but there were still a few full tables. the food here was amazing. we ordered the <mark><mark>Chinese Chicken Salad</mark></mark> and the mushroom goat cheese pizza.  both were fantastic. the only downside to the restaurant was the service. for the place to only be 25% full it was sometime hard getting a hold of our waitress. overall though a great dinning experience and we would eat here again.", 
            "spago was by far the best meal i had in vegas and it was for lunch. we did the prosciutto/fig salad and it was delicious! we also had a pizza and the <mark><mark>Chinese Chicken Salad</mark></mark> sandwich- awesome. if you are from the east coast (we are spoiled with awesome food) you should try this place to get the closest to home taste and very affordable! staff was great as well."

            "this really was a treat that i didn't see coming. we were trying to go to mesa grill, but it was pucking facked. so you can tell, i was feeling something big and beefy which probably colored my menu selections a bit. enough about me, more about spago. note they have 2 different menus depending on where you sit (cafe and dining room). we sat in the dining room. \n\ngroup of 3 of us arrived at about 7:30 on a thursday, no wait at all (kind of atypical in vegas!). we sat down, were served super promptly, and got  an amuse bouche of potato leek soup brought out right away. awesome. they have a couple gin oddities on their bar, so i got a gin martini. almost lost some points since the waiter asked if i wanted a lime in it (that would be a gimlet, not a martini). but whatevs. the martini was done very well...it had a remarkable floral scent to it quite a treat...try the cape rock organic gin. it was also $14, but that seems more the norm than the exception in vegas.  \n\ni had the most elegantly presented <mark><mark>Heirloom Tomato Soup</mark></mark> in the entire world.  the waiter brought a covered bowl to my table, lifted the top off, and there was a beautiful dense red soup with a pine branch drawn into the top of the soup using a olive oil/basil sauce. stunning. and the soup was great too...the crouton served with it matched perfectly. very very well done here.\n\nsince i was in a meaty/grilly mood (expecting to head to a flay joint), i got the kobe <mark><mark>Grilled Flat Iron Steak</mark></mark>. it was also exceptional. the steak was perfectly well done, nice and chewy (its a flatiron people, it should be chewy), but not tough at all. it was served with some broccolini which fit this dish perfectly. i'm only sorry i was too full for dessert.  \n\nthey brought out an assortment of bread in a basket before the appetizers, and i was having a tough time choosing between them since they all sounded great. after i made a tough choice for the bread i had selected, the waiter asked if i wanted something else. it was perfect - i was able to sample all of the breads that sounded great to me. he also came back 2-3 times during the meal to see if we wanted any more. also, our water glasses never got below 1/3 full. its weird, i've always wondered why the mid-high end restuarants typically don't have this kind of service, when you are clearly going to pay a fair chunck of change for dinner. its awesome to see a place that really aims to please you in every way possible. also, the wait staff was generally transparent during the meal even though they were doing a lot of work clearing our table, customizing cutlery, filling water, etc.\n\nthe dining area is perfectly decorated. its a little trendy, but not blinking red light and technoey. the decor is so right because you can walk in there wearing anything (ahem...within reason) and not feel out of place. its great for any age group - 20ish to 60ish. its a little loud, but not disruptivley so. you are going to have to pay a bit for this place (app, dinner, and a single martini ran me $100 after tip), but i'd do it again on my own dime in a heartbeat.\n\nits one of those rare 5 star places. well done sir puck.", 
            "i absolutely loved this place. one of my best meal experiences. \n\nthat said, i will begin with the truth. i had my doubts. i only knew a handful of things about wolfgang puck: (1) he's a celebrity chef, (2) he haz an accent, and (3) he cooks for the oscars. s'it. \n\nthis could have gone either way. it could be amazing because, well, he cooks for ze movie stars and he wouldn't be world famous if his food was awful. or, it could all just be hype.  \n\nwell, wolfgang puck is amazing, and he is famous for a reason. because his talent is delicious. \n\nthe food: we totally conquered. \n\nthe white peach bellini was one of or probably the best bellini i ever had. each sip was like biting into a crisp, juicy, succulent white peach. even though it didn't seem like very much in the glass, i got a nice little buzz from it. that must be quality champagne. \n\nthe bread waiters came and offered you as much as you wanted from a bountiful basket. we got to choose from a sourdough, a cherry walnut, an olive loaf, a cracker (with seeds, herbs, and things - since i don't like crackers, this was my least favorite), and an onion focaccia. the soft, slightly sweet, buttery cube of onion focaccia was clearly the favorite of the night. dipped in their quality olive oil, it was a great meal starter. \n\nthe amuse bouche was a cappuccino sized cup of cold, creamy pea soup. it tasted so fresh. as if you plucked the peas yourself, eating them while still standing in a garden, with your toes in the cool dirt. however, since i'm not a cold soup fan, i didn't like it that much. \n\nwe ordered several appetizers to share. the crab cakes, the <mark><mark>Heirloom Tomato Soup</mark></mark>, the warm wild mushroom salad, and the octopus salad. \n\nthe <mark><mark>Heirloom Tomato Soup</mark></mark> was probably my favorite dish of the entire night, and that's saying something since my meal and the warm wild mushroom salad were both incredible. i mean, sooo many wins here. the soup was large, came in a clay-pot sized, white porcelain bowl complete with cute hat, and a crostini that was spread with a creamy white cheese and then piled high with fluffy parmesan. on top of the soup was a thin design of balsamic vinegar that complimented the soup like jelly compliments peanut butter. spooning up a mouthful and letting the fresh tomato, sweet balsamic, exotic herbs, and delicate cream dance in my mouth was a little piece of heaven. \n\nthe warm mushroom salad was layered with mushrooms i can't name, but they were each delicious. some of the mushrooms were delicate, while others were slightly crunchy and \"meaty\" (like portobellos). the salad was tossed warm with arguala and pomegranate seeds and was a heart warming, unique salad that was perfect for a fall day (in windy las vegas). \n\ni ordered the special because i couldn't resist the following words: truffle-cream + alaskan king crab. other words like mushroom, onion, and fettucine were in there as well. it was, of course, awesome. i mean, it had truffle oil in it. truffle oil makes everything better! \n\nmy mom ordered the seafood paella and it was very tasty, though a tad undercooked, imo. the scallops and shrimp were huuuge! the bf ordered what i deemed the \"pig plate\" which consisted of pork belly, pork loin, and 3 kinds of sausage including blood - very neat concept. overall, every single person was over-the-moon pleased with their dinner. \n\nunfortunately (very very), i was over-ruled when it came to dessert. everybody else was too full, so we didn't try any. i bet they're fantastic though. next time... \n\natmosphere: ending with looks and folks. spago is hard, clean lines, it's modern art, mirrors, and black walls. too noisy for an intimate dinner, but fun for a family or group. service was polite, friendly, and extremely accomodating, but i didn't feel all warm and fuzzy like i did at alexander's. it was quite nice when they saw us pouring our own wine and decided to swoop in and do it themselves. nice catch. prices were surprisingly reasonable! you can spend $50 to $150 a person, your choice. \n\ni'm a puck fan now.", 
            "our party of 5 had a reservation, but we still managed to wait at least 15 minutes for our table, even though the restaurant wasn't crowded.  the decor is nice, nothing too impressive/distinct from other places.  for a cocktail, i ordered the peach bellini, which was pretty tasty.  a small tasting of the grilled cheese in <mark><mark>Heirloom Tomato Soup</mark></mark> was given, compliments of the chef.  one of my friends had been craving that combination of flavors, so it hit the spot for her and she loved it.  we ordered the \"seafood platter\" as a starter, but unfortunately, they were out of lobster, which is basically the best part!  for entrees, some ordered the surf and turf, which turned out to be mediocre good; less than expected.  i had the pasta special which i chose the option to have crabmeat with it was satisfying, but not sure i'd order it again.  the executive chef, eric klein, did make rounds throughout the restaurant, stopping by every table to make sure people were pleased.  he did stop by our table a few times, engaging in conversation each time.  turns out we knew some mutual people!", 
            "good service. very good food. enjoyed the sample of <mark><mark>Heirloom Tomato Soup</mark></mark>. had a raw seafood sampler for appetizer and a tuna dinner. all very good. great ambiance also. all around, a great time.", 
            "picky e. is in vegas for the weekend trying out the new restaurant capital of the u.s. friday was spago night. it was a bomb--note, not the bomb, but a bomb. the ambiance is weird--it's in the forum shops and the front opens to a patio to the shops. so, as you go in, you feel like you are going into any mall restaurant anywhere in america. as you go back into the restaurant, you never lose that mall feel.\n\nthe food did not save it. while the amuse was good (a taste of <mark><mark>Heirloom Tomato Soup</mark></mark>), it then took 40 minutes for my chicken to come out. the waiter made various excuses, but since there was no note on the menu saying the chicken takes forever, i am guessing there was some mistake made in the kitchen or by the expediter. when it did come out, it was undercooked--and i mean the kind of undercooked that is plainly visible under dark dinner lighting. so, picky had to send it back. it took another 10 minutes to finish cooking it (a testament to how under-cooked it was the first time and how badly the kitchen was running). mind you, the restaurant was not packed; there were plenty of open tables, tons of front of house staff, etc. so i have no idea what was taking so long in the back of the house.\n\nwhen i did get a food-safety approved plate, it was average. for $40 and 50 minutes, i would have liked a really good piece of chicken. i will give kudos to the vegetable prep cook--those were darn good, but it was hard to save the meal at that point.\n\nso, wolfgang, i think you need to check in on your las vegas digs. it's not living up to the spago brand.", 
            "i went to spago last night before the rod stewart concert and it was superb in every way, the room, the food, and the service!  i asked about the 6 course tasting menu and my server described the courses.  when he knew i had a show at 7:30, he thought i might not have enough time for the meal.  the he said, \"we'll make it happen.  we'll move things along.\"  the meat course was the only course in which i had a choice.  you could choose either a filet or a lamb chop. \n\nin a few minutes, michael brought a tray with four kinds of bread--cheese dusted lavash, cheddar bacon rolls, mini baguettes, and a cherry walnut bread.  i asked for some lavash and the bacon cheddar roll.  i didn't want to fill up on bread.  note:  with the bread, they serve butter with ground salt on top (hooray!)\n\nthe first course was a seafood course.  there were four compartments on the dish and each one had a small portion of a different fish.  the small spoon had crab, to the right there was some tuna, above on the right was a carpaccio of octopus and to the upper left was albacore tataki.  each had seasonings including an avocado pur\\u00e9e on one, a small piece of melon with another and so on.  great presentation.  wonderful flavors!\n\ncourse 2 was the salad course.  there were two parts to this.  one was a small cup of warm <mark><mark>Heirloom Tomato Soup</mark></mark> that was superb.  i asked michael if it was on the menu, but it's not.  it really was tasty.  along with the soup was a salad consisting of a wedge of yellow and red tomato.  it's been a long time since i had tomatoes with so much flesh and almost no seed.  there were 3 or 4 green beans lying diagonally across the tomatoes and there were some small cherry tomatoes and some more avocado pur\\u00e9e.  very light and lots of summer flavor.\n\ncourse 3 was the first fish course.  a bottom layer had a polenta flan.  on this was the grilled eel and on top of the eel was a fried quail egg.  the dish was decorated with some tasty cheese tuile.  the eel was moist and soft and fell apart with just a touch.  it was perfectly cooked!\n\ncourse 4 was the pasta course.  it consisted of agnolotti that was topped with pieces of lobster meat and there was some basil olive oil drizzled around the base of the pasta.  this was excellent also!\n\ncourse 5 was a second fish course--<mark><mark>California Sea Bass</mark></mark>.  the bass was placed on a layer of what appeared to be thin pasta.  after delving deeper, i found that they were extremely thin, narrow slices of yellow and green squash that could have easily been mistaken for pasta until you tasted them.  very clever execution and very tasty <mark><mark>California Sea Bass</mark></mark>.  there was also a piece of melon and a grilled cherry tomato.  you can see how the chef likes to mix contrasting flavors.\n\ncourse 6 was the meat course and i chose the lamb chop (rare).  it was an herb crusted chop that had been removed from the chop with the bone left there to chew on when the main part was gone. there was some pea pur\\u00e9e and some more basil oil.  it was truly superb!\n\nfor dessert, i first got a plate with three sorbets--blackberry, mango, and raspberry--and there was an extremely thin piece of white chocolate placed in the mango.  it was so delicate it almost melted when i picked it up.  then i was brought a pretty plate with grasshopper cheesecake and some house made mint ice cream with chocolate flecked throughout.  there were also some chocolate decorations, a loop and a rod that were very good.  last, i was brought 2 mignardises.  one was a watermelon jelly candy and the other one i think was marshmallow but i may be wrong.\n\nhuge thanks to a great serving crew--michael, my server, a young woman who was a busser in my area and had a wonderful personality, and the runners from the kitchen who explained each course beautifully.  it's too bad it wasn't recorded so i got more things correct in this review.\n\nmichael took my credit card as time got short and i left the restaurant about 10 minutes before the start of rod stewart.  they did an outstanding job of moving the courses along and i was in my seat with 5 minutes to spare.\n\ni have to come back in another season when the dishes are different and do the tasting again and take more time to savor each course.  i don't know why i overlooked spago for so long!!", 
            "i had a really hard time choosing between this or emeril lagasse's restaurant delmonico steakhouse in the venetian, so my dad suggested i come here for lunch. after looking at the celebrity figurines at madame tussauds wax museum and my gondola ride inside the venetian, i walked over here for lunch. located deep inside the forums shop of the caesar's palace, i was half an hour early but they sat me right away, they sat me at the bar. \ni asked my waiter if wolfgang was here and he said that he was at his other restaurant chinois in beverly hills (would've been nice to meet the original celebrity chef). i started off with a drink: honey-limeade soda (perfect contrast of sweet and sour), for my appetizer i got the soup of the day: <mark><mark>Heirloom Tomato Soup</mark></mark> topped with a swirl of basil pistou (similar to a pesto except that it lacks pine nuts) and a couple drops of extra virgin olive oil (so fresh). \nfor my entr\\u00e9e i got their: hand cut fettucini with wild oregon mushrooms (chanterelle and beech), english peas, arugula, glazed shallots (they were glazed in balsamic vinegar) and topped with freshly grated parmagiano regggiano (freshly made pasta, buttery peas that pop in your mouth, nutty parmesan, crunch from the glazed shallots and some chew from the mushrooms). i'm glad i listened to my dad when he suggested this to me, such an awesome place for lunch, next time i'll be sure to stop in for dinner !!!", 
            "another disappointing experience at a wolfgang puck restaurant. i went there for lunch with a friend and had the <mark><mark>Heirloom Tomato Soup</mark></mark> and a <mark><mark>Spago Chopped Salad</mark></mark>. the soup was pretty good but a world famous chef should be able to do better than that. the salad was almost inedible. it didn't mention on the menu that it would be covered in dill, which is something i would never order if i had known so i wasn't able to eat much of it and left most of it on my plate to be wasted, which i never do. i know liking or not like dill is a personal preference, but if it had just been listed on the menu i could have easily just ordered it without it. the lettuce was also a cheap iceberg and lots of just the spines which is really tacky and a big peeve of mine. there were very limited vegetarian options on the menu, so i thought this would be safe, but it was an unsatisfying meal to say the least."

            "wasting time in vegas will get you into trouble or find culinary awesomeness. \n\ni ordered a non-alcoholic drink called the raspberry velvet, very un vegas like of me. but oh well. it was a piece of heaven. raspberry puree with lime juice and seltzer. so refreshing!\n\nfor starters i had a small thai <mark><mark>Chinese Chicken Salad</mark></mark> that was a mish-mash of all sorts of itty bitty ingredients including some flowers, it too was fresh tasting, and the chicken was moist as well. very pleased. \n\nthen i had the <mark><mark>Margherita Pizza</mark></mark> to go. it was good, but the dough was a little thicker than what i'm used to, but still really very good. \n\nthen later the same night, i had a big dinner with 10 from work. it was a great evening. the staff was really great, they helped out with one gluten free eater. this waiter was on his game. he was really truly wonderful and the meals were really very good. \n\nthe top dishes were the red snapper, the pizzas, the braised short ribs with homemade gnocchi, and the desserts were pretty good too. the earl grey ice cream knocked me off my feet. i could have eaten that all day. i've made things with tea flavors and it can be difficult to achieve a strong flavor. this was gooood stuff.", 
            "oh yeah, love this place!! i will be coming back to this place for sure next time i'm in lv. \ni was having intense cravings for some gourmet pizza with goat cheese. my boyfriend and i were looking for a place to relax, share a glass of wine and enjoy a nice evening together. \nas i was walking by spagos', i saw the most amazing pizzas and knew this was our spot. our waiter found us a perfect cozy booth and gave us the cafe menu even though we were sitting in the restaurant area. the staff really went above and beyond. \ndinner started off with the most delcious bread medley -- parmesan , raisin bread, focaccia, rye. the best! we split the <mark><mark>Margherita Pizza</mark></mark> and the kobe burger. the pizza was best pizza i've probably ever consumed. the cheese blend was out of this world, topped off with the freshest basil, tomatoes and spices. the kobe beef burger was sensational --a delicious melding of juicy beef,applewood bacon and aioli sauce.  \ni must say spago's is my favorite restaurant in vegas so far. if i could find a place just half as good as spago's in my hometown, i'd be there at least every week!!", 
            "we came for lunch & were very impressed!\n\ni ordered the <mark><mark>Margherita Pizza</mark></mark> which was a large portion for one person. it was delicious! my husband ordered the burger which came with a side salad and fries. once again, it was huge & really good; highly recommend! \n\ni thought the prices were very reasonable, especially for vegas. also a great spot for people watching!", 
            "this place is ok. had early dinner with a friend since she wanted to eat @ spago. \n\nshe ordered oysters for appetizer, surprisingly came in a huge bowl for just 3 oysters. i wanted to get straight on to their oven baked thin crust pizza. i ordered my favorite <mark><mark>Margherita Pizza</mark></mark> thinking as long as they make a decent <mark><mark>Margherita Pizza</mark></mark>, they are good in my book.....well it was o-k. pretty decent size so i was only able to finish half of it, but as far as taste goes, it was good, but not memorable enough for me to go back. \n\nnot sure if you can call it an upscale dining experience since i was in my shirt and shorts being a tourist and stopped by after hours of shopping at the forum. location wise it doesn't stand out as an upscale restaurant.\n\ni also had thai salad. it was good but once again not memorable. \n\nmaybe what i ordered were just o-k but there could be other items on the menu that are great. oh yeah, the bread basket was good. better than many other restaurants as others mentioned.\n\nmy friend is the one who wanted to eat here but she didn't like her oysters, and she gave this place a 2.5 stars. to me this place is a 3.", 
            "walking around caesars palace not really having any idea where to eat, also with a few \"free\" drinks in me already and one in my hand, we decided spago looked pretty good from outside and the prices were reasonable enough, considering how much everything costs in vegas.\n\ni don't think i'd ever been to a \"wolfgang puck\" restaurant before, and i'm generally pretty cynical about anyone putting his name on multiple places in big tourist stops, but this stuff was good.  we ordered a calamari appetizer and a <mark><mark>Margherita Pizza</mark></mark> to share. both were wonderful, with the calamari coming with a delicious sweet and spicy sauce. \n\nalso they give you an assortment of bread before your meal comes out, and it's not just that wimpy little bread and butter crap. this was some fancy shiz. there were three different types with their own sauces, including sweet bread, with raisins or cranberry baked into it and topped with butter. also a different type topped with olive oil, etc. good stuff.\n\nthe pizza was delicious as well, with nice sharp cheeses and plenty to go around. the crust wasn't amazing but i was far from complaining.\n\nsomehow we managed to get out of here for $35 bucks. \n\ni would give 5 stars but didnt' try enough of the dishes, and like i said the pizza wasn't exactly perfect, but seriously i doubt you could do much better at caesars for the price.  had a giftcard to another wolfgang puck restaurant the following day (we didn't mean to go to two of his places, but that's how it worked out), and it wasn't nearly as good and cost twice as much.", 
            "20 feb 2012 | 4:00 pm-ish.\n\nlet me preface this review with a positive statement. spago's server assistants are top notch. ok, on to the rest. \n\nwish i could keep my review at around 5 stars, but here's the thing:\n1. the <mark><mark>Margherita Pizza</mark></mark> that my lady friends ordered didn't come with any basil! for some reason, i totally tuned out what they were eating, until i took a bite of the last piece of their pizza. yes, to a server, this sounds like a typical, \"we ate the whole thing, but didn't notice until the last piece\" - rip-the-waiter-off scenario. but sadly, it actually happened that way. when i brought it up to our server tony, and told him that the ladies had been too nice to bring it up, he gave me the \"you're trying to rip us off punk\" look, and said, i'll bring it up with the manager. when the bill came, nothing had happened, no apologies, nothing. we paid for a bland cheese pizza with tomatoes on it! hey tony, next time, just err on the side of trust and take off the damn pizza from the check that my friends had to endure...bless their hearts. as a server at at a fine dining restaurant, you are responsible for making sure every ingredient is on the dish before it hits the table. i'm sure t is a great guy, but management, i don't want him as my server next time. thank you. :) (i'm still trying to forgive myself for choosing to pay for it...)\n\n2. the last time i had the pancetta wrapped meat loaf, it had more beef and less of whatever they put in it this time. this time it was essentially a sausage loaf. the gravy and sauces were a bit off this time. i think the gravy turned out to be more of a watered down version of salsa verde, and the port wine sauce kind of got lost in the mix. the redeeming value of the dish? the potato/sweet potato puree and spinach. soooooo good. \n\n3. the crispy calamari was just that. crispy breading and tasty rings of squid. but all of us agreed that the marinated cucumbers and hearts of palm with coriander vinaigrette was the highlight of the dish. \n\nin the end, my recommendation is sit at the bar, your service will be phenomenal. \n\nps: is it not a requirement in vegas anymore that servers have to have a nametag? i had to specifically ask tony his name when he came to the table. no nametag...", 
            "the food was awesome here!  my boyfriend and i split the <mark><mark>Margherita Pizza</mark></mark> and iceberg <mark><mark>Little Gem Lettuce 'Caesar' Salad</mark></mark> (forget the name), both were really good.  the others in our party ordered other pizzas and entrees and everyone enjoyed the food!\n\nservice was great.  we had a party of 9 at around 2pm, the place was packed but our server was very attentive with refilling water and more orders of mimosas.", 
            "i enjoyed my meal at spago, but wasn't as impressed as my companions. the wedge salad is good but not notable, however the heirloom tomato and burrata salad special was outstanding - the best overall dish of the night.  \n\nwe ended up splitting 3 pizzas - i have to say, i found the crust to be disappointing on all of them. not much flavor at all - more of just a vehicle for the toppings.  as for the specific pies:\n-margherita - crust was a bit undercooked, and overall i would call this a pretty average <mark><mark>Margherita Pizza</mark></mark>\n-proscuitto - this was the best of the 3 - the proscuitto and fromage blanc worked perfectly together.  with a great crust this pizza would have mind blowing potential.\n-lamb chorizo - a very nice pie overall - enjoyed the chorizo, and the toppings all worked well together. \n\nservice was excellent.",

            "i have dined here before and always had a great experience so i decided to have dinner here on my birthday. it started out ok ,i was seated right away and shortly after i was greeted by josh(i think that was his name). he brought water(which he kept filled at all times) and he brought bread and butter, i remember other times having choices of bread and different kinds of olive oil. oh well, then my server comes(nicole) with attitude. i ordered the <mark><mark>Margherita Pizza</mark></mark> that was recommended on yelp, not that great. i was hoping to have the short ribs that were also recommended on yelp, not on the menu. now what am i going to have? nothing else really sounded that great. miss attitude offered a special for the evening which was <mark><mark>California Sea Bass</mark></mark>, i like fish so that's what i ordered. it wasn't that busy so i'm not sure why it took so long for my food to come out, luckily josh kept me entertained. the <mark><mark>California Sea Bass</mark></mark> was good, small but good. time for dessert, i love peaches so i was happy to see a fresh peach crisp on the menu. i was a little concerned until it came out because she kept calling it cobbler, i didn't want a cobbler i wanted a crisp. it was soooo tart. it didn't look right and it didn't taste right. now she comes with the check, wow $38 for that <mark><mark>California Sea Bass</mark></mark>. it was good but wow. with tip $100 for my birthday meal, not sure it was worth it.(dinner for 1) i will try them again but will check the menu before dining and hope for a server that doesn't have attitude.", 
            "i sampled a variety of dishes here during lunch, including their <mark><mark>Margherita Pizza</mark></mark>, mushroom fettuccine, the fried calamari, and their prime rib sandwich. the food was average. nothing too special or too different from the many restaurants in vegas that serve casual but higher-end lunch options. i think there are better pizzas (secret pizza), pasta (olives), appetizers, and sandwiches around. it's not that the food here is not good; it's just not as good as others'. service was average and our party of 7 was able to sit down right away on a saturday afternoon.", 
            "we enjoyed a great lunch at spago. the <mark><mark>Margherita Pizza</mark></mark> was outstanding and i even tried a bite of aaron's <mark><mark>Pepperoni Pizza</mark></mark>, which was also incredible. the oysters we had for our appetizer were great and the mignonette that accompanied them was wonderful as well. we ended our lunch with the peanut butter souffle which was deliciously sweet and just the right amount of peanut buttery goodness. \n\noverall: spago offers a great lunch and is definitely worth visiting. next time im in town i look forward to trying out their dinner as well.", 
            "first let me say that i am a local .  i have frequented spago for lunch many times but today will be my last ! without getting into too much detail , the food was marginal ( i ordered the mussels ... very small in size and overcooked and my fianc\\u00e9e had a <mark><mark>Margherita Pizza</mark></mark> with mushrooms.  seriously , we had to examine the pizza to determine if they actually put any mushrooms on it !  the staff is indifferent ! most people are tourists and will not ever be a regular customer , therefore , they don't have to work for your return business ! here's a tip ! go to wolfgang puck at crystals at city center ! the food and staff and atmosphere are so much better and so much more enjoyable !and if you're a local you will get a 20% discount ! spago is basically a tourists restaurant ! you can do way better ! shop around !",

            "it's amazing reading some of these reviews. i seriously wonder how knowledgeable people are about pizza when they state that the pizza here was \"fantastic.\"  i ate here two days ago and like most people ordering for lunch that day, i had a pizza.  i ordered the <mark><mark>Italian Sausage Pizza</mark></mark> with roaster fennel, tuscan olives, reggiano cheese and thyme.\n\nthis pizza tasted just like pizzas i have had at california pizza kitchen except theirs were better.  my pizza at spago had onions on it- the description on the menu did not say it came with onions.  quite frankly, the combination just did not work.  the onions and olives overpowered the flavor of the sausage, which was pretty tasty once it was off the pizza.  the reggiano cheese also did not work for me.\n\nwhen i am paying over $15 for a pizza, i expect better.  this is the second time i've been disappointed with a wolfgang puck restaurant.  next time i'm in vegas, i'll be sure to skip his restaurants.", 
            "yummy! not only is this the perfect spot to stop for lunch while shopping in the forum shops, but its really great food too. we sat on the more busy \"patio\" that is inside the shops more, and that is the perfect lunch spot. pretty casual, but still fine dining in the \"cafe\" for lunch. \n\nwe split the blt salad, and it was so good. the bacon is not stupid little bits, but big, real pieces! so much better. the dressing was also tasty. we split the <mark><mark>Italian Sausage Pizza</mark></mark> and i really liked the thin crust. the pizza was pretty good, but not the best i've had. the cheese was almost too thick on such a thin crust for my liking. i did like the addition of the olives. \n\nthe service was friendly, the food good, and the location perfect for a day shopping!", 
            "spago offers different areas of seating. patio and dining room. if you enjoy people watching choose the patio. if you prefer conversation friendly, request the dining room. the dining room also offers a choice of booths or tables. both have comfortable seating.  our service was prompt and courteous. \nwe decided to share the <mark><mark>Italian Sausage Pizza</mark></mark>. the dish provides enough for 2 people. the dough is soft and tasty. the sausage is thinly sliced round pieces. overall the pie was delicious. spago is celebrating it's 20th anniversary at the forum shops. that says it all considering there are numerous choices of dining at the forum shops. congratulations to chef puck and his team. here's wishing you many more.", 
            "summary:  spago is a great place to take a significant other.  the noise level in the cafe was not too loud which made it an enjoyable experience.  although unnerving while watching you dine, the wait staff does a great job of answering questions and clearing dishes from the table.  the pizzas are highly recommended but be willing to shell out some money for the drinks, cocktails and wines being the most unreasonably priced.\n\ni went to spago on new year's eve with my girlfriend.  fortunately i made reservations the week before.  our reservation was for 7:15 but i showed up a little early and was seated by 7:05.  there are two menus you can choose from; the cafe menu of the dining room menu.  the dining room menu has your meats and fine dining while the cafe menu has brick oven pizzas ad the like.  we opted for the cafe menu and ordered drinks, an appetizer, and our main meal all at once.  unfortunately they all came out at the same time (very quickly, about 20 minutes after ordering) so our pizzas got cool while we ate our calamari.\n\nthe cafe, although mostly open to the forum shops street mall, was not as loud as you might expect.  conversation was easily audible.  the wait staff was friendly and had no trouble answering any of the questions i had about the menu.  it is a little unnerving however since the wait staff lines along the side wall when they are not helping diners, observing the dining room and seeing if any diners need them.  they just stand there...looking...watching....constantly vigilant.  that aside, they do great at being johnny on the spot for clearing dishes and helping with questing.\n\nthe calamari served with their sweet chili sauce was fantastic.  the chicken <mark><mark>Italian Sausage Pizza</mark></mark> was equally fantastic and was a fairly large portion that i almost did not finish because it made me full.  the drink prices were the most unreasonable and unpleasant thing i encountered at spago.  soda is $4.50 and the cocktails range from $10-17.  i ordered a vesper and it was $16, where a fair price could have been $9 or $10.", 
            "wolfgang puck has done it again! spago is located in the caesar's palace forum shops right next to la perla and closer to the casino end. semi casual and upscale, my sister, brother in law, and i came here for lunch on christmas day. we were seated quickly at around 12 without a need for a reservation.\n\nservice here is great- our server was attentive and our water cups were never empty. at first look this restaurant looks pretty small but once you go inside, you will realize that they actually have two levels and a relatively large bar. although the rest of the restaurant looked nice, the restroom looked like it could use some upkeep and was on the dirtier, messier side.\n\nwe ordered the sliders as an appetizer, a chicken <mark><mark>Italian Sausage Pizza</mark></mark> for my brother in law, an <mark><mark>Italian Sausage Pizza</mark></mark> for myself, and a chicken sandwich for my sister. the best item here on the menu is the sliders. delicious, melt in your mouth, and delectable sliders. i would've eaten those as the main entree if i could.\n\none star down for the rest of the food. definitely not bad, but definitely not \"as worth\" coming back for as the sliders. the chicken sandwich breast tasted dry, and neither of the pizzas were memorable. for the three of us with tip, the meal came out to around $90.", 
            "all the restaurants at caesar's were full for dinner, so we ventured into the forum shops and stumbled on spago. having eaten there before for lunch, we decided to try  it for dinner. after looking at the menu, we decided to share most courses, starting with calimari, then a caesar salad, and finally, the <mark><mark>Italian Sausage Pizza</mark></mark> and a bowl of gnocci.\n\nthe food was good; my only complaint about the food that that the gnocci was $21 and the portion was small. \n\nthe reason for my 3-star rating was the service. saying it was \"attentive\" would be an understatement. i like attentive service just as much as the next person, but the waitress and her assistants acted like they were in a keystone cops' movie where all of the action is accelerated. i no sooner put down my fork then the next course came and had not finished my glass of wine before the bus person whisked it off the table. it was very obvious she wanted to turn the table for the next diners, but honestly, for a check that totaled $95 before tip, spago should let its diners relax a bit. \n\non the way out, i mentioned the problem to the hostess who offered to get the manager. i suppose i should have let her, but we had already paid the bill and were on our way out.  we may be back, but only if we could eat at the bar.", 
            "came here for lunch last sunday with a reservation just because it is a smaller location. it was alright but for the pricing, it wasn't anything crazy good. unless you're coming here for pizza, i'd rather go to mesa grill or cheesecake factory. also one thing i really hated, was the fact that it wasn't too busy but everything took forever! a quick lunch ended up being 2 1/2 hours! we would have ordered dessert but we didn't want to wait another 30 minutes for that.\nfor appetizer we had the prime beef sliders. the flavor was really delicious and the beef was really tender but oh my goodness, these are the smallest sliders i've had in my life. their height was the length of my thumb and was as big around as a silver dollar. also, their baby portion of fries was good but again, the portion was hilarious. i think these were about $16? not worth it.\nmy boyfriend had the chicken <mark><mark>Italian Sausage Pizza</mark></mark> and sure the portion was great but that's because it's a pizza. the flavor was good, but you could get the same at settebello or cpk. they also served it with pasilla peppers on top.\ni had the atlantic salmon. salmon was cooked perfectly but their pairing with the curried califlower didn't match in my opinion. nothing memorable for this dish either and i believe the pricing was about $28.\nhonestly, if everything had been about $5 cheaper, they would maybe get 4 stars because nothing was really wrong with anything we ate but everything we tried, we could get somewhere else with better flavor, more reasonable pricing, and it wouldn't have taken 2 1/2 hours. sorry spago, this one was a miss for me. i would defintiely recommend bobby flay's mesa grill for a lunch option at caesar's instead.", 
            "i came here for a quick lunch with my family before we left to drive back to la. after doing a little last minute shopping in caesar's we got hungry and decided to try spago. we all shared the chicken <mark><mark>Italian Sausage Pizza</mark></mark>, their handcut fettuccini with shrimp, a burger, and a plate of their calamari. the prices here were actually pretty decent for vegas, as were the portion sizes. the pizza was very warm and crispy, but a bit too thin for my liking, as i usually prefer pizzas that are thicker and heavier. i think my favorite dishes of our meal had to be the fettuccini and calamari. the calamari was breaded nicely and chewy like how calamari should be. however, the crowd favorite was definitely the handcut fettuccini. the fettuccini came with 3 fresh pieces of <mark><mark>Chilled Jumbo Shrimp</mark></mark> served on top a nice warm bed of noodle-like pasta. i say \"noodle-like\" because unlike most pastas, spago's fettuccini had a texture that was more like the texture of asian egg noodles.\n\nthe only complaint i had was that in contrary to the what others mentioned in their reviews, my family was not at all offered bread and had to ask both our waiter, and the woman who seemed to be the head waitress, twice for a plate of bread. not only that, but they didn't serve the bread to us until the rest of our food was out as well.", 
            "stopped in for lunch saturday around 3 pm - it was jammed packed up front (where we were seated).\n\nit took awhile to get our drinks and we never received any bread.\n\ni ordered the chicken <mark><mark>Italian Sausage Pizza</mark></mark> and gnoochi, my date a pear and apple salad.\n\nthe pizza was ok, the gnoochi serving was small, and without bread, not filling. it wasn't creamy/rich enough for my liking, but would have made a perfect appetizer. \n\nthe pear and apple salad was very good! great combination of flavors! \n\nour waiter was pre-occupied with another table, and didn't take care of us well. \n\nprobably wouldn't go back but the food was ok."

            "i came here with some friends, including brian m. and ordered the paella like he did, just with the chorizo.  he mentioned in his review that we both agreed that it was better without the chorizo, and i still stand by that.  i just wanted to reiterate that it was better without it. haha.\n\nanyways, i loved the onion foccacia bread, and the goat cheese spread was good at complimenting the 4 breads they had to offer.   we tried the chicken lollipops.  those were actually pretty good. although the drumsticks were really really tiny.\n\nwinston m. tried the <mark><mark>Pepperoni Pizza</mark></mark>, because the waitress had mentioned that wolfgang puck was more known for his pizza's, and i remember him fully enjoying it.  i had another friend try out the kobe beef burger.  it tasted pretty good, although i probably wouldn't have gotten it well done like my friend.  well done to me takes out the juices and flavors.\n\ni'd definitely come here again, but since it is pretty pricey, well, i'd say it was pretty damn worth it.", 
            "after a long day of shopping and walking, spago was an impulsive yet unregrettable choice for  our lunch time meal.\n\nwe immediately sat down and was served a bread basket with a variety of bread and dipping sauces. the bread was filling, crispy and fresh. i loved the texture of the focaccia bread with the smoothness of the olive oil and the kick of the sea salt - simple yet delightful.\n\nfor my main meal i ordered the lamb chorizo wood-fire pizza with goat cheese. it was like a <mark><mark>Pepperoni Pizza</mark></mark>, remixed gourmet style! gobs of goat cheese on a fresh tomato base, with a smattering of the lamb chorizo slices. warm, gooey and tangy - everything a decent pizza should be. the crust had that burnt, smoky texture that's indicative of the wood fire stove. it was soft, with a nice bite to it. would i order it again? absolutely.  i honestly cannot wait to come here again and sample more of wolfgang's cuisine. \n\n:) = happiness!!",

            "went here for a friend's birthday dinner\n\npros - totally awesome decor and ambiance.  loved the feel of the place.  the food was phenomenal, at least the food i ate.  i ordered this apple, fennel salad that came with prosciutto, mozzarella and goat cheeses and lightly drizzled with some sort of vinegarette (*spelling) sauce.  i was impressed with the presentation and, of course, with the taste.   portion-wise it was perfect for me!  i ate it all and left satisfied; i did not feel bloated or full. \n\nhowever, my friend, the birthday boy, didn't stomach the <mark><mark>Pepperoni Pizza</mark></mark> and had some complications the next day.  so i guess... don't order the pizza.   my husband got the pasta bolognese - i had several bites and it was just as spectacular as the pizza.  \n\ncons - floor was waxed too much... and the bathroom is on the second floor.  so if you have to use the restroom, don't hold it in too long.  also,  i saw three women on different occasions walk down the slick steps from the bathroom and they ate it hard, especially with those heels they were rocking!  anyway, they should consider putting in non-slip pads on the floor if they are gonna shine the floors like that.  \n\noverall - what matters is the food and it's sooo worth every penny!\n\nps set a reservation, it helps!",

            "let's go back to 2007.  i just got out of finishing school and i wasn't really much a foodie then and yelp wasn't even on my mind.  well that was also the last time i visited spago.  it was for lunch on their \"outdoor\" patio cafe.  to me, at the time, that was one of the most lavish lunches i ever had but it didn't really wow me.  i always thought i'd always go back to visit spago, but i'm almost surprised that it took me 7 years to finally go back.\n\nit was just my luck that spago was celebrating their 22nd anniversary the week when i was visiting vegas (http://bit.ly/1z636wc).  for the occasion, they were offering the same original dining room menu with same pricing when first opened (http://bit.ly/1v1cw0p).  i knew i was in for something special since i've never dined inside the main dining room before.\n\ni decided on starting with their chopped vegetable salad, the famous <mark><mark>House Smoked Salmon Pizza</mark></mark> (sans caviar) for my appetizer, and wolfgang's beef goulash for my main course.\n\nchopped vegetable salad --  http://bit.ly/1v1d8x4\nw/ balsamic vinaigrette and parmesan\nthis was a good salad to start with.  well plated, and had a lot of different textures and flavor.  \n\n<mark><mark>House Smoked Salmon Pizza</mark></mark> --  http://bit.ly/1z6t4ju\nw/ dill creme fraiche & chives\ni know this is supposed to be their signature pizza, but to me it was just one oversized lox bagel.  maybe it would've been more better with the caviar which could be added for $10 more.  it was still good, but i should've listened to my server as she advised that this was really meant as shared plate and not for one.  i was already getting full after eating half the pizza, plus i still had my beef goulash on the way.  i had the other half boxed up and luckily the nice couple sitting next to me were fans of the pizza, so i gave it to them to take home and enjoy.\n\nwolfgang's beef goulash --  http://bit.ly/1z6t9ws\nw/ sauteed spatzle, parsley, marjoram, creme fraiche\nomfgyum!  this beef goulash was so good!!  i'm so glad i didn't finish that pizza because i probably wouldn't have enjoyed it as much.  the beef was so tender that you really didn't need knife to cut into it.  it just broke off like butter with my fork  and it was packed with flavor!  i would definitely come back to have this again if they bring it back on their menu.\n\nafter all that, i was really too full for dessert.  no matter though, overall it was a very solid dining experience.  and with the retro pricing, it was a great deal!  it definitely feels like i've come full circle with spago, now that i got to experience the dining room side to realize what the big fuss was that i missed back in 2007.  i will definitely come back and a lot sooner than 7 years.", 
            "me and my wife never leave vegas without a meal from spago. the food and service is always impeccable. ambience is great whether you dine in the cafe or main dining room. duck breast and the red wine braised spare ribs are amazing. the steak sandwich at the cafe is on point. always order the <mark><mark>House Smoked Salmon Pizza</mark></mark> it will be one of the best things you will ever eat.",

            "so wonderful to revisit the fabulous spago in ceasar's forum shops.    we had a bottle of the wolfgang puck cabernet sauvignon, wow great wine.  we asked for the <mark><mark>House Smoked Salmon Pizza</mark></mark>, which apparently only customers my age knows about and they did not disappoint!   the flour spago's uses for pizza is so unique, light, airy but still chewy.  then cr\\u00e8me fraiche and layers of delicious salmon!  the best!   \n\nto top off the night we met the engaging and charismatic roberto.  what a great asset for spago's!  roberto is an seasoned restaurant and nightclub veteran who still is passionate about the business, very rare.   he made our entire evening!  regaling us with stories about restaurants and history, we couldn't have asked for more!   thank you spagos"

(puh-lease. i don't have friends. what were you thinking?)\n\nthe complementary bread basket was admittedly a very good bread basket. three types of bread peeked out of the bread cone and were served alongside of olive oil, butter, and sea salt. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/lwqb9h3jz9wtk24lr-anzq?select=jzoe75g5z7xcj_j3bzffow\n\nthe calamari was served with a side bed of marinated cucumbers and hearts of palm in coriander vinaigrette and with garlic aioli and sweet chili dipping sauces. the skin wasn't too thick, but it didn't taste like anything special. the garlic aioli wasn't really my style, but at least the sweet chili dipping sauce was good. (although it could have used more kick to it as there was virtually none.) i did enjoy the marinated cucumbers and hearts of palm on the side, but it wasn't enough to really wow me. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/lwqb9h3jz9wtk24lr-anzq?select=broyhh3fuqge-ssgkp1viw\n\nthe unagi glazed scottish <mark><mark>Teriyaki Glazed Salmon Salad</mark></mark> over romaine lettuce, daikon radish, shiso, avocado, celeric remoulade, steamed jasmine rice, and japanese vinaigrette was probably my favorite dish. really! if this had been all that i had tasted, it would have been a 4 or 5 star review. it was light, had a good variety of flavor in each bite, and the tastes melded together beautifully. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/lwqb9h3jz9wtk24lr-anzq?select=pcrnnrnrlyaafukw8zr_mg\n\nthe disappointment of the afternoon (other than not eating at my first choice, mesa grill) was the wood fired mushroom pizza. it was covered with roasted portabella mushrooms, caramelized white onions, italian parsley, and parmesan cheese. the mushroom flavor was strictly confined to the bites with mushroom directly on it, which i understand, but i expected the flavor to extend beyond just a little bit. maybe it was having the parmesan cheese melted as the one and only cheese, but it just wasn't my style. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/lwqb9h3jz9wtk24lr-anzq?select=sx7d_nf9jynqxqdilfchba\n\noverall, i wasn't impressed. the prices were pretty reasonable, especially given the location in the middle of caesar's forum shops. i'd suggest that you specifically read other reviews for the dishes - maybe my family just ordered the \"wrong\" ones.",

            "it's like marnee thai in san francisco or fantastic cafe in long beach or mastro's ocean club in laguna beach or le diplomat in irvine. \nwhen i think of las vegas, i think of spago and vice versa. we make it a point to eat here each time we go to vegas, whether we win or lose, stay at the flamingo, planet hollywood, bellagio or caesars. we have to. and the best part is that the menu is ever-evolving. \n\nduring our last visit we had \n1. oven roasted day boat alaskan halibut\n2. grilled virginian line caught striped bass\n3. creme brulee \n4. peach tea\n\nfor our most recent visit, it was just as good. we had:\n1. mediterranean <mark><mark>California Sea Bass</mark></mark>\n2. california roll\n3. stir fried shanghai style egg noodles.\n\ni loved my alaskan halibut my last visit so i asked the waiter what was similar to it and he pointed me to the mediterranean <mark><mark>California Sea Bass</mark></mark>. it was not as soft/flaky as chilean <mark><mark>California Sea Bass</mark></mark>, but still good. it was served over a celery apple puree with celery hearts and huckleberry. it gave it an interesting, almost sweet flavor, but not what you would expect when hearing \"apple\" and i love how they prepare it in such a unique way that i know i won't likely find a dish like it anywhere else. \n\nthe california roll was excellent as well - nothing like any of the other california rolls i've tasted - for this, the authentic crab meat was marinated in a lemon vinaigrette. \n\nmy wife was quite pleased with her noodles, but was a little disappointed that it contained pork. after picking those pieces out though, it was delicious but a bit on the spicy side. \n\nwhat i failed to mention in my last review was the bread. we always look forward to it. a waiter comes by with a basket of four different kinds and a dish with butter, pepper, olive oil and salt. if you go, definitely try the cherry walnut bread - so good and just the right amount of sweet. the honey focaccia was tasty as well.  \n\neach time i go there, i'm confident that whatever the chef puts on the menu is delicious. i'll continue going here as long as it's around and like i said before, if i could give it six or seven stars, i would. my all time favorite fancy restaurant.",

            "spago by wolfgang puck, his signature restaurant in las vegas\n\nthe decor is modern with warm oranges and red color schemes.  the restaurant is expansive, with a second floor, a bar area and an \"outdoor\" seating area so you can people watch as shoppers walk by.  we were seated on the first floor in a little raised area where we were the first diners of the night to sit there yet still had amazing service.\n\nwolfgang puck is known for his amazing modern american cuisine and as a treat for ourselves, we went for the chef's tasting menu.  officially 6 courses, we ended up with what seemed to be 8 courses.  for $95, you get a lot of food while you could end up paying somewhere in the $30s for an entree.  chef eric klein did not disappoint with small portions of his most popular menu items for tasting with some items that weren't available for order on any menu at spago, lunch or dinner.   \n\nbread: as many reviewers have noted, spago's bread platter is well known for very good reason.  with four choices that night, sourdough, cranberry walnut, flat bread and foccacia, you could not go wrong with any.  dipping platter:  olive oil infused with rosemary, salt, pepper and butter.  the bread was very good as advertised, something that i tried to pace myself with knowing that i had the tasting menu to come.\n\namuse bouche: duo of american kobe beef \"sliders\" brioche buns, bread-butter pickles, red onions, smoked gouda, house made ketchup, chilled maryland blue crab salad fragrant herbs, avocado, grapefruit segments, lemon vinaigrette and basil pistou\n-melt in your mouth kobe beef, a perfect bite with the pickles providing just enough tang but the crab salad was what stole the show.  the grapefruit and lemon vinaigrette was unbeatable in cutting through the richness of the crab salad.  amazing bite\n\nfirst course: margarita flambe: mozzarella, fontina, parmesan, goat cheese with garden tomatoes and basil\n-crispy and flaky crust with an intense tomato flavor.  the flambe was good, something that didn't stand out too much at the end of the dinner, great contrast between the crust and the flavor of the toppings\n\nsecond course: duo of yellowfin <mark>Big-Eye Tuna Tartare & Sashimi</mark>: watercress salad, lychee, chive and aji limon and avocado, daikon radish, scallion and yuzu-wasabi\n-served in a perfect ice sculpture, the presentation was dramatic.  each sashimi bite had incredibly fresh seafood, the tuna being highlighted by the lychee and  by the yuzu, very yummy flavorful punches\n\nthird course: soup/salad: farmers' market cauliflower soup\ntrumpet royale mushrooms, arugula and basil oil olsen farm's baby arugula salad farmers' market apple, shaved fennel, burrata cheese, prosciutto san daniele, ice wine vinegar and olive oil\n-the soup was very creamy, had hints of potato but was made with pureed cauliflower, the arugula and basil oil was a great way to cut through the creaminess, very yummy with a great balanced salad.  the apple, fennel and cheese were complimented by the ice wine.  overall, great course\n\nfourth course: hand rolled, ricotta gnocchi with porrcini mushrooms, black truffle butter, cheese foam,\nthe best course of the night! there is no way to describe the pillowy, fluffy gnocchi, this course is not available anywhere on the menu day or night, it can only be had through the tasting menu.  the heartiness of the mushrooms with the black truffle butter, was insanely delicious, i could eat this dish every day for a long time\n\nfifth course: grilled french <mark><mark>California Sea Bass</mark></mark> loup de mer: artichokes, baby carrots, haricot vert, cipollini, arugula, fennel pur\\u00e9e, artichokes barigoule broth au pistou\n-perfectly cooked fish, flaky with a crispy crust.  the broth was something that could've been drunk without any accompaniment, very tasty and the accompanying vegetables were great for the fish.\n\nsixth course: mesquite grilled prime filet mignon: sweet & sour red onions, celery, watercress, bone marrow crushed <mark><mark>Tuscan Fingerling Potatoes</mark></mark> and armagnac peppercorn sauce pistachio crusted colorado lamb chops\ncheese on top of the lamb, pickled beets and onions with balsamic reduction\n-the lamb was tender, with the peppercorn flavor coming right through and the filet mignon was tender and tasty.  after all the big bold flavors in the past courses, the meat course was a little lacking but still very tasty if i had just had that course.  i was still hooked on that gnocchi.\n\npalate cleanser: blood orange and passionfruit sorbet over blueberries\n-yummy sorbet that had a touch of bitterness that did its job, cleanse your palate after that long meal.  i ate the whole thing, def not just a palate cleanser\n\ndesert: crepe: dark chocolate, hazelnut, creme fraiche with orange glaze\n-great crepe, with just enough body in the crepe to balance the hazelnute and dark chocolate\n\noverall, great attentive service, great food, was greeted by eric klein himself, would do it again in a heartbeat if i had unlimited funds, well worth the money",

            "what really hasn't been said about spago both good and bad.  i can add a few tidbits that might help a brother out but that's about it.\n\nextremely amazing service.  everybody was very attentive and accommodating.  we brought our little boy here because we were invited by a good friend and some of his coworkers since we were all at the same conference that weekend. very thoughtful of them.  anyway, the staff was extra attentive to our son and really took the time to attend to his needs even though it was really hopping that night.  \n\nfor example, when he was a little fussy and i had to take him outside to walk around a bit, they gladly kept my food under a warmer for the few minutes that i was outside.  \n\nthe food was amazing as expected.  i will reel off a quick list of what we had.\n\niced <mark><mark>Three Oysters on the Half Shell</mark></mark>  with ginger-rhubarb mignonette - fresh and tasty like the sea.   i believe they were kumamoto oysters.\n\nwild pacific blue shrimp - no preservatives here.  fresh fresh fresh.\n\nsymphony of tuna - can't explain all the ways but yum, yum, yum.  \n\nchilled maryland blue crab salad - a spoonful of goodness. a bit of avocado, grapefruit segments and a lemon vinaigrette along with the crab served in a ramen type soup spoon.  wow.\n\ngrilled french <mark><mark>California Sea Bass</mark></mark> loup de mer - crispy skin and cooked perfectly.  the mousseline was nice.\n\npan roasted bone-in veal costoletta - sorry veal haters :(  this was very well cooked and despite being under the heat lamp for longer than the chef would have liked i'm sure (read above) it still was cooked very well and was tender as can be.  the risotto was oh so savory.\n\nfrom the words of my party, the salmon was the best that they have ever had, the halibut was so good that it resulted in a clean plate, and the filet was just ridiculous and served with the wgp signature bone marrow.\n\ni love good food and wgp never disappoints.  many thanks to our good friends for a great meal and next meal is on us.", 
            "i've never been to a wolfgang puck restaurant or cafe that i didn't like... and spago was no exception!\n\nthe service was superb, the food was delicious, and the atmosphere was elegant in the dining room. my mom kept commenting on how there were more waiters then customers for a saturday night, but we did originally get there around 5:45pm and the dining room eventually filled up and was almost full when we left two hours later (we ate leisurely and had coffee with dessert after our entrees).\n\nbefore our entrees came out, we were given a plate of olive oil, sea salt, pepper, and butter for some artisan breads that were served by a waiter (whose only job it seemed was to serve bread). the selection was quite diverse with an onion foccacia, an herb & cheese lavash, sourdough, cherry walnut bread, and pretzel bread. i tried one of everything and would have eaten more if i didn't know were were going to get our appetizer and entrees soon.\n\nspeaking of entrees, i ordered the new england diver sea scallops with three giant scallops that were perfectly cooked. it was topped with a mascarpone foam that was pretty to look at and fun on the plate, but had little taste. however, the flavors of the rest of the dish definitely made up for that. my brother had a taste and mentioned that he would have eaten 10 of those scallops instead of his entree. the appetizer we ordered was a special one not on the menu, and i am so happy with our choice. we got persimmon and prosciutto flatbread with fromage blanc... it was heaven. i don't know how they made the crust so light, crisp, and airy, but i would go back just for that.\n\nmy brother ordered the choucroute garnie royal that comes with mustard, sauerkraut, blood sausage, regular sausage, chicken sausage, and pork belly. he couldn't stomach the blood sausage (and neither could i) but the rest of the sausages were decent. edible, but not amazing. my brother wishes he would have tried the duck... i do too because it sounded great on the menu!\n\nmy mom ordered the grilled french <mark><mark>California Sea Bass</mark></mark> loup de mer, and it was amazing! the portion was very generous and the grilled onions and artichoke under the fish itself complemented very well with the dish. she loved her dish so much, she didn't even want to try any of our food.\n\nmy dad ordered the chilled maryland blue crab salad because he was still semi full from an earlier meal. i'm so glad he was full because he would have ordered chicken or steak and we would have missed out on this yummy dish! each bite of crab, avocado, and grapefruit was like a party in my mouth. the flavor combo is not one i would have ever put together, but it was on point!\n\nfor dessert, we had the chocolate souffle with ice cream. the ice cream was delicious, but the souffle was not my favorite.\n\noh, i almost forgot... the best part about the dining experience at spago was the little things they did to set them apart from other restaurants. first, my glass of water was never half filled, it was always full. second, they gave us complimentary parsnip soup with truffle oil. third, around the time the bill came, the waiter produced a mini plate of chocolate petit fours.", 
            "a week ago we celebrated a birthday for my dear friend from nyc.  it was my idea for her to spend her birthday wkend in this infamous sin city, but it was our mutual friend from santa monica that hooked us up with a fabulous dining experience here at spago.\nso i admit, this review may be a bit skewed since our party of 6 received vip treatment... our friend knows the executive chef, eric klein and his wife. we were greeted by both of them, which was pretty cool. \n\nthe front of the restaurant has a more casual vibe with the open pseudo-patio facing the forum shops. we were led to the back of the restaurant which was the fine dining area. i immediately noticed sinatra playing in the background, which i love. we basically had a phenomenal 5 or more tastings prior to our chosen individual main entree.  the sommelier suggested an amazing red wine from santa rita hills: gypsy canyon... and i thought i was done with pinot noirs, but this wine was atypical for a pinot noir. it wasn't light, but more medium body and fruit forward. it paired beautifully with everything we ate. so i can't recall the order of what was presented to us... <mark>Big-Eye Tuna Tartare & Sashimi</mark>, amazingly fresh scallop, flavorful fennel soup... i admit i should have written this last week, because i can't recall each & every dish.  my main entree that i chose was the grilled french <mark><mark>California Sea Bass</mark></mark> which was absolutely delicious!  and dessert was decadent influences of chocolate... each of the 3 or 4 types of pastry was out of control... sinfully scrumptious!\n\nwe were definitely spoiled with exceptional delectable dishes and outstanding service.", 
            "was in vegas for my bachelorette party and wanted to have a nice dinner with the girls so we decided to go to spago.\n\ni love wolfgang puck so i was very excited to come to his restaurant.  we started with some bacon cheddar bread.  yum! then, the chef sent over some cauliflower soup, which has inspired me to look up recipes on cauliflower soup.  i need to make some since it was so good!\n\nthere were 6 of us and we all ordered different things so we got a really good taste of the menu.  we got the colorado lamb chops (just okay), grilled french <mark><mark>California Sea Bass</mark></mark> (delicious), steamed scottish salmon (good), a special of mushroom risotto (super rich and yummy), the diver scallops (one of my favorite dishes of the night, but only came with 3 scallops), and the braised beef short ribs (this was amazing and a very large portion).  \n\nthe service was great and we had a great time eating delicious food and drinking good wine.  so fun!! i'd love to come back again with my fiance and do the tasting menu!", 
            "i've always wanted to try the vegas spot which started the whole celebrity chef craze and the 20th anniversary throw-back menu was the perfect excuse!\n\nfirst on that night you couldn't beat the prices, we ordered two of the <mark><mark>House Smoked Salmon Pizza</mark></mark> for the tables, entrees and dessert.  if the prices were always this low i'd give it 5-stars easily!\n\ni didn't see anything which jumped out on the menu so i asked the waiter who recommended the <mark><mark>California Sea Bass</mark></mark>.  i'm normally not the type of person to order seafood unless i'm at a strictly seafood place but i decided to trust the server.\n\nthe <mark><mark>California Sea Bass</mark></mark> was really good, crispy and cooked to perfection.  i was very satisfied with my decision and it's given me a little more faith to try something new on a menu!  the <mark><mark>House Smoked Salmon Pizza</mark></mark> i could tell was very fresh, underneath was a sort of tarter sauce which i could have done without.  i'm not a huge salmon fan so i'm surprised i ate 2 slices.\n\nfor dessert i had the souffle which i think is one of the over the top presentations for a dessert.  i've had this before at the former mgm grand detroit location so i knew what to expect, but it was still amazing as always.\n\nservice was really good, i guess when i give a 5-star rating though it's for places which i constantly think about going back to and this one just doesn't come to my head.  no doubt i'd go back though!", 
            "their 6 course tasting menu exceeded my expectations. we got here a little before 6 pm and service was excellent. the bread options were delicious, especially the bacon cheddar biscuit and the parmesan crunchy bread. the tasting menu started off with: \n\n1) tuna done three ways as sashimi, in a cone, and flatbread with home made ricotta cheese\n2) corn soup with burrata salad that was a refreshing appetizer \n3) truffle oil pasta with shaved truffle and foam (our favorite! a euphoric blend of flavors)\n4) avocado, crab and grapefruit which was a refreshing palate cleanser \n5) <mark><mark>California Sea Bass</mark></mark> with tomato broth\n6) seared duck with a crunchy exterior and medium rare. \npalate cleanser: we finished off with a mango sorbet with granita. \n7) dessert was raspberry sorbet with custard, foam\n8) chef's sample of truffle and passionfruit marshmallow.\n\nthroughout dinner, the service was attentive, and multiple waiters asked us how we were doing. the chef came out multiple times to check up on how our meal went. overall, an impressive tasting menu. highly recommend this place!", 
            "i went to spago last night before the rod stewart concert and it was superb in every way, the room, the food, and the service!  i asked about the 6 course tasting menu and my server described the courses.  when he knew i had a show at 7:30, he thought i might not have enough time for the meal.  the he said, \"we'll make it happen.  we'll move things along.\"  the meat course was the only course in which i had a choice.  you could choose either a filet or a lamb chop. \n\nin a few minutes, michael brought a tray with four kinds of bread--cheese dusted lavash, cheddar bacon rolls, mini baguettes, and a cherry walnut bread.  i asked for some lavash and the bacon cheddar roll.  i didn't want to fill up on bread.  note:  with the bread, they serve butter with ground salt on top (hooray!)\n\nthe first course was a seafood course.  there were four compartments on the dish and each one had a small portion of a different fish.  the small spoon had crab, to the right there was some tuna, above on the right was a carpaccio of octopus and to the upper left was albacore tataki.  each had seasonings including an avocado pur\\u00e9e on one, a small piece of melon with another and so on.  great presentation.  wonderful flavors!\n\ncourse 2 was the salad course.  there were two parts to this.  one was a small cup of warm <mark><mark>Heirloom Tomato Soup</mark></mark> that was superb.  i asked michael if it was on the menu, but it's not.  it really was tasty.  along with the soup was a salad consisting of a wedge of yellow and red tomato.  it's been a long time since i had tomatoes with so much flesh and almost no seed.  there were 3 or 4 green beans lying diagonally across the tomatoes and there were some small cherry tomatoes and some more avocado pur\\u00e9e.  very light and lots of summer flavor.\n\ncourse 3 was the first fish course.  a bottom layer had a polenta flan.  on this was the grilled eel and on top of the eel was a fried quail egg.  the dish was decorated with some tasty cheese tuile.  the eel was moist and soft and fell apart with just a touch.  it was perfectly cooked!\n\ncourse 4 was the pasta course.  it consisted of agnolotti that was topped with pieces of lobster meat and there was some basil olive oil drizzled around the base of the pasta.  this was excellent also!\n\ncourse 5 was a second fish course--<mark><mark>California Sea Bass</mark></mark>.  the bass was placed on a layer of what appeared to be thin pasta.  after delving deeper, i found that they were extremely thin, narrow slices of yellow and green squash that could have easily been mistaken for pasta until you tasted them.  very clever execution and very tasty <mark><mark>California Sea Bass</mark></mark>.  there was also a piece of melon and a grilled cherry tomato.  you can see how the chef likes to mix contrasting flavors.\n\ncourse 6 was the meat course and i chose the lamb chop (rare).  it was an herb crusted chop that had been removed from the chop with the bone left there to chew on when the main part was gone. there was some pea pur\\u00e9e and some more basil oil.  it was truly superb!\n\nfor dessert, i first got a plate with three sorbets--blackberry, mango, and raspberry--and there was an extremely thin piece of white chocolate placed in the mango.  it was so delicate it almost melted when i picked it up.  then i was brought a pretty plate with grasshopper cheesecake and some house made mint ice cream with chocolate flecked throughout.  there were also some chocolate decorations, a loop and a rod that were very good.  last, i was brought 2 mignardises.  one was a watermelon jelly candy and the other one i think was marshmallow but i may be wrong.\n\nhuge thanks to a great serving crew--michael, my server, a young woman who was a busser in my area and had a wonderful personality, and the runners from the kitchen who explained each course beautifully.  it's too bad it wasn't recorded so i got more things correct in this review.\n\nmichael took my credit card as time got short and i left the restaurant about 10 minutes before the start of rod stewart.  they did an outstanding job of moving the courses along and i was in my seat with 5 minutes to spare.\n\ni have to come back in another season when the dishes are different and do the tasting again and take more time to savor each course.  i don't know why i overlooked spago for so long!!", 
            "i'm being extremely kind and generous giving this 3 stars. personally, this is a 2 star place all day long, however, the service was excellent, that i'm bumping to 3 star. i came here for a friends birthday party. there were 14 of us and 8 of the group opted for the 6 course meal ($100pp) and the rest of us ordered a la carte. \noddly, the 6 course meal was really most of what's on the menu, just tiny portions.\none thing that i loved was the bread service. they offer soft butter topped with sea salt to accompany the various breads. that was so good. i liked the cherry walnut bread best.\ni ordered the <mark><mark>California Sea Bass</mark></mark> with sauteed vegetables. anyone who knows me knows i loooooove <mark><mark>California Sea Bass</mark></mark> and loooooove veggies.....however, this was just eh. i didn't even finish! i've never ever not finished a <mark><mark>California Sea Bass</mark></mark> meal, or veggie meal for that matter. it just didn't do it for me. the fish was flat and the veggies were.......eh...shoulder shrugs. and not for nothing, for $40, i should have loved my dinner.\ni had 2 pineapple ginger mojitos'. those were good, not great, but good. my friend ordered some weird bourbon drink that was actually very tasty. (i dont like bourbon, but i do seem to enjoy his drinks when i taste them).\nmaybe it's what i ordered (doubt it), but i wasn't impressed. \nthey offered some pistachio and raspberry \"tarts\" at the end of dinner and they were not good. the raspberry was so overpowering. i did like the homemade carmels that accompanied arvins' bday dessert. \nthe company was awesome, i had a great time. i just wasn't a fan of my food, and let's face it, that pretty important. so 5 stars for the company (as always), 2 stars for the food and 4 stars for service! so, we will be nice and give 3 stars.",

            "best meal of my life. i can't even describe the experience i had here with words. this place earned 5 stars in every single way possible when i ate here last night. beautiful is the only word i can come up with to describe my evening here. \n\ni was dinning here with a large group for a business dinner with clients. i have an egg allergy which makes going out to eat difficult sometimes. to avoid the humiliation of asking the server a million questions in front of clients i had called ahead to see what was available to me to eat on the menu. \n\nthe hostess was very polite and then said she would direct me to the kitchen, she put me through to the head chef...at 5pm....on a saturday, already amazing and unheard of service. he was one of the most caring strangers i have spoken with on the phone and told me he would accommodate anything i wanted to order to my allergy.\n\nwe arrived for dinner and the server was already informed of my allergy. i ordered an amaze balls moscow mule and then the chilean <mark><mark>California Sea Bass</mark></mark> where the server carefully adjusted the entree to cater to my allergy needs. the food came out and everyone's entrees were stunning, and made for awesome conversation at the table. my bass was perfectly spiced, and honestly just perfect all around. \n\nwe got dessert and i had a bowl of fresh fruit, at this point the head chef actually came out of the kitchen to make sure everything was okay. he explained his wife has allergies so it always hits home for him. it was the best service i have ever experienced, and i think this type of gesture is unheard of and truly a rarity. \n\nthank you so much spago for turning a potentially stressful dining experience into an extremely elegant and awesome evening, you guys are the sh*t.",

            "time visited: 8:45pm\ntime in line: 0 minutes\nhow long i waited for food: 30 minutes (could be more)\nseated: inside by server station\ntraffic: busy, w/many servers to accommodate.\nspent: entree's $40+/person, dessert $10-12/item\noccasion: birthday dinner\n\nwhat we ordered:\n\nsonoma duck breast cooked medium: this dish was recommended by the server as one of his personal favorites. this was the dish that ordered. this is one of the best duck dishes that i have ever received. it was cooked to perfection with the skin nice a crispy. the vegetables and sauces complemented the dish so well. i would come back again to order this dish.\n\npork chop the day's special cooked medium: the pork was cooked perfect and juicy. nicely flavored. the boyfriend ordered this dish, and his plate looked like it was locked clean, nothing left but the bone. \n\nfrench <mark><mark>California Sea Bass</mark></mark>: this was the second dish the server recommended. the fish was season perfectly with a hint of lemon. the fish itself was not dry, and the skin was so crispy (which i love).\n\ni would recommended these dishes as listed above. \n\nmy favorite dessert: out of the 3 we ordered, my favorite was the salted caramel souffle with figi apple sorbet. this was extraordinarily good! each element separately was amazing, together they were mind blowing. \n\nwe did have a slight issue: the duck i had ordered originally came to me overdone. from reviewing my photos, the dish also looked like it was originally incomplete. i don't usually send back food, but everyone at the table said i should, as the dish was expensive and should be prepared to my specifications. after letting one of our servers know, a new dish came out 15 minutes later served to me by the manager and several staff. they were sincerely sorry and wished me happy birthday. due to the slight hiccup my dish was on the house, as well as the desserts we ordered.\n\noverall: even with the hiccup, the experience was great. the staff tried their best to make sure that my birthday wasn't ruined. \n\nto be continued..."

            "this really was a treat that i didn't see coming. we were trying to go to mesa grill, but it was pucking facked. so you can tell, i was feeling something big and beefy which probably colored my menu selections a bit. enough about me, more about spago. note they have 2 different menus depending on where you sit (cafe and dining room). we sat in the dining room. \n\ngroup of 3 of us arrived at about 7:30 on a thursday, no wait at all (kind of atypical in vegas!). we sat down, were served super promptly, and got  an amuse bouche of potato leek soup brought out right away. awesome. they have a couple gin oddities on their bar, so i got a gin martini. almost lost some points since the waiter asked if i wanted a lime in it (that would be a gimlet, not a martini). but whatevs. the martini was done very well...it had a remarkable floral scent to it quite a treat...try the cape rock organic gin. it was also $14, but that seems more the norm than the exception in vegas.  \n\ni had the most elegantly presented <mark><mark>Heirloom Tomato Soup</mark></mark> in the entire world.  the waiter brought a covered bowl to my table, lifted the top off, and there was a beautiful dense red soup with a pine branch drawn into the top of the soup using a olive oil/basil sauce. stunning. and the soup was great too...the crouton served with it matched perfectly. very very well done here.\n\nsince i was in a meaty/grilly mood (expecting to head to a flay joint), i got the kobe <mark><mark>Grilled Flat Iron Steak</mark></mark>. it was also exceptional. the steak was perfectly well done, nice and chewy (its a flatiron people, it should be chewy), but not tough at all. it was served with some broccolini which fit this dish perfectly. i'm only sorry i was too full for dessert.  \n\nthey brought out an assortment of bread in a basket before the appetizers, and i was having a tough time choosing between them since they all sounded great. after i made a tough choice for the bread i had selected, the waiter asked if i wanted something else. it was perfect - i was able to sample all of the breads that sounded great to me. he also came back 2-3 times during the meal to see if we wanted any more. also, our water glasses never got below 1/3 full. its weird, i've always wondered why the mid-high end restuarants typically don't have this kind of service, when you are clearly going to pay a fair chunck of change for dinner. its awesome to see a place that really aims to please you in every way possible. also, the wait staff was generally transparent during the meal even though they were doing a lot of work clearing our table, customizing cutlery, filling water, etc.\n\nthe dining area is perfectly decorated. its a little trendy, but not blinking red light and technoey. the decor is so right because you can walk in there wearing anything (ahem...within reason) and not feel out of place. its great for any age group - 20ish to 60ish. its a little loud, but not disruptivley so. you are going to have to pay a bit for this place (app, dinner, and a single martini ran me $100 after tip), but i'd do it again on my own dime in a heartbeat.\n\nits one of those rare 5 star places. well done sir puck."

            "honestly, this is probably my favorite restaurant in the world. i try to get to vegas once a year, and this is the one restaurant i always visit. the staff is very nice, and i love the atmosphere and the location in caesars forum shops. a table in the patio section, which juts out into forum is a great place to people watch. i always say i want to try the dinning room, where i've never been, but i just like dining in the patio section too much.\n\ni was there on a tuesday evening in june, 2010. i had the english pea soup, and the mesquite grilled new york strip, which came with zucchini, caramelized onions, bone marrow crushed <mark><mark>Tuscan Fingerling Potatoes</mark></mark> and armagnac peppercorn sauce. it was delicious, just like everything else i've ever had there. \n\nif you like it here, you may want to try the wolfgang puck bar and grill at mgm, a nice place for late night dining after a show.", 
            "spago by wolfgang puck, his signature restaurant in las vegas\n\nthe decor is modern with warm oranges and red color schemes.  the restaurant is expansive, with a second floor, a bar area and an \"outdoor\" seating area so you can people watch as shoppers walk by.  we were seated on the first floor in a little raised area where we were the first diners of the night to sit there yet still had amazing service.\n\nwolfgang puck is known for his amazing modern american cuisine and as a treat for ourselves, we went for the chef's tasting menu.  officially 6 courses, we ended up with what seemed to be 8 courses.  for $95, you get a lot of food while you could end up paying somewhere in the $30s for an entree.  chef eric klein did not disappoint with small portions of his most popular menu items for tasting with some items that weren't available for order on any menu at spago, lunch or dinner.   \n\nbread: as many reviewers have noted, spago's bread platter is well known for very good reason.  with four choices that night, sourdough, cranberry walnut, flat bread and foccacia, you could not go wrong with any.  dipping platter:  olive oil infused with rosemary, salt, pepper and butter.  the bread was very good as advertised, something that i tried to pace myself with knowing that i had the tasting menu to come.\n\namuse bouche: duo of american kobe beef \"sliders\" brioche buns, bread-butter pickles, red onions, smoked gouda, house made ketchup, chilled maryland blue crab salad fragrant herbs, avocado, grapefruit segments, lemon vinaigrette and basil pistou\n-melt in your mouth kobe beef, a perfect bite with the pickles providing just enough tang but the crab salad was what stole the show.  the grapefruit and lemon vinaigrette was unbeatable in cutting through the richness of the crab salad.  amazing bite\n\nfirst course: margarita flambe: mozzarella, fontina, parmesan, goat cheese with garden tomatoes and basil\n-crispy and flaky crust with an intense tomato flavor.  the flambe was good, something that didn't stand out too much at the end of the dinner, great contrast between the crust and the flavor of the toppings\n\nsecond course: duo of yellowfin <mark>Big-Eye Tuna Tartare & Sashimi</mark>: watercress salad, lychee, chive and aji limon and avocado, daikon radish, scallion and yuzu-wasabi\n-served in a perfect ice sculpture, the presentation was dramatic.  each sashimi bite had incredibly fresh seafood, the tuna being highlighted by the lychee and  by the yuzu, very yummy flavorful punches\n\nthird course: soup/salad: farmers' market cauliflower soup\ntrumpet royale mushrooms, arugula and basil oil olsen farm's baby arugula salad farmers' market apple, shaved fennel, burrata cheese, prosciutto san daniele, ice wine vinegar and olive oil\n-the soup was very creamy, had hints of potato but was made with pureed cauliflower, the arugula and basil oil was a great way to cut through the creaminess, very yummy with a great balanced salad.  the apple, fennel and cheese were complimented by the ice wine.  overall, great course\n\nfourth course: hand rolled, ricotta gnocchi with porrcini mushrooms, black truffle butter, cheese foam,\nthe best course of the night! there is no way to describe the pillowy, fluffy gnocchi, this course is not available anywhere on the menu day or night, it can only be had through the tasting menu.  the heartiness of the mushrooms with the black truffle butter, was insanely delicious, i could eat this dish every day for a long time\n\nfifth course: grilled french <mark><mark>California Sea Bass</mark></mark> loup de mer: artichokes, baby carrots, haricot vert, cipollini, arugula, fennel pur\\u00e9e, artichokes barigoule broth au pistou\n-perfectly cooked fish, flaky with a crispy crust.  the broth was something that could've been drunk without any accompaniment, very tasty and the accompanying vegetables were great for the fish.\n\nsixth course: mesquite grilled prime filet mignon: sweet & sour red onions, celery, watercress, bone marrow crushed <mark><mark>Tuscan Fingerling Potatoes</mark></mark> and armagnac peppercorn sauce pistachio crusted colorado lamb chops\ncheese on top of the lamb, pickled beets and onions with balsamic reduction\n-the lamb was tender, with the peppercorn flavor coming right through and the filet mignon was tender and tasty.  after all the big bold flavors in the past courses, the meat course was a little lacking but still very tasty if i had just had that course.  i was still hooked on that gnocchi.\n\npalate cleanser: blood orange and passionfruit sorbet over blueberries\n-yummy sorbet that had a touch of bitterness that did its job, cleanse your palate after that long meal.  i ate the whole thing, def not just a palate cleanser\n\ndesert: crepe: dark chocolate, hazelnut, creme fraiche with orange glaze\n-great crepe, with just enough body in the crepe to balance the hazelnute and dark chocolate\n\noverall, great attentive service, great food, was greeted by eric klein himself, would do it again in a heartbeat if i had unlimited funds, well worth the money", 
            "i expected dining here to be good, but i was happily surprised at how good it was.  the environment is clean and open.  they did not cram in a ton of tables so you do not feel like other people are all over you.\n\nwe showed up on time for our reservation and were sat promptly.  the hostess was very friendly.  we were immediately approached by one of our servers.  everyone who spoke to us, including the manager were great.\n\nwe started with the olsen farm's baby arugula salad.  the salad comes with bartlett pears, burrata, prosciuitto, vinegar and olive oil.  the flavors combined nicely.  it was a nice start to the meal.\n\nnext we ordered the pumpkin agnolotti.  i am not a huge pumpkin fan, but the flavors together were very good.  mascarpone comes on the side and the agnolotti comes with with parmesan and truffles.  the textures also blend well together.\n\nfor my meal i ordered the grilled prime beef filet.  the filet was prepared perfectly.  it comes with carmelized red onions, watercress, celery, <mark><mark>Tuscan Fingerling Potatoes</mark></mark>, bone marrow persillade and peppercorn sauce.  while the filet is clearly the focus, the other components add even more to the meal.  the filet is seasoned lightly.\n\nfor dessert we chose the peanut butter souffle.  it takes about ten minutes for them to prepare it, but it is well worth that short wait.  it is so fluffy, and filled with rich peanut butter flavor.  the lemon ice cream on the side seemed out to me, but they went quite well together.  our server recommended we add a shot of chocolate liquor to the bottom of the plate for even more flavor.  it stepped up the flavor even more.\n\nit was a pricey meal.  that being said, it is well worth it for the experience."

            "i am a fan of all of wolfgang's restaurants in vegas. what i have found is that the quality of the preparation and ingredients is consistent across the board. so whether it postrio, the mgm bar and grill, or spago, its never going to disappoint. \n\nwhen talking about spago itself, there are several things i enjoy, the decoration and the music suit my tastes very well and make for a nice si down dinner. the bar is solid, i love being able to walk in without a reservation, sit down, and order a great pizza or dish of mussels for a very fair price.  great people watching too, vegas brings in every type of person from every type of country, and that's as good a show as anything i have paid to see!.\n\ngo to spago when you want to try something new. i have read reviews here of people being dissappointed about pasta dishes and other common every day fare. my memorable dishes have been tuna tartar in a crispy want<mark><mark>Three Oysters on the Half Shell</mark></mark>, lobster salad served on an asian soup spoon, pan fried sardine over a citrus vinaigrette slaw ( which was mind blowing!) some awesome mains i have had have been duck breast with cauliflower puree and root veg, where the fat was rendered off and made the meat ridiculously delicious and the skin crispy and perfect.  \n\ni write this on my latest trip to vegas and eagerly anticipate my new visit on thursday night!", 
            "had lunch here with the boyfriend. \n\nhe had the prosciutto wrapped meatloaf, which he loved.  i'm not a fan of meatloaf in general, but i tried a bit.  it was good.  if i were a meatloaf-lover, i would have loved it, too.\n\ni had the prix fixe menu: prosciutto/melon salad (amazing), spicy shrimp/tomato risotto, cherry pie.  the salad was absolutely delicious.  i love prosciutto and melon, so it wasn't a surprise that i loved the salad, but it was nice to have high quality ingredients.  the risotto was good, but not outstanding.  it was well-made, not mushy, and had a small kick.  a couple shrimp were slightly overcooked, though.\n\nthe cherry pie was good, but not excellent.  <mark><mark>Three Oysters on the Half Shell</mark></mark> was a little dry, and so were the cherries.  not enough of that juicy, cherry goodness.\n\ni almost forgot, when the bread guy comes around, make sure you get the cherry-walnut bread.  i could eat a whole loaf if given the chance.", 
            "delicious!\n\ni went here this past weekend while i was in vegas with my boyfriend and his friends. we were worried we were dressed too casual, but it doesn't seem to be that big of a deal. also, we went in around 8-9ish and we were seated without having to wait.\n\nthe bread basket they give you is so good! they give you raisin bread, a cheesy/onion bread, and parmesan cracker crisps. the parmesan cracker crisps were divine - i could eat a million of them, really.\n\nfor appetizers, my boyfriend ordered their crab cakes. yum! lots of sweet crab meat, slightly crispy on the edges, and a beautiful presentation with fresh flowers. another friend ordered their <mark><mark>Three Oysters on the Half Shell</mark></mark>, which i didn't try because i'm not that big of a fan of oysters, but everyone who tried it said they were super fresh and delicious.\n\ni ended up ordering their pan seared duck breast since one of my boyfriend's friends recommended it. it was really good! i loved the sweet sauce they put around the duck and the slightly crispy texture was great, as well. the duck was very moist and pretty much melts in your mouth. definitely recommend it!\n\ni tried my boyfriend's kobe ribeye. so good! it's the most expensive entree on the menu, but well worth it because the quality and quantity is incredible. so juicy, lots of flavor, and the pomme aligot, which is like cheese melted into mashed potatoes, was amazing with the meat! although i'd probably regret it later, i could eat that pomme aligot with a spoon. a tip for the kobe ribeye is that they cook it differently than other restaurants. my boyfriend ordered it medium well, but it actually looked more like medium rare. another friend at the table who ordered the same thing asked for it medium rare and it was pretty bloody.\n\nservice is very attentive, as well, which i would expect from such a nice restaurant. overall, good experience there, but it's definitely not an every day type of eating place. we'll probably only be going back if we win in blackjack again, lol.", 
            "after picking up tickets at will-call for absinthe, we figured \"hmmmm, now where to eat?\"\nwe were stranded on the expansive grounds at caesar's palace and figured the wisest choice was to check out the restaurants inside the hotel. \n\nthat being said, we headed straight for the forum shops!\na quick stroll lead us to wolfgang puck's world famous spago!\n\nhaving dined previously at the iconic beverly hills location, i came with an expectation of good quality food and great service. \n\nwe were running late so we wanted a quick but tasty meal. with the attractive al fresco dining option albeit indoors with artificial skyline and people watching galore, we opted for cafe seating. within moments, we were seated and began perusing the menu. \n\nfor appetizers, we enjoyed the oysters on a <mark><mark>Three Oysters on the Half Shell</mark></mark>. let me tell ya, these lil' guys were fresh, plump and with the addictively tangy cocktail sauce, it was a virtual party in my mouth! foodgasm guaranteed!\n\nnow onto the entrees:\n\nspaghettini with a side of roasted chicken - i've been on a scratch made pasta kick lately, so when i had heard they rolled out fresh pasta daily, i was instantly sold!  there's a difference in the texture, flavor and overall mouthfeel of the pasta! if you haven't had it fresh i strongly advise you try a plate of the spaghettini here. it's phenomenal! each strand was coursing with a vibrant red sauce which lent its wonderful aroma from the fresh basil. the richness of the sauce and marked acidity came from the ropa vieja tomatoes, which rounded out the flavor profiles of this winning dish perfectly.\nand the chicken? tender and juicy with an irresistibly crispy skin that i devoured in a flash!\n\nlamb chorizo pizza with rapini, sundries tomatoes, goat cheese and cilantro -  now this was my kinda pizza pie! it was nice and thin but definitely not lacking in the flavor department by any means. the lamb chorizo was savory and well seasoned and the crunchy rapini added a pleasant  contrast in texture. the chopped cilantro and fresh tomato brightened up the dish and definitely took this droolworthy pizza to another level of deliciousness! \n\nservice was prompt and friendly. our waters were always filled and staff constantly stopped by to see how we were doing, which was nice for a bustling cafe. we enjoyed an elegant meal that was quick, unfussy and delicious!\n\noverall, i was quite pleased with my experience here and it goes without saying i'd  definitely come back.  hopefully with time to spare on my next visit, ill give the main dining room a whirl.\n\nuntil then,\n\nhappy eats!", 
            "what really hasn't been said about spago both good and bad.  i can add a few tidbits that might help a brother out but that's about it.\n\nextremely amazing service.  everybody was very attentive and accommodating.  we brought our little boy here because we were invited by a good friend and some of his coworkers since we were all at the same conference that weekend. very thoughtful of them.  anyway, the staff was extra attentive to our son and really took the time to attend to his needs even though it was really hopping that night.  \n\nfor example, when he was a little fussy and i had to take him outside to walk around a bit, they gladly kept my food under a warmer for the few minutes that i was outside.  \n\nthe food was amazing as expected.  i will reel off a quick list of what we had.\n\niced <mark><mark>Three Oysters on the Half Shell</mark></mark>  with ginger-rhubarb mignonette - fresh and tasty like the sea.   i believe they were kumamoto oysters.\n\nwild pacific blue shrimp - no preservatives here.  fresh fresh fresh.\n\nsymphony of tuna - can't explain all the ways but yum, yum, yum.  \n\nchilled maryland blue crab salad - a spoonful of goodness. a bit of avocado, grapefruit segments and a lemon vinaigrette along with the crab served in a ramen type soup spoon.  wow.\n\ngrilled french <mark><mark>California Sea Bass</mark></mark> loup de mer - crispy skin and cooked perfectly.  the mousseline was nice.\n\npan roasted bone-in veal costoletta - sorry veal haters :(  this was very well cooked and despite being under the heat lamp for longer than the chef would have liked i'm sure (read above) it still was cooked very well and was tender as can be.  the risotto was oh so savory.\n\nfrom the words of my party, the salmon was the best that they have ever had, the halibut was so good that it resulted in a clean plate, and the filet was just ridiculous and served with the wgp signature bone marrow.\n\ni love good food and wgp never disappoints.  many thanks to our good friends for a great meal and next meal is on us.",

            "this was the dinner i have long been waiting for during my whole trip in vegas.  for the first time, my friends and i decided that it's time to go eat somewhere nice for once instead of mc d's and chipotle everyday meal.  we originally were split into two tables since they told us they can only accommodate 8 ppl max per table.  when we arrived they were able to put both of our tables together.  one thing i didn't like about this idea was that dealing with the check would be a hassle.  but thankfully the waitress was able to split our table's check into two.  major brownie pts!  \n\nnow to the food.  i don't know what my friends ordered, but i'm sure they were delicious.\n\ni ordered:\n\ntrio of <mark>Big-Eye Tuna Tartare & Sashimi</mark>, avocado, daikon radish, scallion and yuzu-wasabi\ncrispy rice cake, marinated cucumber & hearts of palm with soy ceviche-ginger vinaigrette\ntartare, sesame tuile \"taco\" with chili mayo and masago caviar\n\nthis dish was served to perfection!  each small taster was amazingly delicious.  the <mark>Big-Eye Tuna Tartare & Sashimi</mark> was paired perfectly with the daikon radish, scallion and yuzu-wasabi.  the crispy rice cake was awwwesome!  i mean the fish was good, but fried rice cake...mmmmm!  the tartare had a spicy kick to it, but not enough to make you scream to death.\n\ncolorado rack of lamb\ngreen garbanzo falafel, english pea hummus, marinated heirloom tomato fattoush,\nmint-cilantro tzatziki and zhatar\n\nyum!  the lamb was cooked perfectly.  it was slightly pink in the middle, but not bloody.  the falafel was delicious!  i swear these taste like meat, but not. haha\n\nmy friend ordered:\n\npan seared breast of duck\nsemolina fondue, morel mushrooms, cipollini onions, carrots, peas,\nglazed cherries and sauce \\u00e0 l'orange\n\nwhat more can i ask for?  normally when i go to a nice restaurant i usually choose the duck or the lamb.  tonight i had the experience to try both.  it was sure mouth watering!  really moist and succulent.  just delicious! mmmmmm i can go for some right now!\n\ndessert:\n\nsince this was for my birthday...they gave me a free dessert.  a cheese cake with mixed berries on top and a raspberry sorbet on the side.  it was very cheesy and tart.  i'm not a dessert kind of guy, but a free dessert is always yummy.\n\noverall, if you haven't tried out spago yet...i highly recommend it!", 
            "ate here after seeing \"absinthe\" at ceasar's with the help from some yelp reviews. took a seat at the cafe. enjoyed the calamari, <mark>Big-Eye Tuna Tartare & Sashimi</mark>, kobe sliders and finally the prosciutto pizza all with a glass of albarinho. the pizza was delicious. the sliders were good as well as the calamari and  sashimi. our server was helpful and playful. overall, this was a great option for good food at an affordable price as dinner and wine for 2 was just under $100.", 
            "spago by wolfgang puck, his signature restaurant in las vegas\n\nthe decor is modern with warm oranges and red color schemes.  the restaurant is expansive, with a second floor, a bar area and an \"outdoor\" seating area so you can people watch as shoppers walk by.  we were seated on the first floor in a little raised area where we were the first diners of the night to sit there yet still had amazing service.\n\nwolfgang puck is known for his amazing modern american cuisine and as a treat for ourselves, we went for the chef's tasting menu.  officially 6 courses, we ended up with what seemed to be 8 courses.  for $95, you get a lot of food while you could end up paying somewhere in the $30s for an entree.  chef eric klein did not disappoint with small portions of his most popular menu items for tasting with some items that weren't available for order on any menu at spago, lunch or dinner.   \n\nbread: as many reviewers have noted, spago's bread platter is well known for very good reason.  with four choices that night, sourdough, cranberry walnut, flat bread and foccacia, you could not go wrong with any.  dipping platter:  olive oil infused with rosemary, salt, pepper and butter.  the bread was very good as advertised, something that i tried to pace myself with knowing that i had the tasting menu to come.\n\namuse bouche: duo of american kobe beef \"sliders\" brioche buns, bread-butter pickles, red onions, smoked gouda, house made ketchup, chilled maryland blue crab salad fragrant herbs, avocado, grapefruit segments, lemon vinaigrette and basil pistou\n-melt in your mouth kobe beef, a perfect bite with the pickles providing just enough tang but the crab salad was what stole the show.  the grapefruit and lemon vinaigrette was unbeatable in cutting through the richness of the crab salad.  amazing bite\n\nfirst course: margarita flambe: mozzarella, fontina, parmesan, goat cheese with garden tomatoes and basil\n-crispy and flaky crust with an intense tomato flavor.  the flambe was good, something that didn't stand out too much at the end of the dinner, great contrast between the crust and the flavor of the toppings\n\nsecond course: duo of yellowfin <mark>Big-Eye Tuna Tartare & Sashimi</mark>: watercress salad, lychee, chive and aji limon and avocado, daikon radish, scallion and yuzu-wasabi\n-served in a perfect ice sculpture, the presentation was dramatic.  each sashimi bite had incredibly fresh seafood, the tuna being highlighted by the lychee and  by the yuzu, very yummy flavorful punches\n\nthird course: soup/salad: farmers' market cauliflower soup\ntrumpet royale mushrooms, arugula and basil oil olsen farm's baby arugula salad farmers' market apple, shaved fennel, burrata cheese, prosciutto san daniele, ice wine vinegar and olive oil\n-the soup was very creamy, had hints of potato but was made with pureed cauliflower, the arugula and basil oil was a great way to cut through the creaminess, very yummy with a great balanced salad.  the apple, fennel and cheese were complimented by the ice wine.  overall, great course\n\nfourth course: hand rolled, ricotta gnocchi with porrcini mushrooms, black truffle butter, cheese foam,\nthe best course of the night! there is no way to describe the pillowy, fluffy gnocchi, this course is not available anywhere on the menu day or night, it can only be had through the tasting menu.  the heartiness of the mushrooms with the black truffle butter, was insanely delicious, i could eat this dish every day for a long time\n\nfifth course: grilled french <mark><mark>California Sea Bass</mark></mark> loup de mer: artichokes, baby carrots, haricot vert, cipollini, arugula, fennel pur\\u00e9e, artichokes barigoule broth au pistou\n-perfectly cooked fish, flaky with a crispy crust.  the broth was something that could've been drunk without any accompaniment, very tasty and the accompanying vegetables were great for the fish.\n\nsixth course: mesquite grilled prime filet mignon: sweet & sour red onions, celery, watercress, bone marrow crushed <mark><mark>Tuscan Fingerling Potatoes</mark></mark> and armagnac peppercorn sauce pistachio crusted colorado lamb chops\ncheese on top of the lamb, pickled beets and onions with balsamic reduction\n-the lamb was tender, with the peppercorn flavor coming right through and the filet mignon was tender and tasty.  after all the big bold flavors in the past courses, the meat course was a little lacking but still very tasty if i had just had that course.  i was still hooked on that gnocchi.\n\npalate cleanser: blood orange and passionfruit sorbet over blueberries\n-yummy sorbet that had a touch of bitterness that did its job, cleanse your palate after that long meal.  i ate the whole thing, def not just a palate cleanser\n\ndesert: crepe: dark chocolate, hazelnut, creme fraiche with orange glaze\n-great crepe, with just enough body in the crepe to balance the hazelnute and dark chocolate\n\noverall, great attentive service, great food, was greeted by eric klein himself, would do it again in a heartbeat if i had unlimited funds, well worth the money", 
            "with so many restaurants to go to, it's sometimes tough to pull the trigger on one.  a friend chose spago.  it was awesome!  we started with their margarita and <mark>Big-Eye Tuna Tartare & Sashimi</mark> flatbreads.  i then could not decide between a spanish inspired seared ahi tuna or a french inspired halibut...chef klein happened to walk by and following a few minutes of pleasant conversation, i choice the halibut...amazing!  banana bread pudding was a great conclusion.  only negative is that it would have been nice to have a broader variety of reasonably priced wines.  highly recommend.", 
            "we ate at the spago cafe after getting in to vegas on a late flight.  the <mark>Big-Eye Tuna Tartare & Sashimi</mark> and oysters were superb as was the <mark><mark>Spago Chopped Salad</mark></mark>.  strawberry shortcake for dessert and two cocktails made with st germaine were perfect.  great service too.  will definitely return.", 
            "goodness me...this place is amazing. \n\nmy fiance and i were walking around and even though we weren't that hungry, we wanted to stuff our faces anyway because we're fatties. i came to spago three years ago (don't remember anything from then except that i liked it) so i recommended it. \n\nfirst off, top notch service. our waiter was friendly but not too overwhelmingly so. he left us alone to chat and enjoy our meal. we started off with a sangria topped with sweet fruit chunks that my fiance devoured. \nthen we ordered: (descriptions posted from their cafe menu at http://www.wolfgangpuck.com/restaurants/fine-dining/9044)\n\n<mark>Big-Eye Tuna Tartare & Sashimi</mark> -crispy rice cake, marinated cucumbers, hearts of palm with wasabiginger vinaigrette. best sushi i have ever had in my life! the sashimi melted in your mouth while the rice cake added just enough crisp to give it a little zing. the sauces complemented the flavors perfectly! \n\nand since we weren't too hungry, we split the wood-fired mushroom pizza which consisted of roasted portabellas, caramelized white onions, italian parsley and parmesan. i don't even really like portabellas and this was the best pizza ever. the cheese was great but not too cheesy, the pizza felt light and tasty, and the crust was perfectly baked and crunchy. i have died and gone to food heaven. \n\none of the best meals i've ever had, period. a must visit while in vegas! located inside of the forum shops at cesar's palace so a perfect break while shopping and walking! if you order the cafe menu, the environment is more relaxing and less expensive than the dinner, although dinner is great too!", 
            "a week ago we celebrated a birthday for my dear friend from nyc.  it was my idea for her to spend her birthday wkend in this infamous sin city, but it was our mutual friend from santa monica that hooked us up with a fabulous dining experience here at spago.\nso i admit, this review may be a bit skewed since our party of 6 received vip treatment... our friend knows the executive chef, eric klein and his wife. we were greeted by both of them, which was pretty cool. \n\nthe front of the restaurant has a more casual vibe with the open pseudo-patio facing the forum shops. we were led to the back of the restaurant which was the fine dining area. i immediately noticed sinatra playing in the background, which i love. we basically had a phenomenal 5 or more tastings prior to our chosen individual main entree.  the sommelier suggested an amazing red wine from santa rita hills: gypsy canyon... and i thought i was done with pinot noirs, but this wine was atypical for a pinot noir. it wasn't light, but more medium body and fruit forward. it paired beautifully with everything we ate. so i can't recall the order of what was presented to us... <mark>Big-Eye Tuna Tartare & Sashimi</mark>, amazingly fresh scallop, flavorful fennel soup... i admit i should have written this last week, because i can't recall each & every dish.  my main entree that i chose was the grilled french <mark><mark>California Sea Bass</mark></mark> which was absolutely delicious!  and dessert was decadent influences of chocolate... each of the 3 or 4 types of pastry was out of control... sinfully scrumptious!\n\nwe were definitely spoiled with exceptional delectable dishes and outstanding service.", 
            "wow. spago really blew me away. started off dinner with a carefully sculpted <mark>Big-Eye Tuna Tartare & Sashimi</mark>, arranged to look like an opening bloom. followed that with sauteed scallops, which were perfectly caramelized on both sides. and because i just couldn't get enough, i had to have the chocolate layered cake. \n\nservice was top-notch. executive chef eric klein was a regular on the floor and chatting with patrons. you could tell he really cared about the diners. he sent along a free butternut squash soup amuse bouche my way and ended the meal with a petit four, also gratis. \n\nhonestly, it was a meal that could've gone on forever. i didn't want it to end!", 
            "came here for a cocktail and light lunch during our most recent trip. the patio area is an excellent spot for people watching and the food is great.\n\ni had the indian notion cocktail--really light and summery with some cucumber and basil simple syrup. \n\nto eat, the <mark>Big-Eye Tuna Tartare & Sashimi</mark> and tartare was a small serving but pretty delicious. i really enjoyed the tartare with the wonton wrappers. the single piece of sashimi served with it was just okay however. also enjoyed the caesar salad which was classic and simple just how it should be. \n\noverall, definitely a great spot for a casual lunch especially when seated in the patio. can't wait to come back to try it for dinner.", 
            "spago was very accommodating to our party of 12. the staff was flexible with the change of our reservations and additional folks to our party. \n\nfood & drinks:\ni had the corn soup and <mark>Big-Eye Tuna Tartare & Sashimi</mark>. i wanted something light for dinner and this combination hit the spot. the corn soup does not appear to wow you upon first sight. no worries though because it all came down to taste. this is hands down the absolute best corn soup i have ever had in my life. i decided to share my soup experience with my friends and everyone was shocked as well. the soup is not too heavy but very fulfilling. the <mark>Big-Eye Tuna Tartare & Sashimi</mark> was also delicious and refreshing. i ordered a moscow mule after another patron sent over the same drink anonymously to our bride to be. we figured it out later and it was a nice russian couple who sent their congrats. \n\noverall it was a fabulous experience. order the corn soup!", 
            "don't come here for the food.  go for the atmosphere, the name, to be seen, whatever.  i've had better meals for 1/4 the price.  we arrived early before some of our other guests and sat down at the bar to have a drink.  we promptly got up and went somewhere else for that drink because of a strong fish stench overpowering the area- and i love fish- but it reminded me of a bangkok fish market in april.  the <mark>Big-Eye Tuna Tartare & Sashimi</mark> was almost flavorless.  prime filet mignon a little dry.  crab spaghettini unimpressive.  and a complaint to the waiter about the highly-salted side dishes, squash and brussels sprouts, unacknowledged.  i used to eat here often, it's gone downhill."

            "i've been here a couple of times and enjoyed both of them.  the last time we came the service was great, the food was excellent and the wine perfectly complimented it.  i had picked out my food from the menu when the waitress came by with some great specials.  a <mark><mark>Caprese Salad</mark></mark> with a wonderful variety of tomatoes... delish!  and their bread basket is great!  a large assortment to choose from to tide you over before your meal.  and they gave oil, butter and sea salt to go with it.  yum!  a nice place to go that's not too fancy but still serves delicious, high quality food.", 
            "i know i probably shouldn't be this impressed with spago but it blows my socks off! i've eaten here twice while in vegas on two separate visits. i actually wish i would have eaten here more each time. this past occasion we were debating not going to spago just because we had eaten here last time and there are so many places we just didn't get to try. however, someone made the brilliant decision that we were going to spago again and i'm thankful because this was once again my favorite meal in vegas.\n \nto start off i have to mention the awesome bread basket, so delicious, the flat bread, the sweet bread, the sourdough ahh my mouth is watering as i write this. the accompanying sea salt, butter and olive oil is also amazing.\n\non this trip to spago we sat \"outside\" and were able to order off of the cafe menu and the dinner menu. \n\nlast time we ordered the oysters and we remember how amazing they truly were by ordering them again. spago's oysters are the best and freshest in las vegas, if you eat oysters or just want to try them get them here.\n\nthis time there were 7 of us so we got to try a lot of menu items. \n\nthere were two orders of the special salad that night which was <mark><mark>Caprese Salad</mark></mark> with heirloom tomatoes and buffalo mozzerella. it was fantastic. i ordered the olsen farm's baby arugula salad, farmers' market pear & fig, shaved fennel, burrata cheese, prosciutto san daniele, ice wine vinegar and olive oil. i had them put the proscuitto on the side and someone else ate it. the salad was intense. the creamy burrata accompanied with the fresh fig and pears, so good. get this if you have a chance. \n\ni also ordered the farmer's market white corn soup, trumpet royale mushrooms, caramelized cipollini onions, fava beans, cherry tomatoes, arugula and basil oil. this was the all-star of the night for everyone who tasted it. it was so fresh and savory i would have licked the bowl if it would have been appropriate.\n\nfor entree's we had 3 orders of the hand cut fettuccini, wild oregon mushrooms, english peas, arugula, glazed shallots, parmesan-reggiano. this was a popular dish the last time we ate here so one of us ordered it again and two others joined along. it was as delicious as we remembered.\n\n2 orders of the caserecci pasta a la bolognaise,braised beef, roasted double blanched garlic, plum tomatoes, house made ricotta cheese. both people who ordered this loved it. \n\nunagi glazed scottish <mark><mark>Teriyaki Glazed Salmon Salad</mark></mark>, romaine lettuce, daikon radish, shiso, avocado, carrot r\\u00e9moulade , steamed jasmine rice, japanese vinaigrette. it looked beautiful.\n\nspago pancetta-wrapped meatloaf, russet potato pur\\u00e9e, mushroom gravy, port wine sauce, onion rings. my friend who ordered this jokingly said his was better, which he says about all food items but he thoroughly enjoyed it. \n\nto top it off we had another birthday here and this time they brought us out an assortment of cookies. we were all completely stuffed but we some how made some room for these cookies. \n\nlast but not least, for the quality of the food the pricing is on point. there are a ton of place in vegas that take your hard earned money while you sit back and wonder if it was really worth it. this is not one of them.\n\nthank you spago, when i return to vegas i will visit, more than once this time.", 
            "from start to finish everything was spectacular! i absolutely recommend this place to everyone. i love wolfgang but this place was by far his best restaurant i've been to. the service was beyond amazing. i ordered ice tea and i only had 3 sips a server replaced my drink bc my ice was melting now that's service! our main server ingrid was beyond pleasant, she was very friendly and by far the best service i've ever had. now if only we could get that kind of service at boa steakhouse! \n\nwe ordered the <mark><mark>Caprese Salad</mark></mark>, roast beef, and my favorite the salmon w jasmine rice and bok choy hong kong style! by far this is the best salmon i've had in my life. if only spago is in la, i would definitely come to this restaurant every week! very nice ambiance, excellent food and service what more can you ask for?! one of my favorite restaurant in the whole country!",

            "i wanted to take my other half somewhere special for his birthday, but that somewhere had to be a place i could eat. i found spagos can and does happily accommodate food allergies  (in my case that means gluten free). we arrived early for our reservation and were promptly seated. i ordered a hurricane and the waiter recommended a samurai (whiskey cocktail) to the birthday boy. the waiter was very knowledgeable on the menu, he explained what i could order and made a couple recommendations. we ordered a <mark><mark>Spago Chopped Salad</mark></mark> to share, the birthday boy ordered the scampi and i had the <mark><mark>California Sea Bass</mark></mark> special both were fantastic. for dessert we shared a peanut butter souffle and a plate of small treats. all the staff we encountered were friendly and helpful, the food was delectable. all in all spagos made the evening a resounding success.", 
            "we have come to this restaurant one other time while in vegas and it does not disappoint. we sat on the patio area which is perfect for people watching. the waiter recommend a bottle of wine that was exactly what we were looking for. we started withe the <mark><mark>Spago Chopped Salad</mark></mark>, very yummy!! i had the chicken meatball spaghetti and my husband had the roasted chicken, both were outstanding. overall one of my favorite restaurants! service was also great, very attentive and friendly.", 
            "can't complain, although it pales in comparison to some of the newer high-end restaurants that have opened in vegas.  it's much cheaper, though.  we ate with the \"cafe menu\" - not really sure why we didn't get the full dinner menu.\n\nthe appetizers were excellent - we shared the beet salad, the tuna tartar, oysters, and <mark><mark>Spago Chopped Salad</mark></mark>.  all were great, although the oysters weren't outstanding.  i had the vegetarian pizza for dinner, which was pretty standard fare.\n\noverall, i had no complaints, but it didn't blow me away.", 
            "i came here with high expectations, because the reviews were so good. the food was good, but it did not blow me away. i started with the <mark><mark>Spago Chopped Salad</mark></mark> and i found to be a unique and tasty presentation. for the main course i ordered the burger and fries. since i don't eat pork, i requested that the bacon aioli be omitted. the burger was from a very high quality of beef, cooked to perfection, served on a delicious pretzel roll. where i found things to be lacking, was in the service. the food runners and servers' assistants paid good attention, however my server never checked back on the specialty drink i ordered, nor any part of the meal. he dropped the check, without even asking me how anything was during my dining experience. i asked him to move remove the drink since it was a subpar version of what i ordered. i might give this place a second chance, but i don't imagine i'll be rushing back with the high number of quality restaurants to choose from in this city.", 
            "we had a wonderful meal at spago in the forum shops at caesars palace. karen provided amazing service. the <mark><mark>House Smoked Salmon Pizza</mark></mark> is a very unique dish. the house <mark><mark>Spago Chopped Salad</mark></mark> with quinoa is so freshly made with garden fresh veggies. the restaurant is absolutely stunning. a great choice to dine while in las vegas", 
            "went here with my mother while in vegas. first of all, warning there are side of the restaurant. the front is a cafe (casual) and the back is the main dining room... two different menus. my mother and i were seated in the cafe either due to not having reservations or being in casual attire. we ordered their highly recommended <mark><mark>House Smoked Salmon Pizza</mark></mark> which was not what i expected. the salmon completely covered the pizza from edge to edge and was cold. we ordered the <mark><mark>Spago Chopped Salad</mark></mark> which was delicious and the creme br\\u00fbl\\u00e9e was very good! wait staff didn't check on us much, which was annoying for how much money u spend there. not overly impressed.", 
            "another disappointing experience at a wolfgang puck restaurant. i went there for lunch with a friend and had the <mark><mark>Heirloom Tomato Soup</mark></mark> and a <mark><mark>Spago Chopped Salad</mark></mark>. the soup was pretty good but a world famous chef should be able to do better than that. the salad was almost inedible. it didn't mention on the menu that it would be covered in dill, which is something i would never order if i had known so i wasn't able to eat much of it and left most of it on my plate to be wasted, which i never do. i know liking or not like dill is a personal preference, but if it had just been listed on the menu i could have easily just ordered it without it. the lettuce was also a cheap iceberg and lots of just the spines which is really tacky and a big peeve of mine. there were very limited vegetarian options on the menu, so i thought this would be safe, but it was an unsatisfying meal to say the least."

            "this review is long overdue. i've probably eaten here at least 15 times over the last 4-5 years and i don't think i've ever had a bad meal here. it is one of the most consistent places i've been in vegas. \nwe usually try to eat at the spago cafe in the \"outside\" patio as opposed to the more formal and expensive main restaurant area. i found out on my last visit though that the lunch menu is the same for both areas but if you want a more casual and less pricey dinner, i would stick with the cafe. you will still get a great experience and a fantastic meal either way. \nmany of the dishes here rotate seasonally but some of the best stay on the menu year round. make sure to sample the bread basket, i love that crispy cracker thing they serve. my husband says the free range chicken here is just about the best chicken he's had. i always get the gazpacho here when they have it but unfortunately, that only seems to be a few months a year. however, their soups are amazing here. on my last visit, i had a cream of mushroom soup that came with a fancy grilled cheese sandwich and it was mouthwatering. one of the best soups i can remember having. some of the other dishes i've tried that i've enjoyed were the pappardele (although it is a bit on the heavy side) as well as the <mark><mark>Chinese Chicken Salad</mark></mark> sandwich. spago is known for their pizzas but it's been a long time since i've ordered that here so i really can't comment on that. \nall in all i love the food here and i love what this restaurant represents to vegas. this was pretty much the first high end restaurant to open in vegas in the early 90s and people were shocked that it did well. if not for spago's success, vegas would not be the high end dining mecca it has become.", 
            "we were looking for a casual, delicious lunch and we found it at spago.\n\nwe were seated near the cafe patio, which made for good people-watching.  i could have made my meal out of the bread basket that arrived first, especially with the crispy parmesean crisps and the cherry walnut bread.\n\nbut i did peel myself away to order a glass of wine (yummy $7 pino grigio--cheap compared to drinks i'd purchased that weekend) and the <mark><mark>Chinese Chicken Salad</mark></mark> sandwich.  the sandwich--filling, but not too much--came with kettle chips and a mixed green salad with a light vinaigrette.  it hit the spot.  wish we'd had room for dessert; maybe next time.\n\nour service was prompt and unobtrusive.  we definitely will be back.", 
            "i always wanted to try spago, so once we landed, hailed a taxi, i said let's go for lunch!\n\nit was a very white tablecloth, fancy place, though for lunch, people dressed very casually.\n\nwe started with an array of bread, crunchy soft, different butters.  i munched on the parmesan crispy bread.  i ordered the spaghettini and added shrimp.  they bring out this huge portion of spaghetti cooked perfectly, tossed with a basil, tomato sauce that tasted it was just started that morning and cooked all day.  and i got 3 huge grilled shrimp on the side.  the pasta was so flavorful i was already thinking about what to order there the next time we're in vegas.  \n\nhe got the thai <mark><mark>Chinese Chicken Salad</mark></mark>.  the half portion was plenty for lunch.  only the best chicken pieces were used.  he said it was wonderful.  it was topped with a nice ginger vinaigrette and absolutely the best value for $9 and he was full with a few pieces of bread.\n\nthis was one of the best lunches we've had in vegas, and if you go to spago for lunch, you are still getting the great quality you expect for dinner for a lot less.", 
            "wasting time in vegas will get you into trouble or find culinary awesomeness. \n\ni ordered a non-alcoholic drink called the raspberry velvet, very un vegas like of me. but oh well. it was a piece of heaven. raspberry puree with lime juice and seltzer. so refreshing!\n\nfor starters i had a small thai <mark><mark>Chinese Chicken Salad</mark></mark> that was a mish-mash of all sorts of itty bitty ingredients including some flowers, it too was fresh tasting, and the chicken was moist as well. very pleased. \n\nthen i had the <mark><mark>Margherita Pizza</mark></mark> to go. it was good, but the dough was a little thicker than what i'm used to, but still really very good. \n\nthen later the same night, i had a big dinner with 10 from work. it was a great evening. the staff was really great, they helped out with one gluten free eater. this waiter was on his game. he was really truly wonderful and the meals were really very good. \n\nthe top dishes were the red snapper, the pizzas, the braised short ribs with homemade gnocchi, and the desserts were pretty good too. the earl grey ice cream knocked me off my feet. i could have eaten that all day. i've made things with tea flavors and it can be difficult to achieve a strong flavor. this was gooood stuff.", 
            "i stopped in for dinner with a colleague after finding the wait at a nearby restaurant too long. it was about 6:30 and we were seated immediately. our waiter was great - extremely attentive. and between the waiter and the rest of the wait staff our water glasses were never empty.\n\nthe food itself was very tasty. i stopped short of giving it five stars because i wasn't completely blown away by the food, but it was very good. i had a thai <mark><mark>Chinese Chicken Salad</mark></mark> as an appetizer and received a good sized portion. this was followed up by an entree of lobster over a bed of risotto. the lobster was cooked well and flavorful, and the risotto had a nice mixture of wild mushrooms and sauce. all in all a really enjoyable meal at a reasonable price (for the vegas strip).", 
            "my tastebuds are tingling just thinking about that delicious thai style <mark><mark>Chinese Chicken Salad</mark></mark> i had at spago. it was deceivingly simple: cabbage, bean sprouts, carrots, sesames, cashews, pea shoots, radicchio, chicken...none of the ingredients were out of this world but somehow with the magic that is wolfgang puck and his powerhouse of restaurant awesomeness i found myself wanting to lick the bowl clean. why? because the chicken wasn't just chicken - it was so perfectly cooked: tender, moist, delicious. the cashews had a delightful crispiness with a spicy seasoning. all the veggies were cut so beautifully so that i could get a forkful of everything all combining with the perfect textures and flavors. and the dressing...oh that dressing....can i bathe in it? would that be unsanitary? because honestly, dress me up and down in that ginger vinaigrette and call me dirty. i'll be ok with that. \n\naside from the salad we also shared the lamb chorizo pizza and skirt steak quesadilla. no words. the pizza was beautiful - nice light crust with a slight char on it to give it that smoky flavor. all combined with a tangy goat cheese, sweet sundried tomatoes and...oh dear...here comes another wave of tingling tastebuds....\n\nsuffice to say it was all delicious.if you want to see their current menu:\nhttp://www.wolfgangpuck.com/content/files/foodmenu_slv%20lunch%20revised.pdf\n\nand yes, as others have said, the breadbasket was yum. my favorite was the cherry/nut bread! we actually asked for a second bread basket with just that bread!\n\nalso - if you can help it - come at lunch! you won't have to wait...we came at lunch, got seated immediately and had the best service.  they knew before i knew that our soda had to get refilled bringing out a fresh glass of soda to replace the dwindling one. \n\nall in all - yes yes yes!! and side note - for $2 you can go to tix4tonight (several locations throughout the strip) to get a discount (something like 10% off your meal). it didn't make a huge dent in our bill (saved us something like $5) but if you're doing dinner or a big lunch then definitely get that.\n\nand if anyone knows where i can take spago thai vinaigrette showers please message me. i won't judge you as long as you don't judge me.", 
            "came here on my last day in vegas for lunch, the reviews on yelp were good and i had heard about this place from a previous food blog as well.\n\ni was by myself so i sat at the bar, my bartender was very friendly and despite thinking i wasn't going to drink i ended up having a cocktail and a beer.\n\nthe atmosphere at spago is nice but casual, you can see everyone walking by in the forum shops and it does seem like a nice spot to come to for lunch, the place wasn't particularly crowded and along the bar there were only about two or three other patrons.\n\ni opted to try the thai <mark><mark>Chinese Chicken Salad</mark></mark> and the meatloaf.\n\nthe salad was a good starter, nice and flavorful, satisfying but not overly filling. i got the half portion which was a nice start and i probably could have shared that with someone. \n\nthe bread came nicely presented with three sides of salt, butter, and olive oil with a touch of rosemary. can't remember the three types of bread off the top of my head, one was a crispy pita-like bread, the other had cranberries in it i believe, and there was one more could have been sourdough but i can't remember.\n\nfinally the meatloaf, which is one of their most popular dishes apparently, was interesting, the mashed potatoes were cooked and seasoned nicely, for me the meatloaf was just alright -- it was good but i've definitely had better as well. \n\ni was in between giving this place 3 or 4 stars but i tilted towards 4 because the service was good and the food enjoyable enough to make me want to come back and explore the menu a little more.", 
            "the forum shops is my favorite mall so i'm there often and always go to spago!! it's always consistent- the service is always great and the food is good. i've tried many different things from their menu and never really had anything that i did not like!! \n\ni always start with the fried calamari. i love it!! it is delicious. the sweet chili sauce it comes with is delicious and the cucumber salad that it comes with is delicious!! though i get it every time, there is one thing i would change about it. i would use seasoned breadcrumbs!! if the breadcrumbs they use are seasoned, you really cannot tell at all. i know the sauce is supposed to provide the flavor but the calamari just needs a little kick. \n\nother items that i have tried that are very good are the black truffle fettucine, roasted organic chicken, spaghetti, chicken parm sandwich, asian <mark><mark>Chinese Chicken Salad</mark></mark> - they were all good and i would recommend any of those items!!\n\nand my favorite thing - the olive oil that they give in addition to sea salt and butter for the bread bowl. this olive oil is amazing!! it's very potent and has an intense flavor that i can't really describe but i end up dipping my chicken in it, french fries, calamari, potatoes, i will put that olive oil on anything!!!\n\nthe ambiance of this place is average. it's considered high end dining but i find it to be extremely casual. my boyfriend goes there in a hat and sneakers and they don't mind. i like it though - great food and not a stuffy place at all. the servers are always really cool too!!",

            "oh spago, you were a shining light of good food and service in las vegas!  turkey club sandwich rates a very good! side salad deliciousness. asian <mark><mark>Chinese Chicken Salad</mark></mark> was superior!  wait staff (james) was professional, attentive, engaging and fun!  a breath of fresh air in a town full of jaded employees (who wouldn't be?). enjoy spago! a lovely treat!", 
            "felt  level of service, once the cornerstone of this spago location, has dropped a notch. we sat at the bar where pro s like peter and tony once ruled the fortress. these guys looked like they were in grade school. effecient but dry, not friendly. we weren't brought or even offered a bread basket despite ordering a full dinner. sorry but that is weak. we also saw amd heard some animated bickering between a female bartender and a server. the short chubby gm guy who has been there awhile watched it from afar without stopping it or letting them know this type of behavior was unacceptable.  this gm seems to have gotten complacent in his job.  if i were a higher up in puck enterprises, id give this guy a dressing down or a demotion. this is not the spago i once knew.\n\nyet make no mistake. the food is still great. executive chef eric klein has put the puck staple chinois <mark><mark>Chinese Chicken Salad</mark></mark> on the spring 2013 menu and this salad is as good as any you will eat. the hong kong stlyle salmon was excellent. the rigatoni bolognese was stellar, however a bit rich. id recommend getting it easy sauce.\n\nwe didnt get dessert. a dessert menu was not offered to us either, again another sign of our first overall less than stellar spago experience.\n\n2 days later, with limited time before we had to head to airport, we went to the spago bar for a quick bite.  i told the female bartender with green eyes and freckles that i needed the food rushed. my wife got a salad and i ordered a pizza.  both were great.  the pie had too much cheese on it imo. wood fire pies are cooked at high heats for a short time. generally they need to have limited sauce and cheese.  was still solid and i forgot to ask for ez cheese like i always do.  this bartender was solid.  offered us bread despite the casual curcumstances and time of day. she was friendly but professional and got us our food out within 13-14 minutes.\n\nwe will be back as it is one of our favorite spots in vegas.  we hope to see the old familiar faces and the level of service we are accustomed to.", 
            "the food at spago is still very good but not as great as before. \n\nhowever, the level of service and warmth of staff is no longer the same. dont recognize most faces anymore and there lies the problem. the short balding gm has scowl on his face. if he isnt dry with us, he is barking at his staff.\n\nwe werent offered bread for dinner and lunch visits.  the pizza wasnt cooked well done as asked. the chinois <mark><mark>Chinese Chicken Salad</mark></mark> was way too spicy and overdressed. it has changed here. they need to learn how to make it like they do at puck's bar & grill at mgm which has really superceded spago in menu selection, flavor, and service.\n\nthe cuban style sandwich for lunch was excellent. i ate half and told her to pack the rest of my plate to go. bridget packed the leftover samdwich to go but not the housemade chips. that is lame.\n\nthe prime beef sliders..amazing. but 3 the size of a quarter each for $16...insulting\n\ndessert menu...lame\n\nthere was a time where spago was las vegas headquarters for us. read my past reviews. couple meals and couple visits to the bar at a minimum. those days are over.\n\nwe will eat here once for lunch on follwing trips, and that all.", 
            "what a wonderful restaurant.  they have stood the test of time.  always excellent service and good food at a reasonable price.  wolfgang's chinese take on <mark><mark>Chinese Chicken Salad</mark></mark> still is the best!  never miss this restaurant when i come to vegas.  only bummer is they have changed their dessert menu; don't like the changes.", 
            "i must say, i was pleasantly surprised by how great everything was; the service, portions, price (made sense), taste. \nwe ordered the asian <mark><mark>Chinese Chicken Salad</mark></mark> (has a dif name but i cant think of it at <mark>Spago Cold Pressed Juice of the Moment</mark>), the meatloaf, and 2 desserts. \nall portions were big enough to split among 2 or maybe even 3, depending on your appetite. \nthe salad didn't have too much dressing and had this crunch that i always enjoy in a salad so that was a great start. \nas for the meatloaf, i normally don't even consider eating meatloaf (for personal reasons) but my aunt recommended it and i can see why. very well balanced and probably one of the best i've had (but then again i haven't had much so...)\nas for dessert, we ordered key lime, light yet satisfying. \n\ndefinitely recommend!\n\nps. this review is extremely late as i just noticed i never clicked \"submit\"", 
            "the food was delicious, enough to warrant 5 stars easily. however, i really didn't like the service. we put our names down(without reservation, and on am evening, i can understand that there can be a wait). the hostess said we'd only wait 20 minutes, so we walked around the forum. after, we came back but our table still wasn't ready. we went to the bar and had overpriced, weak, and too sweet mojitos. my dad kept trying to nicely ask the hostess if she knew when our table would be ready, as we saw many open tables and other groups being promptly seated (he didn't mention that, though, because he isn't rude). however, she was very short with him and would keep making a point to not walk near us. \n\nalso, i went to the bathroom at some point, and the other hostess who came in opened the door quite briskly and almost hit me hard. she kept walking by me without any apology or acknowledgement. overall, the hostesses seemed much more stuck-up than they needed to be. \n\nour waiter was really nice, but the busboys were rude. one poured water without thinking and spilled water on our canon camera. he also took away my mom's drink when she was only halfway done with it. we did mention this to our waiter who felt terrible and got her a new one for free.\n\nagain, the saving grace here was the food. the pizza is out of this world. the <mark><mark>Chinese Chicken Salad</mark></mark> was incredible - huge portion but maybe could have used more greens. the pasta sauces were flavorful. even the bread loaf given to us was fresh.\n\nhowever, i really wasn't comfortable due to the service. we may have been tourists, but we weren't obnoxious or tacky. we were dressed quite nicely too. we spent good money there and could have been treated better.", 
            "i decided to try spago for lunch.  i was greeted and sat immediately.  i ordered the chinois <mark><mark>Chinese Chicken Salad</mark></mark> and an ice tea (tropical).    the service is so good at spago.  i would drink half of my ice tea and it would be filled up immediately.   the salad is the best <mark><mark>Chinese Chicken Salad</mark></mark> that you will eat.  i have had this before and it never disappoints.   a must if you don't have the original where you live.", 
            "not the same spago we used to know. peter, the bartender is gone. chicago tom is long gone. james, is gone.  servers wearing jeans???\n\nwe ate here twice. both times lunch. on our first arrival, we sat at host station for 5 minutes unattended as waiters and cooks and busboys stared at us.  when the host finally did arrive, he ofcourse did not apologize and ask us if we had waited long. than he tried giving me a tight spot in between 2 other couples eventhough the cafe was 66% empty. i said no. then he tried giving me a small table next to rail...i said no again. \n\nthat said the quality of the food is still excellent. the <mark><mark>Chinese Chicken Salad</mark></mark>, spago chopped (they should list cheese as ingredient in menu... we had to send it back), <mark><mark>Chinese Chicken Salad</mark></mark> sandwich and <mark><mark>Pepperoni Pizza</mark></mark> were phenomenal.  our servers were good. solid.\n\nperhaps executive chef eric klein is hamstrung by corporate and wolfgang himself at this flagship, but this menu is getting stale and old.  needs to be freshened up.\n\nat this point, i like lupo and puck bar & grill more. spago needs a breath of fresh air.  it is living in the past.", 
            "delicious <mark><mark>House Smoked Salmon Pizza</mark></mark> (their specialty) that is loaded full with delicious fresh salmon.\n\nthe <mark><mark>Chinese Chicken Salad</mark></mark> is a great compliment and totally delicious.  the greens are diverse and include watercrest and they r super fresh.  the salad tastes like a gourmet coleslaw without all the mayo.\n\nattentive and friendly staff.  fast service.", 
            "my husband really enjoyed the bolognese. i had <mark><mark>Chinese Chicken Salad</mark></mark> sandwich on cherry walnut bread which was ok. the bread was a little like fruitcake but if you like a little sweetness you will be happy. my pineapple ginger mojito was delicious as was my husband\"s margarita. next time i think i will go with a pizza.", 
            "this was the first place my bf and i ended up eating at while visiting las vegas. we went for dinner around 10 pm friday night. the restaurant wasn't busy but there were still a few full tables. the food here was amazing. we ordered the <mark><mark>Chinese Chicken Salad</mark></mark> and the mushroom goat cheese pizza.  both were fantastic. the only downside to the restaurant was the service. for the place to only be 25% full it was sometime hard getting a hold of our waitress. overall though a great dinning experience and we would eat here again.", 
            "spago was by far the best meal i had in vegas and it was for lunch. we did the prosciutto/fig salad and it was delicious! we also had a pizza and the <mark><mark>Chinese Chicken Salad</mark></mark> sandwich- awesome. if you are from the east coast (we are spoiled with awesome food) you should try this place to get the closest to home taste and very affordable! staff was great as well."

            "this really was a treat that i didn't see coming. we were trying to go to mesa grill, but it was pucking facked. so you can tell, i was feeling something big and beefy which probably colored my menu selections a bit. enough about me, more about spago. note they have 2 different menus depending on where you sit (cafe and dining room). we sat in the dining room. \n\ngroup of 3 of us arrived at about 7:30 on a thursday, no wait at all (kind of atypical in vegas!). we sat down, were served super promptly, and got  an amuse bouche of potato leek soup brought out right away. awesome. they have a couple gin oddities on their bar, so i got a gin martini. almost lost some points since the waiter asked if i wanted a lime in it (that would be a gimlet, not a martini). but whatevs. the martini was done very well...it had a remarkable floral scent to it quite a treat...try the cape rock organic gin. it was also $14, but that seems more the norm than the exception in vegas.  \n\ni had the most elegantly presented <mark><mark>Heirloom Tomato Soup</mark></mark> in the entire world.  the waiter brought a covered bowl to my table, lifted the top off, and there was a beautiful dense red soup with a pine branch drawn into the top of the soup using a olive oil/basil sauce. stunning. and the soup was great too...the crouton served with it matched perfectly. very very well done here.\n\nsince i was in a meaty/grilly mood (expecting to head to a flay joint), i got the kobe <mark><mark>Grilled Flat Iron Steak</mark></mark>. it was also exceptional. the steak was perfectly well done, nice and chewy (its a flatiron people, it should be chewy), but not tough at all. it was served with some broccolini which fit this dish perfectly. i'm only sorry i was too full for dessert.  \n\nthey brought out an assortment of bread in a basket before the appetizers, and i was having a tough time choosing between them since they all sounded great. after i made a tough choice for the bread i had selected, the waiter asked if i wanted something else. it was perfect - i was able to sample all of the breads that sounded great to me. he also came back 2-3 times during the meal to see if we wanted any more. also, our water glasses never got below 1/3 full. its weird, i've always wondered why the mid-high end restuarants typically don't have this kind of service, when you are clearly going to pay a fair chunck of change for dinner. its awesome to see a place that really aims to please you in every way possible. also, the wait staff was generally transparent during the meal even though they were doing a lot of work clearing our table, customizing cutlery, filling water, etc.\n\nthe dining area is perfectly decorated. its a little trendy, but not blinking red light and technoey. the decor is so right because you can walk in there wearing anything (ahem...within reason) and not feel out of place. its great for any age group - 20ish to 60ish. its a little loud, but not disruptivley so. you are going to have to pay a bit for this place (app, dinner, and a single martini ran me $100 after tip), but i'd do it again on my own dime in a heartbeat.\n\nits one of those rare 5 star places. well done sir puck.", 
            "i absolutely loved this place. one of my best meal experiences. \n\nthat said, i will begin with the truth. i had my doubts. i only knew a handful of things about wolfgang puck: (1) he's a celebrity chef, (2) he haz an accent, and (3) he cooks for the oscars. s'it. \n\nthis could have gone either way. it could be amazing because, well, he cooks for ze movie stars and he wouldn't be world famous if his food was awful. or, it could all just be hype.  \n\nwell, wolfgang puck is amazing, and he is famous for a reason. because his talent is delicious. \n\nthe food: we totally conquered. \n\nthe white peach bellini was one of or probably the best bellini i ever had. each sip was like biting into a crisp, juicy, succulent white peach. even though it didn't seem like very much in the glass, i got a nice little buzz from it. that must be quality champagne. \n\nthe bread waiters came and offered you as much as you wanted from a bountiful basket. we got to choose from a sourdough, a cherry walnut, an olive loaf, a cracker (with seeds, herbs, and things - since i don't like crackers, this was my least favorite), and an onion focaccia. the soft, slightly sweet, buttery cube of onion focaccia was clearly the favorite of the night. dipped in their quality olive oil, it was a great meal starter. \n\nthe amuse bouche was a cappuccino sized cup of cold, creamy pea soup. it tasted so fresh. as if you plucked the peas yourself, eating them while still standing in a garden, with your toes in the cool dirt. however, since i'm not a cold soup fan, i didn't like it that much. \n\nwe ordered several appetizers to share. the crab cakes, the <mark><mark>Heirloom Tomato Soup</mark></mark>, the warm wild mushroom salad, and the octopus salad. \n\nthe <mark><mark>Heirloom Tomato Soup</mark></mark> was probably my favorite dish of the entire night, and that's saying something since my meal and the warm wild mushroom salad were both incredible. i mean, sooo many wins here. the soup was large, came in a clay-pot sized, white porcelain bowl complete with cute hat, and a crostini that was spread with a creamy white cheese and then piled high with fluffy parmesan. on top of the soup was a thin design of balsamic vinegar that complimented the soup like jelly compliments peanut butter. spooning up a mouthful and letting the fresh tomato, sweet balsamic, exotic herbs, and delicate cream dance in my mouth was a little piece of heaven. \n\nthe warm mushroom salad was layered with mushrooms i can't name, but they were each delicious. some of the mushrooms were delicate, while others were slightly crunchy and \"meaty\" (like portobellos). the salad was tossed warm with arguala and pomegranate seeds and was a heart warming, unique salad that was perfect for a fall day (in windy las vegas). \n\ni ordered the special because i couldn't resist the following words: truffle-cream + alaskan king crab. other words like mushroom, onion, and fettucine were in there as well. it was, of course, awesome. i mean, it had truffle oil in it. truffle oil makes everything better! \n\nmy mom ordered the seafood paella and it was very tasty, though a tad undercooked, imo. the scallops and shrimp were huuuge! the bf ordered what i deemed the \"pig plate\" which consisted of pork belly, pork loin, and 3 kinds of sausage including blood - very neat concept. overall, every single person was over-the-moon pleased with their dinner. \n\nunfortunately (very very), i was over-ruled when it came to dessert. everybody else was too full, so we didn't try any. i bet they're fantastic though. next time... \n\natmosphere: ending with looks and folks. spago is hard, clean lines, it's modern art, mirrors, and black walls. too noisy for an intimate dinner, but fun for a family or group. service was polite, friendly, and extremely accomodating, but i didn't feel all warm and fuzzy like i did at alexander's. it was quite nice when they saw us pouring our own wine and decided to swoop in and do it themselves. nice catch. prices were surprisingly reasonable! you can spend $50 to $150 a person, your choice. \n\ni'm a puck fan now.", 
            "our party of 5 had a reservation, but we still managed to wait at least 15 minutes for our table, even though the restaurant wasn't crowded.  the decor is nice, nothing too impressive/distinct from other places.  for a cocktail, i ordered the peach bellini, which was pretty tasty.  a small tasting of the grilled cheese in <mark><mark>Heirloom Tomato Soup</mark></mark> was given, compliments of the chef.  one of my friends had been craving that combination of flavors, so it hit the spot for her and she loved it.  we ordered the \"seafood platter\" as a starter, but unfortunately, they were out of lobster, which is basically the best part!  for entrees, some ordered the surf and turf, which turned out to be mediocre good; less than expected.  i had the pasta special which i chose the option to have crabmeat with it was satisfying, but not sure i'd order it again.  the executive chef, eric klein, did make rounds throughout the restaurant, stopping by every table to make sure people were pleased.  he did stop by our table a few times, engaging in conversation each time.  turns out we knew some mutual people!", 
            "good service. very good food. enjoyed the sample of <mark><mark>Heirloom Tomato Soup</mark></mark>. had a raw seafood sampler for appetizer and a tuna dinner. all very good. great ambiance also. all around, a great time.", 
            "picky e. is in vegas for the weekend trying out the new restaurant capital of the u.s. friday was spago night. it was a bomb--note, not the bomb, but a bomb. the ambiance is weird--it's in the forum shops and the front opens to a patio to the shops. so, as you go in, you feel like you are going into any mall restaurant anywhere in america. as you go back into the restaurant, you never lose that mall feel.\n\nthe food did not save it. while the amuse was good (a taste of <mark><mark>Heirloom Tomato Soup</mark></mark>), it then took 40 minutes for my chicken to come out. the waiter made various excuses, but since there was no note on the menu saying the chicken takes forever, i am guessing there was some mistake made in the kitchen or by the expediter. when it did come out, it was undercooked--and i mean the kind of undercooked that is plainly visible under dark dinner lighting. so, picky had to send it back. it took another 10 minutes to finish cooking it (a testament to how under-cooked it was the first time and how badly the kitchen was running). mind you, the restaurant was not packed; there were plenty of open tables, tons of front of house staff, etc. so i have no idea what was taking so long in the back of the house.\n\nwhen i did get a food-safety approved plate, it was average. for $40 and 50 minutes, i would have liked a really good piece of chicken. i will give kudos to the vegetable prep cook--those were darn good, but it was hard to save the meal at that point.\n\nso, wolfgang, i think you need to check in on your las vegas digs. it's not living up to the spago brand.", 
            "i went to spago last night before the rod stewart concert and it was superb in every way, the room, the food, and the service!  i asked about the 6 course tasting menu and my server described the courses.  when he knew i had a show at 7:30, he thought i might not have enough time for the meal.  the he said, \"we'll make it happen.  we'll move things along.\"  the meat course was the only course in which i had a choice.  you could choose either a filet or a lamb chop. \n\nin a few minutes, michael brought a tray with four kinds of bread--cheese dusted lavash, cheddar bacon rolls, mini baguettes, and a cherry walnut bread.  i asked for some lavash and the bacon cheddar roll.  i didn't want to fill up on bread.  note:  with the bread, they serve butter with ground salt on top (hooray!)\n\nthe first course was a seafood course.  there were four compartments on the dish and each one had a small portion of a different fish.  the small spoon had crab, to the right there was some tuna, above on the right was a carpaccio of octopus and to the upper left was albacore tataki.  each had seasonings including an avocado pur\\u00e9e on one, a small piece of melon with another and so on.  great presentation.  wonderful flavors!\n\ncourse 2 was the salad course.  there were two parts to this.  one was a small cup of warm <mark><mark>Heirloom Tomato Soup</mark></mark> that was superb.  i asked michael if it was on the menu, but it's not.  it really was tasty.  along with the soup was a salad consisting of a wedge of yellow and red tomato.  it's been a long time since i had tomatoes with so much flesh and almost no seed.  there were 3 or 4 green beans lying diagonally across the tomatoes and there were some small cherry tomatoes and some more avocado pur\\u00e9e.  very light and lots of summer flavor.\n\ncourse 3 was the first fish course.  a bottom layer had a polenta flan.  on this was the grilled eel and on top of the eel was a fried quail egg.  the dish was decorated with some tasty cheese tuile.  the eel was moist and soft and fell apart with just a touch.  it was perfectly cooked!\n\ncourse 4 was the pasta course.  it consisted of agnolotti that was topped with pieces of lobster meat and there was some basil olive oil drizzled around the base of the pasta.  this was excellent also!\n\ncourse 5 was a second fish course--<mark><mark>California Sea Bass</mark></mark>.  the bass was placed on a layer of what appeared to be thin pasta.  after delving deeper, i found that they were extremely thin, narrow slices of yellow and green squash that could have easily been mistaken for pasta until you tasted them.  very clever execution and very tasty <mark><mark>California Sea Bass</mark></mark>.  there was also a piece of melon and a grilled cherry tomato.  you can see how the chef likes to mix contrasting flavors.\n\ncourse 6 was the meat course and i chose the lamb chop (rare).  it was an herb crusted chop that had been removed from the chop with the bone left there to chew on when the main part was gone. there was some pea pur\\u00e9e and some more basil oil.  it was truly superb!\n\nfor dessert, i first got a plate with three sorbets--blackberry, mango, and raspberry--and there was an extremely thin piece of white chocolate placed in the mango.  it was so delicate it almost melted when i picked it up.  then i was brought a pretty plate with grasshopper cheesecake and some house made mint ice cream with chocolate flecked throughout.  there were also some chocolate decorations, a loop and a rod that were very good.  last, i was brought 2 mignardises.  one was a watermelon jelly candy and the other one i think was marshmallow but i may be wrong.\n\nhuge thanks to a great serving crew--michael, my server, a young woman who was a busser in my area and had a wonderful personality, and the runners from the kitchen who explained each course beautifully.  it's too bad it wasn't recorded so i got more things correct in this review.\n\nmichael took my credit card as time got short and i left the restaurant about 10 minutes before the start of rod stewart.  they did an outstanding job of moving the courses along and i was in my seat with 5 minutes to spare.\n\ni have to come back in another season when the dishes are different and do the tasting again and take more time to savor each course.  i don't know why i overlooked spago for so long!!", 
            "i had a really hard time choosing between this or emeril lagasse's restaurant delmonico steakhouse in the venetian, so my dad suggested i come here for lunch. after looking at the celebrity figurines at madame tussauds wax museum and my gondola ride inside the venetian, i walked over here for lunch. located deep inside the forums shop of the caesar's palace, i was half an hour early but they sat me right away, they sat me at the bar. \ni asked my waiter if wolfgang was here and he said that he was at his other restaurant chinois in beverly hills (would've been nice to meet the original celebrity chef). i started off with a drink: honey-limeade soda (perfect contrast of sweet and sour), for my appetizer i got the soup of the day: <mark><mark>Heirloom Tomato Soup</mark></mark> topped with a swirl of basil pistou (similar to a pesto except that it lacks pine nuts) and a couple drops of extra virgin olive oil (so fresh). \nfor my entr\\u00e9e i got their: hand cut fettucini with wild oregon mushrooms (chanterelle and beech), english peas, arugula, glazed shallots (they were glazed in balsamic vinegar) and topped with freshly grated parmagiano regggiano (freshly made pasta, buttery peas that pop in your mouth, nutty parmesan, crunch from the glazed shallots and some chew from the mushrooms). i'm glad i listened to my dad when he suggested this to me, such an awesome place for lunch, next time i'll be sure to stop in for dinner !!!", 
            "another disappointing experience at a wolfgang puck restaurant. i went there for lunch with a friend and had the <mark><mark>Heirloom Tomato Soup</mark></mark> and a <mark><mark>Spago Chopped Salad</mark></mark>. the soup was pretty good but a world famous chef should be able to do better than that. the salad was almost inedible. it didn't mention on the menu that it would be covered in dill, which is something i would never order if i had known so i wasn't able to eat much of it and left most of it on my plate to be wasted, which i never do. i know liking or not like dill is a personal preference, but if it had just been listed on the menu i could have easily just ordered it without it. the lettuce was also a cheap iceberg and lots of just the spines which is really tacky and a big peeve of mine. there were very limited vegetarian options on the menu, so i thought this would be safe, but it was an unsatisfying meal to say the least."

            "wasting time in vegas will get you into trouble or find culinary awesomeness. \n\ni ordered a non-alcoholic drink called the raspberry velvet, very un vegas like of me. but oh well. it was a piece of heaven. raspberry puree with lime juice and seltzer. so refreshing!\n\nfor starters i had a small thai <mark><mark>Chinese Chicken Salad</mark></mark> that was a mish-mash of all sorts of itty bitty ingredients including some flowers, it too was fresh tasting, and the chicken was moist as well. very pleased. \n\nthen i had the <mark><mark>Margherita Pizza</mark></mark> to go. it was good, but the dough was a little thicker than what i'm used to, but still really very good. \n\nthen later the same night, i had a big dinner with 10 from work. it was a great evening. the staff was really great, they helped out with one gluten free eater. this waiter was on his game. he was really truly wonderful and the meals were really very good. \n\nthe top dishes were the red snapper, the pizzas, the braised short ribs with homemade gnocchi, and the desserts were pretty good too. the earl grey ice cream knocked me off my feet. i could have eaten that all day. i've made things with tea flavors and it can be difficult to achieve a strong flavor. this was gooood stuff.", 
            "oh yeah, love this place!! i will be coming back to this place for sure next time i'm in lv. \ni was having intense cravings for some gourmet pizza with goat cheese. my boyfriend and i were looking for a place to relax, share a glass of wine and enjoy a nice evening together. \nas i was walking by spagos', i saw the most amazing pizzas and knew this was our spot. our waiter found us a perfect cozy booth and gave us the cafe menu even though we were sitting in the restaurant area. the staff really went above and beyond. \ndinner started off with the most delcious bread medley -- parmesan , raisin bread, focaccia, rye. the best! we split the <mark><mark>Margherita Pizza</mark></mark> and the kobe burger. the pizza was best pizza i've probably ever consumed. the cheese blend was out of this world, topped off with the freshest basil, tomatoes and spices. the kobe beef burger was sensational --a delicious melding of juicy beef,applewood bacon and aioli sauce.  \ni must say spago's is my favorite restaurant in vegas so far. if i could find a place just half as good as spago's in my hometown, i'd be there at least every week!!", 
            "we came for lunch & were very impressed!\n\ni ordered the <mark><mark>Margherita Pizza</mark></mark> which was a large portion for one person. it was delicious! my husband ordered the burger which came with a side salad and fries. once again, it was huge & really good; highly recommend! \n\ni thought the prices were very reasonable, especially for vegas. also a great spot for people watching!", 
            "this place is ok. had early dinner with a friend since she wanted to eat @ spago. \n\nshe ordered oysters for appetizer, surprisingly came in a huge bowl for just 3 oysters. i wanted to get straight on to their oven baked thin crust pizza. i ordered my favorite <mark><mark>Margherita Pizza</mark></mark> thinking as long as they make a decent <mark><mark>Margherita Pizza</mark></mark>, they are good in my book.....well it was o-k. pretty decent size so i was only able to finish half of it, but as far as taste goes, it was good, but not memorable enough for me to go back. \n\nnot sure if you can call it an upscale dining experience since i was in my shirt and shorts being a tourist and stopped by after hours of shopping at the forum. location wise it doesn't stand out as an upscale restaurant.\n\ni also had thai salad. it was good but once again not memorable. \n\nmaybe what i ordered were just o-k but there could be other items on the menu that are great. oh yeah, the bread basket was good. better than many other restaurants as others mentioned.\n\nmy friend is the one who wanted to eat here but she didn't like her oysters, and she gave this place a 2.5 stars. to me this place is a 3.", 
            "walking around caesars palace not really having any idea where to eat, also with a few \"free\" drinks in me already and one in my hand, we decided spago looked pretty good from outside and the prices were reasonable enough, considering how much everything costs in vegas.\n\ni don't think i'd ever been to a \"wolfgang puck\" restaurant before, and i'm generally pretty cynical about anyone putting his name on multiple places in big tourist stops, but this stuff was good.  we ordered a calamari appetizer and a <mark><mark>Margherita Pizza</mark></mark> to share. both were wonderful, with the calamari coming with a delicious sweet and spicy sauce. \n\nalso they give you an assortment of bread before your meal comes out, and it's not just that wimpy little bread and butter crap. this was some fancy shiz. there were three different types with their own sauces, including sweet bread, with raisins or cranberry baked into it and topped with butter. also a different type topped with olive oil, etc. good stuff.\n\nthe pizza was delicious as well, with nice sharp cheeses and plenty to go around. the crust wasn't amazing but i was far from complaining.\n\nsomehow we managed to get out of here for $35 bucks. \n\ni would give 5 stars but didnt' try enough of the dishes, and like i said the pizza wasn't exactly perfect, but seriously i doubt you could do much better at caesars for the price.  had a giftcard to another wolfgang puck restaurant the following day (we didn't mean to go to two of his places, but that's how it worked out), and it wasn't nearly as good and cost twice as much.", 
            "20 feb 2012 | 4:00 pm-ish.\n\nlet me preface this review with a positive statement. spago's server assistants are top notch. ok, on to the rest. \n\nwish i could keep my review at around 5 stars, but here's the thing:\n1. the <mark><mark>Margherita Pizza</mark></mark> that my lady friends ordered didn't come with any basil! for some reason, i totally tuned out what they were eating, until i took a bite of the last piece of their pizza. yes, to a server, this sounds like a typical, \"we ate the whole thing, but didn't notice until the last piece\" - rip-the-waiter-off scenario. but sadly, it actually happened that way. when i brought it up to our server tony, and told him that the ladies had been too nice to bring it up, he gave me the \"you're trying to rip us off punk\" look, and said, i'll bring it up with the manager. when the bill came, nothing had happened, no apologies, nothing. we paid for a bland cheese pizza with tomatoes on it! hey tony, next time, just err on the side of trust and take off the damn pizza from the check that my friends had to endure...bless their hearts. as a server at at a fine dining restaurant, you are responsible for making sure every ingredient is on the dish before it hits the table. i'm sure t is a great guy, but management, i don't want him as my server next time. thank you. :) (i'm still trying to forgive myself for choosing to pay for it...)\n\n2. the last time i had the pancetta wrapped meat loaf, it had more beef and less of whatever they put in it this time. this time it was essentially a sausage loaf. the gravy and sauces were a bit off this time. i think the gravy turned out to be more of a watered down version of salsa verde, and the port wine sauce kind of got lost in the mix. the redeeming value of the dish? the potato/sweet potato puree and spinach. soooooo good. \n\n3. the crispy calamari was just that. crispy breading and tasty rings of squid. but all of us agreed that the marinated cucumbers and hearts of palm with coriander vinaigrette was the highlight of the dish. \n\nin the end, my recommendation is sit at the bar, your service will be phenomenal. \n\nps: is it not a requirement in vegas anymore that servers have to have a nametag? i had to specifically ask tony his name when he came to the table. no nametag...",

            "i enjoyed my meal at spago, but wasn't as impressed as my companions. the wedge salad is good but not notable, however the heirloom tomato and burrata salad special was outstanding - the best overall dish of the night.  \n\nwe ended up splitting 3 pizzas - i have to say, i found the crust to be disappointing on all of them. not much flavor at all - more of just a vehicle for the toppings.  as for the specific pies:\n-margherita - crust was a bit undercooked, and overall i would call this a pretty average <mark><mark>Margherita Pizza</mark></mark>\n-proscuitto - this was the best of the 3 - the proscuitto and fromage blanc worked perfectly together.  with a great crust this pizza would have mind blowing potential.\n-lamb chorizo - a very nice pie overall - enjoyed the chorizo, and the toppings all worked well together. \n\nservice was excellent.",

            "i sampled a variety of dishes here during lunch, including their <mark><mark>Margherita Pizza</mark></mark>, mushroom fettuccine, the fried calamari, and their prime rib sandwich. the food was average. nothing too special or too different from the many restaurants in vegas that serve casual but higher-end lunch options. i think there are better pizzas (secret pizza), pasta (olives), appetizers, and sandwiches around. it's not that the food here is not good; it's just not as good as others'. service was average and our party of 7 was able to sit down right away on a saturday afternoon.", 
            "we enjoyed a great lunch at spago. the <mark><mark>Margherita Pizza</mark></mark> was outstanding and i even tried a bite of aaron's <mark><mark>Pepperoni Pizza</mark></mark>, which was also incredible. the oysters we had for our appetizer were great and the mignonette that accompanied them was wonderful as well. we ended our lunch with the peanut butter souffle which was deliciously sweet and just the right amount of peanut buttery goodness. \n\noverall: spago offers a great lunch and is definitely worth visiting. next time im in town i look forward to trying out their dinner as well.", 
            "first let me say that i am a local .  i have frequented spago for lunch many times but today will be my last ! without getting into too much detail , the food was marginal ( i ordered the mussels ... very small in size and overcooked and my fianc\\u00e9e had a <mark><mark>Margherita Pizza</mark></mark> with mushrooms.  seriously , we had to examine the pizza to determine if they actually put any mushrooms on it !  the staff is indifferent ! most people are tourists and will not ever be a regular customer , therefore , they don't have to work for your return business ! here's a tip ! go to wolfgang puck at crystals at city center ! the food and staff and atmosphere are so much better and so much more enjoyable !and if you're a local you will get a 20% discount ! spago is basically a tourists restaurant ! you can do way better ! shop around !", 
            "we came for a casual lunch, and ordered the spaghetti and the <mark><mark>Margherita Pizza</mark></mark>, and also had the pineapple souffl\\u00e9. everything was delicious and the service was good. i want to come back for dinner for sure. i like the beverly hills location a little better, but i really can't complain when i eat at any spago.", 
            "an extra night in vegas never hurt anyone, and being able to dine at spago certainly helped boost the mood after missing the flight home. \n\nthe tuna tartare and the grilled octopus were great to start as both were seasoned extremely well. sharing a <mark><mark>Margherita Pizza</mark></mark> and the mac-n-cheese paired really well with the bottle of m\\u00fcller-catoir.\n\nthe service by jason and the rest of the staff was what i would expect from a wolfgang puck restaurant; but his attention to detail and casual conversation really made it more than just another \"good\" restaurant. the food was amazing, but the service is what will make me return."

            "really? this is one of the founding members of the foodie movement. it's nothing but a pasta p in the mall with nicer tables now. six hana oysters, a wood fired <mark><mark>Italian Sausage Pizza</mark></mark> and 2 ice teas set me back 48 dollars, without tip. the tip was 20 percent as the service was attentive and professional. but the cost value vs quality is skewed, even by 11 dollar beer special in vegas. \n\nbecause based on the round of appetizers, you are looking at 75$ to a 150$ a person, depending on drinks and deserts, and for that, i can hit any one of the solid 4 stars in vegas and get satisfaction. if you want to lunch at a over priced legend, i suggest you try emril's, i have a feeling it might deliver the bang i want for my buck. oh... again, pasta p quality on the wood fired pizza. not terrible, but not much more than that. my yardstick for the wood fired pizza is dephina's of san francisco",

            "it's amazing reading some of these reviews. i seriously wonder how knowledgeable people are about pizza when they state that the pizza here was \"fantastic.\"  i ate here two days ago and like most people ordering for lunch that day, i had a pizza.  i ordered the <mark><mark>Italian Sausage Pizza</mark></mark> with roaster fennel, tuscan olives, reggiano cheese and thyme.\n\nthis pizza tasted just like pizzas i have had at california pizza kitchen except theirs were better.  my pizza at spago had onions on it- the description on the menu did not say it came with onions.  quite frankly, the combination just did not work.  the onions and olives overpowered the flavor of the sausage, which was pretty tasty once it was off the pizza.  the reggiano cheese also did not work for me.\n\nwhen i am paying over $15 for a pizza, i expect better.  this is the second time i've been disappointed with a wolfgang puck restaurant.  next time i'm in vegas, i'll be sure to skip his restaurants.", 
            "yummy! not only is this the perfect spot to stop for lunch while shopping in the forum shops, but its really great food too. we sat on the more busy \"patio\" that is inside the shops more, and that is the perfect lunch spot. pretty casual, but still fine dining in the \"cafe\" for lunch. \n\nwe split the blt salad, and it was so good. the bacon is not stupid little bits, but big, real pieces! so much better. the dressing was also tasty. we split the <mark><mark>Italian Sausage Pizza</mark></mark> and i really liked the thin crust. the pizza was pretty good, but not the best i've had. the cheese was almost too thick on such a thin crust for my liking. i did like the addition of the olives. \n\nthe service was friendly, the food good, and the location perfect for a day shopping!",

            "summary:  spago is a great place to take a significant other.  the noise level in the cafe was not too loud which made it an enjoyable experience.  although unnerving while watching you dine, the wait staff does a great job of answering questions and clearing dishes from the table.  the pizzas are highly recommended but be willing to shell out some money for the drinks, cocktails and wines being the most unreasonably priced.\n\ni went to spago on new year's eve with my girlfriend.  fortunately i made reservations the week before.  our reservation was for 7:15 but i showed up a little early and was seated by 7:05.  there are two menus you can choose from; the cafe menu of the dining room menu.  the dining room menu has your meats and fine dining while the cafe menu has brick oven pizzas ad the like.  we opted for the cafe menu and ordered drinks, an appetizer, and our main meal all at once.  unfortunately they all came out at the same time (very quickly, about 20 minutes after ordering) so our pizzas got cool while we ate our calamari.\n\nthe cafe, although mostly open to the forum shops street mall, was not as loud as you might expect.  conversation was easily audible.  the wait staff was friendly and had no trouble answering any of the questions i had about the menu.  it is a little unnerving however since the wait staff lines along the side wall when they are not helping diners, observing the dining room and seeing if any diners need them.  they just stand there...looking...watching....constantly vigilant.  that aside, they do great at being johnny on the spot for clearing dishes and helping with questing.\n\nthe calamari served with their sweet chili sauce was fantastic.  the chicken <mark><mark>Italian Sausage Pizza</mark></mark> was equally fantastic and was a fairly large portion that i almost did not finish because it made me full.  the drink prices were the most unreasonable and unpleasant thing i encountered at spago.  soda is $4.50 and the cocktails range from $10-17.  i ordered a vesper and it was $16, where a fair price could have been $9 or $10.", 
            "wolfgang puck has done it again! spago is located in the caesar's palace forum shops right next to la perla and closer to the casino end. semi casual and upscale, my sister, brother in law, and i came here for lunch on christmas day. we were seated quickly at around 12 without a need for a reservation.\n\nservice here is great- our server was attentive and our water cups were never empty. at first look this restaurant looks pretty small but once you go inside, you will realize that they actually have two levels and a relatively large bar. although the rest of the restaurant looked nice, the restroom looked like it could use some upkeep and was on the dirtier, messier side.\n\nwe ordered the sliders as an appetizer, a chicken <mark><mark>Italian Sausage Pizza</mark></mark> for my brother in law, an <mark><mark>Italian Sausage Pizza</mark></mark> for myself, and a chicken sandwich for my sister. the best item here on the menu is the sliders. delicious, melt in your mouth, and delectable sliders. i would've eaten those as the main entree if i could.\n\none star down for the rest of the food. definitely not bad, but definitely not \"as worth\" coming back for as the sliders. the chicken sandwich breast tasted dry, and neither of the pizzas were memorable. for the three of us with tip, the meal came out to around $90.", 
            "all the restaurants at caesar's were full for dinner, so we ventured into the forum shops and stumbled on spago. having eaten there before for lunch, we decided to try  it for dinner. after looking at the menu, we decided to share most courses, starting with calimari, then a caesar salad, and finally, the <mark><mark>Italian Sausage Pizza</mark></mark> and a bowl of gnocci.\n\nthe food was good; my only complaint about the food that that the gnocci was $21 and the portion was small. \n\nthe reason for my 3-star rating was the service. saying it was \"attentive\" would be an understatement. i like attentive service just as much as the next person, but the waitress and her assistants acted like they were in a keystone cops' movie where all of the action is accelerated. i no sooner put down my fork then the next course came and had not finished my glass of wine before the bus person whisked it off the table. it was very obvious she wanted to turn the table for the next diners, but honestly, for a check that totaled $95 before tip, spago should let its diners relax a bit. \n\non the way out, i mentioned the problem to the hostess who offered to get the manager. i suppose i should have let her, but we had already paid the bill and were on our way out.  we may be back, but only if we could eat at the bar.", 
            "came here for lunch last sunday with a reservation just because it is a smaller location. it was alright but for the pricing, it wasn't anything crazy good. unless you're coming here for pizza, i'd rather go to mesa grill or cheesecake factory. also one thing i really hated, was the fact that it wasn't too busy but everything took forever! a quick lunch ended up being 2 1/2 hours! we would have ordered dessert but we didn't want to wait another 30 minutes for that.\nfor appetizer we had the prime beef sliders. the flavor was really delicious and the beef was really tender but oh my goodness, these are the smallest sliders i've had in my life. their height was the length of my thumb and was as big around as a silver dollar. also, their baby portion of fries was good but again, the portion was hilarious. i think these were about $16? not worth it.\nmy boyfriend had the chicken <mark><mark>Italian Sausage Pizza</mark></mark> and sure the portion was great but that's because it's a pizza. the flavor was good, but you could get the same at settebello or cpk. they also served it with pasilla peppers on top.\ni had the atlantic salmon. salmon was cooked perfectly but their pairing with the curried califlower didn't match in my opinion. nothing memorable for this dish either and i believe the pricing was about $28.\nhonestly, if everything had been about $5 cheaper, they would maybe get 4 stars because nothing was really wrong with anything we ate but everything we tried, we could get somewhere else with better flavor, more reasonable pricing, and it wouldn't have taken 2 1/2 hours. sorry spago, this one was a miss for me. i would defintiely recommend bobby flay's mesa grill for a lunch option at caesar's instead.", 
            "i came here for a quick lunch with my family before we left to drive back to la. after doing a little last minute shopping in caesar's we got hungry and decided to try spago. we all shared the chicken <mark><mark>Italian Sausage Pizza</mark></mark>, their handcut fettuccini with shrimp, a burger, and a plate of their calamari. the prices here were actually pretty decent for vegas, as were the portion sizes. the pizza was very warm and crispy, but a bit too thin for my liking, as i usually prefer pizzas that are thicker and heavier. i think my favorite dishes of our meal had to be the fettuccini and calamari. the calamari was breaded nicely and chewy like how calamari should be. however, the crowd favorite was definitely the handcut fettuccini. the fettuccini came with 3 fresh pieces of <mark><mark>Chilled Jumbo Shrimp</mark></mark> served on top a nice warm bed of noodle-like pasta. i say \"noodle-like\" because unlike most pastas, spago's fettuccini had a texture that was more like the texture of asian egg noodles.\n\nthe only complaint i had was that in contrary to the what others mentioned in their reviews, my family was not at all offered bread and had to ask both our waiter, and the woman who seemed to be the head waitress, twice for a plate of bread. not only that, but they didn't serve the bread to us until the rest of our food was out as well.", 
            "stopped in for lunch saturday around 3 pm - it was jammed packed up front (where we were seated).\n\nit took awhile to get our drinks and we never received any bread.\n\ni ordered the chicken <mark><mark>Italian Sausage Pizza</mark></mark> and gnoochi, my date a pear and apple salad.\n\nthe pizza was ok, the gnoochi serving was small, and without bread, not filling. it wasn't creamy/rich enough for my liking, but would have made a perfect appetizer. \n\nthe pear and apple salad was very good! great combination of flavors! \n\nour waiter was pre-occupied with another table, and didn't take care of us well. \n\nprobably wouldn't go back but the food was ok."

            "i know i probably shouldn't be this impressed with spago but it blows my socks off! i've eaten here twice while in vegas on two separate visits. i actually wish i would have eaten here more each time. this past occasion we were debating not going to spago just because we had eaten here last time and there are so many places we just didn't get to try. however, someone made the brilliant decision that we were going to spago again and i'm thankful because this was once again my favorite meal in vegas.\n \nto start off i have to mention the awesome bread basket, so delicious, the flat bread, the sweet bread, the sourdough ahh my mouth is watering as i write this. the accompanying sea salt, butter and olive oil is also amazing.\n\non this trip to spago we sat \"outside\" and were able to order off of the cafe menu and the dinner menu. \n\nlast time we ordered the oysters and we remember how amazing they truly were by ordering them again. spago's oysters are the best and freshest in las vegas, if you eat oysters or just want to try them get them here.\n\nthis time there were 7 of us so we got to try a lot of menu items. \n\nthere were two orders of the special salad that night which was <mark><mark>Caprese Salad</mark></mark> with heirloom tomatoes and buffalo mozzerella. it was fantastic. i ordered the olsen farm's baby arugula salad, farmers' market pear & fig, shaved fennel, burrata cheese, prosciutto san daniele, ice wine vinegar and olive oil. i had them put the proscuitto on the side and someone else ate it. the salad was intense. the creamy burrata accompanied with the fresh fig and pears, so good. get this if you have a chance. \n\ni also ordered the farmer's market white corn soup, trumpet royale mushrooms, caramelized cipollini onions, fava beans, cherry tomatoes, arugula and basil oil. this was the all-star of the night for everyone who tasted it. it was so fresh and savory i would have licked the bowl if it would have been appropriate.\n\nfor entree's we had 3 orders of the hand cut fettuccini, wild oregon mushrooms, english peas, arugula, glazed shallots, parmesan-reggiano. this was a popular dish the last time we ate here so one of us ordered it again and two others joined along. it was as delicious as we remembered.\n\n2 orders of the caserecci pasta a la bolognaise,braised beef, roasted double blanched garlic, plum tomatoes, house made ricotta cheese. both people who ordered this loved it. \n\nunagi glazed scottish <mark><mark>Teriyaki Glazed Salmon Salad</mark></mark>, romaine lettuce, daikon radish, shiso, avocado, carrot r\\u00e9moulade , steamed jasmine rice, japanese vinaigrette. it looked beautiful.\n\nspago pancetta-wrapped meatloaf, russet potato pur\\u00e9e, mushroom gravy, port wine sauce, onion rings. my friend who ordered this jokingly said his was better, which he says about all food items but he thoroughly enjoyed it. \n\nto top it off we had another birthday here and this time they brought us out an assortment of cookies. we were all completely stuffed but we some how made some room for these cookies. \n\nlast but not least, for the quality of the food the pricing is on point. there are a ton of place in vegas that take your hard earned money while you sit back and wonder if it was really worth it. this is not one of them.\n\nthank you spago, when i return to vegas i will visit, more than once this time."

            "it's like marnee thai in san francisco or fantastic cafe in long beach or mastro's ocean club in laguna beach or le diplomat in irvine. \nwhen i think of las vegas, i think of spago and vice versa. we make it a point to eat here each time we go to vegas, whether we win or lose, stay at the flamingo, planet hollywood, bellagio or caesars. we have to. and the best part is that the menu is ever-evolving. \n\nduring our last visit we had \n1. oven roasted day boat alaskan halibut\n2. grilled virginian line caught striped bass\n3. creme brulee \n4. peach tea\n\nfor our most recent visit, it was just as good. we had:\n1. mediterranean <mark><mark>California Sea Bass</mark></mark>\n2. california roll\n3. stir fried shanghai style egg noodles.\n\ni loved my alaskan halibut my last visit so i asked the waiter what was similar to it and he pointed me to the mediterranean <mark><mark>California Sea Bass</mark></mark>. it was not as soft/flaky as chilean <mark><mark>California Sea Bass</mark></mark>, but still good. it was served over a celery apple puree with celery hearts and huckleberry. it gave it an interesting, almost sweet flavor, but not what you would expect when hearing \"apple\" and i love how they prepare it in such a unique way that i know i won't likely find a dish like it anywhere else. \n\nthe california roll was excellent as well - nothing like any of the other california rolls i've tasted - for this, the authentic crab meat was marinated in a lemon vinaigrette. \n\nmy wife was quite pleased with her noodles, but was a little disappointed that it contained pork. after picking those pieces out though, it was delicious but a bit on the spicy side. \n\nwhat i failed to mention in my last review was the bread. we always look forward to it. a waiter comes by with a basket of four different kinds and a dish with butter, pepper, olive oil and salt. if you go, definitely try the cherry walnut bread - so good and just the right amount of sweet. the honey focaccia was tasty as well.  \n\neach time i go there, i'm confident that whatever the chef puts on the menu is delicious. i'll continue going here as long as it's around and like i said before, if i could give it six or seven stars, i would. my all time favorite fancy restaurant.", 
            "i went with a group of 8 people and we all had great dishes. this place is a must go to every time i'm in vegas now. \n\nthe wait staff was absolutely delightful. they took care of us like we were the only people in the restaurant even though it was full during dinnertime. our server definitely anticipated our every need and was great. my little sister is a vegetarian and we were scared they didn't have any options for her but they were able to put together a meal that was superb for her! they gave her 4 dishes of the sides that they usually make for each of their four top selling dishes. the chef also sent out a complementary tasting of the lobster bisque. if i didn't already order at the time, i would have gotten that for my meal. \n\nthe cherry walnut bread was the best of all the breads! our table loved it so much that the bread staff came by and kept refilling our plates without us even asking! i started off the dinner with the lobster salad. i thought it was going to be a lot of salad and not a lot of lobster but the ratio was really good. they portioned it out enough that i was able to get a piece of grapefruit, avocado, lobster, and greens in every bite. the flavors worked so well together that i was amazed. for my entree i had the scallops which were perfectly cooked. i love scallops but never have i had them so sweet and not overcooked. my boyfriend had the mushroom pizza which was also very delicious. if i were to go back, i think i would order what my older sister ordered. she got the <mark><mark>California Sea Bass</mark></mark>. \n\nfor dessert since it was my sister's birthday they wrote happy birthday on the apple dessert. the honey mascarpone cream was to die for! \n\nthe best part was that before the dinner they asked us if we were on a time schedule which we were. we had to make a show after dinner and they were very quick with everything from the food to the check that it gave us plenty of time to enjoy our dinner and to make the show on time. \n\nmake sure that you stop by this restaurant if you're in vegas because you'll definitely enjoy all of the food.", 
            "-california roll with crab meat marinated in lemon vinegrette\n-stir fried egg noodles shanghai style\n-mederterranien <mark><mark>California Sea Bass</mark></mark>\n\nthese were the three dishes i had the last time i was here.  every time i go to vegas, my husband and i make it a point to eat here.  it's just that good.  i love the bread tray that comes out each time, especially the cherry walnut bread with their butter.  the service here is top notch too.  i'd recommend any of the fish dishes, the steak dishes (if you are a meat eater), and their teas/desserts are freakin' bomb.  sometimes, they'll even provide a nibblet of appetizer or dessert on the house!\n\nyou just can't find their dishes anywhere else, and the ambiance, it makes every trip worth it.\n\ni think what really makes me love this place more is that it's my husband's and my 'date' place.", 
            "wolfgang puck!!!!  ok, i know this is kind of a celebrity chef joint, but hey puck is a celebrity chef for a reason, he hires great chefs to run his restaurant for him.  we had tuna three ways as an appetizer and it was fantastic. great even.  i highly recommend this.  we also had a octopus salad which was very tasty.  at our table, we had a lambchops, <mark><mark>California Sea Bass</mark></mark>, mahi mahi, roast chicken, ny steak, and i forget what i had, but all of these items are delicious.  perhaps the thing that everyone appreciated the most was the complimentary asparagus soup.  although perhaps not the best restaurant that i have eaten at (hells kitchen probably takes that), it is still a solid place to go on a saturday night with friends and enjoy some prosecco and a sauvignon blanc and malbec.  definitely recommend this for a bachelor party if you have foody friends.  make sure to have reservations, and make them earlier, at 6 or before is perfect and you can get a great table no waiting.", 
            "pricyyyyyyyy :( but the service is excellent; the waiters were around constantly making sure we were all right and that our cups were filled! i have only ever gone here for lunch, which was pretty good with decent prices, but for dinner:\n\nseafood appetizer special: very pricy...there was four of everything (oysters, <mark><mark>Chilled Jumbo Shrimp</mark></mark> cocktail, and a spoonful of crab salad). not worth the $ in my opinion, but the food was indeed fresh and quite delish.\n\nhong kong style salmon: being of hong kong descent, it didn't really taste \"hong kong\" to me...had a weird twang from the soy sauce. salmon was very soft and cooked just right though. vegetables had the same weird twang, but was still edible.\n\n<mark><mark>California Sea Bass</mark></mark>: yum! i got mine gluten free (yes, gluten allergy sucks!) and the waiter reassured my terrified little brain that they dealt with allergies of all kinds all the time and that they would be sure to keep my gluten allergy in mind. so my meal is a bit different from the usual...it really consisted of an excellently cooked <mark><mark>California Sea Bass</mark></mark> with a bunch of buttery chopped greens on the bottom. pretty good.\n\ndiver scallops: came with this cool foam on top. scallops i felt could be cooked to a more golden tone, but it was still good. i kept biting in some sand or something though.\n\nthe meals were way too pricey for the amount we got, but i guess in classier restaurants, that's just the way it is! presentation was amazing and everything was cooked to perfection. employees were very professional and friendly...i'd come here again, but maybe for lunch so my wallet won't implode.", 
            "spago by wolfgang puck, his signature restaurant in las vegas\n\nthe decor is modern with warm oranges and red color schemes.  the restaurant is expansive, with a second floor, a bar area and an \"outdoor\" seating area so you can people watch as shoppers walk by.  we were seated on the first floor in a little raised area where we were the first diners of the night to sit there yet still had amazing service.\n\nwolfgang puck is known for his amazing modern american cuisine and as a treat for ourselves, we went for the chef's tasting menu.  officially 6 courses, we ended up with what seemed to be 8 courses.  for $95, you get a lot of food while you could end up paying somewhere in the $30s for an entree.  chef eric klein did not disappoint with small portions of his most popular menu items for tasting with some items that weren't available for order on any menu at spago, lunch or dinner.   \n\nbread: as many reviewers have noted, spago's bread platter is well known for very good reason.  with four choices that night, sourdough, cranberry walnut, flat bread and foccacia, you could not go wrong with any.  dipping platter:  olive oil infused with rosemary, salt, pepper and butter.  the bread was very good as advertised, something that i tried to pace myself with knowing that i had the tasting menu to come.\n\namuse bouche: duo of american kobe beef \"sliders\" brioche buns, bread-butter pickles, red onions, smoked gouda, house made ketchup, chilled maryland blue crab salad fragrant herbs, avocado, grapefruit segments, lemon vinaigrette and basil pistou\n-melt in your mouth kobe beef, a perfect bite with the pickles providing just enough tang but the crab salad was what stole the show.  the grapefruit and lemon vinaigrette was unbeatable in cutting through the richness of the crab salad.  amazing bite\n\nfirst course: margarita flambe: mozzarella, fontina, parmesan, goat cheese with garden tomatoes and basil\n-crispy and flaky crust with an intense tomato flavor.  the flambe was good, something that didn't stand out too much at the end of the dinner, great contrast between the crust and the flavor of the toppings\n\nsecond course: duo of yellowfin <mark>Big-Eye Tuna Tartare & Sashimi</mark>: watercress salad, lychee, chive and aji limon and avocado, daikon radish, scallion and yuzu-wasabi\n-served in a perfect ice sculpture, the presentation was dramatic.  each sashimi bite had incredibly fresh seafood, the tuna being highlighted by the lychee and  by the yuzu, very yummy flavorful punches\n\nthird course: soup/salad: farmers' market cauliflower soup\ntrumpet royale mushrooms, arugula and basil oil olsen farm's baby arugula salad farmers' market apple, shaved fennel, burrata cheese, prosciutto san daniele, ice wine vinegar and olive oil\n-the soup was very creamy, had hints of potato but was made with pureed cauliflower, the arugula and basil oil was a great way to cut through the creaminess, very yummy with a great balanced salad.  the apple, fennel and cheese were complimented by the ice wine.  overall, great course\n\nfourth course: hand rolled, ricotta gnocchi with porrcini mushrooms, black truffle butter, cheese foam,\nthe best course of the night! there is no way to describe the pillowy, fluffy gnocchi, this course is not available anywhere on the menu day or night, it can only be had through the tasting menu.  the heartiness of the mushrooms with the black truffle butter, was insanely delicious, i could eat this dish every day for a long time\n\nfifth course: grilled french <mark><mark>California Sea Bass</mark></mark> loup de mer: artichokes, baby carrots, haricot vert, cipollini, arugula, fennel pur\\u00e9e, artichokes barigoule broth au pistou\n-perfectly cooked fish, flaky with a crispy crust.  the broth was something that could've been drunk without any accompaniment, very tasty and the accompanying vegetables were great for the fish.\n\nsixth course: mesquite grilled prime filet mignon: sweet & sour red onions, celery, watercress, bone marrow crushed <mark><mark>Tuscan Fingerling Potatoes</mark></mark> and armagnac peppercorn sauce pistachio crusted colorado lamb chops\ncheese on top of the lamb, pickled beets and onions with balsamic reduction\n-the lamb was tender, with the peppercorn flavor coming right through and the filet mignon was tender and tasty.  after all the big bold flavors in the past courses, the meat course was a little lacking but still very tasty if i had just had that course.  i was still hooked on that gnocchi.\n\npalate cleanser: blood orange and passionfruit sorbet over blueberries\n-yummy sorbet that had a touch of bitterness that did its job, cleanse your palate after that long meal.  i ate the whole thing, def not just a palate cleanser\n\ndesert: crepe: dark chocolate, hazelnut, creme fraiche with orange glaze\n-great crepe, with just enough body in the crepe to balance the hazelnute and dark chocolate\n\noverall, great attentive service, great food, was greeted by eric klein himself, would do it again in a heartbeat if i had unlimited funds, well worth the money", 
            "delicious. after a short wait, my boyfriend and i were in for a great dining experience.  spago is located in the forum shops and is a wolfgang puck restaurant.  the decor inside is elegant, service was tremendous, and to food was amazing.  my boyfriend's beef tenderloin was huge and juicy.  my <mark><mark>California Sea Bass</mark></mark> was moist and buttery, just how i like it.  the calamari was standard.  all in all, a great dining experience but a little tough on the wallet!\n(+) service, decor, taste\n(-) pricey, crowded",

            "what really hasn't been said about spago both good and bad.  i can add a few tidbits that might help a brother out but that's about it.\n\nextremely amazing service.  everybody was very attentive and accommodating.  we brought our little boy here because we were invited by a good friend and some of his coworkers since we were all at the same conference that weekend. very thoughtful of them.  anyway, the staff was extra attentive to our son and really took the time to attend to his needs even though it was really hopping that night.  \n\nfor example, when he was a little fussy and i had to take him outside to walk around a bit, they gladly kept my food under a warmer for the few minutes that i was outside.  \n\nthe food was amazing as expected.  i will reel off a quick list of what we had.\n\niced <mark><mark>Three Oysters on the Half Shell</mark></mark>  with ginger-rhubarb mignonette - fresh and tasty like the sea.   i believe they were kumamoto oysters.\n\nwild pacific blue shrimp - no preservatives here.  fresh fresh fresh.\n\nsymphony of tuna - can't explain all the ways but yum, yum, yum.  \n\nchilled maryland blue crab salad - a spoonful of goodness. a bit of avocado, grapefruit segments and a lemon vinaigrette along with the crab served in a ramen type soup spoon.  wow.\n\ngrilled french <mark><mark>California Sea Bass</mark></mark> loup de mer - crispy skin and cooked perfectly.  the mousseline was nice.\n\npan roasted bone-in veal costoletta - sorry veal haters :(  this was very well cooked and despite being under the heat lamp for longer than the chef would have liked i'm sure (read above) it still was cooked very well and was tender as can be.  the risotto was oh so savory.\n\nfrom the words of my party, the salmon was the best that they have ever had, the halibut was so good that it resulted in a clean plate, and the filet was just ridiculous and served with the wgp signature bone marrow.\n\ni love good food and wgp never disappoints.  many thanks to our good friends for a great meal and next meal is on us.", 
            "i've never been to a wolfgang puck restaurant or cafe that i didn't like... and spago was no exception!\n\nthe service was superb, the food was delicious, and the atmosphere was elegant in the dining room. my mom kept commenting on how there were more waiters then customers for a saturday night, but we did originally get there around 5:45pm and the dining room eventually filled up and was almost full when we left two hours later (we ate leisurely and had coffee with dessert after our entrees).\n\nbefore our entrees came out, we were given a plate of olive oil, sea salt, pepper, and butter for some artisan breads that were served by a waiter (whose only job it seemed was to serve bread). the selection was quite diverse with an onion foccacia, an herb & cheese lavash, sourdough, cherry walnut bread, and pretzel bread. i tried one of everything and would have eaten more if i didn't know were were going to get our appetizer and entrees soon.\n\nspeaking of entrees, i ordered the new england diver sea scallops with three giant scallops that were perfectly cooked. it was topped with a mascarpone foam that was pretty to look at and fun on the plate, but had little taste. however, the flavors of the rest of the dish definitely made up for that. my brother had a taste and mentioned that he would have eaten 10 of those scallops instead of his entree. the appetizer we ordered was a special one not on the menu, and i am so happy with our choice. we got persimmon and prosciutto flatbread with fromage blanc... it was heaven. i don't know how they made the crust so light, crisp, and airy, but i would go back just for that.\n\nmy brother ordered the choucroute garnie royal that comes with mustard, sauerkraut, blood sausage, regular sausage, chicken sausage, and pork belly. he couldn't stomach the blood sausage (and neither could i) but the rest of the sausages were decent. edible, but not amazing. my brother wishes he would have tried the duck... i do too because it sounded great on the menu!\n\nmy mom ordered the grilled french <mark><mark>California Sea Bass</mark></mark> loup de mer, and it was amazing! the portion was very generous and the grilled onions and artichoke under the fish itself complemented very well with the dish. she loved her dish so much, she didn't even want to try any of our food.\n\nmy dad ordered the chilled maryland blue crab salad because he was still semi full from an earlier meal. i'm so glad he was full because he would have ordered chicken or steak and we would have missed out on this yummy dish! each bite of crab, avocado, and grapefruit was like a party in my mouth. the flavor combo is not one i would have ever put together, but it was on point!\n\nfor dessert, we had the chocolate souffle with ice cream. the ice cream was delicious, but the souffle was not my favorite.\n\noh, i almost forgot... the best part about the dining experience at spago was the little things they did to set them apart from other restaurants. first, my glass of water was never half filled, it was always full. second, they gave us complimentary parsnip soup with truffle oil. third, around the time the bill came, the waiter produced a mini plate of chocolate petit fours.", 
            "a week ago we celebrated a birthday for my dear friend from nyc.  it was my idea for her to spend her birthday wkend in this infamous sin city, but it was our mutual friend from santa monica that hooked us up with a fabulous dining experience here at spago.\nso i admit, this review may be a bit skewed since our party of 6 received vip treatment... our friend knows the executive chef, eric klein and his wife. we were greeted by both of them, which was pretty cool. \n\nthe front of the restaurant has a more casual vibe with the open pseudo-patio facing the forum shops. we were led to the back of the restaurant which was the fine dining area. i immediately noticed sinatra playing in the background, which i love. we basically had a phenomenal 5 or more tastings prior to our chosen individual main entree.  the sommelier suggested an amazing red wine from santa rita hills: gypsy canyon... and i thought i was done with pinot noirs, but this wine was atypical for a pinot noir. it wasn't light, but more medium body and fruit forward. it paired beautifully with everything we ate. so i can't recall the order of what was presented to us... <mark>Big-Eye Tuna Tartare & Sashimi</mark>, amazingly fresh scallop, flavorful fennel soup... i admit i should have written this last week, because i can't recall each & every dish.  my main entree that i chose was the grilled french <mark><mark>California Sea Bass</mark></mark> which was absolutely delicious!  and dessert was decadent influences of chocolate... each of the 3 or 4 types of pastry was out of control... sinfully scrumptious!\n\nwe were definitely spoiled with exceptional delectable dishes and outstanding service.",

            "i've always wanted to try the vegas spot which started the whole celebrity chef craze and the 20th anniversary throw-back menu was the perfect excuse!\n\nfirst on that night you couldn't beat the prices, we ordered two of the <mark><mark>House Smoked Salmon Pizza</mark></mark> for the tables, entrees and dessert.  if the prices were always this low i'd give it 5-stars easily!\n\ni didn't see anything which jumped out on the menu so i asked the waiter who recommended the <mark><mark>California Sea Bass</mark></mark>.  i'm normally not the type of person to order seafood unless i'm at a strictly seafood place but i decided to trust the server.\n\nthe <mark><mark>California Sea Bass</mark></mark> was really good, crispy and cooked to perfection.  i was very satisfied with my decision and it's given me a little more faith to try something new on a menu!  the <mark><mark>House Smoked Salmon Pizza</mark></mark> i could tell was very fresh, underneath was a sort of tarter sauce which i could have done without.  i'm not a huge salmon fan so i'm surprised i ate 2 slices.\n\nfor dessert i had the souffle which i think is one of the over the top presentations for a dessert.  i've had this before at the former mgm grand detroit location so i knew what to expect, but it was still amazing as always.\n\nservice was really good, i guess when i give a 5-star rating though it's for places which i constantly think about going back to and this one just doesn't come to my head.  no doubt i'd go back though!", 
            "their 6 course tasting menu exceeded my expectations. we got here a little before 6 pm and service was excellent. the bread options were delicious, especially the bacon cheddar biscuit and the parmesan crunchy bread. the tasting menu started off with: \n\n1) tuna done three ways as sashimi, in a cone, and flatbread with home made ricotta cheese\n2) corn soup with burrata salad that was a refreshing appetizer \n3) truffle oil pasta with shaved truffle and foam (our favorite! a euphoric blend of flavors)\n4) avocado, crab and grapefruit which was a refreshing palate cleanser \n5) <mark><mark>California Sea Bass</mark></mark> with tomato broth\n6) seared duck with a crunchy exterior and medium rare. \npalate cleanser: we finished off with a mango sorbet with granita. \n7) dessert was raspberry sorbet with custard, foam\n8) chef's sample of truffle and passionfruit marshmallow.\n\nthroughout dinner, the service was attentive, and multiple waiters asked us how we were doing. the chef came out multiple times to check up on how our meal went. overall, an impressive tasting menu. highly recommend this place!", 
            "i went to spago last night before the rod stewart concert and it was superb in every way, the room, the food, and the service!  i asked about the 6 course tasting menu and my server described the courses.  when he knew i had a show at 7:30, he thought i might not have enough time for the meal.  the he said, \"we'll make it happen.  we'll move things along.\"  the meat course was the only course in which i had a choice.  you could choose either a filet or a lamb chop. \n\nin a few minutes, michael brought a tray with four kinds of bread--cheese dusted lavash, cheddar bacon rolls, mini baguettes, and a cherry walnut bread.  i asked for some lavash and the bacon cheddar roll.  i didn't want to fill up on bread.  note:  with the bread, they serve butter with ground salt on top (hooray!)\n\nthe first course was a seafood course.  there were four compartments on the dish and each one had a small portion of a different fish.  the small spoon had crab, to the right there was some tuna, above on the right was a carpaccio of octopus and to the upper left was albacore tataki.  each had seasonings including an avocado pur\\u00e9e on one, a small piece of melon with another and so on.  great presentation.  wonderful flavors!\n\ncourse 2 was the salad course.  there were two parts to this.  one was a small cup of warm <mark><mark>Heirloom Tomato Soup</mark></mark> that was superb.  i asked michael if it was on the menu, but it's not.  it really was tasty.  along with the soup was a salad consisting of a wedge of yellow and red tomato.  it's been a long time since i had tomatoes with so much flesh and almost no seed.  there were 3 or 4 green beans lying diagonally across the tomatoes and there were some small cherry tomatoes and some more avocado pur\\u00e9e.  very light and lots of summer flavor.\n\ncourse 3 was the first fish course.  a bottom layer had a polenta flan.  on this was the grilled eel and on top of the eel was a fried quail egg.  the dish was decorated with some tasty cheese tuile.  the eel was moist and soft and fell apart with just a touch.  it was perfectly cooked!\n\ncourse 4 was the pasta course.  it consisted of agnolotti that was topped with pieces of lobster meat and there was some basil olive oil drizzled around the base of the pasta.  this was excellent also!\n\ncourse 5 was a second fish course--<mark><mark>California Sea Bass</mark></mark>.  the bass was placed on a layer of what appeared to be thin pasta.  after delving deeper, i found that they were extremely thin, narrow slices of yellow and green squash that could have easily been mistaken for pasta until you tasted them.  very clever execution and very tasty <mark><mark>California Sea Bass</mark></mark>.  there was also a piece of melon and a grilled cherry tomato.  you can see how the chef likes to mix contrasting flavors.\n\ncourse 6 was the meat course and i chose the lamb chop (rare).  it was an herb crusted chop that had been removed from the chop with the bone left there to chew on when the main part was gone. there was some pea pur\\u00e9e and some more basil oil.  it was truly superb!\n\nfor dessert, i first got a plate with three sorbets--blackberry, mango, and raspberry--and there was an extremely thin piece of white chocolate placed in the mango.  it was so delicate it almost melted when i picked it up.  then i was brought a pretty plate with grasshopper cheesecake and some house made mint ice cream with chocolate flecked throughout.  there were also some chocolate decorations, a loop and a rod that were very good.  last, i was brought 2 mignardises.  one was a watermelon jelly candy and the other one i think was marshmallow but i may be wrong.\n\nhuge thanks to a great serving crew--michael, my server, a young woman who was a busser in my area and had a wonderful personality, and the runners from the kitchen who explained each course beautifully.  it's too bad it wasn't recorded so i got more things correct in this review.\n\nmichael took my credit card as time got short and i left the restaurant about 10 minutes before the start of rod stewart.  they did an outstanding job of moving the courses along and i was in my seat with 5 minutes to spare.\n\ni have to come back in another season when the dishes are different and do the tasting again and take more time to savor each course.  i don't know why i overlooked spago for so long!!", 
            "i'm being extremely kind and generous giving this 3 stars. personally, this is a 2 star place all day long, however, the service was excellent, that i'm bumping to 3 star. i came here for a friends birthday party. there were 14 of us and 8 of the group opted for the 6 course meal ($100pp) and the rest of us ordered a la carte. \noddly, the 6 course meal was really most of what's on the menu, just tiny portions.\none thing that i loved was the bread service. they offer soft butter topped with sea salt to accompany the various breads. that was so good. i liked the cherry walnut bread best.\ni ordered the <mark><mark>California Sea Bass</mark></mark> with sauteed vegetables. anyone who knows me knows i loooooove <mark><mark>California Sea Bass</mark></mark> and loooooove veggies.....however, this was just eh. i didn't even finish! i've never ever not finished a <mark><mark>California Sea Bass</mark></mark> meal, or veggie meal for that matter. it just didn't do it for me. the fish was flat and the veggies were.......eh...shoulder shrugs. and not for nothing, for $40, i should have loved my dinner.\ni had 2 pineapple ginger mojitos'. those were good, not great, but good. my friend ordered some weird bourbon drink that was actually very tasty. (i dont like bourbon, but i do seem to enjoy his drinks when i taste them).\nmaybe it's what i ordered (doubt it), but i wasn't impressed. \nthey offered some pistachio and raspberry \"tarts\" at the end of dinner and they were not good. the raspberry was so overpowering. i did like the homemade carmels that accompanied arvins' bday dessert. \nthe company was awesome, i had a great time. i just wasn't a fan of my food, and let's face it, that pretty important. so 5 stars for the company (as always), 2 stars for the food and 4 stars for service! so, we will be nice and give 3 stars.", 
            "this was my favorite restaurant in vegas for years and i'm pleased they seem to have maintained their excellence.\n\nmini raviolis with corn were good, especially after getting a cute little bowl of salt to bring out the flavor.  tuna tartar with sashimi was good, <mark><mark>California Sea Bass</mark></mark> excellent. steak was good, cooked perfectly with a decent sauce.\n\nnice selection of ad drinks yielded a 25 yo calvados that was a perfect ending.\n\ni wish i could have had my old standby, the <mark><mark>House Smoked Salmon Pizza</mark></mark>, but as a guest it wasn't on my list of options.\n\nservice started out a bit spotty, but got better as we settle in.\n\nwould probably only get three stars ordinarily, but i appreciate the fact that they are still in the same place serving quality food.", 
            "*amazing*\n\nfor my 30th birthday we ventured into spago for a fantastic night out and amazing experience.  finding a great restaurant in vegas is hand's down pretty easy...fantastic, gourmet, different...face it it's an easy task.\n\nour food was so fresh, the wine poured all night, the service was so welcoming and engaging.  i had the salmon, others at the table had <mark><mark>California Sea Bass</mark></mark>, tuna & filet special.  everyone had a clean plate.  we also had the seafood platter full of fresh oysters, shrimp, crab & lobster.  if that is a special don't pass it up!\n\nof course i was treated to a special \"happy birthday\" platter with a sparkling candle, which by the way doesn't blow out.  a fine, and classy way to end dinner.", 
            "excellent food and service.  had the raviolio and <mark><mark>California Sea Bass</mark></mark>. people in my party had the monk fish and scallops and they were great.", 
            "one of my favorite restaurants in vegas. hands down. the last time i was here, my friends and i ended up here twice because the food was just so good. this is the kind of food i love to eat. fresh, clean flavors, where you don't leave feeling like you inhaled grease for two hours. the service is impeccable, and the entire waitstaff is knowledgeable, friendly, and efficient. the wine list is superb, and we were never dissatisfied with our waiter-recommended wine selections.\n\nthroughout the two dinners we ate here, we tried the artichoke soup, the variation of beets, the chilled maine lobster salad, the raviolo, roasted chicken, <mark><mark>California Sea Bass</mark></mark>, dover sole, filet, lamb, and the duck. can you tell we loved the food? everything was perfection. there wasn't one single dish that met with a mediocre response from anyone. the artichoke soup was absolutely to die for and was perfectly creamy without being too decadent. the beets were out of this world as well, and i could eat them every day. i had the sole and <mark><mark>California Sea Bass</mark></mark>, and they were both delicate and melt-in-your-mouth with just the perfect amount of crunchy, silky vegetables underneath.\n\nfor dessert, we tried the chocolate cremieux, the peanut butter souffl\\u00e9, and one of the special desserts on evening, a strawberry consomm\\u00e9 with fresh pound cake and lemon sorbet. everything was outstanding, and even though were stuffed both nights, we managed a few bites of dessert each time.\n\ni am most certain that i will go back to spago each and every time i am in vegas in the  future. it is just that good.", 
            "i wanted to take my other half somewhere special for his birthday, but that somewhere had to be a place i could eat. i found spagos can and does happily accommodate food allergies  (in my case that means gluten free). we arrived early for our reservation and were promptly seated. i ordered a hurricane and the waiter recommended a samurai (whiskey cocktail) to the birthday boy. the waiter was very knowledgeable on the menu, he explained what i could order and made a couple recommendations. we ordered a <mark><mark>Spago Chopped Salad</mark></mark> to share, the birthday boy ordered the scampi and i had the <mark><mark>California Sea Bass</mark></mark> special both were fantastic. for dessert we shared a peanut butter souffle and a plate of small treats. all the staff we encountered were friendly and helpful, the food was delectable. all in all spagos made the evening a resounding success.", 
            "i have dined here before and always had a great experience so i decided to have dinner here on my birthday. it started out ok ,i was seated right away and shortly after i was greeted by josh(i think that was his name). he brought water(which he kept filled at all times) and he brought bread and butter, i remember other times having choices of bread and different kinds of olive oil. oh well, then my server comes(nicole) with attitude. i ordered the <mark><mark>Margherita Pizza</mark></mark> that was recommended on yelp, not that great. i was hoping to have the short ribs that were also recommended on yelp, not on the menu. now what am i going to have? nothing else really sounded that great. miss attitude offered a special for the evening which was <mark><mark>California Sea Bass</mark></mark>, i like fish so that's what i ordered. it wasn't that busy so i'm not sure why it took so long for my food to come out, luckily josh kept me entertained. the <mark><mark>California Sea Bass</mark></mark> was good, small but good. time for dessert, i love peaches so i was happy to see a fresh peach crisp on the menu. i was a little concerned until it came out because she kept calling it cobbler, i didn't want a cobbler i wanted a crisp. it was soooo tart. it didn't look right and it didn't taste right. now she comes with the check, wow $38 for that <mark><mark>California Sea Bass</mark></mark>. it was good but wow. with tip $100 for my birthday meal, not sure it was worth it.(dinner for 1) i will try them again but will check the menu before dining and hope for a server that doesn't have attitude.", 
            "best meal of my life. i can't even describe the experience i had here with words. this place earned 5 stars in every single way possible when i ate here last night. beautiful is the only word i can come up with to describe my evening here. \n\ni was dinning here with a large group for a business dinner with clients. i have an egg allergy which makes going out to eat difficult sometimes. to avoid the humiliation of asking the server a million questions in front of clients i had called ahead to see what was available to me to eat on the menu. \n\nthe hostess was very polite and then said she would direct me to the kitchen, she put me through to the head chef...at 5pm....on a saturday, already amazing and unheard of service. he was one of the most caring strangers i have spoken with on the phone and told me he would accommodate anything i wanted to order to my allergy.\n\nwe arrived for dinner and the server was already informed of my allergy. i ordered an amaze balls moscow mule and then the chilean <mark><mark>California Sea Bass</mark></mark> where the server carefully adjusted the entree to cater to my allergy needs. the food came out and everyone's entrees were stunning, and made for awesome conversation at the table. my bass was perfectly spiced, and honestly just perfect all around. \n\nwe got dessert and i had a bowl of fresh fruit, at this point the head chef actually came out of the kitchen to make sure everything was okay. he explained his wife has allergies so it always hits home for him. it was the best service i have ever experienced, and i think this type of gesture is unheard of and truly a rarity. \n\nthank you so much spago for turning a potentially stressful dining experience into an extremely elegant and awesome evening, you guys are the sh*t.", 
            "to be honest... i have been here a few times before i wrote this review. this review is relevant to my last visit and every previous one as well. \n\nsat on a tuesday in the dining room and enjoyed the tasting menu with three other people. warm welcome as i came in from two managers and the hostess. tip: if you like tastings, this one is $120 ... tell them that is what you want to do up front. you get vip treatment from the beginning (kinda like booking bottle service in the club). anyways, awesome greet. \n\nupon seating everything is really easy. you can do wine pairing or just order to your liking. we chose to do cocktails and order to everyone's likes, but the wine list looked awesome... maybe next time. \n\nfood was spectacular, my favorites being the tomato salad and <mark><mark>California Sea Bass</mark></mark>. presentation of every dish was original and with a purpose. artistic enough to cause conversation every course. the flavors that ensued caused all conversation to cease immediately. only smiles and moans ensued. \n\nservice was top notch. everyone who approached the table ( easily 10 different people spread out over two hours) knew their role and executed properly and with no pretentiousness and the perfect amount of personal. mickel was our point guy and was awesome the whole time. the executive chef even came by our table a few times to check on us... this really made the night special because you can tell he is super humble and appreciative of everybody who enjoys his food. he makes you feel like he prepares the dishes just for you and his only goal is to make you leave with a smile. \n\nthe entire meal was amazing and i can't wait to go back.", 
            "we had a nice experience here at spage. located inside caesars palace in the forum shops. \n\nmade reservations at 8pm and was given the option of fine dining or causal dining. which both had separate menus. we opted for the fine dining since it was date night. \n\nthe different kind of bread that we had while we waited for our dishes were very good. there was 4 kind and i took one of each. the cranberry walnut, some cheese bread, an apple bite bread and this swirly plain bread. the bread was cold. wish it was warm a little but its ok. \n\nwe also got a complementary amouse bouche. it was ginger squash soup. very tasty and a slight ginger kick to it. \n\nwe decided to order the lamb loin(medium rare, chefs recommendation) it was perfect! omg it was mouthwatering and didn't have that stinky lamb smell. it tasted like beef to me. \n\nthe other dish we ordered was the <mark><mark>California Sea Bass</mark></mark>. the skin was a little too salty for me. i think even my bf thought so too. came with shitake mushroom, apples and brussels sprouts. the sauce that it came with complimented the fish very well. \n\nfor complementary house desserts. we had the raspberry marshmallow and this other chocolate tart thing. both was made very good. was not too sweet as american desserts are known for.", 
            "came here for a team dinner. i'm disappointed at the food. very expensive and tiny portions. the <mark><mark>California Sea Bass</mark></mark> didn't taste good, it was dry and bland, the cream on it was really heavy. i didn't want to make a big deal out of it because it was a work event.", 
            "it's very expensive but the food was amazing. we got a salad, two appetizers and two entrees and our bill was about $130.  i recommend getting the cheese plate appetizer and the <mark><mark>California Sea Bass</mark></mark>. my girlfriend got the roasted chicken with mashed potatoes, which were also great.", 
            "i dined at spago again this week, just before the mariah carey opening night show  and was pleasantly surprised. i was told that in the last year they have changed the chef and menu.  i had a wonderful lobster salad followed by a <mark><mark>California Sea Bass</mark></mark> and it was wonderful. \"i'll be back\".", 
            "i had dinner here last week and it was fabulous. new menu, new chef and was most impressed. i had lobster salad and <mark><mark>California Sea Bass</mark></mark>. both were sensational. i will be back.",

            "this is my favorite restaurant in vegas. top shelf dining experience all the way, and, love the location in the forum at caesars. the shops, statuary, roman finishes, the ever changing sky and the scale of it all is so impressive. location, location, location as the saying goes and this venue is in a good one for sure. here for a sweet dinner date so for me pull out the stops and have some fun. a nice chardonnay, apps, excellent table service, braised duck and <mark><mark>California Sea Bass</mark></mark> entrees, and some beignets for ben on the dessert side. great experience and a bit further along the fire laden animatronics show outside cheescake factory is awesome!",

            "food: 3/5\nservice: 3.5/5\ncleanliness:  4/5\nprice: $$$\n\nyou can find the restaurant within minutes of entering the forum shops from the caesars palace casino entrance. the restaurant is relatively easy to spot because it has a bright neon sign that says wolfgang puck's spago. we arrived to the restaurant with no reservation around 3pm for a late lunch. \n\nwe were seated in their casual cafe dining area because it was lunch time. the dining room is only open for dinner starting at 5:30pm. there is also a nice bar available for casual drinks throughout the entire day starting at 11:30am.\n\nall dining tables were very clean with comfortable seats, crisp linen table cloths and napkins. we were seated immediately upon arriving because the restaurant wasn't too busy at that time of hour. when seated, one of the waiters welcomed us with the menus and served us with the water of our choice.\n\nwe ordered three things for ourselves:\n(1) truffled potato chips with maytag blue cheese fondue\n(2) garlic & <mark>Garlic & <mark>Garlic & Herb Marinated</mark> Roasted</mark> free range chicken (hubby)\n(3) <mark>House Made <mark>Bucatini Carbonara</mark></mark> with parmesan and crispy prosciutto (me).\n\nour appetizer arrived sometime later after we ordered, and at first, we weren't too excited about how the potato chips tasted. it didn't wow either of us, but we both agreed that it was getting addicting as we ate through our plate of chips. the blue cheese fondue was delicious, but we couldn't really taste the truffle in the chips. topped with some fresh parsley on top, the appetizer was worth trying but it's not something we'd order again. we will try something else next time!\n\nhubby's roasted chicken was delicious. there was no extra side served with the chicken, which hubby actually appreciated because he wanted to eat a little more healthy (ie. no carbs?) for lunch that day. the chicken was full of flavour; it was well marinated and the marinade itself was quite tasty! it was sweet, tangy, and savoury all at the same time, making you reach for seconds and thirds. hubby loved his dish, and i enjoyed it as well when i tried it; the dish was well balanced in terms of flavour! i'd order a side though to go along with the chicken.\n\nit was my first time trying bucatini, a thick pasta noodle that has a hole running through its centre. the portion of my carbonara was smaller than i expected, but together with the potato chips, it actually made me so full that i wasn't able to order any dessert. :d overall, my carbonara was good but not great. the prosciutto on its own was too salty for my taste, but it was balanced when eaten together with the bucatini. the pasta was some what bland without the prosciutto as well. maybe it was because i had a lot of the blue cheese fondue from my appetizer, but i ended up not really feeling the carbonara. when i ordered it, i was so excited, but after a few bites of my carbonara, i wasn't content with my dish like my hubby was with his chicken. i finished my pasta because i don't like leaving food behind, but the carbonara wasn't anything memorable in my opinion.\n\nall in all, our lunch at spago caf\\u00e9 was great but nothing incredible. then again, spago is more well known for its dining room and dinner service than anything else, so we may give the restaurant another try one day for its dinner. another reason to visit las vegas and the west coast again! :d\n\nthe restaurant is casually recommended, but it's not a must-go in our opinion so far. this may change at one point when we grab dinner at their dining room one day. if you're looking for a casual place to eat for lunch though, spago would be a great fit overall. it will provide you with good food, great service, and enough energy to get you going on that shopping spree!"

            "this really was a treat that i didn't see coming. we were trying to go to mesa grill, but it was pucking facked. so you can tell, i was feeling something big and beefy which probably colored my menu selections a bit. enough about me, more about spago. note they have 2 different menus depending on where you sit (cafe and dining room). we sat in the dining room. \n\ngroup of 3 of us arrived at about 7:30 on a thursday, no wait at all (kind of atypical in vegas!). we sat down, were served super promptly, and got  an amuse bouche of potato leek soup brought out right away. awesome. they have a couple gin oddities on their bar, so i got a gin martini. almost lost some points since the waiter asked if i wanted a lime in it (that would be a gimlet, not a martini). but whatevs. the martini was done very well...it had a remarkable floral scent to it quite a treat...try the cape rock organic gin. it was also $14, but that seems more the norm than the exception in vegas.  \n\ni had the most elegantly presented <mark><mark>Heirloom Tomato Soup</mark></mark> in the entire world.  the waiter brought a covered bowl to my table, lifted the top off, and there was a beautiful dense red soup with a pine branch drawn into the top of the soup using a olive oil/basil sauce. stunning. and the soup was great too...the crouton served with it matched perfectly. very very well done here.\n\nsince i was in a meaty/grilly mood (expecting to head to a flay joint), i got the kobe <mark><mark>Grilled Flat Iron Steak</mark></mark>. it was also exceptional. the steak was perfectly well done, nice and chewy (its a flatiron people, it should be chewy), but not tough at all. it was served with some broccolini which fit this dish perfectly. i'm only sorry i was too full for dessert.  \n\nthey brought out an assortment of bread in a basket before the appetizers, and i was having a tough time choosing between them since they all sounded great. after i made a tough choice for the bread i had selected, the waiter asked if i wanted something else. it was perfect - i was able to sample all of the breads that sounded great to me. he also came back 2-3 times during the meal to see if we wanted any more. also, our water glasses never got below 1/3 full. its weird, i've always wondered why the mid-high end restuarants typically don't have this kind of service, when you are clearly going to pay a fair chunck of change for dinner. its awesome to see a place that really aims to please you in every way possible. also, the wait staff was generally transparent during the meal even though they were doing a lot of work clearing our table, customizing cutlery, filling water, etc.\n\nthe dining area is perfectly decorated. its a little trendy, but not blinking red light and technoey. the decor is so right because you can walk in there wearing anything (ahem...within reason) and not feel out of place. its great for any age group - 20ish to 60ish. its a little loud, but not disruptivley so. you are going to have to pay a bit for this place (app, dinner, and a single martini ran me $100 after tip), but i'd do it again on my own dime in a heartbeat.\n\nits one of those rare 5 star places. well done sir puck."

            "honestly, this is probably my favorite restaurant in the world. i try to get to vegas once a year, and this is the one restaurant i always visit. the staff is very nice, and i love the atmosphere and the location in caesars forum shops. a table in the patio section, which juts out into forum is a great place to people watch. i always say i want to try the dinning room, where i've never been, but i just like dining in the patio section too much.\n\ni was there on a tuesday evening in june, 2010. i had the english pea soup, and the mesquite grilled new york strip, which came with zucchini, caramelized onions, bone marrow crushed <mark><mark>Tuscan Fingerling Potatoes</mark></mark> and armagnac peppercorn sauce. it was delicious, just like everything else i've ever had there. \n\nif you like it here, you may want to try the wolfgang puck bar and grill at mgm, a nice place for late night dining after a show.", 
            "spago by wolfgang puck, his signature restaurant in las vegas\n\nthe decor is modern with warm oranges and red color schemes.  the restaurant is expansive, with a second floor, a bar area and an \"outdoor\" seating area so you can people watch as shoppers walk by.  we were seated on the first floor in a little raised area where we were the first diners of the night to sit there yet still had amazing service.\n\nwolfgang puck is known for his amazing modern american cuisine and as a treat for ourselves, we went for the chef's tasting menu.  officially 6 courses, we ended up with what seemed to be 8 courses.  for $95, you get a lot of food while you could end up paying somewhere in the $30s for an entree.  chef eric klein did not disappoint with small portions of his most popular menu items for tasting with some items that weren't available for order on any menu at spago, lunch or dinner.   \n\nbread: as many reviewers have noted, spago's bread platter is well known for very good reason.  with four choices that night, sourdough, cranberry walnut, flat bread and foccacia, you could not go wrong with any.  dipping platter:  olive oil infused with rosemary, salt, pepper and butter.  the bread was very good as advertised, something that i tried to pace myself with knowing that i had the tasting menu to come.\n\namuse bouche: duo of american kobe beef \"sliders\" brioche buns, bread-butter pickles, red onions, smoked gouda, house made ketchup, chilled maryland blue crab salad fragrant herbs, avocado, grapefruit segments, lemon vinaigrette and basil pistou\n-melt in your mouth kobe beef, a perfect bite with the pickles providing just enough tang but the crab salad was what stole the show.  the grapefruit and lemon vinaigrette was unbeatable in cutting through the richness of the crab salad.  amazing bite\n\nfirst course: margarita flambe: mozzarella, fontina, parmesan, goat cheese with garden tomatoes and basil\n-crispy and flaky crust with an intense tomato flavor.  the flambe was good, something that didn't stand out too much at the end of the dinner, great contrast between the crust and the flavor of the toppings\n\nsecond course: duo of yellowfin <mark>Big-Eye Tuna Tartare & Sashimi</mark>: watercress salad, lychee, chive and aji limon and avocado, daikon radish, scallion and yuzu-wasabi\n-served in a perfect ice sculpture, the presentation was dramatic.  each sashimi bite had incredibly fresh seafood, the tuna being highlighted by the lychee and  by the yuzu, very yummy flavorful punches\n\nthird course: soup/salad: farmers' market cauliflower soup\ntrumpet royale mushrooms, arugula and basil oil olsen farm's baby arugula salad farmers' market apple, shaved fennel, burrata cheese, prosciutto san daniele, ice wine vinegar and olive oil\n-the soup was very creamy, had hints of potato but was made with pureed cauliflower, the arugula and basil oil was a great way to cut through the creaminess, very yummy with a great balanced salad.  the apple, fennel and cheese were complimented by the ice wine.  overall, great course\n\nfourth course: hand rolled, ricotta gnocchi with porrcini mushrooms, black truffle butter, cheese foam,\nthe best course of the night! there is no way to describe the pillowy, fluffy gnocchi, this course is not available anywhere on the menu day or night, it can only be had through the tasting menu.  the heartiness of the mushrooms with the black truffle butter, was insanely delicious, i could eat this dish every day for a long time\n\nfifth course: grilled french <mark><mark>California Sea Bass</mark></mark> loup de mer: artichokes, baby carrots, haricot vert, cipollini, arugula, fennel pur\\u00e9e, artichokes barigoule broth au pistou\n-perfectly cooked fish, flaky with a crispy crust.  the broth was something that could've been drunk without any accompaniment, very tasty and the accompanying vegetables were great for the fish.\n\nsixth course: mesquite grilled prime filet mignon: sweet & sour red onions, celery, watercress, bone marrow crushed <mark><mark>Tuscan Fingerling Potatoes</mark></mark> and armagnac peppercorn sauce pistachio crusted colorado lamb chops\ncheese on top of the lamb, pickled beets and onions with balsamic reduction\n-the lamb was tender, with the peppercorn flavor coming right through and the filet mignon was tender and tasty.  after all the big bold flavors in the past courses, the meat course was a little lacking but still very tasty if i had just had that course.  i was still hooked on that gnocchi.\n\npalate cleanser: blood orange and passionfruit sorbet over blueberries\n-yummy sorbet that had a touch of bitterness that did its job, cleanse your palate after that long meal.  i ate the whole thing, def not just a palate cleanser\n\ndesert: crepe: dark chocolate, hazelnut, creme fraiche with orange glaze\n-great crepe, with just enough body in the crepe to balance the hazelnute and dark chocolate\n\noverall, great attentive service, great food, was greeted by eric klein himself, would do it again in a heartbeat if i had unlimited funds, well worth the money", 
            "i expected dining here to be good, but i was happily surprised at how good it was.  the environment is clean and open.  they did not cram in a ton of tables so you do not feel like other people are all over you.\n\nwe showed up on time for our reservation and were sat promptly.  the hostess was very friendly.  we were immediately approached by one of our servers.  everyone who spoke to us, including the manager were great.\n\nwe started with the olsen farm's baby arugula salad.  the salad comes with bartlett pears, burrata, prosciuitto, vinegar and olive oil.  the flavors combined nicely.  it was a nice start to the meal.\n\nnext we ordered the pumpkin agnolotti.  i am not a huge pumpkin fan, but the flavors together were very good.  mascarpone comes on the side and the agnolotti comes with with parmesan and truffles.  the textures also blend well together.\n\nfor my meal i ordered the grilled prime beef filet.  the filet was prepared perfectly.  it comes with carmelized red onions, watercress, celery, <mark><mark>Tuscan Fingerling Potatoes</mark></mark>, bone marrow persillade and peppercorn sauce.  while the filet is clearly the focus, the other components add even more to the meal.  the filet is seasoned lightly.\n\nfor dessert we chose the peanut butter souffle.  it takes about ten minutes for them to prepare it, but it is well worth that short wait.  it is so fluffy, and filled with rich peanut butter flavor.  the lemon ice cream on the side seemed out to me, but they went quite well together.  our server recommended we add a shot of chocolate liquor to the bottom of the plate for even more flavor.  it stepped up the flavor even more.\n\nit was a pricey meal.  that being said, it is well worth it for the experience."
