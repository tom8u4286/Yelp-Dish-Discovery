            "it is time for me to write my review for sushisamba after all the times i have been to this location. the ambiance in the strip branch is pretty nice. you don't get to mingle with a crowd of people like in their dromo (miami) location but you still get to have a hell of a dining experience. the dining room is pretty dark almost like a nightclub, the music is loud and the drinks are strong. so all in all, this is a supper club.\n\notsumami is a must to have as a starter. the trio of shishito peppers, <mark>Green Bean Tempura</mark> and edamame is the perfect way to start over a round of caipirinhas.\n\nafter this you can do a round of robata. <mark>Filet Mignon</mark>, <mark>Lamb Chop</mark>, chicken, eggplant and <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>, they're all great and some of them come with the huge <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark> which are so tasty.\n\nas for the main course, i have tried their <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> entree which i loved until i had the moqueca. the moqueca is simply the best seafood stew i have ever had in my whole life. it is a medley of shrimp, squid, <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> and crayfish cooked in a pot with coconut milk and cashews.\n\ntop this with more caipirinhas and maybe a couple of their desserts from their expansive dessert menu and you'll have yourself a great dinner right before you head into an endless vegas night... you'll have a great dinner in a great ambiance with great music and on top of it you'll have a little bit of a buzz...", 
            "every year i go to miami for winter music conference i have been lured to go eat at sushi samba over on lincoln but i have never had the chance to eat there. not sure why. maybe it always seemed to packed and i didn't want to wait. i know now that i missed out on some damn good meals.\n\nright before thanksgiving my wife and my father in law traveled over to las vegas for a few nights. as we walked into the venetian hotel i saw a billboard for sushi samba at the adjoining hotel, the palazzo and i knew then where we were going for dinner. we went up to our room, freshened up and headed out.\n\nwe were quickly seated (it was a sunday night and the place was half full) and placed some drink orders. my wife had one of the specialty drinks which was quite good and i had some nigiri sake. we started off with the otsumami appetizer which came with edamame, shishito peppers and <mark>Green Bean Tempura</mark> with black truffle aioli. all 3 were excellent but we found ourselves fighting over the green beans and that yummy aioli. \n\nnext up was a mixture of ceviches and tiraditos. we tried 4 all together with both salmon and yellowtail. amazing flavor. the yellowtail ceviche taquitos were also amazing. i could eat those all day. we also had a couple of things from the robata grill. the stand out was the miso glazed <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>. it was incredible. so tasty. it was the best <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> i have ever had. period! the <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark> that came with it also was quite tasty.\n\nthe waitress recommended the mushroom toban-yaki with some grilled duck from the robata grill. it was so intense and earthy. i definitely got use of those umami tastebuds with this dish. loved every bit. after all that, we saved room for 2 speciality sushi rolls, the <mark>Samba Strip</mark> roll and the <mark>Neo Tokyo</mark> roll. both were amazing and filled with different flavors. \n\nall in all one of the best meais i have had in a while and i have had some amazing meals recently. if in vegas, you owe yourself. do it.", 
            "this restaurant is a chain and was pretty good.\n\nbeing a girls weekend away from home, we started off with their cocktail tree which is $70, but totally worth it! then we ordered otsumami which is an assortment of edamame, <mark>Green Bean Tempura</mark>, and shishito which was really good. their aioli sauce had a hint of truffles and a strong garlic taste but wasn't too over powering and made it really good with the <mark>Green Bean Tempura</mark>.\n\nafter that we had the <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark> that had bibb lettuce, tobanjan alioli, black truffle vinaigrette and in my opinion was only average. for my entree i had the miso-marinated chilean <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> and that was really, really good. very moist, tender, juicy and not fishy at all. it's everything you could wish your fish to be. the portion was a little small, but it was oh, so good!! i also had the <mark>Samba Strip</mark> roll which had <mark>Half Maine Lobster</mark>, mango, tomato, chive, crispy rice, soy paper, peanut curry and i thought it was alright. but for the price and how much lobster they gave us, it was really worth it.  the last thing i had was their <mark>Neo Tokyo</mark> roll that had yellowfin tuna, tempura flake, aji panca, which is also really good. \n\nmy overall experience was only a 3 stars because they said they were really busy that night (but didn't look that way to me because there were at least 5 empty tables in front of us) and they sat us in a corner and our waiter was a complete douche and couldn't get our order right nor could he remember what we ordered and came back on several occasions to reconfirm what we ordered. the manager there was also dumb and tried to help out only to make things worse because he asked us what we wanted to drink and didn't even bring our drinks and completely forgot about us. \n\nin the end, i'd come back cause the food was good, but hopefully i'll get better service next time.", 
            "thursday night. 9pm. \nour reservations were honored to the minute and the man who runs the show, mike durovsik, at once made us feel not just like welcomed guests but old friends.\n\nmy fiance and i were indulged with a 9 course specialized server's omakase. the food was superb, and the service exceeds even the best definitions of accommodating. \n\nour charming and attentive server asked immediately how adventurous we were willing to get, and since we had no objections to anything particular, our meal immediately commenced.\n\nfirst was the otsumami, three small dishes: <mark>Green Bean Tempura</mark> with a creamy truffle aoli dipping sauce (incredible), shishito peppers charcoal grilled and just the right amount of spicy, as well as edamame sprinkled with sea salt.\n\nnext came hamachi (yellowtail) tacos paired with a fizzing sort of vinegarette (spicy aji panca) on the side to top it off- this was filled with so much flavour it literally forced my eyes to roll back. a real treat that i'd highly  reccommend.\n\nat this point it was quite apparent that service and timing was top notch. the bottle of sake we brought was being chilled tableside and water never fell below the 2/3rds mark. as the bottle chilled we tasted two different cocktails-  kumori, a cucumber cocktail with shochu and nigori which was refreshing, easy, and delicious.  alongside was the ever popular nina fresa, a strawberry cocktail with vodka. both made for easy, yet yummy drinking.\n\ntheir mushroom toban yaki was divinely creamy- we got ours with bincho tan grilled lamb on top which paired quite nicely with those garlic chips. their were five different kinds of perfectly cooked mushrooms in the mix, and all around it made for a <mark>Uni</mark> filling appetizer. my fiances words: that fu**ing amazing lamb dish ;)\n\nthe sashimi tiradito i'm always raving about came next. still on a midblowing level, i noticed that their are different flavour notes (though served with the same ingredients) for the nyc location and the las vegas one. so if you think you've had it before, you haven't. though different, the fish is always immensely fresh and the taste accents are truly wonderful. my favorite is the kanpachi since i'm a sucker for yuzu (japanese citrus) and my fiance was a big fan of the hamachi- if you're torn, go with the assortment of all four and you won't have any regrets.\n\noff the robata grill (bincho tan charcoal) came the most decadant <mark><mark>Alaskan King Crab</mark> Leg</mark> imaginable- our taste buds were literally in shock from the mastermind talents of chef oscar toro. bedded atop rock salt, the crab was creamy, fell apart smoothly, and the flavours enhanced the entire piece of already fresh seafood. a seasonal dish that may not always be available... so wonderful. if they don't have it on menu, go for the spiny lobster.\n\nalso from from the robata grill we enjoyed the miso glazed <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> with baby corn. again, this dish can be done so many different ways at different high end japanese restaurants- but sushi samba's brazillian take really heightens the tastes.\n\nask for the freshest oysters of the day- you can go with <mark><mark>Osetra Caviar Imperial 20g</mark> 20g</mark>, paired with yuzu jelly and lemon, or a more contemporary take which chef oscar toro will create specially for that oyster.- both ways are unforgettable.\n\nmy absolute favorite dish is the kobe ishiyaki. you grill fresh pieces of perfectly marbleized kobe tableside 3-5 seconds on each side on an extremely hot river stone. you get 4-5 sauces and and array of salts to mix up the taste buds for you- absolutely the most decadently delicious dish. whenever i see this i must have it, and sushi samba's is the best i've had. not enough people indulge in this and you must must must!!! \n\nour sushi/sashimi platter was fresh and wonderful- exquisite. we got the <mark>Neo Tokyo</mark> and the <mark>El Topo</mark> rolls- <mark>Neo Tokyo</mark> has tuna and a bit of spicy to it, and the <mark>El Topo</mark> is served warm- a surprising aspect, but the melted mozzarella is such a <mark>Uni</mark> addition. it's like the movie \"<mark>El Topo</mark>\" you must try/ see both! \n\nfor dessert we went with mochi; a soft and chewy japanese dessert that is <mark><mark>Osetra Caviar Imperial 20g</mark> 20g</mark> not overly sweet. sushi samba adds ice cream to the center and offers all the best flavours. \n\nby the end of our meal and a finished bottle of sake, we were both more than pleasantly buzzed and satiated with an incredible meal. \n\n\n**************\nbottom line, if you are trying to decide between nobu and sushi samba, pass on nobu and put some samba in your seafood!!\n\nthank you again mike and oscar for such a wonderful night!!", 
            "bachelorette party of 12 girls. i called to make reservations and they informed me on the phone that with a large party of our size, we would need to do a set menu. they said that the waiter would work with us on the day of to put together a menu to work around any restrictions we had. \n\nwe were running a little late (you can imagine how that can happen with1 2 girls) so i called to let them know and they were very nice and accommodating. they said not to worry and that they would hold our table for us. we arrived at the restaurant and were seated at a big table in the back of the restaurant (the restaurant is pretty big). the table itself was huge and we had plenty of space between the 12 of us.\n\nso, between the group of 12, we had the following restrictions: one pregnancy, allergies to peanuts, shrimp, and shellfish. the waiter asked us what amount we wanted to keep it to and we told him to keep it around $50/person. we ended up with the following:\n\n+otsumami assortment of edamame, <mark>Green Bean Tempura</mark>, shishito - all delicious. the dipping sauce had truffle in it... who doesn't love truffles??\n+berkshire pork gyoza - pretty good gyoza. wasn't a big fan of the pumpkin dipping sauce..\n+yellowtail taquitos - delicious! \n+<mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> anticucho and chicken anticucho - the <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> was amazing (as everyone else has already mentioned). it is so buttery and melts in your mouth.\n+a ton of sushi rolls and some sashimi - pretty good... i would say their strength is in more of their cooked food than their sushi and sashimi. i always prefer sashimi over rolls because the rolls are usually too fusiony for me but the other girls loved them\n+<mark>Rio Grande</mark> churrasco - 5 diff meats with 3 diff dipping sauces. very good but so full that we couldn't eat much\n\nservice was great. we informed our waiter that we needed to be out the door by 9:30 pm and he made sure that the food just kept coming. by the end of dinner, we were so stuffed that we couldn't even eat all of the churrasco and had no space for dessert. we even came under budget by a little bit and were all way overly stuffed. \n\nfood was pretty good... but more than anything, it's a fun atmosphere that's good for groups. would definitely go back with a large party.", 
            "i've been here several times, and the food keeps me coming back. i love the concept (japanese, brazilian, and peruvian fusion), and the atmosphere is definitely trendy. food is amazing. service tends to be a hit or miss. not too sure why they let their hosts wear flats and flip flops to work either in a multi-million dollar vegas resort... just saying.\n\nmy favorites from the menu:\n- <mark>Green Bean Tempura</mark> w/ truffle aioli (i love truffle)\n- shishito peppers\n- mushroom toban-yaki\n- veggie kun roll\n- <mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark>\n- shiitake mushroom w/ hijiki <mark>Seaweed Salad</mark>\n- coconut soup for dessert. a savory, light, well-balanced dessert\n** before i gave up meat/fish, my faves were the miso-marinated chilean <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>, <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> roll, and <mark>Organic Chicken</mark> and smoked teriyaki skewer. i didn't forget about you guys!\n\nif you want excellent service, request dayn as your server. he is on point, very knowledgable about the menu, and very attentive. did i mention very courteous?", 
            "i had an amazing dinner here for my bachelorette party! i've been to sushi samba in miami & was happy to be back. the vibe is very upbeat with a club feel & the food is a <mark>Uni</mark> fusion of south american & japanese...who would of thought?? our server was matt & not only was he attractive but he was kind enough to serve us a penis cake with sparkler candles...awesome! we heard about their \"secret\" prix fix menu here, so we decided to go with it. our server asked us a bunch of questions about our preferences & food allergies to gage what type of menu we would receive. it didn't matter because everthing they served us was absolutely great.  here is a run down of what we had: \n\n-<mark>Green Bean Tempura</mark> (light & crunchy) \n-shishita peppers (could eat a pound of these everyday) \n-pork gyoza (savory with a wonderful sweet potato puree underneath) \n-yellowtail sashimi (so fresh with a lovely sauce underneath) \n-lobster taco (good but doesn't knock my socks off like the others) \n-<mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark> (ummm...so good cant even begin to describe) \n-chilean <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> & chicken teriyaki skewers served with <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark> (<mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> was like butter, chicken was ok, couldn't stop eating the corn...think corn on steriods) \n-rolls (we got a variety, don't remember exactly but they were all very fresh) \nthat basically sums up our heavenly experience at sushi samba. our bill was pretty hefty after all was said & done. but it was totally worth it....i will be back! this time sans penis cake ;) thanks matt!!!", 
            "sushi samba is the best it can get! the chef's tasting menu is the way to go. i can't even fully describe how amazing everything we had was. we started off with the edamame, shisito and <mark>Green Bean Tempura</mark>. the shishito are seared and roasted peppers, which were spicy but good. the tempura was amazing with this black truffle alioli that i wanted to drizzle on everything!\n\nthen came chicken gyoza, which was so tender on top of pumpkin puree. before we knew it they were bringing out rolls, one tuna and one with fresh crab. i was starting to feel full, when all of a sudden came the miso <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> and beef tenderloin skewers. they were served with this <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark> that i haven't been able to stop thinking about since.the kernels are the size of quarters!  and i didn't even get to mention the nice cocktail list until now, so you know the food was good.\n\nall in all it was one of the best meals i've had in a really long time. they also had a similar sized spread for my friend who is a vegetarian and graciously agreed to go with us.", 
            "4 stars for the dessert and tempura green beans.\n\neverything else was meh.\n\nordered the <mark>Samba Strip</mark> roll which came with a little lobster tail and had mango in it.  it was average.  the peanut curry sauce i wasn't a fan of as it tasted like ginger and i was not feelin it.\n\nbut the star was the dessert...banana honey crispy taquitos.  they have a caramel sauce on top and chocolate on the bottom. amazing\n\nand the <mark>Green Bean Tempura</mark> is served with black truffle aoili.  i yelled so loud the table next to me ordered it.  it was a very \"when harry met sally\" moment \"i'll have what she's having\"", 
            "japanese/brazilian fusion is an intriguing concept.  the good: <mark>Green Bean Tempura</mark> with black truffle aioli, antichuco tenderloin with <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark>, and warm banana chocolate pie.  as far as sushi rolls go: just because you combine a bunch of flavors together doesn't necessarily make them tasty.  the <mark>Alaskan King Crab</mark> roll with pear was downright odd.  it was served with some type of avocado crema that was not complementary to the crab.  everything overpowered the fish, in fact i'm not even sure if the roll contained fish.  a green envy roll advertised a wasabi pea crust that i thought would give it crunch. negative.  just a light dusting to give the roll yet again an odd flavor.  if you enjoy more <mark><mark>Osetra Caviar Imperial 20g</mark> 20g</mark> sushi this will not satisfy the craving. however, for light appetizers and drinks this makes for a good spot.", 
            "we celebrated my birthday this year at sushisamba and it was exceptional. the best way to enjoy the menu here is to ask the waiter order the food for you. \n\nif you give them a set $$ amount that you want to spend they really stay within that figure and help you enjoy a variety of their dishes. more than you probably would if you tried to attempt on your own. \n\nstarting off the meal was a trio of veggie dishes including <mark>Green Bean Tempura</mark> with black truffle oil. happiness. we all loved that and ended up dipping everything we could into the truffle oil.\n\nfor the main course we had a selection of 5 different meats with a variety of dipping sauces including two types of chimichurri, one red and one green. the red had more of a vinegar flavor to it. different than <mark><mark>Osetra Caviar Imperial 20g</mark> 20g</mark> still delicious.\n\nsides included collard greens and <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark>. \n\nas a last course we were given 3 large cut rolls of sushi including the <mark>El Topo</mark>. a must if you want to experience salmon and crispy onions together. very different and quite delicious. \n\nobviously we had cocktails as it was my birthday, so my sister and i both ordered the chu cumber \"chu-tini\" and it was beyond. anything with elderflower in it is refreshing and light and makes me want to jump on a plane to the most lazy, tropical destination possible.\n\nthe waiter also threw in a sparkling (literally) coco duo dessert for my birthday. \n\nservice was great and we were all a very happy group by the time we headed out to see jabbawokeez!!", 
            "this place gets packed & reservations are strictly a must, on the weekends (especially holidays).\n\n5-stars for excellent service!!!  we were there last friday w/out a reservation, so the guy behind me cut right in-front of us & the host escorted him to his table (he turned around & laughed in our faces).  this is a 50+yr old man acting like a 5yr old.  in our 30's & 40's...we were way too mature to say anything back.  a really nice asian lady-host (very attractive) approached me & offered to do her best to slide us in if any of the tables became available.  five-minutes later i get a call to come-back quickly because she found a way to squeeze all six of us in.  ironically it was next to the 5yr old mentality man...lol!!!\n\nanother 5-stars for the menu!!!  i love asian-fusion cuisine & this place has a pretty large menu.  we were a moderate size group, so we tried almost everything on the menu.\n\nour consensus on likes are as follows:\nsawagani\n<mark>Green Bean Tempura</mark>\n<mark>Seaweed Salad</mark>\ntiger <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark>\nyellowtail seviche\n<mark><mark>Jumbo Shrimp</mark></mark> seviche\n<mark>Broiled Peruvian Bay Scallop</mark> (robata)\nanticuchos\nmiso-marinated chilean <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>\nsamba rolls (pacific)\nsamba rolls (<mark>Rainbow Dragon</mark>)\nsamba split for two (dessert)\nmochi (dessert)\nhousemade ice cream & sorvete (dessert)\npisco sour (cocktails)\nchicha sour (cocktails)\nsamba juice (cocktails)\n\nthe general manager (partner) came out to greet us, which was quite interesting.  our tummies were full & our faces were happy.  definitely coming back!!!", 
            "man, i love this place. i should have reviewed it sooner, before i decided that i was going to only eat vegetarian on tuesdays (and mondays, and wednesdays. argh!). ah, such is life.\n\nbut, the great news is, they do have delicious vegetarian options! i quit drinking and even their mocktails were mouthwatering! i had the watermelon mojo and really felt like having no alcohol was a-ok! it was so sweet and so watermelon-y. they could have just kept filling my glass up, but thinking about the sugar content gave me pause. so, i had one. it was all i needed to know that their mocktails are fab!\n\nfor appetizers we ordered the otsumami. it was good a combination of edamame, <mark>Green Bean Tempura</mark> and shishito and i couldn't stop eating it! really perfect size for a group (unless you have someone like me who hoards it for themselves, then, problems). the green beans were like never ending. i put one in my mouth and then another and another, breaking every now and again for the shishito, which is sweet (but spicy) peppers. man, i could have eaten that for days. \n\nthis time we just ordered two rolls. because one wasn't vegetarian i didn't partake, but as with all things sushisamba, it looked delicious! the other was the veggie kun and it was really great. the flavors blended nicely (there are a lot of ingredients in this roll) and sort of melted in my mouth. i would highly recommend. i also wish they had more vegetarian options, though this was plenty at the time.\n\nthis is my second time here, the first time i had the yamato roll. holy. i was a huge fan of <mark>Foie Gras</mark> at the time and to have that on a roll was so decadently delicious that it, right then and there, became my favorite sushi roll ever. i won't ever forget that, ever. \n\ni know vegas is known for a lot of really great ayce sushi places, but if you want something that transcends those and gives you a more cultured, elegant, tasteful experience, you can do no better than sushisamba.", 
            "this is one of my favorite places to eat in vegas and now a must-visit when i'm in town. everything that i've had on the food and drink menu is delicious! i would highly recommend the <mark>Green Bean Tempura</mark> to start off with. and the samba rolls, which are their latin-asian fusion sushi selections, are great culinary combinations. as others mentioned, it is a little pricey, but i think it's totally worth it. i would highly recommend making a reservation in advance if you plan on going. they can get very very busy.", 
            "on the saturday of my bachelorette party, my girlfriends treated me to dinner at sushi samba.  it was a fabulous, memorable meal, where we ate well and celebrated in style.\n\nwe were staying at the palazzo, and sushi samba was the perfect venue for the occasion.  it was convenient to get to in heels, and the atmosphere was festive, edging on clubby without being obnoxious.  we had a big comfortable table, and service was excellent.  i wish we'd gotten the name of our waiter - he did a great job attending to our every need, and he guided us through the whole dining experience with expertise.  (for management - he was a tall guy who served a party of nine on 6/29.  you know, your only bachelorette party of the month?)\n\nwe ordered cocktails, which were pretty good.  i had a blame it on rio, a caipirinha variation with cacha\\u00e7a, agave syrup, fresh lime juice, cucumber, and jalape\\u00f1o.  it was both cool and spicy, and it went down really easy.  the classic caipirinha was also great, with just the cacha\\u00e7a, lime, and sugar.  i also tried some of the chu-cumber, a shochu drink with hendricks gin, elderflower liqueur, and muddled cucumber - very refreshing.  at some point, we got a complimentary cocktail tree, a beautiful iron tree bearing shot-sized wine glasses on every branch.  they held some frothy, sweet version of a screwdriver that was great for the occasion.\n\ndinner was delicious.  we had the option of ordering a la carte or omakase, and we decided to keep things simple.  we specified a price point and listed dietary restrictions, and the food just started coming.  it was all served family style, and everything was well portioned for our big group.  we left full but not overstuffed - a plus, since it had taken a team to stuff me into my white dress for the night.  the cuisine was fun, a creative, unforced fusion of japanese and peruvian styles.\n\nfirst, we had a trio of vegetable otsumami, all served together in a lovely green array.  there was the staple edamame with sea salt and lime, and <mark>Green Bean Tempura</mark> served with a rich black truffle aioli.  my favorite of the three, though, was the handful of shishito peppers.  these were grilled blistering black, polished with sea salt and lemon.  they were pretty irresistible.  next we got a tray of japanese a5 <mark>Seared W<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> Beef</mark> gyoza.  these were great, thin-skinned and stuffed with luscious hunks of beef rather than the usual mince.  they came with kabocha pumpkin pur\\u00e9e, a sweet soy drizzle, and a su-shoyu dipping sauce.  the best thing i ate all night, though, was a crispy taquito overflowing with yelllowtail, avocado, and roasted corn miso.  the shell was thin and crunchy, and the fresh, tender fish was just right with that avocado, miso, and some thinly sliced vegetables.  the taquitos were served with spicy aji panca sauce and fresh lime - that piquant, frothy sauce was just the icing on a beautiful fusion taco cake.\n\nafter the smaller plates were done, we moved on to big platters of sushi and sashimi.  i do not remember everything we got, as there were at least six or seven rolls and even more kinds of sashimi.  the rolls were great, a nice mix of california standards - you know, the mix and match of eel, yellowtail, tuna, etc. with avocado, cucumber, and dots of mayo - and more samba-specific stuff, with the stray <mark><mark>Alaskan King Crab</mark> Leg</mark> and lobster claw.  i particularly liked the <mark>Samba Strip</mark>, with <mark>Half Maine Lobster</mark> tempura, mango, tomato, chive, soy paper, and a coating of crispy rice.  it was unusual and flavorful, served with a peanut curry.  the rest of the platter came with a sweet thick soy sauce and a bit of mayo.  the sashimi was more traditional, served on a bed of ice.  it was hard to share, as there was only one of each kind, but the slivers i had were great.\n\nthe most filling part of the meal was the churrasco course.  we got two hefty platters of the <mark>Rio Grande</mark> with three meats, grilled hanger steak, ribeye, and chorizo.  these were great, juicy and tender and full of that hearty grilled meat flavor.  they came with a trio of dipping sauces - malagueta pepper oil, chimichurri, and a third that is infuriatingly absent from the menu.  we also had some sides of rice, beans, collard greens, and a medley of <mark>Roasted Seasonal Vegetables</mark> - giant corn kernels, toothsome brussels sprouts, carrots, celery, pearl onions, and more.  we also got miso-marinated chilean <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> a la carte, with roasted organic vegetables and oshinko.  this was a winner - the fish was moist, flakey, and shot through with miso flavor.\n\nwe were full by dessert, but loved the complimentary chocolate mousse, served with a sparkler and a congratulatory message.  the lush mousse came topped with crunchy chocolate pearls, whipped cream, and a little bit of candle-stuck banana.  we each got a sweet bite to end our wonderful dinner.\n\nin conclusion, my friends are the best - thank you girls for this weekend, and for this fun, delicious meal.  sushi samba was an a+ choice, worthy of a night i won't soon forget.", 
            "planned a 12-person dinner celebration here for a bachelorette party over labor day weekend and couldn't have been happier with the choice! \n\nsushi samba was great from the get-go. we emailed them to see about their pre-fix ordering menu for bigger parties, and their events coordinator got back to us immediately with all the important details.\n\nthe night of our reservation, my friend and i arrived at the restaurant early with some requests for our dinner. the hostess brought out the manager and our waiter to speak with us directly. both accommodated us perfectly in our requests for pre-ordering drinks, finding an ideal price-point for our group, and making sure the menu suited our needs. \n\nwe were seated in their backroom at a great big table. our waiter was extremely friendly without being overbearing. we ordered the family-style meal and asked for options on the lighter/fresher/fishier side of things. all items we got were awesome-- they hit the nail on the head with our requests: \n\n<mark>Green Bean Tempura</mark>, <mark>Tuna Tataki</mark>, ceviche tacos, terriyaki fish skewers, a wide variety of sushi, edamame... and even more! they also made special plates for one of the girls who didn't eat raw fish. bonus points right there!\n\nat our price point (about $40/per person before tax and tip) we had plenty of food and even extra left over. splitting everything family style made for a really fun evening and made splitting the check extremely easy. \n\ni would definitely recommend this place to anyone planning a party. now i just have to check out sushi samba in chicago!", 
            "in las vegas as well as other big restaurant/entertainment towns, good food is expected but in las vegas it sometimes does not fully compare to chicago and ny.\n\nhowever, the one place i finally went to was sushi samba and what a great surprise.  i tend to avoid sushi in several places when traveling unless in hawaii and some parts of ca and japan.  sushi samba had some of the best dishes i have had and the quality was great.  they have a variety of menu items with small plates and full entrees.  they do some <mark><mark>Osetra Caviar Imperial 20g</mark> 20g</mark> but mostly more interesting variations as well as the s american dishes.  some of the items were:\nrock fish\n<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark>\n<mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark>\n<mark>Green Bean Tempura</mark>\n<mark>Berkshire Pork Belly</mark>\n<mark>Moqueca Mista</mark>. seafood coconut milk and rice with green onion\nyamato sushi roll(maguro, fois gras, <mark><mark>Osetra Caviar Imperial 20g</mark> 20g</mark>)\nuni shushi outstanding \ngreat sake list\n\nall the fish and shellfish were fresh and well prepared.\n\nit gets busy so we ate at the bar and the service was excellent there.  luna and maria can help with picking some great dishes at the bar.\n\nit is on the higher price side but worth it compared to a lot of other places where the food doesn't always live up to the expectations in vegas.  looking forward to next trip back there.", 
            "must must take my bf here the next time i go. so yummy!! \n\nthe restaurant was very casual with spectacular food and fantastic wait-staff. our waiter suggested he choose a tasting menu according to our party size (keeping in mind the 1 girl who couldn't eat raw fish) and our budget ($50 per girl). smartest thing we did entire trip!! upon hearing we were there for a bachelorette party, a free round of shots!\n\nthe standouts were the <mark>Green Bean Tempura</mark> with truffle aioli, <mark>Seared W<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> Beef</mark> gyoza and <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> skewers. but the yellowtail seviche tacos with chili foam sauce stole the whole damn show. yum. \n\nnot so yummy turned out to be the rolls, but we just packed it up and brought it for the girls in the hotel room that were recuperating from the night before. they thought it was delicious. i think we were just full by then.", 
            "i love sushisamba! i was very familiar with the london location and this was actually my 2nd visit to the vegas location. the food never disappoints at either venue and if you are new to the brand i would recommend having the server either order for you or working closely with them to craft your own \"tasting menu\".  the concept of japanese, peruvian and brazilian can be intimidating and unfamiliar to most but you have to just go with it! \n\nwe let the manager, jason p, order for us and we couldn't have been happier! he was super friendly and asked about any allergies and dietary restrictions and got everything on point. we had an assortment of small plates: <mark>Green Bean Tempura</mark>, edamame, pardon peppers, a <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> roll, some <mark>Crispy Hokkaido Scallop</mark> lettuce wrap, assorted taquitos of yellow tail / lobster / crab and <mark>Mushroom Tobanyaki</mark> with <mark>Duck Breast</mark>. everything was cooked and seasoned perfectly and the staff even made a point to let us know which items to eat first to enjoy at the best possible temperature. everyone we encountered was friendly, engaging, knowledgeable on the menus and so hospitable! \n\nto sum it up, jason p and the whole ss team know what they're freaking doing and i can't wait to go back!", 
            "we checked out this place over the weekend for a girlfriend's bachelorette celebration, and had a fantastic time.\n\ni don't remember our server's name, but he was very attentive, patient and focused on providing the best possible experience. we had a vegetarian in our group, and he was kind enough to tell us about the vegetarian options and even provide a vegan menu for us to explore. my only quip would be the restaurant's \"set your own price & we'll customize the menu \" option - when we heard about it, we were immediately enthusiastic and decided to set a $25 per head price. unfor<mark>Tuna</mark> the server told us that the restaurant wanted a $50 per head minimum for that option... seems a little strange to me. \n\nwe ended up ordering off the a la carte menu, which was fantastic. we opted for:\n\nseared ahi <mark>Tuna Tataki</mark>: yum! each slice of seared ahi tuna was served atop a spinach leave and with a delightful sauce. absolutely delicious. i could have made a meal out of this dish alone (if i didn't have to share...hehe).\n\notsumami - blistered shishito peppers, edamame and <mark>Green Bean Tempura</mark>: we originally planned to order a standard edamame bowl, but we followed our server's recommendation to order this instead. so glad we did! the dish was a perfect portion for 5 hungry people. a few in our group hadn't tried shishito peppers before, so they were absolutely wowed. the tempura was decent - not mindblowing by any standards, but definitely not oily or soggy like some other tempura variations.\n\nlima roll: this roll was fantastic. i like tempura shrimp when it's not in sushi, and this roll definitely changed my mind on that - it was absolutely delicious.\n\namazonia roll: our vegetarian friend loved this roll. it's wonderful that sushisamba has this option, since the <mark><mark>Osetra Caviar Imperial 20g</mark> 20g</mark>, sweet potato and cucumber rolls can get a little boring for our herbivore friends.\n\nsao paolo roll: my personal favorite! extremely delicious. such an amazing combination of flavors and textures. \n\nsomehow, we all had room for dessert and opted for the mango tres leites cake. it was served with a dollop of mango ice cream and a matcha green tea dipping sauce. overall, a truly delicious end to a fantastic meal. i can't wait to visit the sushisamba in new york!", 
            "one of my all-time favorites in las vegas!  sushisamba is a must every time we pay a visit to sin city whether it's for lunch, dinner or a midnight snack.  easily accessible through the grand canal shoppes entrance closest to the wynn.  i do agree with some of the other reviewers in that this place can be pricey... but you're in las vegas... what did you expect, $13 sushi buffet?  no thanks.\n\nmy favorites here:\n-<mark>Purple Potato Mash</mark>:  so delicious and buttery-good.  great side to even share with others at the table\n-<mark>Green Bean Tempura</mark>:  comes with a really tasty aioli that trumps all other tempura associated sauces\n-<mark>El Topo</mark>:  my favorite of the sushi rolls hands down.  so <mark>Uni</mark> with crispy onion and mozzarella and incredibly melt-in-your-mouth good salmon.\n\ndrinks are always good here. personal favorite is the nina fresa - a light, refreshing and tasty strawberry martini.  can't go wrong with any of the cocktails though.\n\ndo yourself a favor - come, eat and enjoy."

            "we came to sushisamba for my birthday dinner a few days ago and i was blown away by the food! it definitely exceeded expectations.\n\nthe menu was so overwhelming we didn't know where to even begin and while our waiter didn't really help us narrow things down, he did make some good suggestions and helped us pace out the meal so we can order as we go. he came with the manager, who was very nice and gave us birthday shots, and also asked that we let him know if he could do anything. \n\nhere's what we started with: shishito peppers combo (grilled shishito peppers, tempura string beans with a truffle aioli, and edamame), <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark> in a spicy mayo sauce, <mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark>, and <mark>Crispy Hokkaido Scallop</mark> lettuce wraps. the peppers were a good surprise of the night because i didn't expect it to come with the string beans and edamame, but i definitely appreciated the greens in vegas! the <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark> was really tasty, but i wish it was a little crunchier when it came out. they tasted a bit soggy as if they were sitting in sauce for too long, but no complaints because the flavor was still there. the <mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> was good, but nothing really mind-blowing in my opinion. the <mark>Crispy Hokkaido Scallop</mark> lettuce wrap was phenomenal. our waiter said it was a new item on the menu and suggested we try it and it really blew us all out of the water. \n\nwe followed up the first round with the robata - we got the <mark>Berkshire Pork Belly</mark>, rib eye, <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>, and duck. all of them were so good, so make sure you pay a visit to the robata section when you visit! the duck and the rib eye to me stood out more than the others - they were cooked very well and had a good mix of <mark>Uni</mark> flavors.\n\nwe finished off dessert with their 4th of july special (red velvet cheesecake, frozen blueberries, and white chocolate ice cream) and sadly we were underwhelmed with what came out. i think we were so blown away by the entire meal, we felt like dessert was going to continue the streak, but were left wanting a bit more. either way, we were so stuffed it didn't matter and the dessert didn't take away from how much we liked the meal itself.\n\nwhat really set this over the edge is that the chef came out to shake our hands and chat with us really quickly, which i really appreciated! the service was great, the recommendations were on par, and the food was delicious. i would definitely recommend this spot for a special occasion - go ahead and gorge!!",

            "it would've been 5 stars but the waitress was bitchy at first!\n\nbeing a huge sex and the city fan, i had to go to this place.  the decor is captivating and the lighting is perfect.  red is the dominant hue of the restaurant and it is so pretty.   the location in ceasars is kind of hidden so we stumbled upon it.  we went at the perfect time, right around 3 or 4 and it was not busy.  however, the place got packed!  they decided to put a row of 6 or 7 tables extremely close together so you feel like you are having dinner with complete strangers on either side of you.  you can hear their entire conversation, by the way.  just entirely too intimate for me.  \n\nour visit started out kinda rocky.  our waitress lacked time management skills and/or waited on the other tables hand and foot because she thought they would give them a bigger tip, maybe? dont know!  all i do know is that we sat there for 25 minutes with nothing more than a hello.  so after compaining to another waitress she finally came around.  while we were ordering, our server was more than eager to answer all of my hyper active, anxious and indecisive friend.  \n\nthe menu is a combination of pervian, brazillian and asian fusion.  oooooh so divine!  it was so hard to decide on what to choose.  we finally decided on sushi and <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>, <mark>Miso Soup</mark> and <mark>Seaweed Salad</mark>.  the miso is delicious but i've had better.  my friend ordered the red wild mushroom and truffle miso.  it was sooooo delicious!  but, the <mark>Seaweed Salad</mark> is a must have to veggie lovers.  seaweed has a distinct taste of it's own but it is sooo friggin good!  i was so pleasantly surprised.  when to food arrived, i was like a kid in a candy store.  i cannot remember what sushi i ordered but one of them the best ever!  as expected, the food is expensive.   between the 2 of us, it was well over $100. so don't go here if you are trying to save money.  if you do just order the tapas on the left side of the menu.  but, you will still be hungry.\n\ni loved this place.  with the exception of the servers lack of time management skills at first, this was one of my favorite visits on this trip.  i will be going back!  i love sushi samba!!!!!!!",

            "maybe it's because i've enjoyed many a meal at the sushi samba locations in nyc, and maybe because i was a little hungover from the previous nights festivities, but i was not overly wowed by lunch here with two of my lady loves with whom i was vacationing. \n\none thing that is always a priority on vacation is food. it has to be, this is a break from the mundane life i leave behind, so why do i want to eat my standard weekly fare of life in the working world? i love sushi and because of it's nutritious nature figured this would be a great way to replenish all things lost to bottomless cocktails and greasy late night foods. i didn't partake in the consumption of any libations at lunch, but did hear that the mojito was pretty stellar.\n\ni ordered the trio <mark>Seaweed Salad</mark> that came beautifully presented on a three trayed dish of hijiki, wakame, and my favorite aka-tosaka. each were lightly dressed with lemon and sidelined with some tomato caviar. not terrible for a $11, but not overly substantial either. for lunch i ordered <mark>Yellowtail Jalapeno</mark> which was ok if not a little heavy on the jalapeno, and a <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> that was all sorts of bland. i think i would have been happier enjoying these as a happy hour because it seems that the prices are a little easier to swallow for the quality of the food. i didn't order anything complex, and maybe they just let the \"easy\" stuff slide, but i wasn't terribly enthused enough to want to go back and give it a second shot to see just how good the rest of the menu is according to the higher ratings given.", 
            "came here to grab dinner on a random day.  no special occasion.  my friend and i found the service average, the decor strange/ugly, and the food interesting/questionable.  it's supposed to be a japanese/brazilian fusion place.  i can see this place being a real pleaser for people who are not familiar with authentic japanese or brazilian food.  being japanese with a sister-in-law from brazil, i found myself qualified to test the food out.  i think the only dish i got that i found myself satisfied with was the edamame....but it's pretty much impossible to mess edamame up.  my 7 year old niece can make it blindfolded.  \n\ni recognized that things might be bad from the start with the <mark>Seaweed Salad</mark>.  wow was it awful.  nice presentation but no flavor!!  it was so watered down that i couldn't even taste the seaweed itself.  i might as well have eaten gelatin with no flavoring.  it was that bad. \n\ni also got the red miso.  it was mixed with truffle oil and mushrooms.  i did not find the truffle oil mixed with the <mark>Miso Soup</mark> appetizing at all....the flavors just did not mesh for me.  \n\nthe sushi was a bit too fusion for me....i found the flavors to not really complement each other.  i did order regular tuna sashimi just to get something with no fusion and more japanese authenticity....the tuna quality was excellent but woah overpriced!  $4.50 for one piece of sashimi.  it was good but not that good.  the ramen was ok...nothing to talk about later.  \n\nas you can tell, we were not impressed.  we ordered an array of things expecting for something to blow us away, but we were disappointed.  $80 later, we headed home and looked for something on the way to satisfy our appetites.", 
            "second time here and have to say both times were great. we sat at the bar and our server was super cool. loved the <mark>Seaweed Salad</mark> which was a trio of three kinds of seaweed, the yellowtail sashimi was so fresh and the sauce excellent.  expensive? yes, but that's no secret.", 
            "i cant believe i forgot to tell everyone just how much we liked  sushisamba..  it was a seafood and sushi lovers delight.   we've eaten sushi all over the world,  but sushisamba really stays in our minds.  i can still see my <mark>Seaweed Salad</mark>,  (so good),  and those <mark>Rainbow Dragon</mark> samba rolls,  that we devoured before our main course,  a plate so large,  we split it two ways!   it think it was called  <mark>Moqueca Mista</mark>,  something like that,  that included shrimp,  squid,  <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>,  to die for!   it has been a couple months and i can still taste that seafood,  prepared perfectly....  the atmosphere was nice,  so was my company.   we had a great meal,  we definitly will make  sushisamba our first stop on our next trip to vegas!   worth every dime!!!!",

            "in early may i was in las vegas on business and wanted to entertain some colleagues for dinner. we were a party of eleven and with that many pallets to please, we needed something different, we needed sushisamba. \n\na couple people in the group had been here before and spoke highly of the fusion restaurant, but for many of us this would be our first time so we made a reservation for 7pm. typically when we travel for business there is always one or two people who join your group at the last minute, so we held a table for thirteen just in case. \n\nmost of us arrived to the restaurant on time however two people were running a few minutes late but on their way. unfor<mark>Tuna</mark> because we were not a party of ten, the server refused to seat us, even though it would only be a few minutes for them to arrive. she also said they could only hold our reservation for 10 minutes.  needless to say, they arrived in time, but i thought that it was not only a poor business decision to seat us early (most people will enjoy a cocktail or two while waiting) but just rude. \n\nwe were seated in the far back of the restaurant and the servers were very attentive. they quickly explained the brazilian-peruvian-japanese fusion concept of the restaurant and then without missing a beat he began to pitch us on the \"chef's choice\" option to the menu. i will admit, it was a good pitch, but obviously too good to be true. with this option the chef would listen to our likes and dislikes and create dishes that appeal to our tastes based on our budget, much like when dining at a chef's table.  the catch to this.... the restaurant was packed, there is no way the kitchen is creating anything special for us.... they're just serving menu items that will maximize your budget and increase your check. \n\nsadly five of us fell for it and ordered the \"chef's choice\" menu, the rest of us ordered ala carte and decided we would share plates amongst each other and asked for separate checks.  funny enough most of the plates that were being served off the \"chef's choice\" menu were the same plates we ordered, but with a few exceptions.  the food was good.  it by no means blew me away, but nothing i ate was bad and i really cant find anything negative to say about it. we had a number of small dishes that included edamame, <mark>Seaweed Salad</mark>, rock shrimp and <mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark>, plus an assortment of sushi rolls. \n\nthe checks came and as expected the \"chef's choice\" total was nearly $100 more than the ala carte (and we had an extra person).  i signed the bill, put the receipt in my wallet and didn't look at it again until i got back to the office and had to submit my expenses. \n\nas i reviewed the bill i took notice to the quantities of the plates ordered. we specifically ordered different items knowing that we were sharing, so i was surprised to see that i had duplicates on five items. i know we all liked the rock shrimp and ordered another plate, so that wasn't a concern. however there was only one other questionable roll that no one recalls ordering and the other three were definitely not ordered, delivered or consumed.... but we paid for it. \n\nwe aren't talking about a lot of money here - $36 - $55, but it's the fact we were obviously taken advantage of.  maybe the waiter wanted a bigger tip, perhaps the restaurant wanted to recoup some funds because we didn't take the \"chef's choice\"? either way i wrote the management group letting them know of my disappointment.  in the end i got an email from the general manager offering to return my $36 with an apology. \n\n\nas a chef, when i am dining out i expect my experience to meet an acceptable level of expectations that may differ from others, however lets face it, with so many choices available these days a restaurant has to be spot on to keep you coming back.  apparently in this case sushisamba needs the money more than i do as i will not be going back.",

            "i came for a bachelorette party last week on friday night around 11pm. my review is probably (ok definitely) biased because i was in such a bad mood at having to wait until 11pm to eat dinner. however, as you might imagine, 5 girls using one bathroom getting ready to go out in vegas is a production equal to cirque de solei that takes upward of 3 hours. but whatever we finally made it after a 15 minute, mile long cab ride down the strip from the cosmo to the palazzo hotel.  the restaurant was super dark (why don't they turn some lights on?) with huge tvs which were super loud. per the usual at many \"sceney\" type restaurants you could barely here the people across the table from you. \n\nwe got seated no problem as the restaurant was dead except for two or three big groups getting wasted in booths and a few lonely looking stragglers at the bar. our server was friendly but seemed to constantly be in a rush, although to go where i do not know. there seemed to be a ton of bus boys but very few wait staff. he could probably sense our frustration so he promptly brought out a wrought iron tree full of pink drinks. whether or not they had liquor was the only question (answer: not enough.) so we got a range of drinks, the best of which was a cucumber lime martini with vodka. after the night's beginning, i opted with straight vodka and diet coke.\n\nfor food we got a lot. some  memorable dishes were the <mark>Neo Tokyo</mark> roll with tuna which was solid, <mark>Heirloom Tomato Salad</mark> with sweet cilantro dressing, <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark>, <mark>Mushroom Tobanyaki</mark>, and sweet <mark>Coconut Rice</mark> side. my fave dish of all was the <mark>Heirloom Tomato Salad</mark> which was pricey but enough to share between 3 people. the rock shrimp was good but cliched, same as you would get anywhere else. the <mark>Mushroom Tobanyaki</mark> was interesting but not to my taste.  sadly we did not get dessert. \nin conclusion, i can definitely say i hope i will never be back with another bachelorette party, although i would not mind returning otherwise.",

            "i was really excited about coming here after reading some of these reviews. this is gonna be a long one, please hang in there. \n\nreading about the omakase experiences was what got me interested. i'll spare you the details on the interior. (aunny d. explained it perfectly) the place is just fricken nice, beautifully decorated and the perfect hang out spot. they hired very attractive hostesses that were extremely friendly. the service we received from our waiter and the staff was simply awesome. \n\nnow for the food.....\n\nwe had a party of 5 and our original plan was to order both <mark><mark>Osetra Caviar Imperial 20g</mark> 20g</mark>($100) and the sushi samba omakase ($80). after going through the menu, we decided to order up a variety of items rather than go with the omakase. this way, you end up getting food that would be in the omakase anyway, more food (omakase 7 -course), and for less. \n\n\"small plates\" and \"seviches & tiraditos\"  (<mark>Grade A5</mark> a to f)\n\n<mark>Tuna Tataki</mark>  - (c+) chef overuses tatsoi that practically kills the dish\n\nseared kobe beef -(f) just not worth it. mushrooms overwhelms it\n\nchicharron de calamar - (a) excellent and generous amount!\n\nsashimi seviches - (b) grapefruit juice, jalape\\u00f1o, almond + \npassionfruit,  cucumber, cilantro \n\nsashimi tiraditos - (d) yellowtail jalape\\u00f1o and lemongrass + salmon orange and mustard miso\n\nsushi is obviously the trendy thing to have on a restaurants menu. sushi samba serves up some of the most below average sashimi and sushi. for $33, we had the <mark>Samba Sushi</mark> and sashimi combo. the sashimi was nice and thick.  both salmon and yellowtail were quite good, but the tuna was poorly prepared and lacked any freshness. the sushi was a complete joke. you get a small wafer thin slice of sashimi on a rabbit dropping sized glob of rice. most japanese restaurants, for any combo sushi plate, give you two pieces each - tuna, salmon, and yellowtail. sushi samba gives you one. my whole table thought this was a complete joke and ripoff. it doesnt end here....we ordered 4 different rolls. guess what? they're all puny and only have 4 pieces averaging $10-$20 each. we also ordered the 5 hand roll special ($28) which was okay, but the soy wrap just doesnt work. \n\nnow here's how we felt that the chefs were completely lazy or inexperienced. the sushi rice had no vinegar flavor and that is a must for sushi rice. plus, they used old rice because we had some hard dried pieces in our rolls. overall, i would not waste any money on sushi here. it's a complete insult to customers. \n\nour final dish was the 5 meat churrasco: grilled hanger steak, ribeye, pork tenderloin, chorizo, ling\\u00fci\\u00e7a with malagueta pepper oil and chimichurri.  - this dish was fantastic. the meat, cooked medium, was tender and juicy. (a+)\n\nnow, we had a total of about 16-17 items of various things off the menu. more than double than what you'll get in a omakase.  we had about 5 bottles of japanese beers. our cost  per person was $92 with tax and tip included. (5 people) \n\ni would love to come back just for the atmosphere and the churrasco. its simply a cool place to hang out and drink. dont come here for the japanese food. go to a real japanese restaurant for the omakase. just seeing how the sushi, sashimi, and rolls are prepared makes me question the chef's experience in preparing a true omakase.  \n\nif you actually read this whole thing. thanks!", 
            "i agree with an early reviewer that sushi samba is a pretty nice date place.  the first time i went to sushi samba was back in early august, and my date and i tried the calamari appetizer with plantains and that was tasty.  the big hit of the night though were my nina fresa cocktails and the chocolate fondue.  they were absolutely fabulous! the nina fresa cocktails were nice and fruity and gave me a helluva buzz. ;)\n\ni enjoyed the ambiance of sushi samba so much that i went a second time with my girls during labor day weekend and we were seated in the dining area that later transformed into sugarcane boutique lounge after 11 pm.  our sexy latin waiter, jaiver, was very nice and oh-so-hot too! he was very helpful in explaining to us about the different dishes.  for appetizer, we went with <mark>Tuna Tataki</mark> which was melt in your mouth good! then, for entree, we tried the brazilian churrasco, which was very good too, particularly the dipping sauces that went with the meats.  oh yes, we also ordered the cocktail tree which was awesome! all in all, sushi samba was very nice.  i also love the brazilian/latin infused house music that played while we were dining.  i would definitely go back again!",

            "oh lord, this review is a toughie to write.  sushi samba is a <mark>Uni</mark> restaurant in that it's a blend of japanese, brazilian and peruvian influence, and we had so many different flavors and samplings of things, this will be quite a mixed review.  \n\nthey definitely anticipate people being unable to choose from the wide-range of items on the menu, so they actually give you the option of letting the waitress put together your order based on likes, dislikes, preferences, food allergies, and based on price, etc.  we spouted out... \"salmon!\"   \n\n                \"tuna!\"  \n\n\"spice!\"        \"allergic to shrimp!\"    \n\n                 \"jalapenos!\"  \n\nso, the waitress brought out the following:\n\n(1) edamame with sea salt and lime.\n\nsmall plates:\n(2) berkshire pork gyoza (kabocha pumpkin pure\\u00e9 and su-shoyu dipping sauce) - very good! the pumpkin puree is a nice touch!  just be sure to scrape it all off the plate when you pick up the gyoza!\n(3) <mark>Tuna Tataki</mark> (white asparagus, fresh heart of palm, avocado, tatsoi, citrus soy) - this is seared tuna, marinated a bit in vinegar and ginger - also very good. i have never had tatsoi before - but it is quite good! tastes and looks a bit like spinach but is better!\n\nseviches:\n(4) salmon asparagus, red radish, pineapple, lime - quite good! 2nd fave of the four seviches.\n(5) yellowtail jalape\\u00f1o and lemongrass - our table came to the consensus that this was the winner of the 4 seviches.  perfect amount of spice from the japaleno, and just a bit of tang from the lemongrass - goes very well together with the hamachi! very good!\n(6) tuna granny smith apple, serrano, lime - i did not like this one - the apple taste is awful in my opinion... pass.\n(7) the last one had a very <mark><mark>Osetra Caviar Imperial 20g</mark> 20g</mark> seviche taste - lemon, lime very simple, and good.  the type of fish they used escapes me now.. apologies.\n\nrobata:\n(8) <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> and miso anticucho - <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> pieces marinated with delicious miso on skewers - so good. the fish is very fresh and tender - and the miso is light, but very tasty!  it also comes with <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark> kernels - which if you haven't had it - each kernel is about 5 times the size of a normal corn kernel, and is a bit meatier. yum!\n\nlarge plates:\n(9) toban yaki organic mushroom, charred green onion, garlic chips, kobe beef! they split this in two bowls - which was strange because one bowl was better than the other. not sure how much i liked this dish - the sauce was very heavy/creamy yet bland and lacked something. the other bowl had more tang to the sauce and was better - inconsistency - not good!  mushrooms were yummy though!\n\nsamba rolls:\n(10) el toro (salmon, jalape\\u00f1o, shiso leaf, fresh melted mozzarella, crispy onion): the fave of the bunch yet still not that great seeing as how it doesn't really \"count\" as sushi - melted mozzarella? come on.\n(11) <mark>Neo Tokyo</mark> yellowfin tuna, tempura flake, aji panca - this was a disappointment! the waitress called it the \"ultimate <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark>\" - but it was not spicy whatsoever.  she mentioned that they use a fresher version of tuna - not so when you order <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> elsewhere (where they use the leftover bits of fish and mash it up). meh, pass.\n(12) veggie kun avocado, tomato, arugula, oshinko, yamagobo, wasabi nori flake, tofu miso - pass! tastes fresh but dude - where's the fish!? \n(13) can't remember this last roll because i was so full and couldn't have anymore!!!\n\nthis was so much food - 70 per person. i'd pass on the rolls, and go for samplings of their other small dishes, seviches, skewers! 4 stars.", 
            "what is there not to love about brazilians?\n\nbrazilian bbq, brazilian wax, brazilian models, and brazilian fusion.\n\nsushi samba is ahhh-mazing. i honestly thought the bf was overhyping the place and thought it would be mediocre, but i was surprised by the quality of the food and how delicious everything was!\n\nour waitress regina was nice and very bubbly. she made our dining experience at sushi samba great. instead of ordering random items off the menu, we chose the personalized prix fixe menu. basically, you tell your waiter/waitress what you like/dislike and the price limit per person and they basically bring out items that they think you would like.  if you don't like it, the waiter/waitress takes full responsibility for it and doesn't charge you. \n\nbetween the 3 of us, we had:\n- edamame: i'm not a fan of edamame so i rarely eat it and don't really care for it.\n- yellowtail crispy taquitos: this is a cold dish and it's like a sushi taco. the taquito had lemongrass, avocado, and aji panca miso. definitely recommend it!\n- <mark>Tuna Tataki</mark>: also another cold dish. very light and it had white asparagus, heart of palm, avocado, tatsoi, and citrus soy. i love anything with tuna in it so i enjoyed this a lot. \n- mushroom toban yaki w/ <mark>Filet Mignon</mark>: omg delicious! this came in a stone pot and had a bunch of <mark>Mixed <mark>Wild Mushrooms</mark></mark> and <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> in a delicious broth. \n- sashimi tiradito (yellowtail, kanpachi, tuna, and salmon): i didn't care too much for this dish. it was good but some of the sauce that accompanied the sashimi didn't blow me away. the yellowtail had a jalapeno and lemongrass sauce, the kanpachi had a yuzu, black truffle oil, and sea salt sauce, the tuna had a yuzu soy, hickory oil, and toasted garlic sauce, and the salmon had a maiz cancha, lime zest, and ponzu sauce. \n- <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> w/ a side of <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark>: this had to be one of the best <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> i've ever had in my life. it was cooked perfectly and had the perfect buttery, melt in your mouth texture. it was also marinated in a sweet sauce, but it wasn't too overpowering. the side of corn complemented the <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> very well.\n- <mark>Neo Tokyo</mark> roll, carnival roll, <mark>El Topo</mark> roll - i'm not the biggest fan of rolls and these rolls were a bit disappointing. especially since it came out last after all the really delicious dishes. i tried each of the rolls, but they weren't memorable.\n- carrot cake: oooooommmmmmmgggggggg! best carrot cake, ever. it was served with brown butter ice cream, cinnamon cream, rainbow carrot chip, and orange reduction. i seriously wanted to lick the plate after i was done!\n\nthe total per person (not including alcohol, tip, or tax) was about $65/per person. totally worth it! \n\nif you ever decide to try sushi samba, skip the rolls and go for the good stuff! i definitely recommend the personalized prix fixe menu.",

            "my dining experience fell short of my expectations considering what we ate (or shall i say what we didn't eat) compared to what we paid. there were 21 of us for dinner and we had the chef's selection, also known as omakase. typically, you would get the most innovative dishes ordering this style.  however, we were served typical menu items.  i think it was just a strategic way for them to serve a larger group without having to cater to individual orders. \n\nthe good was that most of the items we tasted were pretty good. the bad was that we weren't given enough food to taste everything, even though we were all charged the same price.  \n\ninstead, we shared each plate of food between 5-7 people, which included the following: \n(1) <mark>Tuna Tataki</mark>: only got to try it because someone didn't eat raw fish. \n(2) <mark>Seared W<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> Beef</mark> dumplings: not enough brought out so i never got to try it. \n(3) mini yellow tail tacos:  i liked the spicy foam which added a nice kick to the citrus-ey flavors of the dish. \n(4) crab tempura: how ridiculous is it that there were only several pieces to each order so the hubs and i had to share one bite of one piece? this wouldn't even qualify as an amuse-bouche. \n(5) <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> and shrimp skewers: again, not enough so most of us shared skewers. \n(6) steak and mushroom stew: everyone got 1-2 thin slices of beef, which was tender and flavorful. \n(7) sushi rolls/sashimi: the sushi rolls were the most generous items served (about 5 cut rolls) but imo were rather underwhelming. the sashimi, on the other hand, was delicious and fresh. we were given about 3 slices each of yellowtail, tuna, and salmon which i easily could have eaten by myself.\n\ni felt bad for the hubs because he was still hungry and asked what was being served next, only to be told that it was just dessert followed by a $2500 bill ($240 per couple). \n\nyes, our server was pleasant and friendly. yes, the food was quite tasty.  and, yes, they need to recalculate the amount of food for groups ordering from the chef's selection. sure, i expected to pay a lot for this kind of meal, but what i didn't expect was to leave unsatisfied and wanting for more.",

            "we checked out this place over the weekend for a girlfriend's bachelorette celebration, and had a fantastic time.\n\ni don't remember our server's name, but he was very attentive, patient and focused on providing the best possible experience. we had a vegetarian in our group, and he was kind enough to tell us about the vegetarian options and even provide a vegan menu for us to explore. my only quip would be the restaurant's \"set your own price & we'll customize the menu \" option - when we heard about it, we were immediately enthusiastic and decided to set a $25 per head price. unfor<mark>Tuna</mark> the server told us that the restaurant wanted a $50 per head minimum for that option... seems a little strange to me. \n\nwe ended up ordering off the a la carte menu, which was fantastic. we opted for:\n\nseared ahi <mark>Tuna Tataki</mark>: yum! each slice of seared ahi tuna was served atop a spinach leave and with a delightful sauce. absolutely delicious. i could have made a meal out of this dish alone (if i didn't have to share...hehe).\n\notsumami - blistered shishito peppers, edamame and <mark>Green Bean Tempura</mark>: we originally planned to order a standard edamame bowl, but we followed our server's recommendation to order this instead. so glad we did! the dish was a perfect portion for 5 hungry people. a few in our group hadn't tried shishito peppers before, so they were absolutely wowed. the tempura was decent - not mindblowing by any standards, but definitely not oily or soggy like some other tempura variations.\n\nlima roll: this roll was fantastic. i like tempura shrimp when it's not in sushi, and this roll definitely changed my mind on that - it was absolutely delicious.\n\namazonia roll: our vegetarian friend loved this roll. it's wonderful that sushisamba has this option, since the <mark><mark>Osetra Caviar Imperial 20g</mark> 20g</mark>, sweet potato and cucumber rolls can get a little boring for our herbivore friends.\n\nsao paolo roll: my personal favorite! extremely delicious. such an amazing combination of flavors and textures. \n\nsomehow, we all had room for dessert and opted for the mango tres leites cake. it was served with a dollop of mango ice cream and a matcha green tea dipping sauce. overall, a truly delicious end to a fantastic meal. i can't wait to visit the sushisamba in new york!", 
            "absolutely delicious! we went with a large group and they offer tasting menus - which would have been a good idea but we had a lot of different sushi favorites so we all ordered separately. \n\ni started with a <mark>Tuna Tataki</mark> appetizer that may have been the best i've ever had. the tuna was perfectly seasoned and seared. my mouth started drooling thinking about it. i wanted 10 more pieces. \n\ni then had a roll but i cannot for the life of me remember the name. it was slightly tempura but delicious. great size as well. \n\ni went for a bachelorette weekend and they gave us two free cocktail towers which was extremely nice. \n\noverall very great experience here. we stayed at the venetian so the location also helped!"

            "i had the chance to go back this past weekend and got a completely  different experience the second time around at sushi samba. \n\nafter a fun filled weekend adventure in vegas, we decided to give ss another shot. it was my cousin's birthday, and we figured we would stop by for a farewell vegas-birthday dinner. we stayed at the venetian, which made ss a stone throw away. we couldn't have came at a better time, the environment was so much more personal than the time before. i highly recommend avoiding peak dining hours if possible. this will give you time to enjoy your meal while getting some extra attention from servers. since we arrived at around 4pm on a sunday, the timing was perfect. \n\nour party grabbed a couple dishes and shared them all. this was the perfect way to sample everything. we started our mission into japanese/peruvian/brazilian adventure with...\n\notsumami: a mix of three appetizers. edamame, fried green beans, and grilled shishito peppers. my absolute favorite was the shishito peppers. they were doused in sea salt and lemon, and one out of every couple were spicy. perfect mix to the subtle hues of the edamame. \n\nyellowtail seviche: little tiny tacos filled with a mixture of yellowtail, onions, avocado and a side of chile sauce. these little babies packed a flavorful punch!\n\nnext up was the smoked <mark><mark>Alaskan King Crab</mark> Leg</mark>: wood fired, served in the half shell, perfectly cut and smothered in a signature sauce. these were so delicious and just melted in my mouth like butter!\n\nround four, <mark>Broiled Peruvian Bay Scallop</mark>: served in the shell as well, perfectly cooked. you can tell that they know how to prepare their seafood because everything tasted so fresh. this was my cousin's favorite dish and her first time ever trying <mark>Scallop</mark>. \n\nthen came out the <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark>. we could hardly eat anymore, however we asked for the most flavorful, scrumptious items, and intended on finishing them! after that, the yellowtail sashimi. it had spicy blended orange sauce on it, that was the perfectly paired with the fish. my personal fave of the night. \n\nmake sure to order a signature cocktail while you are there. we had a couple (after all, what kind of birthday is complete without drinks?), and the one that really stood out was the chu-cumber. it was like you were drinking the most exquisite cup of tea mixed with the cool tones of cucumber, all while getting a little buzz on. \n\nmy taste buds are so happy that i gave sushi samba another shot. the best part was, management remembered that it was my cousin's birthday, and brought out a little slice of carrot cake with ice cream and sparklers crowning the top. it was definitely a birthday dinner that we will all remember.", 
            "my friend wanted to celebrate her tax return and take me to lunch (hooray for me!!) she wanted to have sushi on the strip, well mostly all the sushi restaurants on the strip don't open until dinner, except sushisamba, so that's where we landed.  while we waited for them to open, i was scoping yelp reviews to see what we should order. the <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark> seemed to be the #1 suggestion, so that's what we started out with.  neither  one of us were impressed, sorry to say, but i felt like i was eating just a giant piece of corn kernal. but it was all uphill from there. \n\nour server, drago, was very attentive and full of suggestions, he had asked if we dined here before and i told him i had been to the one in miami, then he said he would bring us something on the house for coming back. when i tell you, you must order these, i'm not exaggerating, they were excellent, not on the menu, <mark>Broiled Peruvian Bay Scallop</mark>, prepared differently than the one on the menu. they were so good we had to order another round. i am a huge fan of yellowtail, so we ordered the yellowtail taquitos, so tasty, i loved the crunch that the mini taco shell added to the yellowtail flavor. next up was a table favorite as well, <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> miso, it melted in your mouth.  i was skeptical at first, they are served on a skewer, so i wasn't expecting the amazing flavor i tasted when i took my first bite. drago suggested the <mark>El Topo</mark> roll, both of us like hot,, super spicy food, this roll had a nice kick at the end, i normaily don't like any kind of dairy on my sushi rolls, i.e. cream cheese, etc....but this had melted mozzarella, it was excellent. then came the grand finale, my friend is a huge kobe beef fan so she wanted to try the <mark>Seared W<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> Beef</mark>, excellent <mark>Grade A5</mark>5, ishi yaki hot stone, dipping sauces, vegetables. presentation was so nice, lots of different sauces to try.  dessert, yes we still had room for dessert, we tried the peruvian hot chocolate con cr\\u00e8me served with <mark><mark>Osetra Caviar Imperial 20g</mark> 20g</mark> and the coco duo dark and white chocolate custard with praline. the second one was by far the best. a must. also try the house made iced tea, they mix fresh orange juice, lime juice and lemon with black tea.....think i drank a pitcher of it.  good food, service, ambiance!", 
            "this place gets packed & reservations are strictly a must, on the weekends (especially holidays).\n\n5-stars for excellent service!!!  we were there last friday w/out a reservation, so the guy behind me cut right in-front of us & the host escorted him to his table (he turned around & laughed in our faces).  this is a 50+yr old man acting like a 5yr old.  in our 30's & 40's...we were way too mature to say anything back.  a really nice asian lady-host (very attractive) approached me & offered to do her best to slide us in if any of the tables became available.  five-minutes later i get a call to come-back quickly because she found a way to squeeze all six of us in.  ironically it was next to the 5yr old mentality man...lol!!!\n\nanother 5-stars for the menu!!!  i love asian-fusion cuisine & this place has a pretty large menu.  we were a moderate size group, so we tried almost everything on the menu.\n\nour consensus on likes are as follows:\nsawagani\n<mark>Green Bean Tempura</mark>\n<mark>Seaweed Salad</mark>\ntiger <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark>\nyellowtail seviche\n<mark><mark>Jumbo Shrimp</mark></mark> seviche\n<mark>Broiled Peruvian Bay Scallop</mark> (robata)\nanticuchos\nmiso-marinated chilean <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>\nsamba rolls (pacific)\nsamba rolls (<mark>Rainbow Dragon</mark>)\nsamba split for two (dessert)\nmochi (dessert)\nhousemade ice cream & sorvete (dessert)\npisco sour (cocktails)\nchicha sour (cocktails)\nsamba juice (cocktails)\n\nthe general manager (partner) came out to greet us, which was quite interesting.  our tummies were full & our faces were happy.  definitely coming back!!!", 
            "first of all... amazing!  if you're okay with tapas style, paying a little more for a good meal, and willing to have fusion-y food... this place rocks!  the non-sushi plates are all worth trying... but our favorites were: japanese a5 <mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark>, yellowtail taquitos, the <mark>Broiled Peruvian Bay Scallop</mark> and the melt on you're mouth <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>! \n\nyes... this is a pricey joint, so maybe try the dishes that seem safe to you first, but everything we tried was simply amazing...that said, the sushi itself may not be anything too special, but the fusion items are totally worth every cent! \n\nmy suggestion: check out the menu beforehand so you have an idea of what to start with... as with all fusion foods, the descriptions are essential :)  \n\nof note: all the staff was helpful and friendly and intent on service...if you're lucky enough to get isabella... trust her!  her suggestions were all on point!", 
            "this is my favorite restaurant in las vegas. the chilean <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> 10/10 is the most scrumptious skewer of tender fish and it literally will melt in your mouth. \n\nthe <mark>Broiled Peruvian Bay Scallop</mark> garlic style (not on the menu ask for this!!!) are also not to be missed.\n\nexcellent sake selection, and they will also reheat your bottle for you if it gets lukewarm.\n\nthe yamato roll 10/10. served with <mark>Foie Gras</mark> - i just wish there were more than 3 dang guess i gotta order seconds.", 
            "everytime i stay at the palazzo, i must eat at sushi samba.  although it's definitely on the pricier side, it's really worth the money.  and hey, you're in vegas, and you can't be cheap in vegas.  when ordering, you have two options: order off the preset menu or let the chefs create a sampling for you at the price you want.  because this restaurant is a fusion of mainly japanese and brazilian, they have many different chefs creating many different things.  although i tried both, i prefer choosing from the preset menu. this way i don't get something i don't particularly enjoy.  \n\nout of what i've tried so far, my favorites are the s\\u00e3o paulo roll, the <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> antichucho, and the garlic butter <mark>Scallop</mark>.  the s\\u00e3o paulo roll is a wonderful combination of <mark>Scallop</mark>, tuna, salmon, yellowtail, shrimp, red onion, masago, avocado, truffle (!!!), and chive oil.  the <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> has a miso glaze and comes with <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark>.  the <mark>Scallop</mark> are a bit more special because they aren't on the menu.  but they're basically their <mark>Broiled Peruvian Bay Scallop</mark> on a half shell, smothered in this delicious garlicky butter reduction.  can't wait to come back and try some other things on the menu!", 
            "it is with great sadness i give sushi samba two stars; one star is for new york and one for miami.  las vegas samba was a big fail. i must preface we came for a lunch which went swimmingly, the complimentary <mark>Broiled Peruvian Bay Scallop</mark> were the caliber of the best french restaurants of paris.  great service great experience.  hence our decision to come for dinner.  making a dinner reservation is useless, you wait an hour any way.  only to be greeted by a snotty receptionist making arrogant comments about having to wait.  to add insult to injury, the waiters are over worked and under trained.  placing an empty water glass and not filling it for 15 minutes and not brining sake that was ordered  upon seating another fail.  always bring the alcohol.  people will overlook almost anything if they are drinking.  i spoke to the manager and i recommended giving the receptionist the \"how to win friends and influence people\" training since she lacks any skill in that area.  the waiter needs training as well.  i will not hold it against new york or miami.  they rock.", 
            "what a way to celebrate my 21st birthday. after this experience i can only hope to have the opport<mark>Uni</mark> to come back year after year to celebrate just as perfectly.\n\nnot only was the food and drink world-class, the service and attention was deserving of 5 stars alone and both the servers and manager truly made this a special and memorable meal and experience.\n\nwe had 6:30 reservations but we arrived and were seated about 15 minutes early no questions asked and the night took off from there. \n\ni started the night with a brisa caliente cocktail: a conservatively spicy blend of tequila, ginger, fruit juices and chili in a rimmed glass with a shimchimi, a deliciously spicy japanese chili. although only a few days into the legal realm, i think i'll have a favorite drink for a long time coming.\n\nmy father and i split a number of dishes, including:\nspicy tempura rock shrimp: incredible array of flavors and textures. i've had similar dishes from local japanese fusion places and nobu and sushisamba's by far surpassed the competition. priced a little less with a more substantial portion, i could have been okay ordering a few of these.\n\nyellowtail and w<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> \"taquitos\": taquitos in the sense these two-a-piece small dishes were served in a mini crispy wonton-taco, the spicy aji panca sauce was drinkable by itself but added a level of sophistication that totally elevated the dish. i prefered the yellowtail over the w<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> mainly as the flavor of the fish was able to shine more than the beef. that said the beef was still really, really good.\n\n<mark>Broiled Peruvian Bay Scallop</mark>: served on the shell, these reminded me of a \"<mark>Scallop</mark> rockefeller\" of sorts, and the lime-butter crust was crispy and buttery. i'm glad they were <mark>Broiled Peruvian Bay Scallop</mark> versus their larger, more flavorful cousin since the crust was overpowering but as a single bite it was great.\n\nmiso chilean <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>: my favorite of the night, the two-skewer dish is completely melt-in-your-mouth with a perfect salty-sweet sauce. definitely the best non-<mark><mark>Osetra Caviar Imperial 20g</mark> 20g</mark> i've ever had. may be a little pricey but the flavor is just really, really good. this came with the <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark> which is now my all-time favorite vegetable...large kernels with a crazy good flavor.\n\n<mark>Sao Paulo</mark> samba roll: we were tempted by the gluttony of this everything-but-the-kitchen-sink roll and it was pretty awesome. it was a little much in the sense it's hard to differentiate everything inside, but the sauce on the side added an indescribable flavor that made it special. the roll comes with scallop, masago, red onion, tuna, salmon, shrimp, yellowtail, avocado, truffle, hacho miso soy, chive oil. wow.\n\n\"chef's inspiration\" sashimi platter: i'm a sucker for really good fish. that means i can be pretty picky, too. the platter came with 9 pieces, 3 each of sake salmon, akami tuna and yellowtail tuna. salmon included, the fish were so fatty (in the good way) and melt-on-the-toungue my father and i both were just blown away by the quality of raw fish from a restaurant which fuses japanese, brazilian and peruvian alike. \n\nraspberry sorbet w/ green tea coating: not sure what we were getting ourselves into with this, but the sweet white chocolate (?) and green tea ganache/candy-like coating paired with the super smooth and perfectly-sweet sorbet was the perfect end...and i don't generally choose fruit desserts.\n\n--\nall in all, i really cannot find any flaw in this place. i could only guess fewer-star ratings are attributed to a bad day or something because sushisamba has easily entered its way into my top 5 restaurants of all time...not an easy task. again i experienced wonderfully attentive service, great food, amazing cocktails and ended the night full and happy. not much more i could have asked for. thanks for an awesome birthday!", 
            "lunch at sushisamba is the best!  we were promptly seated at a round table with a good view of the whole restaurant.  the restaurant energy is vibrant, full of energy and colorful.  we ordered 2 orders of the 3 kinds of seaweed 'cos we love seaweed!  i love the crunchy pink seaweed, the light green is the common one and the black seaweed was a little coarser.  all were good!  the <mark>Salt and Pepper Squid</mark> arrived - succulent and tender.   next came the <mark>Huancaina Fries</mark> - peru potatoes with queso fresco - delicious!  oh yes!  our favorites were up next:  <mark>Hamachi Kama</mark> - yellowtail fish collar - 2 beautiful pieces charred with a squeeze of key lime and a side of su shohyu sauce - fresh and so tasty!  each one got one <mark>Hamachi Kama</mark> - and that's a lot of fish!  \n\nsuddenly there was break and no food arrived.  we were wondering what happened... then appeared the manager with 2 plates - one dish of <mark>Broiled Peruvian Bay Scallop</mark> (there were 4 in total)  with on one dish and the other a taco with waygu beef for my mum 'cos she's lactose-intolerant.  i was wondering why the waiter had asked us if we had any seashell allergies or any allergies at about 1/3 of the way into our lunch.  now, i know why!!  :o).  the manager explained that he wanted to give us these free appetizers 'cos we were repeat customers!  how generous!  \n\nwe also ordered 2 more rolls - <mark>Samba Strip</mark> - <mark>Half Maine Lobster</mark> - need i say more!  and the lima roll - shrimp and crab.  yummy rolls and the best i've ever had!! \n\nservice was fantastic and we will come back again!",

            "i came back to sushi samba over memorial day weekend and loved it so much that i actually ate there twice. the service and staff are incredible. everyone is really nice, especially the ladies at the bar. the happy hour menu is such a great deal too, $6 for everything (i think there's at least 8 different items to choose from, including 2 different drinks. i recommend the mojito). i loved the <mark>Salt and Pepper Squid</mark> (a better version of fried calamari), <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> roll, and the yellowtail seviche (it had a really nice ginger flavor to it). the kobe beef tacos were also amazing. as i mentioned in my previous review, the portions are not the biggest, but when you factor in that this is vegas, you are actually getting pretty good bang for your buck. \n\nthey should use maybe brighter lights inside though, it's kind of tucked away and easy to miss, in my opinion. people need to see this place!! :) \n\ngreat prices, great service. i will definitely be back! thanks sushi samba!",

            "my mother and i are came here last sunday for happy hour.  the sushi was absolutely delicious- fresh with decent portion sizes.  we particularly liked that they don't use a lot of rice  in lieu of other ingredients like many sushi restaurants. we tried several dishes from the happy hour menu at $6 each:\n\n<mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> roll - good not not too different from other <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> rolls we tried\n<mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark> roll - good portions of <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark> and not too greasy\nsalmon sushi - great flavor with asparagus.  this was my mother's favorite.\njapanese style <mark>Salt and Pepper Squid</mark> - a bit salty but quite tasty.  small portion.\nyellowtail seviche- two thinly sliced yellowtail with a tasty spicy sauce.  this was my favorite.\n\nin addition, we ordered the california roll which was $14.  however,  they used real crab instead of imitation crab.  it was quite tasty with generous amounts of crab used.  \n\nthe service was good.  the restaurant itself is dark with several televisions positioned around- they don't show sports just a program about sushi.  it would be even better if they had a television at the bar for sports.", 
            "food: food here is pretty solid for the most part. tempura fried green beans with truffled aioli and crispy yellow tail taquitos were bright memorable flavors. the pacific roll was decent but not worth the price you pay for. the <mark>Salt and Pepper Squid</mark> was a let down since they use squid strips, which were thick and chewy. \n\nservice: friendly and down to earth. however our server failed to mention a tasting menu to us when other servers had mentioned it to nearby customers. perhaps a bit of stereotyping?\n\nambience: sushisamba kills it on ambience. japanese street art and whimsy decor fill the dining area. its hip and urban and i love it. their seating arrangements left something to be desired though. i sat centimeters away from guests on opposite sides of me. a bit claustrophobic. \n\nverdict: with some standout as well as some strikeout dishes, sushisamba is that kind of place that's great to share a few japanese inspired tapas before a drunken night out on the strip.",

            "since this was downstairs in our hotel, the palazzo, and it was happy hour, we decided to stop by. it's only in the bar area though so we had to wait a little bit for a seat or open area at the bar. special fancy drinks for $6 and then also an assortment of appetizers for also $6 each. each portion is tiny so  getting food for multiple people so it can add up. we tried the yellowtail (2 pieces in an order), <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> roll, <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark> roll, <mark>Salt and Pepper Squid</mark>, and the enzo roll (i think that's what it called). the yellowtail was fresh and had a <mark>Uni</mark> sauce (lemongrass) that it came with. the first two rolls and the squid were ok. and the enzo roll was my favorite. it had salmon and these crispy bits in it and was rolled in like a white rice paper instead of seaweed. for drinks we all tried the fresca, which had muddled strawberries and a bunch of alcohols. i found it light, sweet and refreshing. all and all, a good place for a little something something before dinner. hh is definitely not enough for a full on meal and it's a little pricey but i guess better than a regular meal here.",

            "this is a review of their happy hour (4-7pm and 11pm until close).\n\nthe skinny: spent $50+ on sub par peruvian influenced japanese food (2.5), service: was slow when we wanted to leave (3) value: seeing as there was only 1 dish out of 8 that we would get again, we won't likely be back (3).\n\nwe were excited to see that they had a happy hour menu while meandering through the venetian properties. we thought great! if the food is good during happy hour, we'll come back another time and try their other regularly priced dishes. \n\nso we ordered 8 out of 10 ($6)items on their happy hour menu. of the 8, we'd probably get only 1 item again. the rest was pretty mediocre considering how much they charge for each dish and the level of cuisine.\n\nwe should have known. i mean when the first dish - yellowtail tiradito - came out, i knew it wasn't going to be good. the thinly sliced 2 pieces of yellowtail were drowning in a pepper sauce. i really couldn't taste the flavor of the fish at all. definitely not well balanced. \n\n<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> (3 pieces) with kabocha puree was okay. although the beef had a wonderful smokiness to it, the gyoza were disappointingly undersalted even after dunking in a good amount of soy sauce. the kabocha squash was relatively flavorless which surprised me after reading reviews about this dish.\n\nchicken anticuchos (2 skewers)were not bad although they weren't particularly memorable either. the meat, slightly grilled/charred, was not crispy enough texturally although it was adequately seasoned.\n\neggplant anticuchos with a side of <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark> was okay. i dug the slightly herbaceous kick of the chiffonated mint or basil, cutting the sweetness of the soy based sauce. however the eggplant was a tinge on the tougher side and needed to be roasted with more oil to give it a better texture.  the <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark> is definitely not one of my favorite foods. potato-like in taste and texture, the chef was able to infuse some acidity to make it more flavorful. it was more palatable with the hit of citrus but still, nothing i needed to try again.\n\nthe sushi (veggie kun - kind of like futomaki, ezo roll - meager amounts of salmon/asparagus with a ton of panko breadcrumbs mixed in = bad mouth feel, and <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> - acceptable but nothing exciting) was the most lackluster portion of our meal. considering rice composes about 50% of sushi, it was highly disappointing to find it overly mushy and over seasoned. it kind of ruined it for me. factor in the high rice to filling ratio, i cannot recommend any sushi dish made here. this is rather unfor<mark>Tuna</mark> because sushi comprises at least a significant portion of the menu.\n\nthe only highlight of the meal was the <mark>Salt and Pepper Squid</mark>. melt-in-your-mouth tender pieces of squid with a delicate batter, this was the one dish that the hubs and i truly enjoyed.\n\nfood service was surprisingly and perhaps questionably prompt. there was a small gap in service with our last dish but it wasn't too bad. it was unfor<mark>Tuna</mark> that the bar service was slower than expected and easily overwhelmed. after our meal, we just wanted to get the check processed and go. however, a loud obnoxious group of women (aka the skanky looking anti-milfs who obviously collected club wristbands) completely commandeered her attention with to go orders. the two other bartenders were milling around but did not help her. so the hubs had to endure some random, potentially contagious woman's behind rubbing against his left leg while she took orders from other groups of people. he was highly grumpy after being mauled and ignored.\n\nin reality, this joint rates about a 2.5 however i rounded up to a three based on the fact that there was 1 dish which was truly outstanding. however, given our experience, we are not likely to return. 3 starred review.",

            "the perfect date night spot!\n\nhad a really cool modern ambiance. they had these videos from asia playing on their tvs and we thought that was pretty interesting. the bathrooms were clean and very modern.\n5/5\n\nthe hosts that greeted us at the door were all really clean, pretty and professional.\nparticularly the short asian girl with the long red hair.\n5/5\n\nour waitress was nice, but she didn't explain the menu to us very well. she could have been a little more helpful because it was our first time there and the menu was a little complicated at first glance.\n3/5\n\nthe food was seriously incredible!!\n\nstarted off with a mushroom appetizer, <mark>Mushroom Tobanyaki</mark> w/ kobe, which ended up being a lot larger than i had expected, but i wasn't complaining at all. i had an egg added to it, which was recommended by the host with the red hair.\nwe also got an order of a5 <mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> and kobe beef taquitos with sea foam sauce. the sauce was a really nice twist to a classic. all really amazing. \n5/5\n\nthe drink menu was really great. for date nights i like to try specialty cocktails instead of my usual whiskey. i ordered a mango mojito and my boyfriend had an old fashioned. the mojito was a little bit too sweet for my liking but wasn't bad.\n4/5\n\nthe sushi was well made but i wasn't exactly blown out of the water and neither was my boyfriend. he and i are avid sushi eaters and we love complex rolls with a lot of flavors and textures to them. so the lima roll and san paulo roll were both just decent. we could have gone without them.\n3/5\n\nour entrees were really what impressed us. my boyfriend had a charrasco: <mark>Rio Grande</mark>  and he absolutely loved it. it was excellently paired with a variety of sauces. i'm not much of a red meat kind of eater but i had a small slice and was fairly impressed.\n5/5\n\ni had the large plate of chicken teriyaki. wasn't crazy about it but i definitely finished the whole dish. it was a little small compared to my boyfriends main dish but it was okay with me since we ordered so many dishes.\n4/5\n\noverall we had a really great date night here and would definitely come back for another one. loved it", 
            "amazing! great food, great atmosphere, great service & staff, great selection! \n\nwe made a reservation on tuesday night, got there 15 min early and was seated right away with no issues. my biggest compliment is to our server vanessa...she was extremely knowledgeable about the menu! i couldn't decide between a few things on the menu as separate dishes and she suggested to put two of them together into one dish and promised it would be incredible. and it was! i ordered the <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> and she paired that into the <mark>Mushroom Tobanyaki</mark> and the poached egg was over the filet, it was a dynamite dish!", 
            "i came for a bachelorette party last week on friday night around 11pm. my review is probably (ok definitely) biased because i was in such a bad mood at having to wait until 11pm to eat dinner. however, as you might imagine, 5 girls using one bathroom getting ready to go out in vegas is a production equal to cirque de solei that takes upward of 3 hours. but whatever we finally made it after a 15 minute, mile long cab ride down the strip from the cosmo to the palazzo hotel.  the restaurant was super dark (why don't they turn some lights on?) with huge tvs which were super loud. per the usual at many \"sceney\" type restaurants you could barely here the people across the table from you. \n\nwe got seated no problem as the restaurant was dead except for two or three big groups getting wasted in booths and a few lonely looking stragglers at the bar. our server was friendly but seemed to constantly be in a rush, although to go where i do not know. there seemed to be a ton of bus boys but very few wait staff. he could probably sense our frustration so he promptly brought out a wrought iron tree full of pink drinks. whether or not they had liquor was the only question (answer: not enough.) so we got a range of drinks, the best of which was a cucumber lime martini with vodka. after the night's beginning, i opted with straight vodka and diet coke.\n\nfor food we got a lot. some  memorable dishes were the <mark>Neo Tokyo</mark> roll with tuna which was solid, <mark>Heirloom Tomato Salad</mark> with sweet cilantro dressing, <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark>, <mark>Mushroom Tobanyaki</mark>, and sweet <mark>Coconut Rice</mark> side. my fave dish of all was the <mark>Heirloom Tomato Salad</mark> which was pricey but enough to share between 3 people. the rock shrimp was good but cliched, same as you would get anywhere else. the <mark>Mushroom Tobanyaki</mark> was interesting but not to my taste.  sadly we did not get dessert. \nin conclusion, i can definitely say i hope i will never be back with another bachelorette party, although i would not mind returning otherwise.", 
            "i love sushisamba! i was very familiar with the london location and this was actually my 2nd visit to the vegas location. the food never disappoints at either venue and if you are new to the brand i would recommend having the server either order for you or working closely with them to craft your own \"tasting menu\".  the concept of japanese, peruvian and brazilian can be intimidating and unfamiliar to most but you have to just go with it! \n\nwe let the manager, jason p, order for us and we couldn't have been happier! he was super friendly and asked about any allergies and dietary restrictions and got everything on point. we had an assortment of small plates: <mark>Green Bean Tempura</mark>, edamame, pardon peppers, a <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> roll, some <mark>Crispy Hokkaido Scallop</mark> lettuce wrap, assorted taquitos of yellow tail / lobster / crab and <mark>Mushroom Tobanyaki</mark> with <mark>Duck Breast</mark>. everything was cooked and seasoned perfectly and the staff even made a point to let us know which items to eat first to enjoy at the best possible temperature. everyone we encountered was friendly, engaging, knowledgeable on the menus and so hospitable! \n\nto sum it up, jason p and the whole ss team know what they're freaking doing and i can't wait to go back!", 
            "my family recently had lunch here and enjoyed it.  i tried the amazonia roll, which is a veggie roll wrapped in chard in lieu of seaweed.  that was not indicated in the description, so it was a surprise to me when it arrived at the table.  it was tasty though, as was the <mark>Miso Soup</mark>.  my children shared the quinoa waffles.  what i did not enjoy was the <mark>Mushroom Tobanyaki</mark>.  the flavor was just not good to me and i felt like the dish was missing something.  perhaps serving it over rice to absorb some of the liquid would have been helpful.  service was good and we had several people check on us, not just our waiter.  the reason i docked a star was the price.  i felt like everything was so overpriced.  i don't mind paying more for good quality, and our food was of good quality, but even with that in mind i still left feeling like it was just too overpriced... and i left still a bit hungry.  lunch for 2 adults and 2 kids (no dessert, no drinks) was $130.", 
            "like many things on the strip, sushisamba is an overpriced over the top version of something you could find off the strip. it's tough to rate restaurants on the strip merely because of the price tag but ignoring the inflation, i thought samba had a good vibe, fairly good/quick service, and a decent amount of tasty tapas/appetizers. ironically, i hated all their sushi (mushy, bland sushi rice is no bueno).\n\ni love the concept of samba, and stick with the appetizers and small plates. \n\nthings i liked\n- <mark>Mushroom Tobanyaki</mark>: half mushrooms, half butter. delicious.\n- <mark>Seared W<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> Beef</mark>: small but good.\n\npretty good:\n- <mark>Crispy Jidori Egg</mark>: mostly crispy stuff, not enough eggy goodness\n- <mark>Broiled Peruvian Bay Scallop</mark>: \n\ndo not get:\n- any of the sushi"

            "this was definitely one of the best dining experiences i've had in lv. we called a few hours ahead to make reservations at 8:45pm on a friday night. the restaurant was packed and the decor is absolutely gorgeous. \n\nfor 2 we had:\n\n- edamame organic soybeans, sea salt, lime\n- <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark> golden pea shoot, snap pea jullienne, spicy mayo, black truffle vinaigrette\n- beef tenderloin and aji panca anticuchos\n- miso-marinated chilean <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> roasted organic vegetables and oshinko\n- bobo brazil roll* <mark>Seared W<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> Beef</mark>, avocado, kaiware, shiso, red onion, chimichurri\n- green envy* tuna, salmon, asparagus, wasabi pea crust, aji amarillo-key lime mayo\n\neverything was delicious! the <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark> and <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> were amazing. i wasn't a huge fan of the beef anticuchos, they were seasoned almost too much. the rolls were pretty small and didn't stand out as much as the other food. service was on point, and i would definitely come back!", 
            "peruvian, brazilian, japanese fusion eats....\n\nlocated in the palazzo, i enjoyed everything here except the ramen.  \n\nvibe is nice, <mark>Uni</mark> artwork displayed, staff was attentive.  prices are a bit high and the portions are small (unless you get an entree, which looked like a decent size from what we saw at our neighbor's table) but it's vegas and the food is at least delicious!  i liked how clean the food tasted (except the ramen) and i didn't feel heavy or greasy after.  just content and happy! \n\nnay\n* <mark>Berkshire Pork Belly</mark> ramen- flavor was kinda blah, noodles under al dente, yah this was just not working and it was 18 bucks.  fail.  don't order ramen here, i\"m thinking it's just not the place for it?\n\nyay\n*raspberry mojito....loved it!\n*yellowtail jalape\\u00f1o and lemongrass 14.00---delicious with a nice kick to the sauce...4 pieces of yellowtail that melt in your mouth.  \n*kanpachi yuzu, sea salt, black truffle oil 17.00--this fish is a yellowtail that melts in your mouth, great sauce.  4 pieces.\n*<mark>Whole Squid</mark> lemon aioli 9.00--this was good but nothing wow\n*<mark>Hamachi Kama</mark> key lime and su-shoyu 12.00- loved.  4 pieces.\n*<mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> and miso-16.00----this was my fave.  flavor was great and the <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> just melts in your mouth.  two skewers plus some <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark> that looks like the hominy from pozole.\n*bobo brazil* <mark>Seared W<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> Beef</mark>, avocado, kaiware, shiso, red onion, chimichurri- 17.00---first time having beef in my sushi and it was good. regular size role,  great combo in my mouth.",

            "sushi samba is such a young and hip restaurant with urban japanese art all over the restaurant which is accompanied by loud upbeat music. the crowd here is pretty young and pretty drunk. haha. the table sitting next to me was cackling the entire time, but i didn't mind. anyways, enough about the ambiance and decor, let's talk about the food and mannnnn did me and my sister order kind of a lot. the plates are kind of tapas style so you kinda have to order a lot.\n\nmy sister and i were overly excited about sushi samba being a japanese, peruvian, and brazilian restaurant. we ordered a little bit of everything. so here it is:\n\n- chicken skewers with <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark> and <mark>Scallop</mark>: very very tasty. chicken was tender and grilled to perfection! <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark>, who knew such a thing existed, but nonetheless like ordinary corn. i especially liked the <mark>Scallop</mark> because they were lemony and the presentation was so pretty!\n- <mark><mark>Jumbo Shrimp</mark></mark> ceviche: way too sweet\n- tuna ceviche: tuna was fresh and soft, not too sweet, but not too bland. \n2 sushi rolls, but i forgot the name, but one of them included kobe beef, i think the bobo brazil... and that one was amazing!\n- <mark>Tuna Tataki</mark>: must order. good presentation, perfect balance of crisp and soft. tuna was tasty\n- <mark>Seared W<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> Beef</mark>: the sauce accompanying this dish is so perfect. the beef and mushroom was so good. \n \nalso try the dessert!\n\nwe ordered more stuff, but don't wanna drag this review on. just know that you should come here before a night of dancing and drinking because sushi samba is the perfect place to fill your belly and pre-game!", 
            "we came here on our second night in vegas. it came highly recommended from several friends, and i was excited to try it! it's japanese and brazilian fusion, which sounded exotic and awesome.\n\nwe had a reservation, and i am quite thankful for that. it was packed by the time we got there. the hostess seated us immediately. the tables were all a little close to each other, and you did sort of feel like you were sitting with a bunch of strangers!\n\nour waitress was awesome and knew the menu inside and out. she had some great suggestions (which we ordered).\n\nwe had the <mark>Seared W<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> Beef</mark> sashimi (which they had to make twice because they messed up the first time). it was delicious. next, we had the <mark>Berkshire Pork Belly</mark>, which was just ok. i don't think i'd get it again. then we had the yellowtail ceviche tacos, which were amazing. finally, we ordered two rolls, the bobobrazil and the <mark>Neo Tokyo</mark>. i loved both of them.\n\nfor dessert, we ordered the mochi. it was out of control. by far the best mochi i have ever tasted. \n\ni had prosecco and my boyfriend ordered a beer. it went well with our food.\n\ni'm excited to try the location in chicago!!!!", 
            "my friend wanted to celebrate her tax return and take me to lunch (hooray for me!!) she wanted to have sushi on the strip, well mostly all the sushi restaurants on the strip don't open until dinner, except sushisamba, so that's where we landed.  while we waited for them to open, i was scoping yelp reviews to see what we should order. the <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark> seemed to be the #1 suggestion, so that's what we started out with.  neither  one of us were impressed, sorry to say, but i felt like i was eating just a giant piece of corn kernal. but it was all uphill from there. \n\nour server, drago, was very attentive and full of suggestions, he had asked if we dined here before and i told him i had been to the one in miami, then he said he would bring us something on the house for coming back. when i tell you, you must order these, i'm not exaggerating, they were excellent, not on the menu, <mark>Broiled Peruvian Bay Scallop</mark>, prepared differently than the one on the menu. they were so good we had to order another round. i am a huge fan of yellowtail, so we ordered the yellowtail taquitos, so tasty, i loved the crunch that the mini taco shell added to the yellowtail flavor. next up was a table favorite as well, <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> miso, it melted in your mouth.  i was skeptical at first, they are served on a skewer, so i wasn't expecting the amazing flavor i tasted when i took my first bite. drago suggested the <mark>El Topo</mark> roll, both of us like hot,, super spicy food, this roll had a nice kick at the end, i normaily don't like any kind of dairy on my sushi rolls, i.e. cream cheese, etc....but this had melted mozzarella, it was excellent. then came the grand finale, my friend is a huge kobe beef fan so she wanted to try the <mark>Seared W<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> Beef</mark>, excellent <mark>Grade A5</mark>5, ishi yaki hot stone, dipping sauces, vegetables. presentation was so nice, lots of different sauces to try.  dessert, yes we still had room for dessert, we tried the peruvian hot chocolate con cr\\u00e8me served with <mark><mark>Osetra Caviar Imperial 20g</mark> 20g</mark> and the coco duo dark and white chocolate custard with praline. the second one was by far the best. a must. also try the house made iced tea, they mix fresh orange juice, lime juice and lemon with black tea.....think i drank a pitcher of it.  good food, service, ambiance!", 
            "if you're not willing to read the extended version of my review, just know this...\nif you are a true sushi enthusiast, you must go to sushi samba to experience the most phenomenal sushi ever!\n\nmy boyfriend and i got to sushi samba at around 12am on saturday. it was packed with pretty people and the dj was bumpin' the beats! we didn't need a reservation and were seated quickly. if you're like us and willing to splurge on a palate party sensation, then continue on with reading my review.\n\nwe were greeted by our fabulously bubbly (*not in an annoying way*) and knowledgeable server isabella monstrous (she gave me her business card *how cute is that*). she recommended the crispy yellowtail taquitos (they look more like mini tacos really)...man was she spot on! these little tasty tacos were filled with fresh yellowtail pieces that were swimming in spicy aji panca sauce and fresh lime! they were so delish we decided to get a second order. then we continued on our tasting tour with the following dishes that were the highlights of our night (we ordered more than this, but i don't want to write a colossal review):\n\n* <mark><mark>Assortment of Four</mark></mark> - *my favorites!!!\no yellowtail (jalape\\u00f1o and lemon grass)*\no kanpachi (yuzu, sea salt, black truffle oil*)\no tuna (granny smith apple, serrano, lime)*\no salmon (orange and mustard miso)\n\n* <mark>Seared W<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> Beef</mark>* (ponzu gel\\u00e9e, warm japanese mushroom, truffled tofu crema)\no this was my absolute favorite thing of the night!!!! this sauce was amazing over the <mark>Coconut Rice</mark> (flavors were savory, not sweet, coconut flavor was not over powering). the <mark>Seared W<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> Beef</mark> was so buttery and melted in my mouth. \n* rock shrimp (creamy and crispy deliciousness)\n* dessert - samba split\no i cannot even begin to describe how exceptional this dessert was! i was pretty tipsy by the end of our dinner thanks to a 720 bottle of komotsuru sake ($115, but so worth it, fruity, light flavor and gold flakes don't come cheap). all i remember is decadent coconutty and dulce de leche creamy goodness! seriously, when i took my first bite it was like...\"come on, really?\" i wanted to get another. thank goodness for my boyfriend's fatty prevention intervention! good lookin' out my man!\n\noverall we loved this place because the tapas style servings were perfect for a couple who wanted to try a little of everything. their brazilian play on sushi fusion is quite genius and it works! \n\nthe restaurant is bright and beautiful and most importantly the attentive and knowledgeable servers and wait staff make your meal so much more enjoyable! our bill including tip was over $400, but i truly feel like it was worth every penny! my boyfriend and i will definitely be going back to sushi samba the next time we're in vegas!", 
            "i almost want to give this a 5. near oh my god moment, but not quite.\n\nthis is a little misleading. i swear this came up under \"chinese\" on yelp while we were looking for something (in a group <mark><mark>Assortment of Four</mark></mark>) but this is definitely not chinese. it's japanese brazilian fusion, which i had never had, but was awesome. the menu is a bid daunting, but the waitress offered to bring out a tasting menu for us, based on the common questions like, \"are you ok with raw fish,\" \"do you have allergies,\" \"how do you eat red meat,\" etc. this was helpful - usually i'm not fazed by the large menu, but for some reason i was having problems focusing. worth mentioning they say up front that they'll take back anything we don't like, no charge, and they do ask for a budget to keep them in line.\n\nwhat we got was really pretty exceptional. gyoza steamed and pan fried, hamachi taquitos (not what you're thinking - not the deep fried rolls, but little taco shells filled with hamachi sashimi), seared tuna with baby greens and crunchy salt, and portabella fries with kabocha aioli. all sounds fancy, all really good.\n\nthen a warm plate - grilled <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> with a sweet glaze, <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> (not their a5 w<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark>, which we were offered for an upcharge, but declined) and <mark><mark>Alaskan King Crab</mark> Leg</mark>, all with a side of elote. the bass was good - tender and flaky, and i like the glaze. but it was crazy overpowered by the beef and crab. firstly, the beef was far superior to what we had at n9ne. tender, flavorful, and with a great salt and pepper crust on the outside, served with a little pile of powdered chile for dipping. and the crab was that near oh my god moment. an *enormous* <mark><mark>Alaskan King Crab</mark> Leg</mark>, brushed with a sort of thick butter sauce, served piping hot. wow, this was exceptional. and while i guess i should expect it, points to the restaurant for realizing that serving a filet and a <mark><mark>Alaskan King Crab</mark> Leg</mark> family style to diners that have only chopsticks required that you slice things up in to nice little bite sized pieces.\n\nfinally, sushi. their <mark>Neo Tokyo</mark> roll, which is their version of the <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark>, a hamachi roll with spicy crab and avocado on top, a tuna roll with asparagus, dusted with wasabi, and an assortment of sashimi and nigiri. as well as a hot roll - something covered in melted mozzarella, crispy onions and a sweet sauce. all of the cold rolls were good - i especially liked their <mark>Neo Tokyo</mark> roll. the sashimi was also very good, but the hot roll...i could do without. it was in interesting twist - not just the cheese was hot, but the entire roll, rice and all. however, the cheese and a heaping helping of onion and sauce overpowered whatever might have been inside. this was about the only misstep i could find.\n\nthe atmosphere is odd - lots of pounding techno music, along with an odd video collage (on many many video screens) of brazilian beach babes, bullet trains, brazilian slums, and japanese salarymen trudging to their soul-murdering jobs. not sure what they were going for. but whatever.\n\ngreat spot - chinese though it wasn't, we all were appropriately full when it was over (not hungry, no stuffed) and we all agreed we'd be back. the total bill, excluding drinks, was probably about $65 per person. i loved the mix of appetizers, hot beef and seafood, and sushi. if you're going with a group, this is a fun way to try stuff without having to worry about reading a menu.", 
            "i like sushisamba a lot.  it was a fun restaurant with a cool, modern vibe to it.  it is definitely one of the more trendy sushi restaurants that i have been to.  in no way am i putting sushisamba up there with my favorite japanese restaurant, sushi ran in san francisco.  but it was definitely worth trying out.\n\ni didn't try the omakase, but i wanted to.  i was with my wife, who doesn't like anything but meat and vegetable tempura, so i didn't want to be limited.  so we just ordered off the menu, which was fine.  the rolls here are definitely different then i'm used to.  what with all of the <mark>Foie Gras</mark> and <mark>Seared W<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> Beef</mark>.  the <mark>Neo Tokyo</mark> roll was tasty.  i liked the tuna and tempura flakes together.  i also had the hamachi nigiri and the uni nigiri, both of which were very good.  i love uni, and this was good.\n\nwe had the seasonal vegetable tempura, which was good.  to be honest, i've had better tempura but by no means am i saying that this wasn't a good dish.  i like vegetable tempura, so i would order this again.  we also had the the three meat <mark>Rio Grande</mark> churrasco.  we chose the pork tenderloin, the hanger steak and the ribeye.  the hanger steak was by far the best of the three, with the ribeye coming in second.  it was so tasty.  the pork tenderloin was a bit disappointing.  it was dry and uneventful.  next time, i'm getting three orders of the hanger steak.  and the sauces were a nice complement to the dish.\n\nsushisamba is fun.  the food is good.  and the staff is very helpful and knowledgeable.  i had fun here, and i think that adds a lot to your experience at any restaurant.  i can say that i am a fan.", 
            "i ate here recently with a group of 5. we let the waiter select our menu for the night which i think is a great way to dine here. my only complaint is that we had too much food and i ate too much before the sushi came. next time i will decrease the amount we spend per person and ask for the sushi to come sooner in the meal. we really enjoyed the yellowtail taquitos, <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> and the <mark>Seared W<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> Beef</mark> that we cooked on hot rocks!!! this was awesome!! service was excellent!! i will go back!!", 
            "one of my favorite restaurants. i was here with several people, and we opted for the 7 course chef's choice meal. it was worth every penny. the highlight for me was the <mark>Seared W<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> Beef</mark>. they bring it raw and let you sear it on a hot stone.", 
            "whenever we are in vegas and stay at the palazzo, the better half insists on stopping by this joint so she can get her sushi on.  on this particular visit, i joined her for lunch and we grubbed.\n\nshe ordered 4 orders of unagi (eel), $4 ea. i ordered some edamame, $6 and the <mark>Seared W<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> Beef</mark>, $18.\n\nthe beef was awesome and while it's a small plate, it's very rich and fulfilling.  tbh enjoyed her unagi....it's her fav.\n\nwe ate lunch at around 3 pm, which is a great time to do that because it's between the busy lunch and dinner hours, so there's not too many people around.  when it gets busy, it can get crowded.\n\nwe'll definitely be back.\n\nreturn factor - 90%", 
            "intrigued by the japanese/south american fusion going on here and the rather good yelp reviews, i ended up here with a group for a late dinner one sunday night during a recent trip to vegas. we were seated promptly at our reserved time.\n\nthe service was immediately kind of odd. our waiter did not give us menus (other than for drinks), but instead started talking about how if we had a particular budget in mind, they could send us enough food to fill that budget. butbutbut...i saw the menu online! i knew there was a menu. i wanted to be in control! would the waiter let us be in control?\n\nafter awhile yes, yes he did. we were able to secure some menus, and he then proceeded to go through the different sections of the menu with us as if we were eight years old and/or eating dinner by ourselves at a restaurant for the first time. is fusion really that scary for people?\n\nso we ordered a couple of rounds, tapas style, like we do. there were hits and misses along the way. the best stuff was in the robata area of the menu. the <mark>Berkshire Pork Belly</mark> with the butterscotch miso about slayed me with its awesomeness. the <mark>Duck Breast</mark> dish we got was also killer, with a fantastic sauce and lots of meaty, meaty mushrooms. the shishito peppers were solid, as was the sea eel we got nigiri style. it's hard to mess those two up. the yamato rolls, in all their decadence, were worth every penny.\n\nthe <mark>Seared W<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> Beef</mark> was probably the biggest miss of the evening. the menu does not list truffle oil in the dish's ingredients, but that's about all i could taste. and for me, truffle oil makes everything taste and smell rancid. not appealing. the <mark>El Topo</mark>, while quite good, was also a bit of a disappointment. i love fried onions, but they seemed to overpower here. the yellowtail sashimi also seemed a bit off, as the lemongrass sauce wasn't particularly complimentary. \n\nthe service was alright but stayed a little odd during our visit. sometimes our waiter would be absent for long periods of time, and then suddenly would be around almost too often. the place was loud, almost too loud. prices are about what you'd expect for a sushi spot on the strip. overall, i enjoyed this place, but it is easily overshadowed by the plethora of better options nearby.", 
            "this was my second time here and after going to the chicago location, chicago rules all the way. the worst roll ever was the <mark>Samba Strip</mark> w/lobster, it looked like an amateur put it together. there was no flavor and for the price of $19, umm not! the only roll that was good was the yamato (<mark>Foie Gras</mark>) and bobo brazil (<mark>Seared W<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> Beef</mark>). \n\nhowever, you must order the coco duo, it was the bomb!!!", 
            "the food was amazing.  this is saying a lot for someone who spends $200 for dinner with a date pretty frequently.\n\nthe rare <mark>Seared W<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> Beef</mark> sushi was amazing as was the yellow tail sashimi taquitos.  everything was fresh as well, which left us commenting on how they get such fresh sushi in the desert (i suppose anything can be frozen and transported across half the world these days).  \n\nmy dates cocktail was pretty impressive as well, the cocktail glass lined in sugar.\n\ni'm pretty partial to asian fusion, in general, and with the addition of the brazilian flair, this place is one of the rare few that get my five stars.\n\nin vegas style, a pretty swank interior with hanging sculptures, a viewing window of one table, into the mens bathroom, and open and expansive seating area in the back, all come together nicely for a great meal out.\n\nthey're open late night (2am on weekends) - so a bonus if you're strolling out of tao a bit early.", 
            "i enjoy sushi samba a ton and it is one of my favorite restaurants in vegas. i have been there three and had the tasting menu each time. this place is essentially japanese, peruvian, and brazilian fusion. \n\nif you're willing to spend some money ($50-$100 a head), i recommend doing the tasting menu. it's a 5-7 food course and displays some of the full offering of the restaurant. some of the highlights of my meal were the ceviche tacos, the <mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> (sp?), the meat courses, and finally the sushi. the sides are also excellent, with the <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark> and more.\n\nall in all, it's <mark>Uni</mark> food and definitely worth checking out. this place is very pricey though, so be prepared to spend money.", 
            "i wasn't feeling sushi, but i went with it. \nmy expectations were low, just another sushi bar in vegas...\nwe gave our server, veronica, a per-person budget and let her pick.\n\n i was blown away!\n\nwe were served mini tacos, <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> skewers, sashimi ceviche, <mark>Seared W<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> Beef</mark>, salt & <mark>Salt and Pepper Squid</mark> and more. the plates just kept coming. how did they get such incredible flavors into the food? i would put sushisamba up against the best. sure, nobu (malibu) may have great atmosphere, but the flavors, quality, variety, and probably 100 different <mark>Sake</mark> here, make them a strong competitor. \n\n\nservice was impeccable (ask for veronica).", 
            "located in the shoppes at palazzo casino. my original plan was to get some comps redeemed for grand lux cafe (which is a great place as well). to my surprise, i had over 100 bucks available...i don't remember playing in the venetian poker room that much, but oh well. a bigger surprise, they had a long list of places i could use comps at, including steakhouses, and here. this is not the norm for vegas poker rooms. i guess this could be a venetian poker room review as well; they treat their customers very well! so i decided to try this place. \n\ni'm very glad that i did! my waitress isabella was very attentive, thorough, and answered any questions i had. top notch service! the rest of the waitstaff was even friendlier. my table was periodically kept clean, and lots of refills kept coming. \n\ni was expecting to eat regular sushi, maybe a tasting menu. and i never really thought of what the samba part meant. but i looked at the menu and there were lots of options available, fusion-style: from brazilian steaks to <mark><mark>Osetra Caviar Imperial 20g</mark> 20g</mark> rolls. i was in for an unexpected and different, yet very satisfying meal. \n\n-samba tea: this is a must try! i forgot what they were, but they included many different types of ingredients; the result being one of my favorite teas, if not my favorite. \n-bobo brazil samba roll: <mark>Seared W<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> Beef</mark>, brazilian-japanese style...something new and amazing!\n-miso-marinated chilean <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>...so good! one of the best fish i've ever had.\n-20oz <mark>Bone in Ribeye</mark> steak: juicy and delicious. loved the flavor! goes very well with the sushisamba dipping sauces. \n-warm chocolate banana cake (maple butter, banana chip, vanilla rum ice cream)...awesome!\n\nservice: 5/5; food: 5/5!\n\nthis was a <mark>Uni</mark> and awesome dining experience for me. and it looks like there's plenty more to try! thanks sushisamba. i would definitely come back!", 
            "seriously one of the best meals i think i have ever had. they have brazilian, peruvian, and japanese dishes on the menu and the d\\u00e9cor reflects an interesting combination of these cultures. on this visit we stuck with japanese especially since they have so many dishes with <mark>Seared W<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> Beef</mark>. ordered several sushi rolls, all of which were fantastic! we also tried some of the <mark>Berkshire Pork Belly</mark> that was cooked with a miso glaze. delish! by far the highlight of the meal was the <mark>Seared W<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> Beef</mark> gyoza. order this and i promise you won't be disappointed. the staff was all very friendly and gave us some very good recommendations!", 
            "on the saturday of my bachelorette party, my girlfriends treated me to dinner at sushi samba.  it was a fabulous, memorable meal, where we ate well and celebrated in style.\n\nwe were staying at the palazzo, and sushi samba was the perfect venue for the occasion.  it was convenient to get to in heels, and the atmosphere was festive, edging on clubby without being obnoxious.  we had a big comfortable table, and service was excellent.  i wish we'd gotten the name of our waiter - he did a great job attending to our every need, and he guided us through the whole dining experience with expertise.  (for management - he was a tall guy who served a party of nine on 6/29.  you know, your only bachelorette party of the month?)\n\nwe ordered cocktails, which were pretty good.  i had a blame it on rio, a caipirinha variation with cacha\\u00e7a, agave syrup, fresh lime juice, cucumber, and jalape\\u00f1o.  it was both cool and spicy, and it went down really easy.  the classic caipirinha was also great, with just the cacha\\u00e7a, lime, and sugar.  i also tried some of the chu-cumber, a shochu drink with hendricks gin, elderflower liqueur, and muddled cucumber - very refreshing.  at some point, we got a complimentary cocktail tree, a beautiful iron tree bearing shot-sized wine glasses on every branch.  they held some frothy, sweet version of a screwdriver that was great for the occasion.\n\ndinner was delicious.  we had the option of ordering a la carte or omakase, and we decided to keep things simple.  we specified a price point and listed dietary restrictions, and the food just started coming.  it was all served family style, and everything was well portioned for our big group.  we left full but not overstuffed - a plus, since it had taken a team to stuff me into my white dress for the night.  the cuisine was fun, a creative, unforced fusion of japanese and peruvian styles.\n\nfirst, we had a trio of vegetable otsumami, all served together in a lovely green array.  there was the staple edamame with sea salt and lime, and <mark>Green Bean Tempura</mark> served with a rich black truffle aioli.  my favorite of the three, though, was the handful of shishito peppers.  these were grilled blistering black, polished with sea salt and lemon.  they were pretty irresistible.  next we got a tray of japanese a5 <mark>Seared W<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> Beef</mark> gyoza.  these were great, thin-skinned and stuffed with luscious hunks of beef rather than the usual mince.  they came with kabocha pumpkin pur\\u00e9e, a sweet soy drizzle, and a su-shoyu dipping sauce.  the best thing i ate all night, though, was a crispy taquito overflowing with yelllowtail, avocado, and roasted corn miso.  the shell was thin and crunchy, and the fresh, tender fish was just right with that avocado, miso, and some thinly sliced vegetables.  the taquitos were served with spicy aji panca sauce and fresh lime - that piquant, frothy sauce was just the icing on a beautiful fusion taco cake.\n\nafter the smaller plates were done, we moved on to big platters of sushi and sashimi.  i do not remember everything we got, as there were at least six or seven rolls and even more kinds of sashimi.  the rolls were great, a nice mix of california standards - you know, the mix and match of eel, yellowtail, tuna, etc. with avocado, cucumber, and dots of mayo - and more samba-specific stuff, with the stray <mark><mark>Alaskan King Crab</mark> Leg</mark> and lobster claw.  i particularly liked the <mark>Samba Strip</mark>, with <mark>Half Maine Lobster</mark> tempura, mango, tomato, chive, soy paper, and a coating of crispy rice.  it was unusual and flavorful, served with a peanut curry.  the rest of the platter came with a sweet thick soy sauce and a bit of mayo.  the sashimi was more traditional, served on a bed of ice.  it was hard to share, as there was only one of each kind, but the slivers i had were great.\n\nthe most filling part of the meal was the churrasco course.  we got two hefty platters of the <mark>Rio Grande</mark> with three meats, grilled hanger steak, ribeye, and chorizo.  these were great, juicy and tender and full of that hearty grilled meat flavor.  they came with a trio of dipping sauces - malagueta pepper oil, chimichurri, and a third that is infuriatingly absent from the menu.  we also had some sides of rice, beans, collard greens, and a medley of <mark>Roasted Seasonal Vegetables</mark> - giant corn kernels, toothsome brussels sprouts, carrots, celery, pearl onions, and more.  we also got miso-marinated chilean <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> a la carte, with roasted organic vegetables and oshinko.  this was a winner - the fish was moist, flakey, and shot through with miso flavor.\n\nwe were full by dessert, but loved the complimentary chocolate mousse, served with a sparkler and a congratulatory message.  the lush mousse came topped with crunchy chocolate pearls, whipped cream, and a little bit of candle-stuck banana.  we each got a sweet bite to end our wonderful dinner.\n\nin conclusion, my friends are the best - thank you girls for this weekend, and for this fun, delicious meal.  sushi samba was an a+ choice, worthy of a night i won't soon forget.", 
            "first of all... amazing!  if you're okay with tapas style, paying a little more for a good meal, and willing to have fusion-y food... this place rocks!  the non-sushi plates are all worth trying... but our favorites were: japanese a5 <mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark>, yellowtail taquitos, the <mark>Broiled Peruvian Bay Scallop</mark> and the melt on you're mouth <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>! \n\nyes... this is a pricey joint, so maybe try the dishes that seem safe to you first, but everything we tried was simply amazing...that said, the sushi itself may not be anything too special, but the fusion items are totally worth every cent! \n\nmy suggestion: check out the menu beforehand so you have an idea of what to start with... as with all fusion foods, the descriptions are essential :)  \n\nof note: all the staff was helpful and friendly and intent on service...if you're lucky enough to get isabella... trust her!  her suggestions were all on point!",

            "i really want to give this place 3.5 stars - i do like it a lot, but the first time i came here, i was absolutely floored. we did the \"tasting\" where the waitress asked what we liked, what we didn't, and just brought tasting portions of dishes for each of us to try based on our answers. it was phenomenal. everything we had...i loved. i dreamed about it! ok...maybe not dreamed about it, but i promised myself that next time i was in vegas, i would be back (especially since first food & bar closed in the palazzo, that was my favorite).\n\nso, a few months later, i made my way back, this time for my sisters birthday. since there weren't as many of us, we decided to go for lunch. i got my 3 favorite things from before - the w<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> potstickers (amazing - the pumpkin puree is fantastic, i want a jar of it. it's creamy and sweet but not out of place), the mushroom \"stew\" like appetizer (sorry can't remember the name!) with the \"kobe\" beef skewers, and the <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> skewers (definitely a highlight). aside from that, we got a couple sushi rolls and edamame. the rolls we got were recommended, and i must say, none of them wowed me. they were all just ok. the fish was fresh, but the flavors just didn't mesh as well as anything else (hence the deduction).\n\nall in all, i do like this place a lot, but i would stick to the robata/brazilian/peruvian side of things, not so much the sushi!", 
            "in las vegas as well as other big restaurant/entertainment towns, good food is expected but in las vegas it sometimes does not fully compare to chicago and ny.\n\nhowever, the one place i finally went to was sushi samba and what a great surprise.  i tend to avoid sushi in several places when traveling unless in hawaii and some parts of ca and japan.  sushi samba had some of the best dishes i have had and the quality was great.  they have a variety of menu items with small plates and full entrees.  they do some <mark><mark>Osetra Caviar Imperial 20g</mark> 20g</mark> but mostly more interesting variations as well as the s american dishes.  some of the items were:\nrock fish\n<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark>\n<mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark>\n<mark>Green Bean Tempura</mark>\n<mark>Berkshire Pork Belly</mark>\n<mark>Moqueca Mista</mark>. seafood coconut milk and rice with green onion\nyamato sushi roll(maguro, fois gras, <mark><mark>Osetra Caviar Imperial 20g</mark> 20g</mark>)\nuni shushi outstanding \ngreat sake list\n\nall the fish and shellfish were fresh and well prepared.\n\nit gets busy so we ate at the bar and the service was excellent there.  luna and maria can help with picking some great dishes at the bar.\n\nit is on the higher price side but worth it compared to a lot of other places where the food doesn't always live up to the expectations in vegas.  looking forward to next trip back there.",

            "sushisamba fuses japanese, peruvian, and brazilian flavors- peculiar, until you realize that brazil is home to the largest japanese population outside of japan itself.\n\nfrom edamame to plantains, wasabi to chiles, sushisamba is a true testament to the <mark>Uni</mark> tastes created by immigration and integration and the balanced evolution of these flavors over the last 100 years. \n\nhaving visited the las vegas location several times as well as the miami one, sushisamba is high on my list of culinary experiences that delights time after time.\n\namong my favorites is yamato roll, comprised of tuna, <mark>Foie Gras</mark>, <mark><mark>Osetra Caviar Imperial 20g</mark> 20g</mark>, topped with gold leaf. at $19 for 3 pieces, you may have to take a sledgehammer to that piggy bank, but you probably won't regret it.  \n\nanother outstanding roll is the bobo brazil, filled with avocado, kaiware, shiso, red onion, and chimichurri inside, layered with tender <mark>Seared W<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> Beef</mark> on the outside. every bite melds into the tongue and disappears in a flurry of flavor.\n\ni tried the kanpanchi tiradito on this last visit and didn't find it worth the $19. drizzled in yuzu, sea salt, black truffle oil, the 4 small slices of amberjack were acceptable but not exceptional.\n\non a final note, our waitress looked like a gorgeous supermodel, which worked out great in curbing my own appetite, thus making the meal more affordable. i already started a new piggy bank for next time.", 
            "sushi samba is the perfect place to grab some dinner and cocktails before heading out to a club, concert or show with your group of friends. it may be too loud for an intimate date unless you're going for lunch.\n\nour server was great but the hostesses were bitches. we arrived a little early to the podium with no greeting. hey, smile and greet. that's pretty much your only job besides answering the phone and seating! we were not able to be seated until the scheduled reservation time so we sat at the bar to start off with some drinks while we waited. the food was good. we ordered the <mark>Seared W<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> Beef</mark> gyoza, assorted sashimi and hamachi tacos. the sashimi is the new age fusion kind with the yuzu sauces and  jalapeno topping so don't expect it to be in its pure naked form like <mark><mark>Osetra Caviar Imperial 20g</mark> 20g</mark> restaurants. maybe they do also offer it in its pure form but we didn't order or expect it that way and the quality of the fish is mediocre so you may not want it that way anyway. \n\ni'll definitely be back!", 
            "i didn't know what to expect with japanese/brazilian fusion, but this place exceeded my expectations. we tried a mixture of classic sushi, <mark>Miso Soup</mark> and some fusion dishes. the sushi was exceptionally fresh with <mark>Uni</mark> presentation. \n\nfusion dishes to try: \n<mark>El Topo</mark> (roll), which had salmon, jalape\\u00f1o, shiso leaf, fresh melted mozzerella, crispy onion. it sounds absurd and it was just that... absurdly delicious. \n\ncarnaval (roll)- shrimp, avocado, yellowtail, soy paper. this one wasn't as good as <mark>El Topo</mark>, but still offered a cool twist on a typical japanese favorite.\n\n<mark>Miso Soup</mark> - it was a great miso but with added cilantro to lend to the brazilian side of the restaurant. amazing twist!\n\n<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> - kabocha pur\\u00e9e and su-shoyu dipping sauce made this sweet, tangy, and a little spicy. we ended up ordered another batch after downing the first order in 30 seconds. so good!\n\nwe also ordered some robata items, which were great, but paled in comparison to the fusion dishes and the sushi items. this place is absolutely worth a stop! also, the price is right. we ordered a ton of food for 5 people and the bill was reasonable!", 
            "i am so glad we had the chance to dine at sushisamba our last night in vegas! our waiter michael was fantastic and made the entire experience that much more memorable. we literally loved everything we ordered. be sure to make a reservation because it gets very busy, and if you're celebrating anything let the hostess know. we were celebrating our wedding anniversary and they gave us a free small dessert.\n\nsmall plates:\n<mark>Seared W<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> Beef</mark> goyza - do not miss this! it was incredible - every table around us had also ordered it and we were in unanimous agreement.\n\nyellowtail crispy taquitos - light & delicious with an asian dressing on the greens.\n\nrobata:\nribeye - it's described as spicy but it's not, just has subtle spic flavoring and was very tender.\n\n<mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> - phenomenal. there's a reason it's the most popular thing on the menu. melts in your mouth with an amazing miso glaze.\n\nsamba rolls:\n<mark>Neo Tokyo</mark>: similar to a <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> roll flavor but with tuna both inside and on top of the roll. fresh and great flavor.\n\ndessert: \nfried doughnuts with cream dipping sauce - oh my goodness, sooo good. not a light dessert (fried dough) but ah-ma-zing.\n\nsince we were celebrating our wedding anniversary, they gave us a free small dessert of green tea ice cream pops dipped in chocolate with pop candy crust, which was cool and refreshing.\n\nwe will definitely be back on our next trip!",

            "i should mention the one star rating is primarily based on two factors:\n\n1- the <mark>Kumamoto Oysters</mark> they served were bad.  like old and spoiled bad.  it took half the remainder of my dinner to get the taste out of my mouth from one of them.\n2 - no brazilian beer.   i ordered a brazilian lager and 10 minutes later was told they were out of it.  i then ordered a south american pilsner and they were out of that.  i then decided not to drink.  after mentioning the oyster quality to our server, the manager asked what they could do.  well, they found that pilsner they were out of.\n\nthe sushi was decent, but not exceptional. the brazilian fish stew was rather boring, the <mark>Coconut Rice</mark>, beans and quinoa about average and the grilled eggplant not so good.  i was hoping for the eggplant that sensei can deliver.\n\ntables are very small for the larger number of dishes and it's extremely loud.\n\ni guess i shouldn't have expected much from a brazilian-peruvian-japanese fusion.  i haven't been to peru, but feel that brazilian cuisine is about as good as  english food.\n\nperhaps i would have liked their <mark>Seared W<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> Beef</mark>, but at $32/oz. and the seeming lack of kitchen talent, i decided not to try it.",

            "we came to sushisamba for my birthday dinner a few days ago and i was blown away by the food! it definitely exceeded expectations.\n\nthe menu was so overwhelming we didn't know where to even begin and while our waiter didn't really help us narrow things down, he did make some good suggestions and helped us pace out the meal so we can order as we go. he came with the manager, who was very nice and gave us birthday shots, and also asked that we let him know if he could do anything. \n\nhere's what we started with: shishito peppers combo (grilled shishito peppers, tempura string beans with a truffle aioli, and edamame), <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark> in a spicy mayo sauce, <mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark>, and <mark>Crispy Hokkaido Scallop</mark> lettuce wraps. the peppers were a good surprise of the night because i didn't expect it to come with the string beans and edamame, but i definitely appreciated the greens in vegas! the <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark> was really tasty, but i wish it was a little crunchier when it came out. they tasted a bit soggy as if they were sitting in sauce for too long, but no complaints because the flavor was still there. the <mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> was good, but nothing really mind-blowing in my opinion. the <mark>Crispy Hokkaido Scallop</mark> lettuce wrap was phenomenal. our waiter said it was a new item on the menu and suggested we try it and it really blew us all out of the water. \n\nwe followed up the first round with the robata - we got the <mark>Berkshire Pork Belly</mark>, rib eye, <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>, and duck. all of them were so good, so make sure you pay a visit to the robata section when you visit! the duck and the rib eye to me stood out more than the others - they were cooked very well and had a good mix of <mark>Uni</mark> flavors.\n\nwe finished off dessert with their 4th of july special (red velvet cheesecake, frozen blueberries, and white chocolate ice cream) and sadly we were underwhelmed with what came out. i think we were so blown away by the entire meal, we felt like dessert was going to continue the streak, but were left wanting a bit more. either way, we were so stuffed it didn't matter and the dessert didn't take away from how much we liked the meal itself.\n\nwhat really set this over the edge is that the chef came out to shake our hands and chat with us really quickly, which i really appreciated! the service was great, the recommendations were on par, and the food was delicious. i would definitely recommend this spot for a special occasion - go ahead and gorge!!", 
            "this is a review of their happy hour (4-7pm and 11pm until close).\n\nthe skinny: spent $50+ on sub par peruvian influenced japanese food (2.5), service: was slow when we wanted to leave (3) value: seeing as there was only 1 dish out of 8 that we would get again, we won't likely be back (3).\n\nwe were excited to see that they had a happy hour menu while meandering through the venetian properties. we thought great! if the food is good during happy hour, we'll come back another time and try their other regularly priced dishes. \n\nso we ordered 8 out of 10 ($6)items on their happy hour menu. of the 8, we'd probably get only 1 item again. the rest was pretty mediocre considering how much they charge for each dish and the level of cuisine.\n\nwe should have known. i mean when the first dish - yellowtail tiradito - came out, i knew it wasn't going to be good. the thinly sliced 2 pieces of yellowtail were drowning in a pepper sauce. i really couldn't taste the flavor of the fish at all. definitely not well balanced. \n\n<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> (3 pieces) with kabocha puree was okay. although the beef had a wonderful smokiness to it, the gyoza were disappointingly undersalted even after dunking in a good amount of soy sauce. the kabocha squash was relatively flavorless which surprised me after reading reviews about this dish.\n\nchicken anticuchos (2 skewers)were not bad although they weren't particularly memorable either. the meat, slightly grilled/charred, was not crispy enough texturally although it was adequately seasoned.\n\neggplant anticuchos with a side of <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark> was okay. i dug the slightly herbaceous kick of the chiffonated mint or basil, cutting the sweetness of the soy based sauce. however the eggplant was a tinge on the tougher side and needed to be roasted with more oil to give it a better texture.  the <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark> is definitely not one of my favorite foods. potato-like in taste and texture, the chef was able to infuse some acidity to make it more flavorful. it was more palatable with the hit of citrus but still, nothing i needed to try again.\n\nthe sushi (veggie kun - kind of like futomaki, ezo roll - meager amounts of salmon/asparagus with a ton of panko breadcrumbs mixed in = bad mouth feel, and <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> - acceptable but nothing exciting) was the most lackluster portion of our meal. considering rice composes about 50% of sushi, it was highly disappointing to find it overly mushy and over seasoned. it kind of ruined it for me. factor in the high rice to filling ratio, i cannot recommend any sushi dish made here. this is rather unfor<mark>Tuna</mark> because sushi comprises at least a significant portion of the menu.\n\nthe only highlight of the meal was the <mark>Salt and Pepper Squid</mark>. melt-in-your-mouth tender pieces of squid with a delicate batter, this was the one dish that the hubs and i truly enjoyed.\n\nfood service was surprisingly and perhaps questionably prompt. there was a small gap in service with our last dish but it wasn't too bad. it was unfor<mark>Tuna</mark> that the bar service was slower than expected and easily overwhelmed. after our meal, we just wanted to get the check processed and go. however, a loud obnoxious group of women (aka the skanky looking anti-milfs who obviously collected club wristbands) completely commandeered her attention with to go orders. the two other bartenders were milling around but did not help her. so the hubs had to endure some random, potentially contagious woman's behind rubbing against his left leg while she took orders from other groups of people. he was highly grumpy after being mauled and ignored.\n\nin reality, this joint rates about a 2.5 however i rounded up to a three based on the fact that there was 1 dish which was truly outstanding. however, given our experience, we are not likely to return. 3 starred review.", 
            "my dining experience fell short of my expectations considering what we ate (or shall i say what we didn't eat) compared to what we paid. there were 21 of us for dinner and we had the chef's selection, also known as omakase. typically, you would get the most innovative dishes ordering this style.  however, we were served typical menu items.  i think it was just a strategic way for them to serve a larger group without having to cater to individual orders. \n\nthe good was that most of the items we tasted were pretty good. the bad was that we weren't given enough food to taste everything, even though we were all charged the same price.  \n\ninstead, we shared each plate of food between 5-7 people, which included the following: \n(1) <mark>Tuna Tataki</mark>: only got to try it because someone didn't eat raw fish. \n(2) <mark>Seared W<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> Beef</mark> dumplings: not enough brought out so i never got to try it. \n(3) mini yellow tail tacos:  i liked the spicy foam which added a nice kick to the citrus-ey flavors of the dish. \n(4) crab tempura: how ridiculous is it that there were only several pieces to each order so the hubs and i had to share one bite of one piece? this wouldn't even qualify as an amuse-bouche. \n(5) <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> and shrimp skewers: again, not enough so most of us shared skewers. \n(6) steak and mushroom stew: everyone got 1-2 thin slices of beef, which was tender and flavorful. \n(7) sushi rolls/sashimi: the sushi rolls were the most generous items served (about 5 cut rolls) but imo were rather underwhelming. the sashimi, on the other hand, was delicious and fresh. we were given about 3 slices each of yellowtail, tuna, and salmon which i easily could have eaten by myself.\n\ni felt bad for the hubs because he was still hungry and asked what was being served next, only to be told that it was just dessert followed by a $2500 bill ($240 per couple). \n\nyes, our server was pleasant and friendly. yes, the food was quite tasty.  and, yes, they need to recalculate the amount of food for groups ordering from the chef's selection. sure, i expected to pay a lot for this kind of meal, but what i didn't expect was to leave unsatisfied and wanting for more.", 
            "absolutely love this place.  the food is just amazing. we had a group of 4.  we asked the server to just bring out plates and set an approximate price limit ($50 ea).  there was an assortment of meat, rice and of course.. sushi.  a couple of my favorite dishes:  japanese a5 <mark>Seared W<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> Beef</mark> gyoza, yellow tail with jalapeno and the plantain.  to make this place seal the deal of a 5.. the cucumber martini was delish!!!  can't wait til the next visit.\n\np.s.  staff is fast, courtesy and overall awesome!",

            "hubby and i decided to take a stroll down the strip.  since we were staying at the encore we had to pass through the palazzo.  we decided to go through the grand canal shoppes to take advantage of the ac since it was 110 outside.  we walked by sushi samba and really liked the ambiance so we decided to have a late lunch there.\n\nwe had the <mark>Rio Grande</mark> ($45) which came with rib eye, w<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> picante, and a chicken sausage.  it also came with a serving of rice, beans, and various sauces to dip the aforementioned proteins.\n\nthe w<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> picante and rib eye were both melt in your mouth delicious :).  i wish we had a little more rice to go with the meats though.\n\nthe highlight of the night is definitely the sushi here.  (hey, maybe that's why they named the restaurant sushisamba.)  we ordered the <mark>Samba Sushi</mark> 7 piece with the green envy roll ($26).  the fish tasted fresh and the green envy roll is delicious!!\n\nthe service here was fantasic and we will definitely be back.", 
            "this place is overrated in my opinion. i've definitely had better sushi, and i was very disappointed. i had heard about sushi samba for many years, so i was very excited to finally try it out. \n\nfor our appetizer, we ordered the kobe beef dumplings which were very flavorful. for our main dish we ordered three different rolls: bobo brazil, <mark>El Topo</mark>, and carnaval. the carnval was my favorite, but still average, compared to other sushi i've had. the bobo brazil is topped with thin slices of <mark>Seared W<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> Beef</mark>, which i thought i would enjoy, but it was just mostly fat that you couldn't chew through. the carnaval comes with melted mozzarella cheese at the bottom, which i didn't find adding of any value to the taste. the only thing i did like at the restaurant was the non-alcoholic watermelon drink. it was sweet, sour, and refreshing which i loved. \n\ni didn't care for the ambiance or customer service either; our waitress barely came to our table and the place was too crowded. i'm glad i tried this place out, but i won't be coming back.", 
            "don't order takeout. \n\ni usually love sushisamba and make a point to eat there every time i go to vegas. this time, i was extremely disappointed.\n\ni ordered 2 <mark>Rio Grande</mark> to go since i had to catch a flight and the folks back home love the <mark>Rio Grande</mark>. unfor<mark>Tuna</mark>, part of my order was missing, even after i questioned it.\n\non the bill, the <mark>Rio Grande</mark> was listed as gaucho, so i asked about this and they assured me that it was the same. since i usually have a great meal and the service is usually good, i didn't question it. the <mark>Rio Grande</mark> is 45 dollars on the menu, so i expected to be charged 90 for both. however, for those two items, it was listed as $114. i also ordered 2 sides. \n\ni didn't bring it up because i usually love sushisamba and wouldn't mind paying more to support the restaurant. i also ordered a cocktail and the w<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> appetizer while waiting, so my bill was a bit hefty. on top of this, i included roughly a 20 percent so my total bill was about 190 - after i was reassured that my order was correct. i didn't have time to look through the bag because i needed to catch a flight, but once i got to the airport, i found out that the chorizo and the ribeye steak was not included (usually the <mark>Rio Grande</mark> comes with those two proteins and the picanha, but my order only had the picanha, the two sides i ordered.\n\nyou can imagine my frustration. when i takeout from a restaurant, especially one that i frequent, i expect my order to be correct. i honestly regret tipping so much and even ordering takeout from there today.\n\ni would give 1 star for this experience. the extra star is because i usually do have a positive experience (with philip, who is the best server in the world and has great service).\n\ni don't think i will come back here ever again. something amazing would have to happen for me to give this place a second chance.",

            "i think our waitress was new because she was really confused and awkward but that wasn't really an issue since the food was amazing!\n\nwe got the tasting menu and you can choose if you want to pay $50-$100 pp, so if you've never been here it's a good way to go. the waitress will ask you if you have any food allergies and what you can/can't eat and then will bring out 5 or so appetizers and 2 types of sushi (if you get the $50-$60 pp) and then will let you know how much money you have left  and you can either use it to get another dish or use it for dessert which is what we did.\n\neverything we got was good but the best one was the <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>...so delicious!  we also got the yellow tail tacos,  <mark>Seared W<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> Beef</mark> goyza, tempura green beans, tuna app, some sushi and the green tea chocolate dessert. looking back at the menu now i don't see all of the items we got so it's a bit confusing like some of the reviews say.", 
            "this is simply on my favorite restaurants in las vegas. because of sushisamba, i fell in love with sushi. i took my husband here to celebrate his 31st birthday, because he absolutely loves sushi. on top of that, he hasn't celebrated a birthday in while since he spent the last 2 of them deployed in afghanistan. i mentioned that on our opentable reservation, and they treated us with extra care. the manager gave my husband a complimentary drink and dessert. my husband and i ordered off menu, and decided to do a tasting for $55 a person. prices can go up depending on how much you want to spend. it was about 5 courses. my favorite was the <mark>Seared W<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> Beef</mark> empanadas, they were so delicious it practically melted in your mouth. the sashimi was delicious and soaked in some sort of yuzu sauce.\n\nthe service is top notch, and if you are looking for a <mark>Uni</mark> sushi experience, you have to try sushisamba. it's an absolute must. trust the chef, and go with a tasting, they know what they are doing there.", 
            "what a way to celebrate my 21st birthday. after this experience i can only hope to have the opport<mark>Uni</mark> to come back year after year to celebrate just as perfectly.\n\nnot only was the food and drink world-class, the service and attention was deserving of 5 stars alone and both the servers and manager truly made this a special and memorable meal and experience.\n\nwe had 6:30 reservations but we arrived and were seated about 15 minutes early no questions asked and the night took off from there. \n\ni started the night with a brisa caliente cocktail: a conservatively spicy blend of tequila, ginger, fruit juices and chili in a rimmed glass with a shimchimi, a deliciously spicy japanese chili. although only a few days into the legal realm, i think i'll have a favorite drink for a long time coming.\n\nmy father and i split a number of dishes, including:\nspicy tempura rock shrimp: incredible array of flavors and textures. i've had similar dishes from local japanese fusion places and nobu and sushisamba's by far surpassed the competition. priced a little less with a more substantial portion, i could have been okay ordering a few of these.\n\nyellowtail and w<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> \"taquitos\": taquitos in the sense these two-a-piece small dishes were served in a mini crispy wonton-taco, the spicy aji panca sauce was drinkable by itself but added a level of sophistication that totally elevated the dish. i prefered the yellowtail over the w<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> mainly as the flavor of the fish was able to shine more than the beef. that said the beef was still really, really good.\n\n<mark>Broiled Peruvian Bay Scallop</mark>: served on the shell, these reminded me of a \"<mark>Scallop</mark> rockefeller\" of sorts, and the lime-butter crust was crispy and buttery. i'm glad they were <mark>Broiled Peruvian Bay Scallop</mark> versus their larger, more flavorful cousin since the crust was overpowering but as a single bite it was great.\n\nmiso chilean <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>: my favorite of the night, the two-skewer dish is completely melt-in-your-mouth with a perfect salty-sweet sauce. definitely the best non-<mark><mark>Osetra Caviar Imperial 20g</mark> 20g</mark> i've ever had. may be a little pricey but the flavor is just really, really good. this came with the <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark> which is now my all-time favorite vegetable...large kernels with a crazy good flavor.\n\n<mark>Sao Paulo</mark> samba roll: we were tempted by the gluttony of this everything-but-the-kitchen-sink roll and it was pretty awesome. it was a little much in the sense it's hard to differentiate everything inside, but the sauce on the side added an indescribable flavor that made it special. the roll comes with scallop, masago, red onion, tuna, salmon, shrimp, yellowtail, avocado, truffle, hacho miso soy, chive oil. wow.\n\n\"chef's inspiration\" sashimi platter: i'm a sucker for really good fish. that means i can be pretty picky, too. the platter came with 9 pieces, 3 each of sake salmon, akami tuna and yellowtail tuna. salmon included, the fish were so fatty (in the good way) and melt-on-the-toungue my father and i both were just blown away by the quality of raw fish from a restaurant which fuses japanese, brazilian and peruvian alike. \n\nraspberry sorbet w/ green tea coating: not sure what we were getting ourselves into with this, but the sweet white chocolate (?) and green tea ganache/candy-like coating paired with the super smooth and perfectly-sweet sorbet was the perfect end...and i don't generally choose fruit desserts.\n\n--\nall in all, i really cannot find any flaw in this place. i could only guess fewer-star ratings are attributed to a bad day or something because sushisamba has easily entered its way into my top 5 restaurants of all time...not an easy task. again i experienced wonderfully attentive service, great food, amazing cocktails and ended the night full and happy. not much more i could have asked for. thanks for an awesome birthday!", 
            "<mark>Seared W<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> Beef</mark> gyoza were amazing. veggies tempura was good but i really did not like the yamato roll.  i'm a fan of <mark>Foie Gras</mark> but the combination with the fish was just not good for me.  some people have a taste for it but i just don't! \nservice and ambiance were good.", 
            "since we were staying in the palazzo, i figured it would be easiest to dine in the hotel our first night in vegas. sushisamba sounded like a really interesting fusion of brazilian, peruvian, and japanese cuisine.\n\ninside i found a very lively, posh atmosphere. there was great music playing, giving it more of a club ambiance than that of a restaurant. i also liked the graffiti paint job on the walls. our waitress was tremendous, and the manager came to check on us periodically too. they definitely aren't lacking in the service department. all in all, this was a really enjoyable place to eat dinner.\n\nwe decided to go tapas style and order a bunch of different things to try. my dinner companion didn't have any preferences, so i ordered two small plates (<mark>Seared W<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> Beef</mark> <mark>Salt and Pepper Squid</mark>), two kinds of sashimi tiradito (kanpachi and tuna), and two samba rolls (<mark>Samba Strip</mark> roll and <mark>Sasa Handroll</mark>).\n\nour small plates came out first. i was excited to try the <mark>Seared W<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> Beef</mark>, which comes with a ponzu gelee, honshimeji mushrooms, and a truffled tofu crema. the meat was amazingly tender, and i liked the acidity of it all. even the mushrooms were very flavorful. the <mark>Salt and Pepper Squid</mark> was also very good. it comes with dry miso, shichimi, sea salt, crispy garlic, and smoked soy. this dish was definitely spicy. it was like calamari, but way better.\n\nnext up was the sashimi tiradito. the kanpachi (amberjack) comes with yuzu, sea salt, and black truffle oil. it was absolutely packed with flavor, and i enjoyed the saltiness of it. the tuna is served in a ceviche-style bath of granny smith apple, serrano peppers, and lime. it was beautifully sweet and spicy at the same time.\n\nwe were getting a little full, but we still had two samba rolls to go. the <mark>Samba Strip</mark> roll is a combination of <mark>Half Maine Lobster</mark>, mango, tomato, crispy rice, soy paper, and peanut curry. i absolutely loved the mango in there, which paired nicely with the peanut. the <mark>Sasa Handroll</mark> was very different from what you might expect sushi to be. it comes with <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark>, quinoa, shishito, cilantro, spicy mayonnaise, and red onion wrapped in some sort of cone. our waitress suggested we get two, since it's not very conducive to sharing. i agree. the sasa roll was a little difficult to eat, but well worth the effort. \n\ni didn't think we had waited very long for our dinner at all, but nonetheless the manager thought so, and to make up for it she brought over complimentary green tea sorbet pops for dessert. to put it mildly, they were amazing!\n\nsushisamba was absolutely top notch all the way around.", 
            "<mark>Berkshire Pork Belly</mark>: best ever. can be ordered as a small plate.\nyamoto roll: <mark>Foie Gras</mark> and osetra----unbelievable!\n<mark>Peruvian Corn</mark>: you've never had it like this. comes with many of the small plates.\nshiso ice cream: it works!\ngrilled beef: perfect char on the outside, juicy and rare on inside.\ngrilled vegetables: healthy option, not spectacular.\n\nall that plus a cocktail= $108, great value for the quality.\n\nservice was excellent.\ncan't wait to go back and try the seafood curry and the <mark>Seared W<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> Beef</mark> gyoza.", 
            "on a hungry sunday night we stumbled toward this oasis of fish, beats, and peeps. \n\nstarted off with a yellow tail taco that was the perfect mix of savory, spicy, and scrumptious. next was a <mark>Seared W<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> Beef</mark> gyoza that was super juicy on a bed of pumpkin puree that offset the fatty gyoza incredibly well. \n\nfor the rolls we got the <mark>Neo Tokyo</mark> which had a decent amount of fish and was quite tasty. the <mark>El Topo</mark> (or something like that) had an interesting concept with fried onions, melted mozzarella, and salmon, but was probably the most \"meh\" dish of the night since the fried onion took over the taste of the roll and the salmon was cooked--it was more like a baked salmon dish with lotsa cheese than a fresh sushi roll. \n\nthe winner of the night, however, was certainly the yamato. decadent in its description and decadent in execution the buttery beef created a wonderful texture as the <mark>Foie Gras</mark> melted on the tongue. my friend liked it so much that he ordered a whole second roll for himself. if i wasn't so full i would have been tempted to do the same. \n\nall in all great service and for 40ish bucks a great great meal in vegas.", 
            "came here for an early dinner with a friend on friday. \n\nit's a large open restaurant with a dark fun vibe and a good selection of drinks.  my friend and i had a couple caipirinhas and split the <mark>Seared W<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> Beef</mark> and the plate of chilean <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>.  the caipirinhas were refreshing and strong and the food was melt-in-your-mouth good.  it's definitely a fun spot to hit up for some tasty food in vegas.",

            "this is now one of my favorite restaurants in the world after my experience last night. \n\nthe sushi, ceviche, sashimi were great. the w<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> that came out with a hot river stone was amazing -- better than at any steakhouse i've ever been to. \n\nthe beer and saki are top notch. \n\nlastly, the restaurant is fun and you feel as though dinner is an event unto itself.", 
            "one of the many reasons i love the palazzo is the creepy-when-you-think-about-it facts that you can have a week long vacay and never really go outside. one of the other reasons i like the joint is... sushisamba. \n\nall fusion isn't created equal and most of what's deemed fusion in the multi-billion dollar tourist traps still doesn't cut it as top notch cuisine... but in three rotations over the years, the one thing i can say is that they've consistently delivered a good experience.  and that's more than i can say for a few others that are no longer at the palazzo.   it's also consistently noisy... do with that what you will. \n\nfavorites from the menu... <mark>Moqueca Mista</mark> (kinda hard to mess up fish stew with good ingredients ) and the <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> are my favorites of the full entries, which i wouldn't recommend on a first visit.  save big plates for your second or third go round.  almost anything with the w<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> is a hit; i think sushisamba drives the south american flavors home using fine japanese beef.  but if it works... \n\nthe yamato roll... epic as it is... to me, is **almost** overkill.  super indulgent <mark>Foie Gras</mark> and w<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> are almost a taste bud assault.   but at the same time, you have to try it-share it. the sa\\u00f5 paulo and the <mark>Neo Tokyo</mark> are my favorites here.   the <mark>Samba Strip</mark> is also pretty awesome.  again, pile enough good things together and see what happens. \n\nthe so so and not so on the menu... if anything ... rock shrimp (discontinued) and tiger <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark>.   mojitos are so so...( to me) as well.   the robata squid was literally hit and miss; had it once and it was great... and the next time... just rubber. \n\nall in all, come here with good company, a serious appetite and charge it to the room...i prefer early lunch or just after midnight.", 
            "i'm always a little skeptical of asian fusion cuisine, but this place does it right! our waitress was very helpful in guiding us through the menu, pointing out the more popular items. it is a \"tapas\" style menu, the plates are small and meant to be shared! we ordered: \n\n-<mark>Seared W<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> Beef</mark> gyoza: i think this was the best thing we ordered! the beef was soooo good and i loved the sauces on the side. \n\n-<mark>Berkshire Pork Belly</mark> ramen: everything in the ramen was very traditional, but the broth was very different from your typical bowl. it had a hint of lemongrass and some heat, which my boyfriend and i really liked (it kind of reminded us of tom yum soup). \n\n-<mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> and shrimp skewers: both came with a side of <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark>! so yummy! these are supposedly the two most popular of the anticuchos. \n\n-lima roll: a pretty standard <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark> roll. i would have rather tried another one of their small plates or tempura instead. \n\nbetween two people this was more than enough food. overall, a really great and satisfying meal with <mark>Uni</mark> flavors!", 
            "i came to this restaurant about a year ago for work related function.  at that time, my experience was very good, so i wanted to take my husband with me this time for him to experience the same.\n\nwhen we got there, the hostess set us at a table and asked us to move again because they had a reservation for party of 4, so they had to sit them there.  there were other tables with 4 people seats available, but we agreed to move.\n\nwhen i was here last time, the waiter was very nice and friendly and he had a good knowledge of the menu, especially the tasting menu options.  however, this time, we did not like our waitress.  when i decided to go there, i had tasting menu in my mind and i asked her to give me more explanations on that as i wasn't the one to order last time.   i am not sure if she was new to this place or not, but she seemed like she had no idea what the tasting menu entails or she didn't want to sell it.  she basically said that there are 3 courses and they can customize it if we had any preferences or allergies.  however, she did not say anything about what kind of foods will be on the tasting menu, whether they are from the regular menu vs off the menu items and even what kind of foods we will be served.  when i asked for difference between different tasting menu options, she basically said the quality of meat and fish are different.  everything she said was very vague.  \n\nalthough we still didn't really get much info that we wanted, since my experience last time was pretty good, we decided to do the tasting menu with the waygu hot stone bbq thing.  the few items that we got were tasty.  we liked w<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> dumpling and chilean <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> with corns.  their  ceviche taco thing was okay and we were not a big fan of the tuna appetizer that they brought out.  we got the w<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> bbq which i think is good to try it as a experience as the meat was tasty and it is a <mark>Uni</mark> experience but i am not too sure if it is worth it to pay $128 for 4 oz w<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> to grill it on a hot stone.  \n\nafter trying their tuna dish, we realized that we can have sushi in la too, so we asked the waitress to suggest something <mark>Uni</mark> to the restaurant rather than sushi or rolls which we can get other places for part of tasting menu as she said she can customize it for us. however, she couldn't really give us any suggestions or tell us how they can customize for us.  by then, we were not happy about the service and some of the foods that we tried, so we decided to cancel the tasting menu and pay for whatever we ate and left early.  \n\nmaybe my expectation was high for this place but i am really disappointed on their waitress' knowledge on their menu and some of the foods.  it was a very special night for us, so i really wanted it to be special but i have to say that dining at sushi samba definitely was not the highlight of our evening, rather more of a disappointment of the evening.  i saw every food item that we were served on the regular menu, so maybe it is better to stick with ordering off the menu rather than tasting menu and skip the w<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> hot stone bbq.  i won't be going back to this place in the future.\n\nfoods: 2.5 stars\natmosphere: 3 stars\nservice: 0 star\noverall experience: 1 star", 
            "i recently had one of the best meals of my life at sushisamba. i was visiting vegas on my own and decided to treat myself to a dinner at this restaurant that i used to love in chicago, before it shut down (sadly). it had been so long that i really got to try a lot of new things on the menu and i was in love with all of them.  i started out with a glass of sparkling rose because i'm classy like that. managers michael and jeremy gave me a primo spot to sip my bubbles and watch the fabulous crowd pour in for the dinner service. they also handed me a beautiful taster of their cucumber cocktail, which was fantastic. \n\nnext jeremy brought me over one of the yellow tail taquitos, which had a crisp shell and a flavorful foam to spoon on top. it was a great amuse bouche. along with that, i ordered the <mark>Seared W<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> Beef</mark> gyoza. the beef just melted in your mouth. it was so good. i tried to slow myself down to savor every bite of the tender meat in the dumplings. the sauce that came with them was also an integral part of their savory goodness. i think i could eat those dumplings every day until the day i die and still ask for them in heaven (or hell, depending on where i end up). \n\nthe next dish i ordered was the yamato sushi, which sounded like the absolute most decadent sushi roll i could ever possibly order. and it was. and i loved it. starting with white sushi rice, topped with flavorful fresh tuna, the smallest most perfect piece of <mark>Foie Gras</mark>, a dot of caviar, and topped with gold flake. i mean come on. i felt like the queen of sheba! each bite was a beautiful rich, even slightly sweet (from the sauce) morsel. it felt light and sinful at the same time.\n\nthen, michael stopped by to check on me and suggested i order the <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> robata. two skewers of meaty <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> grilled with a delicious miso sauce. they were the perfect bite to pair with the giant <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark> kernels served on the side. and i ordered mashed purple potatoes to top off the meal. everything was cooked to perfection. i just felt so grateful and happy to be there.\n\nwhen it came time for dessert, i was so full that all i wanted was coffee. so i ordered an espresso with a single scoop of chocolate ice cream, which was a great finish to an amazing meal. then michael and jeremy brought me one more surprise: an ice cream pop. mango ice cream covered with a white chocolate shell and graham cracker.\n\neverything was just awesome. michael and jeremy did a great job, as did my server, also named michael. amazing dinner in a really fun city. beautiful decor. they really made me feel right at home!",

            "in early may i was in las vegas on business and wanted to entertain some colleagues for dinner. we were a party of eleven and with that many pallets to please, we needed something different, we needed sushisamba. \n\na couple people in the group had been here before and spoke highly of the fusion restaurant, but for many of us this would be our first time so we made a reservation for 7pm. typically when we travel for business there is always one or two people who join your group at the last minute, so we held a table for thirteen just in case. \n\nmost of us arrived to the restaurant on time however two people were running a few minutes late but on their way. unfor<mark>Tuna</mark> because we were not a party of ten, the server refused to seat us, even though it would only be a few minutes for them to arrive. she also said they could only hold our reservation for 10 minutes.  needless to say, they arrived in time, but i thought that it was not only a poor business decision to seat us early (most people will enjoy a cocktail or two while waiting) but just rude. \n\nwe were seated in the far back of the restaurant and the servers were very attentive. they quickly explained the brazilian-peruvian-japanese fusion concept of the restaurant and then without missing a beat he began to pitch us on the \"chef's choice\" option to the menu. i will admit, it was a good pitch, but obviously too good to be true. with this option the chef would listen to our likes and dislikes and create dishes that appeal to our tastes based on our budget, much like when dining at a chef's table.  the catch to this.... the restaurant was packed, there is no way the kitchen is creating anything special for us.... they're just serving menu items that will maximize your budget and increase your check. \n\nsadly five of us fell for it and ordered the \"chef's choice\" menu, the rest of us ordered ala carte and decided we would share plates amongst each other and asked for separate checks.  funny enough most of the plates that were being served off the \"chef's choice\" menu were the same plates we ordered, but with a few exceptions.  the food was good.  it by no means blew me away, but nothing i ate was bad and i really cant find anything negative to say about it. we had a number of small dishes that included edamame, <mark>Seaweed Salad</mark>, rock shrimp and <mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark>, plus an assortment of sushi rolls. \n\nthe checks came and as expected the \"chef's choice\" total was nearly $100 more than the ala carte (and we had an extra person).  i signed the bill, put the receipt in my wallet and didn't look at it again until i got back to the office and had to submit my expenses. \n\nas i reviewed the bill i took notice to the quantities of the plates ordered. we specifically ordered different items knowing that we were sharing, so i was surprised to see that i had duplicates on five items. i know we all liked the rock shrimp and ordered another plate, so that wasn't a concern. however there was only one other questionable roll that no one recalls ordering and the other three were definitely not ordered, delivered or consumed.... but we paid for it. \n\nwe aren't talking about a lot of money here - $36 - $55, but it's the fact we were obviously taken advantage of.  maybe the waiter wanted a bigger tip, perhaps the restaurant wanted to recoup some funds because we didn't take the \"chef's choice\"? either way i wrote the management group letting them know of my disappointment.  in the end i got an email from the general manager offering to return my $36 with an apology. \n\n\nas a chef, when i am dining out i expect my experience to meet an acceptable level of expectations that may differ from others, however lets face it, with so many choices available these days a restaurant has to be spot on to keep you coming back.  apparently in this case sushisamba needs the money more than i do as i will not be going back.", 
            "the classy ambiance, fast service and freshness of the fish are just a few things that i loved about this place! the <mark>Seared W<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> Beef</mark> gyozas and tempura string beans are to die for not to mention the cocktails are absolutely delightful! our server, vanessa, was such a sweetheart too. she surprised my best friend and i with birthday desserts which made for a perfect touch to our dinner. ask for that beautiful babe and she will definitely take care of you. i highly recommend this place. you will be just as impressed as we were!", 
            "came here for dinner and was pleasantly surprised with how good it was! we had the <mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> and rock shrimp as an appetizer - both were amazing! the service was really good, we went with all of our servers suggestions for apps, sushi rolls, and dessert and were never disappointed. the samba split dessert was one of the best i've ever had (and i eat a lot of dessert!). pricey, but so is everything else in vegas, definitely worth it.", 
            "first time here. house wine was ok. i bet their cocktails are great. there are many selection of\ncocktails and sake but i've been drinking wine the whole evening so i'll try it next time! <mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> is very tasty!! it's a must!!", 
            "my new favorite restaurant in vegas! service was amazing and the food was impeccable. \n\nwe had the nashi and brisa caliente drink. both were amazing! highly recommend the waygu <mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark>. no words to describe how perfect it is!!", 
            "this was honestly the best dining experience i've had in this price bracket. mimi was a very fun, sharp and attentive bartender and the male bartender was extremely informed on the menu and very quick with taking care of us as well.\n\nwe ordered the lemon samurai and nina fresh as cocktails and <mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> as an appetizer. the gyoza was so good we ordered a second set. i got a teriyaki chicken and my girlfriend  had the chilean <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>. \n\nthe nina fresa was sweet, mellow and complex with a guava juice base and a tang of strawberry. the samurai was sharp, with a nice kick.\n\nthe gyoza, like i said, was so good we ordered two. it was tender and done medium. it came with a squash puree and a dipping sauce, which added the sweetness to it.\n\nthe <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> was ridiculously juicy, the vegetables fresh and well grilled, and the sauce very savory. my girlfriend said it was the best fish dish she ever had.\n\nmy chicken was remarkable. the meat was juicy and tender, the skin crisp. the teriyaki sauce was made in house and had a spicy aftertaste. it came with crispy onions which accentuated the crispy skin. everything was on top of <mark>Purple Potato Mash</mark> potatoes, not greatly different from <mark><mark>Osetra Caviar Imperial 20g</mark> 20g</mark>, but with an aji amarillo sauce, which was like a mix between squash puree and salty broth.\n\nthe service was fast and friendly and flawless. they gave great recommendations and were very patient. they reprint your bill with every order so you know exactly what you've added up.", 
            "sushi samba was great! overall everything was delicious! but one concern would be the portion sizes in comparison with the prices.\nfirst, we had the <mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> and they were delicious! very juicy and great sauce. they were pretty small though. \nthen we had the sashimi that came with 9 pieces: yellowtail, tuna, and salmon. the fish was not as fresh as i would like, but my brother and sister liked it. \nthe last thing was the grilled <mark>Scallop</mark> with <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark>. the corn was the best part. the <mark>Scallop</mark> were coated with a very sweet sauce. \nour waiter nick was a very handsome man with a beautiful smile! the servers were all professional and good looking! the service was great and very welcoming! i would definitely come back!!", 
            "great quality seafood and <mark>Seared W<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> Beef</mark>, but everything generally ran sweet, or very salty. we ordered the <mark>Whole Squid</mark> with <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark>, yamato roll, <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> skewer, and <mark>Seared W<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> Beef</mark>.\n\nto start with my favorite, the w<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> was amazing. the jelly that it comes with on the side however was very salty, so use it sparingly. the yamato roll and <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> skewer were both too sweet - i guess this could be part of the fusion thing, but it was really too sweet for my palate. the <mark>Whole Squid</mark> was very, very good, but also too salty.\n\ni let the manager know that it was my boyfriend's birthday, and he came by at the end with mango ice cream pops and a candle! it was a yummy dessert to end with.",

            "wow, what do i say?\n\nthis place blew us out of the water. \n\ni'd gotten recommendations to dine here if i ever visited vegas. those people are on top of their food game. (looking at you aj) \n\nsometimes, places are hyped up and i end up having a disappointing meal, even if it was good. this place was not that.\n\nour server, jeff, was friggen awesome. he was so friendly and informative. he really knew his stuff and he didn't give us any pressure. super attentive also, he came around like 3 times while we were going over the menu to see if we needed help. we ended up going with an omakase style of ordering. we gave him a budget of $80pp and told him our must haves and to just wing the rest. he did an excellent job.\n\nnotable dishes:\njapanese a5 <mark>Seared W<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> Beef</mark> gyoza  - when this dish came out, i was a bit underwhelmed. it just looked like bland dumplings on a plate, but the texture and taste of this was just amazing. it was melt in your mouth, different textured, simple but tasty flavours. i would definitely have more of this.\n\nassorted sashimi & rolls - the fish was really fresh here. any of the sashimi would be a good choice. i can't remember what rolls we got, but they were generally really good. there was one that was a bit bland and i believe it was shrimp inside. \n\n<mark>Duck Breast</mark> - okay, so.. no joke. this dish ruined mushrooms and duck for me. after our table had this, we couldn't stop raving about it. my mouth is watering just thinking about it right now. a whole <mark>Duck Breast</mark>, skin and fat on, seared a perfect medium rare, served on a bed of assorted mushrooms in an asian liqour sauce. holy moly my, this was so good. definitely the best thing we had all night.\n\nso, given that our budget we gave was $80pp, it came up to around $115pp after tax and tip (and we gave a generous tip), and this included a dessert platter (which was delicious as well) and a beer each too. \n\nthis is a definite must in vegas! 6 stars if i could.", 
            "amazing doesn't begin to describe the experience my boyfriend and i had here the other night. we wanted to grab dinner before checking out frank the man the music and decided to pop into this location at the palazzo. the entire staff was so attentive, from nonstop refills on our soda to very customized suggestions on different menu items. we had carmine and he was awesome! we went with a three course approach for two and couldn't have been happier with what we chose (<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark>, neo roll, the duck, <mark>Filet Mignon</mark>, and chilean <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>). the manager jeff came over to speak to us and brought over some additional items to try - such a great touch to our experience.  can't rave about this place enough - we will definitely be coming back here on our next trip to vegas! thank you for a great experience! :)", 
            "great customer service! we had them pick items off the menu for us and the ones that stood out the most were the <mark>Seared W<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> Beef</mark> potstickers and the <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> skewers, both of which were very mouth watering. definitely come back again.", 
            "i have eaten here a lot for dinner throughout the years. we were in search of a great lunch. we found it here at sushisamba. we had the perfect lunch to get us through a busy day in vegas. we had the seared w<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> small plate (always my favorite-i always order this), <mark>Coconut Rice</mark>, the <mark>Samba Strip</mark> roll and the yuzu tart cheesecake. everything was delicious and had great presentation. i loved that is was not loud and overcrowded at lunch. we had just the perfect lunch. the specialty drinks are a must. i can't remember the names, but one that had japanese whiskey in it with pineapple was absolutely delicious. i highly recommend it. the general manager, jeremy made our lunch extra special with a tasting of a new dish of cooked <mark>Scallop</mark> with a pesto sauce that was dynamite and the miso marinated <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> dish. everything was amazing and not heavy. the <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> to our surprise was our favorite dish, but there wasn't anything we tried that wasn't delicious. it was so moist and had so much flavor. i love this menu because it is diverse and there is something for everyone's specific taste buds and you can easily share if you'd like. my husband really enjoyed the experience here. thank you to jeremy for a great experience along with the wonderful wait staff. if you want a meal that is diverse in flavor and presentation and will leave you full, but not heavy and uncomfortable-this is the perfect place. you get the full package here with great service and delicious food. well worth it.",

            "i've stayed at the venetian/palazzo a dozen times and had never eaten at sushi samba. what a terrible mistake i've made all these years. looking for a restaurant in the hotel for our bachelor party, we decided upon sushisamba due to the variety of dishes, the vibrant atmosphere, and positive word of mouth reviews. we made a reservation through opentable, and were promptly seated upon arrival.\n\nsamba proclaims to have the most extensive sake selection in vegas, and we let our server choose a cheaper bottle for us and it was delicious. \n\n1) japanese a5 <mark>Seared W<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> Beef</mark> gyoza (4.5/5) - you get 5 delicious pot stickers with quality beef that just melts in your mouth\n\n2) yellowtail taquito (5/5) - there are two mandatory dishes to get and this is one of them. essentially a mini taco with yellowtail, roasted corn miso, and avocado. the explosion of flavor was mind-numbingly good and even friends who don't enjoy seafood loved this\n\n3) yellowtail sashimi (4.5/5) - 4 slices of high quality yellowtail, the sauce is delicate and sour\n\n4)  <mark>Berkshire Pork Belly</mark> (3.75/5) - i am admittedly biased towards <mark>Berkshire Pork Belly</mark> so i loved the dish. the butterscotch miso on top was a little overwhelming but the <mark>Berkshire Pork Belly</mark> itself was cooked to perfection\n\n5) <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> anticucho (5/5) - this is the other mandatory dish. we were very for<mark>Tuna</mark> because the table next to us came 15 minutes after and they ran out of this dish! the <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> skewer is  their signature dish and deservedly so. two skewers of <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> cooked so perfectly (soft on inside, slightly crispy exterior), there aren't enough superlatives to describe how delicious it is. \n\n6) <mark>Rio Grande</mark> (4/5) - from their churrasco menu, includes three types of meat: ribeye, chorizo, and w<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> picanha. i would not suggest this if you are eating by yourself or with another because it is just so much meat. in a larger group setting, i think this dish is perfect to share. the w<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> picanha is my favorite because the meat was so soft and tender.\n\nquite simply, i loved my experience at sushisamba. the service was fantastic. the food was <mark>Uni</mark> and delicious at the same time. the atmosphere embodies that of vegas- vibrant and exciting. the price of the dinner was what i'd expect from a \"strip\" restaurant, so be prepared to spend at least $50. \n\ni can't wait to go back to sushisamba for some yellowtail tacos and <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>.", 
            "like many things on the strip, sushisamba is an overpriced over the top version of something you could find off the strip. it's tough to rate restaurants on the strip merely because of the price tag but ignoring the inflation, i thought samba had a good vibe, fairly good/quick service, and a decent amount of tasty tapas/appetizers. ironically, i hated all their sushi (mushy, bland sushi rice is no bueno).\n\ni love the concept of samba, and stick with the appetizers and small plates. \n\nthings i liked\n- <mark>Mushroom Tobanyaki</mark>: half mushrooms, half butter. delicious.\n- <mark>Seared W<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> Beef</mark>: small but good.\n\npretty good:\n- <mark>Crispy Jidori Egg</mark>: mostly crispy stuff, not enough eggy goodness\n- <mark>Broiled Peruvian Bay Scallop</mark>: \n\ndo not get:\n- any of the sushi",

            "sushi samba has been a hit or miss with yelpers, and here's my chance to check them out!  featuring a special \"election day menu\" with specialty cocktails and cheap appetizers, it was a perfect opport<mark>Uni</mark>!\n\ndrinks on the menu:\n* obamarama (blue) for $11 \"svedka citron, blue curacao apple liqueur, guava, blueberry\" - really good the first time around. pleasant to look at and just tasty-good.  the guys and gals enjoyed this drink.  the second time i ordered it, there was way too much alcohol though, and not in a good way.  a good cocktail should be enjoyable to drink; i passed the second one off.\n\n* maverick (red) for $11 \"pearl vodka, freshly muddled strawberries, orange liqueur, lime, guava\" - served in a martini glass, so a bit more delicate to drink.  pretty tasty as well. i enjoyed it.\n\nbites to eat:\n* shishito peppers ($2) \"grilled spicy peppers, sea salt and lemon\" - they give you a bunch of these peppers on a plate, and it was okay for me.  i tried one and found that to be good enough.  didn't really care for more.\n\n* <mark>Organic Chicken</mark> aji amarillo anticucho ($2) - i found the chicken to be okay, but really enjoyed the <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark> that came with the dish.  that was the best part of it.  our order had one skewer of chicken, but the party next to us had two? hmm... \n\n* spicy crunchy tuna roll ($3) - really good roll!  i liked this a lot and ordered myself another.  i like how they do their spicy sauce here; it's more mayonnaise-based.  and the slight crunch is nice too.\n\n* <mark>Salmon Avocado</mark> roll ($3) - pretty simple roll with just salmon and avocado.  but it was fresh fish and good.  i'm sad i didn't order more.\n\n* mini chicharron de calamar ($3) \"cornmeal crusted calamari with tamarind sauce, tomato salsa & plantain\" - our friend's order came out soggy, so they thought it was gross.  ours had a better crunch on it, so it tasted better.  it wasn't particularly exceptional, it was okay.  i don't remember any plantain in my dish though.  \n\n* japanese chicken wings ($4) \"teriyaki and sesame\" - it's hard to go wrong with teriyaki chicken wings, right?  good, but messy.\n\n* chilled oyster sampler ($4) \"ponzu jelly & tobiko with three oysters\" - really fresh oysters with an interesting ponzu jelly.  we were supposed to get another order before we left, so i missed out on more!  next time!\n\n* mini yellowtail seviche ($4) \"ginger garlic and soy\" - reminded me of hawaiian poke with the dressing.  it was good with the red onions mixed in there, more poke-like than ceviche-like though.\n\n* crispy yellowtail taquitos ($4) \"shiso, avocado, roasted corn miso and spicy aji panca sauce\" \\u00e2\" two different sauces to put over the taquitos, and it was good.  very messy though as it broke apart after the first bite and was dripping all over my hands.  our order came with two taquitos, but when our friend ordered it, he only got one!\n\n* rosca ($9) \"homemade doughnuts with hazelnut chocolate dipping sauce\" \\u00e2\" recommended by our bartender/waitress as her favorite dessert.  four doughnut holes arrived and they were just okay.  disappointing for us, and we wished we had chosen another dessert instead.\n\nwe spent the whole time at the bar because there was standing room only at this event.  so, the girl making our drinks also served us.  she was busy but tried her best to make our drinks were full and our orders were in.  (our drinks were good for the most part except for that second obamarama we ordered.  but hey, some people like more alcohol in their cocktails!)  i had a bigger problem with the kitchen output and their consistency.  with certain orders coming out, sometimes you got two of something and other times you got one.  our friend mentioned that we got more sushi in our order than when he ordered it.  (makes you wonder what happened to the other pieces.)\n\noverall, we had a decent experience at sushi samba.  you definitely can't beat the price and the atmosphere is casual, which is nice alternative at a strip hotel.\n\n3.5 stars.\n\nthey also offer a happy hour (sunday through thursday from 4 to 7 pm, and then a reverse happy hour from 10 pm to close), available in the bar area only.\n\n(pics posted, of course!)", 
            "this place should change their name to <mark>Samba Sushi</mark> because sushi is definitely the secondary focus of their menu. i ordered the classics: <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> and <mark>Salmon Avocado</mark>. how can you mess that up? the sushi was fresh but absolutely flavorless with no kick. also, for some reason, their wasabi was diluted in intensity as well. \n\ni mean, i know you have to focus on two different types of foods thar originated on 2 different continents but i've been to japanese/portuguese fusion restaurants in brazil and they get it on point! word of advice to the chef/owner: take a trip to brazil and learn how the pros get it done.", 
            "i had such a delightful experience here. everything was amazing from the service to the food. \n\nservice:\ni got seated right away and got service right away. our waiter was amazing. he was oh so attentive and fast as hell with our order and everything else. there are plenty of people running around taking empty plates from your table and refilling your water...which is super important considering you're in las vegas and are probably dehydrated from the night before or from moments before. \ni asked where the restroom was and i was escorted there and once i got to the restroom there was an attendant that escorted me to the correct stall. \n\nfood:\nthe miso cilantro soup is da bomb. go ahead and try it would ya? \ni'm no sushi fan at all but my bf insisted on me trying his eel avocado roll and <mark>Salmon Avocado</mark> roll...holy crap...i like sushi!! these are probably the first sushi rolls i enjoyed. total yum-sicles and magical <mark>Uni</mark> to go along with it. \ni also had the fillet mignon which was flippin good. \n\nlong story short (too late), try this place. it's dope. i will be coming back when i'm in town.", 
            "sushisamba is always on my itinerary when i come out here for my annual birthday celebration/vacation. i came here two days ago after my wonderful massage, all excited, hungry, and ready to throw down on some food, so i was glad i made it just in time for the happy hour. to my surprise, service was kind of amiss: my order initially came out wrong, my caipirinha was off and had to be adjusted, the salmon in my <mark>Salmon Avocado</mark> roll was a little dark, and the mosquitoes flying around me and my food drove me nuts! the only saving grace was the <mark>Berkshire Pork Belly</mark> and the plantains, which were excellent (the mosquitoes thought so too).\n\ni really hope sushisamba isn't slacking off on what made them my fave in the first place :/ sushi don't fail me now...", 
            "so we just finished a late night meal here. i consider me and my fianc\\u00e9 to be sushi connoisseurs. we found it to be just 'meh. but than again, we have been blown away at other restaurants and after all this is a chain....\n\nanyway, we got here after 11pm and were seated. we specifically came here for the happy hour but were told after being seated, happy hour menu is at the bar only. you mean the 15 seat bar? we don't drink so i declined. not to forget, it's no where stated on the menu... our mediocre late night snack came to $70....\n\nshould stuck to my rule of only dining where the locals go. \n\n<mark>Salt and Pepper Squid</mark>- good. not overly fried. lime was nice touch.\n\n<mark>Samba Strip</mark>, <mark>Salmon Avocado</mark> and <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark>... nothing fancy and have had way better.",

            "alright, now were getting to the good stuff. \n\nand by \"good\" i mean un-fucking-believable. yea, i said it. unreal. never have i wanted to pick up and move to vegas so much in all of my life, but i'm thinking about it after the dinner i had at sushisamba's new ultra lounge, sugarcane. this is an incredible statement for me because for one, i can only take vegas in small doses, and two, i despise the heat. so having said that you can believe me when i say that i love absolutely everything about sushisamba, the brazilian/peruvian/japanese fusion restaurant at the palazzo. \n\nwhere do i begin?\n\noh yes, holy mary mother of god, i've died and gone to heaven...\n\na friend of mine is the publicist for this new restaurant, as well as the brand spanking new, sugarcane. she hooked up a dinner reservation for me and some friends so that we could celebrate my good friend's birthday in style. upon our (late) arrival we were greeted warmly by the wait staff, as they explained to us that our party would be the very first members of the public to sit down to dinner in their brand new ultra lounge. as we walked through the dimly lit hallway, past the dj booth and dance floor, and into the dining area portion of sugarcane we were immediately taken back by the overall design concept of the space. i\"m gonna do my best to do it justice but i would highly recommend a trip here to experience for yourself because it is just too complex for words...\n\nthe walls are covered with graffiti-style murals of samurais and japanese script, the dance floor has a canvas like screen that wraps around the circular pods that make up the women's bathrooms (see pics) where they project abstract imagery to coincide with the music playing. the dj that night was claudio who i wanted to put in my pocket and take home because the music was just that dope. there are multi-colored glass cylinders that hang from the ceiling and beams of light (see pics) that separate the dance floor from the dining area that change from red to orange to white that create a truly magnificent effect. \n\nthe food and service is on a level that is even harder to explain - it was incredible. our waiter anthony took such good care of us we felt as though we were old friends by the time we left. of course, we were the first to be seated and the last to leave, so i guess if you spend enough time with your waiter (four hours) you begin to feel like family. our sake sommelier was a hilariously funny girl (i forgot her name) and very helpful and knowledgeable when describing our sake selections. we ended up choosing a bottle with gold leaf cherry blossoms there were supposedly good luck if you found them floating in your drink. \n\nour table decided to order the signature sushisamba 7-course omakase ($70 per person) as our dinner selection. anthony asked us if we had any food allergies or other special requests before going back to the kitchen to get our party started. our first course was a selection of appetizers (see pics) which included the kobe beef carpaccio with <mark>Mixed <mark>Wild Mushrooms</mark></mark>, seared ahi tuna on a tiny bed of spinach, and (my favorite) tiny ceviche fish tacos with a chili foam sauce that was amazing! next up was the best snow crab i have ever tasted, <mark>Filet Mignon</mark>, duck, chilan <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> (unreal), grilled tomatoes, fish jowel (i forget what kind) and the most beautiful sashimi plate i've ever seen/tasted. just when we thought we couldn't eat any more came the sushi course. a stand out roll was the kobe beef wrapped roll with (from what i can remember) a <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark>, cucumber and avocado center. as we sat back in our booth contemplating exactly how we were planning on walking out of there, anthony presented the birthday girl with an incredible chocolate fondue plate (see pics) complete with japanese-style sesame rice krispies, japanese cake, homemade marshmallows, and a selection of fruit. there were also mini fruit tacos with both mango and banana, with a chocolate mousse and caram<mark>El Topo</mark>. \n\ndo you see what i'm talking about?????\n\nhere's the rundown....\n\nparty <mark><mark>Assortment of Four</mark></mark>:\nfirst round of cocktails (on the house)\nseveral cocktails to follow\nbottle of premium sake\n7- course omakase dinner for four ($70 each)\nafter dinner cocktails\ndivine dessert platter\n\ntotal bill: approx $600\n\nnot bad i'd say. not bad at all. \n\nall in all, i plan to go back to visit several times over. anyone who stumbles upon this place should consider themselves lucky to be in the presence of such foodie excellence. this dinner made our entire trip, and made for a very, very happy birthday girl. \n\nsushisamba: the wait staff, the owner, the managers, the dj. you rock my rock-n-roll world.", 
            "i was worried about eating at a brand new chain on the strip. i expected to overpay for the quality of food, and get a ton of attitude from the staff. i was pleasantly surprised. \n\nmy friend and i decided to go with the $80 omasake (yes they spell it funny) tasting menu. we asked what was on it, and the waiter said he'd just pick out food around our budget and requests. this seemed odd, but we went with it. we told him we eat everything and to surprise us. i'm trying to remember everything we got, but i'm sure i'm forgetting some things: \n\nedamame/tempura green beans/roasted peppers: wow, one of my fav dishes. everything was salty and delicious, and the sauce that came with it was to die for. get this for $16.. yes.. it sounds pricey, but trust me, just get it. \n\nyellowtail sashimi.. seemed to be in a red pepper preparation? fresh, delicious, and tasty\n\nyellowtail taco.. delicious, but be warned it's messy! \n\nshrimp mango ceviche.. very good, large portion. \n\nsteak and asparagus tempura.. steak was good, but not as jaw dropping as the fish honestly.\n\nsushi rolls: spider roll, <mark>Neo Tokyo</mark>, and i wish i could remember the name of the last one, but it was incredible and had crab meat. i am not a <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> girl.. usually the meat isn't fresh and the sauce is too goopy. this was the most incredible and fresh <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> i've ever had. \n\n\nthe fondue dessert was awesome! very fun and tons of different stuff to dip in. \n\noverall an awesome experience and staff was great.. fresh chopsticks/plates/soy sauce bowls after every couple courses.", 
            "i was really excited about coming here after reading some of these reviews. this is gonna be a long one, please hang in there. \n\nreading about the omakase experiences was what got me interested. i'll spare you the details on the interior. (aunny d. explained it perfectly) the place is just fricken nice, beautifully decorated and the perfect hang out spot. they hired very attractive hostesses that were extremely friendly. the service we received from our waiter and the staff was simply awesome. \n\nnow for the food.....\n\nwe had a party of 5 and our original plan was to order both <mark><mark>Osetra Caviar Imperial 20g</mark> 20g</mark>($100) and the sushi samba omakase ($80). after going through the menu, we decided to order up a variety of items rather than go with the omakase. this way, you end up getting food that would be in the omakase anyway, more food (omakase 7 -course), and for less. \n\n\"small plates\" and \"seviches & tiraditos\"  (<mark>Grade A5</mark> a to f)\n\n<mark>Tuna Tataki</mark>  - (c+) chef overuses tatsoi that practically kills the dish\n\nseared kobe beef -(f) just not worth it. mushrooms overwhelms it\n\nchicharron de calamar - (a) excellent and generous amount!\n\nsashimi seviches - (b) grapefruit juice, jalape\\u00f1o, almond + \npassionfruit,  cucumber, cilantro \n\nsashimi tiraditos - (d) yellowtail jalape\\u00f1o and lemongrass + salmon orange and mustard miso\n\nsushi is obviously the trendy thing to have on a restaurants menu. sushi samba serves up some of the most below average sashimi and sushi. for $33, we had the <mark>Samba Sushi</mark> and sashimi combo. the sashimi was nice and thick.  both salmon and yellowtail were quite good, but the tuna was poorly prepared and lacked any freshness. the sushi was a complete joke. you get a small wafer thin slice of sashimi on a rabbit dropping sized glob of rice. most japanese restaurants, for any combo sushi plate, give you two pieces each - tuna, salmon, and yellowtail. sushi samba gives you one. my whole table thought this was a complete joke and ripoff. it doesnt end here....we ordered 4 different rolls. guess what? they're all puny and only have 4 pieces averaging $10-$20 each. we also ordered the 5 hand roll special ($28) which was okay, but the soy wrap just doesnt work. \n\nnow here's how we felt that the chefs were completely lazy or inexperienced. the sushi rice had no vinegar flavor and that is a must for sushi rice. plus, they used old rice because we had some hard dried pieces in our rolls. overall, i would not waste any money on sushi here. it's a complete insult to customers. \n\nour final dish was the 5 meat churrasco: grilled hanger steak, ribeye, pork tenderloin, chorizo, ling\\u00fci\\u00e7a with malagueta pepper oil and chimichurri.  - this dish was fantastic. the meat, cooked medium, was tender and juicy. (a+)\n\nnow, we had a total of about 16-17 items of various things off the menu. more than double than what you'll get in a omakase.  we had about 5 bottles of japanese beers. our cost  per person was $92 with tax and tip included. (5 people) \n\ni would love to come back just for the atmosphere and the churrasco. its simply a cool place to hang out and drink. dont come here for the japanese food. go to a real japanese restaurant for the omakase. just seeing how the sushi, sashimi, and rolls are prepared makes me question the chef's experience in preparing a true omakase.  \n\nif you actually read this whole thing. thanks!", 
            "waiting for my friends at the bar located near their entrance, i had a good feeling about this place.  it had all the bells and whistles of a nice upscale restaurant with a friendly bartender to start.  unfor<mark>Tuna</mark> my good feeling about this place was short lived as our party was seated.\n\nour reservation was for 9:15 pm sunday night.  we didn't get seated until 9:45 pm despite having our whole party there by 9:00 pm.  i didn't care too much for this considering the place was moderately busy on a holiday weekend, and we weren't on a strict schedule.  so i let this roll easily off my back.\n\nas we were seated, we were greeted by our waiter who was terribly unenthusiastic about his job.  he was considerate about asking  for food allergies.  beyond that, all levels of consideration or customer service for that matter stopped there.  granted, he warned us that our food would come out infrequently, but little did we know it would delay our dinner by over an hour.  a little honesty would have been greatly appreciated.  it took forever for most of our food to come out.  we didn't have utensils or place settings even after our food was delivered.  my friend even asked for the manager, to complain about our horrible service, or lack thereof.  the manager's response was something like: \"things are are a bit backed-up, we'll give you free dessert.\"  now, i don't care how backed-up your kitchen is... that's still no excuse for horrible and incompetent service!  dessert only puts a band-aid on a broken arm... why the hell do restaurant managers  do this?  we are not looking to get something free, we just want to make sure they get their act together... and fast!\n\nour original waiter rarely came to our table after we ordered our food.  another waitress came to our aid who was very helpful and attentive to our needs.  she was very friendly and courteous, it's unfor<mark>Tuna</mark> she wasn't our original waiter because this review would've been completely different.\n\nour unpleasant waiter did the weirdest thing.  as my friend was talking to the manager, being very open about our waiters horrible service, our waiter stood by our table as he refolded all our used napkins, tossing them onto our table.  yes, our used clothe napkins.  who does that?  in front of a party that is pretty disgusted by you no less.  it seemed as if he knew he was already in hot water and didn't give a rats-ass about making up for it.  in addition, he circled the portion of our bill they decided to discount for the unsatisfied service in a stuck-up negative manner.  in hind site, my friend said we should have taken that same pen, in front of our waiter, and scratched out his tip!  of course, we're better than that.\n\nthe food is the only reason why this place is not getting a single star. the food was actually quite good with a variety of <mark>Uni</mark> asian-fusion plates.  i ordered the chicken teriyaki (exotic right?) which was much more than i bargained for.  for such a simple dish, it had a variety of <mark>Uni</mark> flavors with a side of extras that complimented each bite.  my friends ordered an array of food that looked just as good, and was commented on just the same.\n\nfor me, customer service will make or break any experience, no matter how good the food is.  in this case, their service failed horribly.  our party ended up with a waiter that was a few cans short of a six pack regarding personality, who would probably fare better as a chippendale's greeter than a restaurant waiter.  i hope management recognizes this and hires waiters that are actually qualified to interact with human beings.", 
            "modern chic fusion restaurant in the new palazzo hotel, featuring brazilian and japanese food. the interior much reminded me of social house in treasure island, dark and swanky. the small plates are meant for sharing, but the tab adds up quick. the server proclaimed their sake menu as the largest in the country, but unfor<mark>Tuna</mark> we didn't get to try any.\n\nwe had the <mark><mark>Assortment of Four</mark></mark> sashimi which were nice and fresh with delicate flavors. my favorite was the tuna with granny smith apple, serrano, and lime.\n\nthe <mark>Hamachi Kama</mark> (yellowtail cheek) was as good as i've had, but missing the grated daikon that it <mark><mark>Osetra Caviar Imperial 20g</mark> 20g</mark> comes with.\n\nchicken liver anticuchos (two skewers served over <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark>) were very livery. i expected them to be only lightly livery, like my favorite pho ga place serves up, not sure if it's due to the prep or the <mark>Grade A5</mark> liver or what.\n\nwe also tried a couple rolls, the <mark>Neo Tokyo</mark> with yellowfin tuna, tempura flake, aji panca. i liked this one more than the bobo brazil with seared kobe beef, avocado, kaiware, shiso, red onion, chimichurri. the kobe beef looked raw rather than seared, maybe seared would have brought out the flavors a bit. both rolls were pretty good though.\n\nthe standout of the meal was the <mark>Berkshire Pork Belly</mark> butterscotch miso, which was meltingly tender, with a subtle sweetness contrasting the richness of the luscious pork.\n\nwe also tried the little tiny crabs we saw in an ad, sawagani, which are flash fried japanese river crabs. these were literally tiny, and the small bite had a texture like an egg shell, with a flavor best described as a subtle fish sauce.\n\ncome here if you have an appetite for a variety of small bites with delicate but well thought out flavors.", 
            "i agree with the reviews below, they did a great job of explaining the menu in more detail than i could.  gave this place 4 stars for originality of food and drinks, and the atmosphere.  it was not too dark, not too bright, with artsy decor on the walls and different pictures rotating on projection screens (not pg rated, btw, i saw a breast or two flash by, though there were nice scenic pics in there too.)  they have a club/lounge in the back of the restaurant, which was recommended to us by a dior employee at caesars mall, he said it was a mix of hip hop music and some other music, he went on a saturday.  however, we weren't able to go since it's not open on sundays.\n\nme and two other girlfriends of mine went here late on a sunday nite (sat 10 pm?) and there was no wait.  not that this matters, but an added bonus was that our waiter was hot!  hehe.  anyways, the menu had a lot of things that i had never heard of before, so if you're not used to brazilian / peruvian / japanese food then the staff should be able to explain it all to you before you order.\n\nwe ordered the tuna ceviche and shrimp ceviche for appetizers (see reviews below for details of the dishes i talk about here).  both excellent, and fresh, and a decent-sized portion (about a cereal bowl full), but pricey at around $15-17 each.  we also ordered <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> rolls, which were excellent (the tuna practically melted in our mouths) as well as the bobobrazil roll, which mr. hottie waiter recommended - slices of kobe beef atop a roll with a bunch of good stuff in it that i didn't know (sorry to all you food buffs!).  i think it was a mix of onions?  both very good.\n\nas far as cocktails, i would definitely recommend the chu-cucumber cocktail.  i think that's the name of it.  again, mr. hottie waiter recommended this, which i decided to try even though it didn't sound good at first.  it was surprisingly refreshing!  it has some sort of japanese liquor in it, which supposedly had a lite vodka flavor, as well as roseflower and cucumber.  i ended up having two of these (they were in a martini glass), and the third having substituted the original liquor for gin, as a recommendation by the bartender, which had a stronger alcohol taste to it.  one of my friends tried the samba juice cocktail, which she said was good and tasted a little like sangria.\n\noverall, great atmosphere, a bit pricey, but original food that you wouldn't find at your regular sushi restaurant.  i would definitely try this place at least once on a trip to vegas!  hopefully i'll get to check out the lounge next time!", 
            "i agree with an early reviewer that sushi samba is a pretty nice date place.  the first time i went to sushi samba was back in early august, and my date and i tried the calamari appetizer with plantains and that was tasty.  the big hit of the night though were my nina fresa cocktails and the chocolate fondue.  they were absolutely fabulous! the nina fresa cocktails were nice and fruity and gave me a helluva buzz. ;)\n\ni enjoyed the ambiance of sushi samba so much that i went a second time with my girls during labor day weekend and we were seated in the dining area that later transformed into sugarcane boutique lounge after 11 pm.  our sexy latin waiter, jaiver, was very nice and oh-so-hot too! he was very helpful in explaining to us about the different dishes.  for appetizer, we went with <mark>Tuna Tataki</mark> which was melt in your mouth good! then, for entree, we tried the brazilian churrasco, which was very good too, particularly the dipping sauces that went with the meats.  oh yes, we also ordered the cocktail tree which was awesome! all in all, sushi samba was very nice.  i also love the brazilian/latin infused house music that played while we were dining.  i would definitely go back again!", 
            "more of a 3.5...  although i love trendy, high ceiling restaurants that give you a modern feel..sushi samba's decor is a little too cluttered for me. maybe its because of the fact that its a twist between brazilian, japanese, and peruvian cuisine...where they feel like they need to include all three of the cultures art.. but whatever the case may be, theres just.. too much orange swirls, too many funky paintings, and too many weird faces on their walls. i like more of the simple trends. they play trendy music..which is a plus...but they crank it up as if you're in a club which in turn makes everyone talk louder than usual. it's almost as if you're in a convention. \n\n\nsome of the items that i've tried and have a vivid memory of:\n\n-yellowtail sashimi tiradito. tasted like...yellowtail in salsa. it was good..but it was different. i usually like my sashimis in ponzu sauce.\n\n-mushroom toban-yaki is reallllly good. it comes out in a hot sizzling clay pot with like four of five different kinds of mushrooms. \n\n-<mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> taquito\n\n-robata: \n<mark>Filet Mignon</mark>\n<mark>Lamb Chop</mark>\n<mark>Cherry Tomatoes</mark>\nshiitake mushrooms\n\noysters, uni sashimi. \n\noverall, its not too bad. i like the convenience. the two times i've been here was because i stayed at the palazzo. takes like 5 mins to get here from our room.", 
            "good sushi with a twist. they have some <mark>Uni</mark> flavors and rolls: bobo brazil, yamato (<mark>Foie Gras</mark>, caviar, toro) and a few others. <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> was pretty disappointing.\n\ncareful when ordering the kobe, it's $27 an ounce usually a 5oz minimum. my smart friend ordered 10oz's off the bat thinking it was only $27 total. i am not sure of the name, but the kobe cooked on a hot rock is delicious. worth $150 per order? just for the experience. \n\nif you could gamble $50 a hand on blackjack or pai gow, why not eat it as well?  \n\npros: <mark>Uni</mark> rolls and flavors\n\ncons: very pricey ($2 for wasabi haha), mediocre service both times i went",

            "apryl and i were looking for some sushi. we had made our way to the canal shoppes at the venetian and were browsing the directory for sushi places when we were approached by an employee. we told him what we were looking for and he quickly suggested <mark>Samba Sushi</mark>, adding that \"it's the best sushi on the strip!\"... \n\nafter walking nearly a mile, we found sushi samba. the decor looked interesting and it had a great vibe. \n\nwe each ordered a special roll and split another <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> roll. after waiting 20 minutes, three small, thin, very weird looking rolls arrived to our table. \n\ni will spare you the details of how apryl and i managed to get these things down, but it was not easy. hands down, the worst sushi i've ever had the trouble of putting in my mouth. the idea and creativity of the roll sounds better on the menu than it looks, and far better than it actually tastes. flavorless and lacking any kind of texture. \n\nsave yourself $50... buy a can of tuna and leave it in your hotel room for a day or two... it'll taste the same.", 
            "oh lord, this review is a toughie to write.  sushi samba is a <mark>Uni</mark> restaurant in that it's a blend of japanese, brazilian and peruvian influence, and we had so many different flavors and samplings of things, this will be quite a mixed review.  \n\nthey definitely anticipate people being unable to choose from the wide-range of items on the menu, so they actually give you the option of letting the waitress put together your order based on likes, dislikes, preferences, food allergies, and based on price, etc.  we spouted out... \"salmon!\"   \n\n                \"tuna!\"  \n\n\"spice!\"        \"allergic to shrimp!\"    \n\n                 \"jalapenos!\"  \n\nso, the waitress brought out the following:\n\n(1) edamame with sea salt and lime.\n\nsmall plates:\n(2) berkshire pork gyoza (kabocha pumpkin pure\\u00e9 and su-shoyu dipping sauce) - very good! the pumpkin puree is a nice touch!  just be sure to scrape it all off the plate when you pick up the gyoza!\n(3) <mark>Tuna Tataki</mark> (white asparagus, fresh heart of palm, avocado, tatsoi, citrus soy) - this is seared tuna, marinated a bit in vinegar and ginger - also very good. i have never had tatsoi before - but it is quite good! tastes and looks a bit like spinach but is better!\n\nseviches:\n(4) salmon asparagus, red radish, pineapple, lime - quite good! 2nd fave of the four seviches.\n(5) yellowtail jalape\\u00f1o and lemongrass - our table came to the consensus that this was the winner of the 4 seviches.  perfect amount of spice from the japaleno, and just a bit of tang from the lemongrass - goes very well together with the hamachi! very good!\n(6) tuna granny smith apple, serrano, lime - i did not like this one - the apple taste is awful in my opinion... pass.\n(7) the last one had a very <mark><mark>Osetra Caviar Imperial 20g</mark> 20g</mark> seviche taste - lemon, lime very simple, and good.  the type of fish they used escapes me now.. apologies.\n\nrobata:\n(8) <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> and miso anticucho - <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> pieces marinated with delicious miso on skewers - so good. the fish is very fresh and tender - and the miso is light, but very tasty!  it also comes with <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark> kernels - which if you haven't had it - each kernel is about 5 times the size of a normal corn kernel, and is a bit meatier. yum!\n\nlarge plates:\n(9) toban yaki organic mushroom, charred green onion, garlic chips, kobe beef! they split this in two bowls - which was strange because one bowl was better than the other. not sure how much i liked this dish - the sauce was very heavy/creamy yet bland and lacked something. the other bowl had more tang to the sauce and was better - inconsistency - not good!  mushrooms were yummy though!\n\nsamba rolls:\n(10) el toro (salmon, jalape\\u00f1o, shiso leaf, fresh melted mozzarella, crispy onion): the fave of the bunch yet still not that great seeing as how it doesn't really \"count\" as sushi - melted mozzarella? come on.\n(11) <mark>Neo Tokyo</mark> yellowfin tuna, tempura flake, aji panca - this was a disappointment! the waitress called it the \"ultimate <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark>\" - but it was not spicy whatsoever.  she mentioned that they use a fresher version of tuna - not so when you order <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> elsewhere (where they use the leftover bits of fish and mash it up). meh, pass.\n(12) veggie kun avocado, tomato, arugula, oshinko, yamagobo, wasabi nori flake, tofu miso - pass! tastes fresh but dude - where's the fish!? \n(13) can't remember this last roll because i was so full and couldn't have anymore!!!\n\nthis was so much food - 70 per person. i'd pass on the rolls, and go for samplings of their other small dishes, seviches, skewers! 4 stars.", 
            "we got there around 6:30pm just in time for happy hour and the bar was still pretty packed. we waited a couple of minutes till there were 2 seats available. we really shouldn't have bothered to wait...\nwe asked the bartender for happy hour menus and then we ordered a mojito and a caipirinha. my friend loves mojitos, i don't care for them. he said these were the worse he's ever had. the mojito was slightly better than the caipirinha, but not by much. it practically tasted the same. we also ordered the berry smash and the samba juice which actually looked and tasted quite similar except that the berry smash has no alcohol! none of these drinks were very strong, nor tasted good. for around $12-$15 a drink, it really should've be made by a professional. we went to craftsteak the night before and the drinks there were fantastic. the bartenders @ sushi samba are pretty, but they don't know how to make a decent cocktail. however, it's not all their fault since they were using mostly mixers and not premium alcohol/fresh ingredients unlike other upscale bars/restaurants. \n\nwe also had some apps with our drinks. \napps: <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> roll, yellowtail seviche and crispy yellowtail taquitos. \n\nfor a friday night, their sushi was clearly not very fresh. the <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> was okay, the spicy sauce that was placed on top instead of mixed with the tuna hid whatever flavor the tuna had. i didn't like the yellowtail seviche, but my friend thought it was okay. i thought it was too bitter from the lime. the worse thing out of this whole experience were the yellowtail taquitos. the fish tasted spoiled. my friend was sick all night. it could've been the ridiculous amount of alcohol we consumed that night since we went to dos caminos later that night, but my friend says it was definitely the yellowtail taquitos... the drinks at dos caminos are so much better than sushi samba's... the mojitos are strong and freshly made and the glasses are 2x the size :p",

            "came here on the reccomendation with chef micheal cressoti and i was impressed. it's located at the top floor of the palazzo with a hip and dark ambiance. okay people it's dark crowded and loud. do you forget where you are?!? it's las vegas people!! this is what you should expect. this is the new era where sushi is supposed to be hip. i took my girfriend and a third wheel there for a dinner and pretty much ordered the omakase. as a person who worked around in sushi restaraunts, lived in peru, and surrounded by brazileros, i still was taught i had alot more to learn about the cuisine and the complex flavors on the palate when mixed together. honestly unless you're ordering the kobe beef roll or the fuie gras sushi... skip the whole sushi list. the rolls are great but for the price, i would opt out for the kitchen orders. <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> was a little different but nothing to make you stand up and dance. the red miso <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> (i believe that was the fish) skewers are to die for. the grill is special grill where they use woodchips brought in from japan. this is the kind of special treatment the chefs use to creats such dishes, so the price is reasonable. all their fish is line caught so for the environmentally conscience, expect to pay more for sushi as opposed to other sushi restaraunts. their ceviche was very light and refreshing, so was the yellowtail sashimi and the ceviche. the kobe beef tacos. sorry kogi was okay for me. asian tacos are as good as it gets, but kobe beef tacos who can possibly resist. it was spectacular with the spicy emulsion that was served on the side. the duck confit with wil mushroom is a must order. succulent morsels of variety of mushrooms and the perfectly cooked medium rare breast of duck just melted in your mouth. the sake sommelier was very friendly and knew her alcohol, so if you are interested in ordering sake ask for the pro. from here and there, after 5 other dishes, we ended up with dessert. the chocolate cake, which they said was great, was rather just good, but the carrot cake. i hate carrot cake, but the pastry chef, she whippped up something so magical and delicious. not too sweet, not too heavy, not too bready... if you can understand what i mean, you will love this cake. in a cake, i look for the perfect balance of sweetness and richness, that will just top off your great meal. not to overwhelm your palate and your stomach but make a nice closure to the expensive meal you just enjoyed. it was the best carrot cake i've had. overall the staff was friendly and the general manager was kind enough to explain to me about the food and the kitchen, since i work in the kitchen as well. i left there extremely happy and with an impressed gf and third wheel. thank you sushi samba.",

            "excellent food, but it comes at a price. my boyfriend and i came here for what was supposed to be a light lunch, but we spent over $80 and still left hungry! but it's vegas, and it certainly wasn't the most expensive restaurant we came across. the menu didn't have as many sushi options as we expected- just the basics and a small list of specialty rolls. but there was a good variety of other fusion dishes, which seems to be the restaurant's main focus.\n\nmy boyfriend started off with the sawagani, which is flash fried japanese river crabs. basically, they're small (~1 inch) fried crabs that you eat whole. there was no way i was touching those things! i had the <mark>Tuna Tataki</mark>, which was very fresh and came in a tasty sauce.  we shared the <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark>, which came in larger sized pieces, and the <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> roll. both tasted fine. \n\nfor drinks, my boyfriend tried one of their shochus (not soju), a japanese drink similar to sake but tastes like vodka. prices ranged from $10-15 a glass, and it was pretty potent for a lightweight like me.\n\nservice was great. our server was attentive and had no problem explaining the items on the menu. atmosphere-wise, the interior has a nice, modern decor, but the music is really loud, and the lighting is very dim. overall, we had a good dining experience, and i would recommend trying this place if you have some money to spend!", 
            "chilean <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> skewers with miso - absolutely delicious!  the <mark><mark>Jumbo Shrimp</mark></mark> with passionfruit ceviche -- original and delightful.  my husband's favorite dish was the <mark>Tuna Tataki</mark> .  we came here because i had a taste for sushi and it was the highest ranked by yelpers.  when we arrived, the bar atmosphere caused us to question the yelp reviews but after eating we agree.  the sushi rolls aren't that great (we tried the <mark>Samba Strip</mark> and <mark>El Topo</mark>) but they weren't horrible.  the servers are familiar with the entire menu so if you don't have a specific taste for something, feel free to ask them for their suggestion. they'll have a ton.  also, their drinks are good but lean away from being sweet.  i had to have them muddle more sugar and mint to flavor up my drink a little more because it just tasted like rum with a little mint when they first brought it out.  this is a tapas place so you can easily order 4 plates per person which can get pricey.  but highly recommend for their chilean <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> skewers.  i haven't had <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> this good since g. garvin's restaurant in west los angeles closed a few years ago.  outstanding.", 
            "first impression as you walk in -- who turned out the lights? the restaurant is very dark which seems to be a general theme in vegas. but even for vegas, this was club dark (and loud as well) and hardly appropriate for a restaurant in my opinion.\n\nwe let the server order for us -- we had a large group and trusted the server to make some of the better recommendations, cost no object. the ingredient quality seemed, overall, above average with the exception of what appeared to be farmed salmon. farmed salmon is not preferred even when cooked, let alone as sushi. other fish selections, for<mark>Tuna</mark>, seemed better -- not exceptional, but better than average. but in an absolute sense, the fish quality and selection was definitely not on par with the outrageous pricing that seems so ubiquitous in the palazzo.\n\nbefore i go on, i have to mention that service was impeccable.\n\nthe most disagreeable aspect of this dinner was that, even if high quality fish was being used, you couldn't tell given that it was all served fraken-sushi style. everything was drowning in some sort of sauce and/or combined with other mismatched ingredient so that the finished product is something only frankenstein's monster would find palatable. motainai -- what a waste of fresh fish -- this completely misses the point of sushi / sashimi.\n\nthe good: i didn't order any wine, but they seemed to have a large selection of sake -- from various 'appellations' and a good representation of amakuchi to karakuchi. some well known, some more esoteric. but it seemed like a pretty good list, especially for the us, in a quick scan (again, in the dark).\n\ni would venture back for sake sampling (assuming that they have a good selection by the glass, not just by the bottle). but i wouldn't go back for the franken-sushi. (you may ask why i went in the first place -- i was actually interested in brazilian food for dinner; i misunderstood the theme of the restaurant as there were no brazilian food offerings).", 
            "sushisamba...... where do we start????   ok, lets start with the first thing that was delivered... its my neverfail when i go for sushi....  <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> roll....   even if the tuna isnt the highest of quality somewhere, the <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> roll isnt half bad because of the spicy mayo.....   ok...   sushi samba version is hands down the absolute best <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> roll i have ever had..   woah, time to calm down about it....  the sushi roll literally melted in my mouth, the tuna was uber fresh, the spicy mayo was applied in moderation let his presence be known....   this thing was absolute perfection....  everything else we ordered was great, not to the perfection level of the <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> roll, but it was still great.  wayyyyy better than good.  had some yellowtail roll, oh yeah a $36 kobe beef sashimi roll with some deliciousness baked into it, <mark><mark>Jumbo Shrimp</mark></mark> - straight from the ocean fresh...   some japanese beer, some of this some of that, an hour later and $200 tab we emerged with smiles from ear to ear....   i had always heard good things about the place, but until i experienced it for myself, could never truly know how great it actually is.  i will be going back shortly, even if its only to order the <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> roll...   i would trust that everything they have there would be to the quality in which i encountered in my meal.... fear not yelpers... this place will treat you right....", 
            "sushi samba is pretty tucked away in the palazzo, the atmosphere is ok, service and bartenders were friendly and nice at the bar, and the food is pretty decent too.  it's also great that they have a happy hour menu from 4-7 sun-fri, but... my only gripe is that it's not really a happy hour menu if you discount items and then serve them 1/2 size, which is what i expect was happening since our portions were teeny tiny, the drinks were served in small glasses and then i saw the normal pint-size glasses that the same drinks were being made in to take to the tables. the mojitos were bomb though. \n\nthat said... the food was actually pretty good. we had the <mark>Salt and Pepper Squid</mark> (yummy!), <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> roll (small, and could've been spicier, but still good), chicken skewers, some others, and i also tried the japan relief roll (all the money goes to japan relief ppl, order it!) which was also really tasty - combo of <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark>, eel, wrapped in a soy paper wrap. \n\nit wasn't a bad way to spend $80 (esp in vegas) but again, if you're going to advertise specials for happy hour, they should actually be specials, not just 1/2 the plate for 1/2 the price. nothing special 'bout that.", 
            "this place continues to impress!  this time while i was there i ran into a fellow elite member which was both shocking and awesome!   i got the <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> roll again and my friend ordered the <mark>Neo Tokyo</mark> roll....  based on my previous review you know that i am a huge fan of the <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> roll, and now you will know how much i loved the <mark>Neo Tokyo</mark> roll... this has yellowfin tuna, tempura flake and aji panca and it is just purely fantastic.  there was so much going on with this roll that it hit you in layers.  with each one, i found something else that i liked even more about it.  if you are going here, these two rolls should be your top two.", 
            "maybe it's because i've enjoyed many a meal at the sushi samba locations in nyc, and maybe because i was a little hungover from the previous nights festivities, but i was not overly wowed by lunch here with two of my lady loves with whom i was vacationing. \n\none thing that is always a priority on vacation is food. it has to be, this is a break from the mundane life i leave behind, so why do i want to eat my standard weekly fare of life in the working world? i love sushi and because of it's nutritious nature figured this would be a great way to replenish all things lost to bottomless cocktails and greasy late night foods. i didn't partake in the consumption of any libations at lunch, but did hear that the mojito was pretty stellar.\n\ni ordered the trio <mark>Seaweed Salad</mark> that came beautifully presented on a three trayed dish of hijiki, wakame, and my favorite aka-tosaka. each were lightly dressed with lemon and sidelined with some tomato caviar. not terrible for a $11, but not overly substantial either. for lunch i ordered <mark>Yellowtail Jalapeno</mark> which was ok if not a little heavy on the jalapeno, and a <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> that was all sorts of bland. i think i would have been happier enjoying these as a happy hour because it seems that the prices are a little easier to swallow for the quality of the food. i didn't order anything complex, and maybe they just let the \"easy\" stuff slide, but i wasn't terribly enthused enough to want to go back and give it a second shot to see just how good the rest of the menu is according to the higher ratings given.", 
            "i came back to sushi samba over memorial day weekend and loved it so much that i actually ate there twice. the service and staff are incredible. everyone is really nice, especially the ladies at the bar. the happy hour menu is such a great deal too, $6 for everything (i think there's at least 8 different items to choose from, including 2 different drinks. i recommend the mojito). i loved the <mark>Salt and Pepper Squid</mark> (a better version of fried calamari), <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> roll, and the yellowtail seviche (it had a really nice ginger flavor to it). the kobe beef tacos were also amazing. as i mentioned in my previous review, the portions are not the biggest, but when you factor in that this is vegas, you are actually getting pretty good bang for your buck. \n\nthey should use maybe brighter lights inside though, it's kind of tucked away and easy to miss, in my opinion. people need to see this place!! :) \n\ngreat prices, great service. i will definitely be back! thanks sushi samba!", 
            "i don't believe it is possible to give a better rating.  we went to vegas for my wife's birthday.  the was our last night, and we wanted to go out for the last time.  we had already eating diner a couple of hours before hand.  so we figured we would go for a late night snack.  we went to sushi samba, and could not have made a better decision.\n\nwe were pretty indecisive about what to order.  so our waitress suggested that we answer a few of her questions, and she would suggest a meal for us.  that was perfect.  we had the yellow tail tacos which was delicious.  very light, and refreshing.  then we had the <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> skewers.  amazing sauce, and was great.  then we ended up with the <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark>.  great meal.  great suggestions.\n\nbut the topper was the owner liz.  she came over to our table.  she was very welcoming, and actually talked to us.  i didn't feel as if she was doing it, as part of some shtick.  she was very genuine.  which was cool. \n\nwe ended the night with a vanilla chocolate cake for my wife's birthday.  overall great experience.  when we go back to vegas.  this will definitively be one of our stops.", 
            "my friends and i came here for happy hour.  \n\nthere wasn't much room at the bar, but i found a single table in the bar.  i asked the hostess if we could sit there and she said yes but we had to order from the bar. i asked the hostess for menus and after she told me i had to order from the bar she said someone would be there to help me. errr...ok? my friend didn't hear any of this, but the bartender was nice and said instead of having us go up to the bar, she would have a waiter serve us.  the waiter who came was also really nice.\n\ni ordered a veggie tempura and <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> roll. the veggie tempura roll was one of the bigger dishes there and was pretty good. it came with a <mark><mark>Osetra Caviar Imperial 20g</mark> 20g</mark> and a creamy tangy sauce.  the <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> roll had really weird rice.  it was smashed together and wasn't sushi rice.  i'm not sure that it was even <mark>Steamed Japanese Rice</mark>.  i know this is a fusion restaurant but please don't f up sushi rice! \n\n3 stars might seem a little harsh for bad rice, but as a whole, i guess i just wasn't that impressed.  it wasn't bad, but it was def. a'ight.",

            "my wife and i really liked sushi samba and their fushion menu.  we were running late for a show and couldn't wait to be seated in the main restaurant so we sat at the bar at the edge of the restaurant and the mall area as soon as something opened up.  lara s was our main waitress plus another girl and she was very friendly and helpful in selecting our drinks and menu items.  my wife and i are big st. germaine liquor fans and we loved the \"chu-cumber\" drink.  also thought the tempura green bean appetizer with truffle aioli sauce was yummie.  we had a sampling of sushi and pacific, <mark>El Topo</mark>, and <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> rolls and all was very good.",

            "this restaurant caught my eye because it was something out of the ordinary from your typical sushi restaurant. the menu offered an intriguing variety but when i began reading the reviews i knew i had to try it. i would suggest anyone going there for the first time to try the dining experience because you may think you know what you want but the chef knows better! the server asks if there is anything you do not like or if you have any food allergies and then how much money per person you're looking to spend. there are options anywhere from $50 per person to $130 per person if kobe beef if something that interests you. as it was for a special occasion we opted for $80 per person and even though thats more than i have probably ever spent on a single meal there were no regrets.\n\ncourse #1 consisted of berkshire pork gyoza which is basically pork dumplings in a pumpkin puree and yellowtail ceviche taquitos, both of which were absolutely delicious and not necessarily something i would have ordered on my own.\n\ncourse #2 was yellowtail sashimi in a spicy peruvian sauce with a slice of red jalapeno on top and octopus sashimi in a japanese citrus sauce which again were both to die for!\n\ncourse #3 had an array of <mark>Filet Mignon</mark>, <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>, <mark>Alaskan King Crab</mark> and <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark>. all were moist and tender but the <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> absolutely melted in your mouth! <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark> was a yummy alternative to <mark><mark>Osetra Caviar Imperial 20g</mark> 20g</mark> as well.\n\nfinally, course #4 was the main sushi dinner. <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark> rolls were delicious, but the <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> with i believe tuna on top was absolutely amazing! there was also <mark>Half Maine Lobster</mark> and another roll which i believe had lobster in it as well and was probably the only thing of the entire dinner that i was not absolutely amazed with, but it was still good!\n\nanother great thing about this place is they tell you if there is anything throughout this meal you do not like they will take it back and bring you something else! as our server said, \"its like a money back guarantee!\"\n\nanyways this is definitely a place i would tell everyone who loves trying new things to try or even just the sushi lover. do it! it will not disappoint!\n\nonly part i would complain about is the fact that there is not one in california!!!",

            "i came here on a saturday night for dinner to celebrate my 25th birthday with the best of company, fun entertainment, and delicious food!!! i'd been here before but always sat in the front of the restaurant... had no clue how huge this place was!!! we sat in the very back (where it seems many of the large birthday parties were seated) the ambiance of the restaurant is very dark and jungle esque (if i remember correctly o.o) lol very ruckusy and vegas appropriate! there were drummers and scandalous (but h0t) dancers going up and down the aisles which provided for the fun entertainment.  but enough of that, on to the main event. \n\nwe had a party of 6 and decided it best to do as our super nice server suggested, omakase style :) \n- cucumber cocktail on the house!!! they brought each of us a mini cocktail to start the meal off! very nice and considerate of them! nice and refreshing and definitely got my appetite going :) \n- a trio appetizer platter consisting of well salted edamame, roasted shito peppers, and deep fried string beans served in the most delicious chipotle aoli sauce (all 3 were delicious but i think my favorite would have to be the roasted shito peppers with a drizzle of lime juice for a nice kick)\n- yellowtail sashimi mini tacos!!! these were sooo fun and delicious! great fushion idea! the restaurant is very accommodating, we mentioned to them 1 of the girls is allergic to cilantro so they brought out a special lobster taco for just for her! the flavors were bold and the taco shell was nice and crispy.  but i think i still enjoy dos camino's mini tacos better...those are to.die.for.  \n- ahi tuna over a piece of bamboo and basil leaf.  this was an interesting combination.  probably my least favorite dish of the night.  the basil leaf was a bit overwhelming and covered the taste of the ahi too much. \n- <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> with oversized asparagus.  the meat was tender and very well cooked, very pink in the middle.  i'm not a big beef eater so i only ate the edges of the piece but my friends seemed to enjoy it.  definitely not one of the top dishes of the night but was still yummy.  the asparagus however, was quite delicious!! they probably cooked it in butter... hahaha i'll take it :) a good bite on the outside and nice and tender on the inside! \n- <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> with oversized <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark>!!! yummmy!!!! the <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> was nice and flaky.  flavoring was a bit salty but i feel like at these restaurants they tend to do that a bit...i mean, everyones a bit intoxicated so salty foods are what people want lol the <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark> was just really fun to eat!! my friends really enjoyed it but i definitely like summer sweet white corn on the cob better :) \n- mushroom pot on crack. this was definitely the show stopper of the night!!! the flavoring of the sauce, the textures of the 3? 4? different mushrooms. happiness. the sauce was like a cream of mushroom, milky, full flavored, salty, a hint of sweetness... too good. needless to say we all took a bite and just smiled in satisfaction. we all stared at each other and knew rice was needed to soak up all that bomb sauce!! \n- 4 different sushi rolls were brought out last (3.5 stars).  all 4 were decent, nothing really to rave much about unfor<mark>Tuna</mark>. :(  i'm a big big sushi lover and have had some off the chart rolls so i can't pretend these were anything to die for.  \n\n***the first time i came my friend ordered for the table and i definitely think that made a difference.  they have some really scrumptious dishes that i wish i could've ordered for my friends to try!! perhaps next time!! i'll be more prepared lol \n\noverall ratings:\nfood - 3.75 stars (except for the mushroom pot on crack... 4.5 stars for that)\nfood (for the first time i came) - 4.25 stars! \ndrink - 4 stars for the cucumber cocktail & bottle of santa margaritta pino grigio\npresentation - 4 stars\nservice & ambiance - 4 stars\n\ni gave this place 4 stars mainly because i had a great time that night, and the company i kept definitely played a big part in that.  the food is goood, just a bit $$$$.  its definitely a great place to go with a group thats just looking for some good eats, good drinks, and a great time :o) bottom line: i'd definitely go back again!!", 
            "the dinner was fantastic. i had a hard time choosing so i had the waitress choose. she picked the <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> sushi.  pork gioza, <mark>Salt and Pepper Squid</mark>, <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>. everything was great until we decided not to have dessert. the waitress's attitude completely changed.", 
            "their signature roll saved them from a 2 star review.  reading the reviews and consistency of solid reviews, i thought i found the spot!  once there, the overpriced menu and sake list reminded me i was in vegas, a place that should not have to be this expensive, i mean come on, people are handing money hand over fist at the tables, don't gouge us at the restaurants.  nigiri was priced per piece at a rate higher than i'm used to paying for 2 pieces.  the rolls were decent, i liked the <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> version they served, a little <mark>Uni</mark>, the eel avocado was good.  my main complaint is that they are a decent sushi spot, nothing extraordinary, and their prices are simply too high.  however, the samba roll, with <mark>Half Maine Lobster</mark>, mango and some other delightful flavors that created a party on my palate, bumped them to 3 stars.  great roll, $19, but that one was special.", 
            "i almost want to give this a 5. near oh my god moment, but not quite.\n\nthis is a little misleading. i swear this came up under \"chinese\" on yelp while we were looking for something (in a group <mark><mark>Assortment of Four</mark></mark>) but this is definitely not chinese. it's japanese brazilian fusion, which i had never had, but was awesome. the menu is a bid daunting, but the waitress offered to bring out a tasting menu for us, based on the common questions like, \"are you ok with raw fish,\" \"do you have allergies,\" \"how do you eat red meat,\" etc. this was helpful - usually i'm not fazed by the large menu, but for some reason i was having problems focusing. worth mentioning they say up front that they'll take back anything we don't like, no charge, and they do ask for a budget to keep them in line.\n\nwhat we got was really pretty exceptional. gyoza steamed and pan fried, hamachi taquitos (not what you're thinking - not the deep fried rolls, but little taco shells filled with hamachi sashimi), seared tuna with baby greens and crunchy salt, and portabella fries with kabocha aioli. all sounds fancy, all really good.\n\nthen a warm plate - grilled <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> with a sweet glaze, <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> (not their a5 w<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark>, which we were offered for an upcharge, but declined) and <mark><mark>Alaskan King Crab</mark> Leg</mark>, all with a side of elote. the bass was good - tender and flaky, and i like the glaze. but it was crazy overpowered by the beef and crab. firstly, the beef was far superior to what we had at n9ne. tender, flavorful, and with a great salt and pepper crust on the outside, served with a little pile of powdered chile for dipping. and the crab was that near oh my god moment. an *enormous* <mark><mark>Alaskan King Crab</mark> Leg</mark>, brushed with a sort of thick butter sauce, served piping hot. wow, this was exceptional. and while i guess i should expect it, points to the restaurant for realizing that serving a filet and a <mark><mark>Alaskan King Crab</mark> Leg</mark> family style to diners that have only chopsticks required that you slice things up in to nice little bite sized pieces.\n\nfinally, sushi. their <mark>Neo Tokyo</mark> roll, which is their version of the <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark>, a hamachi roll with spicy crab and avocado on top, a tuna roll with asparagus, dusted with wasabi, and an assortment of sashimi and nigiri. as well as a hot roll - something covered in melted mozzarella, crispy onions and a sweet sauce. all of the cold rolls were good - i especially liked their <mark>Neo Tokyo</mark> roll. the sashimi was also very good, but the hot roll...i could do without. it was in interesting twist - not just the cheese was hot, but the entire roll, rice and all. however, the cheese and a heaping helping of onion and sauce overpowered whatever might have been inside. this was about the only misstep i could find.\n\nthe atmosphere is odd - lots of pounding techno music, along with an odd video collage (on many many video screens) of brazilian beach babes, bullet trains, brazilian slums, and japanese salarymen trudging to their soul-murdering jobs. not sure what they were going for. but whatever.\n\ngreat spot - chinese though it wasn't, we all were appropriately full when it was over (not hungry, no stuffed) and we all agreed we'd be back. the total bill, excluding drinks, was probably about $65 per person. i loved the mix of appetizers, hot beef and seafood, and sushi. if you're going with a group, this is a fun way to try stuff without having to worry about reading a menu.", 
            "the sushi was good, not great, just good.  unfor<mark>Tuna</mark>, i've paid a lot less for much better.  3 stars because this restaurant is clever with menu items and decor, but nestled in the heart of a massive casino full of tourists and prices to boot. this place kind of reminds me of a jefferson airplane video, dark, yet colorful.  the wait staff were very friendly, but inattentive for an early dinner service.", 
            "i wanted to do happy hour before a night of binge drinking so i decided to make reservations at sushi samba for me and my 5 girlfriends. on the reservations site i was told that happy hour was served throughout the restaurant which sounded perfect because we had a big party and we all know how crowded the bar area can get. however, once we arrived, we were told it was at the bar area only. whomp. the bar area is super small but we managed to snag a little table and squeeze all of our bodies around it. not the most comfortable seating, but it'll have to do.\n\nwe ordered everything on their happy hour menu. all the dishes were about $5 and we wanted to try everything. unfor<mark>Tuna</mark> our waitress came back 3 times just to tell us that they \"no longer had this item on their happy hour menu\". bogus! i asked why and she told me that their menu is ever changing and since we came on the last day of the month, \"they ran out of ingredients\". really?!  so instead of eating, we decided to just drink and ate whatever few things they did have on happy hour. we ordered some rolls off their regular menu and they were all lacking. a $16 roll with only 4 pieces? kind of ridiculous, wouldn't you agree? and it wasn't even all that. we left hungry and disappointed. luckily we were buzzed so we got over it rather quickly.",

            "my mother and i are came here last sunday for happy hour.  the sushi was absolutely delicious- fresh with decent portion sizes.  we particularly liked that they don't use a lot of rice  in lieu of other ingredients like many sushi restaurants. we tried several dishes from the happy hour menu at $6 each:\n\n<mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> roll - good not not too different from other <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> rolls we tried\n<mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark> roll - good portions of <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark> and not too greasy\nsalmon sushi - great flavor with asparagus.  this was my mother's favorite.\njapanese style <mark>Salt and Pepper Squid</mark> - a bit salty but quite tasty.  small portion.\nyellowtail seviche- two thinly sliced yellowtail with a tasty spicy sauce.  this was my favorite.\n\nin addition, we ordered the california roll which was $14.  however,  they used real crab instead of imitation crab.  it was quite tasty with generous amounts of crab used.  \n\nthe service was good.  the restaurant itself is dark with several televisions positioned around- they don't show sports just a program about sushi.  it would be even better if they had a television at the bar for sports.",

            "planned a 12-person dinner celebration here for a bachelorette party over labor day weekend and couldn't have been happier with the choice! \n\nsushi samba was great from the get-go. we emailed them to see about their pre-fix ordering menu for bigger parties, and their events coordinator got back to us immediately with all the important details.\n\nthe night of our reservation, my friend and i arrived at the restaurant early with some requests for our dinner. the hostess brought out the manager and our waiter to speak with us directly. both accommodated us perfectly in our requests for pre-ordering drinks, finding an ideal price-point for our group, and making sure the menu suited our needs. \n\nwe were seated in their backroom at a great big table. our waiter was extremely friendly without being overbearing. we ordered the family-style meal and asked for options on the lighter/fresher/fishier side of things. all items we got were awesome-- they hit the nail on the head with our requests: \n\n<mark>Green Bean Tempura</mark>, <mark>Tuna Tataki</mark>, ceviche tacos, terriyaki fish skewers, a wide variety of sushi, edamame... and even more! they also made special plates for one of the girls who didn't eat raw fish. bonus points right there!\n\nat our price point (about $40/per person before tax and tip) we had plenty of food and even extra left over. splitting everything family style made for a really fun evening and made splitting the check extremely easy. \n\ni would definitely recommend this place to anyone planning a party. now i just have to check out sushi samba in chicago!", 
            "oh my goodness. i would have to say the dinner i had here was one of the best treats i've had this year! i am so for<mark>Tuna</mark> to have gotten this experience that i will never forget. it was so awesome! if coming here, i'd suggest making reservations because it is jam packed, but only because it is that good. the environment is bustling and vibrant. so. much. fun! \n\nwhen my friends showed up we got seated right away were introduced to the chef who told us he had many special dishes on their way. first off they presented us with a tower of drinks! all mini glasses of their specialty cocktails. so awesome! there were four of us and they brought us a total of 3 towers, so we each got to try 6 different flavors. loved it so much. the variety was just amazing. i'd have to say my top 3 favorites were the chu-cumber (cucumber flavored one), the lemon samurai, and pisco sour (i have visited peru before so i've had the opport<mark>Uni</mark> to try an authentic version of this before). so so great!\n\nall the meals brought out for us to share were fantastic! the <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark> was different a cool blend of flavors to add to our palette. the <mark><mark>Alaskan King Crab</mark> Leg</mark> were perfection! and my other favorite dishes were the mini tacos and the shelled <mark>Scallop</mark>. so amazing! other fantastic dishes i got to try were the <mark>Salt and Pepper Squid</mark>, <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark> (amazing), miso marinated <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>, <mark>Chicken Teriyaki-Samba Style</mark>... like i said. one. amazing. experience!!! i can't wait to come back again.", 
            "the food was amazing, as was the service. my mom and i went and basically just relied on recommendations from our server, homer. he recommended the most delicious cocktails and dishes. he even surprised us with one dish simply based on the preferences we mentioned and it was incredible. it was <mark>Scallop</mark> with a sweet/teriyaki-like glaze and <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark> on the side. highly recommend. \n\nwe also had the cucumber cocktail, lychee bubbletail, and lychee martini. all amazing. we ordered the special roll for the night which was phenomenal. additionally, we got the taquitos (more like tacos with a hard shell) with the yellowtail, absolutely delicious. i doubt you can go wrong here. \n\nunfor<mark>Tuna</mark> for all of you, that was homer's last night. huge loss to sushisamba, i must say.", 
            "since this was downstairs in our hotel, the palazzo, and it was happy hour, we decided to stop by. it's only in the bar area though so we had to wait a little bit for a seat or open area at the bar. special fancy drinks for $6 and then also an assortment of appetizers for also $6 each. each portion is tiny so  getting food for multiple people so it can add up. we tried the yellowtail (2 pieces in an order), <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> roll, <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark> roll, <mark>Salt and Pepper Squid</mark>, and the enzo roll (i think that's what it called). the yellowtail was fresh and had a <mark>Uni</mark> sauce (lemongrass) that it came with. the first two rolls and the squid were ok. and the enzo roll was my favorite. it had salmon and these crispy bits in it and was rolled in like a white rice paper instead of seaweed. for drinks we all tried the fresca, which had muddled strawberries and a bunch of alcohols. i found it light, sweet and refreshing. all and all, a good place for a little something something before dinner. hh is definitely not enough for a full on meal and it's a little pricey but i guess better than a regular meal here.", 
            "love sushi. love pan-asian so i had high expectations. absolutely amazing <mark>Tuna Tataki</mark> recommended by bartender.  see my pic. i would return here just to eat it again!salmon sashimi was fresh but nothing memorable. even at the bar the service was awful, quite prompt probably due to being there 3 pm but they got orders wrong on both sides of me, and not terribly attentive. yes they're expensive but no more so than any similar quality restaurant. if you want good, cheap authentic asian food you need to go off-strip to where the locals live.", 
            "my favorite destination on my annual trip to las vegas. mari, the bartender, is awesome. so friendly and ready to suggest great stuff. i have fairly standard stuff -- <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark>, spicy salmon  gyoza. always tasty. nice selection of sake. i like to sit at the bar. a great \"comfort food\" place, if you love sushi. yum!", 
            "the food was very impressive.  the experience was what ruined the entire evening.  the noise level was quite loud, but nothing that i haven't experienced before.  we made a reservation and were really looking forward to some great sushi.  we ordered edamame to start with, the <mark>Samba Sushi</mark> chef's selection and a dragon roll.  the waitress recommended we get more, even though we had already run through the menu with her and settled on what we would be ordering.  the edamame arrived, and seriously 30 seconds later all the sushi made its way to the table.  we maybe spent 30 total minutes at the restaurant.  it was a overall a really unfor<mark>Tuna</mark> experience, and had it not been for the food, it would have been truly awful.", 
            "open late! the sushi here was awesome! the service was ok... i wanted to give this place a 5 star but the waitress insisted on letting us know about the drama in the restaurant repeatedly. we had a <mark>Soft Shell Crab Roll</mark> that was to die for.. fresh crab in the roll along with a <mark>Alaskan King Crab</mark> claw with the fresh claw meat still in it. we ordered a roll that was to have no rice and as a substitute for the seaweed they use cucumber that is sliced thin to wrap around the sashimi inside. unfor<mark>Tuna</mark> after waiting for about 20 min for this roll the waitress came to tell us they made a mistake in the back and no longer have the cucumber. in order to make up for it they gave us a roll they made in error on the house. all in all i would come back, but might avoid the waitress as i feel she aired to much of the internal problems to us.", 
            "food is good. prices are not.\n\n- <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>: $29 miso glazed and pretty freakin delicious. cooked perfectly also. but the portion was probably 3 maybe 4 bites at most.\n\n- handrolls: we had salmon skin, salmon and avocado, <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark>, and yellowtail. the ingredients were fresh, but the rolls were very small and about ~$8-$10/each.\n\n- various rolls: we tried the yamato ($19 for 3 pieces). there wasn't even enough for me to get a chance to try it since there were only 3 pieces lol, but my friends said it was probably the best roll there. pure decadence being topped with <mark>Foie Gras</mark>, caviar, and gold flakes. we also tried a few other rolls for which i can't remember the names (sorry!) but they had <mark>Seared W<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> Beef</mark> and another had <mark>Half Maine Lobster</mark>. both were interesting, but i wasn't blown away.\n\n- nigiri: fresh but again, extremely pricey! $5-$10 a piece! yup, not an order of 2 pieces...that price is per piece! o_o\n\n- sides: we ordered the corn and plantains at $7 each. the corn was delicious but a very small portion in a cup. same thing with plantains. grilled deliciously but only a few slices for a whopping $7.\n\nif you haven't gotten the undertone of my review yet, it's that this place is expensive! lol we each paid roughly $50/person and no one left feeling full. it wouldn't have been so bad had the service been better though. we were missing a few things at the table and had to ask several times for it (place setting, water, and soy sauce dishes).", 
            "my boyfriend took me and another couple here for this past valentines day. \n\nit was super empty at 8:30 pm on valentines night which i thought was really weird. \n\ni'll start off by saying service was impeccable. even the manager came over to check on us and wish us a happy valentines day and even chatted it up with us for a little while. he even brought some kind of champagne with strawberries for us at the end of our dinner. i believe his name was jeremy so if i'm correct....then thanks jeremy you definitely made our experience a good one. kudos to philip our waiter as well. he dealt with our drunk asses throughout the entire dinner and provided amazing service at the same time. \n\nwe ordered an order of the <mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> to try. yeh we ended up ordering another 4 orders right away. i think that might give you a good idea of just how amazing this dish is. i can guarantee you won't be disappointed with it. then we got the churrasco with like 3 or 4 different meats that came with 3 different sauces. if you've got money to spend then i definitely suggest getting this dish. the <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> hand roll with spicy mayo on top was also amazing. hands down the best <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> hand roll i've ever had. \n\nthe two downsides to this place and the reason i took off one star is because of how pricy this place is for the amount of food they give you and the fact that their bathroom had absolutely no lights. i literally couldn't see where i was or what i was doing the entire time i was in the stall. \n\noverall if i have a lot or extra cash to spend then i will most definitely be back for the great service and especially another helping of the <mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> and <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> hand roll.", 
            "fantastic food and great service. had reservations on a sunday night and all the staff members was very attentive to our table. every dish we had was mouth watering. the <mark>Tuna Tataki</mark> was so delicious. the <mark>Sao Paulo</mark> roll is unlike any sushi i've tried - the blend of flavors and texture is so tasty. even the drinks we had were very good. i'm looking forward to going back next time i'm in town.", 
            "not impressed!  went here for happy hour and it was empty (usually a bad sign)!  our waitress/bartender was snooty and not very helpful.  i hate that because for us part of the experience of sitting at the bar is chatting with the bartender, but unfor<mark>Tuna</mark> that didn't happen here.  the happy hour appetizers were tiny and we calculated that each small bite we took cost about $3 which is probably normal for vegas, but we had found other wonderful happy hours that were a much better deal and a lot more fun.  i really wanted to like this place because the menu looked interesting and it had great reviews, but will not be returning.", 
            "my girlfriend and i stayed at the venetian and came here after watching cirque du soliel: zarkana at aria on 05-11-14. i found this restaurant on yelp before we came. i absolutely love sushi and she hates it. we both love texas de brazil so i figured a good compromise would be a churrascaria crossed with a sushi bar so we picked sushi samba. i always like to find the most expensive roll at sushi bars and try it so i picked the s\\u00c3o paulo for $24. it had <mark>Scallop</mark>, masago, red onion, tuna, salmon, shrimp, yellowtail, avocado, truffle, hacho miso soy, chive oil inside. to be honest the red onion over powered the flavor of every other ingredient and kind of ruined it for me. this is coming from someone that loves onions too. if i come back i'll probably ask them to cut that out when i order. i also ordered a generic <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> roll. for our two sharable sides we ordered <mark>Purple Potato Mash</mark> and <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark>. the two sides were the best thing at this restaurant. the <mark>Purple Potato Mash</mark> had a rich buttery taste and creamy texture that melted in my mouth. the <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark> had a perfect amount of sweetness and the texture was lightly firm just the way i like. the real downside of the meal though is that my girlfriend decided to order the <mark>Berkshire Pork Belly</mark> rather than the <mark>Lamb Chop</mark> she was thinking about. i asked if she was sure she wanted that and she said yes. i neglected to mention to her that <mark>Berkshire Pork Belly</mark> is literally a seared section of fat. she was not pleased, but didn't want to order anything else when her food arrived. my girlfriend was actually quite content with the <mark>Purple Potato Mash</mark> and <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark>. overall the experience was pretty good except for the group of 3 drunk russian speaking call girls (assuming) seated next to us that were intent on yelling over the music the entire time they were there instead of leaning in to hear one another. but, hey if you aren't hearing a drunk person screaming in another language next to you at most of the places you're at then you aren't experiencing vegas the right way. ha!", 
            "i am so glad we had the chance to dine at sushisamba our last night in vegas! our waiter michael was fantastic and made the entire experience that much more memorable. we literally loved everything we ordered. be sure to make a reservation because it gets very busy, and if you're celebrating anything let the hostess know. we were celebrating our wedding anniversary and they gave us a free small dessert.\n\nsmall plates:\n<mark>Seared W<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> Beef</mark> goyza - do not miss this! it was incredible - every table around us had also ordered it and we were in unanimous agreement.\n\nyellowtail crispy taquitos - light & delicious with an asian dressing on the greens.\n\nrobata:\nribeye - it's described as spicy but it's not, just has subtle spic flavoring and was very tender.\n\n<mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> - phenomenal. there's a reason it's the most popular thing on the menu. melts in your mouth with an amazing miso glaze.\n\nsamba rolls:\n<mark>Neo Tokyo</mark>: similar to a <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> roll flavor but with tuna both inside and on top of the roll. fresh and great flavor.\n\ndessert: \nfried doughnuts with cream dipping sauce - oh my goodness, sooo good. not a light dessert (fried dough) but ah-ma-zing.\n\nsince we were celebrating our wedding anniversary, they gave us a free small dessert of green tea ice cream pops dipped in chocolate with pop candy crust, which was cool and refreshing.\n\nwe will definitely be back on our next trip!",

            "i'm giving 5 stars because the sushi was fantastic, and the dishes were creative and inspired. love the brazilian fusion. tried two kinds of sashimi ceviche, both delicious. <mark>Scallop</mark> were amazing. had some salmon and yellowtail sashimi that was fresh and perfect. and, a special take on a <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> roll that was unbelievable. the service was fine. not thrilling, but perfectly serviceable.", 
            "this is a review of their happy hour (4-7pm and 11pm until close).\n\nthe skinny: spent $50+ on sub par peruvian influenced japanese food (2.5), service: was slow when we wanted to leave (3) value: seeing as there was only 1 dish out of 8 that we would get again, we won't likely be back (3).\n\nwe were excited to see that they had a happy hour menu while meandering through the venetian properties. we thought great! if the food is good during happy hour, we'll come back another time and try their other regularly priced dishes. \n\nso we ordered 8 out of 10 ($6)items on their happy hour menu. of the 8, we'd probably get only 1 item again. the rest was pretty mediocre considering how much they charge for each dish and the level of cuisine.\n\nwe should have known. i mean when the first dish - yellowtail tiradito - came out, i knew it wasn't going to be good. the thinly sliced 2 pieces of yellowtail were drowning in a pepper sauce. i really couldn't taste the flavor of the fish at all. definitely not well balanced. \n\n<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> (3 pieces) with kabocha puree was okay. although the beef had a wonderful smokiness to it, the gyoza were disappointingly undersalted even after dunking in a good amount of soy sauce. the kabocha squash was relatively flavorless which surprised me after reading reviews about this dish.\n\nchicken anticuchos (2 skewers)were not bad although they weren't particularly memorable either. the meat, slightly grilled/charred, was not crispy enough texturally although it was adequately seasoned.\n\neggplant anticuchos with a side of <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark> was okay. i dug the slightly herbaceous kick of the chiffonated mint or basil, cutting the sweetness of the soy based sauce. however the eggplant was a tinge on the tougher side and needed to be roasted with more oil to give it a better texture.  the <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark> is definitely not one of my favorite foods. potato-like in taste and texture, the chef was able to infuse some acidity to make it more flavorful. it was more palatable with the hit of citrus but still, nothing i needed to try again.\n\nthe sushi (veggie kun - kind of like futomaki, ezo roll - meager amounts of salmon/asparagus with a ton of panko breadcrumbs mixed in = bad mouth feel, and <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> - acceptable but nothing exciting) was the most lackluster portion of our meal. considering rice composes about 50% of sushi, it was highly disappointing to find it overly mushy and over seasoned. it kind of ruined it for me. factor in the high rice to filling ratio, i cannot recommend any sushi dish made here. this is rather unfor<mark>Tuna</mark> because sushi comprises at least a significant portion of the menu.\n\nthe only highlight of the meal was the <mark>Salt and Pepper Squid</mark>. melt-in-your-mouth tender pieces of squid with a delicate batter, this was the one dish that the hubs and i truly enjoyed.\n\nfood service was surprisingly and perhaps questionably prompt. there was a small gap in service with our last dish but it wasn't too bad. it was unfor<mark>Tuna</mark> that the bar service was slower than expected and easily overwhelmed. after our meal, we just wanted to get the check processed and go. however, a loud obnoxious group of women (aka the skanky looking anti-milfs who obviously collected club wristbands) completely commandeered her attention with to go orders. the two other bartenders were milling around but did not help her. so the hubs had to endure some random, potentially contagious woman's behind rubbing against his left leg while she took orders from other groups of people. he was highly grumpy after being mauled and ignored.\n\nin reality, this joint rates about a 2.5 however i rounded up to a three based on the fact that there was 1 dish which was truly outstanding. however, given our experience, we are not likely to return. 3 starred review.", 
            "my dining experience fell short of my expectations considering what we ate (or shall i say what we didn't eat) compared to what we paid. there were 21 of us for dinner and we had the chef's selection, also known as omakase. typically, you would get the most innovative dishes ordering this style.  however, we were served typical menu items.  i think it was just a strategic way for them to serve a larger group without having to cater to individual orders. \n\nthe good was that most of the items we tasted were pretty good. the bad was that we weren't given enough food to taste everything, even though we were all charged the same price.  \n\ninstead, we shared each plate of food between 5-7 people, which included the following: \n(1) <mark>Tuna Tataki</mark>: only got to try it because someone didn't eat raw fish. \n(2) <mark>Seared W<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> Beef</mark> dumplings: not enough brought out so i never got to try it. \n(3) mini yellow tail tacos:  i liked the spicy foam which added a nice kick to the citrus-ey flavors of the dish. \n(4) crab tempura: how ridiculous is it that there were only several pieces to each order so the hubs and i had to share one bite of one piece? this wouldn't even qualify as an amuse-bouche. \n(5) <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> and shrimp skewers: again, not enough so most of us shared skewers. \n(6) steak and mushroom stew: everyone got 1-2 thin slices of beef, which was tender and flavorful. \n(7) sushi rolls/sashimi: the sushi rolls were the most generous items served (about 5 cut rolls) but imo were rather underwhelming. the sashimi, on the other hand, was delicious and fresh. we were given about 3 slices each of yellowtail, tuna, and salmon which i easily could have eaten by myself.\n\ni felt bad for the hubs because he was still hungry and asked what was being served next, only to be told that it was just dessert followed by a $2500 bill ($240 per couple). \n\nyes, our server was pleasant and friendly. yes, the food was quite tasty.  and, yes, they need to recalculate the amount of food for groups ordering from the chef's selection. sure, i expected to pay a lot for this kind of meal, but what i didn't expect was to leave unsatisfied and wanting for more.", 
            "yum!! i always leave ss looking forward to my next visit. the table always enjoys a wide variety of dishes, my fav being the yellow tail with jalape\\u00f1os and lemongrass, lobster tacos, miso <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> and this last visit we tried the <mark>12 Oz Ribeye Tobanyaki</mark> and it was out if this world. even though stuffed one of my friends threatened to order another bowl of the awesome <mark>Coconut Rice</mark> just to not leave an life of the sauce the meat was made in because it had to be eaten.\n\nwe had an extraordinary server that evening but i unfor<mark>Tuna</mark> i can't remember his name!! he reminded us of marky mark in a way.",

            "delicious food and awesome service.\n\ni had the spicy lemongrass ramen, <mark>Tuna Tataki</mark>, lamb robata, <mark>Organic Chicken</mark> robata, yellowtail tacos, <mark>Coconut Rice</mark>, anago nigiri, unagi nigiri, and <mark>Sao Paulo</mark> sushi roll.\n\nall of the food were delicious! this place is a fusion of japanese, peruvian, and brazilian. most of the portion sizes were tapa style,so you gota order several dishes.\n\nthe ramen was well flavored with the spices. the noodle itself were ok, but all of the veggies and <mark>Berkshire Pork Belly</mark> were soaked in the broth, which made them all taste delicious.\n\ni don't have much complaint, maybe i can go without the tacos and chicken robata. you have to try the lamb because it's super tender and well flavored. the portion is slightly bigger, but order more if needed.\n\nrolls were small, but it's cute and has plenty of fish to rice ratio.\n\ni would come back again!", 
            "i ate here last week. i initially enjoyed the ambiance, the nice wait staff, and the wide selection of sushi, robata, and cocktails. however, our food and drinks were littered with inedible garnishes. one of our drinks contained inedible wood sticks and leaves, while the plate came with a side of hollowed out crustacean appendages.\n\nwhile i understand that the harvested tree parts add to the flavor of the drink, the crustacean carcases added nothing to the plate other than to disgust their customers. it was sickening. i almost sent the food back, but i decided to give it a try.\n\nfor<mark>Tuna</mark> the food and drinks were decent. they weren't memorable in the sense that i will tell my friends and family about it, but the food and drinks were a good attempt at sushi, robata, and cocktails. i would give the quality of the food 3 stars.\n\nhowever, when i spoke with the manager about the disproportionate amount of inedible food on the plate, he was extremely rude to me. instead of explaining why the presentation was the way it was, he simply said \"this is the way we make it,\" and he walked away. anyone in a customer service centric job can tell you this is the wrong way to respond to a custom complaint.\n\nat the end of the evening my wife and i were left feeling that we were overcharged, under-served, and disrespected by the management. i could forgive the obvious technical errors with the food if the staff was more comm<mark>Uni</mark>, but the interaction i had with the evening under-experienced manager only added insult to injury, which is why i give this restaurant 1 star.", 
            "by far the best sushi, sashimi, tempura, green tea i've had. great service! do try the <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> roll! totally recommended!", 
            "my husband and i celebrated my birthday here on a saturday night! great atmosphere ensured we were in for a fun night. we loved the cocktails and the service was amazing, all of our recommendations were amazing!! take note of what we ordered as it was a perfect menu - we ordered all share plates, <mark>Tuna Tataki</mark>, yellow tail ceviche, yellow tail tacos (a must order), wagu goyza (get these), the rock tail shrimp and a tuna crunchy roll. the food was amazing - i am getting hungry just thinking about it. we had desert as well and based on recommendations from our waitress we ordered the banana & the pumpkin cinnamon donuts!!! so good - go here it was a great experience!!!!", 
            "this is my favorite restaurant in vegas! the space itself is dark / trendy and has crazy beams and accents running across the ceilings and walls. we started off with the yellowtail taquitos. they were absolutely delicious! i still dream of how fresh the fish was and how it was so well balanced by the crispiness of the taco. unfor<mark>Tuna</mark>, the portions were so small! at $6 per taquito, i was expecting something more filling. \n\ni had the <mark>Sao Paulo</mark> roll as my entree. this is basically a rainbow roll that you'd get at any other sushi restaurant. i was impressed by the quality of the fish and the sauces on the side. at $24, however, the price seemed a bit steep for a standard roll. \n\nif you're looking for quality japanese fusion food here, don't hesitate to stop by sushisamba! you won't be disappointed, but you may have to shell out a bit more cash than expected. would love to do the custom tasting menu, but maybe another time.", 
            "such a disappointing dinner! no one wants to walk away from their nice vegas dinner feeling disappointed- that's what the blackjack tables are for!\n\nhere's what we didn't like:\nthe service: our waiter would walk away mid sentence to attend to another table. um hello? finish your sentence! \n\nthe food and drinks: we unfor<mark>Tuna</mark> didn't like anything we tried and we tried many of the sushi and sashimi options on the menu. for a place that has sushi in its name, the sushi was a huge letdown.\n\nthe bathrooms: weird creepy stalls with sliding doors that reminded me of an airplane toilet and not very clean! \n\nwhy 2 stars instead of one?\n-our water was refilled constantly! (that's big in my book!)\n-possibly the happy hour menu is better? or the meat instead of sushi? trying to give them the benefit of the doubt.\n-they are open late!\n\nwith so many better places to eat on the strip, i'd suggest skipping sushisamba.", 
            "hands down the best sushi experience ever! i took my boyfriend and i out here because lord knows we needed a break from work! our reservation was for 11:30pm and due to us trying to find their location, we unfor<mark>Tuna</mark> was late. we arrived at about 11:52pm and went straight to the hostess, where she was very nice and stylish if i might add. she relayed to us that it was ok that we were late because they're open till 1am anyway. her reassurance helped us to calm down, because we both like to be punctual. for that, i am grateful!\n\nour experience on the dining side of it all was beyond words exceptional. our server was tee, she definitely was enthusiastic about being our server. others came to drop our plates off but she mainly catered to us from beginning to end. she started us off with drinks and we never once had to ask for a refill she always was alert. we didn't know what to get so she offered her favorites and personal suggestions. we indulged in <mark>Crispy Hokkaido Scallop</mark> and <mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark> which is tempura style tofu. being from hawai'i, we both love rice! so this fit us perfectly! we had a roll each of <mark>Rainbow Dragon</mark> and a lima roll! simple yet tasty, perfect for any occasion. we had dessert and we had a samba split which was amazingggg!!! i had on the side some mochi ice cream and i couldn't stop eating on both dishes! my boyfriend definitely loved the samba split because of the caramelized banana's and the doce de leite ice cream together and caramel popcorn; my favorite part of it was the coconut flan and the japanese whisky whipped cream together and altogether was phenomenal experience.\n\nambiance was very quaint but vivid; artistry was displayed very nicely. lights were dimmed so it made the experience very more intimate which i enjoyed. i would recommend everyone to go here for any reason very good prices for good portions!", 
            "i love sushisamba! i was very familiar with the london location and this was actually my 2nd visit to the vegas location. the food never disappoints at either venue and if you are new to the brand i would recommend having the server either order for you or working closely with them to craft your own \"tasting menu\".  the concept of japanese, peruvian and brazilian can be intimidating and unfamiliar to most but you have to just go with it! \n\nwe let the manager, jason p, order for us and we couldn't have been happier! he was super friendly and asked about any allergies and dietary restrictions and got everything on point. we had an assortment of small plates: <mark>Green Bean Tempura</mark>, edamame, pardon peppers, a <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> roll, some <mark>Crispy Hokkaido Scallop</mark> lettuce wrap, assorted taquitos of yellow tail / lobster / crab and <mark>Mushroom Tobanyaki</mark> with <mark>Duck Breast</mark>. everything was cooked and seasoned perfectly and the staff even made a point to let us know which items to eat first to enjoy at the best possible temperature. everyone we encountered was friendly, engaging, knowledgeable on the menus and so hospitable! \n\nto sum it up, jason p and the whole ss team know what they're freaking doing and i can't wait to go back!", 
            "we checked out this place over the weekend for a girlfriend's bachelorette celebration, and had a fantastic time.\n\ni don't remember our server's name, but he was very attentive, patient and focused on providing the best possible experience. we had a vegetarian in our group, and he was kind enough to tell us about the vegetarian options and even provide a vegan menu for us to explore. my only quip would be the restaurant's \"set your own price & we'll customize the menu \" option - when we heard about it, we were immediately enthusiastic and decided to set a $25 per head price. unfor<mark>Tuna</mark> the server told us that the restaurant wanted a $50 per head minimum for that option... seems a little strange to me. \n\nwe ended up ordering off the a la carte menu, which was fantastic. we opted for:\n\nseared ahi <mark>Tuna Tataki</mark>: yum! each slice of seared ahi tuna was served atop a spinach leave and with a delightful sauce. absolutely delicious. i could have made a meal out of this dish alone (if i didn't have to share...hehe).\n\notsumami - blistered shishito peppers, edamame and <mark>Green Bean Tempura</mark>: we originally planned to order a standard edamame bowl, but we followed our server's recommendation to order this instead. so glad we did! the dish was a perfect portion for 5 hungry people. a few in our group hadn't tried shishito peppers before, so they were absolutely wowed. the tempura was decent - not mindblowing by any standards, but definitely not oily or soggy like some other tempura variations.\n\nlima roll: this roll was fantastic. i like tempura shrimp when it's not in sushi, and this roll definitely changed my mind on that - it was absolutely delicious.\n\namazonia roll: our vegetarian friend loved this roll. it's wonderful that sushisamba has this option, since the <mark><mark>Osetra Caviar Imperial 20g</mark> 20g</mark>, sweet potato and cucumber rolls can get a little boring for our herbivore friends.\n\nsao paolo roll: my personal favorite! extremely delicious. such an amazing combination of flavors and textures. \n\nsomehow, we all had room for dessert and opted for the mango tres leites cake. it was served with a dollop of mango ice cream and a matcha green tea dipping sauce. overall, a truly delicious end to a fantastic meal. i can't wait to visit the sushisamba in new york!", 
            "close to perfect as a sushi restaurant can be here at the palazzo. a tad high priced but it's las vegas. even the basic <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> roll is outstanding! the yellowtail tacos are delicious and the cocktails are fresh. two thumbs up!", 
            "absolutely delicious! we went with a large group and they offer tasting menus - which would have been a good idea but we had a lot of different sushi favorites so we all ordered separately. \n\ni started with a <mark>Tuna Tataki</mark> appetizer that may have been the best i've ever had. the tuna was perfectly seasoned and seared. my mouth started drooling thinking about it. i wanted 10 more pieces. \n\ni then had a roll but i cannot for the life of me remember the name. it was slightly tempura but delicious. great size as well. \n\ni went for a bachelorette weekend and they gave us two free cocktail towers which was extremely nice. \n\noverall very great experience here. we stayed at the venetian so the location also helped!", 
            "in early may i was in las vegas on business and wanted to entertain some colleagues for dinner. we were a party of eleven and with that many pallets to please, we needed something different, we needed sushisamba. \n\na couple people in the group had been here before and spoke highly of the fusion restaurant, but for many of us this would be our first time so we made a reservation for 7pm. typically when we travel for business there is always one or two people who join your group at the last minute, so we held a table for thirteen just in case. \n\nmost of us arrived to the restaurant on time however two people were running a few minutes late but on their way. unfor<mark>Tuna</mark> because we were not a party of ten, the server refused to seat us, even though it would only be a few minutes for them to arrive. she also said they could only hold our reservation for 10 minutes.  needless to say, they arrived in time, but i thought that it was not only a poor business decision to seat us early (most people will enjoy a cocktail or two while waiting) but just rude. \n\nwe were seated in the far back of the restaurant and the servers were very attentive. they quickly explained the brazilian-peruvian-japanese fusion concept of the restaurant and then without missing a beat he began to pitch us on the \"chef's choice\" option to the menu. i will admit, it was a good pitch, but obviously too good to be true. with this option the chef would listen to our likes and dislikes and create dishes that appeal to our tastes based on our budget, much like when dining at a chef's table.  the catch to this.... the restaurant was packed, there is no way the kitchen is creating anything special for us.... they're just serving menu items that will maximize your budget and increase your check. \n\nsadly five of us fell for it and ordered the \"chef's choice\" menu, the rest of us ordered ala carte and decided we would share plates amongst each other and asked for separate checks.  funny enough most of the plates that were being served off the \"chef's choice\" menu were the same plates we ordered, but with a few exceptions.  the food was good.  it by no means blew me away, but nothing i ate was bad and i really cant find anything negative to say about it. we had a number of small dishes that included edamame, <mark>Seaweed Salad</mark>, rock shrimp and <mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark>, plus an assortment of sushi rolls. \n\nthe checks came and as expected the \"chef's choice\" total was nearly $100 more than the ala carte (and we had an extra person).  i signed the bill, put the receipt in my wallet and didn't look at it again until i got back to the office and had to submit my expenses. \n\nas i reviewed the bill i took notice to the quantities of the plates ordered. we specifically ordered different items knowing that we were sharing, so i was surprised to see that i had duplicates on five items. i know we all liked the rock shrimp and ordered another plate, so that wasn't a concern. however there was only one other questionable roll that no one recalls ordering and the other three were definitely not ordered, delivered or consumed.... but we paid for it. \n\nwe aren't talking about a lot of money here - $36 - $55, but it's the fact we were obviously taken advantage of.  maybe the waiter wanted a bigger tip, perhaps the restaurant wanted to recoup some funds because we didn't take the \"chef's choice\"? either way i wrote the management group letting them know of my disappointment.  in the end i got an email from the general manager offering to return my $36 with an apology. \n\n\nas a chef, when i am dining out i expect my experience to meet an acceptable level of expectations that may differ from others, however lets face it, with so many choices available these days a restaurant has to be spot on to keep you coming back.  apparently in this case sushisamba needs the money more than i do as i will not be going back.", 
            "i love sushisamba. i always come when in vegas. i was there on a sunday for lunch . we started with the anticuchos with <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark>... these were amazing!  the corn was much bigger than american corn and garnished with some sweet sauce. their sushi is always delicious and fresh i love their salmon roll  and <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> were my favorite .the staff was super friendly and the food came out super fast. always happy to come here.", 
            "so we just finished a late night meal here. i consider me and my fianc\\u00e9 to be sushi connoisseurs. we found it to be just 'meh. but than again, we have been blown away at other restaurants and after all this is a chain....\n\nanyway, we got here after 11pm and were seated. we specifically came here for the happy hour but were told after being seated, happy hour menu is at the bar only. you mean the 15 seat bar? we don't drink so i declined. not to forget, it's no where stated on the menu... our mediocre late night snack came to $70....\n\nshould stuck to my rule of only dining where the locals go. \n\n<mark>Salt and Pepper Squid</mark>- good. not overly fried. lime was nice touch.\n\n<mark>Samba Strip</mark>, <mark>Salmon Avocado</mark> and <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark>... nothing fancy and have had way better.", 
            "food was ok,  a little over priced (3 pieces of yellowtail sashimi, one <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> roll and a beer - $45 before tip).\ni don't recommend sitting at the \"sushi bar\" . the guys are not sushi chefs, just bored guys waiting for an order to fill. . there is no interaction (you have to wait for the server to come around to order your sushi, then wait for them to deliver it), so you spend your meal time with bored guys in front of your and your back to the restaurant. ... oh. .and fricken flies! ! i spent the mealtime swatting away flies. .not exactly what one wants to see when dealing with raw fish :-/\n\nacoustics are horrible,  everyone is yelling trying to be heard. .\n\ni probably won't eat here again.. i prefer a more. .. <mark><mark>Osetra Caviar Imperial 20g</mark> 20g</mark> bar. ..", 
            "had lunch here for the first time.  nothing that blew me out of the water but very interesting flavors.  yellowtail tacos were well done with the spicy foam sauce. yellowtail ceviche and salmon ceviche- maybe i was expecting fresh surprise like nobu's flavored sashimi but it fell quite a bit short. their <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> was okay but not great. <mark><mark>Osetra Caviar Imperial 20g</mark> 20g</mark> was excellent where you can taste the freshness.  my favorite was the tempura green beans.  it was fun trying all these new flavors.  i would recommend for as an adventure.", 
            "i've stayed at the venetian/palazzo a dozen times and had never eaten at sushi samba. what a terrible mistake i've made all these years. looking for a restaurant in the hotel for our bachelor party, we decided upon sushisamba due to the variety of dishes, the vibrant atmosphere, and positive word of mouth reviews. we made a reservation through opentable, and were promptly seated upon arrival.\n\nsamba proclaims to have the most extensive sake selection in vegas, and we let our server choose a cheaper bottle for us and it was delicious. \n\n1) japanese a5 <mark>Seared W<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> Beef</mark> gyoza (4.5/5) - you get 5 delicious pot stickers with quality beef that just melts in your mouth\n\n2) yellowtail taquito (5/5) - there are two mandatory dishes to get and this is one of them. essentially a mini taco with yellowtail, roasted corn miso, and avocado. the explosion of flavor was mind-numbingly good and even friends who don't enjoy seafood loved this\n\n3) yellowtail sashimi (4.5/5) - 4 slices of high quality yellowtail, the sauce is delicate and sour\n\n4)  <mark>Berkshire Pork Belly</mark> (3.75/5) - i am admittedly biased towards <mark>Berkshire Pork Belly</mark> so i loved the dish. the butterscotch miso on top was a little overwhelming but the <mark>Berkshire Pork Belly</mark> itself was cooked to perfection\n\n5) <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> anticucho (5/5) - this is the other mandatory dish. we were very for<mark>Tuna</mark> because the table next to us came 15 minutes after and they ran out of this dish! the <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> skewer is  their signature dish and deservedly so. two skewers of <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> cooked so perfectly (soft on inside, slightly crispy exterior), there aren't enough superlatives to describe how delicious it is. \n\n6) <mark>Rio Grande</mark> (4/5) - from their churrasco menu, includes three types of meat: ribeye, chorizo, and w<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> picanha. i would not suggest this if you are eating by yourself or with another because it is just so much meat. in a larger group setting, i think this dish is perfect to share. the w<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> picanha is my favorite because the meat was so soft and tender.\n\nquite simply, i loved my experience at sushisamba. the service was fantastic. the food was <mark>Uni</mark> and delicious at the same time. the atmosphere embodies that of vegas- vibrant and exciting. the price of the dinner was what i'd expect from a \"strip\" restaurant, so be prepared to spend at least $50. \n\ni can't wait to go back to sushisamba for some yellowtail tacos and <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>.",

(to be honest, i just wanted to fill my stomach so that i'd be able to drink later!) luckily, one of our friends is a sushi samba master, and he did all of the ordering for our table. \n\ni pretty much loved everything - if only for the novelty of it all - but a few stand-out dishes were:\n1) yellowtail ceviche taquito: they looked like little yellowtail and guacemole tacos. somehow it all worked...\n2) yellowtail tiradito: kinda like a ceviche? yellowtail, jalepeno, and lemongrass - i'm definitely a fan of sour and spicy.\n3) fresh oysters and <mark><mark>Jumbo Shrimp</mark></mark>: no explanations needed.\n4) <mark>El Topo</mark> roll: salmon, jalepeno, melted cheese, and crispy onions\n\ni also would recommend getting a side of <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark> (which went along with our churrasco plate) just to see how huge those kernels are! it's kind of ridiculous. anyway, not only was the food great, but the service was among the best - they even have a \"sake sommelier\", so to speak. the place itself is energetic, contemporary, and very, very vegas. i can't wait to go back!",

            "delicious drinks and food, and the bar tenders/servers rock! they have a happy hour that starts at 11pm, with the only catch being that you have to eat/drink at the bar. we preferred this as the music inside the restaurant was at night club volume. our order included <mark><mark>Jumbo Shrimp</mark></mark> seviche (amazing), the <mark>El Topo</mark> roll (it's so <mark>Uni</mark> they trademarked it), the <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark> roll, and shisito peppers. with our food and five drinks later (2 mojitos and 3 caipirinhas), our bill was $65. if you're staying at the palazzo or anywhere in vegas for that matter, it's definitely worth a visit.",

            "i had doubt on this place. \n\nhow would brazilian food work well with japanese food? i only love authentic japanese food. i sure can have the typical combination, but i only see that as american japanese food. \n\nsometimes i feel like a restaurant that does fusion because it does not have a firm grip to do the real deal. \n\nbut this place changed my mind. it earned my respect. i ordered some grill items, some sushi rolls, and some nigiri. the nigiri was done properly. the portion of rice and fish was proper. i enjoyed two of the sushi rolls: yamato (tuna, <mark>Foie Gras</mark>, <mark><mark>Osetra Caviar Imperial 20g</mark> 20g</mark>, gold leaf) and <mark>Rainbow Dragon</mark> (freshwater eel, red bell pepper, cucumber, mango, avocado). i know, the <mark>Rainbow Dragon</mark> roll sounds like a stable nowadays (like chicken teriyaki). but i was surprised by the use of mango in the roll. the mango gave that interesting bite to it. the yamato roll was a surprise - i didn't expect <mark>Foie Gras</mark> would go so well with ahi tuna. but the gold leave was pointless (in my opinion) other than giving a bling bling (and charge extra expensive) for the roll. \n\nthe seviches was just ok (i.e. within expectation). but the robata was good - we had fillet mignon and lamb. we also had japanese kobe beef (well, we were travelling at vegas - so we just splurged on our food instead of spending it at the outlet). it was good. but i think it's overpriced. if you haven't had japanese kobe beef before, you don't have to try it at this place unless you are ready to spend some money or to celebrate your win at the casino. \n\nthe decor has those typical hip restaurant vibe. the harajuku graffiti was a bit awkward to me but i guess most customers will think that's cool. but i wasn't impressed by the video that was played by the restaurant when i was there. we were there for an early dinner (to catch a show at the hotel). so we were there around 5:45. and the restaurant was playing some party video was not that respectful in my opinion. pretty much you only see a brunch of people partying and dancing and showing their skins. (only a few step away from girls gone wild japanese party version). there were some close up of girls' legs and cleavage that kinda bothered me. \n\nluckily, some customers requested to watch something else. it was the time about the bailout plan and eventually the large screen was showing news. \n\nso the party video took that star away. \n\nalthough it's kinda dark in the restaurant, i saw a couple with two young kids having dinner as well. it's not necessary kids friendly but kids are welcome. \n\nbut the food at this place was surprisingly good. so, it's worth to give a try. and if you are catching a show, the restaurant will make sure you will be able to make it. :)", 
            "well it was conveniently located in the palazzo and was my perfect spot for a quick lunch at the bar.. i have been to the sushi samba in nyc and in south beach they are always consistent i love the look and the vibe from the 1 in vegas..  i got the yamato roll and soon as i tried it i wanted to cry they incorporated my fav things into a roll and it seriously was the best roll that has ever crossed my lips..  <mark>Foie Gras</mark> on top of tuna on top of rice topped with gold flakes..  yummmmmmmmmy.... i managed to go there for this roll every day for lunch lol its small its only 3 pieces but for me it was 3 pieces of heaven... ; )", 
            "good sushi with a twist. they have some <mark>Uni</mark> flavors and rolls: bobo brazil, yamato (<mark>Foie Gras</mark>, caviar, toro) and a few others. <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> was pretty disappointing.\n\ncareful when ordering the kobe, it's $27 an ounce usually a 5oz minimum. my smart friend ordered 10oz's off the bat thinking it was only $27 total. i am not sure of the name, but the kobe cooked on a hot rock is delicious. worth $150 per order? just for the experience. \n\nif you could gamble $50 a hand on blackjack or pai gow, why not eat it as well?  \n\npros: <mark>Uni</mark> rolls and flavors\n\ncons: very pricey ($2 for wasabi haha), mediocre service both times i went", 
            "i'm not a sushi purist, i love the fusion crap :)  i would give them 4 stars but they ran out of <mark>Alaskan King Crab</mark>.  how do you run out of something that makes up the base for many different items/rolls u serve.  we ordered something called the yamato roll which was pretty good except for the fact that it was $19 for 3 pieces.  it was the only roll that didn't have the standard 5-6 pieces.  for that much money i was expecting much more pop.  i love anything with <mark>Foie Gras</mark> so i may have liked the yamato roll more than i should've.  however, if you don't like <mark>Foie Gras</mark> skip it and get something else.  the miso <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> was fantastic just like the waiter described.  what bothers me is that they keep telling you how little the portions are after u order the dish which makes u order it twice or more  if you're with two plus people.  the miso <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> was like $16 for one skewer.  the food is good but be warned if you want to leave full you will spend a lot of money.  good thing it was comped thanks to my buddy.\n\nps  the chef's sushi/sashime does not come with straight sashime.  it was one sushi roll with some nigiri.", 
            "great asian fusion restaurant.  i ate mostly sushi rolls and they all were delicious.  the best was this roll with tuna topped with a little gold leaf and <mark>Foie Gras</mark>.  they also had this awesome mushroom appetizer.  the dishes are like asian tapas, small and meant to be consumed in mass quantities.  thus only the 4 star rating as the dishes were extremely small for the price.  i understand that this is a restaurant in vegas, which is going to be overpriced, but it just seemed to be a little over the top for what you were getting.", 
            "sushi samba puts an excellent spin on <mark><mark>Osetra Caviar Imperial 20g</mark> 20g</mark>.  the fusion of japanese and south american flavors are a perfect combination.  since i like my food on the spicy side, i found that sushi samba adds that flare to usually very neutral sushi.  \n\nthe one dish i found to be my favorite of the visit was the hamachi (yellowtail) sashimi tiradito.  hamachi is always a great choice for its oil content, but along with the spicy/tangy sauce it is served on is a more than suitable replacement for shoyu.  i also tried the yamato roll, which is sushi with maguro and  <mark>Foie Gras</mark>, a great and <mark>Uni</mark> flavor.  one disappointment i found was the kobe beef sushi.  i would rather have had otoro.  one last recommendation, don't order collard greens at a sushi place.  it was decent although it was no southern style collard greens that i prefer.  \n\ni will definitely go back to sushi samba the next time i am in vegas.  there are so many things on the menu that i still want to try!", 
            "yum!\n\ncame here for dinner whilst on vacation. cute place with a bar area and then more extensive seating for the restaurant area. our party of 3 ordered an appetizer of kobe beef (super super pricey! our waitress had to inform us that the actual price was even more expensive than what was listed on the menu) and i wanted yellowtail so we got the hamachi sashimi tiradito. the kobe was really tender and delicious; we got to cook it on a hot rock ourselves. it came with an assortment of sauces and oils and salts, but my preference was just to dip it in the sesame oil before cooking it and then getting a few grains of the black rock salt to stick to the edge of the meat before eating it. the tiradito was yummy too. it came with a tangy spicy, ginger-y sauce (that was also given to us with the kobe) and was topped with little red jalepeno slices (and since i love spicy foods, that was awesome to me).\n\nfor main entr\\u00e9es, we ordered the chef special sushi platter and asked to make sure they gave us the 'yamato' as one of the rolls (which is really fancy with <mark>Foie Gras</mark> and tuna and <mark><mark>Osetra Caviar Imperial 20g</mark> 20g</mark> gold leaf). we also ordered the 'bobo brazil' which contains kobe beef and chimichurri (one of my favorite sauces) amongst other things, and the '<mark>Rainbow Dragon</mark>' which had a wasabi pea crust on it, which made the texture really interesting (in a good way).\n\nto go with our meal, we also ordered several different kinds of sake. we ended up having the manager (who is an avid sake enthusiast and has been to japan many times to find delicious sake for the restaurant) help us out with choosing the right sake to go with our dishes. we started off with an unfiltered, super fruity, sweet sake which i fell in love with. i'm not a big fan of sake usually, but this one was really good. the other ones we tried were all pretty good too (light and i could barely taste the alcohol) but they were all overshadowed by the first one we had.\n\nsince we had already racked up a pretty extensive bill with all the food that we ordered, we decided to splurge on a little dessert too. i ordered the 'carmen miranda' which is just seasonal fruits with a little cake and yuzu sorbet. the sorbet was tart and refreshing and a nice way to end the meal (like a palette cleanser and breath saver! haha). someone else ordered the warm chocolate banana cake. our server told us it was the most popular dessert but warned us that it was super rich and heavy. it came out in a huge flying saucer shaped dish with a tiny dip in the middle to hold the dessert. i didn't taste it but it definitely smelled and looked amazing and the guy who ordered it seemed to enjoy it.\n\noh! and the highlight of the night was when the dj started playing some fedde le grand tracks!! gawd. a meal encompasses not only the food, but the ambiance, and that was perfect for me. (the dj was set up in a really accessible location, so i'm sure you could go and request stuff if the music you're hearing isn't adding to your meal).", 
            "sushi samba has a pretty delicious menu. i am a big fan of the variety they had to offer. the sashimi was extremely fresh, each bite was a taste of buttery heaven! the <mark>Foie Gras</mark> roll was one my favorite for the night along with the tuna and salmon sashimi pieces. the place is yes, pricey but it was an experience.. =)", 
            "3.5 stars. for a party of 2, we ordered:\n\nyamato roll: tuna, <mark>Foie Gras</mark>, <mark><mark>Osetra Caviar Imperial 20g</mark> 20g</mark>, gold leaf\n<mark>Tuna Tataki</mark>\nuni nigiri (6 orders: only 1 piece per order)\nhamachi sashimi\n\nyamato roll was expensive and small. i can understand why it's expensive but the price wasn't worth paying. i absolutely love tuna, <mark>Foie Gras</mark>, and <mark><mark>Osetra Caviar Imperial 20g</mark> 20g</mark> that's why we ordered it.....but all those together on a roll just wasn't to my liking.\n\n<mark>Tuna Tataki</mark> was above average but nothing to rave about. every place puts their own spin on <mark>Tuna Tataki</mark>. so, me being the tuna lover that i am...we had to try it. i've had better. it wasn't memorable.\n\nhamachi sashimi was suprisingly fresh. we were hesitant to order it because we were thinking las vegas wouldn't have fresh fish. we were surprised.\n\nuni nigiri was the best i've ever had anywhere so far. very surprised! also liked the nori (seaweed) around the uni because it wasn't too chewy. they don't put wasabi in the middle which is a plus for me since i don't like wasabi.\n\nthe good: 1.5 stars for the uni alone, 1 star for the fun atmoshphere, and 1 star for the large menu selection. \n\nthe bad: wait time, tables too close together, and it's a bit pricey for what you get.", 
            "this was hands down the worst dining experience i have ever had. i chose this restaurant to celebrate a dear friend's 30th birthday because i had read numerous positive reviews online.\n\nthe hostess who answered the phone was courteous and professional and we were able to get a prime reservation on a saturday night. the good stopped there. \n\nour server was unbelievably rude and unhelpful with the menu. his only obvious desire was to up-sell us on all of the choices we made. i understand the desire to up-sell, but there is a way to do this in a genuine less greedy manner. i would have ordered more drinks if he had even bothered to check on our table, but that seemed to be above him.\n\nthe <mark>Seaweed Salad</mark> arrived and it was both mushy and very under seasoned.\n\nthen, the real culinary horror arrived: a plate of sushi samba's signature sushi rolls. one roll was topped with burnt <mark>Foie Gras</mark> that also tasted a rancid. i mentioned it to the waiter the one and only time he came to check on our table and he told me that, \"everyone else really likes that roll. i'll have to talk to my manager.\" ummmm???  why wouldn't you offer me something else from the menu? why would you let a patron leave dissatisfied?\n\nand that was the last time we ever saw him. it was as though we had offended him and for the rest of the evening he completely ignored us. we waited over 20 minutes for our check to come after the table had been cleared.  i almost got up and left. what an insult to have chosen a restaurant for such a special occasion and then to be treated so poorly.\n\ni would like to note that the bussing staff was excellent. they provided seamless clearing of our plates and refilling of our water.\n\nall in all, sushi samba i hate you for ruining such a special night.",

            "if you want to try some sushi that's prepared with a delightful spin then this place is perfect for you. the atmosphere resembles a club more than a high class restaurant.  it's filled with fast-paced dance music and most of the guests are dressed like they are ready for the club after dinner. \n\nthe defining feature of the restaurant comes from its mixture of japanese and brazilian cuisine. our server recommended the seviches and tiraditos; since we couldn't decide which one to get we ordered both! seviches are sashimi served in a fruit/salsa. we had tiger shrimp in a mango salsa and tuna with grapefruit and jalapenos. the sashimi was super fresh and i loved the fruit/salsa combo.  it was sweet and refreshing. tiraditos are sashimi immersed in a tangy sauce, probability the only dish i wasn't too fond of though.  the sauce was too sour and it overwhelmed the fish. \n\nif eating an endangered animal does not affect your conscience i would highly recommend the chilean <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> skewers. the fish was amazing, the meat practically flakes off on its own and the unagi sauce was so umami! \n\ni saved the best for last. imagine eating all of the finest food: <mark>Foie Gras</mark>, <mark><mark>Osetra Caviar Imperial 20g</mark> 20g</mark> gold?!?! all in one bite. hurry to sushisamba and order the yamato roll.  at first the combination of those above ingredient wrapped in a tuna roll may seem excessive, but it absolutely worked.  it is the best roll i ever had.  the <mark><mark>Osetra Caviar Imperial 20g</mark> 20g</mark> gold were subtle, but the <mark>Foie Gras</mark>, infused its smoky buttery flavor to an otherwise ordinary but fresh tuna roll, made it special. i would like to add, the <mark>Foie Gras</mark> was one of the finest i have ever eaten and it came from a sushi restaurant.\n\ntry sushisamba if you are in vegas to get a delectable and <mark>Uni</mark> sushi experience.",

            "i like sushisamba a lot.  it was a fun restaurant with a cool, modern vibe to it.  it is definitely one of the more trendy sushi restaurants that i have been to.  in no way am i putting sushisamba up there with my favorite japanese restaurant, sushi ran in san francisco.  but it was definitely worth trying out.\n\ni didn't try the omakase, but i wanted to.  i was with my wife, who doesn't like anything but meat and vegetable tempura, so i didn't want to be limited.  so we just ordered off the menu, which was fine.  the rolls here are definitely different then i'm used to.  what with all of the <mark>Foie Gras</mark> and <mark>Seared W<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> Beef</mark>.  the <mark>Neo Tokyo</mark> roll was tasty.  i liked the tuna and tempura flakes together.  i also had the hamachi nigiri and the uni nigiri, both of which were very good.  i love uni, and this was good.\n\nwe had the seasonal vegetable tempura, which was good.  to be honest, i've had better tempura but by no means am i saying that this wasn't a good dish.  i like vegetable tempura, so i would order this again.  we also had the the three meat <mark>Rio Grande</mark> churrasco.  we chose the pork tenderloin, the hanger steak and the ribeye.  the hanger steak was by far the best of the three, with the ribeye coming in second.  it was so tasty.  the pork tenderloin was a bit disappointing.  it was dry and uneventful.  next time, i'm getting three orders of the hanger steak.  and the sauces were a nice complement to the dish.\n\nsushisamba is fun.  the food is good.  and the staff is very helpful and knowledgeable.  i had fun here, and i think that adds a lot to your experience at any restaurant.  i can say that i am a fan.", 
            "sushisamba provides an interesting mix of japanese, brazilian, and peruvian flavors.  the interior is dimly lit and contemporary; a very attractive dining space.\n\ni was with a large party, and our server put together a tasting menu that was within our desired price range and provided a diverse portrait of the cuisine the restaurant offers.  the service was excellent, and dealt with our group very well.  there was one drink order that seemed to have been forgotten, but these errors can happen.  when it was brought to the server's attention, it was dealt with promptly and apogetically.  \n\nour meal consisted of about ten small-plates, portioned for sharing among the table.  while every dish was enjoyable, there were definite highlights.  my personal favorites were the yellowtail ceviche taquitos, and a decadent sushi roll that was topped with <mark>Foie Gras</mark>, <mark>Berkshire Pork Belly</mark>, and gold leaf.  \n\nthe accomodating service and <mark>Uni</mark> culinary influences of sushisamba make for a brilliant dining experience.",

            "my friend ems really loves this place so she took me here awhile ago for dinner. \n\ndecor is pretty nice, a bit on the dark side but is a bit on the noisy side. i found myself nearly yelling a few times just to have a conversation with my friends. \n\nfood though is excellent. we had the ceviche dish that we got to choose four different types. excellent. i really recommend getting that. we also got a few sushi rolls, one of which was the <mark>Foie Gras</mark> roll. a must. so good, a bit pricey but what do you expect with <mark>Foie Gras</mark>. totally worth the money. \n\nwe ended up ordering a dessert but it was nothing to really note. overall though the food was amazing. definitely a good spot for japanese!", 
            "man, i love this place. i should have reviewed it sooner, before i decided that i was going to only eat vegetarian on tuesdays (and mondays, and wednesdays. argh!). ah, such is life.\n\nbut, the great news is, they do have delicious vegetarian options! i quit drinking and even their mocktails were mouthwatering! i had the watermelon mojo and really felt like having no alcohol was a-ok! it was so sweet and so watermelon-y. they could have just kept filling my glass up, but thinking about the sugar content gave me pause. so, i had one. it was all i needed to know that their mocktails are fab!\n\nfor appetizers we ordered the otsumami. it was good a combination of edamame, <mark>Green Bean Tempura</mark> and shishito and i couldn't stop eating it! really perfect size for a group (unless you have someone like me who hoards it for themselves, then, problems). the green beans were like never ending. i put one in my mouth and then another and another, breaking every now and again for the shishito, which is sweet (but spicy) peppers. man, i could have eaten that for days. \n\nthis time we just ordered two rolls. because one wasn't vegetarian i didn't partake, but as with all things sushisamba, it looked delicious! the other was the veggie kun and it was really great. the flavors blended nicely (there are a lot of ingredients in this roll) and sort of melted in my mouth. i would highly recommend. i also wish they had more vegetarian options, though this was plenty at the time.\n\nthis is my second time here, the first time i had the yamato roll. holy. i was a huge fan of <mark>Foie Gras</mark> at the time and to have that on a roll was so decadently delicious that it, right then and there, became my favorite sushi roll ever. i won't ever forget that, ever. \n\ni know vegas is known for a lot of really great ayce sushi places, but if you want something that transcends those and gives you a more cultured, elegant, tasteful experience, you can do no better than sushisamba.", 
            "i ate at this location recently and the one in chicago (in 2011)...i must say the chicago location was much better. our group was craving sushi so we stick to ordering mostly japanese food instead of the brazilian or peruvian dishes.\n\nsome of the dishes i remembered ordering were <mark>Samba Strip</mark> (terrible!!!), yamato, bobo brazil, extra crunchy salmon skin hand roll, <mark><mark>Samba Sushi & Sashimi</mark></mark>, uni, yellowtail ceviche tacos and some other stuff. the two best dishes were the yamato roll with <mark>Foie Gras</mark> and the uni (very fresh). everything else was so-so with the biggest disappointment was the <mark>Samba Strip</mark> roll. \n\noverall nothing was memorable. i was quite disappointed given my last experience in chicago was so mouthwatering i've been waiting to go to vegas to try again.", 
            "this was my second time here and after going to the chicago location, chicago rules all the way. the worst roll ever was the <mark>Samba Strip</mark> w/lobster, it looked like an amateur put it together. there was no flavor and for the price of $19, umm not! the only roll that was good was the yamato (<mark>Foie Gras</mark>) and bobo brazil (<mark>Seared W<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> Beef</mark>). \n\nhowever, you must order the coco duo, it was the bomb!!!",

            "this place was highly recommended by a friend, so we decided to stop by after watching panda. it was a thursday night, but the place is still pretty packed. but they were able to fit us in even without rsvn. the server was super friendly and quickly made recommendations after finding out its our first time there. all his recommendations were amazingly delicious, especially the <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> and <mark>Berkshire Pork Belly</mark>. but my absolute favorite: the roll with the <mark>Foie Gras</mark>, caviar, gold flakes on tuna (sorry, i'm bad with remembering names). you know that feeling when you put a piece of food in your mouth and immediately get overflown by amazing flavors that make your eyes roll back with a feeling of euphoria? yea, that good!",

            "there are some incredible offerings here, but you have to read the menu closely.  \n\nservice is not bad, but very substandard for vegas and this cuisine. expect kids who are distracted. \n\nthe best thing here is the yamato \"roll\" which is basically a tuna roll with <mark>Foie Gras</mark> and gold leaf on top. amazing. i recommend you try it.", 
            "sushisamba fuses japanese, peruvian, and brazilian flavors- peculiar, until you realize that brazil is home to the largest japanese population outside of japan itself.\n\nfrom edamame to plantains, wasabi to chiles, sushisamba is a true testament to the <mark>Uni</mark> tastes created by immigration and integration and the balanced evolution of these flavors over the last 100 years. \n\nhaving visited the las vegas location several times as well as the miami one, sushisamba is high on my list of culinary experiences that delights time after time.\n\namong my favorites is yamato roll, comprised of tuna, <mark>Foie Gras</mark>, <mark><mark>Osetra Caviar Imperial 20g</mark> 20g</mark>, topped with gold leaf. at $19 for 3 pieces, you may have to take a sledgehammer to that piggy bank, but you probably won't regret it.  \n\nanother outstanding roll is the bobo brazil, filled with avocado, kaiware, shiso, red onion, and chimichurri inside, layered with tender <mark>Seared W<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> Beef</mark> on the outside. every bite melds into the tongue and disappears in a flurry of flavor.\n\ni tried the kanpanchi tiradito on this last visit and didn't find it worth the $19. drizzled in yuzu, sea salt, black truffle oil, the 4 small slices of amberjack were acceptable but not exceptional.\n\non a final note, our waitress looked like a gorgeous supermodel, which worked out great in curbing my own appetite, thus making the meal more affordable. i already started a new piggy bank for next time.", 
            "it is very difficult for me to express how amazing my dining experience was at <mark>Samba Sushi</mark>. the waitress was super fun and helpful. we went there with the hopes of experiencing a \"one of a kind\" dining experience and we had just that. our waitress (can't remember her name because it is japanese) was really wonderful we told her to bring us some exciting options. she guided us through the menu and helped us choose some great options. we had a fifteen piece chef's choice that included mini crabs, <mark>Foie Gras</mark>, caviar, oysters, and some other types of fish. absolutely delightful. it was the perfect blend of tasty and adventurous. after the first plate we began to get very intrigued about the food and decided to order a selection of sashimi dishes which was also phenomenal. i have never tasted such amazing fish in my life. having spent nearly $180 dollars on a meal for two, i was more than satisfied. we'll worth the wait and the price. i can't wait to eat here again in the future!",

            "one of the many reasons i love the palazzo is the creepy-when-you-think-about-it facts that you can have a week long vacay and never really go outside. one of the other reasons i like the joint is... sushisamba. \n\nall fusion isn't created equal and most of what's deemed fusion in the multi-billion dollar tourist traps still doesn't cut it as top notch cuisine... but in three rotations over the years, the one thing i can say is that they've consistently delivered a good experience.  and that's more than i can say for a few others that are no longer at the palazzo.   it's also consistently noisy... do with that what you will. \n\nfavorites from the menu... <mark>Moqueca Mista</mark> (kinda hard to mess up fish stew with good ingredients ) and the <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> are my favorites of the full entries, which i wouldn't recommend on a first visit.  save big plates for your second or third go round.  almost anything with the w<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> is a hit; i think sushisamba drives the south american flavors home using fine japanese beef.  but if it works... \n\nthe yamato roll... epic as it is... to me, is **almost** overkill.  super indulgent <mark>Foie Gras</mark> and w<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> are almost a taste bud assault.   but at the same time, you have to try it-share it. the sa\\u00f5 paulo and the <mark>Neo Tokyo</mark> are my favorites here.   the <mark>Samba Strip</mark> is also pretty awesome.  again, pile enough good things together and see what happens. \n\nthe so so and not so on the menu... if anything ... rock shrimp (discontinued) and tiger <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark>.   mojitos are so so...( to me) as well.   the robata squid was literally hit and miss; had it once and it was great... and the next time... just rubber. \n\nall in all, come here with good company, a serious appetite and charge it to the room...i prefer early lunch or just after midnight.", 
            "i recently had one of the best meals of my life at sushisamba. i was visiting vegas on my own and decided to treat myself to a dinner at this restaurant that i used to love in chicago, before it shut down (sadly). it had been so long that i really got to try a lot of new things on the menu and i was in love with all of them.  i started out with a glass of sparkling rose because i'm classy like that. managers michael and jeremy gave me a primo spot to sip my bubbles and watch the fabulous crowd pour in for the dinner service. they also handed me a beautiful taster of their cucumber cocktail, which was fantastic. \n\nnext jeremy brought me over one of the yellow tail taquitos, which had a crisp shell and a flavorful foam to spoon on top. it was a great amuse bouche. along with that, i ordered the <mark>Seared W<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> Beef</mark> gyoza. the beef just melted in your mouth. it was so good. i tried to slow myself down to savor every bite of the tender meat in the dumplings. the sauce that came with them was also an integral part of their savory goodness. i think i could eat those dumplings every day until the day i die and still ask for them in heaven (or hell, depending on where i end up). \n\nthe next dish i ordered was the yamato sushi, which sounded like the absolute most decadent sushi roll i could ever possibly order. and it was. and i loved it. starting with white sushi rice, topped with flavorful fresh tuna, the smallest most perfect piece of <mark>Foie Gras</mark>, a dot of caviar, and topped with gold flake. i mean come on. i felt like the queen of sheba! each bite was a beautiful rich, even slightly sweet (from the sauce) morsel. it felt light and sinful at the same time.\n\nthen, michael stopped by to check on me and suggested i order the <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> robata. two skewers of meaty <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> grilled with a delicious miso sauce. they were the perfect bite to pair with the giant <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark> kernels served on the side. and i ordered mashed purple potatoes to top off the meal. everything was cooked to perfection. i just felt so grateful and happy to be there.\n\nwhen it came time for dessert, i was so full that all i wanted was coffee. so i ordered an espresso with a single scoop of chocolate ice cream, which was a great finish to an amazing meal. then michael and jeremy brought me one more surprise: an ice cream pop. mango ice cream covered with a white chocolate shell and graham cracker.\n\neverything was just awesome. michael and jeremy did a great job, as did my server, also named michael. amazing dinner in a really fun city. beautiful decor. they really made me feel right at home!", 
            "amazing! came here at 8:30 on a wednesday night for my birthday dinner in vegas. i wish i remembered our serves name but he was excellent. super informative on the menu. i ordered a dirty martini and my friend their cucumber cocktail. my martini was perfect but my friends cucumber cocktail was delicious!! due to going out after dinner that night i didn't want to stuff myself so i ordered only the yamato roll and an order of salmon sashimi. i was between the <mark>El Topo</mark> roll and the yamato, my server suggested the yamato even though their <mark>El Topo</mark> is a trademarked roll that has a great following. the yamato roll consists of tuna, <mark>Foie Gras</mark>, <mark><mark>Osetra Caviar Imperial 20g</mark> 20g</mark> gold leaf...it was delicious. best sushi roll i've ever had and further more one of the best things i've had to eat. my friend had another roll i can't recall the name of (consisted of crab and shrimp) but she loved hers as well..and that is coming from someone who's only had a veggie sushi roll one other time and was very skeptical ordering it. for dessert they brought me out a mango ice cream cake pop looking dessert with a candle lit up, on the house!!! so nice of them to do that for my birthday. the manager came over to us and every table to check to see how everything was. without a doubt i will be back here for the great service, amazing food and perfect atmosphere of trendy but not stuffy. thanks for making my birthday dinner great sushisamba!!!"

            "if you're not willing to read the extended version of my review, just know this...\nif you are a true sushi enthusiast, you must go to sushi samba to experience the most phenomenal sushi ever!\n\nmy boyfriend and i got to sushi samba at around 12am on saturday. it was packed with pretty people and the dj was bumpin' the beats! we didn't need a reservation and were seated quickly. if you're like us and willing to splurge on a palate party sensation, then continue on with reading my review.\n\nwe were greeted by our fabulously bubbly (*not in an annoying way*) and knowledgeable server isabella monstrous (she gave me her business card *how cute is that*). she recommended the crispy yellowtail taquitos (they look more like mini tacos really)...man was she spot on! these little tasty tacos were filled with fresh yellowtail pieces that were swimming in spicy aji panca sauce and fresh lime! they were so delish we decided to get a second order. then we continued on our tasting tour with the following dishes that were the highlights of our night (we ordered more than this, but i don't want to write a colossal review):\n\n* <mark><mark>Assortment of Four</mark></mark> - *my favorites!!!\no yellowtail (jalape\\u00f1o and lemon grass)*\no kanpachi (yuzu, sea salt, black truffle oil*)\no tuna (granny smith apple, serrano, lime)*\no salmon (orange and mustard miso)\n\n* <mark>Seared W<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> Beef</mark>* (ponzu gel\\u00e9e, warm japanese mushroom, truffled tofu crema)\no this was my absolute favorite thing of the night!!!! this sauce was amazing over the <mark>Coconut Rice</mark> (flavors were savory, not sweet, coconut flavor was not over powering). the <mark>Seared W<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> Beef</mark> was so buttery and melted in my mouth. \n* rock shrimp (creamy and crispy deliciousness)\n* dessert - samba split\no i cannot even begin to describe how exceptional this dessert was! i was pretty tipsy by the end of our dinner thanks to a 720 bottle of komotsuru sake ($115, but so worth it, fruity, light flavor and gold flakes don't come cheap). all i remember is decadent coconutty and dulce de leche creamy goodness! seriously, when i took my first bite it was like...\"come on, really?\" i wanted to get another. thank goodness for my boyfriend's fatty prevention intervention! good lookin' out my man!\n\noverall we loved this place because the tapas style servings were perfect for a couple who wanted to try a little of everything. their brazilian play on sushi fusion is quite genius and it works! \n\nthe restaurant is bright and beautiful and most importantly the attentive and knowledgeable servers and wait staff make your meal so much more enjoyable! our bill including tip was over $400, but i truly feel like it was worth every penny! my boyfriend and i will definitely be going back to sushi samba the next time we're in vegas!", 
            "i almost want to give this a 5. near oh my god moment, but not quite.\n\nthis is a little misleading. i swear this came up under \"chinese\" on yelp while we were looking for something (in a group <mark><mark>Assortment of Four</mark></mark>) but this is definitely not chinese. it's japanese brazilian fusion, which i had never had, but was awesome. the menu is a bid daunting, but the waitress offered to bring out a tasting menu for us, based on the common questions like, \"are you ok with raw fish,\" \"do you have allergies,\" \"how do you eat red meat,\" etc. this was helpful - usually i'm not fazed by the large menu, but for some reason i was having problems focusing. worth mentioning they say up front that they'll take back anything we don't like, no charge, and they do ask for a budget to keep them in line.\n\nwhat we got was really pretty exceptional. gyoza steamed and pan fried, hamachi taquitos (not what you're thinking - not the deep fried rolls, but little taco shells filled with hamachi sashimi), seared tuna with baby greens and crunchy salt, and portabella fries with kabocha aioli. all sounds fancy, all really good.\n\nthen a warm plate - grilled <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> with a sweet glaze, <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> (not their a5 w<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark>, which we were offered for an upcharge, but declined) and <mark><mark>Alaskan King Crab</mark> Leg</mark>, all with a side of elote. the bass was good - tender and flaky, and i like the glaze. but it was crazy overpowered by the beef and crab. firstly, the beef was far superior to what we had at n9ne. tender, flavorful, and with a great salt and pepper crust on the outside, served with a little pile of powdered chile for dipping. and the crab was that near oh my god moment. an *enormous* <mark><mark>Alaskan King Crab</mark> Leg</mark>, brushed with a sort of thick butter sauce, served piping hot. wow, this was exceptional. and while i guess i should expect it, points to the restaurant for realizing that serving a filet and a <mark><mark>Alaskan King Crab</mark> Leg</mark> family style to diners that have only chopsticks required that you slice things up in to nice little bite sized pieces.\n\nfinally, sushi. their <mark>Neo Tokyo</mark> roll, which is their version of the <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark>, a hamachi roll with spicy crab and avocado on top, a tuna roll with asparagus, dusted with wasabi, and an assortment of sashimi and nigiri. as well as a hot roll - something covered in melted mozzarella, crispy onions and a sweet sauce. all of the cold rolls were good - i especially liked their <mark>Neo Tokyo</mark> roll. the sashimi was also very good, but the hot roll...i could do without. it was in interesting twist - not just the cheese was hot, but the entire roll, rice and all. however, the cheese and a heaping helping of onion and sauce overpowered whatever might have been inside. this was about the only misstep i could find.\n\nthe atmosphere is odd - lots of pounding techno music, along with an odd video collage (on many many video screens) of brazilian beach babes, bullet trains, brazilian slums, and japanese salarymen trudging to their soul-murdering jobs. not sure what they were going for. but whatever.\n\ngreat spot - chinese though it wasn't, we all were appropriately full when it was over (not hungry, no stuffed) and we all agreed we'd be back. the total bill, excluding drinks, was probably about $65 per person. i loved the mix of appetizers, hot beef and seafood, and sushi. if you're going with a group, this is a fun way to try stuff without having to worry about reading a menu.", 
            "this place was awesome! isabella was a phenomenal guide for our party <mark><mark>Assortment of Four</mark></mark> and lead us through a 5 course tasting menu of amazing and diverse flavors, textures, and experiences. this is a 5 star place; it's pricy, so know that going into it, but extraordinary nonetheless!"

            "this place was great. the food was amazing and the service was excellent. very friendly and attentive staff for a vegas restaurant where they know they'll have business.  i had the bobo brazil roll, (which was excellent), the <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> roll and the <mark>Yellowtail Jalapeno</mark>. all the fish was fresh and tasted great. the brazil roll was awesome. another plus is they don't serve blue fin tuna which is becoming extinct from human consumption of course. it's good to know that some restaurants try to help out. an overall great experience at a restaurant.", 
            "maybe it's because i've enjoyed many a meal at the sushi samba locations in nyc, and maybe because i was a little hungover from the previous nights festivities, but i was not overly wowed by lunch here with two of my lady loves with whom i was vacationing. \n\none thing that is always a priority on vacation is food. it has to be, this is a break from the mundane life i leave behind, so why do i want to eat my standard weekly fare of life in the working world? i love sushi and because of it's nutritious nature figured this would be a great way to replenish all things lost to bottomless cocktails and greasy late night foods. i didn't partake in the consumption of any libations at lunch, but did hear that the mojito was pretty stellar.\n\ni ordered the trio <mark>Seaweed Salad</mark> that came beautifully presented on a three trayed dish of hijiki, wakame, and my favorite aka-tosaka. each were lightly dressed with lemon and sidelined with some tomato caviar. not terrible for a $11, but not overly substantial either. for lunch i ordered <mark>Yellowtail Jalapeno</mark> which was ok if not a little heavy on the jalapeno, and a <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> that was all sorts of bland. i think i would have been happier enjoying these as a happy hour because it seems that the prices are a little easier to swallow for the quality of the food. i didn't order anything complex, and maybe they just let the \"easy\" stuff slide, but i wasn't terribly enthused enough to want to go back and give it a second shot to see just how good the rest of the menu is according to the higher ratings given."

            "i was worried about eating at a brand new chain on the strip. i expected to overpay for the quality of food, and get a ton of attitude from the staff. i was pleasantly surprised. \n\nmy friend and i decided to go with the $80 omasake (yes they spell it funny) tasting menu. we asked what was on it, and the waiter said he'd just pick out food around our budget and requests. this seemed odd, but we went with it. we told him we eat everything and to surprise us. i'm trying to remember everything we got, but i'm sure i'm forgetting some things: \n\nedamame/tempura green beans/roasted peppers: wow, one of my fav dishes. everything was salty and delicious, and the sauce that came with it was to die for. get this for $16.. yes.. it sounds pricey, but trust me, just get it. \n\nyellowtail sashimi.. seemed to be in a red pepper preparation? fresh, delicious, and tasty\n\nyellowtail taco.. delicious, but be warned it's messy! \n\nshrimp mango ceviche.. very good, large portion. \n\nsteak and asparagus tempura.. steak was good, but not as jaw dropping as the fish honestly.\n\nsushi rolls: spider roll, <mark>Neo Tokyo</mark>, and i wish i could remember the name of the last one, but it was incredible and had crab meat. i am not a <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> girl.. usually the meat isn't fresh and the sauce is too goopy. this was the most incredible and fresh <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> i've ever had. \n\n\nthe fondue dessert was awesome! very fun and tons of different stuff to dip in. \n\noverall an awesome experience and staff was great.. fresh chopsticks/plates/soy sauce bowls after every couple courses.", 
            "i was really excited about coming here after reading some of these reviews. this is gonna be a long one, please hang in there. \n\nreading about the omakase experiences was what got me interested. i'll spare you the details on the interior. (aunny d. explained it perfectly) the place is just fricken nice, beautifully decorated and the perfect hang out spot. they hired very attractive hostesses that were extremely friendly. the service we received from our waiter and the staff was simply awesome. \n\nnow for the food.....\n\nwe had a party of 5 and our original plan was to order both <mark><mark>Osetra Caviar Imperial 20g</mark> 20g</mark>($100) and the sushi samba omakase ($80). after going through the menu, we decided to order up a variety of items rather than go with the omakase. this way, you end up getting food that would be in the omakase anyway, more food (omakase 7 -course), and for less. \n\n\"small plates\" and \"seviches & tiraditos\"  (<mark>Grade A5</mark> a to f)\n\n<mark>Tuna Tataki</mark>  - (c+) chef overuses tatsoi that practically kills the dish\n\nseared kobe beef -(f) just not worth it. mushrooms overwhelms it\n\nchicharron de calamar - (a) excellent and generous amount!\n\nsashimi seviches - (b) grapefruit juice, jalape\\u00f1o, almond + \npassionfruit,  cucumber, cilantro \n\nsashimi tiraditos - (d) yellowtail jalape\\u00f1o and lemongrass + salmon orange and mustard miso\n\nsushi is obviously the trendy thing to have on a restaurants menu. sushi samba serves up some of the most below average sashimi and sushi. for $33, we had the <mark>Samba Sushi</mark> and sashimi combo. the sashimi was nice and thick.  both salmon and yellowtail were quite good, but the tuna was poorly prepared and lacked any freshness. the sushi was a complete joke. you get a small wafer thin slice of sashimi on a rabbit dropping sized glob of rice. most japanese restaurants, for any combo sushi plate, give you two pieces each - tuna, salmon, and yellowtail. sushi samba gives you one. my whole table thought this was a complete joke and ripoff. it doesnt end here....we ordered 4 different rolls. guess what? they're all puny and only have 4 pieces averaging $10-$20 each. we also ordered the 5 hand roll special ($28) which was okay, but the soy wrap just doesnt work. \n\nnow here's how we felt that the chefs were completely lazy or inexperienced. the sushi rice had no vinegar flavor and that is a must for sushi rice. plus, they used old rice because we had some hard dried pieces in our rolls. overall, i would not waste any money on sushi here. it's a complete insult to customers. \n\nour final dish was the 5 meat churrasco: grilled hanger steak, ribeye, pork tenderloin, chorizo, ling\\u00fci\\u00e7a with malagueta pepper oil and chimichurri.  - this dish was fantastic. the meat, cooked medium, was tender and juicy. (a+)\n\nnow, we had a total of about 16-17 items of various things off the menu. more than double than what you'll get in a omakase.  we had about 5 bottles of japanese beers. our cost  per person was $92 with tax and tip included. (5 people) \n\ni would love to come back just for the atmosphere and the churrasco. its simply a cool place to hang out and drink. dont come here for the japanese food. go to a real japanese restaurant for the omakase. just seeing how the sushi, sashimi, and rolls are prepared makes me question the chef's experience in preparing a true omakase.  \n\nif you actually read this whole thing. thanks!", 
            "waiting for my friends at the bar located near their entrance, i had a good feeling about this place.  it had all the bells and whistles of a nice upscale restaurant with a friendly bartender to start.  unfor<mark>Tuna</mark> my good feeling about this place was short lived as our party was seated.\n\nour reservation was for 9:15 pm sunday night.  we didn't get seated until 9:45 pm despite having our whole party there by 9:00 pm.  i didn't care too much for this considering the place was moderately busy on a holiday weekend, and we weren't on a strict schedule.  so i let this roll easily off my back.\n\nas we were seated, we were greeted by our waiter who was terribly unenthusiastic about his job.  he was considerate about asking  for food allergies.  beyond that, all levels of consideration or customer service for that matter stopped there.  granted, he warned us that our food would come out infrequently, but little did we know it would delay our dinner by over an hour.  a little honesty would have been greatly appreciated.  it took forever for most of our food to come out.  we didn't have utensils or place settings even after our food was delivered.  my friend even asked for the manager, to complain about our horrible service, or lack thereof.  the manager's response was something like: \"things are are a bit backed-up, we'll give you free dessert.\"  now, i don't care how backed-up your kitchen is... that's still no excuse for horrible and incompetent service!  dessert only puts a band-aid on a broken arm... why the hell do restaurant managers  do this?  we are not looking to get something free, we just want to make sure they get their act together... and fast!\n\nour original waiter rarely came to our table after we ordered our food.  another waitress came to our aid who was very helpful and attentive to our needs.  she was very friendly and courteous, it's unfor<mark>Tuna</mark> she wasn't our original waiter because this review would've been completely different.\n\nour unpleasant waiter did the weirdest thing.  as my friend was talking to the manager, being very open about our waiters horrible service, our waiter stood by our table as he refolded all our used napkins, tossing them onto our table.  yes, our used clothe napkins.  who does that?  in front of a party that is pretty disgusted by you no less.  it seemed as if he knew he was already in hot water and didn't give a rats-ass about making up for it.  in addition, he circled the portion of our bill they decided to discount for the unsatisfied service in a stuck-up negative manner.  in hind site, my friend said we should have taken that same pen, in front of our waiter, and scratched out his tip!  of course, we're better than that.\n\nthe food is the only reason why this place is not getting a single star. the food was actually quite good with a variety of <mark>Uni</mark> asian-fusion plates.  i ordered the chicken teriyaki (exotic right?) which was much more than i bargained for.  for such a simple dish, it had a variety of <mark>Uni</mark> flavors with a side of extras that complimented each bite.  my friends ordered an array of food that looked just as good, and was commented on just the same.\n\nfor me, customer service will make or break any experience, no matter how good the food is.  in this case, their service failed horribly.  our party ended up with a waiter that was a few cans short of a six pack regarding personality, who would probably fare better as a chippendale's greeter than a restaurant waiter.  i hope management recognizes this and hires waiters that are actually qualified to interact with human beings.",

            "i agree with the reviews below, they did a great job of explaining the menu in more detail than i could.  gave this place 4 stars for originality of food and drinks, and the atmosphere.  it was not too dark, not too bright, with artsy decor on the walls and different pictures rotating on projection screens (not pg rated, btw, i saw a breast or two flash by, though there were nice scenic pics in there too.)  they have a club/lounge in the back of the restaurant, which was recommended to us by a dior employee at caesars mall, he said it was a mix of hip hop music and some other music, he went on a saturday.  however, we weren't able to go since it's not open on sundays.\n\nme and two other girlfriends of mine went here late on a sunday nite (sat 10 pm?) and there was no wait.  not that this matters, but an added bonus was that our waiter was hot!  hehe.  anyways, the menu had a lot of things that i had never heard of before, so if you're not used to brazilian / peruvian / japanese food then the staff should be able to explain it all to you before you order.\n\nwe ordered the tuna ceviche and shrimp ceviche for appetizers (see reviews below for details of the dishes i talk about here).  both excellent, and fresh, and a decent-sized portion (about a cereal bowl full), but pricey at around $15-17 each.  we also ordered <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> rolls, which were excellent (the tuna practically melted in our mouths) as well as the bobobrazil roll, which mr. hottie waiter recommended - slices of kobe beef atop a roll with a bunch of good stuff in it that i didn't know (sorry to all you food buffs!).  i think it was a mix of onions?  both very good.\n\nas far as cocktails, i would definitely recommend the chu-cucumber cocktail.  i think that's the name of it.  again, mr. hottie waiter recommended this, which i decided to try even though it didn't sound good at first.  it was surprisingly refreshing!  it has some sort of japanese liquor in it, which supposedly had a lite vodka flavor, as well as roseflower and cucumber.  i ended up having two of these (they were in a martini glass), and the third having substituted the original liquor for gin, as a recommendation by the bartender, which had a stronger alcohol taste to it.  one of my friends tried the samba juice cocktail, which she said was good and tasted a little like sangria.\n\noverall, great atmosphere, a bit pricey, but original food that you wouldn't find at your regular sushi restaurant.  i would definitely try this place at least once on a trip to vegas!  hopefully i'll get to check out the lounge next time!", 
            "i agree with an early reviewer that sushi samba is a pretty nice date place.  the first time i went to sushi samba was back in early august, and my date and i tried the calamari appetizer with plantains and that was tasty.  the big hit of the night though were my nina fresa cocktails and the chocolate fondue.  they were absolutely fabulous! the nina fresa cocktails were nice and fruity and gave me a helluva buzz. ;)\n\ni enjoyed the ambiance of sushi samba so much that i went a second time with my girls during labor day weekend and we were seated in the dining area that later transformed into sugarcane boutique lounge after 11 pm.  our sexy latin waiter, jaiver, was very nice and oh-so-hot too! he was very helpful in explaining to us about the different dishes.  for appetizer, we went with <mark>Tuna Tataki</mark> which was melt in your mouth good! then, for entree, we tried the brazilian churrasco, which was very good too, particularly the dipping sauces that went with the meats.  oh yes, we also ordered the cocktail tree which was awesome! all in all, sushi samba was very nice.  i also love the brazilian/latin infused house music that played while we were dining.  i would definitely go back again!", 
            "more of a 3.5...  although i love trendy, high ceiling restaurants that give you a modern feel..sushi samba's decor is a little too cluttered for me. maybe its because of the fact that its a twist between brazilian, japanese, and peruvian cuisine...where they feel like they need to include all three of the cultures art.. but whatever the case may be, theres just.. too much orange swirls, too many funky paintings, and too many weird faces on their walls. i like more of the simple trends. they play trendy music..which is a plus...but they crank it up as if you're in a club which in turn makes everyone talk louder than usual. it's almost as if you're in a convention. \n\n\nsome of the items that i've tried and have a vivid memory of:\n\n-yellowtail sashimi tiradito. tasted like...yellowtail in salsa. it was good..but it was different. i usually like my sashimis in ponzu sauce.\n\n-mushroom toban-yaki is reallllly good. it comes out in a hot sizzling clay pot with like four of five different kinds of mushrooms. \n\n-<mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> taquito\n\n-robata: \n<mark>Filet Mignon</mark>\n<mark>Lamb Chop</mark>\n<mark>Cherry Tomatoes</mark>\nshiitake mushrooms\n\noysters, uni sashimi. \n\noverall, its not too bad. i like the convenience. the two times i've been here was because i stayed at the palazzo. takes like 5 mins to get here from our room.", 
            "good sushi with a twist. they have some <mark>Uni</mark> flavors and rolls: bobo brazil, yamato (<mark>Foie Gras</mark>, caviar, toro) and a few others. <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> was pretty disappointing.\n\ncareful when ordering the kobe, it's $27 an ounce usually a 5oz minimum. my smart friend ordered 10oz's off the bat thinking it was only $27 total. i am not sure of the name, but the kobe cooked on a hot rock is delicious. worth $150 per order? just for the experience. \n\nif you could gamble $50 a hand on blackjack or pai gow, why not eat it as well?  \n\npros: <mark>Uni</mark> rolls and flavors\n\ncons: very pricey ($2 for wasabi haha), mediocre service both times i went", 
            "my friends and i actually couldn't decide on a place to eat and spontaneously came to sushi samba. we weren't too hungry so didn't get a full dinner. i ordered the pork gyozas (and the kabocha pumpkin pure\\u00e9 underneath was a really nice touch). the gyozas were realllly really good, i still think about them. i also ordered the green envy rolls (tuna, salmon, asparagus, wasabi pea crust with a lime mayo) and although it was good, it wasn't as outstanding as the gyozas. unfor<mark>Tuna</mark> i did not yelp before going, so did not get to try out the fruity drinks that everybody's raving about (sad face). i did share the chocolate fondue with a friend, and it came with the chocolate already melted with no heat element under it, so we took it as a sign that we had to eat it quickly. the dipping mediums were: coconut marshmallows, <mark>Steamed Japanese Rice</mark> crispies, passion fruit cake, chocolate brownie, fruits, and green tea ice cream. overall, i really liked the surroundings, i did feel like it matched up to the vegas environment. it was definitely a fun place for dinner before a night out!", 
            "out of all the restaurants i've been to in vegas, i must say....sushi samba is probably the best one i've eaten at!  \n\nthough the food isn't cheap and the portions aren't big.....everything that i ordered was delicious and well worth the money.  i would recommend everything i ordered for those that are going there.  \nhere's what i ordered for 2 people:\n1) <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> and miso antichucos....the <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark> that comes with it was quite tasty\n2) <mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark>....3 fried tofu, 1 asparagus and 1 mushroom in some sort of sauce.  this was probably the most normal item that we ate on the menu....but it was still good.\n3) bobo brazil samba roll.  this was quite interesting...seared kobe beef roll.\n4)  some sort of <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> roll.  the tuna was high quality...very fresh!\n5) peruvian hot chocolate....this was damn good!  the drink was thick and very creamy.\n6) mango honey crisp taquito.  \n\nthinking of the food makes me drool wishing i could have it again.  \nthe service there was excellent!  waiters clean your table and fill your water before you even have to ask.  they were very attentive and not smothering.\n\nbe aware though...right when you sit down they ask you if you'd like some edamame.  you think this would be free....but you will later find out that you're being charged for it.  \n\nsushi samba is a definite must!", 
            "checked out sushi samba for lunch and was impressed. nice atmosphere, although they claim to play samba music and most of what i heard was definitely not samba (marvin gaye?). service was decent, although our server tended to recommend expensive dishes...don't know if those are the ones that are truly their specialties, if management tries to push those dishes, or if our server was just trying to upsell for a bigger tip. robata chicken skewer with <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark> was tasty, the tempura green beans with black truffle aioli were bomb, and the <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> rolls and pacific rolls were very good. i would have liked to see a little more prevalent south american influence, but it's still more <mark>Uni</mark> than your average trendy sushi joint and with good food at reasonable prices.", 
            "this place rocks! located at the palazzo, the place meets vegas expectations- extreme.  the decor was fancy, the waitresses/hostess- hot. here is what i ordered:\n\nmiso encrusted sea-bass robata; duck robata; hamachi jalapeno and lemon grass; <mark>Tuna Tataki</mark>; hamachi ceviche\n\n     of everything, the sea-bass was the best- hands down. probably the best i've ever had.  the waiter happened to recommend the sea-bass over the <mark>Scallop</mark> for taste & portion size. good call on his part, showing me that the staff is educated and willing to make suggestions.  the hamachi and lemon grass was great.  <mark>Tuna Tataki</mark>- was ok, not great, not bad, the hamachi ceviche was tasty as well. \n     friends suggested the peruvian plate- enough for two, but i was too interested in the menu selection to choose otherwise. he did goto sushisamba a bit after me, and ordered it again, so it must be worthwhile.\n     overall it was a great dining experience. i will definitely be back for more. i will probably make this a staple for dining everytime i head back to las vegas.",

            "apryl and i were looking for some sushi. we had made our way to the canal shoppes at the venetian and were browsing the directory for sushi places when we were approached by an employee. we told him what we were looking for and he quickly suggested <mark>Samba Sushi</mark>, adding that \"it's the best sushi on the strip!\"... \n\nafter walking nearly a mile, we found sushi samba. the decor looked interesting and it had a great vibe. \n\nwe each ordered a special roll and split another <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> roll. after waiting 20 minutes, three small, thin, very weird looking rolls arrived to our table. \n\ni will spare you the details of how apryl and i managed to get these things down, but it was not easy. hands down, the worst sushi i've ever had the trouble of putting in my mouth. the idea and creativity of the roll sounds better on the menu than it looks, and far better than it actually tastes. flavorless and lacking any kind of texture. \n\nsave yourself $50... buy a can of tuna and leave it in your hotel room for a day or two... it'll taste the same.",

            "we got there around 6:30pm just in time for happy hour and the bar was still pretty packed. we waited a couple of minutes till there were 2 seats available. we really shouldn't have bothered to wait...\nwe asked the bartender for happy hour menus and then we ordered a mojito and a caipirinha. my friend loves mojitos, i don't care for them. he said these were the worse he's ever had. the mojito was slightly better than the caipirinha, but not by much. it practically tasted the same. we also ordered the berry smash and the samba juice which actually looked and tasted quite similar except that the berry smash has no alcohol! none of these drinks were very strong, nor tasted good. for around $12-$15 a drink, it really should've be made by a professional. we went to craftsteak the night before and the drinks there were fantastic. the bartenders @ sushi samba are pretty, but they don't know how to make a decent cocktail. however, it's not all their fault since they were using mostly mixers and not premium alcohol/fresh ingredients unlike other upscale bars/restaurants. \n\nwe also had some apps with our drinks. \napps: <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> roll, yellowtail seviche and crispy yellowtail taquitos. \n\nfor a friday night, their sushi was clearly not very fresh. the <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> was okay, the spicy sauce that was placed on top instead of mixed with the tuna hid whatever flavor the tuna had. i didn't like the yellowtail seviche, but my friend thought it was okay. i thought it was too bitter from the lime. the worse thing out of this whole experience were the yellowtail taquitos. the fish tasted spoiled. my friend was sick all night. it could've been the ridiculous amount of alcohol we consumed that night since we went to dos caminos later that night, but my friend says it was definitely the yellowtail taquitos... the drinks at dos caminos are so much better than sushi samba's... the mojitos are strong and freshly made and the glasses are 2x the size :p",

            "came here on the reccomendation with chef micheal cressoti and i was impressed. it's located at the top floor of the palazzo with a hip and dark ambiance. okay people it's dark crowded and loud. do you forget where you are?!? it's las vegas people!! this is what you should expect. this is the new era where sushi is supposed to be hip. i took my girfriend and a third wheel there for a dinner and pretty much ordered the omakase. as a person who worked around in sushi restaraunts, lived in peru, and surrounded by brazileros, i still was taught i had alot more to learn about the cuisine and the complex flavors on the palate when mixed together. honestly unless you're ordering the kobe beef roll or the fuie gras sushi... skip the whole sushi list. the rolls are great but for the price, i would opt out for the kitchen orders. <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> was a little different but nothing to make you stand up and dance. the red miso <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> (i believe that was the fish) skewers are to die for. the grill is special grill where they use woodchips brought in from japan. this is the kind of special treatment the chefs use to creats such dishes, so the price is reasonable. all their fish is line caught so for the environmentally conscience, expect to pay more for sushi as opposed to other sushi restaraunts. their ceviche was very light and refreshing, so was the yellowtail sashimi and the ceviche. the kobe beef tacos. sorry kogi was okay for me. asian tacos are as good as it gets, but kobe beef tacos who can possibly resist. it was spectacular with the spicy emulsion that was served on the side. the duck confit with wil mushroom is a must order. succulent morsels of variety of mushrooms and the perfectly cooked medium rare breast of duck just melted in your mouth. the sake sommelier was very friendly and knew her alcohol, so if you are interested in ordering sake ask for the pro. from here and there, after 5 other dishes, we ended up with dessert. the chocolate cake, which they said was great, was rather just good, but the carrot cake. i hate carrot cake, but the pastry chef, she whippped up something so magical and delicious. not too sweet, not too heavy, not too bready... if you can understand what i mean, you will love this cake. in a cake, i look for the perfect balance of sweetness and richness, that will just top off your great meal. not to overwhelm your palate and your stomach but make a nice closure to the expensive meal you just enjoyed. it was the best carrot cake i've had. overall the staff was friendly and the general manager was kind enough to explain to me about the food and the kitchen, since i work in the kitchen as well. i left there extremely happy and with an impressed gf and third wheel. thank you sushi samba.", 
            "what is there not to love about brazilians?\n\nbrazilian bbq, brazilian wax, brazilian models, and brazilian fusion.\n\nsushi samba is ahhh-mazing. i honestly thought the bf was overhyping the place and thought it would be mediocre, but i was surprised by the quality of the food and how delicious everything was!\n\nour waitress regina was nice and very bubbly. she made our dining experience at sushi samba great. instead of ordering random items off the menu, we chose the personalized prix fixe menu. basically, you tell your waiter/waitress what you like/dislike and the price limit per person and they basically bring out items that they think you would like.  if you don't like it, the waiter/waitress takes full responsibility for it and doesn't charge you. \n\nbetween the 3 of us, we had:\n- edamame: i'm not a fan of edamame so i rarely eat it and don't really care for it.\n- yellowtail crispy taquitos: this is a cold dish and it's like a sushi taco. the taquito had lemongrass, avocado, and aji panca miso. definitely recommend it!\n- <mark>Tuna Tataki</mark>: also another cold dish. very light and it had white asparagus, heart of palm, avocado, tatsoi, and citrus soy. i love anything with tuna in it so i enjoyed this a lot. \n- mushroom toban yaki w/ <mark>Filet Mignon</mark>: omg delicious! this came in a stone pot and had a bunch of <mark>Mixed <mark>Wild Mushrooms</mark></mark> and <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> in a delicious broth. \n- sashimi tiradito (yellowtail, kanpachi, tuna, and salmon): i didn't care too much for this dish. it was good but some of the sauce that accompanied the sashimi didn't blow me away. the yellowtail had a jalapeno and lemongrass sauce, the kanpachi had a yuzu, black truffle oil, and sea salt sauce, the tuna had a yuzu soy, hickory oil, and toasted garlic sauce, and the salmon had a maiz cancha, lime zest, and ponzu sauce. \n- <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> w/ a side of <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark>: this had to be one of the best <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> i've ever had in my life. it was cooked perfectly and had the perfect buttery, melt in your mouth texture. it was also marinated in a sweet sauce, but it wasn't too overpowering. the side of corn complemented the <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> very well.\n- <mark>Neo Tokyo</mark> roll, carnival roll, <mark>El Topo</mark> roll - i'm not the biggest fan of rolls and these rolls were a bit disappointing. especially since it came out last after all the really delicious dishes. i tried each of the rolls, but they weren't memorable.\n- carrot cake: oooooommmmmmmgggggggg! best carrot cake, ever. it was served with brown butter ice cream, cinnamon cream, rainbow carrot chip, and orange reduction. i seriously wanted to lick the plate after i was done!\n\nthe total per person (not including alcohol, tip, or tax) was about $65/per person. totally worth it! \n\nif you ever decide to try sushi samba, skip the rolls and go for the good stuff! i definitely recommend the personalized prix fixe menu.", 
            "wish i could give this place a 5 because the food is delicious, but unfor<mark>Tuna</mark> because of the lousy service i have to give it 3 stars. went to this restaurant with a few girlfriends on a trip to vegas. super excited to enjoy a great sushi meal with people that love sushi. instead we were greeted by a server, name to be disclosed, who was degrading, rude, and treated us like cheap girls. \n\none of our friends requested for a carafe of hot sake and this server immediately said that this restaurant was too high class to have any sort of hot sake. who was this guy? how does he not know that we're just girls who enjoy drinking hot sake from time to time-this server needs to learn some major restaurant etiquette! as the night progressed, the service did not get any better. i've been to many wonderful restaurants in vegas where the food was great and the service even better and this restaurant definitely put the standard of vegas restaurants in the low range. for<mark>Tuna</mark> the manager hooked my friends and i with some shots that were delicious - one of them included cucumber and was fresh and cool to the taste. \n\non the positive note, the food was ridiculously delicious (hoping there wasn't any extra protein hidden in it). the sashimi dishes with granny apple sauce and another with some sort of lemon grass sauce was soo good! the chilean <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> was delectable and probably the best dish on the menu. \n\ni always believe that las vegas has the best places to eat, this restaurant may be one of them, but i will never go there again unless i confirm that this server is not serving my table. and if anyone from this restaurant is reading this...never underestimate your customers!",

            "first impression as you walk in -- who turned out the lights? the restaurant is very dark which seems to be a general theme in vegas. but even for vegas, this was club dark (and loud as well) and hardly appropriate for a restaurant in my opinion.\n\nwe let the server order for us -- we had a large group and trusted the server to make some of the better recommendations, cost no object. the ingredient quality seemed, overall, above average with the exception of what appeared to be farmed salmon. farmed salmon is not preferred even when cooked, let alone as sushi. other fish selections, for<mark>Tuna</mark>, seemed better -- not exceptional, but better than average. but in an absolute sense, the fish quality and selection was definitely not on par with the outrageous pricing that seems so ubiquitous in the palazzo.\n\nbefore i go on, i have to mention that service was impeccable.\n\nthe most disagreeable aspect of this dinner was that, even if high quality fish was being used, you couldn't tell given that it was all served fraken-sushi style. everything was drowning in some sort of sauce and/or combined with other mismatched ingredient so that the finished product is something only frankenstein's monster would find palatable. motainai -- what a waste of fresh fish -- this completely misses the point of sushi / sashimi.\n\nthe good: i didn't order any wine, but they seemed to have a large selection of sake -- from various 'appellations' and a good representation of amakuchi to karakuchi. some well known, some more esoteric. but it seemed like a pretty good list, especially for the us, in a quick scan (again, in the dark).\n\ni would venture back for sake sampling (assuming that they have a good selection by the glass, not just by the bottle). but i wouldn't go back for the franken-sushi. (you may ask why i went in the first place -- i was actually interested in brazilian food for dinner; i misunderstood the theme of the restaurant as there were no brazilian food offerings).",

            "my friends and i came here for happy hour.  \n\nthere wasn't much room at the bar, but i found a single table in the bar.  i asked the hostess if we could sit there and she said yes but we had to order from the bar. i asked the hostess for menus and after she told me i had to order from the bar she said someone would be there to help me. errr...ok? my friend didn't hear any of this, but the bartender was nice and said instead of having us go up to the bar, she would have a waiter serve us.  the waiter who came was also really nice.\n\ni ordered a veggie tempura and <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> roll. the veggie tempura roll was one of the bigger dishes there and was pretty good. it came with a <mark><mark>Osetra Caviar Imperial 20g</mark> 20g</mark> and a creamy tangy sauce.  the <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> roll had really weird rice.  it was smashed together and wasn't sushi rice.  i'm not sure that it was even <mark>Steamed Japanese Rice</mark>.  i know this is a fusion restaurant but please don't f up sushi rice! \n\n3 stars might seem a little harsh for bad rice, but as a whole, i guess i just wasn't that impressed.  it wasn't bad, but it was def. a'ight.", 
            "i have been here twice. the first time i ate here and the second i just had drinks. the food was really good. unfor<mark>Tuna</mark> it was almost three years ago so i don't remember what i ate. sorry yelpers, i know that isn't very helpful. i do remember being very satisfied though. very fresh and full of wonderful flavors. \n\nthe second time i just had a couple drinks at the bar. i had a mojito which was really good and then i had chu cucumber. nice, very refreshing. \n\nall in all its a good place to come if your staying at the palazzo/venetian. at night they get really busy so make reservations. i can't wait to go back and eat more so i can update my review with more useful information.", 
            "my wife and i really liked sushi samba and their fushion menu.  we were running late for a show and couldn't wait to be seated in the main restaurant so we sat at the bar at the edge of the restaurant and the mall area as soon as something opened up.  lara s was our main waitress plus another girl and she was very friendly and helpful in selecting our drinks and menu items.  my wife and i are big st. germaine liquor fans and we loved the \"chu-cumber\" drink.  also thought the tempura green bean appetizer with truffle aioli sauce was yummie.  we had a sampling of sushi and pacific, <mark>El Topo</mark>, and <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> rolls and all was very good.", 
            "this was our go to late night place while staying at the venetian. we opted to sit at the bar and try their happy hour specials along with a few things off their menu.\n\ni woud highly recommend the miso chilean <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>, as it was once of the best i have ever had. the vegetables that came with it were so tender and delicious, even though i hate brussels sprouts, the rest were quite good.\n\nthe <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> rolls were really good also, though small compared to other places i've had them.\n\nthe best vegetable dish i've had in a long time were the collard greens in an asian dressing. they were crunchy and filling enough for two. though, next time i'm not sharing! \n\nanother stand out to me were the fried plantains. normally, restaurants cut them thick and serve them with sides of beans and sour cream. i loved that these were cut thin and lightly breaded, deep fried and sprinkled only with some shavings of cheese. \n\nbesides the <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>, the items we got were only $5-6 bucks a dish and easily can be split by two. this was probably my favorite place to dine while there and probably one of the better late night dining options you have if you don't feel like burgers or sandwiches.\n\ni would have loved to give them a full 5 stars but the bar people were much to slow in not only forgetting to ask our order but forgetting to bring us our drinks after having to ask  three times, while serving those who just sat down right away. otherwise, the food was fantastic!", 
            "date/time:  monday - 10pm\noccasion:  vegasaversary dinner after phantom \nparty of:  two\nlocation:  amongst the shoppes in palazzo.  interesting decor.  dark ambiance.\nordered:  roasted shishito peppers, hamachi tiradito, miso-glazed <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> skewers, <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> roll, <mark>Moqueca Mista</mark>, and trio of sorbet/ice cream (green tea, lychee, and vanilla)\ntotal incl gratuity: ~$110\n\ni am so stunned that sushi samba (ss) has an overall rating of 3.5!  it definitely deserved a 5 in my book.  was pretty blown away by all of their food.  i'm not usually that impressed with asian fusion but they deserve two thumbs up.  we arrived at 10pm and i was expecting it to be rather dead but it was still busy and happening.  all tables occupied, loud music bumping, and servers running around.\n\nthe bf and i decided on a few dishes to share.  everything on the menu ranged between $10 - $30.  granted we ordered a number of different items - for variety and sufficiency - we figured our dinner bill would be a little pricey.  seeing shisito peppers on the menu, i had to go for it.  i don't know what it is about these little things but i love them.  ss serves them grilled with a splash of lemon and seasalt.  a very good and light starter.  it actually went really well with the lemongrass sauce that was served with the hamachi tiradito.  don't even get me started on that lemongrass sauce. o.m.gee. i'm pretty sure there was a hint of crack in that thing because i was drinking that stuff.  it was so incredibly delicious.  when the waitress tried to take my plate away, she noticed how much i was savoring each drip of it so she brought me out a ramekin of it.  naturally i was dipping everything in that sauce.\n\nthe <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> skewers were just as delectable - melted in my mouth with the perfect flavor of miso.  highly recommend!  we noticed our neighbor ordered the <mark>Moqueca Mista</mark>. it looked delicious and we opted for it as well.  it was the perfect entree.  i couldn't have been more pleased.  the seafood was fresh and generous in portion.  the coconut lime flavor was delicious.\n\nseriously, ss is fantastic  i can't emphasize it enough.  since i've been back home, i've been telling everyone about this place. no joke!  one can only hope that they'll open one in sf.  i'm headed back to vegas in a week - making my way back there for sure!", 
            "we were promised a \"dining experience\", and that's what we got!\n\na group of 6 of us came here, and we were instantly charmed by our server, michael. he recommended a custom \"dining experience\" for about $50-60 per person, based on our likes and dislikes. food just kept coming out and we had no idea what to expect, but michael really hit the nail on the head with everything he picked for us.\n\nsome of the highlights:\n\n- yellowtail tacos\n- yellowtail in lemongrass sauce\n- <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> (i don't eat <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>, but my friends were raving about it!). the <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark> that came with it was excellent \n- some kind of steak, cooked medium rare served with rice and beans\n- a sushi platter with <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark>, california, and <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark> rolls\n\nsushisamba is really great for groups, and since you can customize a meal based on your budget, it can be relatively affordable, too. and every dish was amazing! i definitely recommend it, and hope to try brunch at one of their nyc locations.", 
            "we were in vegas this past weekend and decided to check out sushi samba.  we did the tasting \"omakase\" menu and it was a hit with everyone on the table.  we got a nice sampling of everything there, it was all superb.  my favorite were the yellowtail tacos, yumm!  most of all, we had a really great waitress, unfor<mark>Tuna</mark> i can't remember her name but she was very well informed and on top of it and she's the reason i'm giving this place 5 stars.", 
            "came late night, super hungry after drinking and dancing. they have a happy hour menu late night i think between 11pm-2am $5 dollar mojitos, $5 caipirinha- which were amazing, they taste just like one straight from brazil. they also have <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> rolls and other rolls for $5 each. the vibe and atmosphere is great. bartender was very friendly and helpful.", 
            "this restaurant caught my eye because it was something out of the ordinary from your typical sushi restaurant. the menu offered an intriguing variety but when i began reading the reviews i knew i had to try it. i would suggest anyone going there for the first time to try the dining experience because you may think you know what you want but the chef knows better! the server asks if there is anything you do not like or if you have any food allergies and then how much money per person you're looking to spend. there are options anywhere from $50 per person to $130 per person if kobe beef if something that interests you. as it was for a special occasion we opted for $80 per person and even though thats more than i have probably ever spent on a single meal there were no regrets.\n\ncourse #1 consisted of berkshire pork gyoza which is basically pork dumplings in a pumpkin puree and yellowtail ceviche taquitos, both of which were absolutely delicious and not necessarily something i would have ordered on my own.\n\ncourse #2 was yellowtail sashimi in a spicy peruvian sauce with a slice of red jalapeno on top and octopus sashimi in a japanese citrus sauce which again were both to die for!\n\ncourse #3 had an array of <mark>Filet Mignon</mark>, <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>, <mark>Alaskan King Crab</mark> and <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark>. all were moist and tender but the <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> absolutely melted in your mouth! <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark> was a yummy alternative to <mark><mark>Osetra Caviar Imperial 20g</mark> 20g</mark> as well.\n\nfinally, course #4 was the main sushi dinner. <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark> rolls were delicious, but the <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> with i believe tuna on top was absolutely amazing! there was also <mark>Half Maine Lobster</mark> and another roll which i believe had lobster in it as well and was probably the only thing of the entire dinner that i was not absolutely amazed with, but it was still good!\n\nanother great thing about this place is they tell you if there is anything throughout this meal you do not like they will take it back and bring you something else! as our server said, \"its like a money back guarantee!\"\n\nanyways this is definitely a place i would tell everyone who loves trying new things to try or even just the sushi lover. do it! it will not disappoint!\n\nonly part i would complain about is the fact that there is not one in california!!!", 
            "amazing sushi and interesting cocktails!  staff was friendly and prompt, atmosphere very fun.  order the <mark>Tuna Tataki</mark>!  some of the best sushi i've ever had.  will definitely be returning next time i'm in vegas.", 
            "i had a quick dinner with some work colleagues at sushi samba the night we arrived at the hotel. the wait on a sunday night was about 45 minutes ... so we asked if we could sit/eat at the bar. they said it was fine and were promptly seated.\n\nwe ordered 3 sushi rolls and 1 entree along with a couple of beers and one cocktail. for three people our bill was well over $100 and we didn't really have that much to eat. the service at the bar was friendly, but unattentive ... they seemed more interested in talking with each other than the customers that night. it was good, but i can't see paying $14+ for \"specialty\" rolls and $8-9 for a standard <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> roll that you can get at a very good sushi restaurant for $5-6 anywhere other than on the strip in vegas. i know ... it's vegas, everything is expensive ... but $100 for a few rolls and an entree is a bit excessive.", 
            "the experience was different and i absolutely adored the service, the food and the presentation of this place.  it's a happening place for peru/japanaese cuisine.  waiters were quick to respond and checked on us at the right times.  water was always filled and food was delicious!\n\nfirst off, yamato roll....fatty tuna with <mark>Foie Gras</mark> and cavier with good flecks?  heck yah!  how much more delicious can you get with this roll?  the green envy roll, and the bobo brazil were always very good!  the <mark>Tuna Tataki</mark> was also amazing.  \n\nfor my birthday, they gave us a shot tree the bartender concocted for us.  also another great drink was this drink with jalopengo in it.  i don't remember the name, but it was a nice kick!  :)  yummmm!  i can't wait to come back again!  thanks sushisamba waiters and bartenders!", 
            "excellent service, good quality, fresh sashimi, and questionable serving size. \n\nwhen my chirashi was delivered, it looked strangly small.  while i was eating my meal, i realized that the cuts of sashimi were very thin and small.  unusually so.  i was sitting at the sushi bar and there was a guy sitting a couple of seats away from me.  after i was done with my meal, he asked me what i thought of it.  i said that i enjoyed it, but did mention the sashimi size concern i had.  he replied, saying that was his experience as well.  my grandmother used to say.....'if enough people say it, its got to be true'.  grandma ethel was a smart cookie.\n\nit's unfor<mark>Tuna</mark> as this impacted an otherwise nice dining experience.",

            "i want to like this place so much.  the food that we got was delicious (the <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> skewers are amazingly soft and flaky, and the black truffle sauce that comes with the fried green beans is tdf), but the service we got was horrible.  our server was fine--she was upbeat and tried to work with our wants, but whomever it was that also talked to us was horrible.  \n\nto be fair, we were a large group (about 14 or 15), and understandably it is hard to accommodate such a large group, let alone trying to get our food out at the same time.  honestly, i could care less if my food came out at the same time as the people i had been sitting with.  before we could even look at the menus to see what was available a la carte, the restaurant pushed us into this 'tasting menu' that would \"incorporate our tastes as well as some of their classic dishes\"--sounds fine, but in a group of 14 or 15 people who have very varied tastes, that is almost impossible to do.  to begin with, some of our group members didn't eat any raw fish, and others were basically only interested in raw fish.  we eventually agreed to this tasting menu just out of an unwillingness to continue \"fighting\".  they tried to appease by sending us some shooters and edamame, grilled shishito peppers, and fried green beans to start.  great, and thanks, but still not the best service you could ask for at a restaurant like here. \n\nif this rating were about the food only, i would give it 5 stars.  the food really is delicious, and the decor (while strange) goes well with the feel that the restaurant seems to be going for.  the pork in our meat sampler platter was overdone and dry, but two types of beefs that were perfectly cooked made up for it.  the appetizer of some sort of spicy tempura rock shrimp salad was moist with the perfect amount of chewiness and spring; it's spicy, but not in the give-me-milk-to-guzzle-now way.  the sushi that we were served, however, was pretty sub-standard.  i'm sure this was because it had to fall in line with our tasting menu price point (which somehow got haggled down); honestly, i did not come to sushisamba just to get <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> rolls.. i could get that anywhere. \n\nin short, come here if you're in a small group.  the food really is worth it, many times over.  i'm sure it will be a far more amazing trip than the one i had in a large group.", 
            "i came here on a saturday night for dinner to celebrate my 25th birthday with the best of company, fun entertainment, and delicious food!!! i'd been here before but always sat in the front of the restaurant... had no clue how huge this place was!!! we sat in the very back (where it seems many of the large birthday parties were seated) the ambiance of the restaurant is very dark and jungle esque (if i remember correctly o.o) lol very ruckusy and vegas appropriate! there were drummers and scandalous (but h0t) dancers going up and down the aisles which provided for the fun entertainment.  but enough of that, on to the main event. \n\nwe had a party of 6 and decided it best to do as our super nice server suggested, omakase style :) \n- cucumber cocktail on the house!!! they brought each of us a mini cocktail to start the meal off! very nice and considerate of them! nice and refreshing and definitely got my appetite going :) \n- a trio appetizer platter consisting of well salted edamame, roasted shito peppers, and deep fried string beans served in the most delicious chipotle aoli sauce (all 3 were delicious but i think my favorite would have to be the roasted shito peppers with a drizzle of lime juice for a nice kick)\n- yellowtail sashimi mini tacos!!! these were sooo fun and delicious! great fushion idea! the restaurant is very accommodating, we mentioned to them 1 of the girls is allergic to cilantro so they brought out a special lobster taco for just for her! the flavors were bold and the taco shell was nice and crispy.  but i think i still enjoy dos camino's mini tacos better...those are to.die.for.  \n- ahi tuna over a piece of bamboo and basil leaf.  this was an interesting combination.  probably my least favorite dish of the night.  the basil leaf was a bit overwhelming and covered the taste of the ahi too much. \n- <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> with oversized asparagus.  the meat was tender and very well cooked, very pink in the middle.  i'm not a big beef eater so i only ate the edges of the piece but my friends seemed to enjoy it.  definitely not one of the top dishes of the night but was still yummy.  the asparagus however, was quite delicious!! they probably cooked it in butter... hahaha i'll take it :) a good bite on the outside and nice and tender on the inside! \n- <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> with oversized <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark>!!! yummmy!!!! the <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> was nice and flaky.  flavoring was a bit salty but i feel like at these restaurants they tend to do that a bit...i mean, everyones a bit intoxicated so salty foods are what people want lol the <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark> was just really fun to eat!! my friends really enjoyed it but i definitely like summer sweet white corn on the cob better :) \n- mushroom pot on crack. this was definitely the show stopper of the night!!! the flavoring of the sauce, the textures of the 3? 4? different mushrooms. happiness. the sauce was like a cream of mushroom, milky, full flavored, salty, a hint of sweetness... too good. needless to say we all took a bite and just smiled in satisfaction. we all stared at each other and knew rice was needed to soak up all that bomb sauce!! \n- 4 different sushi rolls were brought out last (3.5 stars).  all 4 were decent, nothing really to rave much about unfor<mark>Tuna</mark>. :(  i'm a big big sushi lover and have had some off the chart rolls so i can't pretend these were anything to die for.  \n\n***the first time i came my friend ordered for the table and i definitely think that made a difference.  they have some really scrumptious dishes that i wish i could've ordered for my friends to try!! perhaps next time!! i'll be more prepared lol \n\noverall ratings:\nfood - 3.75 stars (except for the mushroom pot on crack... 4.5 stars for that)\nfood (for the first time i came) - 4.25 stars! \ndrink - 4 stars for the cucumber cocktail & bottle of santa margaritta pino grigio\npresentation - 4 stars\nservice & ambiance - 4 stars\n\ni gave this place 4 stars mainly because i had a great time that night, and the company i kept definitely played a big part in that.  the food is goood, just a bit $$$$.  its definitely a great place to go with a group thats just looking for some good eats, good drinks, and a great time :o) bottom line: i'd definitely go back again!!",

            "their signature roll saved them from a 2 star review.  reading the reviews and consistency of solid reviews, i thought i found the spot!  once there, the overpriced menu and sake list reminded me i was in vegas, a place that should not have to be this expensive, i mean come on, people are handing money hand over fist at the tables, don't gouge us at the restaurants.  nigiri was priced per piece at a rate higher than i'm used to paying for 2 pieces.  the rolls were decent, i liked the <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> version they served, a little <mark>Uni</mark>, the eel avocado was good.  my main complaint is that they are a decent sushi spot, nothing extraordinary, and their prices are simply too high.  however, the samba roll, with <mark>Half Maine Lobster</mark>, mango and some other delightful flavors that created a party on my palate, bumped them to 3 stars.  great roll, $19, but that one was special.", 
            "i almost want to give this a 5. near oh my god moment, but not quite.\n\nthis is a little misleading. i swear this came up under \"chinese\" on yelp while we were looking for something (in a group <mark><mark>Assortment of Four</mark></mark>) but this is definitely not chinese. it's japanese brazilian fusion, which i had never had, but was awesome. the menu is a bid daunting, but the waitress offered to bring out a tasting menu for us, based on the common questions like, \"are you ok with raw fish,\" \"do you have allergies,\" \"how do you eat red meat,\" etc. this was helpful - usually i'm not fazed by the large menu, but for some reason i was having problems focusing. worth mentioning they say up front that they'll take back anything we don't like, no charge, and they do ask for a budget to keep them in line.\n\nwhat we got was really pretty exceptional. gyoza steamed and pan fried, hamachi taquitos (not what you're thinking - not the deep fried rolls, but little taco shells filled with hamachi sashimi), seared tuna with baby greens and crunchy salt, and portabella fries with kabocha aioli. all sounds fancy, all really good.\n\nthen a warm plate - grilled <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> with a sweet glaze, <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> (not their a5 w<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark>, which we were offered for an upcharge, but declined) and <mark><mark>Alaskan King Crab</mark> Leg</mark>, all with a side of elote. the bass was good - tender and flaky, and i like the glaze. but it was crazy overpowered by the beef and crab. firstly, the beef was far superior to what we had at n9ne. tender, flavorful, and with a great salt and pepper crust on the outside, served with a little pile of powdered chile for dipping. and the crab was that near oh my god moment. an *enormous* <mark><mark>Alaskan King Crab</mark> Leg</mark>, brushed with a sort of thick butter sauce, served piping hot. wow, this was exceptional. and while i guess i should expect it, points to the restaurant for realizing that serving a filet and a <mark><mark>Alaskan King Crab</mark> Leg</mark> family style to diners that have only chopsticks required that you slice things up in to nice little bite sized pieces.\n\nfinally, sushi. their <mark>Neo Tokyo</mark> roll, which is their version of the <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark>, a hamachi roll with spicy crab and avocado on top, a tuna roll with asparagus, dusted with wasabi, and an assortment of sashimi and nigiri. as well as a hot roll - something covered in melted mozzarella, crispy onions and a sweet sauce. all of the cold rolls were good - i especially liked their <mark>Neo Tokyo</mark> roll. the sashimi was also very good, but the hot roll...i could do without. it was in interesting twist - not just the cheese was hot, but the entire roll, rice and all. however, the cheese and a heaping helping of onion and sauce overpowered whatever might have been inside. this was about the only misstep i could find.\n\nthe atmosphere is odd - lots of pounding techno music, along with an odd video collage (on many many video screens) of brazilian beach babes, bullet trains, brazilian slums, and japanese salarymen trudging to their soul-murdering jobs. not sure what they were going for. but whatever.\n\ngreat spot - chinese though it wasn't, we all were appropriately full when it was over (not hungry, no stuffed) and we all agreed we'd be back. the total bill, excluding drinks, was probably about $65 per person. i loved the mix of appetizers, hot beef and seafood, and sushi. if you're going with a group, this is a fun way to try stuff without having to worry about reading a menu.", 
            "the sushi was good, not great, just good.  unfor<mark>Tuna</mark>, i've paid a lot less for much better.  3 stars because this restaurant is clever with menu items and decor, but nestled in the heart of a massive casino full of tourists and prices to boot. this place kind of reminds me of a jefferson airplane video, dark, yet colorful.  the wait staff were very friendly, but inattentive for an early dinner service.", 
            "i wanted to do happy hour before a night of binge drinking so i decided to make reservations at sushi samba for me and my 5 girlfriends. on the reservations site i was told that happy hour was served throughout the restaurant which sounded perfect because we had a big party and we all know how crowded the bar area can get. however, once we arrived, we were told it was at the bar area only. whomp. the bar area is super small but we managed to snag a little table and squeeze all of our bodies around it. not the most comfortable seating, but it'll have to do.\n\nwe ordered everything on their happy hour menu. all the dishes were about $5 and we wanted to try everything. unfor<mark>Tuna</mark> our waitress came back 3 times just to tell us that they \"no longer had this item on their happy hour menu\". bogus! i asked why and she told me that their menu is ever changing and since we came on the last day of the month, \"they ran out of ingredients\". really?!  so instead of eating, we decided to just drink and ate whatever few things they did have on happy hour. we ordered some rolls off their regular menu and they were all lacking. a $16 roll with only 4 pieces? kind of ridiculous, wouldn't you agree? and it wasn't even all that. we left hungry and disappointed. luckily we were buzzed so we got over it rather quickly.",

            "wandered in here without a plan for a first time meet up.\n\nthough my eyes were not necessarily on the food, i noted a few things, sitting at a table vs. sitting at the sushi bar: the emphasis was on the fusion foods (sushi menu was backpage) and the drink menu was bigger than the food menu. i agree with bunny g. that no one bothered to explain anything about the menus.\n\nordered their house ice tea which is a mint tea arnold palmer, served with lemon & lime wedges.  very tasty & refreshing since i don't think i've ever had an arnie with mint tea.\n\nthe edamame was standard fare, served cool with crushed rock salt sprinkled on top.  i ordered 2 rolls, <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark> (6 pcs), and a <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> (8 pcs).  the <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark> was exactly that, no fuss, frills, standouts.  the <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark>, i think was just a tuna roll served with a squirt of sriracha.  good thing i wasn't there for the food!\n\nthe decor & service were exceptional and it looked like there was a special/private dining area in the back.  interesting decor that isn't particular of any single culture, or at least any that i know of.  there were these wooden chairs that looked to be carved out of giant coconuts but could really only seat an ommpa loompa.  another strange touch, that doesn't quite work to me: the food menus were not on the small side, but the cover was like leather, as in, not self supporting.  the only way to read the menu, that didn't feel awkward, was to lay it on the table.  for some reason, i didn't want a leather menu touching my little appetizer plate.  it seems unsanitary.\n\nbecause the prices were so high, i rate the food a 2-2.5 stars, but the decor & service a solid 4 stars.  so, 3.33 stars, it is!",

            "my girlfriend and i stayed at the venetian and came here after watching cirque du soliel: zarkana at aria on 05-11-14. i found this restaurant on yelp before we came. i absolutely love sushi and she hates it. we both love texas de brazil so i figured a good compromise would be a churrascaria crossed with a sushi bar so we picked sushi samba. i always like to find the most expensive roll at sushi bars and try it so i picked the s\\u00c3o paulo for $24. it had <mark>Scallop</mark>, masago, red onion, tuna, salmon, shrimp, yellowtail, avocado, truffle, hacho miso soy, chive oil inside. to be honest the red onion over powered the flavor of every other ingredient and kind of ruined it for me. this is coming from someone that loves onions too. if i come back i'll probably ask them to cut that out when i order. i also ordered a generic <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> roll. for our two sharable sides we ordered <mark>Purple Potato Mash</mark> and <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark>. the two sides were the best thing at this restaurant. the <mark>Purple Potato Mash</mark> had a rich buttery taste and creamy texture that melted in my mouth. the <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark> had a perfect amount of sweetness and the texture was lightly firm just the way i like. the real downside of the meal though is that my girlfriend decided to order the <mark>Berkshire Pork Belly</mark> rather than the <mark>Lamb Chop</mark> she was thinking about. i asked if she was sure she wanted that and she said yes. i neglected to mention to her that <mark>Berkshire Pork Belly</mark> is literally a seared section of fat. she was not pleased, but didn't want to order anything else when her food arrived. my girlfriend was actually quite content with the <mark>Purple Potato Mash</mark> and <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark>. overall the experience was pretty good except for the group of 3 drunk russian speaking call girls (assuming) seated next to us that were intent on yelling over the music the entire time they were there instead of leaning in to hear one another. but, hey if you aren't hearing a drunk person screaming in another language next to you at most of the places you're at then you aren't experiencing vegas the right way. ha!", 
            "i am so glad we had the chance to dine at sushisamba our last night in vegas! our waiter michael was fantastic and made the entire experience that much more memorable. we literally loved everything we ordered. be sure to make a reservation because it gets very busy, and if you're celebrating anything let the hostess know. we were celebrating our wedding anniversary and they gave us a free small dessert.\n\nsmall plates:\n<mark>Seared W<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> Beef</mark> goyza - do not miss this! it was incredible - every table around us had also ordered it and we were in unanimous agreement.\n\nyellowtail crispy taquitos - light & delicious with an asian dressing on the greens.\n\nrobata:\nribeye - it's described as spicy but it's not, just has subtle spic flavoring and was very tender.\n\n<mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> - phenomenal. there's a reason it's the most popular thing on the menu. melts in your mouth with an amazing miso glaze.\n\nsamba rolls:\n<mark>Neo Tokyo</mark>: similar to a <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> roll flavor but with tuna both inside and on top of the roll. fresh and great flavor.\n\ndessert: \nfried doughnuts with cream dipping sauce - oh my goodness, sooo good. not a light dessert (fried dough) but ah-ma-zing.\n\nsince we were celebrating our wedding anniversary, they gave us a free small dessert of green tea ice cream pops dipped in chocolate with pop candy crust, which was cool and refreshing.\n\nwe will definitely be back on our next trip!", 
            "you can't go wrong with their appetizer and small dishes here. we particularly like <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark> (crispy outside and extra soft inside!!), <mark>Tuna Tataki</mark>, <mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark>!\n\nwe ordered the popular miso <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> large plate, but we think it was ok not that special. \n\nwe really don't like japanese w<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> tobanyaki 2oz because they use coconut cream which makes everything way too creamy and heavy. i don't think coconut flavor go well with the meat too. \n\nhowever, their dessert is awesome! we love their peruvian chocolate cherry custard!! don't let the name fools you. it may sounds like nothing special but they have a special way to make it special. they somehow use chocolate crumble to mix with chocolate pudding and vanilla ice cream and cherry sauce is perfect combination!!!! would come back here again for the dessert itself.", 
            "i'm giving 5 stars because the sushi was fantastic, and the dishes were creative and inspired. love the brazilian fusion. tried two kinds of sashimi ceviche, both delicious. <mark>Scallop</mark> were amazing. had some salmon and yellowtail sashimi that was fresh and perfect. and, a special take on a <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> roll that was unbelievable. the service was fine. not thrilling, but perfectly serviceable.", 
            "this is a review of their happy hour (4-7pm and 11pm until close).\n\nthe skinny: spent $50+ on sub par peruvian influenced japanese food (2.5), service: was slow when we wanted to leave (3) value: seeing as there was only 1 dish out of 8 that we would get again, we won't likely be back (3).\n\nwe were excited to see that they had a happy hour menu while meandering through the venetian properties. we thought great! if the food is good during happy hour, we'll come back another time and try their other regularly priced dishes. \n\nso we ordered 8 out of 10 ($6)items on their happy hour menu. of the 8, we'd probably get only 1 item again. the rest was pretty mediocre considering how much they charge for each dish and the level of cuisine.\n\nwe should have known. i mean when the first dish - yellowtail tiradito - came out, i knew it wasn't going to be good. the thinly sliced 2 pieces of yellowtail were drowning in a pepper sauce. i really couldn't taste the flavor of the fish at all. definitely not well balanced. \n\n<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> (3 pieces) with kabocha puree was okay. although the beef had a wonderful smokiness to it, the gyoza were disappointingly undersalted even after dunking in a good amount of soy sauce. the kabocha squash was relatively flavorless which surprised me after reading reviews about this dish.\n\nchicken anticuchos (2 skewers)were not bad although they weren't particularly memorable either. the meat, slightly grilled/charred, was not crispy enough texturally although it was adequately seasoned.\n\neggplant anticuchos with a side of <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark> was okay. i dug the slightly herbaceous kick of the chiffonated mint or basil, cutting the sweetness of the soy based sauce. however the eggplant was a tinge on the tougher side and needed to be roasted with more oil to give it a better texture.  the <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark> is definitely not one of my favorite foods. potato-like in taste and texture, the chef was able to infuse some acidity to make it more flavorful. it was more palatable with the hit of citrus but still, nothing i needed to try again.\n\nthe sushi (veggie kun - kind of like futomaki, ezo roll - meager amounts of salmon/asparagus with a ton of panko breadcrumbs mixed in = bad mouth feel, and <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> - acceptable but nothing exciting) was the most lackluster portion of our meal. considering rice composes about 50% of sushi, it was highly disappointing to find it overly mushy and over seasoned. it kind of ruined it for me. factor in the high rice to filling ratio, i cannot recommend any sushi dish made here. this is rather unfor<mark>Tuna</mark> because sushi comprises at least a significant portion of the menu.\n\nthe only highlight of the meal was the <mark>Salt and Pepper Squid</mark>. melt-in-your-mouth tender pieces of squid with a delicate batter, this was the one dish that the hubs and i truly enjoyed.\n\nfood service was surprisingly and perhaps questionably prompt. there was a small gap in service with our last dish but it wasn't too bad. it was unfor<mark>Tuna</mark> that the bar service was slower than expected and easily overwhelmed. after our meal, we just wanted to get the check processed and go. however, a loud obnoxious group of women (aka the skanky looking anti-milfs who obviously collected club wristbands) completely commandeered her attention with to go orders. the two other bartenders were milling around but did not help her. so the hubs had to endure some random, potentially contagious woman's behind rubbing against his left leg while she took orders from other groups of people. he was highly grumpy after being mauled and ignored.\n\nin reality, this joint rates about a 2.5 however i rounded up to a three based on the fact that there was 1 dish which was truly outstanding. however, given our experience, we are not likely to return. 3 starred review.", 
            "my dining experience fell short of my expectations considering what we ate (or shall i say what we didn't eat) compared to what we paid. there were 21 of us for dinner and we had the chef's selection, also known as omakase. typically, you would get the most innovative dishes ordering this style.  however, we were served typical menu items.  i think it was just a strategic way for them to serve a larger group without having to cater to individual orders. \n\nthe good was that most of the items we tasted were pretty good. the bad was that we weren't given enough food to taste everything, even though we were all charged the same price.  \n\ninstead, we shared each plate of food between 5-7 people, which included the following: \n(1) <mark>Tuna Tataki</mark>: only got to try it because someone didn't eat raw fish. \n(2) <mark>Seared W<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> Beef</mark> dumplings: not enough brought out so i never got to try it. \n(3) mini yellow tail tacos:  i liked the spicy foam which added a nice kick to the citrus-ey flavors of the dish. \n(4) crab tempura: how ridiculous is it that there were only several pieces to each order so the hubs and i had to share one bite of one piece? this wouldn't even qualify as an amuse-bouche. \n(5) <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> and shrimp skewers: again, not enough so most of us shared skewers. \n(6) steak and mushroom stew: everyone got 1-2 thin slices of beef, which was tender and flavorful. \n(7) sushi rolls/sashimi: the sushi rolls were the most generous items served (about 5 cut rolls) but imo were rather underwhelming. the sashimi, on the other hand, was delicious and fresh. we were given about 3 slices each of yellowtail, tuna, and salmon which i easily could have eaten by myself.\n\ni felt bad for the hubs because he was still hungry and asked what was being served next, only to be told that it was just dessert followed by a $2500 bill ($240 per couple). \n\nyes, our server was pleasant and friendly. yes, the food was quite tasty.  and, yes, they need to recalculate the amount of food for groups ordering from the chef's selection. sure, i expected to pay a lot for this kind of meal, but what i didn't expect was to leave unsatisfied and wanting for more.", 
            "yum!! i always leave ss looking forward to my next visit. the table always enjoys a wide variety of dishes, my fav being the yellow tail with jalape\\u00f1os and lemongrass, lobster tacos, miso <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> and this last visit we tried the <mark>12 Oz Ribeye Tobanyaki</mark> and it was out if this world. even though stuffed one of my friends threatened to order another bowl of the awesome <mark>Coconut Rice</mark> just to not leave an life of the sauce the meat was made in because it had to be eaten.\n\nwe had an extraordinary server that evening but i unfor<mark>Tuna</mark> i can't remember his name!! he reminded us of marky mark in a way.", 
            "my experience at sushisamba was amazing. lively atmosphere and great vibe. the service was impeccable; very attentive. some of our dishes took a little longer than usual (it was a saturday night) but they let us know right away and we didn't mind. the <mark>Tuna Tataki</mark> was very fresh and the <mark>Samba Strip</mark> and green envy rolls were delicious. they even brought out a birthday dessert for me which was thoughtful. definitely would recommend this restaurant for dinner.", 
            "don't order takeout. \n\ni usually love sushisamba and make a point to eat there every time i go to vegas. this time, i was extremely disappointed.\n\ni ordered 2 <mark>Rio Grande</mark> to go since i had to catch a flight and the folks back home love the <mark>Rio Grande</mark>. unfor<mark>Tuna</mark>, part of my order was missing, even after i questioned it.\n\non the bill, the <mark>Rio Grande</mark> was listed as gaucho, so i asked about this and they assured me that it was the same. since i usually have a great meal and the service is usually good, i didn't question it. the <mark>Rio Grande</mark> is 45 dollars on the menu, so i expected to be charged 90 for both. however, for those two items, it was listed as $114. i also ordered 2 sides. \n\ni didn't bring it up because i usually love sushisamba and wouldn't mind paying more to support the restaurant. i also ordered a cocktail and the w<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> appetizer while waiting, so my bill was a bit hefty. on top of this, i included roughly a 20 percent so my total bill was about 190 - after i was reassured that my order was correct. i didn't have time to look through the bag because i needed to catch a flight, but once i got to the airport, i found out that the chorizo and the ribeye steak was not included (usually the <mark>Rio Grande</mark> comes with those two proteins and the picanha, but my order only had the picanha, the two sides i ordered.\n\nyou can imagine my frustration. when i takeout from a restaurant, especially one that i frequent, i expect my order to be correct. i honestly regret tipping so much and even ordering takeout from there today.\n\ni would give 1 star for this experience. the extra star is because i usually do have a positive experience (with philip, who is the best server in the world and has great service).\n\ni don't think i will come back here ever again. something amazing would have to happen for me to give this place a second chance.", 
            "if you are coming to vegas, fine dine yourself at sushisamba. it's an absolute must as there was definitely a samba, fiesta, and crazy epic party in my mouth happening. \n\ni came here for weekday lunch with two friends and it's quite empty but don't let that deter you from eating here at all! do make a reservation just in case! \n\nthe <mark>Uni</mark> ambiance that makes the restaurant look deceptively larger than it is has cozy booths to sit in as we deciphered which choices on the menu to select (because unfor<mark>Tuna</mark> we couldn't have everything... even though we literally wanted everything).\n\norder everything i state here. for real. \njapanese a5 <mark>Seared W<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> Beef</mark> gyoza (all gyoza should be this interestingly gyozawesome)\n<mark>Tuna Tataki</mark> (best bites of tuna i've ever had)\n<mark>Blue Point Oysters</mark> (maximize the aphrodisiacs while you are in vegas)\n<mark>Duck Breast</mark> (can i get a quack quack?!)\ndessert... get the banana split (their deconstructed version is extremely well constructed). \n\ni can't wait to try their location in nyc, but for now i'll reminisce the peruvian-brazilian-japanese vegas food day club party version of wet republic and encore combined!", 
            "love, love, love this place. flawless service, excellent food, and the dj-rocking atmosphere put sushisamba at the top of my list for great las vegas dining. at first, i was skeptical. japanese, brazilian, and peruvian dishes? and they all work together? the answer is yes, indeed they do.\n\nif you're lucky enough to get jimmy as your server, do follow his recommendations. his were spot on, plus he took excellent care of our table all evening. jimmy suggested we give him a price point per diner, and then he delivered a sumptuous multi-course meal, taking us on a culinary trip to all three countries in under two hours. oh, and did i mention i have a food allergy? sushisamba didn't even blink. after my celiac diagnosis three years ago, i thought i had to give up \"chef's choice\" or prix fixe meals. not here. while most of our courses were gf, when they weren't the kitchen prepared gf versions especially for me, and i didn't have to agonize over my choices or worry about my safety. sushisamba took care of everything.\n\nand what dishes they were! start off with a caipirinha, the signature drink of brazil, and then let your server delight your senses. a few of the highlights: the <mark>Tuna Tataki</mark>; yellowtail taquitos; miso-marinated <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>; and the <mark>Moqueca Mista</mark>. the <mark>Moqueca Mista</mark> was the crowd-pleaser of the evening, a beautiful seafood dish with the tastiest chimichurri rice i've ever had. but the star of the evening was the sushi. served as the final courses, we had two huge platters - one gf, one not - and wow, did they deliver. hope to make it back here for another fine meal. viva las vegas!",

            "i ate here last week. i initially enjoyed the ambiance, the nice wait staff, and the wide selection of sushi, robata, and cocktails. however, our food and drinks were littered with inedible garnishes. one of our drinks contained inedible wood sticks and leaves, while the plate came with a side of hollowed out crustacean appendages.\n\nwhile i understand that the harvested tree parts add to the flavor of the drink, the crustacean carcases added nothing to the plate other than to disgust their customers. it was sickening. i almost sent the food back, but i decided to give it a try.\n\nfor<mark>Tuna</mark> the food and drinks were decent. they weren't memorable in the sense that i will tell my friends and family about it, but the food and drinks were a good attempt at sushi, robata, and cocktails. i would give the quality of the food 3 stars.\n\nhowever, when i spoke with the manager about the disproportionate amount of inedible food on the plate, he was extremely rude to me. instead of explaining why the presentation was the way it was, he simply said \"this is the way we make it,\" and he walked away. anyone in a customer service centric job can tell you this is the wrong way to respond to a custom complaint.\n\nat the end of the evening my wife and i were left feeling that we were overcharged, under-served, and disrespected by the management. i could forgive the obvious technical errors with the food if the staff was more comm<mark>Uni</mark>, but the interaction i had with the evening under-experienced manager only added insult to injury, which is why i give this restaurant 1 star.",

            "i love sushisamba! i was very familiar with the london location and this was actually my 2nd visit to the vegas location. the food never disappoints at either venue and if you are new to the brand i would recommend having the server either order for you or working closely with them to craft your own \"tasting menu\".  the concept of japanese, peruvian and brazilian can be intimidating and unfamiliar to most but you have to just go with it! \n\nwe let the manager, jason p, order for us and we couldn't have been happier! he was super friendly and asked about any allergies and dietary restrictions and got everything on point. we had an assortment of small plates: <mark>Green Bean Tempura</mark>, edamame, pardon peppers, a <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> roll, some <mark>Crispy Hokkaido Scallop</mark> lettuce wrap, assorted taquitos of yellow tail / lobster / crab and <mark>Mushroom Tobanyaki</mark> with <mark>Duck Breast</mark>. everything was cooked and seasoned perfectly and the staff even made a point to let us know which items to eat first to enjoy at the best possible temperature. everyone we encountered was friendly, engaging, knowledgeable on the menus and so hospitable! \n\nto sum it up, jason p and the whole ss team know what they're freaking doing and i can't wait to go back!",

            "in early may i was in las vegas on business and wanted to entertain some colleagues for dinner. we were a party of eleven and with that many pallets to please, we needed something different, we needed sushisamba. \n\na couple people in the group had been here before and spoke highly of the fusion restaurant, but for many of us this would be our first time so we made a reservation for 7pm. typically when we travel for business there is always one or two people who join your group at the last minute, so we held a table for thirteen just in case. \n\nmost of us arrived to the restaurant on time however two people were running a few minutes late but on their way. unfor<mark>Tuna</mark> because we were not a party of ten, the server refused to seat us, even though it would only be a few minutes for them to arrive. she also said they could only hold our reservation for 10 minutes.  needless to say, they arrived in time, but i thought that it was not only a poor business decision to seat us early (most people will enjoy a cocktail or two while waiting) but just rude. \n\nwe were seated in the far back of the restaurant and the servers were very attentive. they quickly explained the brazilian-peruvian-japanese fusion concept of the restaurant and then without missing a beat he began to pitch us on the \"chef's choice\" option to the menu. i will admit, it was a good pitch, but obviously too good to be true. with this option the chef would listen to our likes and dislikes and create dishes that appeal to our tastes based on our budget, much like when dining at a chef's table.  the catch to this.... the restaurant was packed, there is no way the kitchen is creating anything special for us.... they're just serving menu items that will maximize your budget and increase your check. \n\nsadly five of us fell for it and ordered the \"chef's choice\" menu, the rest of us ordered ala carte and decided we would share plates amongst each other and asked for separate checks.  funny enough most of the plates that were being served off the \"chef's choice\" menu were the same plates we ordered, but with a few exceptions.  the food was good.  it by no means blew me away, but nothing i ate was bad and i really cant find anything negative to say about it. we had a number of small dishes that included edamame, <mark>Seaweed Salad</mark>, rock shrimp and <mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark>, plus an assortment of sushi rolls. \n\nthe checks came and as expected the \"chef's choice\" total was nearly $100 more than the ala carte (and we had an extra person).  i signed the bill, put the receipt in my wallet and didn't look at it again until i got back to the office and had to submit my expenses. \n\nas i reviewed the bill i took notice to the quantities of the plates ordered. we specifically ordered different items knowing that we were sharing, so i was surprised to see that i had duplicates on five items. i know we all liked the rock shrimp and ordered another plate, so that wasn't a concern. however there was only one other questionable roll that no one recalls ordering and the other three were definitely not ordered, delivered or consumed.... but we paid for it. \n\nwe aren't talking about a lot of money here - $36 - $55, but it's the fact we were obviously taken advantage of.  maybe the waiter wanted a bigger tip, perhaps the restaurant wanted to recoup some funds because we didn't take the \"chef's choice\"? either way i wrote the management group letting them know of my disappointment.  in the end i got an email from the general manager offering to return my $36 with an apology. \n\n\nas a chef, when i am dining out i expect my experience to meet an acceptable level of expectations that may differ from others, however lets face it, with so many choices available these days a restaurant has to be spot on to keep you coming back.  apparently in this case sushisamba needs the money more than i do as i will not be going back.", 
            "i love sushisamba. i always come when in vegas. i was there on a sunday for lunch . we started with the anticuchos with <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark>... these were amazing!  the corn was much bigger than american corn and garnished with some sweet sauce. their sushi is always delicious and fresh i love their salmon roll  and <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> were my favorite .the staff was super friendly and the food came out super fast. always happy to come here.", 
            "so we just finished a late night meal here. i consider me and my fianc\\u00e9 to be sushi connoisseurs. we found it to be just 'meh. but than again, we have been blown away at other restaurants and after all this is a chain....\n\nanyway, we got here after 11pm and were seated. we specifically came here for the happy hour but were told after being seated, happy hour menu is at the bar only. you mean the 15 seat bar? we don't drink so i declined. not to forget, it's no where stated on the menu... our mediocre late night snack came to $70....\n\nshould stuck to my rule of only dining where the locals go. \n\n<mark>Salt and Pepper Squid</mark>- good. not overly fried. lime was nice touch.\n\n<mark>Samba Strip</mark>, <mark>Salmon Avocado</mark> and <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark>... nothing fancy and have had way better.", 
            "food was ok,  a little over priced (3 pieces of yellowtail sashimi, one <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> roll and a beer - $45 before tip).\ni don't recommend sitting at the \"sushi bar\" . the guys are not sushi chefs, just bored guys waiting for an order to fill. . there is no interaction (you have to wait for the server to come around to order your sushi, then wait for them to deliver it), so you spend your meal time with bored guys in front of your and your back to the restaurant. ... oh. .and fricken flies! ! i spent the mealtime swatting away flies. .not exactly what one wants to see when dealing with raw fish :-/\n\nacoustics are horrible,  everyone is yelling trying to be heard. .\n\ni probably won't eat here again.. i prefer a more. .. <mark><mark>Osetra Caviar Imperial 20g</mark> 20g</mark> bar. ..", 
            "had lunch here for the first time.  nothing that blew me out of the water but very interesting flavors.  yellowtail tacos were well done with the spicy foam sauce. yellowtail ceviche and salmon ceviche- maybe i was expecting fresh surprise like nobu's flavored sashimi but it fell quite a bit short. their <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> was okay but not great. <mark><mark>Osetra Caviar Imperial 20g</mark> 20g</mark> was excellent where you can taste the freshness.  my favorite was the tempura green beans.  it was fun trying all these new flavors.  i would recommend for as an adventure.", 
            "i've stayed at the venetian/palazzo a dozen times and had never eaten at sushi samba. what a terrible mistake i've made all these years. looking for a restaurant in the hotel for our bachelor party, we decided upon sushisamba due to the variety of dishes, the vibrant atmosphere, and positive word of mouth reviews. we made a reservation through opentable, and were promptly seated upon arrival.\n\nsamba proclaims to have the most extensive sake selection in vegas, and we let our server choose a cheaper bottle for us and it was delicious. \n\n1) japanese a5 <mark>Seared W<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> Beef</mark> gyoza (4.5/5) - you get 5 delicious pot stickers with quality beef that just melts in your mouth\n\n2) yellowtail taquito (5/5) - there are two mandatory dishes to get and this is one of them. essentially a mini taco with yellowtail, roasted corn miso, and avocado. the explosion of flavor was mind-numbingly good and even friends who don't enjoy seafood loved this\n\n3) yellowtail sashimi (4.5/5) - 4 slices of high quality yellowtail, the sauce is delicate and sour\n\n4)  <mark>Berkshire Pork Belly</mark> (3.75/5) - i am admittedly biased towards <mark>Berkshire Pork Belly</mark> so i loved the dish. the butterscotch miso on top was a little overwhelming but the <mark>Berkshire Pork Belly</mark> itself was cooked to perfection\n\n5) <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> anticucho (5/5) - this is the other mandatory dish. we were very for<mark>Tuna</mark> because the table next to us came 15 minutes after and they ran out of this dish! the <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> skewer is  their signature dish and deservedly so. two skewers of <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> cooked so perfectly (soft on inside, slightly crispy exterior), there aren't enough superlatives to describe how delicious it is. \n\n6) <mark>Rio Grande</mark> (4/5) - from their churrasco menu, includes three types of meat: ribeye, chorizo, and w<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> picanha. i would not suggest this if you are eating by yourself or with another because it is just so much meat. in a larger group setting, i think this dish is perfect to share. the w<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> picanha is my favorite because the meat was so soft and tender.\n\nquite simply, i loved my experience at sushisamba. the service was fantastic. the food was <mark>Uni</mark> and delicious at the same time. the atmosphere embodies that of vegas- vibrant and exciting. the price of the dinner was what i'd expect from a \"strip\" restaurant, so be prepared to spend at least $50. \n\ni can't wait to go back to sushisamba for some yellowtail tacos and <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>.", 
            "this a great place with fantastic food. we kept on ordering and ended up with a bill of over $100 but every penny was worth it. we started by ordering some fresh juice <mark>Salt and Pepper Squid</mark>. portion was small but magical. then we had <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> roll and tirad salmon and again they were amazing. then we ordered sao paolo: something of heaven. needs to be tried for sure the dessert was peanut choco which made us speechless as it was fantastic. highly recommended and good value for money.", 
            "we started our happy hour with several nina frescas and classic mojitos.  fresh strawberry pur\\u00e9e, vodka, orange liquor, and guava.  spectacular and they were only $6 each. next we sampled <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> roll, <mark>Salt and Pepper Squid</mark>, w<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> goya, <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark> roll, chicken anticuchos, and yellow tiradito sashimi. everything was amazingly prepared and all of our choices were perfectly flavored. we sat at the bar and brian explained the menu in detail, recommended drinks, and made sure our service was on point.  everyone at the restaurant was friendly and focused on customer service.  the music and atmosphere was hip and entertaining.  we will be back on our next vegas trip. you can also ask for jason; he will make sure that all of your detailed requests are handled."

            "sushi samba has been a hit or miss with yelpers, and here's my chance to check them out!  featuring a special \"election day menu\" with specialty cocktails and cheap appetizers, it was a perfect opport<mark>Uni</mark>!\n\ndrinks on the menu:\n* obamarama (blue) for $11 \"svedka citron, blue curacao apple liqueur, guava, blueberry\" - really good the first time around. pleasant to look at and just tasty-good.  the guys and gals enjoyed this drink.  the second time i ordered it, there was way too much alcohol though, and not in a good way.  a good cocktail should be enjoyable to drink; i passed the second one off.\n\n* maverick (red) for $11 \"pearl vodka, freshly muddled strawberries, orange liqueur, lime, guava\" - served in a martini glass, so a bit more delicate to drink.  pretty tasty as well. i enjoyed it.\n\nbites to eat:\n* shishito peppers ($2) \"grilled spicy peppers, sea salt and lemon\" - they give you a bunch of these peppers on a plate, and it was okay for me.  i tried one and found that to be good enough.  didn't really care for more.\n\n* <mark>Organic Chicken</mark> aji amarillo anticucho ($2) - i found the chicken to be okay, but really enjoyed the <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark> that came with the dish.  that was the best part of it.  our order had one skewer of chicken, but the party next to us had two? hmm... \n\n* spicy crunchy tuna roll ($3) - really good roll!  i liked this a lot and ordered myself another.  i like how they do their spicy sauce here; it's more mayonnaise-based.  and the slight crunch is nice too.\n\n* <mark>Salmon Avocado</mark> roll ($3) - pretty simple roll with just salmon and avocado.  but it was fresh fish and good.  i'm sad i didn't order more.\n\n* mini chicharron de calamar ($3) \"cornmeal crusted calamari with tamarind sauce, tomato salsa & plantain\" - our friend's order came out soggy, so they thought it was gross.  ours had a better crunch on it, so it tasted better.  it wasn't particularly exceptional, it was okay.  i don't remember any plantain in my dish though.  \n\n* japanese chicken wings ($4) \"teriyaki and sesame\" - it's hard to go wrong with teriyaki chicken wings, right?  good, but messy.\n\n* chilled oyster sampler ($4) \"ponzu jelly & tobiko with three oysters\" - really fresh oysters with an interesting ponzu jelly.  we were supposed to get another order before we left, so i missed out on more!  next time!\n\n* mini yellowtail seviche ($4) \"ginger garlic and soy\" - reminded me of hawaiian poke with the dressing.  it was good with the red onions mixed in there, more poke-like than ceviche-like though.\n\n* crispy yellowtail taquitos ($4) \"shiso, avocado, roasted corn miso and spicy aji panca sauce\" \\u00e2\" two different sauces to put over the taquitos, and it was good.  very messy though as it broke apart after the first bite and was dripping all over my hands.  our order came with two taquitos, but when our friend ordered it, he only got one!\n\n* rosca ($9) \"homemade doughnuts with hazelnut chocolate dipping sauce\" \\u00e2\" recommended by our bartender/waitress as her favorite dessert.  four doughnut holes arrived and they were just okay.  disappointing for us, and we wished we had chosen another dessert instead.\n\nwe spent the whole time at the bar because there was standing room only at this event.  so, the girl making our drinks also served us.  she was busy but tried her best to make our drinks were full and our orders were in.  (our drinks were good for the most part except for that second obamarama we ordered.  but hey, some people like more alcohol in their cocktails!)  i had a bigger problem with the kitchen output and their consistency.  with certain orders coming out, sometimes you got two of something and other times you got one.  our friend mentioned that we got more sushi in our order than when he ordered it.  (makes you wonder what happened to the other pieces.)\n\noverall, we had a decent experience at sushi samba.  you definitely can't beat the price and the atmosphere is casual, which is nice alternative at a strip hotel.\n\n3.5 stars.\n\nthey also offer a happy hour (sunday through thursday from 4 to 7 pm, and then a reverse happy hour from 10 pm to close), available in the bar area only.\n\n(pics posted, of course!)", 
            "this place should change their name to <mark>Samba Sushi</mark> because sushi is definitely the secondary focus of their menu. i ordered the classics: <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> and <mark>Salmon Avocado</mark>. how can you mess that up? the sushi was fresh but absolutely flavorless with no kick. also, for some reason, their wasabi was diluted in intensity as well. \n\ni mean, i know you have to focus on two different types of foods thar originated on 2 different continents but i've been to japanese/portuguese fusion restaurants in brazil and they get it on point! word of advice to the chef/owner: take a trip to brazil and learn how the pros get it done.", 
            "i had such a delightful experience here. everything was amazing from the service to the food. \n\nservice:\ni got seated right away and got service right away. our waiter was amazing. he was oh so attentive and fast as hell with our order and everything else. there are plenty of people running around taking empty plates from your table and refilling your water...which is super important considering you're in las vegas and are probably dehydrated from the night before or from moments before. \ni asked where the restroom was and i was escorted there and once i got to the restroom there was an attendant that escorted me to the correct stall. \n\nfood:\nthe miso cilantro soup is da bomb. go ahead and try it would ya? \ni'm no sushi fan at all but my bf insisted on me trying his eel avocado roll and <mark>Salmon Avocado</mark> roll...holy crap...i like sushi!! these are probably the first sushi rolls i enjoyed. total yum-sicles and magical <mark>Uni</mark> to go along with it. \ni also had the fillet mignon which was flippin good. \n\nlong story short (too late), try this place. it's dope. i will be coming back when i'm in town.",

            "alright, now were getting to the good stuff. \n\nand by \"good\" i mean un-fucking-believable. yea, i said it. unreal. never have i wanted to pick up and move to vegas so much in all of my life, but i'm thinking about it after the dinner i had at sushisamba's new ultra lounge, sugarcane. this is an incredible statement for me because for one, i can only take vegas in small doses, and two, i despise the heat. so having said that you can believe me when i say that i love absolutely everything about sushisamba, the brazilian/peruvian/japanese fusion restaurant at the palazzo. \n\nwhere do i begin?\n\noh yes, holy mary mother of god, i've died and gone to heaven...\n\na friend of mine is the publicist for this new restaurant, as well as the brand spanking new, sugarcane. she hooked up a dinner reservation for me and some friends so that we could celebrate my good friend's birthday in style. upon our (late) arrival we were greeted warmly by the wait staff, as they explained to us that our party would be the very first members of the public to sit down to dinner in their brand new ultra lounge. as we walked through the dimly lit hallway, past the dj booth and dance floor, and into the dining area portion of sugarcane we were immediately taken back by the overall design concept of the space. i\"m gonna do my best to do it justice but i would highly recommend a trip here to experience for yourself because it is just too complex for words...\n\nthe walls are covered with graffiti-style murals of samurais and japanese script, the dance floor has a canvas like screen that wraps around the circular pods that make up the women's bathrooms (see pics) where they project abstract imagery to coincide with the music playing. the dj that night was claudio who i wanted to put in my pocket and take home because the music was just that dope. there are multi-colored glass cylinders that hang from the ceiling and beams of light (see pics) that separate the dance floor from the dining area that change from red to orange to white that create a truly magnificent effect. \n\nthe food and service is on a level that is even harder to explain - it was incredible. our waiter anthony took such good care of us we felt as though we were old friends by the time we left. of course, we were the first to be seated and the last to leave, so i guess if you spend enough time with your waiter (four hours) you begin to feel like family. our sake sommelier was a hilariously funny girl (i forgot her name) and very helpful and knowledgeable when describing our sake selections. we ended up choosing a bottle with gold leaf cherry blossoms there were supposedly good luck if you found them floating in your drink. \n\nour table decided to order the signature sushisamba 7-course omakase ($70 per person) as our dinner selection. anthony asked us if we had any food allergies or other special requests before going back to the kitchen to get our party started. our first course was a selection of appetizers (see pics) which included the kobe beef carpaccio with <mark>Mixed <mark>Wild Mushrooms</mark></mark>, seared ahi tuna on a tiny bed of spinach, and (my favorite) tiny ceviche fish tacos with a chili foam sauce that was amazing! next up was the best snow crab i have ever tasted, <mark>Filet Mignon</mark>, duck, chilan <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> (unreal), grilled tomatoes, fish jowel (i forget what kind) and the most beautiful sashimi plate i've ever seen/tasted. just when we thought we couldn't eat any more came the sushi course. a stand out roll was the kobe beef wrapped roll with (from what i can remember) a <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark>, cucumber and avocado center. as we sat back in our booth contemplating exactly how we were planning on walking out of there, anthony presented the birthday girl with an incredible chocolate fondue plate (see pics) complete with japanese-style sesame rice krispies, japanese cake, homemade marshmallows, and a selection of fruit. there were also mini fruit tacos with both mango and banana, with a chocolate mousse and caram<mark>El Topo</mark>. \n\ndo you see what i'm talking about?????\n\nhere's the rundown....\n\nparty <mark><mark>Assortment of Four</mark></mark>:\nfirst round of cocktails (on the house)\nseveral cocktails to follow\nbottle of premium sake\n7- course omakase dinner for four ($70 each)\nafter dinner cocktails\ndivine dessert platter\n\ntotal bill: approx $600\n\nnot bad i'd say. not bad at all. \n\nall in all, i plan to go back to visit several times over. anyone who stumbles upon this place should consider themselves lucky to be in the presence of such foodie excellence. this dinner made our entire trip, and made for a very, very happy birthday girl. \n\nsushisamba: the wait staff, the owner, the managers, the dj. you rock my rock-n-roll world.", 
            "modern chic fusion restaurant in the new palazzo hotel, featuring brazilian and japanese food. the interior much reminded me of social house in treasure island, dark and swanky. the small plates are meant for sharing, but the tab adds up quick. the server proclaimed their sake menu as the largest in the country, but unfor<mark>Tuna</mark> we didn't get to try any.\n\nwe had the <mark><mark>Assortment of Four</mark></mark> sashimi which were nice and fresh with delicate flavors. my favorite was the tuna with granny smith apple, serrano, and lime.\n\nthe <mark>Hamachi Kama</mark> (yellowtail cheek) was as good as i've had, but missing the grated daikon that it <mark><mark>Osetra Caviar Imperial 20g</mark> 20g</mark> comes with.\n\nchicken liver anticuchos (two skewers served over <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark>) were very livery. i expected them to be only lightly livery, like my favorite pho ga place serves up, not sure if it's due to the prep or the <mark>Grade A5</mark> liver or what.\n\nwe also tried a couple rolls, the <mark>Neo Tokyo</mark> with yellowfin tuna, tempura flake, aji panca. i liked this one more than the bobo brazil with seared kobe beef, avocado, kaiware, shiso, red onion, chimichurri. the kobe beef looked raw rather than seared, maybe seared would have brought out the flavors a bit. both rolls were pretty good though.\n\nthe standout of the meal was the <mark>Berkshire Pork Belly</mark> butterscotch miso, which was meltingly tender, with a subtle sweetness contrasting the richness of the luscious pork.\n\nwe also tried the little tiny crabs we saw in an ad, sawagani, which are flash fried japanese river crabs. these were literally tiny, and the small bite had a texture like an egg shell, with a flavor best described as a subtle fish sauce.\n\ncome here if you have an appetite for a variety of small bites with delicate but well thought out flavors.",

            "i almost want to give this a 5. near oh my god moment, but not quite.\n\nthis is a little misleading. i swear this came up under \"chinese\" on yelp while we were looking for something (in a group <mark><mark>Assortment of Four</mark></mark>) but this is definitely not chinese. it's japanese brazilian fusion, which i had never had, but was awesome. the menu is a bid daunting, but the waitress offered to bring out a tasting menu for us, based on the common questions like, \"are you ok with raw fish,\" \"do you have allergies,\" \"how do you eat red meat,\" etc. this was helpful - usually i'm not fazed by the large menu, but for some reason i was having problems focusing. worth mentioning they say up front that they'll take back anything we don't like, no charge, and they do ask for a budget to keep them in line.\n\nwhat we got was really pretty exceptional. gyoza steamed and pan fried, hamachi taquitos (not what you're thinking - not the deep fried rolls, but little taco shells filled with hamachi sashimi), seared tuna with baby greens and crunchy salt, and portabella fries with kabocha aioli. all sounds fancy, all really good.\n\nthen a warm plate - grilled <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> with a sweet glaze, <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> (not their a5 w<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark>, which we were offered for an upcharge, but declined) and <mark><mark>Alaskan King Crab</mark> Leg</mark>, all with a side of elote. the bass was good - tender and flaky, and i like the glaze. but it was crazy overpowered by the beef and crab. firstly, the beef was far superior to what we had at n9ne. tender, flavorful, and with a great salt and pepper crust on the outside, served with a little pile of powdered chile for dipping. and the crab was that near oh my god moment. an *enormous* <mark><mark>Alaskan King Crab</mark> Leg</mark>, brushed with a sort of thick butter sauce, served piping hot. wow, this was exceptional. and while i guess i should expect it, points to the restaurant for realizing that serving a filet and a <mark><mark>Alaskan King Crab</mark> Leg</mark> family style to diners that have only chopsticks required that you slice things up in to nice little bite sized pieces.\n\nfinally, sushi. their <mark>Neo Tokyo</mark> roll, which is their version of the <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark>, a hamachi roll with spicy crab and avocado on top, a tuna roll with asparagus, dusted with wasabi, and an assortment of sashimi and nigiri. as well as a hot roll - something covered in melted mozzarella, crispy onions and a sweet sauce. all of the cold rolls were good - i especially liked their <mark>Neo Tokyo</mark> roll. the sashimi was also very good, but the hot roll...i could do without. it was in interesting twist - not just the cheese was hot, but the entire roll, rice and all. however, the cheese and a heaping helping of onion and sauce overpowered whatever might have been inside. this was about the only misstep i could find.\n\nthe atmosphere is odd - lots of pounding techno music, along with an odd video collage (on many many video screens) of brazilian beach babes, bullet trains, brazilian slums, and japanese salarymen trudging to their soul-murdering jobs. not sure what they were going for. but whatever.\n\ngreat spot - chinese though it wasn't, we all were appropriately full when it was over (not hungry, no stuffed) and we all agreed we'd be back. the total bill, excluding drinks, was probably about $65 per person. i loved the mix of appetizers, hot beef and seafood, and sushi. if you're going with a group, this is a fun way to try stuff without having to worry about reading a menu.", 
            "this place was awesome! isabella was a phenomenal guide for our party <mark><mark>Assortment of Four</mark></mark> and lead us through a 5 course tasting menu of amazing and diverse flavors, textures, and experiences. this is a 5 star place; it's pricy, so know that going into it, but extraordinary nonetheless!"

            "i've never seen a kids menu available at a japanese or asian fusion restaurant. the little boy dining near us was given one of those training chopsticks that are screwed together and all you have to do is pinch...or maybe it was his own...unsure. haha. \n\nthe ambiance was just lovely. while my fellow diner and i waited for our order, we gazed the room and talked about it for a good 10 minutes. \n\nthe server was very friendly-all smiles- and she described all the dishes we had questions about and gave us great recommendations. we ordered:\n\nseviches and tiraditos (4 assortments for $35, good deal)\n      -<mark><mark>Jumbo Shrimp</mark></mark> =very fruity, didnt mix with the salty items, but good\n      -kanpachi = a very anomalous taste, you'd either hate or love it\n      - yellowtail tiradito = yellowtail is alwayys yumm\n      - yellowtail seviche = recommended along with ^\n\nwe ordered three samba rolls\n1) <mark>Samba Strip</mark> roll (<mark>Half Maine Lobster</mark>) = good amount of lobster and was yummy.\n2) bobo brazil (seared kobe beef) = was pretty good\n3) pacific (crab) = mediocre\n\nthis place is a little pricey, but you can't get these rolls elsewhere can you? idk, you try and tell me.", 
            "this restaurant is a chain and was pretty good.\n\nbeing a girls weekend away from home, we started off with their cocktail tree which is $70, but totally worth it! then we ordered otsumami which is an assortment of edamame, <mark>Green Bean Tempura</mark>, and shishito which was really good. their aioli sauce had a hint of truffles and a strong garlic taste but wasn't too over powering and made it really good with the <mark>Green Bean Tempura</mark>.\n\nafter that we had the <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark> that had bibb lettuce, tobanjan alioli, black truffle vinaigrette and in my opinion was only average. for my entree i had the miso-marinated chilean <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> and that was really, really good. very moist, tender, juicy and not fishy at all. it's everything you could wish your fish to be. the portion was a little small, but it was oh, so good!! i also had the <mark>Samba Strip</mark> roll which had <mark>Half Maine Lobster</mark>, mango, tomato, chive, crispy rice, soy paper, peanut curry and i thought it was alright. but for the price and how much lobster they gave us, it was really worth it.  the last thing i had was their <mark>Neo Tokyo</mark> roll that had yellowfin tuna, tempura flake, aji panca, which is also really good. \n\nmy overall experience was only a 3 stars because they said they were really busy that night (but didn't look that way to me because there were at least 5 empty tables in front of us) and they sat us in a corner and our waiter was a complete douche and couldn't get our order right nor could he remember what we ordered and came back on several occasions to reconfirm what we ordered. the manager there was also dumb and tried to help out only to make things worse because he asked us what we wanted to drink and didn't even bring our drinks and completely forgot about us. \n\nin the end, i'd come back cause the food was good, but hopefully i'll get better service next time.", 
            "this restaurant caught my eye because it was something out of the ordinary from your typical sushi restaurant. the menu offered an intriguing variety but when i began reading the reviews i knew i had to try it. i would suggest anyone going there for the first time to try the dining experience because you may think you know what you want but the chef knows better! the server asks if there is anything you do not like or if you have any food allergies and then how much money per person you're looking to spend. there are options anywhere from $50 per person to $130 per person if kobe beef if something that interests you. as it was for a special occasion we opted for $80 per person and even though thats more than i have probably ever spent on a single meal there were no regrets.\n\ncourse #1 consisted of berkshire pork gyoza which is basically pork dumplings in a pumpkin puree and yellowtail ceviche taquitos, both of which were absolutely delicious and not necessarily something i would have ordered on my own.\n\ncourse #2 was yellowtail sashimi in a spicy peruvian sauce with a slice of red jalapeno on top and octopus sashimi in a japanese citrus sauce which again were both to die for!\n\ncourse #3 had an array of <mark>Filet Mignon</mark>, <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>, <mark>Alaskan King Crab</mark> and <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark>. all were moist and tender but the <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> absolutely melted in your mouth! <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark> was a yummy alternative to <mark><mark>Osetra Caviar Imperial 20g</mark> 20g</mark> as well.\n\nfinally, course #4 was the main sushi dinner. <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark> rolls were delicious, but the <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> with i believe tuna on top was absolutely amazing! there was also <mark>Half Maine Lobster</mark> and another roll which i believe had lobster in it as well and was probably the only thing of the entire dinner that i was not absolutely amazed with, but it was still good!\n\nanother great thing about this place is they tell you if there is anything throughout this meal you do not like they will take it back and bring you something else! as our server said, \"its like a money back guarantee!\"\n\nanyways this is definitely a place i would tell everyone who loves trying new things to try or even just the sushi lover. do it! it will not disappoint!\n\nonly part i would complain about is the fact that there is not one in california!!!", 
            "this place is sooo good!!!\nwhen we first walked in, the decor is super pretty. place looks really trendy and it was packed on a wednesday night. ambience is very hip and is perfect for a date night or girls night out.\n\ndrinks\nnina fresa - our server recommended this drink and its super yummy! its a vodka cocktail drink with strawberries and guava.\n\nfood\nsalmon seviche - excellent seviche... the sauce has a tangy pineapple taste mixed with a little bit of spice because of the jalapenos. really good appetizer.\n\n<mark>Berkshire Pork Belly</mark> robata - i think this is the best out of everything that we ordered. the <mark>Berkshire Pork Belly</mark> is super fatty on the outside (but in a good way) and just melts in your mouth. it has a sweet/salty glaze on top of the meat. this dish is just amazing. i highly recommend this dish.\n\n<mark>Lamb Chop</mark> robata - good dish but since they served it with the <mark>Berkshire Pork Belly</mark>, this dish was overshadowed.\n\nbobo brazil - not your typical sushi roll because they put <mark>Seared W<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> Beef</mark> on top! this roll is super good though!!! i really recommend this one too.\n\n<mark>Samba Strip</mark> roll - out of all the dishes that we had, i was least impressed with this roll. i ordered it because of the <mark>Half Maine Lobster</mark> but the portion is super small and the taste is bland compared to the price ($19.00). if you really wanna try this dish, i suggest you skip the sauce because it overpowers the <mark>Half Maine Lobster</mark>.\n\nservice is okay and i notice the waitress did not course our meals... refill on drinks is also a bit slow.\nhowever, i would definitely go back to this place if ever i'm back in las vegas. :)",

            "on the saturday of my bachelorette party, my girlfriends treated me to dinner at sushi samba.  it was a fabulous, memorable meal, where we ate well and celebrated in style.\n\nwe were staying at the palazzo, and sushi samba was the perfect venue for the occasion.  it was convenient to get to in heels, and the atmosphere was festive, edging on clubby without being obnoxious.  we had a big comfortable table, and service was excellent.  i wish we'd gotten the name of our waiter - he did a great job attending to our every need, and he guided us through the whole dining experience with expertise.  (for management - he was a tall guy who served a party of nine on 6/29.  you know, your only bachelorette party of the month?)\n\nwe ordered cocktails, which were pretty good.  i had a blame it on rio, a caipirinha variation with cacha\\u00e7a, agave syrup, fresh lime juice, cucumber, and jalape\\u00f1o.  it was both cool and spicy, and it went down really easy.  the classic caipirinha was also great, with just the cacha\\u00e7a, lime, and sugar.  i also tried some of the chu-cumber, a shochu drink with hendricks gin, elderflower liqueur, and muddled cucumber - very refreshing.  at some point, we got a complimentary cocktail tree, a beautiful iron tree bearing shot-sized wine glasses on every branch.  they held some frothy, sweet version of a screwdriver that was great for the occasion.\n\ndinner was delicious.  we had the option of ordering a la carte or omakase, and we decided to keep things simple.  we specified a price point and listed dietary restrictions, and the food just started coming.  it was all served family style, and everything was well portioned for our big group.  we left full but not overstuffed - a plus, since it had taken a team to stuff me into my white dress for the night.  the cuisine was fun, a creative, unforced fusion of japanese and peruvian styles.\n\nfirst, we had a trio of vegetable otsumami, all served together in a lovely green array.  there was the staple edamame with sea salt and lime, and <mark>Green Bean Tempura</mark> served with a rich black truffle aioli.  my favorite of the three, though, was the handful of shishito peppers.  these were grilled blistering black, polished with sea salt and lemon.  they were pretty irresistible.  next we got a tray of japanese a5 <mark>Seared W<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> Beef</mark> gyoza.  these were great, thin-skinned and stuffed with luscious hunks of beef rather than the usual mince.  they came with kabocha pumpkin pur\\u00e9e, a sweet soy drizzle, and a su-shoyu dipping sauce.  the best thing i ate all night, though, was a crispy taquito overflowing with yelllowtail, avocado, and roasted corn miso.  the shell was thin and crunchy, and the fresh, tender fish was just right with that avocado, miso, and some thinly sliced vegetables.  the taquitos were served with spicy aji panca sauce and fresh lime - that piquant, frothy sauce was just the icing on a beautiful fusion taco cake.\n\nafter the smaller plates were done, we moved on to big platters of sushi and sashimi.  i do not remember everything we got, as there were at least six or seven rolls and even more kinds of sashimi.  the rolls were great, a nice mix of california standards - you know, the mix and match of eel, yellowtail, tuna, etc. with avocado, cucumber, and dots of mayo - and more samba-specific stuff, with the stray <mark><mark>Alaskan King Crab</mark> Leg</mark> and lobster claw.  i particularly liked the <mark>Samba Strip</mark>, with <mark>Half Maine Lobster</mark> tempura, mango, tomato, chive, soy paper, and a coating of crispy rice.  it was unusual and flavorful, served with a peanut curry.  the rest of the platter came with a sweet thick soy sauce and a bit of mayo.  the sashimi was more traditional, served on a bed of ice.  it was hard to share, as there was only one of each kind, but the slivers i had were great.\n\nthe most filling part of the meal was the churrasco course.  we got two hefty platters of the <mark>Rio Grande</mark> with three meats, grilled hanger steak, ribeye, and chorizo.  these were great, juicy and tender and full of that hearty grilled meat flavor.  they came with a trio of dipping sauces - malagueta pepper oil, chimichurri, and a third that is infuriatingly absent from the menu.  we also had some sides of rice, beans, collard greens, and a medley of <mark>Roasted Seasonal Vegetables</mark> - giant corn kernels, toothsome brussels sprouts, carrots, celery, pearl onions, and more.  we also got miso-marinated chilean <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> a la carte, with roasted organic vegetables and oshinko.  this was a winner - the fish was moist, flakey, and shot through with miso flavor.\n\nwe were full by dessert, but loved the complimentary chocolate mousse, served with a sparkler and a congratulatory message.  the lush mousse came topped with crunchy chocolate pearls, whipped cream, and a little bit of candle-stuck banana.  we each got a sweet bite to end our wonderful dinner.\n\nin conclusion, my friends are the best - thank you girls for this weekend, and for this fun, delicious meal.  sushi samba was an a+ choice, worthy of a night i won't soon forget.", 
            "the service and food is amazing.  i came by myself - a mini vacation before monday business - and was treated like i was a party of 10.  i ordered one of the special samba rolls - <mark>Half Maine Lobster</mark> in crispy rice with asparagus, avocado and mango with a nice peanut dipping sauce.  i was pleasantly surprised that it came with a lobster claw with a good serving of lobster meat.  the sushi is also high quality.  i enjoyed one of my base test sushis of tuna and it was very fresh and flavorful.  don't miss this great sushi spot at the palazzo.", 
            "food is good. prices are not.\n\n- <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>: $29 miso glazed and pretty freakin delicious. cooked perfectly also. but the portion was probably 3 maybe 4 bites at most.\n\n- handrolls: we had salmon skin, salmon and avocado, <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark>, and yellowtail. the ingredients were fresh, but the rolls were very small and about ~$8-$10/each.\n\n- various rolls: we tried the yamato ($19 for 3 pieces). there wasn't even enough for me to get a chance to try it since there were only 3 pieces lol, but my friends said it was probably the best roll there. pure decadence being topped with <mark>Foie Gras</mark>, caviar, and gold flakes. we also tried a few other rolls for which i can't remember the names (sorry!) but they had <mark>Seared W<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> Beef</mark> and another had <mark>Half Maine Lobster</mark>. both were interesting, but i wasn't blown away.\n\n- nigiri: fresh but again, extremely pricey! $5-$10 a piece! yup, not an order of 2 pieces...that price is per piece! o_o\n\n- sides: we ordered the corn and plantains at $7 each. the corn was delicious but a very small portion in a cup. same thing with plantains. grilled deliciously but only a few slices for a whopping $7.\n\nif you haven't gotten the undertone of my review yet, it's that this place is expensive! lol we each paid roughly $50/person and no one left feeling full. it wouldn't have been so bad had the service been better though. we were missing a few things at the table and had to ask several times for it (place setting, water, and soy sauce dishes).", 
            "\"professor in the mist\"\n\npretty brown legs moved her quickly about the room, her tight black skirt barely hiding what lay beneath. eyewear gave her a professorial look, high heels a come hither look. yet it was the direct and patient manner in which she explained the menu items to my father that sealed her as the total package for me. i wish i remembered this fine creature's name but, alas, i was much too smitten to remember such a detail.\n\ndad ordered his usual scotch and mom and i opted for plain water. as we looked over the fare--a japanese/south american type blend--i kept stealing looks at the professor. she caught me a few times but neither of us cared. both of us smiled, in fact. it was an old game played by many throughout time, usually with far more success than ever attained by yours truly. that aside, the dining room was darkly lit, with a sushi bar in back and bar in front. a raucous group of tuxedo wearing party boys were slamming shots on the stools but eventually simmered down. perhaps one of the uber hawt barmaids had mentioned their over exuberance and they'd relented.\n\nanyway, after smooth as silk tutoring from the professor my dad finally settled on <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>(miso) and <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark> with a side of <mark>Roasted Seasonal Vegetables</mark>. mom went with a single samba roll which contained <mark>Half Maine Lobster</mark>, mango, tomato, chive, crispy rice, soy paper and peanut curry. and as for me, i wasn't in the mood for seafood so i asked for chicken teriyaki(samba style) with <mark>Purple Potato Mash</mark> potatoes. \n\nthe verdict?\n\nperhaps everything was fine. i never really know when with my parents. their company is somewhat like being immersed in fine mist after a few drinks. you can sort of see and understand what's going on, but not very clearly, which means you occasionally misread what's actually occurring. to wit: dad liked his fish(but he picked the restaurant so he would have liked whatever slop they put in front of him). mom said her lobster roll was good(but she never says negative things until years after the fact. kind of like her own statute of limitations if you will). and me? i always kind of defer to their mindset when in their company so i think my chicken and potatoes were good, although for something touted on the menu as a large plate i wish there had been more bird and buds.\n\neventually the professor laid our check on the table, and dad swiped it up before i could, although i must confess it was a lame and slow attempt on the part of my right hand. he gave his usual 15% tip and we departed sushisamba--which by the way is located off the shopping section of the palazzo hotel/casino. \n\ni guess we might have had a nice time there(i can't really be sure) but this much i do know: mist or no mist, the professor in high heels forever has my heart in her grasp....", 
            "had the <mark>Samba Strip</mark> roll with <mark>Half Maine Lobster</mark>, mango, crispy rice and peanut curry.  awesome!!  had the yamato roll with caviar, <mark>Foie Gras</mark>, and gold leaf.  awesome!!  also has the edamame with chili lime sauce.  awesome!!", 
            "since we were staying in the palazzo, i figured it would be easiest to dine in the hotel our first night in vegas. sushisamba sounded like a really interesting fusion of brazilian, peruvian, and japanese cuisine.\n\ninside i found a very lively, posh atmosphere. there was great music playing, giving it more of a club ambiance than that of a restaurant. i also liked the graffiti paint job on the walls. our waitress was tremendous, and the manager came to check on us periodically too. they definitely aren't lacking in the service department. all in all, this was a really enjoyable place to eat dinner.\n\nwe decided to go tapas style and order a bunch of different things to try. my dinner companion didn't have any preferences, so i ordered two small plates (<mark>Seared W<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> Beef</mark> <mark>Salt and Pepper Squid</mark>), two kinds of sashimi tiradito (kanpachi and tuna), and two samba rolls (<mark>Samba Strip</mark> roll and <mark>Sasa Handroll</mark>).\n\nour small plates came out first. i was excited to try the <mark>Seared W<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> Beef</mark>, which comes with a ponzu gelee, honshimeji mushrooms, and a truffled tofu crema. the meat was amazingly tender, and i liked the acidity of it all. even the mushrooms were very flavorful. the <mark>Salt and Pepper Squid</mark> was also very good. it comes with dry miso, shichimi, sea salt, crispy garlic, and smoked soy. this dish was definitely spicy. it was like calamari, but way better.\n\nnext up was the sashimi tiradito. the kanpachi (amberjack) comes with yuzu, sea salt, and black truffle oil. it was absolutely packed with flavor, and i enjoyed the saltiness of it. the tuna is served in a ceviche-style bath of granny smith apple, serrano peppers, and lime. it was beautifully sweet and spicy at the same time.\n\nwe were getting a little full, but we still had two samba rolls to go. the <mark>Samba Strip</mark> roll is a combination of <mark>Half Maine Lobster</mark>, mango, tomato, crispy rice, soy paper, and peanut curry. i absolutely loved the mango in there, which paired nicely with the peanut. the <mark>Sasa Handroll</mark> was very different from what you might expect sushi to be. it comes with <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark>, quinoa, shishito, cilantro, spicy mayonnaise, and red onion wrapped in some sort of cone. our waitress suggested we get two, since it's not very conducive to sharing. i agree. the sasa roll was a little difficult to eat, but well worth the effort. \n\ni didn't think we had waited very long for our dinner at all, but nonetheless the manager thought so, and to make up for it she brought over complimentary green tea sorbet pops for dessert. to put it mildly, they were amazing!\n\nsushisamba was absolutely top notch all the way around.", 
            "lunch at sushisamba is the best!  we were promptly seated at a round table with a good view of the whole restaurant.  the restaurant energy is vibrant, full of energy and colorful.  we ordered 2 orders of the 3 kinds of seaweed 'cos we love seaweed!  i love the crunchy pink seaweed, the light green is the common one and the black seaweed was a little coarser.  all were good!  the <mark>Salt and Pepper Squid</mark> arrived - succulent and tender.   next came the <mark>Huancaina Fries</mark> - peru potatoes with queso fresco - delicious!  oh yes!  our favorites were up next:  <mark>Hamachi Kama</mark> - yellowtail fish collar - 2 beautiful pieces charred with a squeeze of key lime and a side of su shohyu sauce - fresh and so tasty!  each one got one <mark>Hamachi Kama</mark> - and that's a lot of fish!  \n\nsuddenly there was break and no food arrived.  we were wondering what happened... then appeared the manager with 2 plates - one dish of <mark>Broiled Peruvian Bay Scallop</mark> (there were 4 in total)  with on one dish and the other a taco with waygu beef for my mum 'cos she's lactose-intolerant.  i was wondering why the waiter had asked us if we had any seashell allergies or any allergies at about 1/3 of the way into our lunch.  now, i know why!!  :o).  the manager explained that he wanted to give us these free appetizers 'cos we were repeat customers!  how generous!  \n\nwe also ordered 2 more rolls - <mark>Samba Strip</mark> - <mark>Half Maine Lobster</mark> - need i say more!  and the lima roll - shrimp and crab.  yummy rolls and the best i've ever had!! \n\nservice was fantastic and we will come back again!"

(to be honest, i just wanted to fill my stomach so that i'd be able to drink later!) luckily, one of our friends is a sushi samba master, and he did all of the ordering for our table. \n\ni pretty much loved everything - if only for the novelty of it all - but a few stand-out dishes were:\n1) yellowtail ceviche taquito: they looked like little yellowtail and guacemole tacos. somehow it all worked...\n2) yellowtail tiradito: kinda like a ceviche? yellowtail, jalepeno, and lemongrass - i'm definitely a fan of sour and spicy.\n3) fresh oysters and <mark><mark>Jumbo Shrimp</mark></mark>: no explanations needed.\n4) <mark>El Topo</mark> roll: salmon, jalepeno, melted cheese, and crispy onions\n\ni also would recommend getting a side of <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark> (which went along with our churrasco plate) just to see how huge those kernels are! it's kind of ridiculous. anyway, not only was the food great, but the service was among the best - they even have a \"sake sommelier\", so to speak. the place itself is energetic, contemporary, and very, very vegas. i can't wait to go back!",

            "so we had a fabulous room in the palazzo and needed to have a fabulous dinner to go with it.  we were dying to go back to bobby flay's mesa grill in cesar's, but when i saw that our own very hotel had a fusion restaurant, marrying japanese, brazilian, and peruvian flavors, i knew we had to take our money there.  my daughter's part peruvian, and she never gets to experience the cuisine.  plus she loves sushi...well, vegetable sushi to be exact.  \n\nas soon as we arrived, i was feeling the service and the decor....nice hostess seated us right away and an informative waitress gave us the rundown of the menu.  i had plenty of time after ordering to scope the murals (fat tip usage in a restaurant?  oh yea!).  \n\nthe children's menu also impressed me.  it was a cute menu of that collabed with an artist to give a percentage of each bento box to charity.  wow!  my kid ordered the sliders and switched out sweet potato fries for <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark> (corn on steriods, as the waitress called it).  we weren't extremely hungry, or in the need for a drink, so we ordered light:\n\nteriyaki chicken skewers\n<mark>Miso Soup</mark>\navocado rolls\nprawn tempura\nmore <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark>\nplantains\nwhite rice \n\nas you can see, we didn't order any of the restaurant specialties, but what we did get was delicious and filling.  however, as you probably already figured out, this place is $$$!  the <mark>Miso Soup</mark> was $6 and no different than the free soup we get at our fave sushi spot back home, and the white rice was.......$5!  wtf!  $5 for \"japanese\" style rice?  just because you put sesame seeds on top does not make it $5 (we are filipino and require white rice with our protein always.)  oh well, that was the most disappointing part of the dinner.  \n\nthe most impressive part of our dinner was the kids bento box.  i wish they had bento boxes for adults because that's what i always order at a japanese joint.  her sliders were the smallest sliders i have ever seen, but they were oh-so-cute and worked for a child.  they came with seasonal fruit, which was like 2 blueberries and half of a strawberry, and the <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark> was soooo good!  my daughter ended up skewing up some on the toothpicks from the fruit (sushi samba, if you use that on the menu, please credit jada).  plus, the box came with the cutest dessert ever...a tiny smoothie with pop rocks on top and a little brownie ice cream sundae.  once again, so small and petite but it worked for her!\n\ni'm not sure if i would be excited to go back again, as i still am to go to mesa, but if i do i might give the drinks a try.  after reading many of these reviews, i realize i have missed out on some great sushi specialties and drinks (and a trip to the fancy bathroom!).\n\n-tiph", 
            "sushi samba is dark but nicely decorated.  we ordered two beers, edamame, <mark>Miso Soup</mark> and four rolls.  rolls were average to slightly above average.  the <mark>Samba Strip</mark> roll ($19) was ok but not worth the price.\n\noverall good sushi place.  total with tip was about $100.", 
            "if you are not interested in being open-minded to an array of fusion tapas featuring japanese, brazilian, and peruvian inspired palettes...then this is place not for you. if however you are interested in being more cultured in regards to your typical sushi restaurant, then you may continue reading.\n\nsushi samba is a great restaurant to taste a blend of very <mark>Uni</mark> flavors...the menu is not your typical one but rest assured, your server is happy to answer any of your questions. the server started off by asking us if we've been there before...i have so i said yes. if i would have said now, he would have prefaced our meal with a story of the restaurants background i.e. stylings of food, etc. i know this because i overheard another server doing it. \n\nwith any tapas joint it is always easy to over order...and me, my bro, and his fiance did just that. here is what we got.\n\n-shishito (grilled peppers): the sea salt adds a great flavor, the peppers themselves are literally grilled\n- <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> robata: a small portion of robata grilled <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> cooked exactly how i wanted\n- <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> and miso swewers: recommended by our server, these skewers were off the hook!!!! melted like butter in my mouth...the miso flavor was out of this world.\n-<mark>Miso Soup</mark>: the only difference between this soup and the others...they add cilantro\n-<mark>Coconut Rice</mark>: the side order of rice could actually feed 2 people. we ordered 2 not knowing this. the coconut flavor is not at all overpowering...i've gotta learn how to make this rice!\n-green envy roll: yum!!! salmon and tuna rolled with some crunchies to make this fine number\n-<mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> roll: not as spicy as i thought it would be but still yummy\n-<mark>Rio Grande</mark> (5 meats): this meal on its own came with black beans, collard greens, rice, 5 different meats, and 3 sauce pairings. wow! you need to order this...there was 3 of us and we couldnt finish but the options were great. the sauces were extremely complementary.\n\nsure our meal came out to $172.69 pre gratuity for 3 people but for the service, quality and presentation of the food, and the ambiance...the price seems quite fitting.", 
            "my cousin and i decided to try out this restaurant during our memorial weekend trip in vegas. i was extremely excited to try this place because of all of the positive reviews/rants i've heard. i am always looking to try new sushi places and i must admit that i am quite the sushi expert!\n\nthe first thing i must say is that this place is pricey! for $85 i only able to order:\n\n- 2 glasses of cabernet sauvignons\n- 2 <mark>Miso Soup</mark> ($6.00 each and only had 1 tofu in each bowl of soup)\n- <mark>Rainbow Dragon</mark> roll\n- 2 avocado salmon rolls\n- 1 piece of salmon sashimi (embedded in an unknown vegetable)\n- 3 hand rolls\n\nmay i remind you that all of this was shared between two people. the portion size was fairly small. however,the freshness and the quality of the fish was amazing. that is probably the only thing positive about this restaurant. oh yes, can't forget the fancy lighting and ambiance.\n\ni was not impressed by the originality of the menu nor the taste of the food. i have tasted better sushi rolls for more than half the price of a sushi samba roll. i would have rather spent $85 at my local sushi restaurants in san jose. at least there will be many tofu pieces in my <mark>Miso Soup</mark> not only 1. =p\n\n-", 
            "i went here because the hotel complex had few other restaurant options open at 11 pm on a weeknight - and it was remarkably bad - at those prices, and since it's advertised on the room cards, i expected pretty solid food.\n\nthe fish on my sushi was simply not fresh enough, nor handled correctly - i felt that their special rolls were just mediocre cuts and quality fish, doused in overly sweet sauce to hide the inadequacy.  \n\nthe <mark>Miso Soup</mark> was bad enough to send back, if i didn't feel too tired to deal with the hassle; it had an off putting smell to it, was oversalted, and was almost exclusively broth - no seaweed, almost no tofu, and a few sliced raw scallions.  \n\nalso, expensive, even by las vegas strip standards.\n\nservice was adequate, but barely; they didn't refill my water glass without prompting, and acted a bit surprised / almost rude when i declined to order alcohol, but nothing major.\n\npotentially, part of my problem was in ordering exclusively from the \"japanese\" part of the menu, but it does have the word sushi in the name - why would i expect the sushi to be terrible?", 
            "wanted to try ss for a long time, and now that i was staying @ palazzo, i had to get in there. we went for an early dinner on a weekday. the place was empty, and we were seated right away. the menu was honestly, somewhat intimidating, and really shi shi. i like sushi, sashimi, sushi rolls, etc. i didnt really vibe with the brazilian twist the menu had. i did not research the menu enough before going in there. (which was good in retrospect, because then i probably wouldnt have gone there, and missed a great meal.) i assumed- sushi samba= sushi. lol. we ordered regular sushi rolls, sashimi pieces and <mark>Miso Soup</mark>. the miso was great. the <mark>Grade A5</mark> the sushi was out of this world. def some of the best i have had, and i am a sushi addict. i have eaten it all over at home, and i try to get it whenever i am on vacation. def recommend. there are high prices for the specialty fusion foods (which made me nervous and therefore i stuck with what i knew), but the place is gorgeous, service was fantastic, and if you are willing to take a chance on the specialty foods, im sure you wont be disappointed.", 
            "the staff here was very attentive and the space looks fantastic but the menu was a bit too weird for me. most things on the menu are japanese but with a brazilian twist. my gf and i weren't totally up for the twist. we're just big fans of japanese food especially sushi. we ordered some rolls and <mark>Miso Soup</mark> and found everything to be fantastic. this was the best <mark>Grade A5</mark> we ever had in vegas. if the menu wasn't so weird and intimidating i would have given this place more stars.", 
            "for the price we paid, i expected so much more in the taste department.\n\ni eat sushi on the regular, and was expecting something new, delicious and exciting out of <mark>Samba Sushi</mark>. a local recommend us to try this spot, so we did. spent over $150 for two people and this is what our meal consisted of:\n\n- two <mark>Miso Soup</mark>\n- two <mark>Seaweed Salad</mark>\n- two rolls\n- two cocktails\n\nend of story, not worth the money at all. now i don't mind spending a pretty penny for something downright tasty, this was far from it. everything was so mediocre and bland. i left hungry, pissed and wanted to knock out the guy who suggested we piss away our money on this place.", 
            "came here to grab dinner on a random day.  no special occasion.  my friend and i found the service average, the decor strange/ugly, and the food interesting/questionable.  it's supposed to be a japanese/brazilian fusion place.  i can see this place being a real pleaser for people who are not familiar with authentic japanese or brazilian food.  being japanese with a sister-in-law from brazil, i found myself qualified to test the food out.  i think the only dish i got that i found myself satisfied with was the edamame....but it's pretty much impossible to mess edamame up.  my 7 year old niece can make it blindfolded.  \n\ni recognized that things might be bad from the start with the <mark>Seaweed Salad</mark>.  wow was it awful.  nice presentation but no flavor!!  it was so watered down that i couldn't even taste the seaweed itself.  i might as well have eaten gelatin with no flavoring.  it was that bad. \n\ni also got the red miso.  it was mixed with truffle oil and mushrooms.  i did not find the truffle oil mixed with the <mark>Miso Soup</mark> appetizing at all....the flavors just did not mesh for me.  \n\nthe sushi was a bit too fusion for me....i found the flavors to not really complement each other.  i did order regular tuna sashimi just to get something with no fusion and more japanese authenticity....the tuna quality was excellent but woah overpriced!  $4.50 for one piece of sashimi.  it was good but not that good.  the ramen was ok...nothing to talk about later.  \n\nas you can tell, we were not impressed.  we ordered an array of things expecting for something to blow us away, but we were disappointed.  $80 later, we headed home and looked for something on the way to satisfy our appetites.", 
            "bbq <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> skewers, <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark>, yellow tail terditico, and a cup of <mark>Miso Soup</mark>. i could probably eat this every day for the rest of my life and not complain.", 
            "we had a large dinner party and ordered separately. we did not order appetizers or cocktails, just the main course. my family had the three meats (grilled hanger steak, ribeye and pork tenderloin) and the miso-marinated chilean <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>. the meats were flavorful. we enjoyed the ribeye and pork tenderloin the best of the three meats. the <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> was good, but it was not worth $29 for a tiny piece of fillet fish. we thought it was going to be a whole fish, enough to serve more than one person. the service was good when our waiter took our order, but he never came back to check up on our table to see how we were doing. we had to order extra rice and <mark>Miso Soup</mark> from other waiters and staff. our waiter finally came to our table just to drop off the check. the manager came around and asked about our food, and we told him about the issue with our waiter. he apologized and offered us bite-sized cookies. the food was good, but the service was okay.",

            "fantastic flavors, quality service, squishy seating just about sums up my experience. went here on saturday night and enjoyed the overall experience. my friend and i started with <mark>Miso Soup</mark>. then, when looking at the menu, my friend raved about <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>. i said i wasn't sure if i've had it... this time was memorable. before we ordered, we asked the waitress what she recommended. she mentioned the <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> and miso robato to share and a few rolls. we picked one roll not on the menu and the bobo brazil. nom nom nom we loved it all. the skewers of <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> were delicate with nicely flavored sauce. it came with giant corn pieces that were sort of fun and different. the bobo brazil roll was very nice - i think i had this particular roll at the chicago location, the kobe beef gets me. the sauce on this one was a bit tangy and citrus-y. i think there were the roll that was not on the menu had tempura shirmp inside with crab on top with thinly sliced avocado. the flavors and textures were incredible. highly recommend this place for a nice meal. my only issue was with the seating. the hostess had to literally shift over the table each tiem she sat a new couple - we were in a tight area full of tables for two. we came on a busy saturday night, so i also recommend reservations.", 
            "this place is inside palazzo. we got lazy one night, so ended up eating in hotel. the atmosphere was good. it was loud, dark, and trendy. the food was mediocre. wasn't terrible, just not exceptional for the price. portions are small. they have an impressive sake menu. however, our waitress didn't know anything about it. asked for recommendation, and she was clueless. plus she pronounced \"saki,\" which drove me nuts. if u work in a sushi place, at least learn something about the culture. check the price before you order anything. <mark>Miso Soup</mark> was $6 with only a few chunks of tofu. that's it! no seaweed, shiitake. rip off. all in all, if u r paying for vegas atmosphere, not food, then this would be an option.", 
            "wow! this was definitely the highlight of our trip!  the atmosphere is amazing, very cool and hip.  our waitress was probably the best we've ever had; she was friendly, fast, and so helpful with recommending items from the menu.  \n\nwe had the edamame to start, and they were perfectly done with a delicious sprinkle of sea salt & lime. <mark>Miso Soup</mark> was yummy.   we then tried the beef tenderloin and aji panca, and the <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark> was scrumptious!  we had a <mark>Samba Strip</mark> roll & a green envy roll... omg, so good!  \n\nfor dessert we had the chocolate fondue.  such a cute presentation, and simply a delicious finish to our meal.\n\nwhen we got our bill, we were surprised at how much we had spent, but we both agreed it was completely worth every penny! best meal we've had in vegas, by far!",

(not for everyone obviously) if you stay at the venetian or palazzo and love sushi go here! the neo-tokyo roll and <mark>Miso Soup</mark> (with cilantro! what??! amazing!) was everyone's favorite, simple but delicious and the best price on menu. on the flip side we also had the oyster platter for the table (expensive but beyond worth it) was literally the best oysters any of us had tried. i will literally be back next time i'm in vegas!"

            "alright, now were getting to the good stuff. \n\nand by \"good\" i mean un-fucking-believable. yea, i said it. unreal. never have i wanted to pick up and move to vegas so much in all of my life, but i'm thinking about it after the dinner i had at sushisamba's new ultra lounge, sugarcane. this is an incredible statement for me because for one, i can only take vegas in small doses, and two, i despise the heat. so having said that you can believe me when i say that i love absolutely everything about sushisamba, the brazilian/peruvian/japanese fusion restaurant at the palazzo. \n\nwhere do i begin?\n\noh yes, holy mary mother of god, i've died and gone to heaven...\n\na friend of mine is the publicist for this new restaurant, as well as the brand spanking new, sugarcane. she hooked up a dinner reservation for me and some friends so that we could celebrate my good friend's birthday in style. upon our (late) arrival we were greeted warmly by the wait staff, as they explained to us that our party would be the very first members of the public to sit down to dinner in their brand new ultra lounge. as we walked through the dimly lit hallway, past the dj booth and dance floor, and into the dining area portion of sugarcane we were immediately taken back by the overall design concept of the space. i\"m gonna do my best to do it justice but i would highly recommend a trip here to experience for yourself because it is just too complex for words...\n\nthe walls are covered with graffiti-style murals of samurais and japanese script, the dance floor has a canvas like screen that wraps around the circular pods that make up the women's bathrooms (see pics) where they project abstract imagery to coincide with the music playing. the dj that night was claudio who i wanted to put in my pocket and take home because the music was just that dope. there are multi-colored glass cylinders that hang from the ceiling and beams of light (see pics) that separate the dance floor from the dining area that change from red to orange to white that create a truly magnificent effect. \n\nthe food and service is on a level that is even harder to explain - it was incredible. our waiter anthony took such good care of us we felt as though we were old friends by the time we left. of course, we were the first to be seated and the last to leave, so i guess if you spend enough time with your waiter (four hours) you begin to feel like family. our sake sommelier was a hilariously funny girl (i forgot her name) and very helpful and knowledgeable when describing our sake selections. we ended up choosing a bottle with gold leaf cherry blossoms there were supposedly good luck if you found them floating in your drink. \n\nour table decided to order the signature sushisamba 7-course omakase ($70 per person) as our dinner selection. anthony asked us if we had any food allergies or other special requests before going back to the kitchen to get our party started. our first course was a selection of appetizers (see pics) which included the kobe beef carpaccio with <mark>Mixed <mark>Wild Mushrooms</mark></mark>, seared ahi tuna on a tiny bed of spinach, and (my favorite) tiny ceviche fish tacos with a chili foam sauce that was amazing! next up was the best snow crab i have ever tasted, <mark>Filet Mignon</mark>, duck, chilan <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> (unreal), grilled tomatoes, fish jowel (i forget what kind) and the most beautiful sashimi plate i've ever seen/tasted. just when we thought we couldn't eat any more came the sushi course. a stand out roll was the kobe beef wrapped roll with (from what i can remember) a <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark>, cucumber and avocado center. as we sat back in our booth contemplating exactly how we were planning on walking out of there, anthony presented the birthday girl with an incredible chocolate fondue plate (see pics) complete with japanese-style sesame rice krispies, japanese cake, homemade marshmallows, and a selection of fruit. there were also mini fruit tacos with both mango and banana, with a chocolate mousse and caram<mark>El Topo</mark>. \n\ndo you see what i'm talking about?????\n\nhere's the rundown....\n\nparty <mark><mark>Assortment of Four</mark></mark>:\nfirst round of cocktails (on the house)\nseveral cocktails to follow\nbottle of premium sake\n7- course omakase dinner for four ($70 each)\nafter dinner cocktails\ndivine dessert platter\n\ntotal bill: approx $600\n\nnot bad i'd say. not bad at all. \n\nall in all, i plan to go back to visit several times over. anyone who stumbles upon this place should consider themselves lucky to be in the presence of such foodie excellence. this dinner made our entire trip, and made for a very, very happy birthday girl. \n\nsushisamba: the wait staff, the owner, the managers, the dj. you rock my rock-n-roll world.", 
            "having been to their sister establishments; china grill co, i had high expectation for this place.  i am a huge fan of asian fusion anything.  i would give this place 5 except for the small tables we were sat at.\n\nthis place was extremely busy with your <mark><mark>Osetra Caviar Imperial 20g</mark> 20g</mark> down tempo music playing.  it has a huge projector screen displaying various images of sport or anime.  we made rsvp and got seated within 10 minutes.  \n\nhere we go, the host sat us right by the server isle between the entrance and the kitchen, not impress and not off to a good start.  after getting bumped several times i asked to be moved.  then they moved us to a table that was so close to another couple that we might as well been sharing the bill.  there was no room to move.  i told my girl to wash her hands first before sitting down because we have to pull the table out and asked the people on both side to excuse us.  so far, even worse start.  \n\nnow the food, we were told that the portions are small, so be prepared to order a lot and to damage the amex.  we asked for some recommendation from our server whom by the way was absolutely excellent and was there for everything we need.  he even apologized for the tomato can seating we were in.  we ordered the tuna taquitos which was <mark>Uni</mark> with taste and textured - 5.00 per pc.  we had the yellow tail carpaccio with yellow sauce - 18.00 for 5 pcs and worth every penny. i had the <mark>Filet Mignon</mark>,small and pricey but again worth it.  jennifer had the <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>, again soft and <mark>Uni</mark> flavors, we also had the <mark>Lamb Chop</mark> from the robata and it is the best <mark>Lamb Chop</mark> i had recently.  we also had a few rolls as well, small but delicious.  for desserts we had the donut holes dipped in melting chocolate.  again,the great taste!!!  \n\nthe service is impeccable, even with small tables, the drinks were <mark>Uni</mark> a bit soft, but the flavors were remarkable.  the portions are extremely small, but again, the taste are <mark>Uni</mark> - japanese with brazilian.  the table next to us were from europe (whom thought this place was as of value, i guest that what happens when you get a euro into a dollar; instant discount) recommend we try the sampler menu - 80.00 per person but 7 courses. the server did too.  the next time we will since we did spend over 200.00 there.  \n\nsushi samba is now my top 5 places to eat at, we can't wait to go back there in a few months.", 
            "overpriced!!!!\n\nthis place is waaay overpriced. appetizer size plates for $20 with barely enough food on them to feed a fish. sushi was nothing to rave about....i have had much better at my local sushi joint. spent a lot of money for an empty stomach in the end. sure the place is beautiful with nice decor but would i really pay all that for that food. i think not! \n\n<mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> was the best dish i had...it almost melted in your mouth. i perhaps would return for this dish but at $20 for two kebabs....i would have to think about it. <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> was about the size of half your palm for $20...ridiculous if you ask me. some good flavor but too expensive for me to return. you definitely do not get what you pay for here.",

            "more of a 3.5...  although i love trendy, high ceiling restaurants that give you a modern feel..sushi samba's decor is a little too cluttered for me. maybe its because of the fact that its a twist between brazilian, japanese, and peruvian cuisine...where they feel like they need to include all three of the cultures art.. but whatever the case may be, theres just.. too much orange swirls, too many funky paintings, and too many weird faces on their walls. i like more of the simple trends. they play trendy music..which is a plus...but they crank it up as if you're in a club which in turn makes everyone talk louder than usual. it's almost as if you're in a convention. \n\n\nsome of the items that i've tried and have a vivid memory of:\n\n-yellowtail sashimi tiradito. tasted like...yellowtail in salsa. it was good..but it was different. i usually like my sashimis in ponzu sauce.\n\n-mushroom toban-yaki is reallllly good. it comes out in a hot sizzling clay pot with like four of five different kinds of mushrooms. \n\n-<mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> taquito\n\n-robata: \n<mark>Filet Mignon</mark>\n<mark>Lamb Chop</mark>\n<mark>Cherry Tomatoes</mark>\nshiitake mushrooms\n\noysters, uni sashimi. \n\noverall, its not too bad. i like the convenience. the two times i've been here was because i stayed at the palazzo. takes like 5 mins to get here from our room.",

            "i've been jaded by the whole fusion cuisine fare as there's so many that have done it terribly wrong.\n\nthis isn't the case at sushi samba.\n\nmy wife and i decided we take a chance and boy we were impressed.  i let our waitress know that we'd just like to try \"whatevers good\" and to please do not hold back...\n\nwe were entertained with 4 different sashimi dishes, tuna with a granny smith green apple puree, kampachi in truffle oil, squeeze of lime & some sea salt, salmon in mandarin orange reduction & kampachi in some sort of chile vinegrette... all awesome.\n\nnext we were served with some items from the robata, although the end pieces of the <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> did come off a bit dry, the prep, grilled green onion and center of the piece made up for it... i would of liked it not so seared but still great flavors.\n\nthis was also my first time having a ceviche with passion fruit sauce, let alone a lobster ceviche.. it was absolutely delicious. the sauce <mark>Shrimp and Vegetables</mark> were super colorful but all the flavors complimented each other nicely. a tiny bit of sourness from the passion fruit to substitute the <mark><mark>Osetra Caviar Imperial 20g</mark> 20g</mark>, and some truffle oil made it taste super buttery.. super delicious.\n\nthere were a couple other dishes that weren't as memorable, but were still very delicious.  eitherway, it didnt break our bank and i enjoyed our \"early dinner\".\n\nservice was great. pretty standard for all the restaurants there (we went to the las vegas, nv location in the palazzo)",

            "i almost want to give this a 5. near oh my god moment, but not quite.\n\nthis is a little misleading. i swear this came up under \"chinese\" on yelp while we were looking for something (in a group <mark><mark>Assortment of Four</mark></mark>) but this is definitely not chinese. it's japanese brazilian fusion, which i had never had, but was awesome. the menu is a bid daunting, but the waitress offered to bring out a tasting menu for us, based on the common questions like, \"are you ok with raw fish,\" \"do you have allergies,\" \"how do you eat red meat,\" etc. this was helpful - usually i'm not fazed by the large menu, but for some reason i was having problems focusing. worth mentioning they say up front that they'll take back anything we don't like, no charge, and they do ask for a budget to keep them in line.\n\nwhat we got was really pretty exceptional. gyoza steamed and pan fried, hamachi taquitos (not what you're thinking - not the deep fried rolls, but little taco shells filled with hamachi sashimi), seared tuna with baby greens and crunchy salt, and portabella fries with kabocha aioli. all sounds fancy, all really good.\n\nthen a warm plate - grilled <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> with a sweet glaze, <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> (not their a5 w<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark>, which we were offered for an upcharge, but declined) and <mark><mark>Alaskan King Crab</mark> Leg</mark>, all with a side of elote. the bass was good - tender and flaky, and i like the glaze. but it was crazy overpowered by the beef and crab. firstly, the beef was far superior to what we had at n9ne. tender, flavorful, and with a great salt and pepper crust on the outside, served with a little pile of powdered chile for dipping. and the crab was that near oh my god moment. an *enormous* <mark><mark>Alaskan King Crab</mark> Leg</mark>, brushed with a sort of thick butter sauce, served piping hot. wow, this was exceptional. and while i guess i should expect it, points to the restaurant for realizing that serving a filet and a <mark><mark>Alaskan King Crab</mark> Leg</mark> family style to diners that have only chopsticks required that you slice things up in to nice little bite sized pieces.\n\nfinally, sushi. their <mark>Neo Tokyo</mark> roll, which is their version of the <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark>, a hamachi roll with spicy crab and avocado on top, a tuna roll with asparagus, dusted with wasabi, and an assortment of sashimi and nigiri. as well as a hot roll - something covered in melted mozzarella, crispy onions and a sweet sauce. all of the cold rolls were good - i especially liked their <mark>Neo Tokyo</mark> roll. the sashimi was also very good, but the hot roll...i could do without. it was in interesting twist - not just the cheese was hot, but the entire roll, rice and all. however, the cheese and a heaping helping of onion and sauce overpowered whatever might have been inside. this was about the only misstep i could find.\n\nthe atmosphere is odd - lots of pounding techno music, along with an odd video collage (on many many video screens) of brazilian beach babes, bullet trains, brazilian slums, and japanese salarymen trudging to their soul-murdering jobs. not sure what they were going for. but whatever.\n\ngreat spot - chinese though it wasn't, we all were appropriately full when it was over (not hungry, no stuffed) and we all agreed we'd be back. the total bill, excluding drinks, was probably about $65 per person. i loved the mix of appetizers, hot beef and seafood, and sushi. if you're going with a group, this is a fun way to try stuff without having to worry about reading a menu.", 
            "before our night out on the town, we needed to fuel ourselves with some yummy food. to take the guess work out of trying to figure out what everyone wants, we went ahead with the $50 omakase dinner.\n\nour waiter went around the table & asked all 8 of us our likes & dislikes so the chef can come up with our own custom menu. my favorite dishes of the night were the grilled <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> skewer & the a5 kobe gyoza. to show the attentiveness of the restaurant: 1 of our friends cannot eat spicy food so she got her very own portion of <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> instead of the spicy beef skewers.\n\nin additional to the delicious food & great service, we also got a round of pi\\u00f1a colada & our bride-to-be got a beautiful chocolate dessert.\n\nwe had a wonderful dinner followed by a fun night of show watching, dancing, & boozing. whether you are with a big group or only with a few good friends, this is a great place for a delicious & creative meal.", 
            "amazing! great food, great atmosphere, great service & staff, great selection! \n\nwe made a reservation on tuesday night, got there 15 min early and was seated right away with no issues. my biggest compliment is to our server vanessa...she was extremely knowledgeable about the menu! i couldn't decide between a few things on the menu as separate dishes and she suggested to put two of them together into one dish and promised it would be incredible. and it was! i ordered the <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> and she paired that into the <mark>Mushroom Tobanyaki</mark> and the poached egg was over the filet, it was a dynamite dish!", 
            "got <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> (medium), salmon-avo roll, <mark>Soft Shell Crab</mark> roll, snow crab cali roll, and miso chilean <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>. <mark>Soft Shell Crab</mark> was pretty soft, salmon pieces were really tasty, and definitely loved the chilean <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>. <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> was very soft. however, the <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> was a bit dry... that's where my minus one star goes. server was nice! they also have omakase if you want :) it's of course pricey since it's vegas!  but good experience overall :d", 
            "amazing doesn't begin to describe the experience my boyfriend and i had here the other night. we wanted to grab dinner before checking out frank the man the music and decided to pop into this location at the palazzo. the entire staff was so attentive, from nonstop refills on our soda to very customized suggestions on different menu items. we had carmine and he was awesome! we went with a three course approach for two and couldn't have been happier with what we chose (<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark>, neo roll, the duck, <mark>Filet Mignon</mark>, and chilean <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>). the manager jeff came over to speak to us and brought over some additional items to try - such a great touch to our experience.  can't rave about this place enough - we will definitely be coming back here on our next trip to vegas! thank you for a great experience! :)"

            "who would have thought on a normal tuesday night at 8pm, we would need a reservation? sushi samba proved us wrong. after our experience there, i now see why they have restaurants in some of the biggest cities in the world. \n\nfirst of all they told us that we would have a 50 minute wait. as we were leaving to find another place, the hostess informed us that they could fit us at the counter. the \"counter\" is a raised area that looks out into the restaurant. i'm struggling to figure out how to describe it right now. it's a long table where everyone sits in a row- like a sushi counter- which overlooks the dining area. and you have to be very careful while sitting there. there's not much room and i doubt the people with spacious bench seats below us would appreciate a spilled drink. however, it was the perfect spot for people watching. \n\nservice was a little slow. hence, the 4 stars. it took a while for us to get refills on our drinks. the server came over once without us having to wave her down. but food was amazing. i recommend the serviche and taraditos (especially the tuna). the <mark>Duck Breast</mark> robata was also amazing. between the 3 of us, we tried quite a few dishes and we were quite happy with all of them. \n\nit is a little pricey, but i definitely think this is a great place to try at least once in vegas!", 
            "my favorite thing about this restaurant is the option of having a \"custom menu.\" for a flat per person fee, you can ask your waiter (ours was max, who was incredibly attentive and friendly) to order your food for you. as a restaurant with three kitchens (japanese, brazillian & peruvian, don't quote me on that last one), the diversity of dishes you can consume is great. \n\nevery time a dish was brought out for us, max would sit down for a couple seconds and explain each dish. it was really fun not knowing what came out next! for about $70/person (with tip) we got:\n\ndumplings and ceviche\nfour types of sashimi\n<mark>Peruvian Corn</mark> & grilled miso <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>\nalbacore tuna roll & <mark>El Topo</mark> roll\nbraised <mark>Duck Breast</mark> with japanese mushrooms\n\nall of which were amazing. do the \"custom menu.\" it's what makes this place <mark>Uni</mark> and fun!", 
            "intrigued by the japanese/south american fusion going on here and the rather good yelp reviews, i ended up here with a group for a late dinner one sunday night during a recent trip to vegas. we were seated promptly at our reserved time.\n\nthe service was immediately kind of odd. our waiter did not give us menus (other than for drinks), but instead started talking about how if we had a particular budget in mind, they could send us enough food to fill that budget. butbutbut...i saw the menu online! i knew there was a menu. i wanted to be in control! would the waiter let us be in control?\n\nafter awhile yes, yes he did. we were able to secure some menus, and he then proceeded to go through the different sections of the menu with us as if we were eight years old and/or eating dinner by ourselves at a restaurant for the first time. is fusion really that scary for people?\n\nso we ordered a couple of rounds, tapas style, like we do. there were hits and misses along the way. the best stuff was in the robata area of the menu. the <mark>Berkshire Pork Belly</mark> with the butterscotch miso about slayed me with its awesomeness. the <mark>Duck Breast</mark> dish we got was also killer, with a fantastic sauce and lots of meaty, meaty mushrooms. the shishito peppers were solid, as was the sea eel we got nigiri style. it's hard to mess those two up. the yamato rolls, in all their decadence, were worth every penny.\n\nthe <mark>Seared W<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> Beef</mark> was probably the biggest miss of the evening. the menu does not list truffle oil in the dish's ingredients, but that's about all i could taste. and for me, truffle oil makes everything taste and smell rancid. not appealing. the <mark>El Topo</mark>, while quite good, was also a bit of a disappointment. i love fried onions, but they seemed to overpower here. the yellowtail sashimi also seemed a bit off, as the lemongrass sauce wasn't particularly complimentary. \n\nthe service was alright but stayed a little odd during our visit. sometimes our waiter would be absent for long periods of time, and then suddenly would be around almost too often. the place was loud, almost too loud. prices are about what you'd expect for a sushi spot on the strip. overall, i enjoyed this place, but it is easily overshadowed by the plethora of better options nearby.", 
            "off the charts delicious!  superb service!  taquitos and <mark>Duck Breast</mark> were awesome. i don't remember the rolls but both were so tasty.", 
            "this place was great the server recommended something's that i found very tasty.\nthe lobster ceviche was amazing soooo good. i asked about the <mark>Duck Breast</mark> and he recommended the mushroom and sauce which was so rich and flavorful i loved it. this place is tits i kid you not . a++++ at the very least", 
            "if you are coming to vegas, fine dine yourself at sushisamba. it's an absolute must as there was definitely a samba, fiesta, and crazy epic party in my mouth happening. \n\ni came here for weekday lunch with two friends and it's quite empty but don't let that deter you from eating here at all! do make a reservation just in case! \n\nthe <mark>Uni</mark> ambiance that makes the restaurant look deceptively larger than it is has cozy booths to sit in as we deciphered which choices on the menu to select (because unfor<mark>Tuna</mark> we couldn't have everything... even though we literally wanted everything).\n\norder everything i state here. for real. \njapanese a5 <mark>Seared W<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> Beef</mark> gyoza (all gyoza should be this interestingly gyozawesome)\n<mark>Tuna Tataki</mark> (best bites of tuna i've ever had)\n<mark>Blue Point Oysters</mark> (maximize the aphrodisiacs while you are in vegas)\n<mark>Duck Breast</mark> (can i get a quack quack?!)\ndessert... get the banana split (their deconstructed version is extremely well constructed). \n\ni can't wait to try their location in nyc, but for now i'll reminisce the peruvian-brazilian-japanese vegas food day club party version of wet republic and encore combined!", 
            "i love sushisamba! i was very familiar with the london location and this was actually my 2nd visit to the vegas location. the food never disappoints at either venue and if you are new to the brand i would recommend having the server either order for you or working closely with them to craft your own \"tasting menu\".  the concept of japanese, peruvian and brazilian can be intimidating and unfamiliar to most but you have to just go with it! \n\nwe let the manager, jason p, order for us and we couldn't have been happier! he was super friendly and asked about any allergies and dietary restrictions and got everything on point. we had an assortment of small plates: <mark>Green Bean Tempura</mark>, edamame, pardon peppers, a <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> roll, some <mark>Crispy Hokkaido Scallop</mark> lettuce wrap, assorted taquitos of yellow tail / lobster / crab and <mark>Mushroom Tobanyaki</mark> with <mark>Duck Breast</mark>. everything was cooked and seasoned perfectly and the staff even made a point to let us know which items to eat first to enjoy at the best possible temperature. everyone we encountered was friendly, engaging, knowledgeable on the menus and so hospitable! \n\nto sum it up, jason p and the whole ss team know what they're freaking doing and i can't wait to go back!", 
            "wow, what do i say?\n\nthis place blew us out of the water. \n\ni'd gotten recommendations to dine here if i ever visited vegas. those people are on top of their food game. (looking at you aj) \n\nsometimes, places are hyped up and i end up having a disappointing meal, even if it was good. this place was not that.\n\nour server, jeff, was friggen awesome. he was so friendly and informative. he really knew his stuff and he didn't give us any pressure. super attentive also, he came around like 3 times while we were going over the menu to see if we needed help. we ended up going with an omakase style of ordering. we gave him a budget of $80pp and told him our must haves and to just wing the rest. he did an excellent job.\n\nnotable dishes:\njapanese a5 <mark>Seared W<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> Beef</mark> gyoza  - when this dish came out, i was a bit underwhelmed. it just looked like bland dumplings on a plate, but the texture and taste of this was just amazing. it was melt in your mouth, different textured, simple but tasty flavours. i would definitely have more of this.\n\nassorted sashimi & rolls - the fish was really fresh here. any of the sashimi would be a good choice. i can't remember what rolls we got, but they were generally really good. there was one that was a bit bland and i believe it was shrimp inside. \n\n<mark>Duck Breast</mark> - okay, so.. no joke. this dish ruined mushrooms and duck for me. after our table had this, we couldn't stop raving about it. my mouth is watering just thinking about it right now. a whole <mark>Duck Breast</mark>, skin and fat on, seared a perfect medium rare, served on a bed of assorted mushrooms in an asian liqour sauce. holy moly my, this was so good. definitely the best thing we had all night.\n\nso, given that our budget we gave was $80pp, it came up to around $115pp after tax and tip (and we gave a generous tip), and this included a dessert platter (which was delicious as well) and a beer each too. \n\nthis is a definite must in vegas! 6 stars if i could."

            "modern chic fusion restaurant in the new palazzo hotel, featuring brazilian and japanese food. the interior much reminded me of social house in treasure island, dark and swanky. the small plates are meant for sharing, but the tab adds up quick. the server proclaimed their sake menu as the largest in the country, but unfor<mark>Tuna</mark> we didn't get to try any.\n\nwe had the <mark><mark>Assortment of Four</mark></mark> sashimi which were nice and fresh with delicate flavors. my favorite was the tuna with granny smith apple, serrano, and lime.\n\nthe <mark>Hamachi Kama</mark> (yellowtail cheek) was as good as i've had, but missing the grated daikon that it <mark><mark>Osetra Caviar Imperial 20g</mark> 20g</mark> comes with.\n\nchicken liver anticuchos (two skewers served over <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark>) were very livery. i expected them to be only lightly livery, like my favorite pho ga place serves up, not sure if it's due to the prep or the <mark>Grade A5</mark> liver or what.\n\nwe also tried a couple rolls, the <mark>Neo Tokyo</mark> with yellowfin tuna, tempura flake, aji panca. i liked this one more than the bobo brazil with seared kobe beef, avocado, kaiware, shiso, red onion, chimichurri. the kobe beef looked raw rather than seared, maybe seared would have brought out the flavors a bit. both rolls were pretty good though.\n\nthe standout of the meal was the <mark>Berkshire Pork Belly</mark> butterscotch miso, which was meltingly tender, with a subtle sweetness contrasting the richness of the luscious pork.\n\nwe also tried the little tiny crabs we saw in an ad, sawagani, which are flash fried japanese river crabs. these were literally tiny, and the small bite had a texture like an egg shell, with a flavor best described as a subtle fish sauce.\n\ncome here if you have an appetite for a variety of small bites with delicate but well thought out flavors.", 
            "i really liked this place just a couple of things ruined the experience for me. first of all we sat in this tiny tiny table and i could totally smell and almost taste what the couples next to me were eating/order.. i can't even begin to tell you how close we were.. ew.  and i was soo overwhelmed with the menu. but i guess that is a good thing. oh and i did not like the ceviche taco, too smushy for me.\n\nour waitress was amazing, all her suggestions (the <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> and the <mark>Berkshire Pork Belly</mark>) were our faves. \n\nwe also got the sashimi platter, over 14 pieces of sashimi and it filled me up! \n\nthey comped me a birthday cake which was delicious!  this is now on my vegas rotation!",

            "our waiter made a really good point that many people believe your restaurant is a <mark><mark>Osetra Caviar Imperial 20g</mark> 20g</mark> restaurant if you have sushi in the name. however, this place certainly did not disappoint.\n\nso this location is a mix of chilean, brazilian, and japanese tastes. it certainly was <mark>Uni</mark>. the environment is vibrant and alive. i felt that it really complimented their fusion style really well. they had flat screen tvs and projectors everywhere, showing pleasant scenery or <mark><mark>Osetra Caviar Imperial 20g</mark> 20g</mark>. i was just amazed by their design and color throughout the restaurant. their decor was also very compatible with their theme. the look was sharp and inviting at the same time.\n\nthe food was great. i tried the bobo brazil roll. i tried this because i wanted to experience their <mark>Uni</mark> tastes, and it certainly brought the restaurant's fusion tastes together. it had seared kobe beef and red onions on top of what i think was an avocado roll with kaiware, and some other ingredients. it cost $17; the taste was awesome, but we could not decide whether or not it was worth the full $17. other items we ordered included a <mark>Berkshire Pork Belly</mark> ramen, a ribeye bento box, and a terriyaki chicken bento box. these were generic dishes, but they turned out great.  \nthe restaurant serves dishes in appetizer or small portions. do not expect a large portion when ordering an entree. this restaurant is more for people who want to shell out a little bit of cash to enjoy something <mark>Uni</mark>. four of us ordered a total of 6 items and then mochi ice cream for desert. \n\nthe service was really on top of everything. our waiter knew the menu and was able to tell us what was in every item we asked, and told us what to expect from the restaurant's style of cooking. he came around periodically to make sure everything was okay, and just did a perfect job.\n\ni would definitely recommend people to try this place at least once. it is a little on the pricey end, but it is worth the quality of food that you receive.",

            "my girlfriend and i stayed at the venetian and came here after watching cirque du soliel: zarkana at aria on 05-11-14. i found this restaurant on yelp before we came. i absolutely love sushi and she hates it. we both love texas de brazil so i figured a good compromise would be a churrascaria crossed with a sushi bar so we picked sushi samba. i always like to find the most expensive roll at sushi bars and try it so i picked the s\\u00c3o paulo for $24. it had <mark>Scallop</mark>, masago, red onion, tuna, salmon, shrimp, yellowtail, avocado, truffle, hacho miso soy, chive oil inside. to be honest the red onion over powered the flavor of every other ingredient and kind of ruined it for me. this is coming from someone that loves onions too. if i come back i'll probably ask them to cut that out when i order. i also ordered a generic <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> roll. for our two sharable sides we ordered <mark>Purple Potato Mash</mark> and <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark>. the two sides were the best thing at this restaurant. the <mark>Purple Potato Mash</mark> had a rich buttery taste and creamy texture that melted in my mouth. the <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark> had a perfect amount of sweetness and the texture was lightly firm just the way i like. the real downside of the meal though is that my girlfriend decided to order the <mark>Berkshire Pork Belly</mark> rather than the <mark>Lamb Chop</mark> she was thinking about. i asked if she was sure she wanted that and she said yes. i neglected to mention to her that <mark>Berkshire Pork Belly</mark> is literally a seared section of fat. she was not pleased, but didn't want to order anything else when her food arrived. my girlfriend was actually quite content with the <mark>Purple Potato Mash</mark> and <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark>. overall the experience was pretty good except for the group of 3 drunk russian speaking call girls (assuming) seated next to us that were intent on yelling over the music the entire time they were there instead of leaning in to hear one another. but, hey if you aren't hearing a drunk person screaming in another language next to you at most of the places you're at then you aren't experiencing vegas the right way. ha!", 
            "we came to sushisamba for my birthday dinner a few days ago and i was blown away by the food! it definitely exceeded expectations.\n\nthe menu was so overwhelming we didn't know where to even begin and while our waiter didn't really help us narrow things down, he did make some good suggestions and helped us pace out the meal so we can order as we go. he came with the manager, who was very nice and gave us birthday shots, and also asked that we let him know if he could do anything. \n\nhere's what we started with: shishito peppers combo (grilled shishito peppers, tempura string beans with a truffle aioli, and edamame), <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark> in a spicy mayo sauce, <mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark>, and <mark>Crispy Hokkaido Scallop</mark> lettuce wraps. the peppers were a good surprise of the night because i didn't expect it to come with the string beans and edamame, but i definitely appreciated the greens in vegas! the <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark> was really tasty, but i wish it was a little crunchier when it came out. they tasted a bit soggy as if they were sitting in sauce for too long, but no complaints because the flavor was still there. the <mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> was good, but nothing really mind-blowing in my opinion. the <mark>Crispy Hokkaido Scallop</mark> lettuce wrap was phenomenal. our waiter said it was a new item on the menu and suggested we try it and it really blew us all out of the water. \n\nwe followed up the first round with the robata - we got the <mark>Berkshire Pork Belly</mark>, rib eye, <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>, and duck. all of them were so good, so make sure you pay a visit to the robata section when you visit! the duck and the rib eye to me stood out more than the others - they were cooked very well and had a good mix of <mark>Uni</mark> flavors.\n\nwe finished off dessert with their 4th of july special (red velvet cheesecake, frozen blueberries, and white chocolate ice cream) and sadly we were underwhelmed with what came out. i think we were so blown away by the entire meal, we felt like dessert was going to continue the streak, but were left wanting a bit more. either way, we were so stuffed it didn't matter and the dessert didn't take away from how much we liked the meal itself.\n\nwhat really set this over the edge is that the chef came out to shake our hands and chat with us really quickly, which i really appreciated! the service was great, the recommendations were on par, and the food was delicious. i would definitely recommend this spot for a special occasion - go ahead and gorge!!", 
            "went to vegas to celebrate 29th wedding anniversary. went late at night around 11pm after peak crowds. they close at 1am. our waiter michael d was great at explaining the menu.  the <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> was great and just melts in your mouth. i enjoyed the <mark>Berkshire Pork Belly</mark> ramen (spicy). service was great by everyone. i inquired about cold sake and he offered dewazakura dewasansan junmai ginjo. it has a light and subtle fruity flavor. very nice. he topped our evening off with a nice chocolate cake topped with ice cream in a maple syrup. delicious. we will definitely back.", 
            "i am soooo happy we found this place. the flavors were fresh, the colors bold, the plating beautiful. really its a light happy kind of full. we tried the yellowtail sashimi ceviche, the lima samba roll, the <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> anticuchos, the <mark>Berkshire Pork Belly</mark> robata, and the mango tres leite. soooooo happy my favorites were the yellowtail ceviche it had a perfect little bite to it, just the right amount of heat and the lima roll was almost like butter in your mouth.", 
            "everything here is delicious. almost minus one star for not really having salmon belly. hamachi belly and real wasabi root definitely worth it. the yellowtail tacos is small but refreshingly great. <mark>Berkshire Pork Belly</mark> always awesome. the <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> miso very well flavored, highly recommend.", 
            "i give <mark>Crispy Hokkaido Scallop</mark> 5 stars, rainbow hexagon roll 4.5 stars and 5stars for the sashimi. but we waited for the <mark>Berkshire Pork Belly</mark> ramen for at least 30 mins. while we were still eating the waitress placed our bill on our table. so rude!! stone <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark> tastes weird and is not the regular fluffy crispy tempura i've seen before. pricey. ewwwwwwwww i gave them a minimum of 15%tip. i wish i could give them 0 dollars tip.", 
            "delicious food and awesome service.\n\ni had the spicy lemongrass ramen, <mark>Tuna Tataki</mark>, lamb robata, <mark>Organic Chicken</mark> robata, yellowtail tacos, <mark>Coconut Rice</mark>, anago nigiri, unagi nigiri, and <mark>Sao Paulo</mark> sushi roll.\n\nall of the food were delicious! this place is a fusion of japanese, peruvian, and brazilian. most of the portion sizes were tapa style,so you gota order several dishes.\n\nthe ramen was well flavored with the spices. the noodle itself were ok, but all of the veggies and <mark>Berkshire Pork Belly</mark> were soaked in the broth, which made them all taste delicious.\n\ni don't have much complaint, maybe i can go without the tacos and chicken robata. you have to try the lamb because it's super tender and well flavored. the portion is slightly bigger, but order more if needed.\n\nrolls were small, but it's cute and has plenty of fish to rice ratio.\n\ni would come back again!", 
            "sushi samba in las vegas is always a favorite, and my wife and my dinner there last night was another spectacular experience. the food, service, and decor are always top notch. the usuals  (all four tiraditos, tuna taquitos, samba tea, waygu gyoza, miso butterscotch <mark>Berkshire Pork Belly</mark>, aji amarillo chicken robata, ceviche, and <mark>Neo Tokyo</mark> roll) were mind blowing.",

            "once again, a ny restaurant that i got to try in vegas ;)\ni made reservations here for my hub's b-day and we had a decent time, though we had a few misses. firstly, our server seemed either stoned or passive aggressive, with a general lack of enthusiasm, so his energy kind of brought us down a little! second, the food is good but not amazing. the papas a la huancaina were mini fingerling potatoes, which were kinda random and would have been better if served as french fries, in my opinion. our sushi roll was delicious (la lima, i believe), however, and i should have known better to order more sushi than other choices. instead, i ordered a seafood dish with dende oil and rice that was literally inedible - super oily and cloying, and had a very starchy, almost bitter taste. gross - i'm cringing as i write this. my husband ate his butterscotch miso <mark>Berkshire Pork Belly</mark> dish up - since i'm not a fan of <mark>Berkshire Pork Belly</mark>, i passed on it, but he said it was great. all in all, i would go back and go omakase, and just let the chef do their sushi thing, since clearly it is their specialty! i would also want to try the sashimi taquitos, so we will have to try sushisamba again. otherwise, they have a cool vibe and it feels kind of like a tropical club inside, and who doesn't appreciate a theme?", 
            "i'm always a little skeptical of asian fusion cuisine, but this place does it right! our waitress was very helpful in guiding us through the menu, pointing out the more popular items. it is a \"tapas\" style menu, the plates are small and meant to be shared! we ordered: \n\n-<mark>Seared W<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> Beef</mark> gyoza: i think this was the best thing we ordered! the beef was soooo good and i loved the sauces on the side. \n\n-<mark>Berkshire Pork Belly</mark> ramen: everything in the ramen was very traditional, but the broth was very different from your typical bowl. it had a hint of lemongrass and some heat, which my boyfriend and i really liked (it kind of reminded us of tom yum soup). \n\n-<mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> and shrimp skewers: both came with a side of <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark>! so yummy! these are supposedly the two most popular of the anticuchos. \n\n-lima roll: a pretty standard <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark> roll. i would have rather tried another one of their small plates or tempura instead. \n\nbetween two people this was more than enough food. overall, a really great and satisfying meal with <mark>Uni</mark> flavors!", 
            "sushisamba. oh my gosh. when can i go back again?\n\nthis was one of the best meals i think i have had in my entire life. the type that makes you say \"i don't care how many calories this is, i would gladly get fat for you.\" or, is that just me? okay then.\n\nmy boyfriend and i visited sushisamba on the suggestion of the concierge at the wynn. we wanted something that was moderately priced for a nice dinner, but not too expensive, and something \"exotic\" - not american, italian, or mexican. we were looking for a <mark>Uni</mark> dining experience without being too fancy. sushisamba hit the nail on the head.\n\nour appetizer rainbow sushi was one of the most wonderful things i have ever eaten. we had potsticker-type pork deliciousness that i don't even know what it was called, and then we had a <mark>Berkshire Pork Belly</mark> entree which we split. i realize that i am not being very specific about what we ate, because all i remember was how freaking good it is and my mouth is watering at the thought.\n\nour dessert.. oh my goodness, our dessert. pumpkin donuts with a cream cheese glaze sauce. and it's not even fall - this white girl was in heaven.\n\nsushisamba is a new favorite, and i hope it is a favorite for a very long time to come.", 
            "i've stayed at the venetian/palazzo a dozen times and had never eaten at sushi samba. what a terrible mistake i've made all these years. looking for a restaurant in the hotel for our bachelor party, we decided upon sushisamba due to the variety of dishes, the vibrant atmosphere, and positive word of mouth reviews. we made a reservation through opentable, and were promptly seated upon arrival.\n\nsamba proclaims to have the most extensive sake selection in vegas, and we let our server choose a cheaper bottle for us and it was delicious. \n\n1) japanese a5 <mark>Seared W<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> Beef</mark> gyoza (4.5/5) - you get 5 delicious pot stickers with quality beef that just melts in your mouth\n\n2) yellowtail taquito (5/5) - there are two mandatory dishes to get and this is one of them. essentially a mini taco with yellowtail, roasted corn miso, and avocado. the explosion of flavor was mind-numbingly good and even friends who don't enjoy seafood loved this\n\n3) yellowtail sashimi (4.5/5) - 4 slices of high quality yellowtail, the sauce is delicate and sour\n\n4)  <mark>Berkshire Pork Belly</mark> (3.75/5) - i am admittedly biased towards <mark>Berkshire Pork Belly</mark> so i loved the dish. the butterscotch miso on top was a little overwhelming but the <mark>Berkshire Pork Belly</mark> itself was cooked to perfection\n\n5) <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> anticucho (5/5) - this is the other mandatory dish. we were very for<mark>Tuna</mark> because the table next to us came 15 minutes after and they ran out of this dish! the <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> skewer is  their signature dish and deservedly so. two skewers of <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> cooked so perfectly (soft on inside, slightly crispy exterior), there aren't enough superlatives to describe how delicious it is. \n\n6) <mark>Rio Grande</mark> (4/5) - from their churrasco menu, includes three types of meat: ribeye, chorizo, and w<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> picanha. i would not suggest this if you are eating by yourself or with another because it is just so much meat. in a larger group setting, i think this dish is perfect to share. the w<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> picanha is my favorite because the meat was so soft and tender.\n\nquite simply, i loved my experience at sushisamba. the service was fantastic. the food was <mark>Uni</mark> and delicious at the same time. the atmosphere embodies that of vegas- vibrant and exciting. the price of the dinner was what i'd expect from a \"strip\" restaurant, so be prepared to spend at least $50. \n\ni can't wait to go back to sushisamba for some yellowtail tacos and <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>.",

            "having been to their sister establishments; china grill co, i had high expectation for this place.  i am a huge fan of asian fusion anything.  i would give this place 5 except for the small tables we were sat at.\n\nthis place was extremely busy with your <mark><mark>Osetra Caviar Imperial 20g</mark> 20g</mark> down tempo music playing.  it has a huge projector screen displaying various images of sport or anime.  we made rsvp and got seated within 10 minutes.  \n\nhere we go, the host sat us right by the server isle between the entrance and the kitchen, not impress and not off to a good start.  after getting bumped several times i asked to be moved.  then they moved us to a table that was so close to another couple that we might as well been sharing the bill.  there was no room to move.  i told my girl to wash her hands first before sitting down because we have to pull the table out and asked the people on both side to excuse us.  so far, even worse start.  \n\nnow the food, we were told that the portions are small, so be prepared to order a lot and to damage the amex.  we asked for some recommendation from our server whom by the way was absolutely excellent and was there for everything we need.  he even apologized for the tomato can seating we were in.  we ordered the tuna taquitos which was <mark>Uni</mark> with taste and textured - 5.00 per pc.  we had the yellow tail carpaccio with yellow sauce - 18.00 for 5 pcs and worth every penny. i had the <mark>Filet Mignon</mark>,small and pricey but again worth it.  jennifer had the <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>, again soft and <mark>Uni</mark> flavors, we also had the <mark>Lamb Chop</mark> from the robata and it is the best <mark>Lamb Chop</mark> i had recently.  we also had a few rolls as well, small but delicious.  for desserts we had the donut holes dipped in melting chocolate.  again,the great taste!!!  \n\nthe service is impeccable, even with small tables, the drinks were <mark>Uni</mark> a bit soft, but the flavors were remarkable.  the portions are extremely small, but again, the taste are <mark>Uni</mark> - japanese with brazilian.  the table next to us were from europe (whom thought this place was as of value, i guest that what happens when you get a euro into a dollar; instant discount) recommend we try the sampler menu - 80.00 per person but 7 courses. the server did too.  the next time we will since we did spend over 200.00 there.  \n\nsushi samba is now my top 5 places to eat at, we can't wait to go back there in a few months.", 
            "this place was really super, really great, a little pricey, and really fun.\n\nnow, i'm not a foodie. i can hang with the foodies, understand the lingo and know mostly what they talk about, but i just like to eat. i like to enjoy my food in the more primal sense - eat it, love it, and try to eat more of it.\n\nso it was here that my lovely and i came to have our first meal of our trip in vegas. i like peruvian and brazilian, she likes fish and asian, so hey... bada bing.\n\nwe did a sort of taster/small plates menu, from some sushi, a <mark>Lamb Chop</mark> which i will call the worlds best. peruvian maize which were the size of freaking lima beans, but oh so good, and... well.. truth be told i can't remember all what else. there was some sort of ceviche deal, but after a few donq mojitos, and a lot of drinking that night, i can barely recall all that was had.\n\nbut from what i do remember, it was really really good. sure, it's a fusion restaurant and they either go really really great or you leave less than impressed, but this place really left a good impression on me. the service was wonderful, the exotic drinks weren't too sickly in my opinion, and the decor, ambiance, service, and wait were rather agreeable (especially after having driven for 5 hours that day)\n\nprices weren't shockingly \"brb, need to hit the craps table for a few rolls\" high either.\n\nreally good if you're looking for some sort of asian/south american style cuisine.", 
            "more of a 3.5...  although i love trendy, high ceiling restaurants that give you a modern feel..sushi samba's decor is a little too cluttered for me. maybe its because of the fact that its a twist between brazilian, japanese, and peruvian cuisine...where they feel like they need to include all three of the cultures art.. but whatever the case may be, theres just.. too much orange swirls, too many funky paintings, and too many weird faces on their walls. i like more of the simple trends. they play trendy music..which is a plus...but they crank it up as if you're in a club which in turn makes everyone talk louder than usual. it's almost as if you're in a convention. \n\n\nsome of the items that i've tried and have a vivid memory of:\n\n-yellowtail sashimi tiradito. tasted like...yellowtail in salsa. it was good..but it was different. i usually like my sashimis in ponzu sauce.\n\n-mushroom toban-yaki is reallllly good. it comes out in a hot sizzling clay pot with like four of five different kinds of mushrooms. \n\n-<mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> taquito\n\n-robata: \n<mark>Filet Mignon</mark>\n<mark>Lamb Chop</mark>\n<mark>Cherry Tomatoes</mark>\nshiitake mushrooms\n\noysters, uni sashimi. \n\noverall, its not too bad. i like the convenience. the two times i've been here was because i stayed at the palazzo. takes like 5 mins to get here from our room.",

            "my girlfriend and i stayed at the venetian and came here after watching cirque du soliel: zarkana at aria on 05-11-14. i found this restaurant on yelp before we came. i absolutely love sushi and she hates it. we both love texas de brazil so i figured a good compromise would be a churrascaria crossed with a sushi bar so we picked sushi samba. i always like to find the most expensive roll at sushi bars and try it so i picked the s\\u00c3o paulo for $24. it had <mark>Scallop</mark>, masago, red onion, tuna, salmon, shrimp, yellowtail, avocado, truffle, hacho miso soy, chive oil inside. to be honest the red onion over powered the flavor of every other ingredient and kind of ruined it for me. this is coming from someone that loves onions too. if i come back i'll probably ask them to cut that out when i order. i also ordered a generic <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> roll. for our two sharable sides we ordered <mark>Purple Potato Mash</mark> and <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark>. the two sides were the best thing at this restaurant. the <mark>Purple Potato Mash</mark> had a rich buttery taste and creamy texture that melted in my mouth. the <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark> had a perfect amount of sweetness and the texture was lightly firm just the way i like. the real downside of the meal though is that my girlfriend decided to order the <mark>Berkshire Pork Belly</mark> rather than the <mark>Lamb Chop</mark> she was thinking about. i asked if she was sure she wanted that and she said yes. i neglected to mention to her that <mark>Berkshire Pork Belly</mark> is literally a seared section of fat. she was not pleased, but didn't want to order anything else when her food arrived. my girlfriend was actually quite content with the <mark>Purple Potato Mash</mark> and <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark>. overall the experience was pretty good except for the group of 3 drunk russian speaking call girls (assuming) seated next to us that were intent on yelling over the music the entire time they were there instead of leaning in to hear one another. but, hey if you aren't hearing a drunk person screaming in another language next to you at most of the places you're at then you aren't experiencing vegas the right way. ha!"

            "more of a 3.5...  although i love trendy, high ceiling restaurants that give you a modern feel..sushi samba's decor is a little too cluttered for me. maybe its because of the fact that its a twist between brazilian, japanese, and peruvian cuisine...where they feel like they need to include all three of the cultures art.. but whatever the case may be, theres just.. too much orange swirls, too many funky paintings, and too many weird faces on their walls. i like more of the simple trends. they play trendy music..which is a plus...but they crank it up as if you're in a club which in turn makes everyone talk louder than usual. it's almost as if you're in a convention. \n\n\nsome of the items that i've tried and have a vivid memory of:\n\n-yellowtail sashimi tiradito. tasted like...yellowtail in salsa. it was good..but it was different. i usually like my sashimis in ponzu sauce.\n\n-mushroom toban-yaki is reallllly good. it comes out in a hot sizzling clay pot with like four of five different kinds of mushrooms. \n\n-<mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> taquito\n\n-robata: \n<mark>Filet Mignon</mark>\n<mark>Lamb Chop</mark>\n<mark>Cherry Tomatoes</mark>\nshiitake mushrooms\n\noysters, uni sashimi. \n\noverall, its not too bad. i like the convenience. the two times i've been here was because i stayed at the palazzo. takes like 5 mins to get here from our room."

            "talk about a hidden gem. this place is nestled deep within the palazzo shops, but don't let that stop you from going as it is definitely worth the trek. on our recent visit here, we had a variety of sushi and grilled items and everything was excellent. some highlights: \n\nshishito - nicely charred, spicy, drizzled with oil and sea salt. very good. best shishito i've had.\n<mark>Organic Chicken</mark> - a little heavy with the sauce but still a good eat.\n<mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> - yum! both the chicken and the <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> were served on a bed of <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark>, which was very tasty. \n<mark>Rainbow Dragon</mark> roll - nicely crafted roll of fresh eel and avocado with just the right amount of sauce.\nkanpachi - delicious with lots of wasabi.\n\nfor drinks i had the caipirinha--a brazilian concoction--which was not only excellent but also a steal at only $10.\n\ni would deduct a star as our staff failed to mentioned certain items were out of stock after we had ordered them, but i realize this place is very new and they're still getting their act together. i'll definitely come back again.\n\n(my rating scale:\n5-outstanding, sets the standard for others. 4-very good, would bring friends/family here. 3-decent but wouldn't recommend to others. 2-disappointing. 1-a waste of everyones' time.)", 
            "sushi samba has been a hit or miss with yelpers, and here's my chance to check them out!  featuring a special \"election day menu\" with specialty cocktails and cheap appetizers, it was a perfect opport<mark>Uni</mark>!\n\ndrinks on the menu:\n* obamarama (blue) for $11 \"svedka citron, blue curacao apple liqueur, guava, blueberry\" - really good the first time around. pleasant to look at and just tasty-good.  the guys and gals enjoyed this drink.  the second time i ordered it, there was way too much alcohol though, and not in a good way.  a good cocktail should be enjoyable to drink; i passed the second one off.\n\n* maverick (red) for $11 \"pearl vodka, freshly muddled strawberries, orange liqueur, lime, guava\" - served in a martini glass, so a bit more delicate to drink.  pretty tasty as well. i enjoyed it.\n\nbites to eat:\n* shishito peppers ($2) \"grilled spicy peppers, sea salt and lemon\" - they give you a bunch of these peppers on a plate, and it was okay for me.  i tried one and found that to be good enough.  didn't really care for more.\n\n* <mark>Organic Chicken</mark> aji amarillo anticucho ($2) - i found the chicken to be okay, but really enjoyed the <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark> that came with the dish.  that was the best part of it.  our order had one skewer of chicken, but the party next to us had two? hmm... \n\n* spicy crunchy tuna roll ($3) - really good roll!  i liked this a lot and ordered myself another.  i like how they do their spicy sauce here; it's more mayonnaise-based.  and the slight crunch is nice too.\n\n* <mark>Salmon Avocado</mark> roll ($3) - pretty simple roll with just salmon and avocado.  but it was fresh fish and good.  i'm sad i didn't order more.\n\n* mini chicharron de calamar ($3) \"cornmeal crusted calamari with tamarind sauce, tomato salsa & plantain\" - our friend's order came out soggy, so they thought it was gross.  ours had a better crunch on it, so it tasted better.  it wasn't particularly exceptional, it was okay.  i don't remember any plantain in my dish though.  \n\n* japanese chicken wings ($4) \"teriyaki and sesame\" - it's hard to go wrong with teriyaki chicken wings, right?  good, but messy.\n\n* chilled oyster sampler ($4) \"ponzu jelly & tobiko with three oysters\" - really fresh oysters with an interesting ponzu jelly.  we were supposed to get another order before we left, so i missed out on more!  next time!\n\n* mini yellowtail seviche ($4) \"ginger garlic and soy\" - reminded me of hawaiian poke with the dressing.  it was good with the red onions mixed in there, more poke-like than ceviche-like though.\n\n* crispy yellowtail taquitos ($4) \"shiso, avocado, roasted corn miso and spicy aji panca sauce\" \\u00e2\" two different sauces to put over the taquitos, and it was good.  very messy though as it broke apart after the first bite and was dripping all over my hands.  our order came with two taquitos, but when our friend ordered it, he only got one!\n\n* rosca ($9) \"homemade doughnuts with hazelnut chocolate dipping sauce\" \\u00e2\" recommended by our bartender/waitress as her favorite dessert.  four doughnut holes arrived and they were just okay.  disappointing for us, and we wished we had chosen another dessert instead.\n\nwe spent the whole time at the bar because there was standing room only at this event.  so, the girl making our drinks also served us.  she was busy but tried her best to make our drinks were full and our orders were in.  (our drinks were good for the most part except for that second obamarama we ordered.  but hey, some people like more alcohol in their cocktails!)  i had a bigger problem with the kitchen output and their consistency.  with certain orders coming out, sometimes you got two of something and other times you got one.  our friend mentioned that we got more sushi in our order than when he ordered it.  (makes you wonder what happened to the other pieces.)\n\noverall, we had a decent experience at sushi samba.  you definitely can't beat the price and the atmosphere is casual, which is nice alternative at a strip hotel.\n\n3.5 stars.\n\nthey also offer a happy hour (sunday through thursday from 4 to 7 pm, and then a reverse happy hour from 10 pm to close), available in the bar area only.\n\n(pics posted, of course!)", 
            "i've been here several times, and the food keeps me coming back. i love the concept (japanese, brazilian, and peruvian fusion), and the atmosphere is definitely trendy. food is amazing. service tends to be a hit or miss. not too sure why they let their hosts wear flats and flip flops to work either in a multi-million dollar vegas resort... just saying.\n\nmy favorites from the menu:\n- <mark>Green Bean Tempura</mark> w/ truffle aioli (i love truffle)\n- shishito peppers\n- mushroom toban-yaki\n- veggie kun roll\n- <mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark>\n- shiitake mushroom w/ hijiki <mark>Seaweed Salad</mark>\n- coconut soup for dessert. a savory, light, well-balanced dessert\n** before i gave up meat/fish, my faves were the miso-marinated chilean <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>, <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> roll, and <mark>Organic Chicken</mark> and smoked teriyaki skewer. i didn't forget about you guys!\n\nif you want excellent service, request dayn as your server. he is on point, very knowledgable about the menu, and very attentive. did i mention very courteous?", 
            "this restaurant was really crackin when we came on a sat night for a friend's bday dinner.  you'll definitely need reservations for peak times (ie dinner on a weekend).  it's japanese, brazilian and peruvian cuisine all in one.  if you like japanese w/ a twist, this is the spot to go to.  but beware, for some reason, it was really smokey (prob cause of the brazilian meats they were cooking) and overwhelmed the place (i don't think their blower was working that night).  nonetheless, the restaurant has a hip vibe to it and along with that came much pricier menu options.  we had a large party of 10 and ordered quite a few things from the menu, but i'll just mention the ones that made our group go gaga over:\n\n1) chicken teriyaki ~ samba style <mark>Organic Chicken</mark>, <mark>Purple Potato Mash</mark>, aji amarillo, crispy onion - the chicken was to die for esp with the teriyaki sauce along with the <mark>Purple Potato Mash</mark> (yummm)\n2) <mark>Coconut Rice</mark> - a nice twist to rice and vegetarians\n3) <mark>Rio Grande</mark> w/ a choice of three meats (grilled hanger steak, ribeye, pork tenderloin, chorizo, ling\\u00fci\\u00e7a with malagueta pepper oil and chimichurri) - friends had the hanger steak, ribeye, and i think the pork and came w/ a variety of dipping sauces.  let's just say they were very satisfied.\n\noverall, it's a fun place, but gets a bit crazy and hectic.  large parties are better suited for a booth table vs. something in the middle of the restaurant where we were seated (seemed like we were in the way).  they are also well known for having a large saki menu, although we didn't get to try it out that time.  just more of a reason to come back.", 
            "ever since i came here the first time i went to vegas, i've been dying to come back.\n\nthe food is so good!  i thought we just got lucky the first time we came, but as it turns out, everything we've tried on the menu thus far is delicious.\n\nambiance is classy and cool.  it's a nice location within the palazzo hotel with lots of seats.  service was also good, as my water glass was always full despite being very busy on a friday night at midnight.\n\nwe got:\n\n<mark>Moqueca Mista</mark> - shrimp, squid, <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>, coconut milk, roasted cashew, dende oil, chimichurri rice - $29 - http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sushisamba-las-vegas?select=t4jwaobhrbkbp4vr92x4ua#t4jwaobhrbkbp4vr92x4ua\n\nthis thing is the best ever.  creamy thai-style curry taste (hence coconut milk) with the delicate seafood mixed in with bits of crushed cashews, giving the dish great texture.  rice was served within the sauce mixture as shown; the rice soaked up all the sauce, making every morsel divine.  i thought after a while the dish would get too rich-tasting, but somehow i kept gobbling and gobbling until the plate was empty!\n\n<mark>El Topo</mark> sushi roll - salmon, jalape\\u00f1o, shiso leaf, fresh melted mozzerella, crispy onion - $15 (forgot to take a pic; too excited about the <mark>Moqueca Mista</mark>)\n\nvery <mark>Uni</mark> roll with interesting flavors and textures = delicious!\n\nchicken teriyaki - samba style <mark>Organic Chicken</mark>, aji amarillo, <mark>Purple Potato Mash</mark>, crispy onion - $26 (again forgot to take a pic...)\n\nwhen i saw the huge price tag i thought \"wtf?!\", especially for a seemingly simple plate as chicken teriyaki (my friend ordered this one so i had no control).  buttt i'll have to say that it was probably the best teriyaki chicken i've ever had in my life!  super juicy fillets of teriyaki chicken, pan fried (i think) to a crisp.  the sauce was perfect; not too saucy, not too dry, and definitely not overpowering to the dish.\n\nas with all finer dining restaurants, especially on the las vegas strip, i did think the prices were a little inflated.  hence the lack of that final star.  however, probably one of my favorite places to eat while in vegas.  i'll definitely hit it up again on future trips.  they have a good happy hour too (both early evening and late night), so i'll have to take advantage of that next time! :)", 
            "delicious food and awesome service.\n\ni had the spicy lemongrass ramen, <mark>Tuna Tataki</mark>, lamb robata, <mark>Organic Chicken</mark> robata, yellowtail tacos, <mark>Coconut Rice</mark>, anago nigiri, unagi nigiri, and <mark>Sao Paulo</mark> sushi roll.\n\nall of the food were delicious! this place is a fusion of japanese, peruvian, and brazilian. most of the portion sizes were tapa style,so you gota order several dishes.\n\nthe ramen was well flavored with the spices. the noodle itself were ok, but all of the veggies and <mark>Berkshire Pork Belly</mark> were soaked in the broth, which made them all taste delicious.\n\ni don't have much complaint, maybe i can go without the tacos and chicken robata. you have to try the lamb because it's super tender and well flavored. the portion is slightly bigger, but order more if needed.\n\nrolls were small, but it's cute and has plenty of fish to rice ratio.\n\ni would come back again!", 
            "over-priced, over-sauced, and over-hyped.\n\nthey pride themselves on peruvian-japanese-brazilian fusion - all of which i really like on their own. but this combo it tasted more panda express than the promised fogo-de-ceviche-tokyo.  lunch was over $100 for the two of us. neither of us had drinks and we both left a little hungry.\n\ni tried the 'yamato roll' which had <mark>Foie Gras</mark>, gold flecks, and fresh tuna. sounded good, but then to my horror, they slathered teriyaki sauce over the whole combo! \n\ni then ordered the <mark>Organic Chicken</mark> skewer (robata-style) with a side order of <mark>Coconut Rice</mark>. again, the chicken was covered in some sugary yellow..something. and the rice was doused so heavily in coconut..something, that it was nearly risotto.  \n\nthe plain nigiri sushi pieces (salmon, salmon roe, and the tuna handroll) were fine, but not extraordinary. the yellow tail sashimi came waddled in something i can only describe as orange and tasted like plain japanese curry sauce.\n\nat least the decor, like everything vegas, is unashamed and unaware over-the-top, (which i kind of enjoyed) and the service was friendly and prompt.\n\ni just wished this popular vegas spot fused these cultural ideas together better and with a little more subtlety. that's the moment i realized i just used the words 'subtlety' and 'vegas' in the same thought. my bad."

            "i have visited sushi samba twice now and the more look back on it, the more i regret going there. the food there was good (not great), and the prices here are ridiculous. \n\nmiso marinated <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>: the <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> was the sized of my fist (no bigger). the flavors and texture of the <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> was great. i really enjoyed this dish, but for a tiny piece of fish priced at $29. it's not going to satisfy many and one might change theirr mind about sharing because of the small portions. if you want to add a side of rice it will set you back another $5!  \n--- 3.5 / 5 stars\n\nsalt & <mark>Salt and Pepper Squid</mark>: nothing out of the ordinary. portion was small once again. $14 \n--- 2.5 / 5 stars\n\nmaya roll - the sushi itself wasn't that great, but the salsa was quite tasty. $11 \n--- 3 / 5 stars\n\nbobo brazil - probably the tastiest roll here. the addition of kobe beef was great. small portions once again. $17\n--- 4 / 5 stars\n\nas you can see for the price you're paying here, you can easily select another restaurant (especially if you're ok with eating outside the venetian).\n\nif you're staying at the venetian i recommend eating at delmonico steakhouse (bone-<mark>Bone in Ribeye</mark>)", 
            "located in the shoppes at palazzo casino. my original plan was to get some comps redeemed for grand lux cafe (which is a great place as well). to my surprise, i had over 100 bucks available...i don't remember playing in the venetian poker room that much, but oh well. a bigger surprise, they had a long list of places i could use comps at, including steakhouses, and here. this is not the norm for vegas poker rooms. i guess this could be a venetian poker room review as well; they treat their customers very well! so i decided to try this place. \n\ni'm very glad that i did! my waitress isabella was very attentive, thorough, and answered any questions i had. top notch service! the rest of the waitstaff was even friendlier. my table was periodically kept clean, and lots of refills kept coming. \n\ni was expecting to eat regular sushi, maybe a tasting menu. and i never really thought of what the samba part meant. but i looked at the menu and there were lots of options available, fusion-style: from brazilian steaks to <mark><mark>Osetra Caviar Imperial 20g</mark> 20g</mark> rolls. i was in for an unexpected and different, yet very satisfying meal. \n\n-samba tea: this is a must try! i forgot what they were, but they included many different types of ingredients; the result being one of my favorite teas, if not my favorite. \n-bobo brazil samba roll: <mark>Seared W<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> Beef</mark>, brazilian-japanese style...something new and amazing!\n-miso-marinated chilean <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>...so good! one of the best fish i've ever had.\n-20oz <mark>Bone in Ribeye</mark> steak: juicy and delicious. loved the flavor! goes very well with the sushisamba dipping sauces. \n-warm chocolate banana cake (maple butter, banana chip, vanilla rum ice cream)...awesome!\n\nservice: 5/5; food: 5/5!\n\nthis was a <mark>Uni</mark> and awesome dining experience for me. and it looks like there's plenty more to try! thanks sushisamba. i would definitely come back!", 
            "yum!! i always leave ss looking forward to my next visit. the table always enjoys a wide variety of dishes, my fav being the yellow tail with jalape\\u00f1os and lemongrass, lobster tacos, miso <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> and this last visit we tried the <mark>12 Oz Ribeye Tobanyaki</mark> and it was out if this world. even though stuffed one of my friends threatened to order another bowl of the awesome <mark>Coconut Rice</mark> just to not leave an life of the sauce the meat was made in because it had to be eaten.\n\nwe had an extraordinary server that evening but i unfor<mark>Tuna</mark> i can't remember his name!! he reminded us of marky mark in a way.", 
            "i made dinner reservations for a wednesday night during a work convention at the venetian. i arrived first and waited at the bar and got a moscow mule. it's a circular bar that is half inside and half outside the restaurant so it's great when you're waiting for your party to arrive.\n\nwe were seated inside and the ambiance is really lively. it was pretty dark inside but they were really busy for a wednesday night ( but that could be because our entire company pretty much took over the hotel that week). our waiter took out drink, we got the lemon samurai which was really good. i think it had vodka and some citrus notes in it, also a little strong but that's a good thing right? :) \n\nour waiter returned and gave us a thorough breakdown of all the options we had. basically you can order what you want or you can have the chef whip up a meal for you based on your likes and dislikes. we decided to order a bunch of different dishes (they're tapas style btw). \n\nwe started with the otsumami (edamame, tempura green beans, and grilled shishito peppers) which was really good. i liked the tempura green beans (could be cause it's fried lol). we also got the crispy taquitos, salmon ceviche, yellow sashimi tiradito, the <mark>12 Oz Ribeye Tobanyaki</mark>, and the sao paolo roll. most of this was recommended by our waiter and other recommendations we received.\n\neverything came out really quickly actually. and everything was delicious. the taquitos were super good the only thing about them was the shell was really flimsy and practically broke apart when you picked them up. the salmon ceviche was really good and had a nice kick from the jalape\\u00f1os. we had some colleagues that said we had to get the yellow tail tiradito and it was really good! it actually tasted like a dorito lol but i would definitely say to order one of the tiradito dishes. the only hot plate was the <mark>12 Oz Ribeye Tobanyaki</mark> which the table next to us got so we decided to try it and the beef was super tender. \n\nthe service was really great, our waiter was very tentative and knowledgable. my colleague had to ask us what he said after he was done talking because she thought he was so cute lol.\n\nall in all i would definitely come back. i had a great time from the food to the service and right down to the ambiance - my entire experience was memorable. i recommend coming here if you like japanese food with a twist!"

            "talk about a hidden gem. this place is nestled deep within the palazzo shops, but don't let that stop you from going as it is definitely worth the trek. on our recent visit here, we had a variety of sushi and grilled items and everything was excellent. some highlights: \n\nshishito - nicely charred, spicy, drizzled with oil and sea salt. very good. best shishito i've had.\n<mark>Organic Chicken</mark> - a little heavy with the sauce but still a good eat.\n<mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> - yum! both the chicken and the <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> were served on a bed of <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark>, which was very tasty. \n<mark>Rainbow Dragon</mark> roll - nicely crafted roll of fresh eel and avocado with just the right amount of sauce.\nkanpachi - delicious with lots of wasabi.\n\nfor drinks i had the caipirinha--a brazilian concoction--which was not only excellent but also a steal at only $10.\n\ni would deduct a star as our staff failed to mentioned certain items were out of stock after we had ordered them, but i realize this place is very new and they're still getting their act together. i'll definitely come back again.\n\n(my rating scale:\n5-outstanding, sets the standard for others. 4-very good, would bring friends/family here. 3-decent but wouldn't recommend to others. 2-disappointing. 1-a waste of everyones' time.)", 
            "alright, now were getting to the good stuff. \n\nand by \"good\" i mean un-fucking-believable. yea, i said it. unreal. never have i wanted to pick up and move to vegas so much in all of my life, but i'm thinking about it after the dinner i had at sushisamba's new ultra lounge, sugarcane. this is an incredible statement for me because for one, i can only take vegas in small doses, and two, i despise the heat. so having said that you can believe me when i say that i love absolutely everything about sushisamba, the brazilian/peruvian/japanese fusion restaurant at the palazzo. \n\nwhere do i begin?\n\noh yes, holy mary mother of god, i've died and gone to heaven...\n\na friend of mine is the publicist for this new restaurant, as well as the brand spanking new, sugarcane. she hooked up a dinner reservation for me and some friends so that we could celebrate my good friend's birthday in style. upon our (late) arrival we were greeted warmly by the wait staff, as they explained to us that our party would be the very first members of the public to sit down to dinner in their brand new ultra lounge. as we walked through the dimly lit hallway, past the dj booth and dance floor, and into the dining area portion of sugarcane we were immediately taken back by the overall design concept of the space. i\"m gonna do my best to do it justice but i would highly recommend a trip here to experience for yourself because it is just too complex for words...\n\nthe walls are covered with graffiti-style murals of samurais and japanese script, the dance floor has a canvas like screen that wraps around the circular pods that make up the women's bathrooms (see pics) where they project abstract imagery to coincide with the music playing. the dj that night was claudio who i wanted to put in my pocket and take home because the music was just that dope. there are multi-colored glass cylinders that hang from the ceiling and beams of light (see pics) that separate the dance floor from the dining area that change from red to orange to white that create a truly magnificent effect. \n\nthe food and service is on a level that is even harder to explain - it was incredible. our waiter anthony took such good care of us we felt as though we were old friends by the time we left. of course, we were the first to be seated and the last to leave, so i guess if you spend enough time with your waiter (four hours) you begin to feel like family. our sake sommelier was a hilariously funny girl (i forgot her name) and very helpful and knowledgeable when describing our sake selections. we ended up choosing a bottle with gold leaf cherry blossoms there were supposedly good luck if you found them floating in your drink. \n\nour table decided to order the signature sushisamba 7-course omakase ($70 per person) as our dinner selection. anthony asked us if we had any food allergies or other special requests before going back to the kitchen to get our party started. our first course was a selection of appetizers (see pics) which included the kobe beef carpaccio with <mark>Mixed <mark>Wild Mushrooms</mark></mark>, seared ahi tuna on a tiny bed of spinach, and (my favorite) tiny ceviche fish tacos with a chili foam sauce that was amazing! next up was the best snow crab i have ever tasted, <mark>Filet Mignon</mark>, duck, chilan <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> (unreal), grilled tomatoes, fish jowel (i forget what kind) and the most beautiful sashimi plate i've ever seen/tasted. just when we thought we couldn't eat any more came the sushi course. a stand out roll was the kobe beef wrapped roll with (from what i can remember) a <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark>, cucumber and avocado center. as we sat back in our booth contemplating exactly how we were planning on walking out of there, anthony presented the birthday girl with an incredible chocolate fondue plate (see pics) complete with japanese-style sesame rice krispies, japanese cake, homemade marshmallows, and a selection of fruit. there were also mini fruit tacos with both mango and banana, with a chocolate mousse and caram<mark>El Topo</mark>. \n\ndo you see what i'm talking about?????\n\nhere's the rundown....\n\nparty <mark><mark>Assortment of Four</mark></mark>:\nfirst round of cocktails (on the house)\nseveral cocktails to follow\nbottle of premium sake\n7- course omakase dinner for four ($70 each)\nafter dinner cocktails\ndivine dessert platter\n\ntotal bill: approx $600\n\nnot bad i'd say. not bad at all. \n\nall in all, i plan to go back to visit several times over. anyone who stumbles upon this place should consider themselves lucky to be in the presence of such foodie excellence. this dinner made our entire trip, and made for a very, very happy birthday girl. \n\nsushisamba: the wait staff, the owner, the managers, the dj. you rock my rock-n-roll world.", 
            "i fell in love with sushi samba a few years back in new york, so i had to check out the lv location. this time around it was just as good, if not better. i love the lively ambiance, and the service is wonderful. we decided to get the omakase, and my favorite had to be the chilean <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> served with <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark>.  sooooo good.  another favorite was the yellowtail taquitos. they're small but very delicious. the oysters and <mark><mark>Alaskan King Crab</mark> Leg</mark> were extremely fresh, and we also had a plate of sashimi in various sauces. the sauces were all citrusy (i.e. yuzu) and weren't for my taste but good nonetheless. \none drawback: too full for dessert.", 
            "on a hot vegas weekend stay, my bf and i limited our dining choices to the venetian and palazzo (conveniently connected).  we stopped in for lunch without reservations or doing any prior research, except for the two minutes at the entrance perusing the menu.  they had only been open three weeks, so the staff seemed very eager to bring in any and all people.  our server was extremely friendly, trying her best to make us comfortable and answer any questions.  i think she was asian, but she said she grew up in somewhere in south america, and had an indiscernible accent.  she made everything on the menu sound tasty, but we were only looking for a light lunch.  i had the samba blt which was had yummy chunks of lobster, a bit of mayo heat and applewood smoked bacon.  it came with a side of fingerling potatoes with a sprinkling of some kind of cheese on top, which is called \"fries\" on the menu.  the pickles, i did not like - too tart.  i tried everything on my bf's anticuchos combination bento.  the box usually comes with chicken, beef and shrimp, but he requested the shrimp be switched out for the miso <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>.  its sweetness is best taken in small quantities, such as one skewer.  i liked it, but it is probably too sweet for some.  the tuna roll was acceptable.  it's incredibly dark inside, which makes the bright mall atmosphere outside all the more apparent.  i'd like to return for lunch, because i could envision this place being a too much like a noisy nightclub for dinner.", 
            "having been to their sister establishments; china grill co, i had high expectation for this place.  i am a huge fan of asian fusion anything.  i would give this place 5 except for the small tables we were sat at.\n\nthis place was extremely busy with your <mark><mark>Osetra Caviar Imperial 20g</mark> 20g</mark> down tempo music playing.  it has a huge projector screen displaying various images of sport or anime.  we made rsvp and got seated within 10 minutes.  \n\nhere we go, the host sat us right by the server isle between the entrance and the kitchen, not impress and not off to a good start.  after getting bumped several times i asked to be moved.  then they moved us to a table that was so close to another couple that we might as well been sharing the bill.  there was no room to move.  i told my girl to wash her hands first before sitting down because we have to pull the table out and asked the people on both side to excuse us.  so far, even worse start.  \n\nnow the food, we were told that the portions are small, so be prepared to order a lot and to damage the amex.  we asked for some recommendation from our server whom by the way was absolutely excellent and was there for everything we need.  he even apologized for the tomato can seating we were in.  we ordered the tuna taquitos which was <mark>Uni</mark> with taste and textured - 5.00 per pc.  we had the yellow tail carpaccio with yellow sauce - 18.00 for 5 pcs and worth every penny. i had the <mark>Filet Mignon</mark>,small and pricey but again worth it.  jennifer had the <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>, again soft and <mark>Uni</mark> flavors, we also had the <mark>Lamb Chop</mark> from the robata and it is the best <mark>Lamb Chop</mark> i had recently.  we also had a few rolls as well, small but delicious.  for desserts we had the donut holes dipped in melting chocolate.  again,the great taste!!!  \n\nthe service is impeccable, even with small tables, the drinks were <mark>Uni</mark> a bit soft, but the flavors were remarkable.  the portions are extremely small, but again, the taste are <mark>Uni</mark> - japanese with brazilian.  the table next to us were from europe (whom thought this place was as of value, i guest that what happens when you get a euro into a dollar; instant discount) recommend we try the sampler menu - 80.00 per person but 7 courses. the server did too.  the next time we will since we did spend over 200.00 there.  \n\nsushi samba is now my top 5 places to eat at, we can't wait to go back there in a few months.", 
            "this place is sooo good. they have a really nice atmosphere. my friend placed reservation here for my birthday. we got there perfect timing. the waitress and manager are so friendly. service is really good here. now the food, just great. we got the appetizer with salted bean, tempera bean, and grilled jalapeno. the beans taste good. the jalapeno wasn't spicy, but had a very sourish/\"pickle\" taste. it's different. we ordered a samba roll. that was really good. crunchy, tasteful, and delicious. we ordered the tiger shrimp and <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>. both came with <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark>. it was my first time having <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark>. it is good. it's chewy and reminds me of \"sticky\" corn but larger size. the <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> was very good. the meat was soft and sweet and melts in your mouth. it had a teriyaki flavor i thought. the <mark>Shrimp</mark> was very good too. both tasted very fresh, especially the shrimp. it smells like the ocean. we also ordered fried calamari. the calamari has a tangy sauce poured on top with mixture vegetable including good tomatoes and <mark>Sweet Plantain</mark>. they brought out warm banana chocolate cake for me. the dessert is delicious. ice cream and a crunchy chocolate piece on top of warm chocolate cake in syrup with couple strip of fried banana. just delicious. all the food were brought out in a very good presentation. the dishes are pricey. but if you want to eat fresh and good quality food, you should come to this place.", 
            "overpriced!!!!\n\nthis place is waaay overpriced. appetizer size plates for $20 with barely enough food on them to feed a fish. sushi was nothing to rave about....i have had much better at my local sushi joint. spent a lot of money for an empty stomach in the end. sure the place is beautiful with nice decor but would i really pay all that for that food. i think not! \n\n<mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> was the best dish i had...it almost melted in your mouth. i perhaps would return for this dish but at $20 for two kebabs....i would have to think about it. <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> was about the size of half your palm for $20...ridiculous if you ask me. some good flavor but too expensive for me to return. you definitely do not get what you pay for here.", 
            "excellent service from matt who was very knowledgeable of the foreign terms on the menu and made the atmosphere more lively.  he was very patient with the dietary restrictions that my friend had and made great recommendations.  \n\nhighlights were the <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark> which were colossal and meaty.  they disappeared very quickly.  we also shared the <mark>Rio Grande</mark> churrasco.  one of the 3 meats we had chosen were the rib eye which was medium rare and excellent with the red chimichurri dipping sauce (1 of the 4 sauces that came with the dish).  the lobster on the <mark>Samba Strip</mark> roll was the best thing of the dish - everything else was a bit plain and for $20, i don't think i'll be ordering that again. we also had the tasty <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> skewers and topped our dinner off with 3 flavors of ice cream on a plate with a chocolate 'happy birthday' written on it for the birthday girls. the place is a bit pricey but heck, we were in vegas!", 
            "i really liked this place just a couple of things ruined the experience for me. first of all we sat in this tiny tiny table and i could totally smell and almost taste what the couples next to me were eating/order.. i can't even begin to tell you how close we were.. ew.  and i was soo overwhelmed with the menu. but i guess that is a good thing. oh and i did not like the ceviche taco, too smushy for me.\n\nour waitress was amazing, all her suggestions (the <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> and the <mark>Berkshire Pork Belly</mark>) were our faves. \n\nwe also got the sashimi platter, over 14 pieces of sashimi and it filled me up! \n\nthey comped me a birthday cake which was delicious!  this is now on my vegas rotation!",

            "one of my favorite sushi experiences everrrr.  i've been here three times on three different vegas visits and it's always delicious.\n\non the last visit, we opted for a tasting menu for a party of 7.  the waiter was selling it pretty hard and we finally gave in.  pretty glad we did too.  we asked for a lower end menu costing $50-55/head and the kitchen did a superb job.  we were able to taste way more than we would have ever imagined if we were to order a la carte.\n\nedamame\n<mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark> - (must get)\nyellowtail seviche taquitos - (yum!)\nyellowtail w/ jalapeno and lemongrass taradito (this is the best one)\nkanpachi w/ yuzu sea salt and black truffle oil taradito \ntuna w/ granny smith serrano and lime taradito\nsalmon w/ orange and miso taradito\n<mark>Filet Mignon</mark> robato w/ 4 kinds of sauteed mushrooms (yuuum)\nchilean <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> w/ miso sauce anticucho w/ <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark> (giant corn-delicious fish)\n<mark>Neo Tokyo</mark> roll\ngreen envy roll\n<mark>El Topo</mark> roll\npacific roll\n<mark>Rainbow Dragon</mark> roll\n\ndrinks  - overall they have pretty good drinks, and if you are clever enough to score some 2 for 1 coupons, it's worth it!  i like the samba juice and the lemon samurai. :)", 
            "it would've been 5 stars but the waitress was bitchy at first!\n\nbeing a huge sex and the city fan, i had to go to this place.  the decor is captivating and the lighting is perfect.  red is the dominant hue of the restaurant and it is so pretty.   the location in ceasars is kind of hidden so we stumbled upon it.  we went at the perfect time, right around 3 or 4 and it was not busy.  however, the place got packed!  they decided to put a row of 6 or 7 tables extremely close together so you feel like you are having dinner with complete strangers on either side of you.  you can hear their entire conversation, by the way.  just entirely too intimate for me.  \n\nour visit started out kinda rocky.  our waitress lacked time management skills and/or waited on the other tables hand and foot because she thought they would give them a bigger tip, maybe? dont know!  all i do know is that we sat there for 25 minutes with nothing more than a hello.  so after compaining to another waitress she finally came around.  while we were ordering, our server was more than eager to answer all of my hyper active, anxious and indecisive friend.  \n\nthe menu is a combination of pervian, brazillian and asian fusion.  oooooh so divine!  it was so hard to decide on what to choose.  we finally decided on sushi and <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>, <mark>Miso Soup</mark> and <mark>Seaweed Salad</mark>.  the miso is delicious but i've had better.  my friend ordered the red wild mushroom and truffle miso.  it was sooooo delicious!  but, the <mark>Seaweed Salad</mark> is a must have to veggie lovers.  seaweed has a distinct taste of it's own but it is sooo friggin good!  i was so pleasantly surprised.  when to food arrived, i was like a kid in a candy store.  i cannot remember what sushi i ordered but one of them the best ever!  as expected, the food is expensive.   between the 2 of us, it was well over $100. so don't go here if you are trying to save money.  if you do just order the tapas on the left side of the menu.  but, you will still be hungry.\n\ni loved this place.  with the exception of the servers lack of time management skills at first, this was one of my favorite visits on this trip.  i will be going back!  i love sushi samba!!!!!!!", 
            "we stayed at the venetian and palazzo over the weekend. it took us about an hour to decide on which restaurant in the palazzo to dine at....because man are the restaurants super pricey. since we had friends that had to catch a flight we had to eat in the palazzo so we decided on this place for a group of 9.\n\nthis place blends japanese, brazilian, and peruvian cuisine....while it sounds like a great idea (never heard of such an asian fusion combo)....i think this place tries way to hard to be different. the only thing that i really liked was the grilled <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>....super yummy but it still was $16 for two mini skewers. it came with <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark> which sounded interesting....but turned out to be huge corn kettles that tasted like buttered lima beans....yucko!!! as far as the sushi i tried about 5 of the 10 rolls they had. wasn't too impressed with any of them. they looked pretty and all....but weren't so yummy. i tried a few other dishes too....it just seemed like they were blending <mark>Uni</mark> flavors that just didn't blend well together. the few things preventing me from giving this place 2 stars was the great service (note: they do get 20% tip for groups.....so i do expect top quality service), cool ambiance, and hot guys. check out the break down below:\n\n2 stars - food (overall disappointing)....except for the<mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> \n2 stars - price (expect to pay $40 - $100 per person if you want to get full)\n2 stars - portions (i left still a bit hungry)\n4 stars - atmosphere\n5 stars - service (really friendly waitress)\n5 stars - hot workers!!! (seriously...do you have to be a model to work here....there was lots of eye candy dressed in all black)\n__________________________________\n\njust 3 stars all in all....overall don't really recommend it here if you are strapped on cash....ur probably better off at a buffet on the strip if you wanna get your money's worth. but if you have money to blow....this is a happening place.", 
            "this first time i had sushi samba was in miami last year. i had no idea there were several restaurants throughout the us. i was in vegas last weekend and we decided to eat at sushi samba in the palazzo. the menu was significantly different than the lunch menu at the miami location. not only was it different, it was significantly better! i was not dissapointed with the chilean <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> that i had for dinner. it was marinated in miso and accompanied with veggies. superb and perfectly  cooked. we also started off with tempura and the unagi and copeira rolls. yummy!!!!  the salad we also ordered was a large portion...enough to feed all four of us.\n\ni was able to taste test all of my friends food as well and theirs seemed just as good as mine!!\n\nthis place is great for a nice dinner in vegas although a little pricey (spent over $220 total on food only, no cocktails) it is definitely worth it to try out of the ordinary and comfortably ordinary menu items. i am such a fan!", 
            "i went here with a bachelorette party of about 7 of us.  none of us had been here before and didn't know what to expect.  we made dinner reservations, but still had to wait a bit to get our table.  once we got in... the server was definitely hospitable, gracious, and informative - i only wished i remembered his name to give a shout out. he informed us of the type of restaurant sushi samba was, which is a fusion of japanese, brazilian and peruvian.  we all weren't sure of what to get so he suggested we do a \"tasty menu\" which i think was the omakase (on the website menu).  this allowed us to try the different types of food the menu had to offer.  we let him know what we liked and what we didn't like and he informed the chefs and they brought out a plethora of tasty treats that was enough for 7 of us.  it started off with some appetizers, such as the otsumani ( an assortment of edamame, tempura green beans and shishito  - spicy peppers.... absolutely delicious!) and an assortment of other appetizers that i can't remember.  we then had a n array of seviche.  after that we had different types of meats on skewers and then topped off the evening with sashimi and sushi rolls.  one thing, we were all in awe of the food , we could hardly remember what everything was.  a huge highlight of the dinner was the yellowtail seviche! an absolute delicious delight.  another overwhelming mouth watering treat was the chilean <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> on skewers with <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark>.  i believe we also had the <mark>Samba Strip</mark> roll at the end of the meal which was thoroughly mouth quenching!  we all sat back after the meal and were all very happy and pleased with this establishment and all said how we were going to have to come back there every vegas excursion we go on.  it is a bit pricey.. but i think the food is worth the $$$$.  on top of all that, the atmosphere was definitely pleasing as well as the music which kept me moving in my seat all night.  this place is well worth the 5 star rating and worth the $$$$!", 
            "foodie orgasms is all i can say about this establishment. i am friends with the managers at the southbeach location so when i went to go hang out with a friend in sin city i decided to pull rank and get some first class service knowing full well i was gonna lose money on the tables. \nyeah i lost money but wasnt disappointed one bit at the sushisamba location at the palazzo hotel. i will avoid mentioning having to drop a former friend from ruining my dinner right b4 it started but as soon as i got to the location which i must say is unbelievable and by far is the best designed sushisamba, a close second will be the now defunct location in dallas at the galleria mall. i felt like a kid when i entered the restrooms. i had a nice corner to myself and the hostess was kind enuff to keep me company since i got jilted by a former friend (which i refuse to talk about).  \ni got ala carte type service and even the chef, jose came out to greet me and making me feel special cos he remembered me from the southbeach spot. the taquitos were incredible i had the yellow tail and the lobster one. i decided i was only going to do small plates so i ventured to the anticuchos and ordered the chicken liver which just melted in my mouth and made vegas worthwhile and followed by the chilean <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> that the hostess recommended. for my drink i always get their caiprinha which is like a brazilian mojito and was on point.\n\nnow i was getting full but the chef surprised me with a kobe beef plate which was sushi <mark>Grade A5</mark> once again splendid and lest i forget i also ordered the <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark> for my side which is ridiculously tasty. \n\nthere were several groups in town for bachelors parties and partying in general and the decor just made the groups blend in and make it very private. \n\nwill definitely be back", 
            "i was in vegas last weekend, and rolled out of bed at 11am on saturday with a craving for sushi.  i recalled having had a tasty sushi meal in the venitian canal shops a few years back, so my wife and i headed over there looking for the place.  we ended up at sushi samba in the palazzo shops, which was not the place i remembered but certainly a pleasant experience.  i had always known that south america had a decent population of japanese people, but had never been anywhere that attempted a fusion of japanese and south american cuisine.  it totally works, and the restaurant was beautiful inside.\n\nthe sushi was excellent.  we tried the chef's selection which came with a nice assortment of tuna, salmon, yellowtail, and shrimp.  we also tried one of the south american dishes - miso <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> skewers with <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark>.  i had never had anything like it and it was amazing.  in the end the bill for those items plus a few more and a couple of beers came to just over $100, but well worth it.  \n\ni would highly recommend this place, and would also recommend you try it for lunch instead of dinner.  at midday there were only a handful of people there and the service was excellent.", 
            "i think the reason why i put off this review for 2 months is that i've been afraid of not praising this place enough with what i'm about to say in a couple of lines. first of all, thanks to my procrastination, i've forgotten the incredibly friendly manager's name who treated us newly legals to 3 chu-cumber shots, which, btw, go down ridiculously well. (maybe his name was anthony...?) anyway, he also hooked us up with a bouncer at tryst and we got in without having to wait! so the staff and their service is really really amazing. i'm pretty positive if you go there (soon), there will still be this omg-drool-with-my-eyes-like-it's-possible waiter there ready and waiting to fill up your glass of water... or take your order... or ravage - no, that's it. \n\nenough about the awesome service, the food was also really really amazing. it's a brazilian/japanese fusion type restaurant, but i'm not really big on brazilian unless it's like a churascaria, so we went with mainly japanese type dishes. (i mean \"japanese\" in the most non-<mark><mark>Osetra Caviar Imperial 20g</mark> 20g</mark> though) \n\nthe condensed version looks like this and in this order (but all should be had at least once - write it down guys, seriously. prepare yourselves):\nbobo brazil roll\ngreen envy roll\n<mark>El Topo</mark> roll\nmiso marinated chilean <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> (way too small for it's own good.) \n<mark>Neo Tokyo</mark> roll\n\nthis place is pretty pricey, but i've been here 3 times already and i don't intend to stop. i've pretty much made an agreement with myself that i will eat here at least once any time i'm in vegas. \n\n5 stars!! \n\nokay, and i know i mentioned \"condensed version\" earlier which implies a more in-depth explanation to those, but too bad? you're just going to have to trust me. \n\nhappy gambling, happy clubbing, happy eating, and happy samba-ing. :)", 
            "this place was really built by a couple of my friends that couldn't stop talking about it.  i thought it was ok and overpriced, even for vegas standards. there were some great items--<mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> anticuchos and <mark>Berkshire Pork Belly</mark> ramen were my favs of the evening.  the sushi was decent but nothing out of the ordinary for the price.  the mini tacos were good, but just that, mini.  the <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark> was a bust at our table--way too much mayo and 2/3 of the <mark>Seaweed Salad</mark> tasted like nothing.  it prob would have fared better if my expectations weren't so high.", 
            "out of all the restaurants i've been to in vegas, i must say....sushi samba is probably the best one i've eaten at!  \n\nthough the food isn't cheap and the portions aren't big.....everything that i ordered was delicious and well worth the money.  i would recommend everything i ordered for those that are going there.  \nhere's what i ordered for 2 people:\n1) <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> and miso antichucos....the <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark> that comes with it was quite tasty\n2) <mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark>....3 fried tofu, 1 asparagus and 1 mushroom in some sort of sauce.  this was probably the most normal item that we ate on the menu....but it was still good.\n3) bobo brazil samba roll.  this was quite interesting...seared kobe beef roll.\n4)  some sort of <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> roll.  the tuna was high quality...very fresh!\n5) peruvian hot chocolate....this was damn good!  the drink was thick and very creamy.\n6) mango honey crisp taquito.  \n\nthinking of the food makes me drool wishing i could have it again.  \nthe service there was excellent!  waiters clean your table and fill your water before you even have to ask.  they were very attentive and not smothering.\n\nbe aware though...right when you sit down they ask you if you'd like some edamame.  you think this would be free....but you will later find out that you're being charged for it.  \n\nsushi samba is a definite must!", 
            "i'm not a sushi purist, i love the fusion crap :)  i would give them 4 stars but they ran out of <mark>Alaskan King Crab</mark>.  how do you run out of something that makes up the base for many different items/rolls u serve.  we ordered something called the yamato roll which was pretty good except for the fact that it was $19 for 3 pieces.  it was the only roll that didn't have the standard 5-6 pieces.  for that much money i was expecting much more pop.  i love anything with <mark>Foie Gras</mark> so i may have liked the yamato roll more than i should've.  however, if you don't like <mark>Foie Gras</mark> skip it and get something else.  the miso <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> was fantastic just like the waiter described.  what bothers me is that they keep telling you how little the portions are after u order the dish which makes u order it twice or more  if you're with two plus people.  the miso <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> was like $16 for one skewer.  the food is good but be warned if you want to leave full you will spend a lot of money.  good thing it was comped thanks to my buddy.\n\nps  the chef's sushi/sashime does not come with straight sashime.  it was one sushi roll with some nigiri.",

            "sushi samba was the perfect spot to fill up on tasty food after a quick shopping spree at the shoppes at the palazzo with my fashionista girlfriend. we went straight for the $16 chilean <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> bento box, which was the best deal on the lunch menu. it came with <mark>Miso Soup</mark>, <mark>Field Green Salad</mark>, tuna roll and oshinko pickles. \n\nthe three skewers of miso glazed <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>, along with all the sides, was a nice amount of food (though could've been a little small for a big appetite), but i seriously could have eaten three more skewers. the <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> was amazing! that miso marinade was to die for. i suppose i could've gotten the entree portion, but for lunch, it was perfect. plus, $29 is a bit much to spend on a lunch entree. there were six tuna rolls, so that also made the bento filling.\n\nthe funky decor was really cool, and reminded me a little of blowfish in the bay area -- but much bigger and with latin influences intertwined. the staff was awesome, and the food came out quick. we were in and out in a flash, and back to the pool before our guys even missed us.",

            "it is time for me to write my review for sushisamba after all the times i have been to this location. the ambiance in the strip branch is pretty nice. you don't get to mingle with a crowd of people like in their dromo (miami) location but you still get to have a hell of a dining experience. the dining room is pretty dark almost like a nightclub, the music is loud and the drinks are strong. so all in all, this is a supper club.\n\notsumami is a must to have as a starter. the trio of shishito peppers, <mark>Green Bean Tempura</mark> and edamame is the perfect way to start over a round of caipirinhas.\n\nafter this you can do a round of robata. <mark>Filet Mignon</mark>, <mark>Lamb Chop</mark>, chicken, eggplant and <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>, they're all great and some of them come with the huge <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark> which are so tasty.\n\nas for the main course, i have tried their <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> entree which i loved until i had the moqueca. the moqueca is simply the best seafood stew i have ever had in my whole life. it is a medley of shrimp, squid, <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> and crayfish cooked in a pot with coconut milk and cashews.\n\ntop this with more caipirinhas and maybe a couple of their desserts from their expansive dessert menu and you'll have yourself a great dinner right before you head into an endless vegas night... you'll have a great dinner in a great ambiance with great music and on top of it you'll have a little bit of a buzz...", 
            "every year i go to miami for winter music conference i have been lured to go eat at sushi samba over on lincoln but i have never had the chance to eat there. not sure why. maybe it always seemed to packed and i didn't want to wait. i know now that i missed out on some damn good meals.\n\nright before thanksgiving my wife and my father in law traveled over to las vegas for a few nights. as we walked into the venetian hotel i saw a billboard for sushi samba at the adjoining hotel, the palazzo and i knew then where we were going for dinner. we went up to our room, freshened up and headed out.\n\nwe were quickly seated (it was a sunday night and the place was half full) and placed some drink orders. my wife had one of the specialty drinks which was quite good and i had some nigiri sake. we started off with the otsumami appetizer which came with edamame, shishito peppers and <mark>Green Bean Tempura</mark> with black truffle aioli. all 3 were excellent but we found ourselves fighting over the green beans and that yummy aioli. \n\nnext up was a mixture of ceviches and tiraditos. we tried 4 all together with both salmon and yellowtail. amazing flavor. the yellowtail ceviche taquitos were also amazing. i could eat those all day. we also had a couple of things from the robata grill. the stand out was the miso glazed <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>. it was incredible. so tasty. it was the best <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> i have ever had. period! the <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark> that came with it also was quite tasty.\n\nthe waitress recommended the mushroom toban-yaki with some grilled duck from the robata grill. it was so intense and earthy. i definitely got use of those umami tastebuds with this dish. loved every bit. after all that, we saved room for 2 speciality sushi rolls, the <mark>Samba Strip</mark> roll and the <mark>Neo Tokyo</mark> roll. both were amazing and filled with different flavors. \n\nall in all one of the best meais i have had in a while and i have had some amazing meals recently. if in vegas, you owe yourself. do it.",

            "came here on the reccomendation with chef micheal cressoti and i was impressed. it's located at the top floor of the palazzo with a hip and dark ambiance. okay people it's dark crowded and loud. do you forget where you are?!? it's las vegas people!! this is what you should expect. this is the new era where sushi is supposed to be hip. i took my girfriend and a third wheel there for a dinner and pretty much ordered the omakase. as a person who worked around in sushi restaraunts, lived in peru, and surrounded by brazileros, i still was taught i had alot more to learn about the cuisine and the complex flavors on the palate when mixed together. honestly unless you're ordering the kobe beef roll or the fuie gras sushi... skip the whole sushi list. the rolls are great but for the price, i would opt out for the kitchen orders. <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> was a little different but nothing to make you stand up and dance. the red miso <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> (i believe that was the fish) skewers are to die for. the grill is special grill where they use woodchips brought in from japan. this is the kind of special treatment the chefs use to creats such dishes, so the price is reasonable. all their fish is line caught so for the environmentally conscience, expect to pay more for sushi as opposed to other sushi restaraunts. their ceviche was very light and refreshing, so was the yellowtail sashimi and the ceviche. the kobe beef tacos. sorry kogi was okay for me. asian tacos are as good as it gets, but kobe beef tacos who can possibly resist. it was spectacular with the spicy emulsion that was served on the side. the duck confit with wil mushroom is a must order. succulent morsels of variety of mushrooms and the perfectly cooked medium rare breast of duck just melted in your mouth. the sake sommelier was very friendly and knew her alcohol, so if you are interested in ordering sake ask for the pro. from here and there, after 5 other dishes, we ended up with dessert. the chocolate cake, which they said was great, was rather just good, but the carrot cake. i hate carrot cake, but the pastry chef, she whippped up something so magical and delicious. not too sweet, not too heavy, not too bready... if you can understand what i mean, you will love this cake. in a cake, i look for the perfect balance of sweetness and richness, that will just top off your great meal. not to overwhelm your palate and your stomach but make a nice closure to the expensive meal you just enjoyed. it was the best carrot cake i've had. overall the staff was friendly and the general manager was kind enough to explain to me about the food and the kitchen, since i work in the kitchen as well. i left there extremely happy and with an impressed gf and third wheel. thank you sushi samba.",

            "thursday night. 9pm. \nour reservations were honored to the minute and the man who runs the show, mike durovsik, at once made us feel not just like welcomed guests but old friends.\n\nmy fiance and i were indulged with a 9 course specialized server's omakase. the food was superb, and the service exceeds even the best definitions of accommodating. \n\nour charming and attentive server asked immediately how adventurous we were willing to get, and since we had no objections to anything particular, our meal immediately commenced.\n\nfirst was the otsumami, three small dishes: <mark>Green Bean Tempura</mark> with a creamy truffle aoli dipping sauce (incredible), shishito peppers charcoal grilled and just the right amount of spicy, as well as edamame sprinkled with sea salt.\n\nnext came hamachi (yellowtail) tacos paired with a fizzing sort of vinegarette (spicy aji panca) on the side to top it off- this was filled with so much flavour it literally forced my eyes to roll back. a real treat that i'd highly  reccommend.\n\nat this point it was quite apparent that service and timing was top notch. the bottle of sake we brought was being chilled tableside and water never fell below the 2/3rds mark. as the bottle chilled we tasted two different cocktails-  kumori, a cucumber cocktail with shochu and nigori which was refreshing, easy, and delicious.  alongside was the ever popular nina fresa, a strawberry cocktail with vodka. both made for easy, yet yummy drinking.\n\ntheir mushroom toban yaki was divinely creamy- we got ours with bincho tan grilled lamb on top which paired quite nicely with those garlic chips. their were five different kinds of perfectly cooked mushrooms in the mix, and all around it made for a <mark>Uni</mark> filling appetizer. my fiances words: that fu**ing amazing lamb dish ;)\n\nthe sashimi tiradito i'm always raving about came next. still on a midblowing level, i noticed that their are different flavour notes (though served with the same ingredients) for the nyc location and the las vegas one. so if you think you've had it before, you haven't. though different, the fish is always immensely fresh and the taste accents are truly wonderful. my favorite is the kanpachi since i'm a sucker for yuzu (japanese citrus) and my fiance was a big fan of the hamachi- if you're torn, go with the assortment of all four and you won't have any regrets.\n\noff the robata grill (bincho tan charcoal) came the most decadant <mark><mark>Alaskan King Crab</mark> Leg</mark> imaginable- our taste buds were literally in shock from the mastermind talents of chef oscar toro. bedded atop rock salt, the crab was creamy, fell apart smoothly, and the flavours enhanced the entire piece of already fresh seafood. a seasonal dish that may not always be available... so wonderful. if they don't have it on menu, go for the spiny lobster.\n\nalso from from the robata grill we enjoyed the miso glazed <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> with baby corn. again, this dish can be done so many different ways at different high end japanese restaurants- but sushi samba's brazillian take really heightens the tastes.\n\nask for the freshest oysters of the day- you can go with <mark><mark>Osetra Caviar Imperial 20g</mark> 20g</mark>, paired with yuzu jelly and lemon, or a more contemporary take which chef oscar toro will create specially for that oyster.- both ways are unforgettable.\n\nmy absolute favorite dish is the kobe ishiyaki. you grill fresh pieces of perfectly marbleized kobe tableside 3-5 seconds on each side on an extremely hot river stone. you get 4-5 sauces and and array of salts to mix up the taste buds for you- absolutely the most decadently delicious dish. whenever i see this i must have it, and sushi samba's is the best i've had. not enough people indulge in this and you must must must!!! \n\nour sushi/sashimi platter was fresh and wonderful- exquisite. we got the <mark>Neo Tokyo</mark> and the <mark>El Topo</mark> rolls- <mark>Neo Tokyo</mark> has tuna and a bit of spicy to it, and the <mark>El Topo</mark> is served warm- a surprising aspect, but the melted mozzarella is such a <mark>Uni</mark> addition. it's like the movie \"<mark>El Topo</mark>\" you must try/ see both! \n\nfor dessert we went with mochi; a soft and chewy japanese dessert that is <mark><mark>Osetra Caviar Imperial 20g</mark> 20g</mark> not overly sweet. sushi samba adds ice cream to the center and offers all the best flavours. \n\nby the end of our meal and a finished bottle of sake, we were both more than pleasantly buzzed and satiated with an incredible meal. \n\n\n**************\nbottom line, if you are trying to decide between nobu and sushi samba, pass on nobu and put some samba in your seafood!!\n\nthank you again mike and oscar for such a wonderful night!!",

            "you must try the miso glazed <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>.  omg! like butta!! melts in your mouth!! see the pic. the glaze is sweet but not too sweet then bam! you get that soft, buttery, tender-falling-apart-in-your-mouth <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>. \nwe tried the sampler split amoung a group of ladies, but this is the dish. this is the most impressive dish here.  the bathrooms are cool too with grafitti art. the food's ok overall, but it seemed like they served both cuisines more than a fusion of the cuisines.", 
            "amazing food, excellent service, open atmosphere with a trendy feel and even a nice bathroom!  \n\nthere were 7 of us and everyone was happy with their food.  they bring out your food as it is ready, which worked quite well and we did not feel rushed at all.  they also have a fun drink menu. \n\nthe menu has a lot of options for sushi and non-sushi treats.  there is a lot to choose from and it's nice to get a few different things to try.  everyone at the table ordered different things including shrimp, chicken, duck, beef, soup, sushi etc etc etc.  there was not a complaint from anyone, not even the super foodies! \n\ni had the yellowtail tiradito and it was an incredibly flavorful appetizer.   the pacific roll with <mark>Alaskan King Crab</mark>, asian pear and a wasabi-avocado crema was excellent.  it was a generous size and it was different than your typical sushi offering.  \n\ni highly, highly, highly recommend the <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> & miso skewers.  the texture is perfect and the flavor is spectacular!  three of us ordered it and left not a crumb on our plates.\n\ntakeaways?  fast all day.  go to sushi samba in the venetian/palazzo.  drink fun drinks.  order a la carte and enjoy the options.  eat the <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> or you are missing out.", 
            "i've been here several times, and the food keeps me coming back. i love the concept (japanese, brazilian, and peruvian fusion), and the atmosphere is definitely trendy. food is amazing. service tends to be a hit or miss. not too sure why they let their hosts wear flats and flip flops to work either in a multi-million dollar vegas resort... just saying.\n\nmy favorites from the menu:\n- <mark>Green Bean Tempura</mark> w/ truffle aioli (i love truffle)\n- shishito peppers\n- mushroom toban-yaki\n- veggie kun roll\n- <mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark>\n- shiitake mushroom w/ hijiki <mark>Seaweed Salad</mark>\n- coconut soup for dessert. a savory, light, well-balanced dessert\n** before i gave up meat/fish, my faves were the miso-marinated chilean <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>, <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> roll, and <mark>Organic Chicken</mark> and smoked teriyaki skewer. i didn't forget about you guys!\n\nif you want excellent service, request dayn as your server. he is on point, very knowledgable about the menu, and very attentive. did i mention very courteous?", 
            "my opinion/side note - i dont think its their sushi that makes this a good place to eat. but its the dishes that are not other sushi restaurant menus that makes it worth the cost.\n\nthis place is really good, only if you order the right things, because ordering something bad can cost you a pretty penny. i have been here twice and the 2nd time was much better because we all knew what we liked. \n\nthe chilean <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> on the robata grill section was probably my favorite rendition of chilean <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>. our waiter said the robata grill costs $1000 a day to operate? something like that. but wow it was good. you have to order off of this part of the menu if you are a fan of grilled food.\nprobably the only time i felt like a winner in vegas all weekend, just playing, kinda, lol.\n\nthe yellowfin taquitos were so <mark>Uni</mark>, and the foam chili sauce that came with it was the perfect compliment.\n\n<mark>El Topo</mark> - good but not great. table loved it though.\n\n<mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark> with black truffle aoili - if i ever make my dream of opening up a restaurant come true - this will be the first item on the menu. wowwww. it made a shrimp convert out of 1 the people at our table. but really how can u not like shrimp?\n\n\n-p", 
            "this place is amazing! probably one of the best dinner experiences i have had in a while.  the dishes are all so flavorful and beautifully presented.  everything is cooked perfectly. if you go there you have to try the <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> and the kobe beef taquitos. also, the giant <mark><mark>Alaskan King Crab</mark> Leg</mark> were unbelievable!  the atmosphere and service was great! ( isaac was the best!) i would recommend this place to anyone, especially if you love seafood. definitely worth it! i can't wait until i am in vegas again to eat there!", 
            "great atmosphere and awesome service!  \n\nour server was very knowledgeable about the menu and she explained how to order.  she saw the confused look on our face and said \"let me know your preferences, your budget and i'll put together a menu for you\".  we all agreed that was the way to go.  she picked a great combination of appetizers, sides and entrees for us to try along with a large plate of sushi.  we were all impressed with the food choose and were very happy with her selections. \n\nhere are some highlights of the dishes we tried....\n\nthe sashimi taquitos.  lightly friend corn tortilla stuffed with various sashimi with a great salsa.\nthe pork gyoza with a sweet pumpkin sauce.  fricken delicious!\nskewered <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> marinaded in miso.  yum\n\nthose are just a few dishes that stood out for me.  definitely will be back.", 
            "chilean <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> skewers with miso - absolutely delicious!  the <mark><mark>Jumbo Shrimp</mark></mark> with passionfruit ceviche -- original and delightful.  my husband's favorite dish was the <mark>Tuna Tataki</mark> .  we came here because i had a taste for sushi and it was the highest ranked by yelpers.  when we arrived, the bar atmosphere caused us to question the yelp reviews but after eating we agree.  the sushi rolls aren't that great (we tried the <mark>Samba Strip</mark> and <mark>El Topo</mark>) but they weren't horrible.  the servers are familiar with the entire menu so if you don't have a specific taste for something, feel free to ask them for their suggestion. they'll have a ton.  also, their drinks are good but lean away from being sweet.  i had to have them muddle more sugar and mint to flavor up my drink a little more because it just tasted like rum with a little mint when they first brought it out.  this is a tapas place so you can easily order 4 plates per person which can get pricey.  but highly recommend for their chilean <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> skewers.  i haven't had <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> this good since g. garvin's restaurant in west los angeles closed a few years ago.  outstanding.", 
            "i wish we could have ordered more food.  their menu was extensive! \n\nwe were only able to try their ceviche, one sushi roll, seared kobe and these taquitos.  they were all really good! skip out on the lobster taquito though. that was everyone's least favorite.\n\nother than that, had a lovely time here.  food was great.  def. coming back to eat again.  this time, i want to try the <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>, which i was eyeing last time i was here.", 
            "i am writing this review based on what i had. the bobo brazil and the <mark>El Topo</mark> roll was sooooooooo good! they are not huge so you can just pop one piece at a time and it's like heaven in your mouth. all the flavors and textures just worked so well together. i am not a big sushi eater but i would come back here the next time i'm in vegas. the miso <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> was awesome also. i got drunk off of one strawberry mojito cause they made them so damn strong here", 
            "meh. i came here for a bachelorette party dinner with a group of 7 girls. i liked my dish alot (<mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>) but wasn't really feeling any one else's dish. the <mark>Berkshire Pork Belly</mark> skewer was good too but everything else was very forgettable. nothing bad, but nothing outstanding. it's a fun place to go with your friends and the prices aren't as steep as some of the other \"nice\" vegas restaurants. service was great too because they brought out free dessert for the bachelorette without us asking.", 
            "we were staying in the palazzo and really wanted sushi so we came here.\n\ndefinitely get the family style recommendation option. \n\nbasically, you tell your server what you like (like yellow tail, tuna, avocado, pork, miso, etc.) and a budget, and they bring out family style dishes within your budget that they think are matched with your favorite ingredients.\n\nthis was amazing - we wouldn't have ordered many of the things they gave us.\n\ndefinitely ask for some sushi, and definitely ask for miso-braised <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> - this was the best item we had!!!!!\n\notherwise, just let the kitchen do the work for you. the surprise element is great too. if you don't like a dish, the kitchen takes it back with full responsibility too, which is great.\n\nthere's two areas to sit in, the front area near the entrance and the \"sugar cane\" room in the back. we got sat in the latter, and it was much cooler than the front. quieter, a little darker, and more \"exclusive\" seeming than the front.", 
            "i had heard about sushi samba for a while and finally got a chance to try it.  it was definitely worth the try for it's <mark>Uni</mark> blend of south american and japanese flavors.  the meats (kobe) and grilled fish (<mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>) are spot on.  the <mark>Uni</mark> spices and flavors are really good.  most of all, the rolls and sashimi (otoro... drooolllll) were spot on, very fresh and very flavorful.", 
            "i had a sample of the tuna, yellowtail, and salmon in a different sauce and i must say it's quite amazing.  as i enjoy every bite of the fish i tried to dissect the sauce that was delicately woven into the fish; which was rather refreshing.  the <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> miso is also a must try; it's paired with a brazilian corn that was the sized of a penny so big and tasty.  if you like sashimi order the sashimi platter it's a better deal than ordering by the piece. \n\nthe decor is modern and very energetic.  a little of pizazz and lust.  i always adore coming here.", 
            "the atmosphere is cool: like what i imagine some urban japanese hot spot to be, haha. check out the mural on the wall--it'll keep you talking all night! they also had some video projector playing some cool clips on the wall. i loved it and the booths were big and round.\n\ni went here saturday night. at some point they brought out some dancing girls in skimpy outfits. i felt it was a tad out of place and noisy, but somewhat entertaining.\n\ni ordered the nina fresa, this delicious vodka cocktail with muddled strawberries. yum.\n\nour party ordered a lot of things. the <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> skewers were to die for--definitely order some. i also enjoyed the jalapeno yellowtail. it was served with these large brazilian(?) corn kernels. the sashimi was good, too! those were the only dishes i remember. oh, the neo-tokyo roll was super plain and required salty soy sauce to give it any taste. everything was good though, not amaziiiiing.\n\nit's def a schlep to get here from the entrance of the palazzo, but worth it! i had a blast, but wouldn't have enjoyed it if i had to pay (but that's everywhere in vegas, no?).", 
            "if you're in the mood to drop about $500.00 for dinner for three, this is a great place to do it.  the highlights are cooking thin slices of kobe beef on a blazing hot rock, <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> skewers, and the tempura rock shrimp.  food and service is impeccable, albeit expensive.", 
            "these 5 stars goes to the lady who was so damn good at her job by fulfilling every aspect of our dining experience that the food was more like a plus. i wish i got her name to credit her but we were a party of 8 girls staggering in late in high heels for our dear friend's bachelorette reserved dinner on a saturday night a week ago.\nwe got the run down quickly on doing their style of \"omakase\" after mentioning we had a show and had to finish by 9pm. we gave her free rein with a price per person between $30 to $40.\nnow, i was the only one who had been here before for the same concept so i was expecting the same good service and food. so i discreetly asked the lady server to make sure to add the miso <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> skewers. she happily replied, \"i gotchu girl!\" \nwe were then offered the extensive sake and wine menu, which we had to forgo. and one of the girls almost ordered the cucumber martini but didn't.  \nafter the time it took for a buzzed dude to walk over, show us his awesome swim trunks, (clearly forgetting to dress his bottoms to match his sharp shirt), wink and share a charming smile, and then leave...our appetizers were presented by a team of 3 servers.\n- otsumami: trio of edamame, tempura green beans with amazing truffle dip, grilled shishito pepper :)\n- pork gyozas (ok)\n- <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark> (wasn't as succulent or saucy but still good)\n\nour waters were always filled. thank you water guy!\n\nthen after enjoying our appz for about 20 mins, came out the yummiful skewers, 3 specialty rolls of sushi (could have asked for the <mark>El Topo</mark> roll but decided try the others) and an entree split by 2 plates to share. it was the teriyaki chicken with fried onions atop mashed purple potatoes. this is so yum because the chicken was juicy and flavorful!\n\nwe were having our fill and we were on schedule. then the lady server got us a surprise sake tree of their cucumber martini! also very refreshing and yum to end our meal.  we had to pack a bit of to-go and we were happy with the service. she lined our meal down the middle of our price range to about $36/person (plus tax+tip $45).\nso exceeded my last experience here!  i recommend the omakase style because the servers really do know the menu. trust!", 
            "even though it is on the pricier side, it was worth it. my soul was happy with me after i ate here. in fact, my soul asked me to eat twice here. i happily obliged. the first time we were only there for a quick snack and a drink, but the second time we actually ate a meal there, so i'll review the second time. \n\ni should give one caveat: i'm not particularly familiar with authentic brazilian or japanese food. that said, i found this fusion restaurant both intriguing and completely intoxicating. \n\nthe waitress we had the first time was good, but i really remember our second waiter, max. he was very attentive and gave fantastic recommendations, but wasn't pushy about it. most importantly, you can tell he's actually excited about the food. it made a huge difference, because seeing someone so excited to tell you about the ingredients, how the food is prepared, and what flavors are going on together really adds to a wonderful food experience, in my opinion. the waiter ended up recommending a $60 per person meal, a tasting menu of sorts. it sounds like a lot, but given the prices, it was really very fair considering the amount of food we got. as such, i'm not going to talk about every little thing, but more the highlights. \n\nthe <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark> was addicting. it was a little closer to the hominy side of the corn spectrum, but it was buttery and had just a bit of texture. if it doesn't come as a side, i absolutely recommend trying it as a separate side dish. it does come as a side to the <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> skewers, which i think were my single most favorite thing i tried there. it was buttery and delicious, and so flavorful in little bites. i wish i could describe it better than just \"flavorful,\" but i'm not even sure how to describe how delicious it was. i'll just say that while i was eating it, i hoped it would never stop (so inappropriate but i can't help it: that's what she said). \n\nhamachi tacos and a plate of various sashimi were incredible. i liked the sashimi just a little more because the bold flavors of the sauces surprisingly married well with the fish flavor, without overpowering it. \n\nthe most surprising part of the night: there was a sushi roll that included melted mozzerella. yes. mozzerella and salmon. i was so skeptical of this one, and it took me a few tries to get used to it, but once i did, it was like a warm blanket. if you can push aside the weirdness, it's a good roll. \n\nanother piece of fabulosity we had was a yellowtail seviche (they do spell it with an \"s\"). it was tangy but still let the other flavors show, and that is one of the items (along with the <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>) i will absolutely order again next time i am in vegas. \n\nlast, but certainly not least, the waiter concocted a duck hot-pot for us. i've not had much exposure to duck, and was weary of this one, but it was in a buttery sauce with lots of mushrooms, and it was incredibly silky and rich. needless to say, after all this food, we were stuffed!!! and of course, very happy. the manager came out to talk to us about the food as well, and i thought that was nice. \n\ni also tried the cucumber martini and the blackberry mojito. the mojito was good, but not particularly special. the cucumber martini, on the other hand, was light and refreshing and absolutely amazing. \n\nsushi samba is definitely first on my list next time i come to vegas!", 
            "i don't believe it is possible to give a better rating.  we went to vegas for my wife's birthday.  the was our last night, and we wanted to go out for the last time.  we had already eating diner a couple of hours before hand.  so we figured we would go for a late night snack.  we went to sushi samba, and could not have made a better decision.\n\nwe were pretty indecisive about what to order.  so our waitress suggested that we answer a few of her questions, and she would suggest a meal for us.  that was perfect.  we had the yellow tail tacos which was delicious.  very light, and refreshing.  then we had the <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> skewers.  amazing sauce, and was great.  then we ended up with the <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark>.  great meal.  great suggestions.\n\nbut the topper was the owner liz.  she came over to our table.  she was very welcoming, and actually talked to us.  i didn't feel as if she was doing it, as part of some shtick.  she was very genuine.  which was cool. \n\nwe ended the night with a vanilla chocolate cake for my wife's birthday.  overall great experience.  when we go back to vegas.  this will definitively be one of our stops.", 
            "this was our go to late night place while staying at the venetian. we opted to sit at the bar and try their happy hour specials along with a few things off their menu.\n\ni woud highly recommend the miso chilean <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>, as it was once of the best i have ever had. the vegetables that came with it were so tender and delicious, even though i hate brussels sprouts, the rest were quite good.\n\nthe <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> rolls were really good also, though small compared to other places i've had them.\n\nthe best vegetable dish i've had in a long time were the collard greens in an asian dressing. they were crunchy and filling enough for two. though, next time i'm not sharing! \n\nanother stand out to me were the fried plantains. normally, restaurants cut them thick and serve them with sides of beans and sour cream. i loved that these were cut thin and lightly breaded, deep fried and sprinkled only with some shavings of cheese. \n\nbesides the <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>, the items we got were only $5-6 bucks a dish and easily can be split by two. this was probably my favorite place to dine while there and probably one of the better late night dining options you have if you don't feel like burgers or sandwiches.\n\ni would have loved to give them a full 5 stars but the bar people were much to slow in not only forgetting to ask our order but forgetting to bring us our drinks after having to ask  three times, while serving those who just sat down right away. otherwise, the food was fantastic!",

            "i had an amazing dinner here for my bachelorette party! i've been to sushi samba in miami & was happy to be back. the vibe is very upbeat with a club feel & the food is a <mark>Uni</mark> fusion of south american & japanese...who would of thought?? our server was matt & not only was he attractive but he was kind enough to serve us a penis cake with sparkler candles...awesome! we heard about their \"secret\" prix fix menu here, so we decided to go with it. our server asked us a bunch of questions about our preferences & food allergies to gage what type of menu we would receive. it didn't matter because everthing they served us was absolutely great.  here is a run down of what we had: \n\n-<mark>Green Bean Tempura</mark> (light & crunchy) \n-shishita peppers (could eat a pound of these everyday) \n-pork gyoza (savory with a wonderful sweet potato puree underneath) \n-yellowtail sashimi (so fresh with a lovely sauce underneath) \n-lobster taco (good but doesn't knock my socks off like the others) \n-<mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark> (ummm...so good cant even begin to describe) \n-chilean <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> & chicken teriyaki skewers served with <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark> (<mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> was like butter, chicken was ok, couldn't stop eating the corn...think corn on steriods) \n-rolls (we got a variety, don't remember exactly but they were all very fresh) \nthat basically sums up our heavenly experience at sushi samba. our bill was pretty hefty after all was said & done. but it was totally worth it....i will be back! this time sans penis cake ;) thanks matt!!!", 
            "we were promised a \"dining experience\", and that's what we got!\n\na group of 6 of us came here, and we were instantly charmed by our server, michael. he recommended a custom \"dining experience\" for about $50-60 per person, based on our likes and dislikes. food just kept coming out and we had no idea what to expect, but michael really hit the nail on the head with everything he picked for us.\n\nsome of the highlights:\n\n- yellowtail tacos\n- yellowtail in lemongrass sauce\n- <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> (i don't eat <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>, but my friends were raving about it!). the <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark> that came with it was excellent \n- some kind of steak, cooked medium rare served with rice and beans\n- a sushi platter with <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark>, california, and <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark> rolls\n\nsushisamba is really great for groups, and since you can customize a meal based on your budget, it can be relatively affordable, too. and every dish was amazing! i definitely recommend it, and hope to try brunch at one of their nyc locations.", 
            "we had a large dinner party and ordered separately. we did not order appetizers or cocktails, just the main course. my family had the three meats (grilled hanger steak, ribeye and pork tenderloin) and the miso-marinated chilean <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>. the meats were flavorful. we enjoyed the ribeye and pork tenderloin the best of the three meats. the <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> was good, but it was not worth $29 for a tiny piece of fillet fish. we thought it was going to be a whole fish, enough to serve more than one person. the service was good when our waiter took our order, but he never came back to check up on our table to see how we were doing. we had to order extra rice and <mark>Miso Soup</mark> from other waiters and staff. our waiter finally came to our table just to drop off the check. the manager came around and asked about our food, and we told him about the issue with our waiter. he apologized and offered us bite-sized cookies. the food was good, but the service was okay.", 
            "asian and latin fushion = yummy!  must get the <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> and miso skewers!", 
            "this restaurant caught my eye because it was something out of the ordinary from your typical sushi restaurant. the menu offered an intriguing variety but when i began reading the reviews i knew i had to try it. i would suggest anyone going there for the first time to try the dining experience because you may think you know what you want but the chef knows better! the server asks if there is anything you do not like or if you have any food allergies and then how much money per person you're looking to spend. there are options anywhere from $50 per person to $130 per person if kobe beef if something that interests you. as it was for a special occasion we opted for $80 per person and even though thats more than i have probably ever spent on a single meal there were no regrets.\n\ncourse #1 consisted of berkshire pork gyoza which is basically pork dumplings in a pumpkin puree and yellowtail ceviche taquitos, both of which were absolutely delicious and not necessarily something i would have ordered on my own.\n\ncourse #2 was yellowtail sashimi in a spicy peruvian sauce with a slice of red jalapeno on top and octopus sashimi in a japanese citrus sauce which again were both to die for!\n\ncourse #3 had an array of <mark>Filet Mignon</mark>, <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>, <mark>Alaskan King Crab</mark> and <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark>. all were moist and tender but the <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> absolutely melted in your mouth! <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark> was a yummy alternative to <mark><mark>Osetra Caviar Imperial 20g</mark> 20g</mark> as well.\n\nfinally, course #4 was the main sushi dinner. <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark> rolls were delicious, but the <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> with i believe tuna on top was absolutely amazing! there was also <mark>Half Maine Lobster</mark> and another roll which i believe had lobster in it as well and was probably the only thing of the entire dinner that i was not absolutely amazed with, but it was still good!\n\nanother great thing about this place is they tell you if there is anything throughout this meal you do not like they will take it back and bring you something else! as our server said, \"its like a money back guarantee!\"\n\nanyways this is definitely a place i would tell everyone who loves trying new things to try or even just the sushi lover. do it! it will not disappoint!\n\nonly part i would complain about is the fact that there is not one in california!!!", 
            "this was definitely one of the best dining experiences i've had in lv. we called a few hours ahead to make reservations at 8:45pm on a friday night. the restaurant was packed and the decor is absolutely gorgeous. \n\nfor 2 we had:\n\n- edamame organic soybeans, sea salt, lime\n- <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark> golden pea shoot, snap pea jullienne, spicy mayo, black truffle vinaigrette\n- beef tenderloin and aji panca anticuchos\n- miso-marinated chilean <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> roasted organic vegetables and oshinko\n- bobo brazil roll* <mark>Seared W<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> Beef</mark>, avocado, kaiware, shiso, red onion, chimichurri\n- green envy* tuna, salmon, asparagus, wasabi pea crust, aji amarillo-key lime mayo\n\neverything was delicious! the <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark> and <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> were amazing. i wasn't a huge fan of the beef anticuchos, they were seasoned almost too much. the rolls were pretty small and didn't stand out as much as the other food. service was on point, and i would definitely come back!", 
            "first it was sensory overload with the lights, video and overly loud music.    second, the food was too hyped up for me, so the 45 min wait was not worth it on a tuesday.  \n\n- <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> skewers - good but nothing extra special.  \n- bobo brazil roll - couldn't really taste the ingredients, the sauce took over\n-  yamato roll - sounded way better on paper.  again, couldn't taste the ingredients as it was sauced up.  \n-  the sushi came with its own wasabi, which is perfectly fine, except they put way too much.  the taste of the fish was masked by it.  \n\noverall, i wouldn't go back.", 
            "stick with the sushi (4 stars) and stay away from the \"samba\" (zero stars)\n\ntheir most popular fusion dishes recommended by the staff are not worth getting.  they were dissappointing and overpriced.\nthe crispy yellowtail and lobster taquitos were just awful.\nthe <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> skewer was too sweet and syrupy and the pervian corn was gross.  \nthe yellowtail w jalapenos and lemongrass were just average.\n\nthe straight up sushi was better than i expected.  in particular, the yellowtail sushi (though a really small cut) was actually very good.", 
            "good drinks. great food. good music. great service. nothing bad to say about this place -- \nthis place was seriously the best place on the strip i've ever eaten. the perfect fusion of peruvian, brazilian, and japanese on point. <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> skewers, roasted duck with mushrooms, the brazilian bbq, the mango mojitos, brazilian pilsner....everything that touched our table was absolutely amazing. our waiter was carmeine and he did a perfect job of picking out all of our courses for us. if your in a big group and its your first time there, i highly recommend asking for carmeine and letting him chose your dishes for you. he paired everything perfectly. will definitely  be back again. next we're looking forward to the kobe steak that gets cooked on a hot rock on your table.", 
            "sushi samba is the best it can get! the chef's tasting menu is the way to go. i can't even fully describe how amazing everything we had was. we started off with the edamame, shisito and <mark>Green Bean Tempura</mark>. the shishito are seared and roasted peppers, which were spicy but good. the tempura was amazing with this black truffle alioli that i wanted to drizzle on everything!\n\nthen came chicken gyoza, which was so tender on top of pumpkin puree. before we knew it they were bringing out rolls, one tuna and one with fresh crab. i was starting to feel full, when all of a sudden came the miso <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> and beef tenderloin skewers. they were served with this <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark> that i haven't been able to stop thinking about since.the kernels are the size of quarters!  and i didn't even get to mention the nice cocktail list until now, so you know the food was good.\n\nall in all it was one of the best meals i've had in a really long time. they also had a similar sized spread for my friend who is a vegetarian and graciously agreed to go with us.", 
            "not impressed.  the food here is good, but you're paying for the \"club\" ambiance, not the quality of food .  everything is overpriced for what you're getting, and comparing them to other sushi restaurants on the strip, i would spend my money elsewhere.  i did like the <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>, but other than that, i didn't care for the food.   \nwe did the omakase dinner, so we had a large selection of their menu, but i couldn't really get myself excited about anything we tried.  i wasn't happy about the steaming rock we had to cook our meat on either...it made myself and my friend smell like smoke the remainder of the night.  for almost $100/person, i would have rather tried somewhere else.", 
            "when my boyfriend proposed dinner at sushisamba i wasn't 100% sure what to expect. naturally, i immediately assumed it was sushi with a bit of a twist, but i didn't really expect the menu they had in store! they offered a very cool japanese, peruvian and brazilian fusion (not your everyday mash-up!) and everything was executed brilliantly. i was a touch put off at the outset when the waiter told us that he could create a dinner experience for us without much of our input. after finding out about food allergies, dietary restrictions, etc. he gave us a ballpark of about $50 - $60 per person and took it from there. we, quite literally, ordered nothing off of the menu - everything that we ate was something that our waiter thought would be a hit for us. while i was skeptical, it actually worked out well! he brought us some amazing dishes (the corn that accompanies the <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> is insanely good and the ahi tacos were stellar) though we could have probably done with a couple fewer dishes. we left absolutely stuffed and very impressed. \n\ni'm sure we could have kept it under $100 (not including drinks) if we were to order on our own (we got a lot of food, including a few orders that probably wouldn't have been on our agenda), but if you're okay with the price range laid out, they do know their stuff! all around good experience. i would go again, but now that we've tried quite a few things, i would prefer to place my own order. :)", 
            "portions are so insanely small. i hardly ever finish a plate and these were tiny even for me. the chilean <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> was to die for but after spending a fortune and still feeling starved afterwards i just would not ever return.",

            "fantastic flavors, quality service, squishy seating just about sums up my experience. went here on saturday night and enjoyed the overall experience. my friend and i started with <mark>Miso Soup</mark>. then, when looking at the menu, my friend raved about <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>. i said i wasn't sure if i've had it... this time was memorable. before we ordered, we asked the waitress what she recommended. she mentioned the <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> and miso robato to share and a few rolls. we picked one roll not on the menu and the bobo brazil. nom nom nom we loved it all. the skewers of <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> were delicate with nicely flavored sauce. it came with giant corn pieces that were sort of fun and different. the bobo brazil roll was very nice - i think i had this particular roll at the chicago location, the kobe beef gets me. the sauce on this one was a bit tangy and citrus-y. i think there were the roll that was not on the menu had tempura shirmp inside with crab on top with thinly sliced avocado. the flavors and textures were incredible. highly recommend this place for a nice meal. my only issue was with the seating. the hostess had to literally shift over the table each tiem she sat a new couple - we were in a tight area full of tables for two. we came on a busy saturday night, so i also recommend reservations.",

            "i want to like this place so much.  the food that we got was delicious (the <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> skewers are amazingly soft and flaky, and the black truffle sauce that comes with the fried green beans is tdf), but the service we got was horrible.  our server was fine--she was upbeat and tried to work with our wants, but whomever it was that also talked to us was horrible.  \n\nto be fair, we were a large group (about 14 or 15), and understandably it is hard to accommodate such a large group, let alone trying to get our food out at the same time.  honestly, i could care less if my food came out at the same time as the people i had been sitting with.  before we could even look at the menus to see what was available a la carte, the restaurant pushed us into this 'tasting menu' that would \"incorporate our tastes as well as some of their classic dishes\"--sounds fine, but in a group of 14 or 15 people who have very varied tastes, that is almost impossible to do.  to begin with, some of our group members didn't eat any raw fish, and others were basically only interested in raw fish.  we eventually agreed to this tasting menu just out of an unwillingness to continue \"fighting\".  they tried to appease by sending us some shooters and edamame, grilled shishito peppers, and fried green beans to start.  great, and thanks, but still not the best service you could ask for at a restaurant like here. \n\nif this rating were about the food only, i would give it 5 stars.  the food really is delicious, and the decor (while strange) goes well with the feel that the restaurant seems to be going for.  the pork in our meat sampler platter was overdone and dry, but two types of beefs that were perfectly cooked made up for it.  the appetizer of some sort of spicy tempura rock shrimp salad was moist with the perfect amount of chewiness and spring; it's spicy, but not in the give-me-milk-to-guzzle-now way.  the sushi that we were served, however, was pretty sub-standard.  i'm sure this was because it had to fall in line with our tasting menu price point (which somehow got haggled down); honestly, i did not come to sushisamba just to get <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> rolls.. i could get that anywhere. \n\nin short, come here if you're in a small group.  the food really is worth it, many times over.  i'm sure it will be a far more amazing trip than the one i had in a large group.", 
            "my favorite thing about this restaurant is the option of having a \"custom menu.\" for a flat per person fee, you can ask your waiter (ours was max, who was incredibly attentive and friendly) to order your food for you. as a restaurant with three kitchens (japanese, brazillian & peruvian, don't quote me on that last one), the diversity of dishes you can consume is great. \n\nevery time a dish was brought out for us, max would sit down for a couple seconds and explain each dish. it was really fun not knowing what came out next! for about $70/person (with tip) we got:\n\ndumplings and ceviche\nfour types of sashimi\n<mark>Peruvian Corn</mark> & grilled miso <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>\nalbacore tuna roll & <mark>El Topo</mark> roll\nbraised <mark>Duck Breast</mark> with japanese mushrooms\n\nall of which were amazing. do the \"custom menu.\" it's what makes this place <mark>Uni</mark> and fun!",

            "i came here on a saturday night for dinner to celebrate my 25th birthday with the best of company, fun entertainment, and delicious food!!! i'd been here before but always sat in the front of the restaurant... had no clue how huge this place was!!! we sat in the very back (where it seems many of the large birthday parties were seated) the ambiance of the restaurant is very dark and jungle esque (if i remember correctly o.o) lol very ruckusy and vegas appropriate! there were drummers and scandalous (but h0t) dancers going up and down the aisles which provided for the fun entertainment.  but enough of that, on to the main event. \n\nwe had a party of 6 and decided it best to do as our super nice server suggested, omakase style :) \n- cucumber cocktail on the house!!! they brought each of us a mini cocktail to start the meal off! very nice and considerate of them! nice and refreshing and definitely got my appetite going :) \n- a trio appetizer platter consisting of well salted edamame, roasted shito peppers, and deep fried string beans served in the most delicious chipotle aoli sauce (all 3 were delicious but i think my favorite would have to be the roasted shito peppers with a drizzle of lime juice for a nice kick)\n- yellowtail sashimi mini tacos!!! these were sooo fun and delicious! great fushion idea! the restaurant is very accommodating, we mentioned to them 1 of the girls is allergic to cilantro so they brought out a special lobster taco for just for her! the flavors were bold and the taco shell was nice and crispy.  but i think i still enjoy dos camino's mini tacos better...those are to.die.for.  \n- ahi tuna over a piece of bamboo and basil leaf.  this was an interesting combination.  probably my least favorite dish of the night.  the basil leaf was a bit overwhelming and covered the taste of the ahi too much. \n- <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> with oversized asparagus.  the meat was tender and very well cooked, very pink in the middle.  i'm not a big beef eater so i only ate the edges of the piece but my friends seemed to enjoy it.  definitely not one of the top dishes of the night but was still yummy.  the asparagus however, was quite delicious!! they probably cooked it in butter... hahaha i'll take it :) a good bite on the outside and nice and tender on the inside! \n- <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> with oversized <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark>!!! yummmy!!!! the <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> was nice and flaky.  flavoring was a bit salty but i feel like at these restaurants they tend to do that a bit...i mean, everyones a bit intoxicated so salty foods are what people want lol the <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark> was just really fun to eat!! my friends really enjoyed it but i definitely like summer sweet white corn on the cob better :) \n- mushroom pot on crack. this was definitely the show stopper of the night!!! the flavoring of the sauce, the textures of the 3? 4? different mushrooms. happiness. the sauce was like a cream of mushroom, milky, full flavored, salty, a hint of sweetness... too good. needless to say we all took a bite and just smiled in satisfaction. we all stared at each other and knew rice was needed to soak up all that bomb sauce!! \n- 4 different sushi rolls were brought out last (3.5 stars).  all 4 were decent, nothing really to rave much about unfor<mark>Tuna</mark>. :(  i'm a big big sushi lover and have had some off the chart rolls so i can't pretend these were anything to die for.  \n\n***the first time i came my friend ordered for the table and i definitely think that made a difference.  they have some really scrumptious dishes that i wish i could've ordered for my friends to try!! perhaps next time!! i'll be more prepared lol \n\noverall ratings:\nfood - 3.75 stars (except for the mushroom pot on crack... 4.5 stars for that)\nfood (for the first time i came) - 4.25 stars! \ndrink - 4 stars for the cucumber cocktail & bottle of santa margaritta pino grigio\npresentation - 4 stars\nservice & ambiance - 4 stars\n\ni gave this place 4 stars mainly because i had a great time that night, and the company i kept definitely played a big part in that.  the food is goood, just a bit $$$$.  its definitely a great place to go with a group thats just looking for some good eats, good drinks, and a great time :o) bottom line: i'd definitely go back again!!",

            "i almost want to give this a 5. near oh my god moment, but not quite.\n\nthis is a little misleading. i swear this came up under \"chinese\" on yelp while we were looking for something (in a group <mark><mark>Assortment of Four</mark></mark>) but this is definitely not chinese. it's japanese brazilian fusion, which i had never had, but was awesome. the menu is a bid daunting, but the waitress offered to bring out a tasting menu for us, based on the common questions like, \"are you ok with raw fish,\" \"do you have allergies,\" \"how do you eat red meat,\" etc. this was helpful - usually i'm not fazed by the large menu, but for some reason i was having problems focusing. worth mentioning they say up front that they'll take back anything we don't like, no charge, and they do ask for a budget to keep them in line.\n\nwhat we got was really pretty exceptional. gyoza steamed and pan fried, hamachi taquitos (not what you're thinking - not the deep fried rolls, but little taco shells filled with hamachi sashimi), seared tuna with baby greens and crunchy salt, and portabella fries with kabocha aioli. all sounds fancy, all really good.\n\nthen a warm plate - grilled <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> with a sweet glaze, <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> (not their a5 w<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark>, which we were offered for an upcharge, but declined) and <mark><mark>Alaskan King Crab</mark> Leg</mark>, all with a side of elote. the bass was good - tender and flaky, and i like the glaze. but it was crazy overpowered by the beef and crab. firstly, the beef was far superior to what we had at n9ne. tender, flavorful, and with a great salt and pepper crust on the outside, served with a little pile of powdered chile for dipping. and the crab was that near oh my god moment. an *enormous* <mark><mark>Alaskan King Crab</mark> Leg</mark>, brushed with a sort of thick butter sauce, served piping hot. wow, this was exceptional. and while i guess i should expect it, points to the restaurant for realizing that serving a filet and a <mark><mark>Alaskan King Crab</mark> Leg</mark> family style to diners that have only chopsticks required that you slice things up in to nice little bite sized pieces.\n\nfinally, sushi. their <mark>Neo Tokyo</mark> roll, which is their version of the <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark>, a hamachi roll with spicy crab and avocado on top, a tuna roll with asparagus, dusted with wasabi, and an assortment of sashimi and nigiri. as well as a hot roll - something covered in melted mozzarella, crispy onions and a sweet sauce. all of the cold rolls were good - i especially liked their <mark>Neo Tokyo</mark> roll. the sashimi was also very good, but the hot roll...i could do without. it was in interesting twist - not just the cheese was hot, but the entire roll, rice and all. however, the cheese and a heaping helping of onion and sauce overpowered whatever might have been inside. this was about the only misstep i could find.\n\nthe atmosphere is odd - lots of pounding techno music, along with an odd video collage (on many many video screens) of brazilian beach babes, bullet trains, brazilian slums, and japanese salarymen trudging to their soul-murdering jobs. not sure what they were going for. but whatever.\n\ngreat spot - chinese though it wasn't, we all were appropriately full when it was over (not hungry, no stuffed) and we all agreed we'd be back. the total bill, excluding drinks, was probably about $65 per person. i loved the mix of appetizers, hot beef and seafood, and sushi. if you're going with a group, this is a fun way to try stuff without having to worry about reading a menu.",

            "it was a good experience to try something new in sushi, but there was nothing that really stood out in taste that would make me return. we took a lot of the server's recommendations for popular items like the specialty dishes <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> with <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark> and yellowtail taquitos served like tapas, which were both good. the <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark> was ok, but didn't seem to have a complimenting taste with the <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>. we let the server know and he brought out some <mark>Purple Potato Mash</mark> just to try something different and it was better than the corn. \n\nthe service was great. our server was very knowledgeable about the food, how it was prepared and the types of sake that was offered. we enjoyed 4 different <mark>Sake</mark>, which was more enjoyable than the sushi. \n\nif you want to feel like you ate a lot, stick with mostly rolls... the rice will help fill you up.\n\ntypical price for food in lv... $$$... although i didn't think we ordered that much and the cost was just short of the 200 mark for two.\n\ngood brazilian/peruvian fusion... but if i had a choice between this and <mark><mark>Osetra Caviar Imperial 20g</mark> 20g</mark>... obviously traditional.",

            "what a disappointment.\n\nno point in having a reservation as you will have to wait 20-30 min. after your scheduled time.  the front end pretty much sucks. our server was very good though.\n\nfood was small, nothing special, and ridiculously priced.\n\n-rock shrimp was good, but like a glorified calamari dish, nothing spectacular \n-fusion rolls were a joke, no flavor\n-<mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> was awesome!  2 tiny skewers like $20, um ok, not worth it\n\nthe restaurant is pretty popping, and trendy with a dj its a cool environment\nmy recommendation is to go sit at the bar have a few drinks, and maybe an appetizer if you are staying at palazzo, if not skip sushisamba.", 
            "i flipping love sushisamba. i've been here 3 times and it's just been incredible. this most recent trip, we were a group of 9 girls for a bachelorette party. we had lucked out by getting reservations the day of and they didn't make us wait. i thought they seated us in a weird spot...but no, our reservations were just so early, the place wasn't that full, but the table ended up being fine.\n\nwe decided to do the omakase style for around $50/person. they brought out the cocktail tree with 9 glasses of the samba juice which was incredible and such a great way for them to start wooing us, haha. \n- first course: fried green beans with truffle aioli (my fave!), grilled jalepenos (big hit!), and edamame.\n- second course: fish tacquitos (loved the shell, very crispy), a mushroom tacquito & large salad for the vegetarian, and pork pot stickers (good not great). \n- third course: the famed chilean <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> skewers (melt.in.your.mouth), <mark>Scallop</mark> with like a chimichurri sauce (delicious), and the <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark> (so <mark>Uni</mark>). \n- fourth course: meat/mushroom coconut milk \"curry\" (i hate coconut milk, and this was the one dish that we didn't make a considerable dent in...and they don't serve rice with this! weird).\n- fifth course: sushi. there were 3 different fish sushi rolls (salmon, tuna, and something else) and then 3 vegetarian (avocado, cucumber, and sweet potato--sweet potato was my fave!). they then brought out the dessert for my friend, which was comp'd which was nice.\n\nin my opinion, i felt like the chef prepared way too many fish dishes for this particular group because we had a vegetarian, we had someone who was allergic to shellfish, and we had 3 people who didn't like fish...and yet, we got a lot of fish. i think a lot of people go to sushisamba and expect sushi...but it's fushion, it's not <mark><mark>Osetra Caviar Imperial 20g</mark> 20g</mark>. i would definitely recommend doing the omakase style to start out--you can do it for $30-$75 per person and it's really fun. i rate it 4 stars because i think they should be more creative for vegetarians--vegetarians eat more than mushrooms :) but the service is great and the food is amazing. definitely one of my most consistent favorite places in vegas.", 
            "great fusion restaurant with a nice mix of small plates and interesting entrees. my favorite dish is the \"<mark>Moqueca Mista</mark>\" - a rice dish covered in a ton of seafood \"curry\". the flavor of the sauce is perfect and not overly sweet or coconut-flavored. \n\nwe also tried:\n1. crispy yellowtail taquitos - so good and perfectly crispy \n2. ceviche +tiradito combo of 4 - nothing special\n3. <mark>Berkshire Pork Belly</mark> robata - a little too sweet with the butterscotch miso \n4. <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> robata - also a bit too sweet\n5. salt + <mark>Salt and Pepper Squid</mark> - yum, this was fried with a lot of flavor\n6. <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark> - a bit too much mayo-sauce for my taste\n\noverall this was our second visit and if you order just the right things (i would stick with the fried appetizers and <mark>Moqueca Mista</mark>) then it's a great meal. it's pricey - but hey, it's vegas so i'm not really factoring that into my review. i would definitely go back again!",

            "i wanted to give this 4.5 stars, but i'll round down. came here with my sister for a convention in vegas, we walked around the venetian and pallazzo for a while until we finally decided on sushisamba.  first of all, the restaurant is beautiful. i really love the wall painings, interior design, and the bathroom design was really cool as well. service here was excellent, my water was always full, when i got up to use the restroom i placed my napkin on the table, when i came back it was neatly folded back for me. \n\nwe decided to get two appetizers. first the <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark>... really no point in ordering this. tempura taste the same everywhere, nothing special about theirs. we also tried the taquitos as suggested by the waitress. these were really just mini taco's. main lobster and yellowtail. both were nice and chilled taco's. good sauce on the side. not sure if i'd order them again, but they were decent.\n\nfor dinner my sister ordered their miso marinated chilean <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>. this was absolutely excellent. the fish was cooked perfectly, it was so soft and delicious. it's served with vegetables and those were pretty good too. possibly the post chilean <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> i've ever had. \n\nfor my dinner i decided to order two rolls, the <mark>Neo Tokyo</mark> and the bobo brazil. the <mark>Neo Tokyo</mark>, which is bigeye tuna and tempura flake was delicious. the little sauce on top was a nice spicy sauce. this roll was very delicious. as for the bobo brazil.... quite gross, too much avocado, wayyy too much in fact, in overpowered the entire roll. both regular avocado and some mushy avocado. in addition the red onion also gave it some very odd taste. this was one of the worst sushi rolls i have ever eaten.\n\nfor dessert we ordered the samba split for two. it was really good, and a decent sized portion. everything on the plate complemented each other and the banana brulee was fantastic.", 
            "ever since i came here the first time i went to vegas, i've been dying to come back.\n\nthe food is so good!  i thought we just got lucky the first time we came, but as it turns out, everything we've tried on the menu thus far is delicious.\n\nambiance is classy and cool.  it's a nice location within the palazzo hotel with lots of seats.  service was also good, as my water glass was always full despite being very busy on a friday night at midnight.\n\nwe got:\n\n<mark>Moqueca Mista</mark> - shrimp, squid, <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>, coconut milk, roasted cashew, dende oil, chimichurri rice - $29 - http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sushisamba-las-vegas?select=t4jwaobhrbkbp4vr92x4ua#t4jwaobhrbkbp4vr92x4ua\n\nthis thing is the best ever.  creamy thai-style curry taste (hence coconut milk) with the delicate seafood mixed in with bits of crushed cashews, giving the dish great texture.  rice was served within the sauce mixture as shown; the rice soaked up all the sauce, making every morsel divine.  i thought after a while the dish would get too rich-tasting, but somehow i kept gobbling and gobbling until the plate was empty!\n\n<mark>El Topo</mark> sushi roll - salmon, jalape\\u00f1o, shiso leaf, fresh melted mozzerella, crispy onion - $15 (forgot to take a pic; too excited about the <mark>Moqueca Mista</mark>)\n\nvery <mark>Uni</mark> roll with interesting flavors and textures = delicious!\n\nchicken teriyaki - samba style <mark>Organic Chicken</mark>, aji amarillo, <mark>Purple Potato Mash</mark>, crispy onion - $26 (again forgot to take a pic...)\n\nwhen i saw the huge price tag i thought \"wtf?!\", especially for a seemingly simple plate as chicken teriyaki (my friend ordered this one so i had no control).  buttt i'll have to say that it was probably the best teriyaki chicken i've ever had in my life!  super juicy fillets of teriyaki chicken, pan fried (i think) to a crisp.  the sauce was perfect; not too saucy, not too dry, and definitely not overpowering to the dish.\n\nas with all finer dining restaurants, especially on the las vegas strip, i did think the prices were a little inflated.  hence the lack of that final star.  however, probably one of my favorite places to eat while in vegas.  i'll definitely hit it up again on future trips.  they have a good happy hour too (both early evening and late night), so i'll have to take advantage of that next time! :)", 
            "great ambiance, decent food.\na lot of people have recommended this restaurant, but i think it's a bit overrated. \ni love sushi.  although the sushi was well presented, they didn't taste like anything spectacular.  surprisingly not too many rolls to choose from even though they try to create some original specialty rolls.  \n\n<mark>Neo Tokyo</mark> roll - <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> inside, tuna outside.  this roll was just ok.  it just tastes like <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark>.\n\n<mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> skewers - probably our only favorite dish.  comes with corn.\n\n<mark>El Topo</mark> roll - good, sorta like a crunchy roll, crispy onions and mayo on top.\n\n<mark>Berkshire Pork Belly</mark> ramen - highly recommended by server, but a huge disappointment.  it was a failed attempt.  the broth was clear and bland.  it tasted like instant ramen with a hint of tom yum soup flavoring.  nothing like ramen at all.  \n\nsushisamba has good food, it just didn't show me anything new or exciting except that you're in a really nice restaurant, but you're paying for it.", 
            "i'm so glad i made reservations here\n\ni wanted to reserve a place that wasn't italian or heavy in the venetian or palazzo for my group of 8 girls.  we arrived a little early for our reservation and was seated immediately.  my cousin told the waiter what we liked and didn't like.  he said he would create a meal according to what we wanted.  everything was fantastic.  below is what we had and its description:\n\npork gyozo-  each dumpling was served on a delicious pumpkin puree.  delicious!\n\nsushi platter- we got 5 different types of rolls, 2 of each type.  they were all so good.  \n\ntiger rock shrimp- yum!  if you like honey walnut shrimp then you will definitely like this.  it was perfectly made.  \n\nyellowtail ceviche tacos- these were the best tacos i have ever had.  the sauce it came with was a yummy spicy foam hot sauce.  they were small but definitely satisfying.  they just melt in your mouth.  so good!  probably my favorite thing there.  \n\nsteak- the steak was served with collard greens, potatoes, rice, and black beans.  it also came out with 3 different sauces that were all so good.  the green sauce was my favorite.  \n\n<mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> on skewers- this was served with some <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark>.  the <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> just melts in your mouth.  they were perfectly made.  the corn was also really good and went perfectly with the <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>.     \n\nshots- our shots came out beautifully presented on a shot tier.  two of us didn't drink so our waiter brought out two that were watermelon juice so we could join in on toasting.    \n\ndessert- dessert was a mix of the best vanilla ice cream, creme burlee, mixed berries, and banana.  it was nicely made and topped off with some sparklers.  \n\neverything was so tasty and beautifully presented.  the food wasn't just all japanese.  it was definitely a fusion but everything went together wonderfully.  i think for us 8 girls it was about $75 each.  it was very worth it and we all left stuffed and happy.      \n\nour server took care of us really well.  i liked that he noted there were 8 of us and made the portions perfect for 8 girls.  one of our girls couldn't eat raw fish or anything spicy and he made sure she got her own individual thing.  he also made note that two of us couldn't drink and brought out shots for everyone with 2 virgin drinks.  he made great recommendations and was helpful.  he also took time to take a couple photos for us.  as for the the ambiance, it was beautiful.  we had a great time celebrating.", 
            "food is pretty good, wait staff is really nice and great service but it's ridiculously overpriced. get sushi somewhere else if that's what you're looking for. \n\ndid their sampler menu which includes sushi, seafood and kobe beef. nothing tasted bad....but it was $150 a person. one out of the 9 items brought to the table was memorable - the <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> on a stick. oh, and the $8 double shot of espresso that woke me up ;). \n\ncost our group of 7 over $1k. not that much food. outrageously priced and you can get way better (more interesting and flavorful) sushi for a fraction of the cost. nice service and wait staff though. unless you're rich don't waste your money. nice of them to give us birthday shooters of a tasty pink lemonade shooter.", 
            "this is a \"must go\" place for me while in vegas. \n\nwe always give the server a budget and have them surprise us.   they always pick things you wouldn't naturally gravitate towards, but are amazing dishes!   my favorites are:  <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>, yellow tail tacos, crab cakes, and <mark><mark>Alaskan King Crab</mark> Leg</mark>.   \n\ngreat customer service as well!", 
            "i wasn't feeling sushi, but i went with it. \nmy expectations were low, just another sushi bar in vegas...\nwe gave our server, veronica, a per-person budget and let her pick.\n\n i was blown away!\n\nwe were served mini tacos, <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> skewers, sashimi ceviche, <mark>Seared W<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> Beef</mark>, salt & <mark>Salt and Pepper Squid</mark> and more. the plates just kept coming. how did they get such incredible flavors into the food? i would put sushisamba up against the best. sure, nobu (malibu) may have great atmosphere, but the flavors, quality, variety, and probably 100 different <mark>Sake</mark> here, make them a strong competitor. \n\n\nservice was impeccable (ask for veronica).", 
            "located in the shoppes at palazzo casino. my original plan was to get some comps redeemed for grand lux cafe (which is a great place as well). to my surprise, i had over 100 bucks available...i don't remember playing in the venetian poker room that much, but oh well. a bigger surprise, they had a long list of places i could use comps at, including steakhouses, and here. this is not the norm for vegas poker rooms. i guess this could be a venetian poker room review as well; they treat their customers very well! so i decided to try this place. \n\ni'm very glad that i did! my waitress isabella was very attentive, thorough, and answered any questions i had. top notch service! the rest of the waitstaff was even friendlier. my table was periodically kept clean, and lots of refills kept coming. \n\ni was expecting to eat regular sushi, maybe a tasting menu. and i never really thought of what the samba part meant. but i looked at the menu and there were lots of options available, fusion-style: from brazilian steaks to <mark><mark>Osetra Caviar Imperial 20g</mark> 20g</mark> rolls. i was in for an unexpected and different, yet very satisfying meal. \n\n-samba tea: this is a must try! i forgot what they were, but they included many different types of ingredients; the result being one of my favorite teas, if not my favorite. \n-bobo brazil samba roll: <mark>Seared W<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> Beef</mark>, brazilian-japanese style...something new and amazing!\n-miso-marinated chilean <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>...so good! one of the best fish i've ever had.\n-20oz <mark>Bone in Ribeye</mark> steak: juicy and delicious. loved the flavor! goes very well with the sushisamba dipping sauces. \n-warm chocolate banana cake (maple butter, banana chip, vanilla rum ice cream)...awesome!\n\nservice: 5/5; food: 5/5!\n\nthis was a <mark>Uni</mark> and awesome dining experience for me. and it looks like there's plenty more to try! thanks sushisamba. i would definitely come back!",

            "an excellent fusion of japanese, brazilian, and peruvian.  what i found different about this establishment compared to others is the approach of ordering from their menu.  our waiter asked us for a price range we're willing to spend.  an example range is $60-$120.  my brother (who's birthday we're celebrating) said about $80 per person.  next, the waiter asks us what our likes, dislikes, allergies, etc in order to create a <mark>Uni</mark> dining experience for us.  my brother basically said he doesn't want to eat sushi (he didn't feel like it that day), wants to try the gyoza, and definitely want to sample the kobe beef.  after our drinks arrived, we waited about 10-20 minutes before our appetizers and entrees came.\n\nwe tried a variety of food which ranged from gyozas, skewers, <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>, and kobe beef.  the main attraction is the kobe beef where they bring a large stone that's heated to 700 f for us to cook our thinly sliced beef on.  the waiter demonstrated by taking some butter and spreading it on top of the stone followed by laying the beef on top like it's sunbathing.  after a minute or two, the beef slices were dipped onto 1 of 3 sauces and finally onto our table.  the verdict: mouth watering bliss.  almost as good as the kobe beef i had in kobe, japan!!!\n\nthe last attraction is the birthday dessert given to my brother.  the candles were sparkling similar to the morning glory fireworks that kids hold in their hands.  truly a memorable experience.", 
            "on the saturday of my bachelorette party, my girlfriends treated me to dinner at sushi samba.  it was a fabulous, memorable meal, where we ate well and celebrated in style.\n\nwe were staying at the palazzo, and sushi samba was the perfect venue for the occasion.  it was convenient to get to in heels, and the atmosphere was festive, edging on clubby without being obnoxious.  we had a big comfortable table, and service was excellent.  i wish we'd gotten the name of our waiter - he did a great job attending to our every need, and he guided us through the whole dining experience with expertise.  (for management - he was a tall guy who served a party of nine on 6/29.  you know, your only bachelorette party of the month?)\n\nwe ordered cocktails, which were pretty good.  i had a blame it on rio, a caipirinha variation with cacha\\u00e7a, agave syrup, fresh lime juice, cucumber, and jalape\\u00f1o.  it was both cool and spicy, and it went down really easy.  the classic caipirinha was also great, with just the cacha\\u00e7a, lime, and sugar.  i also tried some of the chu-cumber, a shochu drink with hendricks gin, elderflower liqueur, and muddled cucumber - very refreshing.  at some point, we got a complimentary cocktail tree, a beautiful iron tree bearing shot-sized wine glasses on every branch.  they held some frothy, sweet version of a screwdriver that was great for the occasion.\n\ndinner was delicious.  we had the option of ordering a la carte or omakase, and we decided to keep things simple.  we specified a price point and listed dietary restrictions, and the food just started coming.  it was all served family style, and everything was well portioned for our big group.  we left full but not overstuffed - a plus, since it had taken a team to stuff me into my white dress for the night.  the cuisine was fun, a creative, unforced fusion of japanese and peruvian styles.\n\nfirst, we had a trio of vegetable otsumami, all served together in a lovely green array.  there was the staple edamame with sea salt and lime, and <mark>Green Bean Tempura</mark> served with a rich black truffle aioli.  my favorite of the three, though, was the handful of shishito peppers.  these were grilled blistering black, polished with sea salt and lemon.  they were pretty irresistible.  next we got a tray of japanese a5 <mark>Seared W<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> Beef</mark> gyoza.  these were great, thin-skinned and stuffed with luscious hunks of beef rather than the usual mince.  they came with kabocha pumpkin pur\\u00e9e, a sweet soy drizzle, and a su-shoyu dipping sauce.  the best thing i ate all night, though, was a crispy taquito overflowing with yelllowtail, avocado, and roasted corn miso.  the shell was thin and crunchy, and the fresh, tender fish was just right with that avocado, miso, and some thinly sliced vegetables.  the taquitos were served with spicy aji panca sauce and fresh lime - that piquant, frothy sauce was just the icing on a beautiful fusion taco cake.\n\nafter the smaller plates were done, we moved on to big platters of sushi and sashimi.  i do not remember everything we got, as there were at least six or seven rolls and even more kinds of sashimi.  the rolls were great, a nice mix of california standards - you know, the mix and match of eel, yellowtail, tuna, etc. with avocado, cucumber, and dots of mayo - and more samba-specific stuff, with the stray <mark><mark>Alaskan King Crab</mark> Leg</mark> and lobster claw.  i particularly liked the <mark>Samba Strip</mark>, with <mark>Half Maine Lobster</mark> tempura, mango, tomato, chive, soy paper, and a coating of crispy rice.  it was unusual and flavorful, served with a peanut curry.  the rest of the platter came with a sweet thick soy sauce and a bit of mayo.  the sashimi was more traditional, served on a bed of ice.  it was hard to share, as there was only one of each kind, but the slivers i had were great.\n\nthe most filling part of the meal was the churrasco course.  we got two hefty platters of the <mark>Rio Grande</mark> with three meats, grilled hanger steak, ribeye, and chorizo.  these were great, juicy and tender and full of that hearty grilled meat flavor.  they came with a trio of dipping sauces - malagueta pepper oil, chimichurri, and a third that is infuriatingly absent from the menu.  we also had some sides of rice, beans, collard greens, and a medley of <mark>Roasted Seasonal Vegetables</mark> - giant corn kernels, toothsome brussels sprouts, carrots, celery, pearl onions, and more.  we also got miso-marinated chilean <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> a la carte, with roasted organic vegetables and oshinko.  this was a winner - the fish was moist, flakey, and shot through with miso flavor.\n\nwe were full by dessert, but loved the complimentary chocolate mousse, served with a sparkler and a congratulatory message.  the lush mousse came topped with crunchy chocolate pearls, whipped cream, and a little bit of candle-stuck banana.  we each got a sweet bite to end our wonderful dinner.\n\nin conclusion, my friends are the best - thank you girls for this weekend, and for this fun, delicious meal.  sushi samba was an a+ choice, worthy of a night i won't soon forget.",

            "we came to sushisamba for my birthday dinner a few days ago and i was blown away by the food! it definitely exceeded expectations.\n\nthe menu was so overwhelming we didn't know where to even begin and while our waiter didn't really help us narrow things down, he did make some good suggestions and helped us pace out the meal so we can order as we go. he came with the manager, who was very nice and gave us birthday shots, and also asked that we let him know if he could do anything. \n\nhere's what we started with: shishito peppers combo (grilled shishito peppers, tempura string beans with a truffle aioli, and edamame), <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark> in a spicy mayo sauce, <mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark>, and <mark>Crispy Hokkaido Scallop</mark> lettuce wraps. the peppers were a good surprise of the night because i didn't expect it to come with the string beans and edamame, but i definitely appreciated the greens in vegas! the <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark> was really tasty, but i wish it was a little crunchier when it came out. they tasted a bit soggy as if they were sitting in sauce for too long, but no complaints because the flavor was still there. the <mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> was good, but nothing really mind-blowing in my opinion. the <mark>Crispy Hokkaido Scallop</mark> lettuce wrap was phenomenal. our waiter said it was a new item on the menu and suggested we try it and it really blew us all out of the water. \n\nwe followed up the first round with the robata - we got the <mark>Berkshire Pork Belly</mark>, rib eye, <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>, and duck. all of them were so good, so make sure you pay a visit to the robata section when you visit! the duck and the rib eye to me stood out more than the others - they were cooked very well and had a good mix of <mark>Uni</mark> flavors.\n\nwe finished off dessert with their 4th of july special (red velvet cheesecake, frozen blueberries, and white chocolate ice cream) and sadly we were underwhelmed with what came out. i think we were so blown away by the entire meal, we felt like dessert was going to continue the streak, but were left wanting a bit more. either way, we were so stuffed it didn't matter and the dessert didn't take away from how much we liked the meal itself.\n\nwhat really set this over the edge is that the chef came out to shake our hands and chat with us really quickly, which i really appreciated! the service was great, the recommendations were on par, and the food was delicious. i would definitely recommend this spot for a special occasion - go ahead and gorge!!", 
            "this restaurant gets very high marks.\n\nlet's talk about the food- everything on the menu is delicious. the different ethnic combinations is what sets this place apart. the flavor the variety, and a must chilean <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> skewers.\n\nthe service- always smiling very friendly. the management comes over to give our party a complimentary app for being returned guests. they really know how to make you feel welcome and special. everyone from the manager, bar tenders, greeters, servers, and bussing staff conduct themselves in a highly professional manner.\n\nif you are in vegas you have to stop here, try and do small plates and try all different things on this wonderful menu.\n\nthis is the kind of restaurant where you would say to yourself aft spending a few hundred on a nice meal it was worth it.", 
            "my dining experience fell short of my expectations considering what we ate (or shall i say what we didn't eat) compared to what we paid. there were 21 of us for dinner and we had the chef's selection, also known as omakase. typically, you would get the most innovative dishes ordering this style.  however, we were served typical menu items.  i think it was just a strategic way for them to serve a larger group without having to cater to individual orders. \n\nthe good was that most of the items we tasted were pretty good. the bad was that we weren't given enough food to taste everything, even though we were all charged the same price.  \n\ninstead, we shared each plate of food between 5-7 people, which included the following: \n(1) <mark>Tuna Tataki</mark>: only got to try it because someone didn't eat raw fish. \n(2) <mark>Seared W<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> Beef</mark> dumplings: not enough brought out so i never got to try it. \n(3) mini yellow tail tacos:  i liked the spicy foam which added a nice kick to the citrus-ey flavors of the dish. \n(4) crab tempura: how ridiculous is it that there were only several pieces to each order so the hubs and i had to share one bite of one piece? this wouldn't even qualify as an amuse-bouche. \n(5) <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> and shrimp skewers: again, not enough so most of us shared skewers. \n(6) steak and mushroom stew: everyone got 1-2 thin slices of beef, which was tender and flavorful. \n(7) sushi rolls/sashimi: the sushi rolls were the most generous items served (about 5 cut rolls) but imo were rather underwhelming. the sashimi, on the other hand, was delicious and fresh. we were given about 3 slices each of yellowtail, tuna, and salmon which i easily could have eaten by myself.\n\ni felt bad for the hubs because he was still hungry and asked what was being served next, only to be told that it was just dessert followed by a $2500 bill ($240 per couple). \n\nyes, our server was pleasant and friendly. yes, the food was quite tasty.  and, yes, they need to recalculate the amount of food for groups ordering from the chef's selection. sure, i expected to pay a lot for this kind of meal, but what i didn't expect was to leave unsatisfied and wanting for more.",

            "celebrated a friend's 40th bday here.  service was good and the hosts friendly.  we were asked how much we wanted to spend, and we said about $50 pp (with tax and drinks, though, it came to be over $90 for those who ordered drinks and $80 for those who didn't).  they do their best to keep under or at your budget - and they did!  it's kinda cool bc they will add an extra piece of two depending on the size of your party and prorate the piece.  no more having to cut pieces because there's only four items and six people.\n\nhowever, i thought it was lame that i told them i was allergic to shrimp and they still brought out a dish with shrimp!  they asked what allergies we had, so i would assume when they do that, they will try to avoid bringing out anything with those items.  what's the point in asking what your allergies are if you don't adhere to them??  i should have asked to return it or taken off the bill - according to an email exchange with someone when reserving a table, it said we could return any dish we didn't enjoy.  the dish was good, but again, don't serve things people are allergic to after being told.\n\nanyway, most of the food was good, though there were a few misses.  we started with some tempura fried green beans and edamame - something we probably wouldn't have normally ordered since it seemed like filler food.  we all loved the scallop wrapped in what looked like a fried bird's nest.  so good.  the waguy dumplings were good but something we could have skipped.  also, another favorite was the <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> and <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark> - omg that was so delicious.  i could have eaten way more of that plate.  the <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark> kernels were really large and sweet.  the tuna tacos were another favorite.  we didn't like the beef and mushroom pot so much - had a strong coconut flavor, which i'm not a fan of.  we also got a plate of sushi, three different kinds.  one was good, but the rest were okay.  the banana boat dessert, though nice, wasn't that good.  we probably would have skipped it.  it was basically pieces of banana with torched sugar on top and ice cream, etc.  \n\ndrinks are expensive but really good here.  i recommend ordering the samba one was way better than mine, and in a really large glass!  it was fruity and fresh, and there was definitely alcohol in it.  i might go back one day if i win some money, but i'll prob stick to ordering the dishes myself.\n\noverall, the food was pretty good, but the price is pretty expensive for what you get.  i had expected a little more, i guess.", 
            "co-workers and i went for sushi one evening after work, and it was the best sushi i've ever had- an incredible experience. the service was outstanding, the food was a great mix of <mark><mark>Osetra Caviar Imperial 20g</mark> 20g</mark> <mark>Uni</mark> asian fusion. i recommend the <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>- the best i've ever had!", 
            "one of the many reasons i love the palazzo is the creepy-when-you-think-about-it facts that you can have a week long vacay and never really go outside. one of the other reasons i like the joint is... sushisamba. \n\nall fusion isn't created equal and most of what's deemed fusion in the multi-billion dollar tourist traps still doesn't cut it as top notch cuisine... but in three rotations over the years, the one thing i can say is that they've consistently delivered a good experience.  and that's more than i can say for a few others that are no longer at the palazzo.   it's also consistently noisy... do with that what you will. \n\nfavorites from the menu... <mark>Moqueca Mista</mark> (kinda hard to mess up fish stew with good ingredients ) and the <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> are my favorites of the full entries, which i wouldn't recommend on a first visit.  save big plates for your second or third go round.  almost anything with the w<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> is a hit; i think sushisamba drives the south american flavors home using fine japanese beef.  but if it works... \n\nthe yamato roll... epic as it is... to me, is **almost** overkill.  super indulgent <mark>Foie Gras</mark> and w<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> are almost a taste bud assault.   but at the same time, you have to try it-share it. the sa\\u00f5 paulo and the <mark>Neo Tokyo</mark> are my favorites here.   the <mark>Samba Strip</mark> is also pretty awesome.  again, pile enough good things together and see what happens. \n\nthe so so and not so on the menu... if anything ... rock shrimp (discontinued) and tiger <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark>.   mojitos are so so...( to me) as well.   the robata squid was literally hit and miss; had it once and it was great... and the next time... just rubber. \n\nall in all, come here with good company, a serious appetite and charge it to the room...i prefer early lunch or just after midnight.", 
            "jason, you are the man! thank you for making both this time and last time an incredible experience.\n\nreturned a month or so later, eager to try it out again next time i came back to vegas.\n\ni think this round somehow exceeding my experience last time. i got a lot of the same dishes, as well as tried out a few new ones and i was not dissapointed.\n\nour waitress was incredible and service was quick and enjoyable...even the parties next to us had a great time and sparked great conversation. the ambiance is hip and sexy while still being inviting and enjoyable.\n\nin addition to last time, we got the chuchumber cocktail which wasn't too sweet but amazingly refreshing. we also got the phyllo-wrapped scallop which at first i assumed would take away from the taste of the scallop but instead the combination of textures was just awesome. \n\nwe wanted to try one of the peruvian ceviches, so we went with the ginger/soy yellowfin one, which was pretty tasty but not quite up on the same level when it comes to crazy flavor profiles. \n\nthe other new dish we got was the <mark>Samba Strip</mark> roll. as somewhat of a sushi afficianado, i was excited to try it but not expecting a whole lot. crazy enough the lobster and mango combination with the peanut curry sauce was really crazy good. the roll also was made with some crispy rice and served with a meaty lobster claw so it was a solid choice. \n\nthe <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>, sashimi, and little kobe taquitos were just as good as i remembered them and was not let down.\n\nthank you to everyone at sushi samba for making it such a great second experience. i've already sent a number of friends over and i will definitely continue recommending more your way.", 
            "i'm always a little skeptical of asian fusion cuisine, but this place does it right! our waitress was very helpful in guiding us through the menu, pointing out the more popular items. it is a \"tapas\" style menu, the plates are small and meant to be shared! we ordered: \n\n-<mark>Seared W<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> Beef</mark> gyoza: i think this was the best thing we ordered! the beef was soooo good and i loved the sauces on the side. \n\n-<mark>Berkshire Pork Belly</mark> ramen: everything in the ramen was very traditional, but the broth was very different from your typical bowl. it had a hint of lemongrass and some heat, which my boyfriend and i really liked (it kind of reminded us of tom yum soup). \n\n-<mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> and shrimp skewers: both came with a side of <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark>! so yummy! these are supposedly the two most popular of the anticuchos. \n\n-lima roll: a pretty standard <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark> roll. i would have rather tried another one of their small plates or tempura instead. \n\nbetween two people this was more than enough food. overall, a really great and satisfying meal with <mark>Uni</mark> flavors!",

            "our server suggested to us that we simply trust him and he would put together a three course meal for us. we were on the fence as while he stated he could keep it to $50pp we were just looking for a good and inexpensive sushi dinner. well, thank god we trusted him! when the food came out the price seemed like a bargain. every course was about 3-5 things to share. the <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> and the gyoza were stand outs but literally everything was amazing. the cocktails were top notch. i paid the same price here for an amazing drink complete with a sugar cane and a banana leaf for the same price as a well drink most places on the strip. i would highly recommend this!", 
            "i came to this restaurant about a year ago for work related function.  at that time, my experience was very good, so i wanted to take my husband with me this time for him to experience the same.\n\nwhen we got there, the hostess set us at a table and asked us to move again because they had a reservation for party of 4, so they had to sit them there.  there were other tables with 4 people seats available, but we agreed to move.\n\nwhen i was here last time, the waiter was very nice and friendly and he had a good knowledge of the menu, especially the tasting menu options.  however, this time, we did not like our waitress.  when i decided to go there, i had tasting menu in my mind and i asked her to give me more explanations on that as i wasn't the one to order last time.   i am not sure if she was new to this place or not, but she seemed like she had no idea what the tasting menu entails or she didn't want to sell it.  she basically said that there are 3 courses and they can customize it if we had any preferences or allergies.  however, she did not say anything about what kind of foods will be on the tasting menu, whether they are from the regular menu vs off the menu items and even what kind of foods we will be served.  when i asked for difference between different tasting menu options, she basically said the quality of meat and fish are different.  everything she said was very vague.  \n\nalthough we still didn't really get much info that we wanted, since my experience last time was pretty good, we decided to do the tasting menu with the waygu hot stone bbq thing.  the few items that we got were tasty.  we liked w<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> dumpling and chilean <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> with corns.  their  ceviche taco thing was okay and we were not a big fan of the tuna appetizer that they brought out.  we got the w<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> bbq which i think is good to try it as a experience as the meat was tasty and it is a <mark>Uni</mark> experience but i am not too sure if it is worth it to pay $128 for 4 oz w<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> to grill it on a hot stone.  \n\nafter trying their tuna dish, we realized that we can have sushi in la too, so we asked the waitress to suggest something <mark>Uni</mark> to the restaurant rather than sushi or rolls which we can get other places for part of tasting menu as she said she can customize it for us. however, she couldn't really give us any suggestions or tell us how they can customize for us.  by then, we were not happy about the service and some of the foods that we tried, so we decided to cancel the tasting menu and pay for whatever we ate and left early.  \n\nmaybe my expectation was high for this place but i am really disappointed on their waitress' knowledge on their menu and some of the foods.  it was a very special night for us, so i really wanted it to be special but i have to say that dining at sushi samba definitely was not the highlight of our evening, rather more of a disappointment of the evening.  i saw every food item that we were served on the regular menu, so maybe it is better to stick with ordering off the menu rather than tasting menu and skip the w<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> hot stone bbq.  i won't be going back to this place in the future.\n\nfoods: 2.5 stars\natmosphere: 3 stars\nservice: 0 star\noverall experience: 1 star", 
            "i recently had one of the best meals of my life at sushisamba. i was visiting vegas on my own and decided to treat myself to a dinner at this restaurant that i used to love in chicago, before it shut down (sadly). it had been so long that i really got to try a lot of new things on the menu and i was in love with all of them.  i started out with a glass of sparkling rose because i'm classy like that. managers michael and jeremy gave me a primo spot to sip my bubbles and watch the fabulous crowd pour in for the dinner service. they also handed me a beautiful taster of their cucumber cocktail, which was fantastic. \n\nnext jeremy brought me over one of the yellow tail taquitos, which had a crisp shell and a flavorful foam to spoon on top. it was a great amuse bouche. along with that, i ordered the <mark>Seared W<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> Beef</mark> gyoza. the beef just melted in your mouth. it was so good. i tried to slow myself down to savor every bite of the tender meat in the dumplings. the sauce that came with them was also an integral part of their savory goodness. i think i could eat those dumplings every day until the day i die and still ask for them in heaven (or hell, depending on where i end up). \n\nthe next dish i ordered was the yamato sushi, which sounded like the absolute most decadent sushi roll i could ever possibly order. and it was. and i loved it. starting with white sushi rice, topped with flavorful fresh tuna, the smallest most perfect piece of <mark>Foie Gras</mark>, a dot of caviar, and topped with gold flake. i mean come on. i felt like the queen of sheba! each bite was a beautiful rich, even slightly sweet (from the sauce) morsel. it felt light and sinful at the same time.\n\nthen, michael stopped by to check on me and suggested i order the <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> robata. two skewers of meaty <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> grilled with a delicious miso sauce. they were the perfect bite to pair with the giant <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark> kernels served on the side. and i ordered mashed purple potatoes to top off the meal. everything was cooked to perfection. i just felt so grateful and happy to be there.\n\nwhen it came time for dessert, i was so full that all i wanted was coffee. so i ordered an espresso with a single scoop of chocolate ice cream, which was a great finish to an amazing meal. then michael and jeremy brought me one more surprise: an ice cream pop. mango ice cream covered with a white chocolate shell and graham cracker.\n\neverything was just awesome. michael and jeremy did a great job, as did my server, also named michael. amazing dinner in a really fun city. beautiful decor. they really made me feel right at home!",

            "i've stayed at the venetian/palazzo a dozen times and had never eaten at sushi samba. what a terrible mistake i've made all these years. looking for a restaurant in the hotel for our bachelor party, we decided upon sushisamba due to the variety of dishes, the vibrant atmosphere, and positive word of mouth reviews. we made a reservation through opentable, and were promptly seated upon arrival.\n\nsamba proclaims to have the most extensive sake selection in vegas, and we let our server choose a cheaper bottle for us and it was delicious. \n\n1) japanese a5 <mark>Seared W<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> Beef</mark> gyoza (4.5/5) - you get 5 delicious pot stickers with quality beef that just melts in your mouth\n\n2) yellowtail taquito (5/5) - there are two mandatory dishes to get and this is one of them. essentially a mini taco with yellowtail, roasted corn miso, and avocado. the explosion of flavor was mind-numbingly good and even friends who don't enjoy seafood loved this\n\n3) yellowtail sashimi (4.5/5) - 4 slices of high quality yellowtail, the sauce is delicate and sour\n\n4)  <mark>Berkshire Pork Belly</mark> (3.75/5) - i am admittedly biased towards <mark>Berkshire Pork Belly</mark> so i loved the dish. the butterscotch miso on top was a little overwhelming but the <mark>Berkshire Pork Belly</mark> itself was cooked to perfection\n\n5) <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> anticucho (5/5) - this is the other mandatory dish. we were very for<mark>Tuna</mark> because the table next to us came 15 minutes after and they ran out of this dish! the <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> skewer is  their signature dish and deservedly so. two skewers of <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> cooked so perfectly (soft on inside, slightly crispy exterior), there aren't enough superlatives to describe how delicious it is. \n\n6) <mark>Rio Grande</mark> (4/5) - from their churrasco menu, includes three types of meat: ribeye, chorizo, and w<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> picanha. i would not suggest this if you are eating by yourself or with another because it is just so much meat. in a larger group setting, i think this dish is perfect to share. the w<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> picanha is my favorite because the meat was so soft and tender.\n\nquite simply, i loved my experience at sushisamba. the service was fantastic. the food was <mark>Uni</mark> and delicious at the same time. the atmosphere embodies that of vegas- vibrant and exciting. the price of the dinner was what i'd expect from a \"strip\" restaurant, so be prepared to spend at least $50. \n\ni can't wait to go back to sushisamba for some yellowtail tacos and <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>.",

(to be honest, i just wanted to fill my stomach so that i'd be able to drink later!) luckily, one of our friends is a sushi samba master, and he did all of the ordering for our table. \n\ni pretty much loved everything - if only for the novelty of it all - but a few stand-out dishes were:\n1) yellowtail ceviche taquito: they looked like little yellowtail and guacemole tacos. somehow it all worked...\n2) yellowtail tiradito: kinda like a ceviche? yellowtail, jalepeno, and lemongrass - i'm definitely a fan of sour and spicy.\n3) fresh oysters and <mark><mark>Jumbo Shrimp</mark></mark>: no explanations needed.\n4) <mark>El Topo</mark> roll: salmon, jalepeno, melted cheese, and crispy onions\n\ni also would recommend getting a side of <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark> (which went along with our churrasco plate) just to see how huge those kernels are! it's kind of ridiculous. anyway, not only was the food great, but the service was among the best - they even have a \"sake sommelier\", so to speak. the place itself is energetic, contemporary, and very, very vegas. i can't wait to go back!", 
            "it's like eating sushi at a night club. really good sushi.\n\nthe ambiance is very contemporary with tons of lamps hanging from the ceiling. lighting is minimal. \n\nhere's the breakdown of the food that i tried.\n\n<mark>Tuna Tataki</mark>: very good. super fresh. i can't say it was the best that i have had but very close to it.\n\n<mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark>: this was an absolute favorite at the table. you have to try this! it's like tempura popcorn shrimp covered in a spicy alioli. \n\n<mark>Rio Grande</mark> three meats: all the meats were good. the dipping sauces made them fantastic. i wouldn't get this again though. not really great for how much it is.\n\nbobo brazil roll: really good! kobe beef on top....yum!\n\npacific: this was ok. nothing special about it. \n\nservice was fantastic! there was always someone out refilling glasses of water, beer, and sake and clearing out plates. very friendly too.", 
            "a friend of mine was raving about ss which set my expectations a bit high since he was industry folk but my experience was ok, sadly.  the space was cool in a japanimation type of way.  the temperature was a bit warm for a casino and music a bit blaring for my taste.  but what it really comes down to is the food, right?  the food was ok but not bad.  the <mark>Berkshire Pork Belly</mark> was incredibly delicious but the <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark> with truffle was soggy and didn't have the bite and crispy goodness a tempura typically has.  i just expected a bit more out of this brand name and really didn't do it for me.  i probably wouldn't go back.  there are plenty of other restaurants in vegas that are worth betting on.", 
            "went there for happy hour on a wed night. it was pretty dead by the time we got there. didn't like the mojito...  even though it was$6 only. the <mark>Salt and Pepper Squid</mark> was good. veggie tempura decent, chicken skewer was good and <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark> roll was terrible. service was pretty good.  enjoy", 
            "my dad picked out this place to go to dinner when he was in town this weekend.  i had never been, and i love sushi, so i was totally ok with his choice.\n\nwe arrived and looked at the menu, but ended up not needing it as we settled on the option our server gave to us... tell her our likes and dislikes, and they'd make a custom menu for us to try a bunch of everything.\n\nwhat followed was a lot of food that we would have never ordered... and we were delighted at the items they brought us.  our favorite was the chilean <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>, which was so tasty.  it came with <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark>, which is like huge overgrown corn.  we also really enjoyed the yellowtail seviche taquitos and the <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark>, as well as a few of the numerous sushi rolls they had brought at the end.  and our meal also included giant <mark><mark>Alaskan King Crab</mark> Leg</mark>, some peruvian sashimi, and at least one or two dishes i'm failing to remember.\n\nthe music was a little loud and not to my dad's taste, but that's typical in vegas.  the meal was definitely a <mark>Uni</mark> experience, and we wouldn't have stumbled upon half the dishes without letting the chef do his thing.  i highly recommend you dine in this fashion if you visit sushi samba.", 
            "excellent food, but it comes at a price. my boyfriend and i came here for what was supposed to be a light lunch, but we spent over $80 and still left hungry! but it's vegas, and it certainly wasn't the most expensive restaurant we came across. the menu didn't have as many sushi options as we expected- just the basics and a small list of specialty rolls. but there was a good variety of other fusion dishes, which seems to be the restaurant's main focus.\n\nmy boyfriend started off with the sawagani, which is flash fried japanese river crabs. basically, they're small (~1 inch) fried crabs that you eat whole. there was no way i was touching those things! i had the <mark>Tuna Tataki</mark>, which was very fresh and came in a tasty sauce.  we shared the <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark>, which came in larger sized pieces, and the <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> roll. both tasted fine. \n\nfor drinks, my boyfriend tried one of their shochus (not soju), a japanese drink similar to sake but tastes like vodka. prices ranged from $10-15 a glass, and it was pretty potent for a lightweight like me.\n\nservice was great. our server was attentive and had no problem explaining the items on the menu. atmosphere-wise, the interior has a nice, modern decor, but the music is really loud, and the lighting is very dim. overall, we had a good dining experience, and i would recommend trying this place if you have some money to spend!", 
            "my opinion/side note - i dont think its their sushi that makes this a good place to eat. but its the dishes that are not other sushi restaurant menus that makes it worth the cost.\n\nthis place is really good, only if you order the right things, because ordering something bad can cost you a pretty penny. i have been here twice and the 2nd time was much better because we all knew what we liked. \n\nthe chilean <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> on the robata grill section was probably my favorite rendition of chilean <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>. our waiter said the robata grill costs $1000 a day to operate? something like that. but wow it was good. you have to order off of this part of the menu if you are a fan of grilled food.\nprobably the only time i felt like a winner in vegas all weekend, just playing, kinda, lol.\n\nthe yellowfin taquitos were so <mark>Uni</mark>, and the foam chili sauce that came with it was the perfect compliment.\n\n<mark>El Topo</mark> - good but not great. table loved it though.\n\n<mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark> with black truffle aoili - if i ever make my dream of opening up a restaurant come true - this will be the first item on the menu. wowwww. it made a shrimp convert out of 1 the people at our table. but really how can u not like shrimp?\n\n\n-p", 
            "i had the chance to go back this past weekend and got a completely  different experience the second time around at sushi samba. \n\nafter a fun filled weekend adventure in vegas, we decided to give ss another shot. it was my cousin's birthday, and we figured we would stop by for a farewell vegas-birthday dinner. we stayed at the venetian, which made ss a stone throw away. we couldn't have came at a better time, the environment was so much more personal than the time before. i highly recommend avoiding peak dining hours if possible. this will give you time to enjoy your meal while getting some extra attention from servers. since we arrived at around 4pm on a sunday, the timing was perfect. \n\nour party grabbed a couple dishes and shared them all. this was the perfect way to sample everything. we started our mission into japanese/peruvian/brazilian adventure with...\n\notsumami: a mix of three appetizers. edamame, fried green beans, and grilled shishito peppers. my absolute favorite was the shishito peppers. they were doused in sea salt and lemon, and one out of every couple were spicy. perfect mix to the subtle hues of the edamame. \n\nyellowtail seviche: little tiny tacos filled with a mixture of yellowtail, onions, avocado and a side of chile sauce. these little babies packed a flavorful punch!\n\nnext up was the smoked <mark><mark>Alaskan King Crab</mark> Leg</mark>: wood fired, served in the half shell, perfectly cut and smothered in a signature sauce. these were so delicious and just melted in my mouth like butter!\n\nround four, <mark>Broiled Peruvian Bay Scallop</mark>: served in the shell as well, perfectly cooked. you can tell that they know how to prepare their seafood because everything tasted so fresh. this was my cousin's favorite dish and her first time ever trying <mark>Scallop</mark>. \n\nthen came out the <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark>. we could hardly eat anymore, however we asked for the most flavorful, scrumptious items, and intended on finishing them! after that, the yellowtail sashimi. it had spicy blended orange sauce on it, that was the perfectly paired with the fish. my personal fave of the night. \n\nmake sure to order a signature cocktail while you are there. we had a couple (after all, what kind of birthday is complete without drinks?), and the one that really stood out was the chu-cumber. it was like you were drinking the most exquisite cup of tea mixed with the cool tones of cucumber, all while getting a little buzz on. \n\nmy taste buds are so happy that i gave sushi samba another shot. the best part was, management remembered that it was my cousin's birthday, and brought out a little slice of carrot cake with ice cream and sparklers crowning the top. it was definitely a birthday dinner that we will all remember.", 
            "chilean <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> skewers with miso - absolutely delicious!  the <mark><mark>Jumbo Shrimp</mark></mark> with passionfruit ceviche -- original and delightful.  my husband's favorite dish was the <mark>Tuna Tataki</mark> .  we came here because i had a taste for sushi and it was the highest ranked by yelpers.  when we arrived, the bar atmosphere caused us to question the yelp reviews but after eating we agree.  the sushi rolls aren't that great (we tried the <mark>Samba Strip</mark> and <mark>El Topo</mark>) but they weren't horrible.  the servers are familiar with the entire menu so if you don't have a specific taste for something, feel free to ask them for their suggestion. they'll have a ton.  also, their drinks are good but lean away from being sweet.  i had to have them muddle more sugar and mint to flavor up my drink a little more because it just tasted like rum with a little mint when they first brought it out.  this is a tapas place so you can easily order 4 plates per person which can get pricey.  but highly recommend for their chilean <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> skewers.  i haven't had <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> this good since g. garvin's restaurant in west los angeles closed a few years ago.  outstanding.",

            "omg, is it possible to be this good?  3 times there now and 3 times i have been equally impressed.  one thing that has been a constant on all 3 visits has been the great service i received.  our waiters always their menu's and made fantatsic recommendations.  this time i had the tempura greenbeans with a truffle oil dipping sauce (delicous!), berkshire pork gyoza and <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark> (at the recommend of our server)  everything was well prepared and efficiently served.  sushi samba is now a place that i can truly call home for great sushi.  as you can tell by my reviews, its safe to say that i am a fan.",

            "these 5 stars goes to the lady who was so damn good at her job by fulfilling every aspect of our dining experience that the food was more like a plus. i wish i got her name to credit her but we were a party of 8 girls staggering in late in high heels for our dear friend's bachelorette reserved dinner on a saturday night a week ago.\nwe got the run down quickly on doing their style of \"omakase\" after mentioning we had a show and had to finish by 9pm. we gave her free rein with a price per person between $30 to $40.\nnow, i was the only one who had been here before for the same concept so i was expecting the same good service and food. so i discreetly asked the lady server to make sure to add the miso <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> skewers. she happily replied, \"i gotchu girl!\" \nwe were then offered the extensive sake and wine menu, which we had to forgo. and one of the girls almost ordered the cucumber martini but didn't.  \nafter the time it took for a buzzed dude to walk over, show us his awesome swim trunks, (clearly forgetting to dress his bottoms to match his sharp shirt), wink and share a charming smile, and then leave...our appetizers were presented by a team of 3 servers.\n- otsumami: trio of edamame, tempura green beans with amazing truffle dip, grilled shishito pepper :)\n- pork gyozas (ok)\n- <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark> (wasn't as succulent or saucy but still good)\n\nour waters were always filled. thank you water guy!\n\nthen after enjoying our appz for about 20 mins, came out the yummiful skewers, 3 specialty rolls of sushi (could have asked for the <mark>El Topo</mark> roll but decided try the others) and an entree split by 2 plates to share. it was the teriyaki chicken with fried onions atop mashed purple potatoes. this is so yum because the chicken was juicy and flavorful!\n\nwe were having our fill and we were on schedule. then the lady server got us a surprise sake tree of their cucumber martini! also very refreshing and yum to end our meal.  we had to pack a bit of to-go and we were happy with the service. she lined our meal down the middle of our price range to about $36/person (plus tax+tip $45).\nso exceeded my last experience here!  i recommend the omakase style because the servers really do know the menu. trust!", 
            "my husband and i looked at an address wrong for a restaurant we were going to try.  long story short, we were at the wrong casino.  we decided to stay at palazzo.  we love the palazzo and have never had a bad experience here and figured we couldn't go wrong.  however, this is my least favorite dining expereince i've had to the venetian or palazzo.\n\nsushisamba was having their happy hour on friday 4-7.  we sat up at the bar and ordered off their happy hour menu.  we each decided to try the caipirinhas.  i'd equate this to a brazilian margarita.  i think the bartender said it has rum instead of tequila???  not positive though.  she hands the drinks to us and says something to the effect of \"this isn't my favorite drink, but it gets the job done\".  we didn't ask her if it was a good, bad or indifferent drink.  we just wanted to try something off their happy hour menu that we'd never tried before.  i thought it was a rather odd comment to make.  then when we tried it, we weren't crazy about it either.  if she was going to say something, she should've told us when we ordered.  regardless, the drink kind of grew on us.  didn't order a second and probably won't order the drink again, but it wasn't horrible.\n\nas far as food, we tried the chicken anticuchos, <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark> roll, salmon taquitos and yellowtail seviche.  chicken anticuchos were good....basically a chicken skewer with teriyaki.  <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark> roll was average.  salmon taquitos were kind of strange...if you do order these, make sure to put the spicy sauce on them.  without the sauce, they aren't very good.  last but not least, the dish i truly enjoyed was the yellowtail seviche.  the yellowtail was buttery and spicy all at the same time....very good.\n\nall said and done, our tab was just under $40 before tip.  not bad.  however, there was something about this place, i don't see myself ever coming back here.  other than the yellowtail, nothing was that good.  average to mediocre at best.",

            "this restaurant caught my eye because it was something out of the ordinary from your typical sushi restaurant. the menu offered an intriguing variety but when i began reading the reviews i knew i had to try it. i would suggest anyone going there for the first time to try the dining experience because you may think you know what you want but the chef knows better! the server asks if there is anything you do not like or if you have any food allergies and then how much money per person you're looking to spend. there are options anywhere from $50 per person to $130 per person if kobe beef if something that interests you. as it was for a special occasion we opted for $80 per person and even though thats more than i have probably ever spent on a single meal there were no regrets.\n\ncourse #1 consisted of berkshire pork gyoza which is basically pork dumplings in a pumpkin puree and yellowtail ceviche taquitos, both of which were absolutely delicious and not necessarily something i would have ordered on my own.\n\ncourse #2 was yellowtail sashimi in a spicy peruvian sauce with a slice of red jalapeno on top and octopus sashimi in a japanese citrus sauce which again were both to die for!\n\ncourse #3 had an array of <mark>Filet Mignon</mark>, <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>, <mark>Alaskan King Crab</mark> and <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark>. all were moist and tender but the <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> absolutely melted in your mouth! <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark> was a yummy alternative to <mark><mark>Osetra Caviar Imperial 20g</mark> 20g</mark> as well.\n\nfinally, course #4 was the main sushi dinner. <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark> rolls were delicious, but the <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> with i believe tuna on top was absolutely amazing! there was also <mark>Half Maine Lobster</mark> and another roll which i believe had lobster in it as well and was probably the only thing of the entire dinner that i was not absolutely amazed with, but it was still good!\n\nanother great thing about this place is they tell you if there is anything throughout this meal you do not like they will take it back and bring you something else! as our server said, \"its like a money back guarantee!\"\n\nanyways this is definitely a place i would tell everyone who loves trying new things to try or even just the sushi lover. do it! it will not disappoint!\n\nonly part i would complain about is the fact that there is not one in california!!!",

( yes she threw the menus!) we then proceeded to wait a good 15 minutes before anyone would come over and talk to us....not even give us water. finally our waitress came over and apologized and we were ready to order drinks and edamame. our drinks came quickly and we ordered the rest of our dinner with some suggestions from our waitress. our first to appetizers came pretty fast as well but the waitress for got we wanted edamame so that came later in the meal. the oysters were awesome...the yellowtail with jalape\\u00f1o was amazing.....sushi rolls were good but the <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark> was off....taste just wasn't there ( taste not spice.....it was basically no flavor but spicy). our waitress talked up the mini doughnuts for dessert so we ordered them...only to find out they were out.\nour bill was over 200$ and i left disappointed at that price.\non a side note the hostess tried to seat 3 other couples at the original table she wanted to give us and all 3 couple asked for different tables.....it wasn't a busy night.....she may want to take a step back and remember she is the first person people see....she needs to represent this restaurant better.",

            "oh. my. god. i want to eat here every day of my life, if only for the ishi yaki. my wallet is already throwing a fit about the thought of how quickly i would go broke, but akdsjhfakjldhf. words cannot describe how much i want to go back and eat all the things. well more specifically, all the ishi yaki.\n\nin reality though, sushisamba is unfor<mark>Tuna</mark> a sometimes food (unless you're a bajillionaire, in which case, dine on! i will live vicariously through you). it's just too expensive for me, as a student to afford. thank goodness someone else was picking up the check when i went.\n\nmy family and i had our christmas dinner here at like... 9pm (yea, we did christmas in vegas). it was by far, the fanciest christmas dinner i have ever had. \n\nwe were seated in the back room area since we had a relatively large party, but since it was so late, it was mostly empty there, which was simultaneously nice and eery. our waiter suggested we do the tasting menu, where he and the chef craft our meal for us, but since my mom had just been here with some colleagues the week before, we decided to just let her order for us, since she knew what was good. \n\n- <mark>Salt and Pepper Squid</mark>: the seasoning made this extra delicious-- a really good starter\n- crispy yellowtail taquitos: also yummy, though i may be biased because yellowtail is one of my favorite fish; very lime-y\n- <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark>: a twist on regular tempura, but absolutely delicious; if you don't like spicy mayo, maybe not your thing\n- ishi yaki: words cannot describe. <mark>Grade A5</mark>5 japanese waygu that you cook yourself on a hot japanese river stone? yes, please! you take a slice of meat, dip it in oil, and then put it on the hot stone to let it cook. there's a few different dipping sauces and three different types of salt that you can add to your meat. all of them are delicious, though i am partial to the black salt. there were some pears on the plate, so i was like what the heck, why not cook those on the stone too. still delicious. even thinking about this is making me crave it. the ishi yaki is really expensive, but if you're going to go for any of the japanese waygu options, go for this one because it is definitely the most <mark>Uni</mark>.\n- we ordered a bunch of sushi rolls, which were good, but not the most amazing ones i've ever had.\n- also, the lychee bubbletail is really good. the alcohol is not overpowering, it's not too sweet, and they put a real lychee (probably from a can) in it.\n\nrandom: i really like the music on their website... that probably sounds really weird, but it's true. love it.\n\ntl;dr: i know for a fact that the main reason why i love sushisamba as much as i do is because i was not paying. it was a crazy expensive meal, but it was delicious because we ordered some rather expensive (but good! oh so very good!) things. if you're not willing to splurge, you'll probably think i'm crazy for giving them a 5-star review, but if you are, be prepared to be amazed. just don't think about the check. and get the ishi taki. 5-stars for that alone.", 
            "wandered in here without a plan for a first time meet up.\n\nthough my eyes were not necessarily on the food, i noted a few things, sitting at a table vs. sitting at the sushi bar: the emphasis was on the fusion foods (sushi menu was backpage) and the drink menu was bigger than the food menu. i agree with bunny g. that no one bothered to explain anything about the menus.\n\nordered their house ice tea which is a mint tea arnold palmer, served with lemon & lime wedges.  very tasty & refreshing since i don't think i've ever had an arnie with mint tea.\n\nthe edamame was standard fare, served cool with crushed rock salt sprinkled on top.  i ordered 2 rolls, <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark> (6 pcs), and a <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> (8 pcs).  the <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark> was exactly that, no fuss, frills, standouts.  the <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark>, i think was just a tuna roll served with a squirt of sriracha.  good thing i wasn't there for the food!\n\nthe decor & service were exceptional and it looked like there was a special/private dining area in the back.  interesting decor that isn't particular of any single culture, or at least any that i know of.  there were these wooden chairs that looked to be carved out of giant coconuts but could really only seat an ommpa loompa.  another strange touch, that doesn't quite work to me: the food menus were not on the small side, but the cover was like leather, as in, not self supporting.  the only way to read the menu, that didn't feel awkward, was to lay it on the table.  for some reason, i didn't want a leather menu touching my little appetizer plate.  it seems unsanitary.\n\nbecause the prices were so high, i rate the food a 2-2.5 stars, but the decor & service a solid 4 stars.  so, 3.33 stars, it is!", 
            "i wanted to give this 4.5 stars, but i'll round down. came here with my sister for a convention in vegas, we walked around the venetian and pallazzo for a while until we finally decided on sushisamba.  first of all, the restaurant is beautiful. i really love the wall painings, interior design, and the bathroom design was really cool as well. service here was excellent, my water was always full, when i got up to use the restroom i placed my napkin on the table, when i came back it was neatly folded back for me. \n\nwe decided to get two appetizers. first the <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark>... really no point in ordering this. tempura taste the same everywhere, nothing special about theirs. we also tried the taquitos as suggested by the waitress. these were really just mini taco's. main lobster and yellowtail. both were nice and chilled taco's. good sauce on the side. not sure if i'd order them again, but they were decent.\n\nfor dinner my sister ordered their miso marinated chilean <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>. this was absolutely excellent. the fish was cooked perfectly, it was so soft and delicious. it's served with vegetables and those were pretty good too. possibly the post chilean <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> i've ever had. \n\nfor my dinner i decided to order two rolls, the <mark>Neo Tokyo</mark> and the bobo brazil. the <mark>Neo Tokyo</mark>, which is bigeye tuna and tempura flake was delicious. the little sauce on top was a nice spicy sauce. this roll was very delicious. as for the bobo brazil.... quite gross, too much avocado, wayyy too much in fact, in overpowered the entire roll. both regular avocado and some mushy avocado. in addition the red onion also gave it some very odd taste. this was one of the worst sushi rolls i have ever eaten.\n\nfor dessert we ordered the samba split for two. it was really good, and a decent sized portion. everything on the plate complemented each other and the banana brulee was fantastic.",

            "i came for a bachelorette party last week on friday night around 11pm. my review is probably (ok definitely) biased because i was in such a bad mood at having to wait until 11pm to eat dinner. however, as you might imagine, 5 girls using one bathroom getting ready to go out in vegas is a production equal to cirque de solei that takes upward of 3 hours. but whatever we finally made it after a 15 minute, mile long cab ride down the strip from the cosmo to the palazzo hotel.  the restaurant was super dark (why don't they turn some lights on?) with huge tvs which were super loud. per the usual at many \"sceney\" type restaurants you could barely here the people across the table from you. \n\nwe got seated no problem as the restaurant was dead except for two or three big groups getting wasted in booths and a few lonely looking stragglers at the bar. our server was friendly but seemed to constantly be in a rush, although to go where i do not know. there seemed to be a ton of bus boys but very few wait staff. he could probably sense our frustration so he promptly brought out a wrought iron tree full of pink drinks. whether or not they had liquor was the only question (answer: not enough.) so we got a range of drinks, the best of which was a cucumber lime martini with vodka. after the night's beginning, i opted with straight vodka and diet coke.\n\nfor food we got a lot. some  memorable dishes were the <mark>Neo Tokyo</mark> roll with tuna which was solid, <mark>Heirloom Tomato Salad</mark> with sweet cilantro dressing, <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark>, <mark>Mushroom Tobanyaki</mark>, and sweet <mark>Coconut Rice</mark> side. my fave dish of all was the <mark>Heirloom Tomato Salad</mark> which was pricey but enough to share between 3 people. the rock shrimp was good but cliched, same as you would get anywhere else. the <mark>Mushroom Tobanyaki</mark> was interesting but not to my taste.  sadly we did not get dessert. \nin conclusion, i can definitely say i hope i will never be back with another bachelorette party, although i would not mind returning otherwise.",

            "i give <mark>Crispy Hokkaido Scallop</mark> 5 stars, rainbow hexagon roll 4.5 stars and 5stars for the sashimi. but we waited for the <mark>Berkshire Pork Belly</mark> ramen for at least 30 mins. while we were still eating the waitress placed our bill on our table. so rude!! stone <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark> tastes weird and is not the regular fluffy crispy tempura i've seen before. pricey. ewwwwwwwww i gave them a minimum of 15%tip. i wish i could give them 0 dollars tip.", 
            "it was fantastic!!  my girl and i went for dinner and drinks and had a blast.  everyone was beyond cool including our hostess and waitress.  our waitress was honest about everything and was not trying to get me to order a bunch of extra stuff.  we got the scallop small plate- amazing, <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark>- amazing, chilean <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> w/ <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark>- amazing fish and the corn was something new (not for me,) and the lima roll- very good!!!!  for drinks we has the pisco punch - yes please and 2 shots of some pink vodka goodness our waitress recommended.  everything was top notch.  the place is hip, trendy, what you want from a vegas dinner/pre-drink spot.  gals, including ourselves were decked out and fab!!  we made friends with the chicks next to us, was just so much fun.  the tables are close to one another, but we didn't mind at all.  \n\nto top the evening off, and these are the things that i remember, my eyelash was falling off (hahahaha!)  i couldn't get it back on and asked the hostess if she had any glue since i could see her huge gorgeous eyelashes were false as well.  she hooked me up!!  i was good to go!!!  \n\nthanks sushi samba!!  great evening!\n\nbtw- this place is $$$$ but we knew that going in.  \n\nloved it!!!!!!", 
            "since we were staying in the palazzo, i figured it would be easiest to dine in the hotel our first night in vegas. sushisamba sounded like a really interesting fusion of brazilian, peruvian, and japanese cuisine.\n\ninside i found a very lively, posh atmosphere. there was great music playing, giving it more of a club ambiance than that of a restaurant. i also liked the graffiti paint job on the walls. our waitress was tremendous, and the manager came to check on us periodically too. they definitely aren't lacking in the service department. all in all, this was a really enjoyable place to eat dinner.\n\nwe decided to go tapas style and order a bunch of different things to try. my dinner companion didn't have any preferences, so i ordered two small plates (<mark>Seared W<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> Beef</mark> <mark>Salt and Pepper Squid</mark>), two kinds of sashimi tiradito (kanpachi and tuna), and two samba rolls (<mark>Samba Strip</mark> roll and <mark>Sasa Handroll</mark>).\n\nour small plates came out first. i was excited to try the <mark>Seared W<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> Beef</mark>, which comes with a ponzu gelee, honshimeji mushrooms, and a truffled tofu crema. the meat was amazingly tender, and i liked the acidity of it all. even the mushrooms were very flavorful. the <mark>Salt and Pepper Squid</mark> was also very good. it comes with dry miso, shichimi, sea salt, crispy garlic, and smoked soy. this dish was definitely spicy. it was like calamari, but way better.\n\nnext up was the sashimi tiradito. the kanpachi (amberjack) comes with yuzu, sea salt, and black truffle oil. it was absolutely packed with flavor, and i enjoyed the saltiness of it. the tuna is served in a ceviche-style bath of granny smith apple, serrano peppers, and lime. it was beautifully sweet and spicy at the same time.\n\nwe were getting a little full, but we still had two samba rolls to go. the <mark>Samba Strip</mark> roll is a combination of <mark>Half Maine Lobster</mark>, mango, tomato, crispy rice, soy paper, and peanut curry. i absolutely loved the mango in there, which paired nicely with the peanut. the <mark>Sasa Handroll</mark> was very different from what you might expect sushi to be. it comes with <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark>, quinoa, shishito, cilantro, spicy mayonnaise, and red onion wrapped in some sort of cone. our waitress suggested we get two, since it's not very conducive to sharing. i agree. the sasa roll was a little difficult to eat, but well worth the effort. \n\ni didn't think we had waited very long for our dinner at all, but nonetheless the manager thought so, and to make up for it she brought over complimentary green tea sorbet pops for dessert. to put it mildly, they were amazing!\n\nsushisamba was absolutely top notch all the way around.", 
            "food was great!! we especially loved the <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark>. service was pretty quick. definitely a loud restaurant, so conversations are hard to hear. i'd recommend it to friends.", 
            "one of the many reasons i love the palazzo is the creepy-when-you-think-about-it facts that you can have a week long vacay and never really go outside. one of the other reasons i like the joint is... sushisamba. \n\nall fusion isn't created equal and most of what's deemed fusion in the multi-billion dollar tourist traps still doesn't cut it as top notch cuisine... but in three rotations over the years, the one thing i can say is that they've consistently delivered a good experience.  and that's more than i can say for a few others that are no longer at the palazzo.   it's also consistently noisy... do with that what you will. \n\nfavorites from the menu... <mark>Moqueca Mista</mark> (kinda hard to mess up fish stew with good ingredients ) and the <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> are my favorites of the full entries, which i wouldn't recommend on a first visit.  save big plates for your second or third go round.  almost anything with the w<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> is a hit; i think sushisamba drives the south american flavors home using fine japanese beef.  but if it works... \n\nthe yamato roll... epic as it is... to me, is **almost** overkill.  super indulgent <mark>Foie Gras</mark> and w<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> are almost a taste bud assault.   but at the same time, you have to try it-share it. the sa\\u00f5 paulo and the <mark>Neo Tokyo</mark> are my favorites here.   the <mark>Samba Strip</mark> is also pretty awesome.  again, pile enough good things together and see what happens. \n\nthe so so and not so on the menu... if anything ... rock shrimp (discontinued) and tiger <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark>.   mojitos are so so...( to me) as well.   the robata squid was literally hit and miss; had it once and it was great... and the next time... just rubber. \n\nall in all, come here with good company, a serious appetite and charge it to the room...i prefer early lunch or just after midnight.", 
            "the bartenders were friendly. the food was ok. i was expecting better flavor and quality for the price, but since i got to try things during their \"samba hour,\" it was worth it. we ordered from both the happy hour and regular menus and tried the amazonia, <mark>El Topo</mark>, <mark>Rainbow Dragon</mark>, and <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark> rolls, as well as the calamari and gyoza appetizers. the japanese-south american fusion is creative, but again, the quality is ok. my favorite of the bunch was the gyoza. 5 stars if you come during the samba hour because this place is a steal in vegas with the prices for the drinks and food. outside of samba hour, the quality doesn't justify the prices, so 3 stars overall.", 
            "i'm always a little skeptical of asian fusion cuisine, but this place does it right! our waitress was very helpful in guiding us through the menu, pointing out the more popular items. it is a \"tapas\" style menu, the plates are small and meant to be shared! we ordered: \n\n-<mark>Seared W<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> Beef</mark> gyoza: i think this was the best thing we ordered! the beef was soooo good and i loved the sauces on the side. \n\n-<mark>Berkshire Pork Belly</mark> ramen: everything in the ramen was very traditional, but the broth was very different from your typical bowl. it had a hint of lemongrass and some heat, which my boyfriend and i really liked (it kind of reminded us of tom yum soup). \n\n-<mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> and shrimp skewers: both came with a side of <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark>! so yummy! these are supposedly the two most popular of the anticuchos. \n\n-lima roll: a pretty standard <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark> roll. i would have rather tried another one of their small plates or tempura instead. \n\nbetween two people this was more than enough food. overall, a really great and satisfying meal with <mark>Uni</mark> flavors!", 
            "me and my wife came here for lunch and loved it. \nwe ordered green tea and was very good quality. \ni was reading other reviews and everyone mentioned the <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> skewers and <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark>. it was pretty good. <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> was very yummy but i would prefer to have less sauce. the yellow tail tacos were also very good and fresh. my favourite was the <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark>. just the right mix of sauce batter and shrimp. we ordered the <mark>El Topo</mark> sushi to top things off and it was not bad but wish i had more room to try other stuff. will definitely recommend and will come back for sure.", 
            "we started our happy hour with several nina frescas and classic mojitos.  fresh strawberry pur\\u00e9e, vodka, orange liquor, and guava.  spectacular and they were only $6 each. next we sampled <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> roll, <mark>Salt and Pepper Squid</mark>, w<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> goya, <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark> roll, chicken anticuchos, and yellow tiradito sashimi. everything was amazingly prepared and all of our choices were perfectly flavored. we sat at the bar and brian explained the menu in detail, recommended drinks, and made sure our service was on point.  everyone at the restaurant was friendly and focused on customer service.  the music and atmosphere was hip and entertaining.  we will be back on our next vegas trip. you can also ask for jason; he will make sure that all of your detailed requests are handled."

            "when we were in vegas in november, we decided to dine at sushi samba one night since we were staying at the palazzo. the restaurant is tucked away in the corner and has a dark sexy vibe to it. we had 6:30 pm reservations on a friday night and since it was a little early, the restaurant was not overly busy which allowed us to receive a lot of attention from mike, our waiter. he was one of the best waiters i have had in a restaurant in a long time...he was very helpful in helping us select a bottle of sake and made recommendations on the food and how many plates to order for our group of 5. plus he checked on us often enough so we didn't sit with empty glasses, but not too much where it was annoying.\n\nthe food was amazing for the most part. the <mark>Scallop</mark> and chicken robota were my two favorite things that we ordered that evening. the <mark>Scallop</mark> were cooked perfectly and were not gritty at all. they didn't quite have that melt in my mouth feeling, but were some of the best i have had since moving to the southwest. my husband sampled some of the sushi that our group ordered, and even as a sushi newcomer, he was not blown away by it. it was probably the most disappointing of the dishes that our group ordered. our group received three complimentary desserts (we were celebrating 3 birthdays that evening) of which the chocolate hazelnut dish was my favorite. it was absolutely heavenly.\n\nour group's bill came to approximately $200, which i thought was reasonable given the number of dishes we ordered, plus we also had a bottle of sake ($62 itself), and several other alcoholic beverages. sushi samba is definitely a great restaurant for those dining in a group because the circular booths are large and perfectly designed for chatting with the person next to you or across the table. i will definitely dine again at sushi samba on a future trip to vegas.", 
            "we ordered the chef's assortment of rolls -- which were, to our pleasant surprise, actual rice paper wraps filled with <mark>Scallop</mark>, tuna, and salmon.\n\nexcellent service, chic feel, and sushi is among the best i've had anywhere on either coast (san francisco and new york).", 
            "very cool decor and great service.  some of the dishes, including the rock shrimp with peas, were great.  others, like the <mark>Scallop</mark> with foam and the ceviche, were just not.  it's pretty expensive, but worth a visit if you can justify the price.  just do your research on here for the best dishes before ordering.", 
            "what a great dinner to end the weekend!!!\n\ncame here for a bachelorette party dinner and we did the tasting menu for about $75 per person with tax and tip in the end.  \n\nthe tasting menu allowed us to try a variety of dishes but a lot of them too!  so much that in the end, i was too full to finish my portion!\n\ni thought the service here was more than awesome! before they started to bring out the food, they went around to ask about people's allergies and who doesn't like sushi and things like that.  after getting it all down, they proceeded to bring out food.  if they were to bring out something that had something that someone was allergic to, then that person would get a substituted dish!  i thought that was pretty awesome!\n\nwe got so many that i can't remember them all but i'll list out the ones i do remember!\n\ntuna tartar -delish!\n<mark>Scallop</mark> - double delish!\nsashimi - delish delish!\n<mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> - the best of the night! delish delish delisssh!\ntacos - spicy!!\nsteak filet - it was ook, a bit on the dry side for my taste\n<mark>Peruvian Corn</mark> - this was pretty interesting!\ngyoza - very big and delish pieces!\nvegetable rolls - the sesame dipping sauce was pretty good!\n\ni'm sure there were more but i wasn't disappointed with any! everything was good!  \n\nthe dessert i could have passed on, it was fondue. i think i'm not such a big fan of fondue! \n\nbut i would definitely come here again!", 
            "this place rocks! located at the palazzo, the place meets vegas expectations- extreme.  the decor was fancy, the waitresses/hostess- hot. here is what i ordered:\n\nmiso encrusted sea-bass robata; duck robata; hamachi jalapeno and lemon grass; <mark>Tuna Tataki</mark>; hamachi ceviche\n\n     of everything, the sea-bass was the best- hands down. probably the best i've ever had.  the waiter happened to recommend the sea-bass over the <mark>Scallop</mark> for taste & portion size. good call on his part, showing me that the staff is educated and willing to make suggestions.  the hamachi and lemon grass was great.  <mark>Tuna Tataki</mark>- was ok, not great, not bad, the hamachi ceviche was tasty as well. \n     friends suggested the peruvian plate- enough for two, but i was too interested in the menu selection to choose otherwise. he did goto sushisamba a bit after me, and ordered it again, so it must be worthwhile.\n     overall it was a great dining experience. i will definitely be back for more. i will probably make this a staple for dining everytime i head back to las vegas.", 
            "i had the chance to go back this past weekend and got a completely  different experience the second time around at sushi samba. \n\nafter a fun filled weekend adventure in vegas, we decided to give ss another shot. it was my cousin's birthday, and we figured we would stop by for a farewell vegas-birthday dinner. we stayed at the venetian, which made ss a stone throw away. we couldn't have came at a better time, the environment was so much more personal than the time before. i highly recommend avoiding peak dining hours if possible. this will give you time to enjoy your meal while getting some extra attention from servers. since we arrived at around 4pm on a sunday, the timing was perfect. \n\nour party grabbed a couple dishes and shared them all. this was the perfect way to sample everything. we started our mission into japanese/peruvian/brazilian adventure with...\n\notsumami: a mix of three appetizers. edamame, fried green beans, and grilled shishito peppers. my absolute favorite was the shishito peppers. they were doused in sea salt and lemon, and one out of every couple were spicy. perfect mix to the subtle hues of the edamame. \n\nyellowtail seviche: little tiny tacos filled with a mixture of yellowtail, onions, avocado and a side of chile sauce. these little babies packed a flavorful punch!\n\nnext up was the smoked <mark><mark>Alaskan King Crab</mark> Leg</mark>: wood fired, served in the half shell, perfectly cut and smothered in a signature sauce. these were so delicious and just melted in my mouth like butter!\n\nround four, <mark>Broiled Peruvian Bay Scallop</mark>: served in the shell as well, perfectly cooked. you can tell that they know how to prepare their seafood because everything tasted so fresh. this was my cousin's favorite dish and her first time ever trying <mark>Scallop</mark>. \n\nthen came out the <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark>. we could hardly eat anymore, however we asked for the most flavorful, scrumptious items, and intended on finishing them! after that, the yellowtail sashimi. it had spicy blended orange sauce on it, that was the perfectly paired with the fish. my personal fave of the night. \n\nmake sure to order a signature cocktail while you are there. we had a couple (after all, what kind of birthday is complete without drinks?), and the one that really stood out was the chu-cumber. it was like you were drinking the most exquisite cup of tea mixed with the cool tones of cucumber, all while getting a little buzz on. \n\nmy taste buds are so happy that i gave sushi samba another shot. the best part was, management remembered that it was my cousin's birthday, and brought out a little slice of carrot cake with ice cream and sparklers crowning the top. it was definitely a birthday dinner that we will all remember.", 
            "i went here last night (4th of july weekend) for dinner with my man and 4 friends of ours...amazing! our waitress tanice was absolutely wonderful and she put together a 10 course meal for my table based on our preferances. every single thing she brought out was pure delight in your mouth...the <mark>Scallop</mark> with pesto sauce were excellent, these small tuna \"tacos\" were amazing, and the chilean <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> skewers were the best fish i have ever had, hands down. all entrees were served family style and the brazilian/sushi flare to the food was exciting for my taste buds. we got a shot tower (12 shots) for our table and the cucumber martini and sangria shots that came on it were super delicious. the manager liza came over, pleasantly introduced herself, and checked our table frequently to make sure our meal was perfect. this place is a must for some fun, fine dining in las vegas. the ambience is dark, red and trendy in a classy way. it also was kinda cool to see shawn marion sitting at the table next to us. come eat here and ask for tanice and liza: you won't be disappointed.", 
            "sushi samba is such a young and hip restaurant with urban japanese art all over the restaurant which is accompanied by loud upbeat music. the crowd here is pretty young and pretty drunk. haha. the table sitting next to me was cackling the entire time, but i didn't mind. anyways, enough about the ambiance and decor, let's talk about the food and mannnnn did me and my sister order kind of a lot. the plates are kind of tapas style so you kinda have to order a lot.\n\nmy sister and i were overly excited about sushi samba being a japanese, peruvian, and brazilian restaurant. we ordered a little bit of everything. so here it is:\n\n- chicken skewers with <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark> and <mark>Scallop</mark>: very very tasty. chicken was tender and grilled to perfection! <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark>, who knew such a thing existed, but nonetheless like ordinary corn. i especially liked the <mark>Scallop</mark> because they were lemony and the presentation was so pretty!\n- <mark><mark>Jumbo Shrimp</mark></mark> ceviche: way too sweet\n- tuna ceviche: tuna was fresh and soft, not too sweet, but not too bland. \n2 sushi rolls, but i forgot the name, but one of them included kobe beef, i think the bobo brazil... and that one was amazing!\n- <mark>Tuna Tataki</mark>: must order. good presentation, perfect balance of crisp and soft. tuna was tasty\n- <mark>Seared W<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> Beef</mark>: the sauce accompanying this dish is so perfect. the beef and mushroom was so good. \n \nalso try the dessert!\n\nwe ordered more stuff, but don't wanna drag this review on. just know that you should come here before a night of dancing and drinking because sushi samba is the perfect place to fill your belly and pre-game!", 
            "i was pleasantly surprised by the quality of food at sushisamba. my friend who was there before, ordered for all of us and his choices were impeccable. we started out with a house complimentary appetizer  of <mark>Scallop</mark> with pesto and the feast continue on. top dishes for me were sauteed hamachi and <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> skewers that we washed down with an excellent bottle of a cold pressed sake.the restaurant decor is  a bit dark but very pleasing on the eye with video of brazil and peru projected on walls. the only downside to the dining experience was service that started out a bit rough but then picked up and ended up better. so i cannot give this place 5 stars although the food really deserves it. i will definitely be back  there when i am in vegas", 
            "my friend wanted to celebrate her tax return and take me to lunch (hooray for me!!) she wanted to have sushi on the strip, well mostly all the sushi restaurants on the strip don't open until dinner, except sushisamba, so that's where we landed.  while we waited for them to open, i was scoping yelp reviews to see what we should order. the <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark> seemed to be the #1 suggestion, so that's what we started out with.  neither  one of us were impressed, sorry to say, but i felt like i was eating just a giant piece of corn kernal. but it was all uphill from there. \n\nour server, drago, was very attentive and full of suggestions, he had asked if we dined here before and i told him i had been to the one in miami, then he said he would bring us something on the house for coming back. when i tell you, you must order these, i'm not exaggerating, they were excellent, not on the menu, <mark>Broiled Peruvian Bay Scallop</mark>, prepared differently than the one on the menu. they were so good we had to order another round. i am a huge fan of yellowtail, so we ordered the yellowtail taquitos, so tasty, i loved the crunch that the mini taco shell added to the yellowtail flavor. next up was a table favorite as well, <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> miso, it melted in your mouth.  i was skeptical at first, they are served on a skewer, so i wasn't expecting the amazing flavor i tasted when i took my first bite. drago suggested the <mark>El Topo</mark> roll, both of us like hot,, super spicy food, this roll had a nice kick at the end, i normaily don't like any kind of dairy on my sushi rolls, i.e. cream cheese, etc....but this had melted mozzarella, it was excellent. then came the grand finale, my friend is a huge kobe beef fan so she wanted to try the <mark>Seared W<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> Beef</mark>, excellent <mark>Grade A5</mark>5, ishi yaki hot stone, dipping sauces, vegetables. presentation was so nice, lots of different sauces to try.  dessert, yes we still had room for dessert, we tried the peruvian hot chocolate con cr\\u00e8me served with <mark><mark>Osetra Caviar Imperial 20g</mark> 20g</mark> and the coco duo dark and white chocolate custard with praline. the second one was by far the best. a must. also try the house made iced tea, they mix fresh orange juice, lime juice and lemon with black tea.....think i drank a pitcher of it.  good food, service, ambiance!", 
            "sushi samba is an amazing restaurant! from the ambiance, to guest service and delectable food.  we were waiting for a few friends to arrive and decided to wait at the bar and i must say the strawberry mojito's are to die for!  it was so light and refreshing. best mojito i have ever had!  because we were visiting from out of town we just wanted to dive in and experience what sushi samba had to offer.  we told our waiter we would eat whatever the chef wanted to prepare.  we had the beef and <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> anticuchos.  the beef was tender and succulent.  the <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> was moist and flaky.  it was served on small wooden sticks and the right portion size so it made it very easy to eat.  we also had seared <mark>Scallop</mark> on cold somen noodles along with seared scallop tobanyaki cooked in a clay pot with with crispy spinach.  the <mark>Scallop</mark> were very big in size and cooked to perfection!  the clay pot dish was savory and hearty all in one, definitely a must order!  to top off the experience chef rob juan came out and greeted us and told us a little bit about each dish that we had.  overall great service and amazing food!  i will be visiting this restaurant again the next time i'm back in las vegas.", 
            "i flipping love sushisamba. i've been here 3 times and it's just been incredible. this most recent trip, we were a group of 9 girls for a bachelorette party. we had lucked out by getting reservations the day of and they didn't make us wait. i thought they seated us in a weird spot...but no, our reservations were just so early, the place wasn't that full, but the table ended up being fine.\n\nwe decided to do the omakase style for around $50/person. they brought out the cocktail tree with 9 glasses of the samba juice which was incredible and such a great way for them to start wooing us, haha. \n- first course: fried green beans with truffle aioli (my fave!), grilled jalepenos (big hit!), and edamame.\n- second course: fish tacquitos (loved the shell, very crispy), a mushroom tacquito & large salad for the vegetarian, and pork pot stickers (good not great). \n- third course: the famed chilean <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> skewers (melt.in.your.mouth), <mark>Scallop</mark> with like a chimichurri sauce (delicious), and the <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark> (so <mark>Uni</mark>). \n- fourth course: meat/mushroom coconut milk \"curry\" (i hate coconut milk, and this was the one dish that we didn't make a considerable dent in...and they don't serve rice with this! weird).\n- fifth course: sushi. there were 3 different fish sushi rolls (salmon, tuna, and something else) and then 3 vegetarian (avocado, cucumber, and sweet potato--sweet potato was my fave!). they then brought out the dessert for my friend, which was comp'd which was nice.\n\nin my opinion, i felt like the chef prepared way too many fish dishes for this particular group because we had a vegetarian, we had someone who was allergic to shellfish, and we had 3 people who didn't like fish...and yet, we got a lot of fish. i think a lot of people go to sushisamba and expect sushi...but it's fushion, it's not <mark><mark>Osetra Caviar Imperial 20g</mark> 20g</mark>. i would definitely recommend doing the omakase style to start out--you can do it for $30-$75 per person and it's really fun. i rate it 4 stars because i think they should be more creative for vegetarians--vegetarians eat more than mushrooms :) but the service is great and the food is amazing. definitely one of my most consistent favorite places in vegas.", 
            "this place gets packed & reservations are strictly a must, on the weekends (especially holidays).\n\n5-stars for excellent service!!!  we were there last friday w/out a reservation, so the guy behind me cut right in-front of us & the host escorted him to his table (he turned around & laughed in our faces).  this is a 50+yr old man acting like a 5yr old.  in our 30's & 40's...we were way too mature to say anything back.  a really nice asian lady-host (very attractive) approached me & offered to do her best to slide us in if any of the tables became available.  five-minutes later i get a call to come-back quickly because she found a way to squeeze all six of us in.  ironically it was next to the 5yr old mentality man...lol!!!\n\nanother 5-stars for the menu!!!  i love asian-fusion cuisine & this place has a pretty large menu.  we were a moderate size group, so we tried almost everything on the menu.\n\nour consensus on likes are as follows:\nsawagani\n<mark>Green Bean Tempura</mark>\n<mark>Seaweed Salad</mark>\ntiger <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark>\nyellowtail seviche\n<mark><mark>Jumbo Shrimp</mark></mark> seviche\n<mark>Broiled Peruvian Bay Scallop</mark> (robata)\nanticuchos\nmiso-marinated chilean <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>\nsamba rolls (pacific)\nsamba rolls (<mark>Rainbow Dragon</mark>)\nsamba split for two (dessert)\nmochi (dessert)\nhousemade ice cream & sorvete (dessert)\npisco sour (cocktails)\nchicha sour (cocktails)\nsamba juice (cocktails)\n\nthe general manager (partner) came out to greet us, which was quite interesting.  our tummies were full & our faces were happy.  definitely coming back!!!",

            "to start off i was not expecting to be blown away with this place but i was!! everything from this restaurant was beyond my expectations.\nwent there for a special treat and oh my... we had one.\n\nfirst off i would not say the sushi is extraordinary, in fact its standard but i did love the yellow tail scallion there more than i do at most places, but the items on the menu other than sushi is what got me!\n\nfirst and for most  the drink tower is amazing and <mark>Uni</mark> from the appearance to all the different varieties like the cucumber one, strawberry, grapefruit, and so on...we tried total of 6!!. my favorite was the one with the cucumber and the one with the mint cant recall the actual names due to all the drinks ; ) \n\nnow on to the mealsssss the ones i loved would have to be the steak tacos, best i had in a really long time and the sauce that they come with has a little kick that makes it all so complete. another one would have to be the <mark><mark>Alaskan King Crab</mark> Leg</mark> cut in perfect portions to be grabbed with the chop sticks and topped off with a cream sauce was sooooooooo good!! there was also the miso <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> if you like the taste of the miso flavor and appreciate <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> like i do its a must, even though my last bite on the skewer was not as great as the first 3 ; ( and my favorite dish of the whole night would have to be the in shell <mark>Scallop</mark>!!!! i had never seem my <mark>Scallop</mark> served in a shell till i went to this place, they were cooked with perfection and had some sort of pesto butter topping them off. i can literally eat so many and never have enough!! \none more dish worth mentioning would have to be the tempura shrimp even though i am not a fan of most fried foods this one was good!! and the portion was giant!\n\nas far as the dessert i am usually one to clear out all the plates but this was not the case for me, we got the mochi variety dish but it was too frozen it didn't do the mochi justice, and our other dessert consisted of friend bananas (which i am not a fan of) and coconut cream and the best coffee ice cream i have ever had! this meal was a fun teat and experience and the staff was amazing! \n\nanother tip on the side is make reservations, it was packed when we got there...", 
            "first of all... amazing!  if you're okay with tapas style, paying a little more for a good meal, and willing to have fusion-y food... this place rocks!  the non-sushi plates are all worth trying... but our favorites were: japanese a5 <mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark>, yellowtail taquitos, the <mark>Broiled Peruvian Bay Scallop</mark> and the melt on you're mouth <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>! \n\nyes... this is a pricey joint, so maybe try the dishes that seem safe to you first, but everything we tried was simply amazing...that said, the sushi itself may not be anything too special, but the fusion items are totally worth every cent! \n\nmy suggestion: check out the menu beforehand so you have an idea of what to start with... as with all fusion foods, the descriptions are essential :)  \n\nof note: all the staff was helpful and friendly and intent on service...if you're lucky enough to get isabella... trust her!  her suggestions were all on point!", 
            "oh my goodness. i would have to say the dinner i had here was one of the best treats i've had this year! i am so for<mark>Tuna</mark> to have gotten this experience that i will never forget. it was so awesome! if coming here, i'd suggest making reservations because it is jam packed, but only because it is that good. the environment is bustling and vibrant. so. much. fun! \n\nwhen my friends showed up we got seated right away were introduced to the chef who told us he had many special dishes on their way. first off they presented us with a tower of drinks! all mini glasses of their specialty cocktails. so awesome! there were four of us and they brought us a total of 3 towers, so we each got to try 6 different flavors. loved it so much. the variety was just amazing. i'd have to say my top 3 favorites were the chu-cumber (cucumber flavored one), the lemon samurai, and pisco sour (i have visited peru before so i've had the opport<mark>Uni</mark> to try an authentic version of this before). so so great!\n\nall the meals brought out for us to share were fantastic! the <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark> was different a cool blend of flavors to add to our palette. the <mark><mark>Alaskan King Crab</mark> Leg</mark> were perfection! and my other favorite dishes were the mini tacos and the shelled <mark>Scallop</mark>. so amazing! other fantastic dishes i got to try were the <mark>Salt and Pepper Squid</mark>, <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark> (amazing), miso marinated <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>, <mark>Chicken Teriyaki-Samba Style</mark>... like i said. one. amazing. experience!!! i can't wait to come back again.", 
            "this is my favorite restaurant in las vegas. the chilean <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> 10/10 is the most scrumptious skewer of tender fish and it literally will melt in your mouth. \n\nthe <mark>Broiled Peruvian Bay Scallop</mark> garlic style (not on the menu ask for this!!!) are also not to be missed.\n\nexcellent sake selection, and they will also reheat your bottle for you if it gets lukewarm.\n\nthe yamato roll 10/10. served with <mark>Foie Gras</mark> - i just wish there were more than 3 dang guess i gotta order seconds.", 
            "the food was amazing, as was the service. my mom and i went and basically just relied on recommendations from our server, homer. he recommended the most delicious cocktails and dishes. he even surprised us with one dish simply based on the preferences we mentioned and it was incredible. it was <mark>Scallop</mark> with a sweet/teriyaki-like glaze and <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark> on the side. highly recommend. \n\nwe also had the cucumber cocktail, lychee bubbletail, and lychee martini. all amazing. we ordered the special roll for the night which was phenomenal. additionally, we got the taquitos (more like tacos with a hard shell) with the yellowtail, absolutely delicious. i doubt you can go wrong here. \n\nunfor<mark>Tuna</mark> for all of you, that was homer's last night. huge loss to sushisamba, i must say.", 
            "my favorite restaurant in vegas. i go here whenever i'm in town. i always leave it up to the server/ chef when i order so i've tried a little bit of everything and have never been disappointed. on my most recent visit i really enjoyed the skewers & the <mark>Scallop</mark>. you really can't go wrong here.", 
            "christine is amazing sever, manger very nice provided complimentary <mark>Scallop</mark> and food beyond amazing!  lobster samba rolls, tempura vegetables, red miso mushroom soup, shashito peppers, cucumber martinis and samba split are amazing!", 
            "my girlfriend and i stayed at the venetian and came here after watching cirque du soliel: zarkana at aria on 05-11-14. i found this restaurant on yelp before we came. i absolutely love sushi and she hates it. we both love texas de brazil so i figured a good compromise would be a churrascaria crossed with a sushi bar so we picked sushi samba. i always like to find the most expensive roll at sushi bars and try it so i picked the s\\u00c3o paulo for $24. it had <mark>Scallop</mark>, masago, red onion, tuna, salmon, shrimp, yellowtail, avocado, truffle, hacho miso soy, chive oil inside. to be honest the red onion over powered the flavor of every other ingredient and kind of ruined it for me. this is coming from someone that loves onions too. if i come back i'll probably ask them to cut that out when i order. i also ordered a generic <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> roll. for our two sharable sides we ordered <mark>Purple Potato Mash</mark> and <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark>. the two sides were the best thing at this restaurant. the <mark>Purple Potato Mash</mark> had a rich buttery taste and creamy texture that melted in my mouth. the <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark> had a perfect amount of sweetness and the texture was lightly firm just the way i like. the real downside of the meal though is that my girlfriend decided to order the <mark>Berkshire Pork Belly</mark> rather than the <mark>Lamb Chop</mark> she was thinking about. i asked if she was sure she wanted that and she said yes. i neglected to mention to her that <mark>Berkshire Pork Belly</mark> is literally a seared section of fat. she was not pleased, but didn't want to order anything else when her food arrived. my girlfriend was actually quite content with the <mark>Purple Potato Mash</mark> and <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark>. overall the experience was pretty good except for the group of 3 drunk russian speaking call girls (assuming) seated next to us that were intent on yelling over the music the entire time they were there instead of leaning in to hear one another. but, hey if you aren't hearing a drunk person screaming in another language next to you at most of the places you're at then you aren't experiencing vegas the right way. ha!", 
            "everytime i stay at the palazzo, i must eat at sushi samba.  although it's definitely on the pricier side, it's really worth the money.  and hey, you're in vegas, and you can't be cheap in vegas.  when ordering, you have two options: order off the preset menu or let the chefs create a sampling for you at the price you want.  because this restaurant is a fusion of mainly japanese and brazilian, they have many different chefs creating many different things.  although i tried both, i prefer choosing from the preset menu. this way i don't get something i don't particularly enjoy.  \n\nout of what i've tried so far, my favorites are the s\\u00e3o paulo roll, the <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> antichucho, and the garlic butter <mark>Scallop</mark>.  the s\\u00e3o paulo roll is a wonderful combination of <mark>Scallop</mark>, tuna, salmon, yellowtail, shrimp, red onion, masago, avocado, truffle (!!!), and chive oil.  the <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> has a miso glaze and comes with <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark>.  the <mark>Scallop</mark> are a bit more special because they aren't on the menu.  but they're basically their <mark>Broiled Peruvian Bay Scallop</mark> on a half shell, smothered in this delicious garlicky butter reduction.  can't wait to come back and try some other things on the menu!", 
            "this place is one in a million! from start to finish the service is excellent! the food was to die for! it was my second time back and my husbands first time! the restaurant manager allen holmes brought us out a welcome back dish, they were these amazing seasoned and cooked <mark>Scallop</mark>! to die for! our waitress stacey was a doll!  i will absolutely be back every time i'm in vegas!!!", 
            "i'm giving 5 stars because the sushi was fantastic, and the dishes were creative and inspired. love the brazilian fusion. tried two kinds of sashimi ceviche, both delicious. <mark>Scallop</mark> were amazing. had some salmon and yellowtail sashimi that was fresh and perfect. and, a special take on a <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> roll that was unbelievable. the service was fine. not thrilling, but perfectly serviceable.", 
            "we came to sushisamba for my birthday dinner a few days ago and i was blown away by the food! it definitely exceeded expectations.\n\nthe menu was so overwhelming we didn't know where to even begin and while our waiter didn't really help us narrow things down, he did make some good suggestions and helped us pace out the meal so we can order as we go. he came with the manager, who was very nice and gave us birthday shots, and also asked that we let him know if he could do anything. \n\nhere's what we started with: shishito peppers combo (grilled shishito peppers, tempura string beans with a truffle aioli, and edamame), <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark> in a spicy mayo sauce, <mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark>, and <mark>Crispy Hokkaido Scallop</mark> lettuce wraps. the peppers were a good surprise of the night because i didn't expect it to come with the string beans and edamame, but i definitely appreciated the greens in vegas! the <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark> was really tasty, but i wish it was a little crunchier when it came out. they tasted a bit soggy as if they were sitting in sauce for too long, but no complaints because the flavor was still there. the <mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> was good, but nothing really mind-blowing in my opinion. the <mark>Crispy Hokkaido Scallop</mark> lettuce wrap was phenomenal. our waiter said it was a new item on the menu and suggested we try it and it really blew us all out of the water. \n\nwe followed up the first round with the robata - we got the <mark>Berkshire Pork Belly</mark>, rib eye, <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>, and duck. all of them were so good, so make sure you pay a visit to the robata section when you visit! the duck and the rib eye to me stood out more than the others - they were cooked very well and had a good mix of <mark>Uni</mark> flavors.\n\nwe finished off dessert with their 4th of july special (red velvet cheesecake, frozen blueberries, and white chocolate ice cream) and sadly we were underwhelmed with what came out. i think we were so blown away by the entire meal, we felt like dessert was going to continue the streak, but were left wanting a bit more. either way, we were so stuffed it didn't matter and the dessert didn't take away from how much we liked the meal itself.\n\nwhat really set this over the edge is that the chef came out to shake our hands and chat with us really quickly, which i really appreciated! the service was great, the recommendations were on par, and the food was delicious. i would definitely recommend this spot for a special occasion - go ahead and gorge!!", 
            "sit at the bar with megan - she will point you in the right direction.   order the chile roasted edamame, the <mark>Crispy Hokkaido Scallop</mark>, and the kunamato oysters!! amazing :)", 
            "i always enjoy sushi samba.  it's a great mix of brazilian and japanese.  some concepts work better than others but even the basic stuff is done right.  salmon sushi - that's how i know if a place does sushi well - is great here.  i also loved some of the creative dishes - the yellowtail sashimi with jalapeno and lemongrass was wonderful.   but the killer dish to get - the <mark>Moqueca Mista</mark>!  shrimp, <mark>Scallop</mark>, mussels in a coconut broth with chimichurri rice!!!  heaven!\n\nonly real issue are their prices.  if you are prepared for the prices, it's worth a trip.", 
            "i give <mark>Crispy Hokkaido Scallop</mark> 5 stars, rainbow hexagon roll 4.5 stars and 5stars for the sashimi. but we waited for the <mark>Berkshire Pork Belly</mark> ramen for at least 30 mins. while we were still eating the waitress placed our bill on our table. so rude!! stone <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark> tastes weird and is not the regular fluffy crispy tempura i've seen before. pricey. ewwwwwwwww i gave them a minimum of 15%tip. i wish i could give them 0 dollars tip.", 
            "this restaurant came highly recommended by a friend who said this is a must go in vegas. my own experience was that the food was good but not the very best as i thought it would be. we ordered the <mark>Scallop</mark>, the duck, the oysters, the teriyaki chicken, <mark>Coconut Rice</mark> and the beef dumplings. the dumplings was my favorite. others in the party liked the <mark>Scallop</mark> and the oysters too. maybe we should have tried the <mark>Seared W<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> Beef</mark>, but were too tired and hungry to try cook it on the table.", 
            "it is with great sadness i give sushi samba two stars; one star is for new york and one for miami.  las vegas samba was a big fail. i must preface we came for a lunch which went swimmingly, the complimentary <mark>Broiled Peruvian Bay Scallop</mark> were the caliber of the best french restaurants of paris.  great service great experience.  hence our decision to come for dinner.  making a dinner reservation is useless, you wait an hour any way.  only to be greeted by a snotty receptionist making arrogant comments about having to wait.  to add insult to injury, the waiters are over worked and under trained.  placing an empty water glass and not filling it for 15 minutes and not brining sake that was ordered  upon seating another fail.  always bring the alcohol.  people will overlook almost anything if they are drinking.  i spoke to the manager and i recommended giving the receptionist the \"how to win friends and influence people\" training since she lacks any skill in that area.  the waiter needs training as well.  i will not hold it against new york or miami.  they rock.", 
            "what a way to celebrate my 21st birthday. after this experience i can only hope to have the opport<mark>Uni</mark> to come back year after year to celebrate just as perfectly.\n\nnot only was the food and drink world-class, the service and attention was deserving of 5 stars alone and both the servers and manager truly made this a special and memorable meal and experience.\n\nwe had 6:30 reservations but we arrived and were seated about 15 minutes early no questions asked and the night took off from there. \n\ni started the night with a brisa caliente cocktail: a conservatively spicy blend of tequila, ginger, fruit juices and chili in a rimmed glass with a shimchimi, a deliciously spicy japanese chili. although only a few days into the legal realm, i think i'll have a favorite drink for a long time coming.\n\nmy father and i split a number of dishes, including:\nspicy tempura rock shrimp: incredible array of flavors and textures. i've had similar dishes from local japanese fusion places and nobu and sushisamba's by far surpassed the competition. priced a little less with a more substantial portion, i could have been okay ordering a few of these.\n\nyellowtail and w<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> \"taquitos\": taquitos in the sense these two-a-piece small dishes were served in a mini crispy wonton-taco, the spicy aji panca sauce was drinkable by itself but added a level of sophistication that totally elevated the dish. i prefered the yellowtail over the w<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> mainly as the flavor of the fish was able to shine more than the beef. that said the beef was still really, really good.\n\n<mark>Broiled Peruvian Bay Scallop</mark>: served on the shell, these reminded me of a \"<mark>Scallop</mark> rockefeller\" of sorts, and the lime-butter crust was crispy and buttery. i'm glad they were <mark>Broiled Peruvian Bay Scallop</mark> versus their larger, more flavorful cousin since the crust was overpowering but as a single bite it was great.\n\nmiso chilean <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>: my favorite of the night, the two-skewer dish is completely melt-in-your-mouth with a perfect salty-sweet sauce. definitely the best non-<mark><mark>Osetra Caviar Imperial 20g</mark> 20g</mark> i've ever had. may be a little pricey but the flavor is just really, really good. this came with the <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark> which is now my all-time favorite vegetable...large kernels with a crazy good flavor.\n\n<mark>Sao Paulo</mark> samba roll: we were tempted by the gluttony of this everything-but-the-kitchen-sink roll and it was pretty awesome. it was a little much in the sense it's hard to differentiate everything inside, but the sauce on the side added an indescribable flavor that made it special. the roll comes with scallop, masago, red onion, tuna, salmon, shrimp, yellowtail, avocado, truffle, hacho miso soy, chive oil. wow.\n\n\"chef's inspiration\" sashimi platter: i'm a sucker for really good fish. that means i can be pretty picky, too. the platter came with 9 pieces, 3 each of sake salmon, akami tuna and yellowtail tuna. salmon included, the fish were so fatty (in the good way) and melt-on-the-toungue my father and i both were just blown away by the quality of raw fish from a restaurant which fuses japanese, brazilian and peruvian alike. \n\nraspberry sorbet w/ green tea coating: not sure what we were getting ourselves into with this, but the sweet white chocolate (?) and green tea ganache/candy-like coating paired with the super smooth and perfectly-sweet sorbet was the perfect end...and i don't generally choose fruit desserts.\n\n--\nall in all, i really cannot find any flaw in this place. i could only guess fewer-star ratings are attributed to a bad day or something because sushisamba has easily entered its way into my top 5 restaurants of all time...not an easy task. again i experienced wonderfully attentive service, great food, amazing cocktails and ended the night full and happy. not much more i could have asked for. thanks for an awesome birthday!",

            "took my girlfriend in this past weekend. \n\ndecor: very nice, sleek & modern with twists. \n\nservice:  very good, very attentive in a busy environment, my water was filled the whole time, the dishes were picked up as soon as we were finished. everything was on time. \n\nthe food: i thought the food was pretty average, nothing really to write home about. i had the <mark>Broiled Peruvian Bay Scallop</mark>....average. tuna with yellowtail, average. a roll i can't really remember what it was, that's how average it was. i honestly expected much more. 3 stars for the ambiance, decor, service & plating.", 
            "not the best sushi... get the <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> with <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark>! skip the <mark>Scallop</mark>... we wont be back... but ok to try  once... just dont plan on being impressed!", 
            "sushi samba was great! overall everything was delicious! but one concern would be the portion sizes in comparison with the prices.\nfirst, we had the <mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> and they were delicious! very juicy and great sauce. they were pretty small though. \nthen we had the sashimi that came with 9 pieces: yellowtail, tuna, and salmon. the fish was not as fresh as i would like, but my brother and sister liked it. \nthe last thing was the grilled <mark>Scallop</mark> with <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark>. the corn was the best part. the <mark>Scallop</mark> were coated with a very sweet sauce. \nour waiter nick was a very handsome man with a beautiful smile! the servers were all professional and good looking! the service was great and very welcoming! i would definitely come back!!", 
            "amazing food and service! we went here for dinner and then went back for lunch the next day. they thanked us for coming back by giving us some delicious <mark>Scallop</mark>. i highly recommend the <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>. it was cooked to perfection and very tasty. with every dish we ordered, we practically licked the plates clean.", 
            "best restaurant ever!!!! innovative.... <mark>Uni</mark>.... and full of flavor!!! my date and i order several of the sashimi options with different sauces... wow!!! but as a gift from the chef was this incredible oysters on the half.... never did i eat something so amazing..... it seamed to have some kind of pesto on it that was to die for!!! we also were recommended the special <mark>Scallop</mark> of the night.... it had coconut cream on it and they were soooo good.... we then ordered the rib steak... although we ordered it medium rare it came out medium well, i still wouldn't complain.... it was sliced in a clay pot with the an amazing sweet sauce with mushrooms and truffles.... wow... usually dessert sounds better then it is, but this time was different... this was better by miles then what it sounded like!!! everyone must order the samba dulce banana dessert.... better then sex!!! i cannot wait to come back and try the tasting menu!!! our waiter was adorable and the service was immaculate!!! i cannot wait to come back....", 
            "i have eaten here a lot for dinner throughout the years. we were in search of a great lunch. we found it here at sushisamba. we had the perfect lunch to get us through a busy day in vegas. we had the seared w<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> small plate (always my favorite-i always order this), <mark>Coconut Rice</mark>, the <mark>Samba Strip</mark> roll and the yuzu tart cheesecake. everything was delicious and had great presentation. i loved that is was not loud and overcrowded at lunch. we had just the perfect lunch. the specialty drinks are a must. i can't remember the names, but one that had japanese whiskey in it with pineapple was absolutely delicious. i highly recommend it. the general manager, jeremy made our lunch extra special with a tasting of a new dish of cooked <mark>Scallop</mark> with a pesto sauce that was dynamite and the miso marinated <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> dish. everything was amazing and not heavy. the <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> to our surprise was our favorite dish, but there wasn't anything we tried that wasn't delicious. it was so moist and had so much flavor. i love this menu because it is diverse and there is something for everyone's specific taste buds and you can easily share if you'd like. my husband really enjoyed the experience here. thank you to jeremy for a great experience along with the wonderful wait staff. if you want a meal that is diverse in flavor and presentation and will leave you full, but not heavy and uncomfortable-this is the perfect place. you get the full package here with great service and delicious food. well worth it.", 
            "i celebrated my 25th birthday at sushi samba and it was incredible. we were able to catch happy hour at the bar before we were seated did the omakase. i would recommend doing so, the happy hour drinks were tasty and just $6! the omakase was incredible, we did a $60 tasting and received everything from nigiri, cod (my favorite), poke tacos, <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark>, <mark>Scallop</mark>, and a birthday treat. great environment, staff, and amazing food. you won't be disappointed!", 
            "like many things on the strip, sushisamba is an overpriced over the top version of something you could find off the strip. it's tough to rate restaurants on the strip merely because of the price tag but ignoring the inflation, i thought samba had a good vibe, fairly good/quick service, and a decent amount of tasty tapas/appetizers. ironically, i hated all their sushi (mushy, bland sushi rice is no bueno).\n\ni love the concept of samba, and stick with the appetizers and small plates. \n\nthings i liked\n- <mark>Mushroom Tobanyaki</mark>: half mushrooms, half butter. delicious.\n- <mark>Seared W<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> Beef</mark>: small but good.\n\npretty good:\n- <mark>Crispy Jidori Egg</mark>: mostly crispy stuff, not enough eggy goodness\n- <mark>Broiled Peruvian Bay Scallop</mark>: \n\ndo not get:\n- any of the sushi", 
            "yum!   best sushi place ever.  i prefer it even to nobu.  \n\nparticularly like the <mark>Broiled Peruvian Bay Scallop</mark> and <mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> starters! \n\nservice is, as always, fantastic.  \n\nthe restaurant has a great atmosphere. interesting decor. high quality food.", 
            "had lunch here and it was delicious. had the <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>(awesome), and two sushi rolls (both delicious). also, there was some mixup and the table next to us ended getting some of our stuff, they gave us one of our dishes for free, brought out another dish (<mark>Scallop</mark>) on the house and gave us dessert as well. great place, great food, great service, we'll definitely be back!"

            "talk about a hidden gem. this place is nestled deep within the palazzo shops, but don't let that stop you from going as it is definitely worth the trek. on our recent visit here, we had a variety of sushi and grilled items and everything was excellent. some highlights: \n\nshishito - nicely charred, spicy, drizzled with oil and sea salt. very good. best shishito i've had.\n<mark>Organic Chicken</mark> - a little heavy with the sauce but still a good eat.\n<mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> - yum! both the chicken and the <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> were served on a bed of <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark>, which was very tasty. \n<mark>Rainbow Dragon</mark> roll - nicely crafted roll of fresh eel and avocado with just the right amount of sauce.\nkanpachi - delicious with lots of wasabi.\n\nfor drinks i had the caipirinha--a brazilian concoction--which was not only excellent but also a steal at only $10.\n\ni would deduct a star as our staff failed to mentioned certain items were out of stock after we had ordered them, but i realize this place is very new and they're still getting their act together. i'll definitely come back again.\n\n(my rating scale:\n5-outstanding, sets the standard for others. 4-very good, would bring friends/family here. 3-decent but wouldn't recommend to others. 2-disappointing. 1-a waste of everyones' time.)", 
            "alright, now were getting to the good stuff. \n\nand by \"good\" i mean un-fucking-believable. yea, i said it. unreal. never have i wanted to pick up and move to vegas so much in all of my life, but i'm thinking about it after the dinner i had at sushisamba's new ultra lounge, sugarcane. this is an incredible statement for me because for one, i can only take vegas in small doses, and two, i despise the heat. so having said that you can believe me when i say that i love absolutely everything about sushisamba, the brazilian/peruvian/japanese fusion restaurant at the palazzo. \n\nwhere do i begin?\n\noh yes, holy mary mother of god, i've died and gone to heaven...\n\na friend of mine is the publicist for this new restaurant, as well as the brand spanking new, sugarcane. she hooked up a dinner reservation for me and some friends so that we could celebrate my good friend's birthday in style. upon our (late) arrival we were greeted warmly by the wait staff, as they explained to us that our party would be the very first members of the public to sit down to dinner in their brand new ultra lounge. as we walked through the dimly lit hallway, past the dj booth and dance floor, and into the dining area portion of sugarcane we were immediately taken back by the overall design concept of the space. i\"m gonna do my best to do it justice but i would highly recommend a trip here to experience for yourself because it is just too complex for words...\n\nthe walls are covered with graffiti-style murals of samurais and japanese script, the dance floor has a canvas like screen that wraps around the circular pods that make up the women's bathrooms (see pics) where they project abstract imagery to coincide with the music playing. the dj that night was claudio who i wanted to put in my pocket and take home because the music was just that dope. there are multi-colored glass cylinders that hang from the ceiling and beams of light (see pics) that separate the dance floor from the dining area that change from red to orange to white that create a truly magnificent effect. \n\nthe food and service is on a level that is even harder to explain - it was incredible. our waiter anthony took such good care of us we felt as though we were old friends by the time we left. of course, we were the first to be seated and the last to leave, so i guess if you spend enough time with your waiter (four hours) you begin to feel like family. our sake sommelier was a hilariously funny girl (i forgot her name) and very helpful and knowledgeable when describing our sake selections. we ended up choosing a bottle with gold leaf cherry blossoms there were supposedly good luck if you found them floating in your drink. \n\nour table decided to order the signature sushisamba 7-course omakase ($70 per person) as our dinner selection. anthony asked us if we had any food allergies or other special requests before going back to the kitchen to get our party started. our first course was a selection of appetizers (see pics) which included the kobe beef carpaccio with <mark>Mixed <mark>Wild Mushrooms</mark></mark>, seared ahi tuna on a tiny bed of spinach, and (my favorite) tiny ceviche fish tacos with a chili foam sauce that was amazing! next up was the best snow crab i have ever tasted, <mark>Filet Mignon</mark>, duck, chilan <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> (unreal), grilled tomatoes, fish jowel (i forget what kind) and the most beautiful sashimi plate i've ever seen/tasted. just when we thought we couldn't eat any more came the sushi course. a stand out roll was the kobe beef wrapped roll with (from what i can remember) a <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark>, cucumber and avocado center. as we sat back in our booth contemplating exactly how we were planning on walking out of there, anthony presented the birthday girl with an incredible chocolate fondue plate (see pics) complete with japanese-style sesame rice krispies, japanese cake, homemade marshmallows, and a selection of fruit. there were also mini fruit tacos with both mango and banana, with a chocolate mousse and caram<mark>El Topo</mark>. \n\ndo you see what i'm talking about?????\n\nhere's the rundown....\n\nparty <mark><mark>Assortment of Four</mark></mark>:\nfirst round of cocktails (on the house)\nseveral cocktails to follow\nbottle of premium sake\n7- course omakase dinner for four ($70 each)\nafter dinner cocktails\ndivine dessert platter\n\ntotal bill: approx $600\n\nnot bad i'd say. not bad at all. \n\nall in all, i plan to go back to visit several times over. anyone who stumbles upon this place should consider themselves lucky to be in the presence of such foodie excellence. this dinner made our entire trip, and made for a very, very happy birthday girl. \n\nsushisamba: the wait staff, the owner, the managers, the dj. you rock my rock-n-roll world.", 
            "i fell in love with sushi samba a few years back in new york, so i had to check out the lv location. this time around it was just as good, if not better. i love the lively ambiance, and the service is wonderful. we decided to get the omakase, and my favorite had to be the chilean <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> served with <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark>.  sooooo good.  another favorite was the yellowtail taquitos. they're small but very delicious. the oysters and <mark><mark>Alaskan King Crab</mark> Leg</mark> were extremely fresh, and we also had a plate of sashimi in various sauces. the sauces were all citrusy (i.e. yuzu) and weren't for my taste but good nonetheless. \none drawback: too full for dessert.", 
            "on a hot vegas weekend stay, my bf and i limited our dining choices to the venetian and palazzo (conveniently connected).  we stopped in for lunch without reservations or doing any prior research, except for the two minutes at the entrance perusing the menu.  they had only been open three weeks, so the staff seemed very eager to bring in any and all people.  our server was extremely friendly, trying her best to make us comfortable and answer any questions.  i think she was asian, but she said she grew up in somewhere in south america, and had an indiscernible accent.  she made everything on the menu sound tasty, but we were only looking for a light lunch.  i had the samba blt which was had yummy chunks of lobster, a bit of mayo heat and applewood smoked bacon.  it came with a side of fingerling potatoes with a sprinkling of some kind of cheese on top, which is called \"fries\" on the menu.  the pickles, i did not like - too tart.  i tried everything on my bf's anticuchos combination bento.  the box usually comes with chicken, beef and shrimp, but he requested the shrimp be switched out for the miso <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>.  its sweetness is best taken in small quantities, such as one skewer.  i liked it, but it is probably too sweet for some.  the tuna roll was acceptable.  it's incredibly dark inside, which makes the bright mall atmosphere outside all the more apparent.  i'd like to return for lunch, because i could envision this place being a too much like a noisy nightclub for dinner.", 
            "having been to their sister establishments; china grill co, i had high expectation for this place.  i am a huge fan of asian fusion anything.  i would give this place 5 except for the small tables we were sat at.\n\nthis place was extremely busy with your <mark><mark>Osetra Caviar Imperial 20g</mark> 20g</mark> down tempo music playing.  it has a huge projector screen displaying various images of sport or anime.  we made rsvp and got seated within 10 minutes.  \n\nhere we go, the host sat us right by the server isle between the entrance and the kitchen, not impress and not off to a good start.  after getting bumped several times i asked to be moved.  then they moved us to a table that was so close to another couple that we might as well been sharing the bill.  there was no room to move.  i told my girl to wash her hands first before sitting down because we have to pull the table out and asked the people on both side to excuse us.  so far, even worse start.  \n\nnow the food, we were told that the portions are small, so be prepared to order a lot and to damage the amex.  we asked for some recommendation from our server whom by the way was absolutely excellent and was there for everything we need.  he even apologized for the tomato can seating we were in.  we ordered the tuna taquitos which was <mark>Uni</mark> with taste and textured - 5.00 per pc.  we had the yellow tail carpaccio with yellow sauce - 18.00 for 5 pcs and worth every penny. i had the <mark>Filet Mignon</mark>,small and pricey but again worth it.  jennifer had the <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>, again soft and <mark>Uni</mark> flavors, we also had the <mark>Lamb Chop</mark> from the robata and it is the best <mark>Lamb Chop</mark> i had recently.  we also had a few rolls as well, small but delicious.  for desserts we had the donut holes dipped in melting chocolate.  again,the great taste!!!  \n\nthe service is impeccable, even with small tables, the drinks were <mark>Uni</mark> a bit soft, but the flavors were remarkable.  the portions are extremely small, but again, the taste are <mark>Uni</mark> - japanese with brazilian.  the table next to us were from europe (whom thought this place was as of value, i guest that what happens when you get a euro into a dollar; instant discount) recommend we try the sampler menu - 80.00 per person but 7 courses. the server did too.  the next time we will since we did spend over 200.00 there.  \n\nsushi samba is now my top 5 places to eat at, we can't wait to go back there in a few months.", 
            "this place is sooo good. they have a really nice atmosphere. my friend placed reservation here for my birthday. we got there perfect timing. the waitress and manager are so friendly. service is really good here. now the food, just great. we got the appetizer with salted bean, tempera bean, and grilled jalapeno. the beans taste good. the jalapeno wasn't spicy, but had a very sourish/\"pickle\" taste. it's different. we ordered a samba roll. that was really good. crunchy, tasteful, and delicious. we ordered the tiger shrimp and <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>. both came with <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark>. it was my first time having <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark>. it is good. it's chewy and reminds me of \"sticky\" corn but larger size. the <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> was very good. the meat was soft and sweet and melts in your mouth. it had a teriyaki flavor i thought. the <mark>Shrimp</mark> was very good too. both tasted very fresh, especially the shrimp. it smells like the ocean. we also ordered fried calamari. the calamari has a tangy sauce poured on top with mixture vegetable including good tomatoes and <mark>Sweet Plantain</mark>. they brought out warm banana chocolate cake for me. the dessert is delicious. ice cream and a crunchy chocolate piece on top of warm chocolate cake in syrup with couple strip of fried banana. just delicious. all the food were brought out in a very good presentation. the dishes are pricey. but if you want to eat fresh and good quality food, you should come to this place.", 
            "overpriced!!!!\n\nthis place is waaay overpriced. appetizer size plates for $20 with barely enough food on them to feed a fish. sushi was nothing to rave about....i have had much better at my local sushi joint. spent a lot of money for an empty stomach in the end. sure the place is beautiful with nice decor but would i really pay all that for that food. i think not! \n\n<mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> was the best dish i had...it almost melted in your mouth. i perhaps would return for this dish but at $20 for two kebabs....i would have to think about it. <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> was about the size of half your palm for $20...ridiculous if you ask me. some good flavor but too expensive for me to return. you definitely do not get what you pay for here.", 
            "excellent service from matt who was very knowledgeable of the foreign terms on the menu and made the atmosphere more lively.  he was very patient with the dietary restrictions that my friend had and made great recommendations.  \n\nhighlights were the <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark> which were colossal and meaty.  they disappeared very quickly.  we also shared the <mark>Rio Grande</mark> churrasco.  one of the 3 meats we had chosen were the rib eye which was medium rare and excellent with the red chimichurri dipping sauce (1 of the 4 sauces that came with the dish).  the lobster on the <mark>Samba Strip</mark> roll was the best thing of the dish - everything else was a bit plain and for $20, i don't think i'll be ordering that again. we also had the tasty <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> skewers and topped our dinner off with 3 flavors of ice cream on a plate with a chocolate 'happy birthday' written on it for the birthday girls. the place is a bit pricey but heck, we were in vegas!", 
            "i really liked this place just a couple of things ruined the experience for me. first of all we sat in this tiny tiny table and i could totally smell and almost taste what the couples next to me were eating/order.. i can't even begin to tell you how close we were.. ew.  and i was soo overwhelmed with the menu. but i guess that is a good thing. oh and i did not like the ceviche taco, too smushy for me.\n\nour waitress was amazing, all her suggestions (the <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> and the <mark>Berkshire Pork Belly</mark>) were our faves. \n\nwe also got the sashimi platter, over 14 pieces of sashimi and it filled me up! \n\nthey comped me a birthday cake which was delicious!  this is now on my vegas rotation!", 
            "sushi samba gets 5 big red stars in my book!\n\ndecor - i love the vibrant colors and pictures they had all over the walls. it reminded me of anime. \n\nservice - excellent! our waiter was very helpful and made many great suggestions. the food came quick as well even when the restaurant was full.\n\nfood - great presentation and absolutely flavorful! nom nom nom! i didn't want to get full so i could eat some more!\n\nordered:\n<mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> yakitori - this was our first dish to arrive and it definitely set the bar. the fish just melted off. it was cooked well and seasoned perfectly. the <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark> that came with it was good as well. very robust and large kernels. \n\nyellowtail ceviche - amazing! the lime juice and other flavors blended so well together. this was my favorite dish along with the <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> yakitori. \n\ntuna ceviche - the tuna was fresh tasting but wasn't as great as the yellowtail ceviche. maybe i got spoiled but i thought the <mark>Cherry Tomatoes</mark> and almonds over powered the fish, which too me isn't a good thing because i love raw fish. \n\nkanpachi sashimi - nice sliced of fresh kanpachi and jalepeno. wonderful dish. \n\n<mark>Neo Tokyo</mark> roll - it was good but not great. nothing much more to say about it. \n\n<mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark> - very crisp and fresh. lightly powdered shrimp. didn't have too much tempura and was not soggy like other places. \n\nsignature fruit cocktails - strong but also fruity (meaning i could tast the fresh fruit flavors). a good strong drink doesn't need to taste bad. \n\ni wold definitely go again and i am recommending sushi samba to all my friends and whoever else is planning on going to vegas. =d",

            "it would've been 5 stars but the waitress was bitchy at first!\n\nbeing a huge sex and the city fan, i had to go to this place.  the decor is captivating and the lighting is perfect.  red is the dominant hue of the restaurant and it is so pretty.   the location in ceasars is kind of hidden so we stumbled upon it.  we went at the perfect time, right around 3 or 4 and it was not busy.  however, the place got packed!  they decided to put a row of 6 or 7 tables extremely close together so you feel like you are having dinner with complete strangers on either side of you.  you can hear their entire conversation, by the way.  just entirely too intimate for me.  \n\nour visit started out kinda rocky.  our waitress lacked time management skills and/or waited on the other tables hand and foot because she thought they would give them a bigger tip, maybe? dont know!  all i do know is that we sat there for 25 minutes with nothing more than a hello.  so after compaining to another waitress she finally came around.  while we were ordering, our server was more than eager to answer all of my hyper active, anxious and indecisive friend.  \n\nthe menu is a combination of pervian, brazillian and asian fusion.  oooooh so divine!  it was so hard to decide on what to choose.  we finally decided on sushi and <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>, <mark>Miso Soup</mark> and <mark>Seaweed Salad</mark>.  the miso is delicious but i've had better.  my friend ordered the red wild mushroom and truffle miso.  it was sooooo delicious!  but, the <mark>Seaweed Salad</mark> is a must have to veggie lovers.  seaweed has a distinct taste of it's own but it is sooo friggin good!  i was so pleasantly surprised.  when to food arrived, i was like a kid in a candy store.  i cannot remember what sushi i ordered but one of them the best ever!  as expected, the food is expensive.   between the 2 of us, it was well over $100. so don't go here if you are trying to save money.  if you do just order the tapas on the left side of the menu.  but, you will still be hungry.\n\ni loved this place.  with the exception of the servers lack of time management skills at first, this was one of my favorite visits on this trip.  i will be going back!  i love sushi samba!!!!!!!", 
            "we stayed at the venetian and palazzo over the weekend. it took us about an hour to decide on which restaurant in the palazzo to dine at....because man are the restaurants super pricey. since we had friends that had to catch a flight we had to eat in the palazzo so we decided on this place for a group of 9.\n\nthis place blends japanese, brazilian, and peruvian cuisine....while it sounds like a great idea (never heard of such an asian fusion combo)....i think this place tries way to hard to be different. the only thing that i really liked was the grilled <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>....super yummy but it still was $16 for two mini skewers. it came with <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark> which sounded interesting....but turned out to be huge corn kettles that tasted like buttered lima beans....yucko!!! as far as the sushi i tried about 5 of the 10 rolls they had. wasn't too impressed with any of them. they looked pretty and all....but weren't so yummy. i tried a few other dishes too....it just seemed like they were blending <mark>Uni</mark> flavors that just didn't blend well together. the few things preventing me from giving this place 2 stars was the great service (note: they do get 20% tip for groups.....so i do expect top quality service), cool ambiance, and hot guys. check out the break down below:\n\n2 stars - food (overall disappointing)....except for the<mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> \n2 stars - price (expect to pay $40 - $100 per person if you want to get full)\n2 stars - portions (i left still a bit hungry)\n4 stars - atmosphere\n5 stars - service (really friendly waitress)\n5 stars - hot workers!!! (seriously...do you have to be a model to work here....there was lots of eye candy dressed in all black)\n__________________________________\n\njust 3 stars all in all....overall don't really recommend it here if you are strapped on cash....ur probably better off at a buffet on the strip if you wanna get your money's worth. but if you have money to blow....this is a happening place.", 
            "this first time i had sushi samba was in miami last year. i had no idea there were several restaurants throughout the us. i was in vegas last weekend and we decided to eat at sushi samba in the palazzo. the menu was significantly different than the lunch menu at the miami location. not only was it different, it was significantly better! i was not dissapointed with the chilean <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> that i had for dinner. it was marinated in miso and accompanied with veggies. superb and perfectly  cooked. we also started off with tempura and the unagi and copeira rolls. yummy!!!!  the salad we also ordered was a large portion...enough to feed all four of us.\n\ni was able to taste test all of my friends food as well and theirs seemed just as good as mine!!\n\nthis place is great for a nice dinner in vegas although a little pricey (spent over $220 total on food only, no cocktails) it is definitely worth it to try out of the ordinary and comfortably ordinary menu items. i am such a fan!", 
            "i went here with a bachelorette party of about 7 of us.  none of us had been here before and didn't know what to expect.  we made dinner reservations, but still had to wait a bit to get our table.  once we got in... the server was definitely hospitable, gracious, and informative - i only wished i remembered his name to give a shout out. he informed us of the type of restaurant sushi samba was, which is a fusion of japanese, brazilian and peruvian.  we all weren't sure of what to get so he suggested we do a \"tasty menu\" which i think was the omakase (on the website menu).  this allowed us to try the different types of food the menu had to offer.  we let him know what we liked and what we didn't like and he informed the chefs and they brought out a plethora of tasty treats that was enough for 7 of us.  it started off with some appetizers, such as the otsumani ( an assortment of edamame, tempura green beans and shishito  - spicy peppers.... absolutely delicious!) and an assortment of other appetizers that i can't remember.  we then had a n array of seviche.  after that we had different types of meats on skewers and then topped off the evening with sashimi and sushi rolls.  one thing, we were all in awe of the food , we could hardly remember what everything was.  a huge highlight of the dinner was the yellowtail seviche! an absolute delicious delight.  another overwhelming mouth watering treat was the chilean <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> on skewers with <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark>.  i believe we also had the <mark>Samba Strip</mark> roll at the end of the meal which was thoroughly mouth quenching!  we all sat back after the meal and were all very happy and pleased with this establishment and all said how we were going to have to come back there every vegas excursion we go on.  it is a bit pricey.. but i think the food is worth the $$$$.  on top of all that, the atmosphere was definitely pleasing as well as the music which kept me moving in my seat all night.  this place is well worth the 5 star rating and worth the $$$$!", 
            "foodie orgasms is all i can say about this establishment. i am friends with the managers at the southbeach location so when i went to go hang out with a friend in sin city i decided to pull rank and get some first class service knowing full well i was gonna lose money on the tables. \nyeah i lost money but wasnt disappointed one bit at the sushisamba location at the palazzo hotel. i will avoid mentioning having to drop a former friend from ruining my dinner right b4 it started but as soon as i got to the location which i must say is unbelievable and by far is the best designed sushisamba, a close second will be the now defunct location in dallas at the galleria mall. i felt like a kid when i entered the restrooms. i had a nice corner to myself and the hostess was kind enuff to keep me company since i got jilted by a former friend (which i refuse to talk about).  \ni got ala carte type service and even the chef, jose came out to greet me and making me feel special cos he remembered me from the southbeach spot. the taquitos were incredible i had the yellow tail and the lobster one. i decided i was only going to do small plates so i ventured to the anticuchos and ordered the chicken liver which just melted in my mouth and made vegas worthwhile and followed by the chilean <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> that the hostess recommended. for my drink i always get their caiprinha which is like a brazilian mojito and was on point.\n\nnow i was getting full but the chef surprised me with a kobe beef plate which was sushi <mark>Grade A5</mark> once again splendid and lest i forget i also ordered the <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark> for my side which is ridiculously tasty. \n\nthere were several groups in town for bachelors parties and partying in general and the decor just made the groups blend in and make it very private. \n\nwill definitely be back", 
            "i was in vegas last weekend, and rolled out of bed at 11am on saturday with a craving for sushi.  i recalled having had a tasty sushi meal in the venitian canal shops a few years back, so my wife and i headed over there looking for the place.  we ended up at sushi samba in the palazzo shops, which was not the place i remembered but certainly a pleasant experience.  i had always known that south america had a decent population of japanese people, but had never been anywhere that attempted a fusion of japanese and south american cuisine.  it totally works, and the restaurant was beautiful inside.\n\nthe sushi was excellent.  we tried the chef's selection which came with a nice assortment of tuna, salmon, yellowtail, and shrimp.  we also tried one of the south american dishes - miso <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> skewers with <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark>.  i had never had anything like it and it was amazing.  in the end the bill for those items plus a few more and a couple of beers came to just over $100, but well worth it.  \n\ni would highly recommend this place, and would also recommend you try it for lunch instead of dinner.  at midday there were only a handful of people there and the service was excellent.", 
            "i think the reason why i put off this review for 2 months is that i've been afraid of not praising this place enough with what i'm about to say in a couple of lines. first of all, thanks to my procrastination, i've forgotten the incredibly friendly manager's name who treated us newly legals to 3 chu-cumber shots, which, btw, go down ridiculously well. (maybe his name was anthony...?) anyway, he also hooked us up with a bouncer at tryst and we got in without having to wait! so the staff and their service is really really amazing. i'm pretty positive if you go there (soon), there will still be this omg-drool-with-my-eyes-like-it's-possible waiter there ready and waiting to fill up your glass of water... or take your order... or ravage - no, that's it. \n\nenough about the awesome service, the food was also really really amazing. it's a brazilian/japanese fusion type restaurant, but i'm not really big on brazilian unless it's like a churascaria, so we went with mainly japanese type dishes. (i mean \"japanese\" in the most non-<mark><mark>Osetra Caviar Imperial 20g</mark> 20g</mark> though) \n\nthe condensed version looks like this and in this order (but all should be had at least once - write it down guys, seriously. prepare yourselves):\nbobo brazil roll\ngreen envy roll\n<mark>El Topo</mark> roll\nmiso marinated chilean <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> (way too small for it's own good.) \n<mark>Neo Tokyo</mark> roll\n\nthis place is pretty pricey, but i've been here 3 times already and i don't intend to stop. i've pretty much made an agreement with myself that i will eat here at least once any time i'm in vegas. \n\n5 stars!! \n\nokay, and i know i mentioned \"condensed version\" earlier which implies a more in-depth explanation to those, but too bad? you're just going to have to trust me. \n\nhappy gambling, happy clubbing, happy eating, and happy samba-ing. :)", 
            "this place was really built by a couple of my friends that couldn't stop talking about it.  i thought it was ok and overpriced, even for vegas standards. there were some great items--<mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> anticuchos and <mark>Berkshire Pork Belly</mark> ramen were my favs of the evening.  the sushi was decent but nothing out of the ordinary for the price.  the mini tacos were good, but just that, mini.  the <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark> was a bust at our table--way too much mayo and 2/3 of the <mark>Seaweed Salad</mark> tasted like nothing.  it prob would have fared better if my expectations weren't so high.", 
            "out of all the restaurants i've been to in vegas, i must say....sushi samba is probably the best one i've eaten at!  \n\nthough the food isn't cheap and the portions aren't big.....everything that i ordered was delicious and well worth the money.  i would recommend everything i ordered for those that are going there.  \nhere's what i ordered for 2 people:\n1) <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> and miso antichucos....the <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark> that comes with it was quite tasty\n2) <mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark>....3 fried tofu, 1 asparagus and 1 mushroom in some sort of sauce.  this was probably the most normal item that we ate on the menu....but it was still good.\n3) bobo brazil samba roll.  this was quite interesting...seared kobe beef roll.\n4)  some sort of <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> roll.  the tuna was high quality...very fresh!\n5) peruvian hot chocolate....this was damn good!  the drink was thick and very creamy.\n6) mango honey crisp taquito.  \n\nthinking of the food makes me drool wishing i could have it again.  \nthe service there was excellent!  waiters clean your table and fill your water before you even have to ask.  they were very attentive and not smothering.\n\nbe aware though...right when you sit down they ask you if you'd like some edamame.  you think this would be free....but you will later find out that you're being charged for it.  \n\nsushi samba is a definite must!", 
            "i'm not a sushi purist, i love the fusion crap :)  i would give them 4 stars but they ran out of <mark>Alaskan King Crab</mark>.  how do you run out of something that makes up the base for many different items/rolls u serve.  we ordered something called the yamato roll which was pretty good except for the fact that it was $19 for 3 pieces.  it was the only roll that didn't have the standard 5-6 pieces.  for that much money i was expecting much more pop.  i love anything with <mark>Foie Gras</mark> so i may have liked the yamato roll more than i should've.  however, if you don't like <mark>Foie Gras</mark> skip it and get something else.  the miso <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> was fantastic just like the waiter described.  what bothers me is that they keep telling you how little the portions are after u order the dish which makes u order it twice or more  if you're with two plus people.  the miso <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> was like $16 for one skewer.  the food is good but be warned if you want to leave full you will spend a lot of money.  good thing it was comped thanks to my buddy.\n\nps  the chef's sushi/sashime does not come with straight sashime.  it was one sushi roll with some nigiri.",

            "every year i go to miami for winter music conference i have been lured to go eat at sushi samba over on lincoln but i have never had the chance to eat there. not sure why. maybe it always seemed to packed and i didn't want to wait. i know now that i missed out on some damn good meals.\n\nright before thanksgiving my wife and my father in law traveled over to las vegas for a few nights. as we walked into the venetian hotel i saw a billboard for sushi samba at the adjoining hotel, the palazzo and i knew then where we were going for dinner. we went up to our room, freshened up and headed out.\n\nwe were quickly seated (it was a sunday night and the place was half full) and placed some drink orders. my wife had one of the specialty drinks which was quite good and i had some nigiri sake. we started off with the otsumami appetizer which came with edamame, shishito peppers and <mark>Green Bean Tempura</mark> with black truffle aioli. all 3 were excellent but we found ourselves fighting over the green beans and that yummy aioli. \n\nnext up was a mixture of ceviches and tiraditos. we tried 4 all together with both salmon and yellowtail. amazing flavor. the yellowtail ceviche taquitos were also amazing. i could eat those all day. we also had a couple of things from the robata grill. the stand out was the miso glazed <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>. it was incredible. so tasty. it was the best <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> i have ever had. period! the <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark> that came with it also was quite tasty.\n\nthe waitress recommended the mushroom toban-yaki with some grilled duck from the robata grill. it was so intense and earthy. i definitely got use of those umami tastebuds with this dish. loved every bit. after all that, we saved room for 2 speciality sushi rolls, the <mark>Samba Strip</mark> roll and the <mark>Neo Tokyo</mark> roll. both were amazing and filled with different flavors. \n\nall in all one of the best meais i have had in a while and i have had some amazing meals recently. if in vegas, you owe yourself. do it.", 
            "came in for lunch on a sunday, which was very quiet, but nice. \n\nsushi samba is a blend of japanese, brazilian and peruvian cuisine and they had plenty of dishes to choose from.\n\nwe got seated at the bar, which i find odd that you can't order straight from the sushi chefs that are standing right in front of you.  so it's like seating at the tables anyway, but your closer to the tvs and can stare at the fresh fishes available.  \n\nwe started with seared kobe beef- ponzu gele\\u00e9, warm japanese mushrooms, truffled tofu crema, i thought it was a little too salty, but overall, the dish was very good.  \n\nsashimi tiradito- yellowtail jalape\\u00f1o and lemongrass- the yellowtail was fresh and the sauce was good. it was more lemongrass tasting, didn't really taste the jalapeno. \n\nanticuchos which are two skewers served with <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark> (double the size of normal corn and a bit harder) <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> and miso- the fish was perfectly cooked and very tasty.  this was the most recommended dish and it was worth the try.  there was no fishy taste. \n\nsamba rolls- <mark>El Topo</mark>- salmon, jalape\\u00f1o, shiso leaf, fresh melted mozzarella, crispy onion- warm rolls, very tasty, melted right in my mouth.  \n\nfor sushi, their ika was good and their sake (salmon) was pretty darn fresh tasting. \n\ntheir green tea was also very good. i believe it's $5.  \n\noverall, the service was great and quick.  they came and refilled everything without asking.  food was good and i can't wait to come back to try everything else.",

            "yum, that's all i can really say. japanese-peruvian fusion with a raw bar menu, for me this is just a little piece of heaven. i've been a few times now and the food has been consistently good, the menu is nicely varied, and the service is decent too. even on a busy night i've never felt rushed. the servers are pretty helpful figuring out how much to order and don't try to oversell to make more $$$ which i've found to be common in other tapas style places.\n\nthe reason for only 3 stars is that the sushi is just average. really, i'd like to give a 3.5, if that could be done as there are a lot of other things to choose from. if you give this place a try, stick with the fusion dishes or small plates. save your sushi cravings for somewhere else. definitely try the miso glazed <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> skewers though; it's like crack.",

            "me and a couple buds of mine decided it would be a good idea to fine dine before heading back home from our trip to vegas. i found this spot out by a buddy of mine who happens to be a local, so i took his word for it and made a reservation here. it took us quite a while to get seated... we probably had to wait 20-30 minutes or so to get seated even though we had a reservation (it was a saturday, not quite sure how it would be on any other days).\n\nanyway our waitor was nice.. very knowledgable and friendly. the food was so yum. the boyfriend and i ordered a whole bunch of things- <mark>Rainbow Dragon</mark> roll, tiger <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark>, <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>, uni sushi, and after reading the previous reviews here on yelp, we ordered the yellowtail taquitos... so glad we did because they were delicious! pretty pricey for a small taco but totally worth it. the minimum you could order is 2 and they're $6 each. definitely would come back here for the taquitos and the sake!", 
            "what is there not to love about brazilians?\n\nbrazilian bbq, brazilian wax, brazilian models, and brazilian fusion.\n\nsushi samba is ahhh-mazing. i honestly thought the bf was overhyping the place and thought it would be mediocre, but i was surprised by the quality of the food and how delicious everything was!\n\nour waitress regina was nice and very bubbly. she made our dining experience at sushi samba great. instead of ordering random items off the menu, we chose the personalized prix fixe menu. basically, you tell your waiter/waitress what you like/dislike and the price limit per person and they basically bring out items that they think you would like.  if you don't like it, the waiter/waitress takes full responsibility for it and doesn't charge you. \n\nbetween the 3 of us, we had:\n- edamame: i'm not a fan of edamame so i rarely eat it and don't really care for it.\n- yellowtail crispy taquitos: this is a cold dish and it's like a sushi taco. the taquito had lemongrass, avocado, and aji panca miso. definitely recommend it!\n- <mark>Tuna Tataki</mark>: also another cold dish. very light and it had white asparagus, heart of palm, avocado, tatsoi, and citrus soy. i love anything with tuna in it so i enjoyed this a lot. \n- mushroom toban yaki w/ <mark>Filet Mignon</mark>: omg delicious! this came in a stone pot and had a bunch of <mark>Mixed <mark>Wild Mushrooms</mark></mark> and <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> in a delicious broth. \n- sashimi tiradito (yellowtail, kanpachi, tuna, and salmon): i didn't care too much for this dish. it was good but some of the sauce that accompanied the sashimi didn't blow me away. the yellowtail had a jalapeno and lemongrass sauce, the kanpachi had a yuzu, black truffle oil, and sea salt sauce, the tuna had a yuzu soy, hickory oil, and toasted garlic sauce, and the salmon had a maiz cancha, lime zest, and ponzu sauce. \n- <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> w/ a side of <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark>: this had to be one of the best <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> i've ever had in my life. it was cooked perfectly and had the perfect buttery, melt in your mouth texture. it was also marinated in a sweet sauce, but it wasn't too overpowering. the side of corn complemented the <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> very well.\n- <mark>Neo Tokyo</mark> roll, carnival roll, <mark>El Topo</mark> roll - i'm not the biggest fan of rolls and these rolls were a bit disappointing. especially since it came out last after all the really delicious dishes. i tried each of the rolls, but they weren't memorable.\n- carrot cake: oooooommmmmmmgggggggg! best carrot cake, ever. it was served with brown butter ice cream, cinnamon cream, rainbow carrot chip, and orange reduction. i seriously wanted to lick the plate after i was done!\n\nthe total per person (not including alcohol, tip, or tax) was about $65/per person. totally worth it! \n\nif you ever decide to try sushi samba, skip the rolls and go for the good stuff! i definitely recommend the personalized prix fixe menu.",

            "thursday night. 9pm. \nour reservations were honored to the minute and the man who runs the show, mike durovsik, at once made us feel not just like welcomed guests but old friends.\n\nmy fiance and i were indulged with a 9 course specialized server's omakase. the food was superb, and the service exceeds even the best definitions of accommodating. \n\nour charming and attentive server asked immediately how adventurous we were willing to get, and since we had no objections to anything particular, our meal immediately commenced.\n\nfirst was the otsumami, three small dishes: <mark>Green Bean Tempura</mark> with a creamy truffle aoli dipping sauce (incredible), shishito peppers charcoal grilled and just the right amount of spicy, as well as edamame sprinkled with sea salt.\n\nnext came hamachi (yellowtail) tacos paired with a fizzing sort of vinegarette (spicy aji panca) on the side to top it off- this was filled with so much flavour it literally forced my eyes to roll back. a real treat that i'd highly  reccommend.\n\nat this point it was quite apparent that service and timing was top notch. the bottle of sake we brought was being chilled tableside and water never fell below the 2/3rds mark. as the bottle chilled we tasted two different cocktails-  kumori, a cucumber cocktail with shochu and nigori which was refreshing, easy, and delicious.  alongside was the ever popular nina fresa, a strawberry cocktail with vodka. both made for easy, yet yummy drinking.\n\ntheir mushroom toban yaki was divinely creamy- we got ours with bincho tan grilled lamb on top which paired quite nicely with those garlic chips. their were five different kinds of perfectly cooked mushrooms in the mix, and all around it made for a <mark>Uni</mark> filling appetizer. my fiances words: that fu**ing amazing lamb dish ;)\n\nthe sashimi tiradito i'm always raving about came next. still on a midblowing level, i noticed that their are different flavour notes (though served with the same ingredients) for the nyc location and the las vegas one. so if you think you've had it before, you haven't. though different, the fish is always immensely fresh and the taste accents are truly wonderful. my favorite is the kanpachi since i'm a sucker for yuzu (japanese citrus) and my fiance was a big fan of the hamachi- if you're torn, go with the assortment of all four and you won't have any regrets.\n\noff the robata grill (bincho tan charcoal) came the most decadant <mark><mark>Alaskan King Crab</mark> Leg</mark> imaginable- our taste buds were literally in shock from the mastermind talents of chef oscar toro. bedded atop rock salt, the crab was creamy, fell apart smoothly, and the flavours enhanced the entire piece of already fresh seafood. a seasonal dish that may not always be available... so wonderful. if they don't have it on menu, go for the spiny lobster.\n\nalso from from the robata grill we enjoyed the miso glazed <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> with baby corn. again, this dish can be done so many different ways at different high end japanese restaurants- but sushi samba's brazillian take really heightens the tastes.\n\nask for the freshest oysters of the day- you can go with <mark><mark>Osetra Caviar Imperial 20g</mark> 20g</mark>, paired with yuzu jelly and lemon, or a more contemporary take which chef oscar toro will create specially for that oyster.- both ways are unforgettable.\n\nmy absolute favorite dish is the kobe ishiyaki. you grill fresh pieces of perfectly marbleized kobe tableside 3-5 seconds on each side on an extremely hot river stone. you get 4-5 sauces and and array of salts to mix up the taste buds for you- absolutely the most decadently delicious dish. whenever i see this i must have it, and sushi samba's is the best i've had. not enough people indulge in this and you must must must!!! \n\nour sushi/sashimi platter was fresh and wonderful- exquisite. we got the <mark>Neo Tokyo</mark> and the <mark>El Topo</mark> rolls- <mark>Neo Tokyo</mark> has tuna and a bit of spicy to it, and the <mark>El Topo</mark> is served warm- a surprising aspect, but the melted mozzarella is such a <mark>Uni</mark> addition. it's like the movie \"<mark>El Topo</mark>\" you must try/ see both! \n\nfor dessert we went with mochi; a soft and chewy japanese dessert that is <mark><mark>Osetra Caviar Imperial 20g</mark> 20g</mark> not overly sweet. sushi samba adds ice cream to the center and offers all the best flavours. \n\nby the end of our meal and a finished bottle of sake, we were both more than pleasantly buzzed and satiated with an incredible meal. \n\n\n**************\nbottom line, if you are trying to decide between nobu and sushi samba, pass on nobu and put some samba in your seafood!!\n\nthank you again mike and oscar for such a wonderful night!!",

            "my opinion/side note - i dont think its their sushi that makes this a good place to eat. but its the dishes that are not other sushi restaurant menus that makes it worth the cost.\n\nthis place is really good, only if you order the right things, because ordering something bad can cost you a pretty penny. i have been here twice and the 2nd time was much better because we all knew what we liked. \n\nthe chilean <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> on the robata grill section was probably my favorite rendition of chilean <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>. our waiter said the robata grill costs $1000 a day to operate? something like that. but wow it was good. you have to order off of this part of the menu if you are a fan of grilled food.\nprobably the only time i felt like a winner in vegas all weekend, just playing, kinda, lol.\n\nthe yellowfin taquitos were so <mark>Uni</mark>, and the foam chili sauce that came with it was the perfect compliment.\n\n<mark>El Topo</mark> - good but not great. table loved it though.\n\n<mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark> with black truffle aoili - if i ever make my dream of opening up a restaurant come true - this will be the first item on the menu. wowwww. it made a shrimp convert out of 1 the people at our table. but really how can u not like shrimp?\n\n\n-p", 
            "this place is amazing! probably one of the best dinner experiences i have had in a while.  the dishes are all so flavorful and beautifully presented.  everything is cooked perfectly. if you go there you have to try the <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> and the kobe beef taquitos. also, the giant <mark><mark>Alaskan King Crab</mark> Leg</mark> were unbelievable!  the atmosphere and service was great!

            "i had a sample of the tuna, yellowtail, and salmon in a different sauce and i must say it's quite amazing.  as i enjoy every bite of the fish i tried to dissect the sauce that was delicately woven into the fish; which was rather refreshing.  the <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> miso is also a must try; it's paired with a brazilian corn that was the sized of a penny so big and tasty.  if you like sashimi order the sashimi platter it's a better deal than ordering by the piece. \n\nthe decor is modern and very energetic.  a little of pizazz and lust.  i always adore coming here.", 
            "the atmosphere is cool: like what i imagine some urban japanese hot spot to be, haha. check out the mural on the wall--it'll keep you talking all night! they also had some video projector playing some cool clips on the wall. i loved it and the booths were big and round.\n\ni went here saturday night. at some point they brought out some dancing girls in skimpy outfits. i felt it was a tad out of place and noisy, but somewhat entertaining.\n\ni ordered the nina fresa, this delicious vodka cocktail with muddled strawberries. yum.\n\nour party ordered a lot of things. the <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> skewers were to die for--definitely order some. i also enjoyed the jalapeno yellowtail. it was served with these large brazilian(?) corn kernels. the sashimi was good, too! those were the only dishes i remember. oh, the neo-tokyo roll was super plain and required salty soy sauce to give it any taste. everything was good though, not amaziiiiing.\n\nit's def a schlep to get here from the entrance of the palazzo, but worth it! i had a blast, but wouldn't have enjoyed it if i had to pay (but that's everywhere in vegas, no?).",

            "these 5 stars goes to the lady who was so damn good at her job by fulfilling every aspect of our dining experience that the food was more like a plus. i wish i got her name to credit her but we were a party of 8 girls staggering in late in high heels for our dear friend's bachelorette reserved dinner on a saturday night a week ago.\nwe got the run down quickly on doing their style of \"omakase\" after mentioning we had a show and had to finish by 9pm. we gave her free rein with a price per person between $30 to $40.\nnow, i was the only one who had been here before for the same concept so i was expecting the same good service and food. so i discreetly asked the lady server to make sure to add the miso <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> skewers. she happily replied, \"i gotchu girl!\" \nwe were then offered the extensive sake and wine menu, which we had to forgo. and one of the girls almost ordered the cucumber martini but didn't.  \nafter the time it took for a buzzed dude to walk over, show us his awesome swim trunks, (clearly forgetting to dress his bottoms to match his sharp shirt), wink and share a charming smile, and then leave...our appetizers were presented by a team of 3 servers.\n- otsumami: trio of edamame, tempura green beans with amazing truffle dip, grilled shishito pepper :)\n- pork gyozas (ok)\n- <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark> (wasn't as succulent or saucy but still good)\n\nour waters were always filled. thank you water guy!\n\nthen after enjoying our appz for about 20 mins, came out the yummiful skewers, 3 specialty rolls of sushi (could have asked for the <mark>El Topo</mark> roll but decided try the others) and an entree split by 2 plates to share. it was the teriyaki chicken with fried onions atop mashed purple potatoes. this is so yum because the chicken was juicy and flavorful!\n\nwe were having our fill and we were on schedule. then the lady server got us a surprise sake tree of their cucumber martini! also very refreshing and yum to end our meal.  we had to pack a bit of to-go and we were happy with the service. she lined our meal down the middle of our price range to about $36/person (plus tax+tip $45).\nso exceeded my last experience here!  i recommend the omakase style because the servers really do know the menu. trust!", 
            "even though it is on the pricier side, it was worth it. my soul was happy with me after i ate here. in fact, my soul asked me to eat twice here. i happily obliged. the first time we were only there for a quick snack and a drink, but the second time we actually ate a meal there, so i'll review the second time. \n\ni should give one caveat: i'm not particularly familiar with authentic brazilian or japanese food. that said, i found this fusion restaurant both intriguing and completely intoxicating. \n\nthe waitress we had the first time was good, but i really remember our second waiter, max. he was very attentive and gave fantastic recommendations, but wasn't pushy about it. most importantly, you can tell he's actually excited about the food. it made a huge difference, because seeing someone so excited to tell you about the ingredients, how the food is prepared, and what flavors are going on together really adds to a wonderful food experience, in my opinion. the waiter ended up recommending a $60 per person meal, a tasting menu of sorts. it sounds like a lot, but given the prices, it was really very fair considering the amount of food we got. as such, i'm not going to talk about every little thing, but more the highlights. \n\nthe <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark> was addicting. it was a little closer to the hominy side of the corn spectrum, but it was buttery and had just a bit of texture. if it doesn't come as a side, i absolutely recommend trying it as a separate side dish. it does come as a side to the <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> skewers, which i think were my single most favorite thing i tried there. it was buttery and delicious, and so flavorful in little bites. i wish i could describe it better than just \"flavorful,\" but i'm not even sure how to describe how delicious it was. i'll just say that while i was eating it, i hoped it would never stop (so inappropriate but i can't help it: that's what she said). \n\nhamachi tacos and a plate of various sashimi were incredible. i liked the sashimi just a little more because the bold flavors of the sauces surprisingly married well with the fish flavor, without overpowering it. \n\nthe most surprising part of the night: there was a sushi roll that included melted mozzerella. yes. mozzerella and salmon. i was so skeptical of this one, and it took me a few tries to get used to it, but once i did, it was like a warm blanket. if you can push aside the weirdness, it's a good roll. \n\nanother piece of fabulosity we had was a yellowtail seviche (they do spell it with an \"s\"). it was tangy but still let the other flavors show, and that is one of the items (along with the <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>) i will absolutely order again next time i am in vegas. \n\nlast, but certainly not least, the waiter concocted a duck hot-pot for us. i've not had much exposure to duck, and was weary of this one, but it was in a buttery sauce with lots of mushrooms, and it was incredibly silky and rich. needless to say, after all this food, we were stuffed!!! and of course, very happy. the manager came out to talk to us about the food as well, and i thought that was nice. \n\ni also tried the cucumber martini and the blackberry mojito. the mojito was good, but not particularly special. the cucumber martini, on the other hand, was light and refreshing and absolutely amazing. \n\nsushi samba is definitely first on my list next time i come to vegas!", 
            "i don't believe it is possible to give a better rating.  we went to vegas for my wife's birthday.  the was our last night, and we wanted to go out for the last time.  we had already eating diner a couple of hours before hand.  so we figured we would go for a late night snack.  we went to sushi samba, and could not have made a better decision.\n\nwe were pretty indecisive about what to order.  so our waitress suggested that we answer a few of her questions, and she would suggest a meal for us.  that was perfect.  we had the yellow tail tacos which was delicious.  very light, and refreshing.  then we had the <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> skewers.  amazing sauce, and was great.  then we ended up with the <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark>.  great meal.  great suggestions.\n\nbut the topper was the owner liz.  she came over to our table.  she was very welcoming, and actually talked to us.  i didn't feel as if she was doing it, as part of some shtick.  she was very genuine.  which was cool. \n\nwe ended the night with a vanilla chocolate cake for my wife's birthday.  overall great experience.  when we go back to vegas.  this will definitively be one of our stops.", 
            "this was our go to late night place while staying at the venetian. we opted to sit at the bar and try their happy hour specials along with a few things off their menu.\n\ni woud highly recommend the miso chilean <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>, as it was once of the best i have ever had. the vegetables that came with it were so tender and delicious, even though i hate brussels sprouts, the rest were quite good.\n\nthe <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> rolls were really good also, though small compared to other places i've had them.\n\nthe best vegetable dish i've had in a long time were the collard greens in an asian dressing. they were crunchy and filling enough for two. though, next time i'm not sharing! \n\nanother stand out to me were the fried plantains. normally, restaurants cut them thick and serve them with sides of beans and sour cream. i loved that these were cut thin and lightly breaded, deep fried and sprinkled only with some shavings of cheese. \n\nbesides the <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>, the items we got were only $5-6 bucks a dish and easily can be split by two. this was probably my favorite place to dine while there and probably one of the better late night dining options you have if you don't feel like burgers or sandwiches.\n\ni would have loved to give them a full 5 stars but the bar people were much to slow in not only forgetting to ask our order but forgetting to bring us our drinks after having to ask  three times, while serving those who just sat down right away. otherwise, the food was fantastic!",

            "this restaurant caught my eye because it was something out of the ordinary from your typical sushi restaurant. the menu offered an intriguing variety but when i began reading the reviews i knew i had to try it. i would suggest anyone going there for the first time to try the dining experience because you may think you know what you want but the chef knows better! the server asks if there is anything you do not like or if you have any food allergies and then how much money per person you're looking to spend. there are options anywhere from $50 per person to $130 per person if kobe beef if something that interests you. as it was for a special occasion we opted for $80 per person and even though thats more than i have probably ever spent on a single meal there were no regrets.\n\ncourse #1 consisted of berkshire pork gyoza which is basically pork dumplings in a pumpkin puree and yellowtail ceviche taquitos, both of which were absolutely delicious and not necessarily something i would have ordered on my own.\n\ncourse #2 was yellowtail sashimi in a spicy peruvian sauce with a slice of red jalapeno on top and octopus sashimi in a japanese citrus sauce which again were both to die for!\n\ncourse #3 had an array of <mark>Filet Mignon</mark>, <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>, <mark>Alaskan King Crab</mark> and <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark>. all were moist and tender but the <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> absolutely melted in your mouth! <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark> was a yummy alternative to <mark><mark>Osetra Caviar Imperial 20g</mark> 20g</mark> as well.\n\nfinally, course #4 was the main sushi dinner. <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark> rolls were delicious, but the <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> with i believe tuna on top was absolutely amazing! there was also <mark>Half Maine Lobster</mark> and another roll which i believe had lobster in it as well and was probably the only thing of the entire dinner that i was not absolutely amazed with, but it was still good!\n\nanother great thing about this place is they tell you if there is anything throughout this meal you do not like they will take it back and bring you something else! as our server said, \"its like a money back guarantee!\"\n\nanyways this is definitely a place i would tell everyone who loves trying new things to try or even just the sushi lover. do it! it will not disappoint!\n\nonly part i would complain about is the fact that there is not one in california!!!", 
            "this was definitely one of the best dining experiences i've had in lv. we called a few hours ahead to make reservations at 8:45pm on a friday night. the restaurant was packed and the decor is absolutely gorgeous. \n\nfor 2 we had:\n\n- edamame organic soybeans, sea salt, lime\n- <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark> golden pea shoot, snap pea jullienne, spicy mayo, black truffle vinaigrette\n- beef tenderloin and aji panca anticuchos\n- miso-marinated chilean <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> roasted organic vegetables and oshinko\n- bobo brazil roll* <mark>Seared W<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> Beef</mark>, avocado, kaiware, shiso, red onion, chimichurri\n- green envy* tuna, salmon, asparagus, wasabi pea crust, aji amarillo-key lime mayo\n\neverything was delicious! the <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark> and <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> were amazing. i wasn't a huge fan of the beef anticuchos, they were seasoned almost too much. the rolls were pretty small and didn't stand out as much as the other food. service was on point, and i would definitely come back!",

            "sushi samba is the best it can get! the chef's tasting menu is the way to go. i can't even fully describe how amazing everything we had was. we started off with the edamame, shisito and <mark>Green Bean Tempura</mark>. the shishito are seared and roasted peppers, which were spicy but good. the tempura was amazing with this black truffle alioli that i wanted to drizzle on everything!\n\nthen came chicken gyoza, which was so tender on top of pumpkin puree. before we knew it they were bringing out rolls, one tuna and one with fresh crab. i was starting to feel full, when all of a sudden came the miso <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> and beef tenderloin skewers. they were served with this <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark> that i haven't been able to stop thinking about since.the kernels are the size of quarters!  and i didn't even get to mention the nice cocktail list until now, so you know the food was good.\n\nall in all it was one of the best meals i've had in a really long time. they also had a similar sized spread for my friend who is a vegetarian and graciously agreed to go with us.", 
            "not impressed.  the food here is good, but you're paying for the \"club\" ambiance, not the quality of food .  everything is overpriced for what you're getting, and comparing them to other sushi restaurants on the strip, i would spend my money elsewhere.  i did like the <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>, but other than that, i didn't care for the food.   \nwe did the omakase dinner, so we had a large selection of their menu, but i couldn't really get myself excited about anything we tried.  i wasn't happy about the steaming rock we had to cook our meat on either...it made myself and my friend smell like smoke the remainder of the night.  for almost $100/person, i would have rather tried somewhere else.", 
            "when my boyfriend proposed dinner at sushisamba i wasn't 100% sure what to expect. naturally, i immediately assumed it was sushi with a bit of a twist, but i didn't really expect the menu they had in store! they offered a very cool japanese, peruvian and brazilian fusion (not your everyday mash-up!) and everything was executed brilliantly. i was a touch put off at the outset when the waiter told us that he could create a dinner experience for us without much of our input. after finding out about food allergies, dietary restrictions, etc. he gave us a ballpark of about $50 - $60 per person and took it from there. we, quite literally, ordered nothing off of the menu - everything that we ate was something that our waiter thought would be a hit for us. while i was skeptical, it actually worked out well! he brought us some amazing dishes (the corn that accompanies the <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> is insanely good and the ahi tacos were stellar) though we could have probably done with a couple fewer dishes. we left absolutely stuffed and very impressed. \n\ni'm sure we could have kept it under $100 (not including drinks) if we were to order on our own (we got a lot of food, including a few orders that probably wouldn't have been on our agenda), but if you're okay with the price range laid out, they do know their stuff! all around good experience. i would go again, but now that we've tried quite a few things, i would prefer to place my own order. :)", 
            "portions are so insanely small. i hardly ever finish a plate and these were tiny even for me. the chilean <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> was to die for but after spending a fortune and still feeling starved afterwards i just would not ever return.",

            "i want to like this place so much.  the food that we got was delicious (the <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> skewers are amazingly soft and flaky, and the black truffle sauce that comes with the fried green beans is tdf), but the service we got was horrible.  our server was fine--she was upbeat and tried to work with our wants, but whomever it was that also talked to us was horrible.  \n\nto be fair, we were a large group (about 14 or 15), and understandably it is hard to accommodate such a large group, let alone trying to get our food out at the same time.  honestly, i could care less if my food came out at the same time as the people i had been sitting with.  before we could even look at the menus to see what was available a la carte, the restaurant pushed us into this 'tasting menu' that would \"incorporate our tastes as well as some of their classic dishes\"--sounds fine, but in a group of 14 or 15 people who have very varied tastes, that is almost impossible to do.  to begin with, some of our group members didn't eat any raw fish, and others were basically only interested in raw fish.  we eventually agreed to this tasting menu just out of an unwillingness to continue \"fighting\".  they tried to appease by sending us some shooters and edamame, grilled shishito peppers, and fried green beans to start.  great, and thanks, but still not the best service you could ask for at a restaurant like here. \n\nif this rating were about the food only, i would give it 5 stars.  the food really is delicious, and the decor (while strange) goes well with the feel that the restaurant seems to be going for.  the pork in our meat sampler platter was overdone and dry, but two types of beefs that were perfectly cooked made up for it.  the appetizer of some sort of spicy tempura rock shrimp salad was moist with the perfect amount of chewiness and spring; it's spicy, but not in the give-me-milk-to-guzzle-now way.  the sushi that we were served, however, was pretty sub-standard.  i'm sure this was because it had to fall in line with our tasting menu price point (which somehow got haggled down); honestly, i did not come to sushisamba just to get <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> rolls.. i could get that anywhere. \n\nin short, come here if you're in a small group.  the food really is worth it, many times over.  i'm sure it will be a far more amazing trip than the one i had in a large group.", 
            "my favorite thing about this restaurant is the option of having a \"custom menu.\" for a flat per person fee, you can ask your waiter (ours was max, who was incredibly attentive and friendly) to order your food for you. as a restaurant with three kitchens (japanese, brazillian & peruvian, don't quote me on that last one), the diversity of dishes you can consume is great. \n\nevery time a dish was brought out for us, max would sit down for a couple seconds and explain each dish. it was really fun not knowing what came out next! for about $70/person (with tip) we got:\n\ndumplings and ceviche\nfour types of sashimi\n<mark>Peruvian Corn</mark> & grilled miso <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>\nalbacore tuna roll & <mark>El Topo</mark> roll\nbraised <mark>Duck Breast</mark> with japanese mushrooms\n\nall of which were amazing. do the \"custom menu.\" it's what makes this place <mark>Uni</mark> and fun!",

            "the dinner was fantastic. i had a hard time choosing so i had the waitress choose. she picked the <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> sushi.  pork gioza, <mark>Salt and Pepper Squid</mark>, <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>. everything was great until we decided not to have dessert. the waitress's attitude completely changed.",

            "my friend wanted to celebrate her tax return and take me to lunch (hooray for me!!) she wanted to have sushi on the strip, well mostly all the sushi restaurants on the strip don't open until dinner, except sushisamba, so that's where we landed.  while we waited for them to open, i was scoping yelp reviews to see what we should order. the <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark> seemed to be the #1 suggestion, so that's what we started out with.  neither  one of us were impressed, sorry to say, but i felt like i was eating just a giant piece of corn kernal. but it was all uphill from there. \n\nour server, drago, was very attentive and full of suggestions, he had asked if we dined here before and i told him i had been to the one in miami, then he said he would bring us something on the house for coming back. when i tell you, you must order these, i'm not exaggerating, they were excellent, not on the menu, <mark>Broiled Peruvian Bay Scallop</mark>, prepared differently than the one on the menu. they were so good we had to order another round. i am a huge fan of yellowtail, so we ordered the yellowtail taquitos, so tasty, i loved the crunch that the mini taco shell added to the yellowtail flavor. next up was a table favorite as well, <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> miso, it melted in your mouth.  i was skeptical at first, they are served on a skewer, so i wasn't expecting the amazing flavor i tasted when i took my first bite. drago suggested the <mark>El Topo</mark> roll, both of us like hot,, super spicy food, this roll had a nice kick at the end, i normaily don't like any kind of dairy on my sushi rolls, i.e. cream cheese, etc....but this had melted mozzarella, it was excellent. then came the grand finale, my friend is a huge kobe beef fan so she wanted to try the <mark>Seared W<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> Beef</mark>, excellent <mark>Grade A5</mark>5, ishi yaki hot stone, dipping sauces, vegetables. presentation was so nice, lots of different sauces to try.  dessert, yes we still had room for dessert, we tried the peruvian hot chocolate con cr\\u00e8me served with <mark><mark>Osetra Caviar Imperial 20g</mark> 20g</mark> and the coco duo dark and white chocolate custard with praline. the second one was by far the best. a must. also try the house made iced tea, they mix fresh orange juice, lime juice and lemon with black tea.....think i drank a pitcher of it.  good food, service, ambiance!", 
            "treat yourself and your friends and eat here!\nif you suggest this place, your friends and loved ones will be forever thankful.\n\nconveniently, located inside the palazzo, sushisamba is one word, amazing!\nit not only offers great food, but you get to dine in a cool setting in an awesome hotel.\nthe tables are kinda cramped, but the great food and great service are worth dealing with the minor inconvenience. \n\ni definitely recommend the small plates and the miso <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>. delicious!\nutilize opentable, and you won't have to wait for a table.", 
            "i almost want to give this a 5. near oh my god moment, but not quite.\n\nthis is a little misleading. i swear this came up under \"chinese\" on yelp while we were looking for something (in a group <mark><mark>Assortment of Four</mark></mark>) but this is definitely not chinese. it's japanese brazilian fusion, which i had never had, but was awesome. the menu is a bid daunting, but the waitress offered to bring out a tasting menu for us, based on the common questions like, \"are you ok with raw fish,\" \"do you have allergies,\" \"how do you eat red meat,\" etc. this was helpful - usually i'm not fazed by the large menu, but for some reason i was having problems focusing. worth mentioning they say up front that they'll take back anything we don't like, no charge, and they do ask for a budget to keep them in line.\n\nwhat we got was really pretty exceptional. gyoza steamed and pan fried, hamachi taquitos (not what you're thinking - not the deep fried rolls, but little taco shells filled with hamachi sashimi), seared tuna with baby greens and crunchy salt, and portabella fries with kabocha aioli. all sounds fancy, all really good.\n\nthen a warm plate - grilled <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> with a sweet glaze, <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> (not their a5 w<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark>, which we were offered for an upcharge, but declined) and <mark><mark>Alaskan King Crab</mark> Leg</mark>, all with a side of elote. the bass was good - tender and flaky, and i like the glaze. but it was crazy overpowered by the beef and crab. firstly, the beef was far superior to what we had at n9ne. tender, flavorful, and with a great salt and pepper crust on the outside, served with a little pile of powdered chile for dipping. and the crab was that near oh my god moment. an *enormous* <mark><mark>Alaskan King Crab</mark> Leg</mark>, brushed with a sort of thick butter sauce, served piping hot. wow, this was exceptional. and while i guess i should expect it, points to the restaurant for realizing that serving a filet and a <mark><mark>Alaskan King Crab</mark> Leg</mark> family style to diners that have only chopsticks required that you slice things up in to nice little bite sized pieces.\n\nfinally, sushi. their <mark>Neo Tokyo</mark> roll, which is their version of the <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark>, a hamachi roll with spicy crab and avocado on top, a tuna roll with asparagus, dusted with wasabi, and an assortment of sashimi and nigiri. as well as a hot roll - something covered in melted mozzarella, crispy onions and a sweet sauce. all of the cold rolls were good - i especially liked their <mark>Neo Tokyo</mark> roll. the sashimi was also very good, but the hot roll...i could do without. it was in interesting twist - not just the cheese was hot, but the entire roll, rice and all. however, the cheese and a heaping helping of onion and sauce overpowered whatever might have been inside. this was about the only misstep i could find.\n\nthe atmosphere is odd - lots of pounding techno music, along with an odd video collage (on many many video screens) of brazilian beach babes, bullet trains, brazilian slums, and japanese salarymen trudging to their soul-murdering jobs. not sure what they were going for. but whatever.\n\ngreat spot - chinese though it wasn't, we all were appropriately full when it was over (not hungry, no stuffed) and we all agreed we'd be back. the total bill, excluding drinks, was probably about $65 per person. i loved the mix of appetizers, hot beef and seafood, and sushi. if you're going with a group, this is a fun way to try stuff without having to worry about reading a menu.", 
            "we were in vegas and this sushi spot is off the hook we got the $40 per person option and they brought us brazilian food portuguese food and sushi and everything was amazing specially the <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>. if your in vegas and want good food this is the place but just to let you know before hand it's a bit pricey. for 8 people with two bottles of hot sake and three bottles of asa hi beer the total was like $700", 
            "it was a good experience to try something new in sushi, but there was nothing that really stood out in taste that would make me return. we took a lot of the server's recommendations for popular items like the specialty dishes <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> with <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark> and yellowtail taquitos served like tapas, which were both good. the <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark> was ok, but didn't seem to have a complimenting taste with the <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>. we let the server know and he brought out some <mark>Purple Potato Mash</mark> just to try something different and it was better than the corn. \n\nthe service was great. our server was very knowledgeable about the food, how it was prepared and the types of sake that was offered. we enjoyed 4 different <mark>Sake</mark>, which was more enjoyable than the sushi. \n\nif you want to feel like you ate a lot, stick with mostly rolls... the rice will help fill you up.\n\ntypical price for food in lv... $$$... although i didn't think we ordered that much and the cost was just short of the 200 mark for two.\n\ngood brazilian/peruvian fusion... but if i had a choice between this and <mark><mark>Osetra Caviar Imperial 20g</mark> 20g</mark>... obviously traditional.", 
            "my friends and i were strolling through the palazzo last evening looking for some good eats.  we were pulled in by stunning smells illuminating from sushi samba's cozy corner restaurant.  service from the start was top notch.  we decided to sit bar-side.  the sous chef, robert, came out and gave us a personal welcome for our first visit; followed by a generous on-the-house appetizer.  sea scallop with pesto magic.  one bite was packed full of a fresh, balanced flavor that took my taste buds to a place they haven't been in many years.  after one bite, i knew we had come to the right place.\n\non recommendation from the chef - we ordered <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> with veggies and a sweet miso drizzle.  now to me, <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> if very rarely billed as a \"main course\" but wow - this dish was spectacular.  a must try for any fan of the sea.  the cocktails are inventive, <mark>Uni</mark> and balanced.  try one of their special sake martini's - tastes like you've never had before.  \n\nsushi samba is the real deal.  they made it perfectly clear that the restaurant intends to better serve their customers and grow it's gourmet creations .  all of their products are the pinnacle of fresh.  no doubt restocked daily.  the presentation of everything from drinks to dinner was carefully crafted with intention and purpose.  quick service and an aim-to-please attitude top to bottom made us feel more like we were clients than customers.\n\nwe ended the night with a round of delicious fruit sake cocktails and a heart-felt thank you to allen, the manager on duty.  in my opinion, the pricing is quite appropriate given the freshness, quality, service and atmosphere.  they nailed it, bravo!\n\nso if you're a fan of fine dinning, service, sushi or delicious cocktails - i highly recommend you make plans to visit sushi samba. \n\nthanks for the incredible evening sushi samba, i'll be back soon!",

            "great fusion restaurant with a nice mix of small plates and interesting entrees. my favorite dish is the \"<mark>Moqueca Mista</mark>\" - a rice dish covered in a ton of seafood \"curry\". the flavor of the sauce is perfect and not overly sweet or coconut-flavored. \n\nwe also tried:\n1. crispy yellowtail taquitos - so good and perfectly crispy \n2. ceviche +tiradito combo of 4 - nothing special\n3. <mark>Berkshire Pork Belly</mark> robata - a little too sweet with the butterscotch miso \n4. <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> robata - also a bit too sweet\n5. salt + <mark>Salt and Pepper Squid</mark> - yum, this was fried with a lot of flavor\n6. <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark> - a bit too much mayo-sauce for my taste\n\noverall this was our second visit and if you order just the right things (i would stick with the fried appetizers and <mark>Moqueca Mista</mark>) then it's a great meal. it's pricey - but hey, it's vegas so i'm not really factoring that into my review. i would definitely go back again!",

            "ever since i came here the first time i went to vegas, i've been dying to come back.\n\nthe food is so good!  i thought we just got lucky the first time we came, but as it turns out, everything we've tried on the menu thus far is delicious.\n\nambiance is classy and cool.  it's a nice location within the palazzo hotel with lots of seats.  service was also good, as my water glass was always full despite being very busy on a friday night at midnight.\n\nwe got:\n\n<mark>Moqueca Mista</mark> - shrimp, squid, <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>, coconut milk, roasted cashew, dende oil, chimichurri rice - $29 - http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sushisamba-las-vegas?select=t4jwaobhrbkbp4vr92x4ua#t4jwaobhrbkbp4vr92x4ua\n\nthis thing is the best ever.  creamy thai-style curry taste (hence coconut milk) with the delicate seafood mixed in with bits of crushed cashews, giving the dish great texture.  rice was served within the sauce mixture as shown; the rice soaked up all the sauce, making every morsel divine.  i thought after a while the dish would get too rich-tasting, but somehow i kept gobbling and gobbling until the plate was empty!\n\n<mark>El Topo</mark> sushi roll - salmon, jalape\\u00f1o, shiso leaf, fresh melted mozzerella, crispy onion - $15 (forgot to take a pic; too excited about the <mark>Moqueca Mista</mark>)\n\nvery <mark>Uni</mark> roll with interesting flavors and textures = delicious!\n\nchicken teriyaki - samba style <mark>Organic Chicken</mark>, aji amarillo, <mark>Purple Potato Mash</mark>, crispy onion - $26 (again forgot to take a pic...)\n\nwhen i saw the huge price tag i thought \"wtf?!\", especially for a seemingly simple plate as chicken teriyaki (my friend ordered this one so i had no control).  buttt i'll have to say that it was probably the best teriyaki chicken i've ever had in my life!  super juicy fillets of teriyaki chicken, pan fried (i think) to a crisp.  the sauce was perfect; not too saucy, not too dry, and definitely not overpowering to the dish.\n\nas with all finer dining restaurants, especially on the las vegas strip, i did think the prices were a little inflated.  hence the lack of that final star.  however, probably one of my favorite places to eat while in vegas.  i'll definitely hit it up again on future trips.  they have a good happy hour too (both early evening and late night), so i'll have to take advantage of that next time! :)", 
            "great ambiance, decent food.\na lot of people have recommended this restaurant, but i think it's a bit overrated. \ni love sushi.  although the sushi was well presented, they didn't taste like anything spectacular.  surprisingly not too many rolls to choose from even though they try to create some original specialty rolls.  \n\n<mark>Neo Tokyo</mark> roll - <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> inside, tuna outside.  this roll was just ok.  it just tastes like <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark>.\n\n<mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> skewers - probably our only favorite dish.  comes with corn.\n\n<mark>El Topo</mark> roll - good, sorta like a crunchy roll, crispy onions and mayo on top.\n\n<mark>Berkshire Pork Belly</mark> ramen - highly recommended by server, but a huge disappointment.  it was a failed attempt.  the broth was clear and bland.  it tasted like instant ramen with a hint of tom yum soup flavoring.  nothing like ramen at all.  \n\nsushisamba has good food, it just didn't show me anything new or exciting except that you're in a really nice restaurant, but you're paying for it.", 
            "i'm so glad i made reservations here\n\ni wanted to reserve a place that wasn't italian or heavy in the venetian or palazzo for my group of 8 girls.  we arrived a little early for our reservation and was seated immediately.  my cousin told the waiter what we liked and didn't like.  he said he would create a meal according to what we wanted.  everything was fantastic.  below is what we had and its description:\n\npork gyozo-  each dumpling was served on a delicious pumpkin puree.  delicious!\n\nsushi platter- we got 5 different types of rolls, 2 of each type.  they were all so good.  \n\ntiger rock shrimp- yum!  if you like honey walnut shrimp then you will definitely like this.  it was perfectly made.  \n\nyellowtail ceviche tacos- these were the best tacos i have ever had.  the sauce it came with was a yummy spicy foam hot sauce.  they were small but definitely satisfying.  they just melt in your mouth.  so good!  probably my favorite thing there.  \n\nsteak- the steak was served with collard greens, potatoes, rice, and black beans.  it also came out with 3 different sauces that were all so good.  the green sauce was my favorite.  \n\n<mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> on skewers- this was served with some <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark>.  the <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> just melts in your mouth.  they were perfectly made.  the corn was also really good and went perfectly with the <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>.     \n\nshots- our shots came out beautifully presented on a shot tier.  two of us didn't drink so our waiter brought out two that were watermelon juice so we could join in on toasting.    \n\ndessert- dessert was a mix of the best vanilla ice cream, creme burlee, mixed berries, and banana.  it was nicely made and topped off with some sparklers.  \n\neverything was so tasty and beautifully presented.  the food wasn't just all japanese.  it was definitely a fusion but everything went together wonderfully.  i think for us 8 girls it was about $75 each.  it was very worth it and we all left stuffed and happy.      \n\nour server took care of us really well.  i liked that he noted there were 8 of us and made the portions perfect for 8 girls.  one of our girls couldn't eat raw fish or anything spicy and he made sure she got her own individual thing.  he also made note that two of us couldn't drink and brought out shots for everyone with 2 virgin drinks.  he made great recommendations and was helpful.  he also took time to take a couple photos for us.  as for the the ambiance, it was beautiful.  we had a great time celebrating.", 
            "food is pretty good, wait staff is really nice and great service but it's ridiculously overpriced. get sushi somewhere else if that's what you're looking for. \n\ndid their sampler menu which includes sushi, seafood and kobe beef. nothing tasted bad....but it was $150 a person. one out of the 9 items brought to the table was memorable - the <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> on a stick. oh, and the $8 double shot of espresso that woke me up ;). \n\ncost our group of 7 over $1k. not that much food. outrageously priced and you can get way better (more interesting and flavorful) sushi for a fraction of the cost. nice service and wait staff though. unless you're rich don't waste your money. nice of them to give us birthday shooters of a tasty pink lemonade shooter.", 
            "this is a \"must go\" place for me while in vegas. \n\nwe always give the server a budget and have them surprise us.   they always pick things you wouldn't naturally gravitate towards, but are amazing dishes!   my favorites are:  <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>, yellow tail tacos, crab cakes, and <mark><mark>Alaskan King Crab</mark> Leg</mark>.   \n\ngreat customer service as well!", 
            "i wasn't feeling sushi, but i went with it. \nmy expectations were low, just another sushi bar in vegas...\nwe gave our server, veronica, a per-person budget and let her pick.\n\n i was blown away!\n\nwe were served mini tacos, <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> skewers, sashimi ceviche, <mark>Seared W<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> Beef</mark>, salt & <mark>Salt and Pepper Squid</mark> and more. the plates just kept coming. how did they get such incredible flavors into the food? i would put sushisamba up against the best. sure, nobu (malibu) may have great atmosphere, but the flavors, quality, variety, and probably 100 different <mark>Sake</mark> here, make them a strong competitor. \n\n\nservice was impeccable (ask for veronica).", 
            "located in the shoppes at palazzo casino. my original plan was to get some comps redeemed for grand lux cafe (which is a great place as well). to my surprise, i had over 100 bucks available...i don't remember playing in the venetian poker room that much, but oh well. a bigger surprise, they had a long list of places i could use comps at, including steakhouses, and here. this is not the norm for vegas poker rooms. i guess this could be a venetian poker room review as well; they treat their customers very well! so i decided to try this place. \n\ni'm very glad that i did! my waitress isabella was very attentive, thorough, and answered any questions i had. top notch service! the rest of the waitstaff was even friendlier. my table was periodically kept clean, and lots of refills kept coming. \n\ni was expecting to eat regular sushi, maybe a tasting menu. and i never really thought of what the samba part meant. but i looked at the menu and there were lots of options available, fusion-style: from brazilian steaks to <mark><mark>Osetra Caviar Imperial 20g</mark> 20g</mark> rolls. i was in for an unexpected and different, yet very satisfying meal. \n\n-samba tea: this is a must try! i forgot what they were, but they included many different types of ingredients; the result being one of my favorite teas, if not my favorite. \n-bobo brazil samba roll: <mark>Seared W<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> Beef</mark>, brazilian-japanese style...something new and amazing!\n-miso-marinated chilean <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>...so good! one of the best fish i've ever had.\n-20oz <mark>Bone in Ribeye</mark> steak: juicy and delicious. loved the flavor! goes very well with the sushisamba dipping sauces. \n-warm chocolate banana cake (maple butter, banana chip, vanilla rum ice cream)...awesome!\n\nservice: 5/5; food: 5/5!\n\nthis was a <mark>Uni</mark> and awesome dining experience for me. and it looks like there's plenty more to try! thanks sushisamba. i would definitely come back!", 
            "to start off i was not expecting to be blown away with this place but i was!! everything from this restaurant was beyond my expectations.\nwent there for a special treat and oh my... we had one.\n\nfirst off i would not say the sushi is extraordinary, in fact its standard but i did love the yellow tail scallion there more than i do at most places, but the items on the menu other than sushi is what got me!\n\nfirst and for most  the drink tower is amazing and <mark>Uni</mark> from the appearance to all the different varieties like the cucumber one, strawberry, grapefruit, and so on...we tried total of 6!!. my favorite was the one with the cucumber and the one with the mint cant recall the actual names due to all the drinks ; ) \n\nnow on to the mealsssss the ones i loved would have to be the steak tacos, best i had in a really long time and the sauce that they come with has a little kick that makes it all so complete. another one would have to be the <mark><mark>Alaskan King Crab</mark> Leg</mark> cut in perfect portions to be grabbed with the chop sticks and topped off with a cream sauce was sooooooooo good!! there was also the miso <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> if you like the taste of the miso flavor and appreciate <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> like i do its a must, even though my last bite on the skewer was not as great as the first 3 ; ( and my favorite dish of the whole night would have to be the in shell <mark>Scallop</mark>!!!! i had never seem my <mark>Scallop</mark> served in a shell till i went to this place, they were cooked with perfection and had some sort of pesto butter topping them off. i can literally eat so many and never have enough!! \none more dish worth mentioning would have to be the tempura shrimp even though i am not a fan of most fried foods this one was good!! and the portion was giant!\n\nas far as the dessert i am usually one to clear out all the plates but this was not the case for me, we got the mochi variety dish but it was too frozen it didn't do the mochi justice, and our other dessert consisted of friend bananas (which i am not a fan of) and coconut cream and the best coffee ice cream i have ever had! this meal was a fun teat and experience and the staff was amazing! \n\nanother tip on the side is make reservations, it was packed when we got there...", 
            "an excellent fusion of japanese, brazilian, and peruvian.  what i found different about this establishment compared to others is the approach of ordering from their menu.  our waiter asked us for a price range we're willing to spend.  an example range is $60-$120.  my brother (who's birthday we're celebrating) said about $80 per person.  next, the waiter asks us what our likes, dislikes, allergies, etc in order to create a <mark>Uni</mark> dining experience for us.  my brother basically said he doesn't want to eat sushi (he didn't feel like it that day), wants to try the gyoza, and definitely want to sample the kobe beef.  after our drinks arrived, we waited about 10-20 minutes before our appetizers and entrees came.\n\nwe tried a variety of food which ranged from gyozas, skewers, <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>, and kobe beef.  the main attraction is the kobe beef where they bring a large stone that's heated to 700 f for us to cook our thinly sliced beef on.  the waiter demonstrated by taking some butter and spreading it on top of the stone followed by laying the beef on top like it's sunbathing.  after a minute or two, the beef slices were dipped onto 1 of 3 sauces and finally onto our table.  the verdict: mouth watering bliss.  almost as good as the kobe beef i had in kobe, japan!!!\n\nthe last attraction is the birthday dessert given to my brother.  the candles were sparkling similar to the morning glory fireworks that kids hold in their hands.  truly a memorable experience.", 
            "on the saturday of my bachelorette party, my girlfriends treated me to dinner at sushi samba.  it was a fabulous, memorable meal, where we ate well and celebrated in style.\n\nwe were staying at the palazzo, and sushi samba was the perfect venue for the occasion.  it was convenient to get to in heels, and the atmosphere was festive, edging on clubby without being obnoxious.  we had a big comfortable table, and service was excellent.  i wish we'd gotten the name of our waiter - he did a great job attending to our every need, and he guided us through the whole dining experience with expertise.  (for management - he was a tall guy who served a party of nine on 6/29.  you know, your only bachelorette party of the month?)\n\nwe ordered cocktails, which were pretty good.  i had a blame it on rio, a caipirinha variation with cacha\\u00e7a, agave syrup, fresh lime juice, cucumber, and jalape\\u00f1o.  it was both cool and spicy, and it went down really easy.  the classic caipirinha was also great, with just the cacha\\u00e7a, lime, and sugar.  i also tried some of the chu-cumber, a shochu drink with hendricks gin, elderflower liqueur, and muddled cucumber - very refreshing.  at some point, we got a complimentary cocktail tree, a beautiful iron tree bearing shot-sized wine glasses on every branch.  they held some frothy, sweet version of a screwdriver that was great for the occasion.\n\ndinner was delicious.  we had the option of ordering a la carte or omakase, and we decided to keep things simple.  we specified a price point and listed dietary restrictions, and the food just started coming.  it was all served family style, and everything was well portioned for our big group.  we left full but not overstuffed - a plus, since it had taken a team to stuff me into my white dress for the night.  the cuisine was fun, a creative, unforced fusion of japanese and peruvian styles.\n\nfirst, we had a trio of vegetable otsumami, all served together in a lovely green array.  there was the staple edamame with sea salt and lime, and <mark>Green Bean Tempura</mark> served with a rich black truffle aioli.  my favorite of the three, though, was the handful of shishito peppers.  these were grilled blistering black, polished with sea salt and lemon.  they were pretty irresistible.  next we got a tray of japanese a5 <mark>Seared W<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> Beef</mark> gyoza.  these were great, thin-skinned and stuffed with luscious hunks of beef rather than the usual mince.  they came with kabocha pumpkin pur\\u00e9e, a sweet soy drizzle, and a su-shoyu dipping sauce.  the best thing i ate all night, though, was a crispy taquito overflowing with yelllowtail, avocado, and roasted corn miso.  the shell was thin and crunchy, and the fresh, tender fish was just right with that avocado, miso, and some thinly sliced vegetables.  the taquitos were served with spicy aji panca sauce and fresh lime - that piquant, frothy sauce was just the icing on a beautiful fusion taco cake.\n\nafter the smaller plates were done, we moved on to big platters of sushi and sashimi.  i do not remember everything we got, as there were at least six or seven rolls and even more kinds of sashimi.  the rolls were great, a nice mix of california standards - you know, the mix and match of eel, yellowtail, tuna, etc. with avocado, cucumber, and dots of mayo - and more samba-specific stuff, with the stray <mark><mark>Alaskan King Crab</mark> Leg</mark> and lobster claw.  i particularly liked the <mark>Samba Strip</mark>, with <mark>Half Maine Lobster</mark> tempura, mango, tomato, chive, soy paper, and a coating of crispy rice.  it was unusual and flavorful, served with a peanut curry.  the rest of the platter came with a sweet thick soy sauce and a bit of mayo.  the sashimi was more traditional, served on a bed of ice.  it was hard to share, as there was only one of each kind, but the slivers i had were great.\n\nthe most filling part of the meal was the churrasco course.  we got two hefty platters of the <mark>Rio Grande</mark> with three meats, grilled hanger steak, ribeye, and chorizo.  these were great, juicy and tender and full of that hearty grilled meat flavor.  they came with a trio of dipping sauces - malagueta pepper oil, chimichurri, and a third that is infuriatingly absent from the menu.  we also had some sides of rice, beans, collard greens, and a medley of <mark>Roasted Seasonal Vegetables</mark> - giant corn kernels, toothsome brussels sprouts, carrots, celery, pearl onions, and more.  we also got miso-marinated chilean <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> a la carte, with roasted organic vegetables and oshinko.  this was a winner - the fish was moist, flakey, and shot through with miso flavor.\n\nwe were full by dessert, but loved the complimentary chocolate mousse, served with a sparkler and a congratulatory message.  the lush mousse came topped with crunchy chocolate pearls, whipped cream, and a little bit of candle-stuck banana.  we each got a sweet bite to end our wonderful dinner.\n\nin conclusion, my friends are the best - thank you girls for this weekend, and for this fun, delicious meal.  sushi samba was an a+ choice, worthy of a night i won't soon forget.",

            "we came to sushisamba for my birthday dinner a few days ago and i was blown away by the food! it definitely exceeded expectations.\n\nthe menu was so overwhelming we didn't know where to even begin and while our waiter didn't really help us narrow things down, he did make some good suggestions and helped us pace out the meal so we can order as we go. he came with the manager, who was very nice and gave us birthday shots, and also asked that we let him know if he could do anything. \n\nhere's what we started with: shishito peppers combo (grilled shishito peppers, tempura string beans with a truffle aioli, and edamame), <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark> in a spicy mayo sauce, <mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark>, and <mark>Crispy Hokkaido Scallop</mark> lettuce wraps. the peppers were a good surprise of the night because i didn't expect it to come with the string beans and edamame, but i definitely appreciated the greens in vegas! the <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark> was really tasty, but i wish it was a little crunchier when it came out. they tasted a bit soggy as if they were sitting in sauce for too long, but no complaints because the flavor was still there. the <mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> was good, but nothing really mind-blowing in my opinion. the <mark>Crispy Hokkaido Scallop</mark> lettuce wrap was phenomenal. our waiter said it was a new item on the menu and suggested we try it and it really blew us all out of the water. \n\nwe followed up the first round with the robata - we got the <mark>Berkshire Pork Belly</mark>, rib eye, <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>, and duck. all of them were so good, so make sure you pay a visit to the robata section when you visit! the duck and the rib eye to me stood out more than the others - they were cooked very well and had a good mix of <mark>Uni</mark> flavors.\n\nwe finished off dessert with their 4th of july special (red velvet cheesecake, frozen blueberries, and white chocolate ice cream) and sadly we were underwhelmed with what came out. i think we were so blown away by the entire meal, we felt like dessert was going to continue the streak, but were left wanting a bit more. either way, we were so stuffed it didn't matter and the dessert didn't take away from how much we liked the meal itself.\n\nwhat really set this over the edge is that the chef came out to shake our hands and chat with us really quickly, which i really appreciated! the service was great, the recommendations were on par, and the food was delicious. i would definitely recommend this spot for a special occasion - go ahead and gorge!!", 
            "this restaurant gets very high marks.\n\nlet's talk about the food- everything on the menu is delicious. the different ethnic combinations is what sets this place apart. the flavor the variety, and a must chilean <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> skewers.\n\nthe service- always smiling very friendly. the management comes over to give our party a complimentary app for being returned guests. they really know how to make you feel welcome and special. everyone from the manager, bar tenders, greeters, servers, and bussing staff conduct themselves in a highly professional manner.\n\nif you are in vegas you have to stop here, try and do small plates and try all different things on this wonderful menu.\n\nthis is the kind of restaurant where you would say to yourself aft spending a few hundred on a nice meal it was worth it.", 
            "my dining experience fell short of my expectations considering what we ate (or shall i say what we didn't eat) compared to what we paid. there were 21 of us for dinner and we had the chef's selection, also known as omakase. typically, you would get the most innovative dishes ordering this style.  however, we were served typical menu items.  i think it was just a strategic way for them to serve a larger group without having to cater to individual orders. \n\nthe good was that most of the items we tasted were pretty good. the bad was that we weren't given enough food to taste everything, even though we were all charged the same price.  \n\ninstead, we shared each plate of food between 5-7 people, which included the following: \n(1) <mark>Tuna Tataki</mark>: only got to try it because someone didn't eat raw fish. \n(2) <mark>Seared W<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> Beef</mark> dumplings: not enough brought out so i never got to try it. \n(3) mini yellow tail tacos:  i liked the spicy foam which added a nice kick to the citrus-ey flavors of the dish. \n(4) crab tempura: how ridiculous is it that there were only several pieces to each order so the hubs and i had to share one bite of one piece? this wouldn't even qualify as an amuse-bouche. \n(5) <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> and shrimp skewers: again, not enough so most of us shared skewers. \n(6) steak and mushroom stew: everyone got 1-2 thin slices of beef, which was tender and flavorful. \n(7) sushi rolls/sashimi: the sushi rolls were the most generous items served (about 5 cut rolls) but imo were rather underwhelming. the sashimi, on the other hand, was delicious and fresh. we were given about 3 slices each of yellowtail, tuna, and salmon which i easily could have eaten by myself.\n\ni felt bad for the hubs because he was still hungry and asked what was being served next, only to be told that it was just dessert followed by a $2500 bill ($240 per couple). \n\nyes, our server was pleasant and friendly. yes, the food was quite tasty.  and, yes, they need to recalculate the amount of food for groups ordering from the chef's selection. sure, i expected to pay a lot for this kind of meal, but what i didn't expect was to leave unsatisfied and wanting for more.", 
            "the best sushi ever!!  make sure to order the <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> and gyoza!! \n\nour waiter was very nice.  really liked their service and ambience.  happy hour is sunday-friday 4-7pm and 11pm-close.  you can't go wrong with their happy hour menu selections and prices.  \n\nyou must dine here when in vegas.  you won't be disappointed!",

            "celebrated a friend's 40th bday here.  service was good and the hosts friendly.  we were asked how much we wanted to spend, and we said about $50 pp (with tax and drinks, though, it came to be over $90 for those who ordered drinks and $80 for those who didn't).  they do their best to keep under or at your budget - and they did!  it's kinda cool bc they will add an extra piece of two depending on the size of your party and prorate the piece.  no more having to cut pieces because there's only four items and six people.\n\nhowever, i thought it was lame that i told them i was allergic to shrimp and they still brought out a dish with shrimp!  they asked what allergies we had, so i would assume when they do that, they will try to avoid bringing out anything with those items.  what's the point in asking what your allergies are if you don't adhere to them??  i should have asked to return it or taken off the bill - according to an email exchange with someone when reserving a table, it said we could return any dish we didn't enjoy.  the dish was good, but again, don't serve things people are allergic to after being told.\n\nanyway, most of the food was good, though there were a few misses.  we started with some tempura fried green beans and edamame - something we probably wouldn't have normally ordered since it seemed like filler food.  we all loved the scallop wrapped in what looked like a fried bird's nest.  so good.  the waguy dumplings were good but something we could have skipped.  also, another favorite was the <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> and <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark> - omg that was so delicious.  i could have eaten way more of that plate.  the <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark> kernels were really large and sweet.  the tuna tacos were another favorite.  we didn't like the beef and mushroom pot so much - had a strong coconut flavor, which i'm not a fan of.  we also got a plate of sushi, three different kinds.  one was good, but the rest were okay.  the banana boat dessert, though nice, wasn't that good.  we probably would have skipped it.  it was basically pieces of banana with torched sugar on top and ice cream, etc.  \n\ndrinks are expensive but really good here.  i recommend ordering the samba one was way better than mine, and in a really large glass!  it was fruity and fresh, and there was definitely alcohol in it.  i might go back one day if i win some money, but i'll prob stick to ordering the dishes myself.\n\noverall, the food was pretty good, but the price is pretty expensive for what you get.  i had expected a little more, i guess.", 
            "co-workers and i went for sushi one evening after work, and it was the best sushi i've ever had- an incredible experience. the service was outstanding, the food was a great mix of <mark><mark>Osetra Caviar Imperial 20g</mark> 20g</mark> <mark>Uni</mark> asian fusion. i recommend the <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>- the best i've ever had!", 
            "one of the many reasons i love the palazzo is the creepy-when-you-think-about-it facts that you can have a week long vacay and never really go outside. one of the other reasons i like the joint is... sushisamba. \n\nall fusion isn't created equal and most of what's deemed fusion in the multi-billion dollar tourist traps still doesn't cut it as top notch cuisine... but in three rotations over the years, the one thing i can say is that they've consistently delivered a good experience.  and that's more than i can say for a few others that are no longer at the palazzo.   it's also consistently noisy... do with that what you will. \n\nfavorites from the menu... <mark>Moqueca Mista</mark> (kinda hard to mess up fish stew with good ingredients ) and the <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> are my favorites of the full entries, which i wouldn't recommend on a first visit.  save big plates for your second or third go round.  almost anything with the w<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> is a hit; i think sushisamba drives the south american flavors home using fine japanese beef.  but if it works... \n\nthe yamato roll... epic as it is... to me, is **almost** overkill.  super indulgent <mark>Foie Gras</mark> and w<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> are almost a taste bud assault.   but at the same time, you have to try it-share it. the sa\\u00f5 paulo and the <mark>Neo Tokyo</mark> are my favorites here.   the <mark>Samba Strip</mark> is also pretty awesome.  again, pile enough good things together and see what happens. \n\nthe so so and not so on the menu... if anything ... rock shrimp (discontinued) and tiger <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark>.   mojitos are so so...( to me) as well.   the robata squid was literally hit and miss; had it once and it was great... and the next time... just rubber. \n\nall in all, come here with good company, a serious appetite and charge it to the room...i prefer early lunch or just after midnight.", 
            "jason, you are the man! thank you for making both this time and last time an incredible experience.\n\nreturned a month or so later, eager to try it out again next time i came back to vegas.\n\ni think this round somehow exceeding my experience last time. i got a lot of the same dishes, as well as tried out a few new ones and i was not dissapointed.\n\nour waitress was incredible and service was quick and enjoyable...even the parties next to us had a great time and sparked great conversation. the ambiance is hip and sexy while still being inviting and enjoyable.\n\nin addition to last time, we got the chuchumber cocktail which wasn't too sweet but amazingly refreshing. we also got the phyllo-wrapped scallop which at first i assumed would take away from the taste of the scallop but instead the combination of textures was just awesome. \n\nwe wanted to try one of the peruvian ceviches, so we went with the ginger/soy yellowfin one, which was pretty tasty but not quite up on the same level when it comes to crazy flavor profiles. \n\nthe other new dish we got was the <mark>Samba Strip</mark> roll. as somewhat of a sushi afficianado, i was excited to try it but not expecting a whole lot. crazy enough the lobster and mango combination with the peanut curry sauce was really crazy good. the roll also was made with some crispy rice and served with a meaty lobster claw so it was a solid choice. \n\nthe <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>, sashimi, and little kobe taquitos were just as good as i remembered them and was not let down.\n\nthank you to everyone at sushi samba for making it such a great second experience. i've already sent a number of friends over and i will definitely continue recommending more your way.", 
            "i'm always a little skeptical of asian fusion cuisine, but this place does it right! our waitress was very helpful in guiding us through the menu, pointing out the more popular items. it is a \"tapas\" style menu, the plates are small and meant to be shared! we ordered: \n\n-<mark>Seared W<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> Beef</mark> gyoza: i think this was the best thing we ordered! the beef was soooo good and i loved the sauces on the side. \n\n-<mark>Berkshire Pork Belly</mark> ramen: everything in the ramen was very traditional, but the broth was very different from your typical bowl. it had a hint of lemongrass and some heat, which my boyfriend and i really liked (it kind of reminded us of tom yum soup). \n\n-<mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> and shrimp skewers: both came with a side of <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark>! so yummy! these are supposedly the two most popular of the anticuchos. \n\n-lima roll: a pretty standard <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark> roll. i would have rather tried another one of their small plates or tempura instead. \n\nbetween two people this was more than enough food. overall, a really great and satisfying meal with <mark>Uni</mark> flavors!",

            "our server suggested to us that we simply trust him and he would put together a three course meal for us. we were on the fence as while he stated he could keep it to $50pp we were just looking for a good and inexpensive sushi dinner. well, thank god we trusted him! when the food came out the price seemed like a bargain. every course was about 3-5 things to share. the <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> and the gyoza were stand outs but literally everything was amazing. the cocktails were top notch. i paid the same price here for an amazing drink complete with a sugar cane and a banana leaf for the same price as a well drink most places on the strip. i would highly recommend this!", 
            "i came to this restaurant about a year ago for work related function.  at that time, my experience was very good, so i wanted to take my husband with me this time for him to experience the same.\n\nwhen we got there, the hostess set us at a table and asked us to move again because they had a reservation for party of 4, so they had to sit them there.  there were other tables with 4 people seats available, but we agreed to move.\n\nwhen i was here last time, the waiter was very nice and friendly and he had a good knowledge of the menu, especially the tasting menu options.  however, this time, we did not like our waitress.  when i decided to go there, i had tasting menu in my mind and i asked her to give me more explanations on that as i wasn't the one to order last time.   i am not sure if she was new to this place or not, but she seemed like she had no idea what the tasting menu entails or she didn't want to sell it.  she basically said that there are 3 courses and they can customize it if we had any preferences or allergies.  however, she did not say anything about what kind of foods will be on the tasting menu, whether they are from the regular menu vs off the menu items and even what kind of foods we will be served.  when i asked for difference between different tasting menu options, she basically said the quality of meat and fish are different.  everything she said was very vague.  \n\nalthough we still didn't really get much info that we wanted, since my experience last time was pretty good, we decided to do the tasting menu with the waygu hot stone bbq thing.  the few items that we got were tasty.  we liked w<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> dumpling and chilean <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> with corns.  their  ceviche taco thing was okay and we were not a big fan of the tuna appetizer that they brought out.  we got the w<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> bbq which i think is good to try it as a experience as the meat was tasty and it is a <mark>Uni</mark> experience but i am not too sure if it is worth it to pay $128 for 4 oz w<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> to grill it on a hot stone.  \n\nafter trying their tuna dish, we realized that we can have sushi in la too, so we asked the waitress to suggest something <mark>Uni</mark> to the restaurant rather than sushi or rolls which we can get other places for part of tasting menu as she said she can customize it for us. however, she couldn't really give us any suggestions or tell us how they can customize for us.  by then, we were not happy about the service and some of the foods that we tried, so we decided to cancel the tasting menu and pay for whatever we ate and left early.  \n\nmaybe my expectation was high for this place but i am really disappointed on their waitress' knowledge on their menu and some of the foods.  it was a very special night for us, so i really wanted it to be special but i have to say that dining at sushi samba definitely was not the highlight of our evening, rather more of a disappointment of the evening.  i saw every food item that we were served on the regular menu, so maybe it is better to stick with ordering off the menu rather than tasting menu and skip the w<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> hot stone bbq.  i won't be going back to this place in the future.\n\nfoods: 2.5 stars\natmosphere: 3 stars\nservice: 0 star\noverall experience: 1 star", 
            "i recently had one of the best meals of my life at sushisamba. i was visiting vegas on my own and decided to treat myself to a dinner at this restaurant that i used to love in chicago, before it shut down (sadly). it had been so long that i really got to try a lot of new things on the menu and i was in love with all of them.  i started out with a glass of sparkling rose because i'm classy like that. managers michael and jeremy gave me a primo spot to sip my bubbles and watch the fabulous crowd pour in for the dinner service. they also handed me a beautiful taster of their cucumber cocktail, which was fantastic. \n\nnext jeremy brought me over one of the yellow tail taquitos, which had a crisp shell and a flavorful foam to spoon on top. it was a great amuse bouche. along with that, i ordered the <mark>Seared W<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> Beef</mark> gyoza. the beef just melted in your mouth. it was so good. i tried to slow myself down to savor every bite of the tender meat in the dumplings. the sauce that came with them was also an integral part of their savory goodness. i think i could eat those dumplings every day until the day i die and still ask for them in heaven (or hell, depending on where i end up). \n\nthe next dish i ordered was the yamato sushi, which sounded like the absolute most decadent sushi roll i could ever possibly order. and it was. and i loved it. starting with white sushi rice, topped with flavorful fresh tuna, the smallest most perfect piece of <mark>Foie Gras</mark>, a dot of caviar, and topped with gold flake. i mean come on. i felt like the queen of sheba! each bite was a beautiful rich, even slightly sweet (from the sauce) morsel. it felt light and sinful at the same time.\n\nthen, michael stopped by to check on me and suggested i order the <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> robata. two skewers of meaty <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> grilled with a delicious miso sauce. they were the perfect bite to pair with the giant <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark> kernels served on the side. and i ordered mashed purple potatoes to top off the meal. everything was cooked to perfection. i just felt so grateful and happy to be there.\n\nwhen it came time for dessert, i was so full that all i wanted was coffee. so i ordered an espresso with a single scoop of chocolate ice cream, which was a great finish to an amazing meal. then michael and jeremy brought me one more surprise: an ice cream pop. mango ice cream covered with a white chocolate shell and graham cracker.\n\neverything was just awesome. michael and jeremy did a great job, as did my server, also named michael. amazing dinner in a really fun city. beautiful decor. they really made me feel right at home!",

            "i've stayed at the venetian/palazzo a dozen times and had never eaten at sushi samba. what a terrible mistake i've made all these years. looking for a restaurant in the hotel for our bachelor party, we decided upon sushisamba due to the variety of dishes, the vibrant atmosphere, and positive word of mouth reviews. we made a reservation through opentable, and were promptly seated upon arrival.\n\nsamba proclaims to have the most extensive sake selection in vegas, and we let our server choose a cheaper bottle for us and it was delicious. \n\n1) japanese a5 <mark>Seared W<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> Beef</mark> gyoza (4.5/5) - you get 5 delicious pot stickers with quality beef that just melts in your mouth\n\n2) yellowtail taquito (5/5) - there are two mandatory dishes to get and this is one of them. essentially a mini taco with yellowtail, roasted corn miso, and avocado. the explosion of flavor was mind-numbingly good and even friends who don't enjoy seafood loved this\n\n3) yellowtail sashimi (4.5/5) - 4 slices of high quality yellowtail, the sauce is delicate and sour\n\n4)  <mark>Berkshire Pork Belly</mark> (3.75/5) - i am admittedly biased towards <mark>Berkshire Pork Belly</mark> so i loved the dish. the butterscotch miso on top was a little overwhelming but the <mark>Berkshire Pork Belly</mark> itself was cooked to perfection\n\n5) <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> anticucho (5/5) - this is the other mandatory dish. we were very for<mark>Tuna</mark> because the table next to us came 15 minutes after and they ran out of this dish! the <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> skewer is  their signature dish and deservedly so. two skewers of <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> cooked so perfectly (soft on inside, slightly crispy exterior), there aren't enough superlatives to describe how delicious it is. \n\n6) <mark>Rio Grande</mark> (4/5) - from their churrasco menu, includes three types of meat: ribeye, chorizo, and w<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> picanha. i would not suggest this if you are eating by yourself or with another because it is just so much meat. in a larger group setting, i think this dish is perfect to share. the w<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> picanha is my favorite because the meat was so soft and tender.\n\nquite simply, i loved my experience at sushisamba. the service was fantastic. the food was <mark>Uni</mark> and delicious at the same time. the atmosphere embodies that of vegas- vibrant and exciting. the price of the dinner was what i'd expect from a \"strip\" restaurant, so be prepared to spend at least $50. \n\ni can't wait to go back to sushisamba for some yellowtail tacos and <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>.",

            "date/time:  monday - 10pm\noccasion:  vegasaversary dinner after phantom \nparty of:  two\nlocation:  amongst the shoppes in palazzo.  interesting decor.  dark ambiance.\nordered:  roasted shishito peppers, hamachi tiradito, miso-glazed <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> skewers, <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> roll, <mark>Moqueca Mista</mark>, and trio of sorbet/ice cream (green tea, lychee, and vanilla)\ntotal incl gratuity: ~$110\n\ni am so stunned that sushi samba (ss) has an overall rating of 3.5!  it definitely deserved a 5 in my book.  was pretty blown away by all of their food.  i'm not usually that impressed with asian fusion but they deserve two thumbs up.  we arrived at 10pm and i was expecting it to be rather dead but it was still busy and happening.  all tables occupied, loud music bumping, and servers running around.\n\nthe bf and i decided on a few dishes to share.  everything on the menu ranged between $10 - $30.  granted we ordered a number of different items - for variety and sufficiency - we figured our dinner bill would be a little pricey.  seeing shisito peppers on the menu, i had to go for it.  i don't know what it is about these little things but i love them.  ss serves them grilled with a splash of lemon and seasalt.  a very good and light starter.  it actually went really well with the lemongrass sauce that was served with the hamachi tiradito.  don't even get me started on that lemongrass sauce. o.m.gee. i'm pretty sure there was a hint of crack in that thing because i was drinking that stuff.  it was so incredibly delicious.  when the waitress tried to take my plate away, she noticed how much i was savoring each drip of it so she brought me out a ramekin of it.  naturally i was dipping everything in that sauce.\n\nthe <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> skewers were just as delectable - melted in my mouth with the perfect flavor of miso.  highly recommend!  we noticed our neighbor ordered the <mark>Moqueca Mista</mark>. it looked delicious and we opted for it as well.  it was the perfect entree.  i couldn't have been more pleased.  the seafood was fresh and generous in portion.  the coconut lime flavor was delicious.\n\nseriously, ss is fantastic  i can't emphasize it enough.  since i've been back home, i've been telling everyone about this place. no joke!  one can only hope that they'll open one in sf.  i'm headed back to vegas in a week - making my way back there for sure!", 
            "<mark>Moqueca Mista</mark> (all the waiters/waitresses will say that is their fave lol) & the salmon are my go-to's. of course, you have to try the asparagus with the truffle aioli as an appetizer. we are regulars here, and as regulars, the chef likes to treat you with special meals! this time we had kobe beef tacos (i am pescetrian, so it was nice to look at, haha) as our meal. i also love their rolls, such as the carnival roll. the red miso is also great, i love truffle, but it was a little too salty (truffle oil). the desserts are to die for, such as the mini doughnuts in the hazelnut sauce and the funky banana dish. and, best of all... it's a stones throw from barney's!!! you can shop while you wait for your food! but, its not like the food takes very long anyway :)", 
            "i'm biased. i love sushi, and my brazilian blood will never let me forget the exotic tastes and textures of northern-brazilian cuisine. so here you have sushi+samba... what in heavens can go wrong? culinary orgasm for sure. i booked a table for 4, but my buddies stood me up, so i went alone.a super friendly and beautiful asian-american young lady took me to the sushi bar, and in a matter of seconds an even more beautiful mixed-asian waitress showed up. if the food is any good this place is paradise! anyway, i had to go exotic, so i ordered two appetizers (carnaval= shrimp, avocado, yellowtail tartar, crispy rice paper and the <mark>Samba Strip</mark> = <mark>Half Maine Lobster</mark>, mango, tomato, chive, crispy rice, soy paper, peanut curry) and a \"half\" main dish (<mark>Moqueca Mista</mark> = shrimp, squid, <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> and crayfish with coconut milk, roasted cashew, dend\\u00ea oil, chimichurri rice ... this is a very typical brazilian dish)\n\nthe moment i started savoring the spices, the seafood, the dende oil... i was taken back to bahia, incredible beaches, sea-breeze, mulatas in tiny bikinis... i had to snap back in order to continue my sensory trip to food nirvana.\n\nbefore they rate my review xxx and ban it from yelp, i will summarize: just go, order without fear, enjoy the smells and tastes (and the view), go exotic, try \"positions\" you never dared before.\n\nlook, once you go \"sushi+brazil\" you never go back.\n\ncheers!", 
            "i cant believe i forgot to tell everyone just how much we liked  sushisamba..  it was a seafood and sushi lovers delight.   we've eaten sushi all over the world,  but sushisamba really stays in our minds.  i can still see my <mark>Seaweed Salad</mark>,  (so good),  and those <mark>Rainbow Dragon</mark> samba rolls,  that we devoured before our main course,  a plate so large,  we split it two ways!   it think it was called  <mark>Moqueca Mista</mark>,  something like that,  that included shrimp,  squid,  <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>,  to die for!   it has been a couple months and i can still taste that seafood,  prepared perfectly....  the atmosphere was nice,  so was my company.   we had a great meal,  we definitly will make  sushisamba our first stop on our next trip to vegas!   worth every dime!!!!", 
            "great fusion restaurant with a nice mix of small plates and interesting entrees. my favorite dish is the \"<mark>Moqueca Mista</mark>\" - a rice dish covered in a ton of seafood \"curry\". the flavor of the sauce is perfect and not overly sweet or coconut-flavored. \n\nwe also tried:\n1. crispy yellowtail taquitos - so good and perfectly crispy \n2. ceviche +tiradito combo of 4 - nothing special\n3. <mark>Berkshire Pork Belly</mark> robata - a little too sweet with the butterscotch miso \n4. <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> robata - also a bit too sweet\n5. salt + <mark>Salt and Pepper Squid</mark> - yum, this was fried with a lot of flavor\n6. <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark> - a bit too much mayo-sauce for my taste\n\noverall this was our second visit and if you order just the right things (i would stick with the fried appetizers and <mark>Moqueca Mista</mark>) then it's a great meal. it's pricey - but hey, it's vegas so i'm not really factoring that into my review. i would definitely go back again!",

            "in las vegas as well as other big restaurant/entertainment towns, good food is expected but in las vegas it sometimes does not fully compare to chicago and ny.\n\nhowever, the one place i finally went to was sushi samba and what a great surprise.  i tend to avoid sushi in several places when traveling unless in hawaii and some parts of ca and japan.  sushi samba had some of the best dishes i have had and the quality was great.  they have a variety of menu items with small plates and full entrees.  they do some <mark><mark>Osetra Caviar Imperial 20g</mark> 20g</mark> but mostly more interesting variations as well as the s american dishes.  some of the items were:\nrock fish\n<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark>\n<mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark>\n<mark>Green Bean Tempura</mark>\n<mark>Berkshire Pork Belly</mark>\n<mark>Moqueca Mista</mark>. seafood coconut milk and rice with green onion\nyamato sushi roll(maguro, fois gras, <mark><mark>Osetra Caviar Imperial 20g</mark> 20g</mark>)\nuni shushi outstanding \ngreat sake list\n\nall the fish and shellfish were fresh and well prepared.\n\nit gets busy so we ate at the bar and the service was excellent there.  luna and maria can help with picking some great dishes at the bar.\n\nit is on the higher price side but worth it compared to a lot of other places where the food doesn't always live up to the expectations in vegas.  looking forward to next trip back there.", 
            "i always enjoy sushi samba.  it's a great mix of brazilian and japanese.  some concepts work better than others but even the basic stuff is done right.  salmon sushi - that's how i know if a place does sushi well - is great here.  i also loved some of the creative dishes - the yellowtail sashimi with jalapeno and lemongrass was wonderful.   but the killer dish to get - the <mark>Moqueca Mista</mark>!  shrimp, <mark>Scallop</mark>, mussels in a coconut broth with chimichurri rice!!!  heaven!\n\nonly real issue are their prices.  if you are prepared for the prices, it's worth a trip.", 
            "love, love, love this place. flawless service, excellent food, and the dj-rocking atmosphere put sushisamba at the top of my list for great las vegas dining. at first, i was skeptical. japanese, brazilian, and peruvian dishes? and they all work together? the answer is yes, indeed they do.\n\nif you're lucky enough to get jimmy as your server, do follow his recommendations. his were spot on, plus he took excellent care of our table all evening. jimmy suggested we give him a price point per diner, and then he delivered a sumptuous multi-course meal, taking us on a culinary trip to all three countries in under two hours. oh, and did i mention i have a food allergy? sushisamba didn't even blink. after my celiac diagnosis three years ago, i thought i had to give up \"chef's choice\" or prix fixe meals. not here. while most of our courses were gf, when they weren't the kitchen prepared gf versions especially for me, and i didn't have to agonize over my choices or worry about my safety. sushisamba took care of everything.\n\nand what dishes they were! start off with a caipirinha, the signature drink of brazil, and then let your server delight your senses. a few of the highlights: the <mark>Tuna Tataki</mark>; yellowtail taquitos; miso-marinated <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>; and the <mark>Moqueca Mista</mark>. the <mark>Moqueca Mista</mark> was the crowd-pleaser of the evening, a beautiful seafood dish with the tastiest chimichurri rice i've ever had. but the star of the evening was the sushi. served as the final courses, we had two huge platters - one gf, one not - and wow, did they deliver. hope to make it back here for another fine meal. viva las vegas!", 
            "one of the many reasons i love the palazzo is the creepy-when-you-think-about-it facts that you can have a week long vacay and never really go outside. one of the other reasons i like the joint is... sushisamba. \n\nall fusion isn't created equal and most of what's deemed fusion in the multi-billion dollar tourist traps still doesn't cut it as top notch cuisine... but in three rotations over the years, the one thing i can say is that they've consistently delivered a good experience.  and that's more than i can say for a few others that are no longer at the palazzo.   it's also consistently noisy... do with that what you will. \n\nfavorites from the menu... <mark>Moqueca Mista</mark> (kinda hard to mess up fish stew with good ingredients ) and the <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> are my favorites of the full entries, which i wouldn't recommend on a first visit.  save big plates for your second or third go round.  almost anything with the w<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> is a hit; i think sushisamba drives the south american flavors home using fine japanese beef.  but if it works... \n\nthe yamato roll... epic as it is... to me, is **almost** overkill.  super indulgent <mark>Foie Gras</mark> and w<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> are almost a taste bud assault.   but at the same time, you have to try it-share it. the sa\\u00f5 paulo and the <mark>Neo Tokyo</mark> are my favorites here.   the <mark>Samba Strip</mark> is also pretty awesome.  again, pile enough good things together and see what happens. \n\nthe so so and not so on the menu... if anything ... rock shrimp (discontinued) and tiger <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark>.   mojitos are so so...( to me) as well.   the robata squid was literally hit and miss; had it once and it was great... and the next time... just rubber. \n\nall in all, come here with good company, a serious appetite and charge it to the room...i prefer early lunch or just after midnight.",

            "i made dinner reservations for a wednesday night during a work convention at the venetian. i arrived first and waited at the bar and got a moscow mule. it's a circular bar that is half inside and half outside the restaurant so it's great when you're waiting for your party to arrive.\n\nwe were seated inside and the ambiance is really lively. it was pretty dark inside but they were really busy for a wednesday night ( but that could be because our entire company pretty much took over the hotel that week). our waiter took out drink, we got the lemon samurai which was really good. i think it had vodka and some citrus notes in it, also a little strong but that's a good thing right? :) \n\nour waiter returned and gave us a thorough breakdown of all the options we had. basically you can order what you want or you can have the chef whip up a meal for you based on your likes and dislikes. we decided to order a bunch of different dishes (they're tapas style btw). \n\nwe started with the otsumami (edamame, tempura green beans, and grilled shishito peppers) which was really good. i liked the tempura green beans (could be cause it's fried lol). we also got the crispy taquitos, salmon ceviche, yellow sashimi tiradito, the <mark>12 Oz Ribeye Tobanyaki</mark>, and the sao paolo roll. most of this was recommended by our waiter and other recommendations we received.\n\neverything came out really quickly actually. and everything was delicious. the taquitos were super good the only thing about them was the shell was really flimsy and practically broke apart when you picked them up. the salmon ceviche was really good and had a nice kick from the jalape\\u00f1os. we had some colleagues that said we had to get the yellow tail tiradito and it was really good! it actually tasted like a dorito lol but i would definitely say to order one of the tiradito dishes. the only hot plate was the <mark>12 Oz Ribeye Tobanyaki</mark> which the table next to us got so we decided to try it and the beef was super tender. \n\nthe service was really great, our waiter was very tentative and knowledgable. my colleague had to ask us what he said after he was done talking because she thought he was so cute lol.\n\nall in all i would definitely come back. i had a great time from the food to the service and right down to the ambiance - my entire experience was memorable. i recommend coming here if you like japanese food with a twist!"

            "excellent service from matt who was very knowledgeable of the foreign terms on the menu and made the atmosphere more lively.  he was very patient with the dietary restrictions that my friend had and made great recommendations.  \n\nhighlights were the <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark> which were colossal and meaty.  they disappeared very quickly.  we also shared the <mark>Rio Grande</mark> churrasco.  one of the 3 meats we had chosen were the rib eye which was medium rare and excellent with the red chimichurri dipping sauce (1 of the 4 sauces that came with the dish).  the lobster on the <mark>Samba Strip</mark> roll was the best thing of the dish - everything else was a bit plain and for $20, i don't think i'll be ordering that again. we also had the tasty <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> skewers and topped our dinner off with 3 flavors of ice cream on a plate with a chocolate 'happy birthday' written on it for the birthday girls. the place is a bit pricey but heck, we were in vegas!",

            "bachelorette party of 12 girls. i called to make reservations and they informed me on the phone that with a large party of our size, we would need to do a set menu. they said that the waiter would work with us on the day of to put together a menu to work around any restrictions we had. \n\nwe were running a little late (you can imagine how that can happen with1 2 girls) so i called to let them know and they were very nice and accommodating. they said not to worry and that they would hold our table for us. we arrived at the restaurant and were seated at a big table in the back of the restaurant (the restaurant is pretty big). the table itself was huge and we had plenty of space between the 12 of us.\n\nso, between the group of 12, we had the following restrictions: one pregnancy, allergies to peanuts, shrimp, and shellfish. the waiter asked us what amount we wanted to keep it to and we told him to keep it around $50/person. we ended up with the following:\n\n+otsumami assortment of edamame, <mark>Green Bean Tempura</mark>, shishito - all delicious. the dipping sauce had truffle in it... who doesn't love truffles??\n+berkshire pork gyoza - pretty good gyoza. wasn't a big fan of the pumpkin dipping sauce..\n+yellowtail taquitos - delicious! \n+<mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> anticucho and chicken anticucho - the <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> was amazing (as everyone else has already mentioned). it is so buttery and melts in your mouth.\n+a ton of sushi rolls and some sashimi - pretty good... i would say their strength is in more of their cooked food than their sushi and sashimi. i always prefer sashimi over rolls because the rolls are usually too fusiony for me but the other girls loved them\n+<mark>Rio Grande</mark> churrasco - 5 diff meats with 3 diff dipping sauces. very good but so full that we couldn't eat much\n\nservice was great. we informed our waiter that we needed to be out the door by 9:30 pm and he made sure that the food just kept coming. by the end of dinner, we were so stuffed that we couldn't even eat all of the churrasco and had no space for dessert. we even came under budget by a little bit and were all way overly stuffed. \n\nfood was pretty good... but more than anything, it's a fun atmosphere that's good for groups. would definitely go back with a large party.", 
            "this restaurant was really crackin when we came on a sat night for a friend's bday dinner.  you'll definitely need reservations for peak times (ie dinner on a weekend).  it's japanese, brazilian and peruvian cuisine all in one.  if you like japanese w/ a twist, this is the spot to go to.  but beware, for some reason, it was really smokey (prob cause of the brazilian meats they were cooking) and overwhelmed the place (i don't think their blower was working that night).  nonetheless, the restaurant has a hip vibe to it and along with that came much pricier menu options.  we had a large party of 10 and ordered quite a few things from the menu, but i'll just mention the ones that made our group go gaga over:\n\n1) chicken teriyaki ~ samba style <mark>Organic Chicken</mark>, <mark>Purple Potato Mash</mark>, aji amarillo, crispy onion - the chicken was to die for esp with the teriyaki sauce along with the <mark>Purple Potato Mash</mark> (yummm)\n2) <mark>Coconut Rice</mark> - a nice twist to rice and vegetarians\n3) <mark>Rio Grande</mark> w/ a choice of three meats (grilled hanger steak, ribeye, pork tenderloin, chorizo, ling\\u00fci\\u00e7a with malagueta pepper oil and chimichurri) - friends had the hanger steak, ribeye, and i think the pork and came w/ a variety of dipping sauces.  let's just say they were very satisfied.\n\noverall, it's a fun place, but gets a bit crazy and hectic.  large parties are better suited for a booth table vs. something in the middle of the restaurant where we were seated (seemed like we were in the way).  they are also well known for having a large saki menu, although we didn't get to try it out that time.  just more of a reason to come back.", 
            "wonderful!  we had the sashimi/seviche sampler and the churrasco <mark>Rio Grande</mark> (with linguica, brisket and pork).  service was quick, the food was excellent.  we ended up receiving chorizo rather than the linguica with our sampler, the server quickly brought us the linguica in addition.  the sashimi sampler was really the highlight.  complex flavors, but perfectly balances.  a great special night out.  the drinks were great as well.", 
            "i like sushisamba a lot.  it was a fun restaurant with a cool, modern vibe to it.  it is definitely one of the more trendy sushi restaurants that i have been to.  in no way am i putting sushisamba up there with my favorite japanese restaurant, sushi ran in san francisco.  but it was definitely worth trying out.\n\ni didn't try the omakase, but i wanted to.  i was with my wife, who doesn't like anything but meat and vegetable tempura, so i didn't want to be limited.  so we just ordered off the menu, which was fine.  the rolls here are definitely different then i'm used to.  what with all of the <mark>Foie Gras</mark> and <mark>Seared W<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> Beef</mark>.  the <mark>Neo Tokyo</mark> roll was tasty.  i liked the tuna and tempura flakes together.  i also had the hamachi nigiri and the uni nigiri, both of which were very good.  i love uni, and this was good.\n\nwe had the seasonal vegetable tempura, which was good.  to be honest, i've had better tempura but by no means am i saying that this wasn't a good dish.  i like vegetable tempura, so i would order this again.  we also had the the three meat <mark>Rio Grande</mark> churrasco.  we chose the pork tenderloin, the hanger steak and the ribeye.  the hanger steak was by far the best of the three, with the ribeye coming in second.  it was so tasty.  the pork tenderloin was a bit disappointing.  it was dry and uneventful.  next time, i'm getting three orders of the hanger steak.  and the sauces were a nice complement to the dish.\n\nsushisamba is fun.  the food is good.  and the staff is very helpful and knowledgeable.  i had fun here, and i think that adds a lot to your experience at any restaurant.  i can say that i am a fan.", 
            "i started off ordering the otsumami which is an assortment of tempura style vegetables.  wow, this was delicious.  the green bean and the shishito were perfectly fried - enough to keep that \"snap\" to the vegetables that i enjoy - and the mayonnaise based dips were delicious.  a little heat and enough flavor to add a bit to the vegetables.\n\nmy two sisters and i ordered the <mark>Rio Grande</mark> 3 meats.  they were cooked to perfection and even the pork melted in your mouth.  the various dips were great, i liked the vinegar based one, but my sister enjoyed the parsley one (sorry didn't get the name of it).\n\nmy sister also orderd the grilled fish collar.  that was a meal onto itself!  so well cooked.  my niece had the 3 hand roll combo and she loved it. it was wrapped in soy wrap instead of seaweed, so very healthy.\n\noverall a great experience.", 
            "on the saturday of my bachelorette party, my girlfriends treated me to dinner at sushi samba.  it was a fabulous, memorable meal, where we ate well and celebrated in style.\n\nwe were staying at the palazzo, and sushi samba was the perfect venue for the occasion.  it was convenient to get to in heels, and the atmosphere was festive, edging on clubby without being obnoxious.  we had a big comfortable table, and service was excellent.  i wish we'd gotten the name of our waiter - he did a great job attending to our every need, and he guided us through the whole dining experience with expertise.  (for management - he was a tall guy who served a party of nine on 6/29.  you know, your only bachelorette party of the month?)\n\nwe ordered cocktails, which were pretty good.  i had a blame it on rio, a caipirinha variation with cacha\\u00e7a, agave syrup, fresh lime juice, cucumber, and jalape\\u00f1o.  it was both cool and spicy, and it went down really easy.  the classic caipirinha was also great, with just the cacha\\u00e7a, lime, and sugar.  i also tried some of the chu-cumber, a shochu drink with hendricks gin, elderflower liqueur, and muddled cucumber - very refreshing.  at some point, we got a complimentary cocktail tree, a beautiful iron tree bearing shot-sized wine glasses on every branch.  they held some frothy, sweet version of a screwdriver that was great for the occasion.\n\ndinner was delicious.  we had the option of ordering a la carte or omakase, and we decided to keep things simple.  we specified a price point and listed dietary restrictions, and the food just started coming.  it was all served family style, and everything was well portioned for our big group.  we left full but not overstuffed - a plus, since it had taken a team to stuff me into my white dress for the night.  the cuisine was fun, a creative, unforced fusion of japanese and peruvian styles.\n\nfirst, we had a trio of vegetable otsumami, all served together in a lovely green array.  there was the staple edamame with sea salt and lime, and <mark>Green Bean Tempura</mark> served with a rich black truffle aioli.  my favorite of the three, though, was the handful of shishito peppers.  these were grilled blistering black, polished with sea salt and lemon.  they were pretty irresistible.  next we got a tray of japanese a5 <mark>Seared W<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> Beef</mark> gyoza.  these were great, thin-skinned and stuffed with luscious hunks of beef rather than the usual mince.  they came with kabocha pumpkin pur\\u00e9e, a sweet soy drizzle, and a su-shoyu dipping sauce.  the best thing i ate all night, though, was a crispy taquito overflowing with yelllowtail, avocado, and roasted corn miso.  the shell was thin and crunchy, and the fresh, tender fish was just right with that avocado, miso, and some thinly sliced vegetables.  the taquitos were served with spicy aji panca sauce and fresh lime - that piquant, frothy sauce was just the icing on a beautiful fusion taco cake.\n\nafter the smaller plates were done, we moved on to big platters of sushi and sashimi.  i do not remember everything we got, as there were at least six or seven rolls and even more kinds of sashimi.  the rolls were great, a nice mix of california standards - you know, the mix and match of eel, yellowtail, tuna, etc. with avocado, cucumber, and dots of mayo - and more samba-specific stuff, with the stray <mark><mark>Alaskan King Crab</mark> Leg</mark> and lobster claw.  i particularly liked the <mark>Samba Strip</mark>, with <mark>Half Maine Lobster</mark> tempura, mango, tomato, chive, soy paper, and a coating of crispy rice.  it was unusual and flavorful, served with a peanut curry.  the rest of the platter came with a sweet thick soy sauce and a bit of mayo.  the sashimi was more traditional, served on a bed of ice.  it was hard to share, as there was only one of each kind, but the slivers i had were great.\n\nthe most filling part of the meal was the churrasco course.  we got two hefty platters of the <mark>Rio Grande</mark> with three meats, grilled hanger steak, ribeye, and chorizo.  these were great, juicy and tender and full of that hearty grilled meat flavor.  they came with a trio of dipping sauces - malagueta pepper oil, chimichurri, and a third that is infuriatingly absent from the menu.  we also had some sides of rice, beans, collard greens, and a medley of <mark>Roasted Seasonal Vegetables</mark> - giant corn kernels, toothsome brussels sprouts, carrots, celery, pearl onions, and more.  we also got miso-marinated chilean <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> a la carte, with roasted organic vegetables and oshinko.  this was a winner - the fish was moist, flakey, and shot through with miso flavor.\n\nwe were full by dessert, but loved the complimentary chocolate mousse, served with a sparkler and a congratulatory message.  the lush mousse came topped with crunchy chocolate pearls, whipped cream, and a little bit of candle-stuck banana.  we each got a sweet bite to end our wonderful dinner.\n\nin conclusion, my friends are the best - thank you girls for this weekend, and for this fun, delicious meal.  sushi samba was an a+ choice, worthy of a night i won't soon forget.", 
            "first we brought a bottle of really nice white wine here.\n\nthe manager came up and told us that the corkage fee would be $35. he then said if we bought one bottle on the wine list, including the large selection of sake, he would waive the corkage fee. epic win.\n\nwe got two bottles of cold unfiltered sake which i recommend to all the yelpers out there. my fiance had this bowl of soup dish that had pork, noodles, lot of spices, etc. i had some kind of roll which was very good.\n\na couple people in our party ordered churrasco <mark>Rio Grande</mark> which was this huge grill your own steak dish with tons of dipping sauces, sides, and meats. it was beyond delicious, and fun. you get to grill the meat on a hot stone.\n\nbasically, this is the only fusion restaurant i have even been to that worked. the menu had a lot of vegan and vegetarian items as well, and the servers handled our party which was a little rambunctious to say the least.\n\nprices are very reasonable.", 
            "the perfect date night spot!\n\nhad a really cool modern ambiance. they had these videos from asia playing on their tvs and we thought that was pretty interesting. the bathrooms were clean and very modern.\n5/5\n\nthe hosts that greeted us at the door were all really clean, pretty and professional.\nparticularly the short asian girl with the long red hair.\n5/5\n\nour waitress was nice, but she didn't explain the menu to us very well. she could have been a little more helpful because it was our first time there and the menu was a little complicated at first glance.\n3/5\n\nthe food was seriously incredible!!\n\nstarted off with a mushroom appetizer, <mark>Mushroom Tobanyaki</mark> w/ kobe, which ended up being a lot larger than i had expected, but i wasn't complaining at all. i had an egg added to it, which was recommended by the host with the red hair.\nwe also got an order of a5 <mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> and kobe beef taquitos with sea foam sauce. the sauce was a really nice twist to a classic. all really amazing. \n5/5\n\nthe drink menu was really great. for date nights i like to try specialty cocktails instead of my usual whiskey. i ordered a mango mojito and my boyfriend had an old fashioned. the mojito was a little bit too sweet for my liking but wasn't bad.\n4/5\n\nthe sushi was well made but i wasn't exactly blown out of the water and neither was my boyfriend. he and i are avid sushi eaters and we love complex rolls with a lot of flavors and textures to them. so the lima roll and san paulo roll were both just decent. we could have gone without them.\n3/5\n\nour entrees were really what impressed us. my boyfriend had a charrasco: <mark>Rio Grande</mark>  and he absolutely loved it. it was excellently paired with a variety of sauces. i'm not much of a red meat kind of eater but i had a small slice and was fairly impressed.\n5/5\n\ni had the large plate of chicken teriyaki. wasn't crazy about it but i definitely finished the whole dish. it was a little small compared to my boyfriends main dish but it was okay with me since we ordered so many dishes.\n4/5\n\noverall we had a really great date night here and would definitely come back for another one. loved it", 
            "hubby and i decided to take a stroll down the strip.  since we were staying at the encore we had to pass through the palazzo.  we decided to go through the grand canal shoppes to take advantage of the ac since it was 110 outside.  we walked by sushi samba and really liked the ambiance so we decided to have a late lunch there.\n\nwe had the <mark>Rio Grande</mark> ($45) which came with rib eye, w<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> picante, and a chicken sausage.  it also came with a serving of rice, beans, and various sauces to dip the aforementioned proteins.\n\nthe w<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> picante and rib eye were both melt in your mouth delicious :).  i wish we had a little more rice to go with the meats though.\n\nthe highlight of the night is definitely the sushi here.  (hey, maybe that's why they named the restaurant sushisamba.)  we ordered the <mark>Samba Sushi</mark> 7 piece with the green envy roll ($26).  the fish tasted fresh and the green envy roll is delicious!!\n\nthe service here was fantasic and we will definitely be back.", 
            "don't order takeout. \n\ni usually love sushisamba and make a point to eat there every time i go to vegas. this time, i was extremely disappointed.\n\ni ordered 2 <mark>Rio Grande</mark> to go since i had to catch a flight and the folks back home love the <mark>Rio Grande</mark>. unfor<mark>Tuna</mark>, part of my order was missing, even after i questioned it.\n\non the bill, the <mark>Rio Grande</mark> was listed as gaucho, so i asked about this and they assured me that it was the same. since i usually have a great meal and the service is usually good, i didn't question it. the <mark>Rio Grande</mark> is 45 dollars on the menu, so i expected to be charged 90 for both. however, for those two items, it was listed as $114. i also ordered 2 sides. \n\ni didn't bring it up because i usually love sushisamba and wouldn't mind paying more to support the restaurant. i also ordered a cocktail and the w<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> appetizer while waiting, so my bill was a bit hefty. on top of this, i included roughly a 20 percent so my total bill was about 190 - after i was reassured that my order was correct. i didn't have time to look through the bag because i needed to catch a flight, but once i got to the airport, i found out that the chorizo and the ribeye steak was not included (usually the <mark>Rio Grande</mark> comes with those two proteins and the picanha, but my order only had the picanha, the two sides i ordered.\n\nyou can imagine my frustration. when i takeout from a restaurant, especially one that i frequent, i expect my order to be correct. i honestly regret tipping so much and even ordering takeout from there today.\n\ni would give 1 star for this experience. the extra star is because i usually do have a positive experience (with philip, who is the best server in the world and has great service).\n\ni don't think i will come back here ever again. something amazing would have to happen for me to give this place a second chance.",

            "it's a small restaurant, nothing too formal. ordered the <mark>Rio Grande</mark> and dragon sushi roll. the meat was good. as for the sushi, i didn't care for it; it was pretty bland. the samba juice alcoholic beverage was the best!", 
            "i've stayed at the venetian/palazzo a dozen times and had never eaten at sushi samba. what a terrible mistake i've made all these years. looking for a restaurant in the hotel for our bachelor party, we decided upon sushisamba due to the variety of dishes, the vibrant atmosphere, and positive word of mouth reviews. we made a reservation through opentable, and were promptly seated upon arrival.\n\nsamba proclaims to have the most extensive sake selection in vegas, and we let our server choose a cheaper bottle for us and it was delicious. \n\n1) japanese a5 <mark>Seared W<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> Beef</mark> gyoza (4.5/5) - you get 5 delicious pot stickers with quality beef that just melts in your mouth\n\n2) yellowtail taquito (5/5) - there are two mandatory dishes to get and this is one of them. essentially a mini taco with yellowtail, roasted corn miso, and avocado. the explosion of flavor was mind-numbingly good and even friends who don't enjoy seafood loved this\n\n3) yellowtail sashimi (4.5/5) - 4 slices of high quality yellowtail, the sauce is delicate and sour\n\n4)  <mark>Berkshire Pork Belly</mark> (3.75/5) - i am admittedly biased towards <mark>Berkshire Pork Belly</mark> so i loved the dish. the butterscotch miso on top was a little overwhelming but the <mark>Berkshire Pork Belly</mark> itself was cooked to perfection\n\n5) <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> anticucho (5/5) - this is the other mandatory dish. we were very for<mark>Tuna</mark> because the table next to us came 15 minutes after and they ran out of this dish! the <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> skewer is  their signature dish and deservedly so. two skewers of <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> cooked so perfectly (soft on inside, slightly crispy exterior), there aren't enough superlatives to describe how delicious it is. \n\n6) <mark>Rio Grande</mark> (4/5) - from their churrasco menu, includes three types of meat: ribeye, chorizo, and w<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> picanha. i would not suggest this if you are eating by yourself or with another because it is just so much meat. in a larger group setting, i think this dish is perfect to share. the w<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> picanha is my favorite because the meat was so soft and tender.\n\nquite simply, i loved my experience at sushisamba. the service was fantastic. the food was <mark>Uni</mark> and delicious at the same time. the atmosphere embodies that of vegas- vibrant and exciting. the price of the dinner was what i'd expect from a \"strip\" restaurant, so be prepared to spend at least $50. \n\ni can't wait to go back to sushisamba for some yellowtail tacos and <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>."

            "i have visited sushi samba twice now and the more look back on it, the more i regret going there. the food there was good (not great), and the prices here are ridiculous. \n\nmiso marinated <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>: the <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> was the sized of my fist (no bigger). the flavors and texture of the <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> was great. i really enjoyed this dish, but for a tiny piece of fish priced at $29. it's not going to satisfy many and one might change theirr mind about sharing because of the small portions. if you want to add a side of rice it will set you back another $5!  \n--- 3.5 / 5 stars\n\nsalt & <mark>Salt and Pepper Squid</mark>: nothing out of the ordinary. portion was small once again. $14 \n--- 2.5 / 5 stars\n\nmaya roll - the sushi itself wasn't that great, but the salsa was quite tasty. $11 \n--- 3 / 5 stars\n\nbobo brazil - probably the tastiest roll here. the addition of kobe beef was great. small portions once again. $17\n--- 4 / 5 stars\n\nas you can see for the price you're paying here, you can easily select another restaurant (especially if you're ok with eating outside the venetian).\n\nif you're staying at the venetian i recommend eating at delmonico steakhouse (bone-<mark>Bone in Ribeye</mark>)", 
            "located in the shoppes at palazzo casino. my original plan was to get some comps redeemed for grand lux cafe (which is a great place as well). to my surprise, i had over 100 bucks available...i don't remember playing in the venetian poker room that much, but oh well. a bigger surprise, they had a long list of places i could use comps at, including steakhouses, and here. this is not the norm for vegas poker rooms. i guess this could be a venetian poker room review as well; they treat their customers very well! so i decided to try this place. \n\ni'm very glad that i did! my waitress isabella was very attentive, thorough, and answered any questions i had. top notch service! the rest of the waitstaff was even friendlier. my table was periodically kept clean, and lots of refills kept coming. \n\ni was expecting to eat regular sushi, maybe a tasting menu. and i never really thought of what the samba part meant. but i looked at the menu and there were lots of options available, fusion-style: from brazilian steaks to <mark><mark>Osetra Caviar Imperial 20g</mark> 20g</mark> rolls. i was in for an unexpected and different, yet very satisfying meal. \n\n-samba tea: this is a must try! i forgot what they were, but they included many different types of ingredients; the result being one of my favorite teas, if not my favorite. \n-bobo brazil samba roll: <mark>Seared W<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> Beef</mark>, brazilian-japanese style...something new and amazing!\n-miso-marinated chilean <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>...so good! one of the best fish i've ever had.\n-20oz <mark>Bone in Ribeye</mark> steak: juicy and delicious. loved the flavor! goes very well with the sushisamba dipping sauces. \n-warm chocolate banana cake (maple butter, banana chip, vanilla rum ice cream)...awesome!\n\nservice: 5/5; food: 5/5!\n\nthis was a <mark>Uni</mark> and awesome dining experience for me. and it looks like there's plenty more to try! thanks sushisamba. i would definitely come back!"

            "i was really excited about coming here after reading some of these reviews. this is gonna be a long one, please hang in there. \n\nreading about the omakase experiences was what got me interested. i'll spare you the details on the interior. (aunny d. explained it perfectly) the place is just fricken nice, beautifully decorated and the perfect hang out spot. they hired very attractive hostesses that were extremely friendly. the service we received from our waiter and the staff was simply awesome. \n\nnow for the food.....\n\nwe had a party of 5 and our original plan was to order both <mark><mark>Osetra Caviar Imperial 20g</mark> 20g</mark>($100) and the sushi samba omakase ($80). after going through the menu, we decided to order up a variety of items rather than go with the omakase. this way, you end up getting food that would be in the omakase anyway, more food (omakase 7 -course), and for less. \n\n\"small plates\" and \"seviches & tiraditos\"  (<mark>Grade A5</mark> a to f)\n\n<mark>Tuna Tataki</mark>  - (c+) chef overuses tatsoi that practically kills the dish\n\nseared kobe beef -(f) just not worth it. mushrooms overwhelms it\n\nchicharron de calamar - (a) excellent and generous amount!\n\nsashimi seviches - (b) grapefruit juice, jalape\\u00f1o, almond + \npassionfruit,  cucumber, cilantro \n\nsashimi tiraditos - (d) yellowtail jalape\\u00f1o and lemongrass + salmon orange and mustard miso\n\nsushi is obviously the trendy thing to have on a restaurants menu. sushi samba serves up some of the most below average sashimi and sushi. for $33, we had the <mark>Samba Sushi</mark> and sashimi combo. the sashimi was nice and thick.  both salmon and yellowtail were quite good, but the tuna was poorly prepared and lacked any freshness. the sushi was a complete joke. you get a small wafer thin slice of sashimi on a rabbit dropping sized glob of rice. most japanese restaurants, for any combo sushi plate, give you two pieces each - tuna, salmon, and yellowtail. sushi samba gives you one. my whole table thought this was a complete joke and ripoff. it doesnt end here....we ordered 4 different rolls. guess what? they're all puny and only have 4 pieces averaging $10-$20 each. we also ordered the 5 hand roll special ($28) which was okay, but the soy wrap just doesnt work. \n\nnow here's how we felt that the chefs were completely lazy or inexperienced. the sushi rice had no vinegar flavor and that is a must for sushi rice. plus, they used old rice because we had some hard dried pieces in our rolls. overall, i would not waste any money on sushi here. it's a complete insult to customers. \n\nour final dish was the 5 meat churrasco: grilled hanger steak, ribeye, pork tenderloin, chorizo, ling\\u00fci\\u00e7a with malagueta pepper oil and chimichurri.  - this dish was fantastic. the meat, cooked medium, was tender and juicy. (a+)\n\nnow, we had a total of about 16-17 items of various things off the menu. more than double than what you'll get in a omakase.  we had about 5 bottles of japanese beers. our cost  per person was $92 with tax and tip included. (5 people) \n\ni would love to come back just for the atmosphere and the churrasco. its simply a cool place to hang out and drink. dont come here for the japanese food. go to a real japanese restaurant for the omakase. just seeing how the sushi, sashimi, and rolls are prepared makes me question the chef's experience in preparing a true omakase.  \n\nif you actually read this whole thing. thanks!", 
            "modern chic fusion restaurant in the new palazzo hotel, featuring brazilian and japanese food. the interior much reminded me of social house in treasure island, dark and swanky. the small plates are meant for sharing, but the tab adds up quick. the server proclaimed their sake menu as the largest in the country, but unfor<mark>Tuna</mark> we didn't get to try any.\n\nwe had the <mark><mark>Assortment of Four</mark></mark> sashimi which were nice and fresh with delicate flavors. my favorite was the tuna with granny smith apple, serrano, and lime.\n\nthe <mark>Hamachi Kama</mark> (yellowtail cheek) was as good as i've had, but missing the grated daikon that it <mark><mark>Osetra Caviar Imperial 20g</mark> 20g</mark> comes with.\n\nchicken liver anticuchos (two skewers served over <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark>) were very livery. i expected them to be only lightly livery, like my favorite pho ga place serves up, not sure if it's due to the prep or the <mark>Grade A5</mark> liver or what.\n\nwe also tried a couple rolls, the <mark>Neo Tokyo</mark> with yellowfin tuna, tempura flake, aji panca. i liked this one more than the bobo brazil with seared kobe beef, avocado, kaiware, shiso, red onion, chimichurri. the kobe beef looked raw rather than seared, maybe seared would have brought out the flavors a bit. both rolls were pretty good though.\n\nthe standout of the meal was the <mark>Berkshire Pork Belly</mark> butterscotch miso, which was meltingly tender, with a subtle sweetness contrasting the richness of the luscious pork.\n\nwe also tried the little tiny crabs we saw in an ad, sawagani, which are flash fried japanese river crabs. these were literally tiny, and the small bite had a texture like an egg shell, with a flavor best described as a subtle fish sauce.\n\ncome here if you have an appetite for a variety of small bites with delicate but well thought out flavors.", 
            "foodie orgasms is all i can say about this establishment. i am friends with the managers at the southbeach location so when i went to go hang out with a friend in sin city i decided to pull rank and get some first class service knowing full well i was gonna lose money on the tables. \nyeah i lost money but wasnt disappointed one bit at the sushisamba location at the palazzo hotel. i will avoid mentioning having to drop a former friend from ruining my dinner right b4 it started but as soon as i got to the location which i must say is unbelievable and by far is the best designed sushisamba, a close second will be the now defunct location in dallas at the galleria mall. i felt like a kid when i entered the restrooms. i had a nice corner to myself and the hostess was kind enuff to keep me company since i got jilted by a former friend (which i refuse to talk about).  \ni got ala carte type service and even the chef, jose came out to greet me and making me feel special cos he remembered me from the southbeach spot. the taquitos were incredible i had the yellow tail and the lobster one. i decided i was only going to do small plates so i ventured to the anticuchos and ordered the chicken liver which just melted in my mouth and made vegas worthwhile and followed by the chilean <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> that the hostess recommended. for my drink i always get their caiprinha which is like a brazilian mojito and was on point.\n\nnow i was getting full but the chef surprised me with a kobe beef plate which was sushi <mark>Grade A5</mark> once again splendid and lest i forget i also ordered the <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark> for my side which is ridiculously tasty. \n\nthere were several groups in town for bachelors parties and partying in general and the decor just made the groups blend in and make it very private. \n\nwill definitely be back", 
            "went to sushi samba last night for dinner with eight people and absolutely loved the restaurant.  the decor was very peruvian and exotic than your normal sushi titled restaurant.   one thing is for sure though, the sushi is amazing.  had the <mark>El Topo</mark> roll and some of the sushi sampler platter.... both the warm <mark>El Topo</mark> and the cold sampler platter were of the finest <mark>Grade A5</mark> i've ever tasted.  i would have to saw the overall food quality was everything i expected from the palazzo.  the plates are more tapas styled with the lobster tacos and apps being very tiny in size but gargantuan in flavor.  \n\ni would recommend that if you go with a large appetite to look on the menu for the \"large plates\" section lol.... the 3-meat and 5-meat for $40 and $60 respectfully will be filling enough for 2 people and not break the bank if your on a budget... don't sleep on the sushi rolls and bring your own sake and have them cork it.... sake prices in the restaurant are silly.", 
            "wanted to try ss for a long time, and now that i was staying @ palazzo, i had to get in there. we went for an early dinner on a weekday. the place was empty, and we were seated right away. the menu was honestly, somewhat intimidating, and really shi shi. i like sushi, sashimi, sushi rolls, etc. i didnt really vibe with the brazilian twist the menu had. i did not research the menu enough before going in there. (which was good in retrospect, because then i probably wouldnt have gone there, and missed a great meal.) i assumed- sushi samba= sushi. lol. we ordered regular sushi rolls, sashimi pieces and <mark>Miso Soup</mark>. the miso was great. the <mark>Grade A5</mark> the sushi was out of this world. def some of the best i have had, and i am a sushi addict. i have eaten it all over at home, and i try to get it whenever i am on vacation. def recommend. there are high prices for the specialty fusion foods (which made me nervous and therefore i stuck with what i knew), but the place is gorgeous, service was fantastic, and if you are willing to take a chance on the specialty foods, im sure you wont be disappointed.", 
            "the staff here was very attentive and the space looks fantastic but the menu was a bit too weird for me. most things on the menu are japanese but with a brazilian twist. my gf and i weren't totally up for the twist. we're just big fans of japanese food especially sushi. we ordered some rolls and <mark>Miso Soup</mark> and found everything to be fantastic. this was the best <mark>Grade A5</mark> we ever had in vegas. if the menu wasn't so weird and intimidating i would have given this place more stars.", 
            "hells to the noooooo!!!!!!!!!  this place does not even deserve my rating but i must warn the yahoo's out there that think it might be okay since it is in the palazzo.  \n\ngroup of six...all sushi enthusiasts from california...ready to throw down a great meal after a great show (btw blue man group rocks!) \n\nthe worst service evah! why have three different kitchens if your servers cannot keep up with one!?  ordered sparkling saki moon rabbit...got star rabbit instead...mmmm...ok...but to have the nerve to treat me as if i didn't know which saki i ordered?! shame.  \n\nthen we look at the menu...\nseriously? $6 for one piece of sushi? wow!  i know i can get <mark>Grade A5</mark> sushi without the price elsewhere so i opted for a quasi-meal and ordered the lobster for $25...knowing it was gonna be small, i figured i would try and get somewhat of a meal since my sushi bill alone would've been off the charts.  i was told it was the shell with three small pieces of lobster on top.  wrong! i about fell over and died when i realized, after digging through the smelt eggs with my chopsticks, that there was no meat!  no lobster meat whatsoever!!!  i went in again and picked up what i thought was meat and it was a piece of shell.  holy shit...they just served me lobster tail without meat...no lie.\n\ni sent it back and refused to order anything else since the rest of my party was almost done with their meal.  i was annoyed, hungry, and our check took a fucking century because our server knew she was getting her 20% no matter how shitty our experience.  \n\nbeware! this place is a sham and a sorry excuse for servicing people that are willing and ready to spend good money for a good meal.  i hate the strip for that very reason.", 
            "my friend wanted to celebrate her tax return and take me to lunch (hooray for me!!) she wanted to have sushi on the strip, well mostly all the sushi restaurants on the strip don't open until dinner, except sushisamba, so that's where we landed.  while we waited for them to open, i was scoping yelp reviews to see what we should order. the <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark> seemed to be the #1 suggestion, so that's what we started out with.  neither  one of us were impressed, sorry to say, but i felt like i was eating just a giant piece of corn kernal. but it was all uphill from there. \n\nour server, drago, was very attentive and full of suggestions, he had asked if we dined here before and i told him i had been to the one in miami, then he said he would bring us something on the house for coming back. when i tell you, you must order these, i'm not exaggerating, they were excellent, not on the menu, <mark>Broiled Peruvian Bay Scallop</mark>, prepared differently than the one on the menu. they were so good we had to order another round. i am a huge fan of yellowtail, so we ordered the yellowtail taquitos, so tasty, i loved the crunch that the mini taco shell added to the yellowtail flavor. next up was a table favorite as well, <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> miso, it melted in your mouth.  i was skeptical at first, they are served on a skewer, so i wasn't expecting the amazing flavor i tasted when i took my first bite. drago suggested the <mark>El Topo</mark> roll, both of us like hot,, super spicy food, this roll had a nice kick at the end, i normaily don't like any kind of dairy on my sushi rolls, i.e. cream cheese, etc....but this had melted mozzarella, it was excellent. then came the grand finale, my friend is a huge kobe beef fan so she wanted to try the <mark>Seared W<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> Beef</mark>, excellent <mark>Grade A5</mark>5, ishi yaki hot stone, dipping sauces, vegetables. presentation was so nice, lots of different sauces to try.  dessert, yes we still had room for dessert, we tried the peruvian hot chocolate con cr\\u00e8me served with <mark><mark>Osetra Caviar Imperial 20g</mark> 20g</mark> and the coco duo dark and white chocolate custard with praline. the second one was by far the best. a must. also try the house made iced tea, they mix fresh orange juice, lime juice and lemon with black tea.....think i drank a pitcher of it.  good food, service, ambiance!", 
            "sushi rice here is always dry. it might not be their fault. it might just be the air in vegas. i wouldn't go here for the sushi, but the a5 <mark>Grade A5</mark> cooked at the table on the stone was delicious. other stuff ... well, i've had better.", 
            "rounding out my three night kobe adventure was sushi samba.  this place was pretty darn cool. i give them 4 stars for the kobe and 3 for the rest.  the sushi was very good, but not \"las vegas\" good.  there are far better places if you just want sushi.  but this place is different, offering a spin of brazillian flare on the japanese standard.  i liked the playfulness.... \n\nbut back to the important stuff... the kobe!  <mark>Grade A5</mark>5 from japan (i'm guessing vegas had a shipment of this because every place said they had a5 japanese kobe!)  sushi samba brought out a plate of raw sliced kobe next to a line of dry and wet spices/marinades.  then came the huge hot rock.  we were then instructed to dip the beef in the marinade of choice, set on rock for 30 seconds a side, then sprinkle with preferred dry spice.  i watched the ladies at our table go first and i saw them immediately go to their \"happy place\" with the first bite.  after the rest of the table ate, i could see everyone counting the remaining pieces to see how many more bites they had.  hahahaha!!! so much fun!\n\ngreat sake list if you like that (which i do).  hundreds of junmai daiginjo bottles going into the $1,000's.  i found a decent one for $50 (300ml).  so recap, get the kobe, enjoy the sushi... don't go if sushi is all that you want, there's better.", 
            "oh. my. god. i want to eat here every day of my life, if only for the ishi yaki. my wallet is already throwing a fit about the thought of how quickly i would go broke, but akdsjhfakjldhf. words cannot describe how much i want to go back and eat all the things. well more specifically, all the ishi yaki.\n\nin reality though, sushisamba is unfor<mark>Tuna</mark> a sometimes food (unless you're a bajillionaire, in which case, dine on! i will live vicariously through you). it's just too expensive for me, as a student to afford. thank goodness someone else was picking up the check when i went.\n\nmy family and i had our christmas dinner here at like... 9pm (yea, we did christmas in vegas). it was by far, the fanciest christmas dinner i have ever had. \n\nwe were seated in the back room area since we had a relatively large party, but since it was so late, it was mostly empty there, which was simultaneously nice and eery. our waiter suggested we do the tasting menu, where he and the chef craft our meal for us, but since my mom had just been here with some colleagues the week before, we decided to just let her order for us, since she knew what was good. \n\n- <mark>Salt and Pepper Squid</mark>: the seasoning made this extra delicious-- a really good starter\n- crispy yellowtail taquitos: also yummy, though i may be biased because yellowtail is one of my favorite fish; very lime-y\n- <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark>: a twist on regular tempura, but absolutely delicious; if you don't like spicy mayo, maybe not your thing\n- ishi yaki: words cannot describe. <mark>Grade A5</mark>5 japanese waygu that you cook yourself on a hot japanese river stone? yes, please! you take a slice of meat, dip it in oil, and then put it on the hot stone to let it cook. there's a few different dipping sauces and three different types of salt that you can add to your meat. all of them are delicious, though i am partial to the black salt. there were some pears on the plate, so i was like what the heck, why not cook those on the stone too. still delicious. even thinking about this is making me crave it. the ishi yaki is really expensive, but if you're going to go for any of the japanese waygu options, go for this one because it is definitely the most <mark>Uni</mark>.\n- we ordered a bunch of sushi rolls, which were good, but not the most amazing ones i've ever had.\n- also, the lychee bubbletail is really good. the alcohol is not overpowering, it's not too sweet, and they put a real lychee (probably from a can) in it.\n\nrandom: i really like the music on their website... that probably sounds really weird, but it's true. love it.\n\ntl;dr: i know for a fact that the main reason why i love sushisamba as much as i do is because i was not paying. it was a crazy expensive meal, but it was delicious because we ordered some rather expensive (but good! oh so very good!) things. if you're not willing to splurge, you'll probably think i'm crazy for giving them a 5-star review, but if you are, be prepared to be amazed. just don't think about the check. and get the ishi taki. 5-stars for that alone.", 
            "food is great and creative here. they have a very limited nigiri and sashimi selection, but it's all <mark>Grade A5</mark> fish. they seems to specialize more in these off the wall rolls that will get your taste buds going crazy. service isn't bad, but our waiter seemed to be spread thin between the tables he had. overall prices are a bit expensive. average roll is $20 and that's for 3-4 pieces. each nigiri sushi piece was $4-$6 and the toro was $16 per piece. yes i understand that sushi at this great quality can be found cheaper near your home, but let's face it, the rent on las vegas blvd. isn't cheap!!", 
            "fun fun! took a large party here for dinner and it was delicious! i give it 3 stars because i felt like the servings were  skimpy on the kobe beef and some of the sashimi- and they didn't do a great job placing the items ( like the hot stone to cook the kobe beef) within reach of everyone on the table. for the prices ( i selected the 100 dollars a person option) i felt like there should have been better service in this area. also some of the dishes to pass that had sauce on them ended up getting spilled on some of my guests and it was a little awkward having to wipe the melted butter off the shirt of the guy next to me. maybe they need deeper dishes for those items to prevent this from happening. the fish was <mark>Grade A5</mark> and the sushi was fantastic. everyone loved the food once it made it on their plates and it was different from any other sushi experience i have ever had. i'll be back!"

(our drinks were good for the most part except for that second obamarama we ordered.  but hey, some people like more alcohol in their cocktails!)  i had a bigger problem with the kitchen output and their consistency.  with certain orders coming out, sometimes you got two of something and other times you got one.  our friend mentioned that we got more sushi in our order than when he ordered it.  (makes you wonder what happened to the other pieces.)\n\noverall, we had a decent experience at sushi samba.  you definitely can't beat the price and the atmosphere is casual, which is nice alternative at a strip hotel.\n\n3.5 stars.\n\nthey also offer a happy hour (sunday through thursday from 4 to 7 pm, and then a reverse happy hour from 10 pm to close), available in the bar area only.\n\n(pics posted, of course!)",

            "i went here with a bachelorette party of about 7 of us.  none of us had been here before and didn't know what to expect.  we made dinner reservations, but still had to wait a bit to get our table.  once we got in... the server was definitely hospitable, gracious, and informative - i only wished i remembered his name to give a shout out. he informed us of the type of restaurant sushi samba was, which is a fusion of japanese, brazilian and peruvian.  we all weren't sure of what to get so he suggested we do a \"tasty menu\" which i think was the omakase (on the website menu).  this allowed us to try the different types of food the menu had to offer.  we let him know what we liked and what we didn't like and he informed the chefs and they brought out a plethora of tasty treats that was enough for 7 of us.  it started off with some appetizers, such as the otsumani ( an assortment of edamame, tempura green beans and shishito  - spicy peppers.... absolutely delicious!) and an assortment of other appetizers that i can't remember.  we then had a n array of seviche.  after that we had different types of meats on skewers and then topped off the evening with sashimi and sushi rolls.  one thing, we were all in awe of the food , we could hardly remember what everything was.  a huge highlight of the dinner was the yellowtail seviche! an absolute delicious delight.  another overwhelming mouth watering treat was the chilean <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> on skewers with <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark>.  i believe we also had the <mark>Samba Strip</mark> roll at the end of the meal which was thoroughly mouth quenching!  we all sat back after the meal and were all very happy and pleased with this establishment and all said how we were going to have to come back there every vegas excursion we go on.  it is a bit pricey.. but i think the food is worth the $$$$.  on top of all that, the atmosphere was definitely pleasing as well as the music which kept me moving in my seat all night.  this place is well worth the 5 star rating and worth the $$$$!",

            "so we had a fabulous room in the palazzo and needed to have a fabulous dinner to go with it.  we were dying to go back to bobby flay's mesa grill in cesar's, but when i saw that our own very hotel had a fusion restaurant, marrying japanese, brazilian, and peruvian flavors, i knew we had to take our money there.  my daughter's part peruvian, and she never gets to experience the cuisine.  plus she loves sushi...well, vegetable sushi to be exact.  \n\nas soon as we arrived, i was feeling the service and the decor....nice hostess seated us right away and an informative waitress gave us the rundown of the menu.  i had plenty of time after ordering to scope the murals (fat tip usage in a restaurant?  oh yea!).  \n\nthe children's menu also impressed me.  it was a cute menu of that collabed with an artist to give a percentage of each bento box to charity.  wow!  my kid ordered the sliders and switched out sweet potato fries for <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark> (corn on steriods, as the waitress called it).  we weren't extremely hungry, or in the need for a drink, so we ordered light:\n\nteriyaki chicken skewers\n<mark>Miso Soup</mark>\navocado rolls\nprawn tempura\nmore <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark>\nplantains\nwhite rice \n\nas you can see, we didn't order any of the restaurant specialties, but what we did get was delicious and filling.  however, as you probably already figured out, this place is $$$!  the <mark>Miso Soup</mark> was $6 and no different than the free soup we get at our fave sushi spot back home, and the white rice was.......$5!  wtf!  $5 for \"japanese\" style rice?  just because you put sesame seeds on top does not make it $5 (we are filipino and require white rice with our protein always.)  oh well, that was the most disappointing part of the dinner.  \n\nthe most impressive part of our dinner was the kids bento box.  i wish they had bento boxes for adults because that's what i always order at a japanese joint.  her sliders were the smallest sliders i have ever seen, but they were oh-so-cute and worked for a child.  they came with seasonal fruit, which was like 2 blueberries and half of a strawberry, and the <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark> was soooo good!  my daughter ended up skewing up some on the toothpicks from the fruit (sushi samba, if you use that on the menu, please credit jada).  plus, the box came with the cutest dessert ever...a tiny smoothie with pop rocks on top and a little brownie ice cream sundae.  once again, so small and petite but it worked for her!\n\ni'm not sure if i would be excited to go back again, as i still am to go to mesa, but if i do i might give the drinks a try.  after reading many of these reviews, i realize i have missed out on some great sushi specialties and drinks (and a trip to the fancy bathroom!).\n\n-tiph",

            "it is time for me to write my review for sushisamba after all the times i have been to this location. the ambiance in the strip branch is pretty nice. you don't get to mingle with a crowd of people like in their dromo (miami) location but you still get to have a hell of a dining experience. the dining room is pretty dark almost like a nightclub, the music is loud and the drinks are strong. so all in all, this is a supper club.\n\notsumami is a must to have as a starter. the trio of shishito peppers, <mark>Green Bean Tempura</mark> and edamame is the perfect way to start over a round of caipirinhas.\n\nafter this you can do a round of robata. <mark>Filet Mignon</mark>, <mark>Lamb Chop</mark>, chicken, eggplant and <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>, they're all great and some of them come with the huge <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark> which are so tasty.\n\nas for the main course, i have tried their <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> entree which i loved until i had the moqueca. the moqueca is simply the best seafood stew i have ever had in my whole life. it is a medley of shrimp, squid, <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> and crayfish cooked in a pot with coconut milk and cashews.\n\ntop this with more caipirinhas and maybe a couple of their desserts from their expansive dessert menu and you'll have yourself a great dinner right before you head into an endless vegas night... you'll have a great dinner in a great ambiance with great music and on top of it you'll have a little bit of a buzz...", 
            "every year i go to miami for winter music conference i have been lured to go eat at sushi samba over on lincoln but i have never had the chance to eat there. not sure why. maybe it always seemed to packed and i didn't want to wait. i know now that i missed out on some damn good meals.\n\nright before thanksgiving my wife and my father in law traveled over to las vegas for a few nights. as we walked into the venetian hotel i saw a billboard for sushi samba at the adjoining hotel, the palazzo and i knew then where we were going for dinner. we went up to our room, freshened up and headed out.\n\nwe were quickly seated (it was a sunday night and the place was half full) and placed some drink orders. my wife had one of the specialty drinks which was quite good and i had some nigiri sake. we started off with the otsumami appetizer which came with edamame, shishito peppers and <mark>Green Bean Tempura</mark> with black truffle aioli. all 3 were excellent but we found ourselves fighting over the green beans and that yummy aioli. \n\nnext up was a mixture of ceviches and tiraditos. we tried 4 all together with both salmon and yellowtail. amazing flavor. the yellowtail ceviche taquitos were also amazing. i could eat those all day. we also had a couple of things from the robata grill. the stand out was the miso glazed <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>. it was incredible. so tasty. it was the best <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> i have ever had. period! the <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark> that came with it also was quite tasty.\n\nthe waitress recommended the mushroom toban-yaki with some grilled duck from the robata grill. it was so intense and earthy. i definitely got use of those umami tastebuds with this dish. loved every bit. after all that, we saved room for 2 speciality sushi rolls, the <mark>Samba Strip</mark> roll and the <mark>Neo Tokyo</mark> roll. both were amazing and filled with different flavors. \n\nall in all one of the best meais i have had in a while and i have had some amazing meals recently. if in vegas, you owe yourself. do it.", 
            "came in for lunch on a sunday, which was very quiet, but nice. \n\nsushi samba is a blend of japanese, brazilian and peruvian cuisine and they had plenty of dishes to choose from.\n\nwe got seated at the bar, which i find odd that you can't order straight from the sushi chefs that are standing right in front of you.  so it's like seating at the tables anyway, but your closer to the tvs and can stare at the fresh fishes available.  \n\nwe started with seared kobe beef- ponzu gele\\u00e9, warm japanese mushrooms, truffled tofu crema, i thought it was a little too salty, but overall, the dish was very good.  \n\nsashimi tiradito- yellowtail jalape\\u00f1o and lemongrass- the yellowtail was fresh and the sauce was good. it was more lemongrass tasting, didn't really taste the jalapeno. \n\nanticuchos which are two skewers served with <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark> (double the size of normal corn and a bit harder) <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> and miso- the fish was perfectly cooked and very tasty.  this was the most recommended dish and it was worth the try.  there was no fishy taste. \n\nsamba rolls- <mark>El Topo</mark>- salmon, jalape\\u00f1o, shiso leaf, fresh melted mozzarella, crispy onion- warm rolls, very tasty, melted right in my mouth.  \n\nfor sushi, their ika was good and their sake (salmon) was pretty darn fresh tasting. \n\ntheir green tea was also very good. i believe it's $5.  \n\noverall, the service was great and quick.  they came and refilled everything without asking.  food was good and i can't wait to come back to try everything else.", 
            "oh lord, this review is a toughie to write.  sushi samba is a <mark>Uni</mark> restaurant in that it's a blend of japanese, brazilian and peruvian influence, and we had so many different flavors and samplings of things, this will be quite a mixed review.  \n\nthey definitely anticipate people being unable to choose from the wide-range of items on the menu, so they actually give you the option of letting the waitress put together your order based on likes, dislikes, preferences, food allergies, and based on price, etc.  we spouted out... \"salmon!\"   \n\n                \"tuna!\"  \n\n\"spice!\"        \"allergic to shrimp!\"    \n\n                 \"jalapenos!\"  \n\nso, the waitress brought out the following:\n\n(1) edamame with sea salt and lime.\n\nsmall plates:\n(2) berkshire pork gyoza (kabocha pumpkin pure\\u00e9 and su-shoyu dipping sauce) - very good! the pumpkin puree is a nice touch!  just be sure to scrape it all off the plate when you pick up the gyoza!\n(3) <mark>Tuna Tataki</mark> (white asparagus, fresh heart of palm, avocado, tatsoi, citrus soy) - this is seared tuna, marinated a bit in vinegar and ginger - also very good. i have never had tatsoi before - but it is quite good! tastes and looks a bit like spinach but is better!\n\nseviches:\n(4) salmon asparagus, red radish, pineapple, lime - quite good! 2nd fave of the four seviches.\n(5) yellowtail jalape\\u00f1o and lemongrass - our table came to the consensus that this was the winner of the 4 seviches.  perfect amount of spice from the japaleno, and just a bit of tang from the lemongrass - goes very well together with the hamachi! very good!\n(6) tuna granny smith apple, serrano, lime - i did not like this one - the apple taste is awful in my opinion... pass.\n(7) the last one had a very <mark><mark>Osetra Caviar Imperial 20g</mark> 20g</mark> seviche taste - lemon, lime very simple, and good.  the type of fish they used escapes me now.. apologies.\n\nrobata:\n(8) <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> and miso anticucho - <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> pieces marinated with delicious miso on skewers - so good. the fish is very fresh and tender - and the miso is light, but very tasty!  it also comes with <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark> kernels - which if you haven't had it - each kernel is about 5 times the size of a normal corn kernel, and is a bit meatier. yum!\n\nlarge plates:\n(9) toban yaki organic mushroom, charred green onion, garlic chips, kobe beef! they split this in two bowls - which was strange because one bowl was better than the other. not sure how much i liked this dish - the sauce was very heavy/creamy yet bland and lacked something. the other bowl had more tang to the sauce and was better - inconsistency - not good!  mushrooms were yummy though!\n\nsamba rolls:\n(10) el toro (salmon, jalape\\u00f1o, shiso leaf, fresh melted mozzarella, crispy onion): the fave of the bunch yet still not that great seeing as how it doesn't really \"count\" as sushi - melted mozzarella? come on.\n(11) <mark>Neo Tokyo</mark> yellowfin tuna, tempura flake, aji panca - this was a disappointment! the waitress called it the \"ultimate <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark>\" - but it was not spicy whatsoever.  she mentioned that they use a fresher version of tuna - not so when you order <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> elsewhere (where they use the leftover bits of fish and mash it up). meh, pass.\n(12) veggie kun avocado, tomato, arugula, oshinko, yamagobo, wasabi nori flake, tofu miso - pass! tastes fresh but dude - where's the fish!? \n(13) can't remember this last roll because i was so full and couldn't have anymore!!!\n\nthis was so much food - 70 per person. i'd pass on the rolls, and go for samplings of their other small dishes, seviches, skewers! 4 stars.",

            "japanese, peruvian, and brazilian fusion. i'd think that intrigue alone would be enough to bring anyone to sushi samba.\n\ni'll have to admit that i was nervous when our knowledgeable and friendly server began talking about the three different kitchens, the different ways to order...it all sounded way too complicated. (to be honest, i just wanted to fill my stomach so that i'd be able to drink later!) luckily, one of our friends is a sushi samba master, and he did all of the ordering for our table. \n\ni pretty much loved everything - if only for the novelty of it all - but a few stand-out dishes were:\n1) yellowtail ceviche taquito: they looked like little yellowtail and guacemole tacos. somehow it all worked...\n2) yellowtail tiradito: kinda like a ceviche? yellowtail, jalepeno, and lemongrass - i'm definitely a fan of sour and spicy.\n3) fresh oysters and <mark><mark>Jumbo Shrimp</mark></mark>: no explanations needed.\n4) <mark>El Topo</mark> roll: salmon, jalepeno, melted cheese, and crispy onions\n\ni also would recommend getting a side of <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark> (which went along with our churrasco plate) just to see how huge those kernels are! it's kind of ridiculous. anyway, not only was the food great, but the service was among the best - they even have a \"sake sommelier\", so to speak. the place itself is energetic, contemporary, and very, very vegas. i can't wait to go back!",

            "we came in for a bachelorette dinner and we were a group of 15. our server, max, was fantastic!  he got a feel for what we liked and suggested we do a \"prix fixe\" style dinner. great idea! for $50 a person, we got some of everything. everything was good.  i was so full, i couldn't even have any of the food that came toward the end.  the manager even gave us a \"tree\" of drinks on the house to help us celebrate! definitely taking my husband here next!\n\nupdate 7/10/12\n\nthis experience was a little lack luster compared to my first.  i did end up taking my husband here as previously mentioned.  i entrusted our menu choices to our server.  not as impressed. maybe i just didn't care for her choices as much as i did the first time with max.  she ordered us these grilled chilies with lime, and they were just okay for me.  little disappointed though, as i mentioned to her how much i liked the black truffle green beans and didn't get any.  i did tell her i didn't mind raw things, but i should've stopped right there because thats pretty much all we got after that.  the best things were the pot stickers with pumpkin puree and a couple of the sushi rolls.  also, <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark> was delicious! next time, i'm gonna order myself so i know i'll like everything.", 
            "even though it is on the pricier side, it was worth it. my soul was happy with me after i ate here. in fact, my soul asked me to eat twice here. i happily obliged. the first time we were only there for a quick snack and a drink, but the second time we actually ate a meal there, so i'll review the second time. \n\ni should give one caveat: i'm not particularly familiar with authentic brazilian or japanese food. that said, i found this fusion restaurant both intriguing and completely intoxicating. \n\nthe waitress we had the first time was good, but i really remember our second waiter, max. he was very attentive and gave fantastic recommendations, but wasn't pushy about it. most importantly, you can tell he's actually excited about the food. it made a huge difference, because seeing someone so excited to tell you about the ingredients, how the food is prepared, and what flavors are going on together really adds to a wonderful food experience, in my opinion. the waiter ended up recommending a $60 per person meal, a tasting menu of sorts. it sounds like a lot, but given the prices, it was really very fair considering the amount of food we got. as such, i'm not going to talk about every little thing, but more the highlights. \n\nthe <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark> was addicting. it was a little closer to the hominy side of the corn spectrum, but it was buttery and had just a bit of texture. if it doesn't come as a side, i absolutely recommend trying it as a separate side dish. it does come as a side to the <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> skewers, which i think were my single most favorite thing i tried there. it was buttery and delicious, and so flavorful in little bites. i wish i could describe it better than just \"flavorful,\" but i'm not even sure how to describe how delicious it was. i'll just say that while i was eating it, i hoped it would never stop (so inappropriate but i can't help it: that's what she said). \n\nhamachi tacos and a plate of various sashimi were incredible. i liked the sashimi just a little more because the bold flavors of the sauces surprisingly married well with the fish flavor, without overpowering it. \n\nthe most surprising part of the night: there was a sushi roll that included melted mozzerella. yes. mozzerella and salmon. i was so skeptical of this one, and it took me a few tries to get used to it, but once i did, it was like a warm blanket. if you can push aside the weirdness, it's a good roll. \n\nanother piece of fabulosity we had was a yellowtail seviche (they do spell it with an \"s\"). it was tangy but still let the other flavors show, and that is one of the items (along with the <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>) i will absolutely order again next time i am in vegas. \n\nlast, but certainly not least, the waiter concocted a duck hot-pot for us. i've not had much exposure to duck, and was weary of this one, but it was in a buttery sauce with lots of mushrooms, and it was incredibly silky and rich. needless to say, after all this food, we were stuffed!!! and of course, very happy. the manager came out to talk to us about the food as well, and i thought that was nice. \n\ni also tried the cucumber martini and the blackberry mojito. the mojito was good, but not particularly special. the cucumber martini, on the other hand, was light and refreshing and absolutely amazing. \n\nsushi samba is definitely first on my list next time i come to vegas!", 
            "here's some easy math: \n\nawesomeness = sushisamba = japanese/brazilian/peruvian fusion.\n\nyup.\n\ni recently traveled to the sin city for work and of course, had to try as many good restaurants as i could. while most offered decent food, they were definitely overpriced.\n\nbut sushisamba was simply awesome. my friend and i ordered four plates and they were the perfect amount of food for two ladies to share. more importantly, everything was fresh and delicious.\n\nhere is what we gobbled down.\n\n<mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> and miso:\nomg. the fish blew me away with its tenderness and deep flavor. the decorative <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark> also added a nice touch to the dish. a must try.\n\nyellow tail jalapeno and lemongrass:\nincludes 4 pieces of sashimi. pleasantly spicy with jalapeno, the fish was nicely chilled and tasted very refreshing.\n\n<mark>Samba Sushi</mark> assortment:\nhas 12 pieces, including 8 kinds of sashimi and one type of roll. everything was very, again, fresh. i loved how the rice, fish and all the ingredients melted in my mouth.\n\nyellowtail seviche:\nwrapped in crispy tortillas and sprinkled with lime juice, the seviche tacos were a nice little summery treat in this boiling city.\n\nwhat's better is that good food is not the only reason that i like this fusion restaurant.\n\nour waitress was nice and gave us good suggestions on what to order. my other colleague who came here with a big group also raved about the great service they received.\n\nthe ambiance was modern and romantic. i felt like i walked into a trendy, reddish dome, with interesting circular decor.\n\nthe bill? certainly a splurge. but for the experience i had, it was well worth it.\n\nsome final math: visit vegas = try sushisamba.", 
            "bbq <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> skewers, <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark>, yellow tail terditico, and a cup of <mark>Miso Soup</mark>. i could probably eat this every day for the rest of my life and not complain.", 
            "i had an amazing dinner here for my bachelorette party! i've been to sushi samba in miami & was happy to be back. the vibe is very upbeat with a club feel & the food is a <mark>Uni</mark> fusion of south american & japanese...who would of thought?? our server was matt & not only was he attractive but he was kind enough to serve us a penis cake with sparkler candles...awesome! we heard about their \"secret\" prix fix menu here, so we decided to go with it. our server asked us a bunch of questions about our preferences & food allergies to gage what type of menu we would receive. it didn't matter because everthing they served us was absolutely great.  here is a run down of what we had: \n\n-<mark>Green Bean Tempura</mark> (light & crunchy) \n-shishita peppers (could eat a pound of these everyday) \n-pork gyoza (savory with a wonderful sweet potato puree underneath) \n-yellowtail sashimi (so fresh with a lovely sauce underneath) \n-lobster taco (good but doesn't knock my socks off like the others) \n-<mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark> (ummm...so good cant even begin to describe) \n-chilean <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> & chicken teriyaki skewers served with <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark> (<mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> was like butter, chicken was ok, couldn't stop eating the corn...think corn on steriods) \n-rolls (we got a variety, don't remember exactly but they were all very fresh) \nthat basically sums up our heavenly experience at sushi samba. our bill was pretty hefty after all was said & done. but it was totally worth it....i will be back! this time sans penis cake ;) thanks matt!!!", 
            "we were promised a \"dining experience\", and that's what we got!\n\na group of 6 of us came here, and we were instantly charmed by our server, michael. he recommended a custom \"dining experience\" for about $50-60 per person, based on our likes and dislikes. food just kept coming out and we had no idea what to expect, but michael really hit the nail on the head with everything he picked for us.\n\nsome of the highlights:\n\n- yellowtail tacos\n- yellowtail in lemongrass sauce\n- <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> (i don't eat <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>, but my friends were raving about it!). the <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark> that came with it was excellent \n- some kind of steak, cooked medium rare served with rice and beans\n- a sushi platter with <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark>, california, and <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark> rolls\n\nsushisamba is really great for groups, and since you can customize a meal based on your budget, it can be relatively affordable, too. and every dish was amazing! i definitely recommend it, and hope to try brunch at one of their nyc locations.", 
            "this restaurant caught my eye because it was something out of the ordinary from your typical sushi restaurant. the menu offered an intriguing variety but when i began reading the reviews i knew i had to try it. i would suggest anyone going there for the first time to try the dining experience because you may think you know what you want but the chef knows better! the server asks if there is anything you do not like or if you have any food allergies and then how much money per person you're looking to spend. there are options anywhere from $50 per person to $130 per person if kobe beef if something that interests you. as it was for a special occasion we opted for $80 per person and even though thats more than i have probably ever spent on a single meal there were no regrets.\n\ncourse #1 consisted of berkshire pork gyoza which is basically pork dumplings in a pumpkin puree and yellowtail ceviche taquitos, both of which were absolutely delicious and not necessarily something i would have ordered on my own.\n\ncourse #2 was yellowtail sashimi in a spicy peruvian sauce with a slice of red jalapeno on top and octopus sashimi in a japanese citrus sauce which again were both to die for!\n\ncourse #3 had an array of <mark>Filet Mignon</mark>, <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>, <mark>Alaskan King Crab</mark> and <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark>. all were moist and tender but the <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> absolutely melted in your mouth! <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark> was a yummy alternative to <mark><mark>Osetra Caviar Imperial 20g</mark> 20g</mark> as well.\n\nfinally, course #4 was the main sushi dinner. <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark> rolls were delicious, but the <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> with i believe tuna on top was absolutely amazing! there was also <mark>Half Maine Lobster</mark> and another roll which i believe had lobster in it as well and was probably the only thing of the entire dinner that i was not absolutely amazed with, but it was still good!\n\nanother great thing about this place is they tell you if there is anything throughout this meal you do not like they will take it back and bring you something else! as our server said, \"its like a money back guarantee!\"\n\nanyways this is definitely a place i would tell everyone who loves trying new things to try or even just the sushi lover. do it! it will not disappoint!\n\nonly part i would complain about is the fact that there is not one in california!!!", 
            "sushi samba is the best it can get! the chef's tasting menu is the way to go. i can't even fully describe how amazing everything we had was. we started off with the edamame, shisito and <mark>Green Bean Tempura</mark>. the shishito are seared and roasted peppers, which were spicy but good. the tempura was amazing with this black truffle alioli that i wanted to drizzle on everything!\n\nthen came chicken gyoza, which was so tender on top of pumpkin puree. before we knew it they were bringing out rolls, one tuna and one with fresh crab. i was starting to feel full, when all of a sudden came the miso <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> and beef tenderloin skewers. they were served with this <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark> that i haven't been able to stop thinking about since.the kernels are the size of quarters!  and i didn't even get to mention the nice cocktail list until now, so you know the food was good.\n\nall in all it was one of the best meals i've had in a really long time. they also had a similar sized spread for my friend who is a vegetarian and graciously agreed to go with us.", 
            "peruvian, brazilian, japanese fusion eats....\n\nlocated in the palazzo, i enjoyed everything here except the ramen.  \n\nvibe is nice, <mark>Uni</mark> artwork displayed, staff was attentive.  prices are a bit high and the portions are small (unless you get an entree, which looked like a decent size from what we saw at our neighbor's table) but it's vegas and the food is at least delicious!  i liked how clean the food tasted (except the ramen) and i didn't feel heavy or greasy after.  just content and happy! \n\nnay\n* <mark>Berkshire Pork Belly</mark> ramen- flavor was kinda blah, noodles under al dente, yah this was just not working and it was 18 bucks.  fail.  don't order ramen here, i\"m thinking it's just not the place for it?\n\nyay\n*raspberry mojito....loved it!\n*yellowtail jalape\\u00f1o and lemongrass 14.00---delicious with a nice kick to the sauce...4 pieces of yellowtail that melt in your mouth.  \n*kanpachi yuzu, sea salt, black truffle oil 17.00--this fish is a yellowtail that melts in your mouth, great sauce.  4 pieces.\n*<mark>Whole Squid</mark> lemon aioli 9.00--this was good but nothing wow\n*<mark>Hamachi Kama</mark> key lime and su-shoyu 12.00- loved.  4 pieces.\n*<mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> and miso-16.00----this was my fave.  flavor was great and the <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> just melts in your mouth.  two skewers plus some <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark> that looks like the hominy from pozole.\n*bobo brazil* <mark>Seared W<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> Beef</mark>, avocado, kaiware, shiso, red onion, chimichurri- 17.00---first time having beef in my sushi and it was good. regular size role,  great combo in my mouth.", 
            "dinner here completely blew away my expectations.  i expected corporate lackluster service, dishes and an over hyped vegas restaurant.  i was glad to be proven wrong.  \n\na sushisamba was short lived in dallas and now i can see why...this would never fit in dallas.  a very lively restaurant at the back end of the palazzo shops.  once seated the very charismatic server explained that the menu, influenced by japanese, brazilian and peruvian cuisine, is designed to be shared by the table.  definitely an odd sounding combination of countries for a menu but it worked out well.  peru and brazil are heavy on the meats, and with peru having an asian influence in their culture, it made perfect sense to fuse the three together. \n\nwhen dining with a large group here it can be very confusing as to what should be ordered with a shared menu concept.  someone at the table should take charge of the ordering or ask your server to lead the way.  we relied on our server to guide us through.  he listened to our likes and dislikes a delivered a wonderful sushi platter.  the rolls were small but great flavor.  we enjoyed it so much we ordered a second platter.  try the samba roll...lobster and mango served with a curry peanut sauce.  still hungry we ventured to the peruvian side of the menu and ordered the anticuchos served with <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark>.  a sweet and heavy starch corn, much different that what we have in states.  the skewered meat was very sweet and tender.  next were the fried mushrooms...a recommendation from the server.  these were outstanding...deep rich flavor fried in tempura.  this sounds like a lot of food but it is not.  i left quite hungry but satisfied with the quality of food and service we received.\n\nfor as busy as they were, the server did not skip a beat.  the food was absolutely delicious.  the restaurant can get pretty loud if you catch it later in the evening.  with this type of shared menu the bill can jump pretty fast.", 
            "i like this place. came here with 2 of my girl friends for happy hour on a thursday night and sat at the bar. our bartender homer was great! he kept the drinks coming and took care of our food orders. as we kept getting drunk, he entertained us with his bartending tricks and knowledge of giant <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark>. haha, we were impressed! everything we tried on happy hour was really good, especially the calamari. we ordered a lot of stuff, but the calamari really stood out. i also remember getting the shishito peppers, but they were okay, i've had better in ny. \n\nall in all, a great experience, i'd love to come here again!",

            "my favorite thing about this restaurant is the option of having a \"custom menu.\" for a flat per person fee, you can ask your waiter (ours was max, who was incredibly attentive and friendly) to order your food for you. as a restaurant with three kitchens (japanese, brazillian & peruvian, don't quote me on that last one), the diversity of dishes you can consume is great. \n\nevery time a dish was brought out for us, max would sit down for a couple seconds and explain each dish. it was really fun not knowing what came out next! for about $70/person (with tip) we got:\n\ndumplings and ceviche\nfour types of sashimi\n<mark>Peruvian Corn</mark> & grilled miso <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>\nalbacore tuna roll & <mark>El Topo</mark> roll\nbraised <mark>Duck Breast</mark> with japanese mushrooms\n\nall of which were amazing. do the \"custom menu.\" it's what makes this place <mark>Uni</mark> and fun!",

            "this is my favorite sushi fusion restaurant!  i have been to all their locations: vegas, chicago, nyc x2, miami, and even tel aviv.  i love each and everyone and am always left satisified.  being from la, i make it a priority each time i am in one of these cities to go to sushi samba.  i always get the same staple items: <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark>, shishito peppers, yellow tail taquitos, <mark>Neo Tokyo</mark> roll, and random other things i am in the mood for.  on top of their amazing food, i love their drinks.  i'm a huge mojito lover and they have one of the best mojitos i have ever had.  the service is always great and the atmosphere is always fun!  great place to go when in vegas.  music was also amazing.", 
            "we celebrated my birthday this year at sushisamba and it was exceptional. the best way to enjoy the menu here is to ask the waiter order the food for you. \n\nif you give them a set $$ amount that you want to spend they really stay within that figure and help you enjoy a variety of their dishes. more than you probably would if you tried to attempt on your own. \n\nstarting off the meal was a trio of veggie dishes including <mark>Green Bean Tempura</mark> with black truffle oil. happiness. we all loved that and ended up dipping everything we could into the truffle oil.\n\nfor the main course we had a selection of 5 different meats with a variety of dipping sauces including two types of chimichurri, one red and one green. the red had more of a vinegar flavor to it. different than <mark><mark>Osetra Caviar Imperial 20g</mark> 20g</mark> still delicious.\n\nsides included collard greens and <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark>. \n\nas a last course we were given 3 large cut rolls of sushi including the <mark>El Topo</mark>. a must if you want to experience salmon and crispy onions together. very different and quite delicious. \n\nobviously we had cocktails as it was my birthday, so my sister and i both ordered the chu cumber \"chu-tini\" and it was beyond. anything with elderflower in it is refreshing and light and makes me want to jump on a plane to the most lazy, tropical destination possible.\n\nthe waiter also threw in a sparkling (literally) coco duo dessert for my birthday. \n\nservice was great and we were all a very happy group by the time we headed out to see jabbawokeez!!", 
            "food was very good and <mark>Uni</mark>.  yellowtail taquitos, sepia robata and <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark> were distinct highlights.  ambiance and service left something to be desired, though.  the room, while interesting was very noisy with tables right on top of each other making discreet conversation a chore.  the waitress didn't bother explaining the menu or offering suggestions other than a quick listing of specials.  despite ordering at least 6 dishes, all the food arrived at the same time.  so much for pacing the meal!\n\nwe were done our dinner in 40 minutes and feeling rushed by the staff were eager to leave.  would return for lunch or appetizers but nt again for a leisurely meal.", 
            "it was a good experience to try something new in sushi, but there was nothing that really stood out in taste that would make me return. we took a lot of the server's recommendations for popular items like the specialty dishes <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> with <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark> and yellowtail taquitos served like tapas, which were both good. the <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark> was ok, but didn't seem to have a complimenting taste with the <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>. we let the server know and he brought out some <mark>Purple Potato Mash</mark> just to try something different and it was better than the corn. \n\nthe service was great. our server was very knowledgeable about the food, how it was prepared and the types of sake that was offered. we enjoyed 4 different <mark>Sake</mark>, which was more enjoyable than the sushi. \n\nif you want to feel like you ate a lot, stick with mostly rolls... the rice will help fill you up.\n\ntypical price for food in lv... $$$... although i didn't think we ordered that much and the cost was just short of the 200 mark for two.\n\ngood brazilian/peruvian fusion... but if i had a choice between this and <mark><mark>Osetra Caviar Imperial 20g</mark> 20g</mark>... obviously traditional.", 
            "huge fan of this place - try to get here anytime i'm in vegas or nyc.  fish quality is excellent and the mix of japanese and brazilian is an interesting twist that goes beyond the standard asian fusion locales.\n\nopt for the omakase (pick a price range with your server), sit back and enjoy the creations they bring through. make sure it comes with <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark> - can't miss side dish\n\nsome favorites\n\n-<mark>Half Maine Lobster</mark> taquitos\n-miso marinated chilean <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>\n-ribeye robata\n-<mark>Samba Strip</mark> roll\n\nalso a perfect place for groups - particularly if you're looking for a fun place to hit up before going out (xs, tryst, tao all very close).",

            "i celebrated my birthday here and was looking forward to trying the wonderful looking food i've seen posted. i even picked out the most popular items (of course, according to yelp) and took my server's recommendations. however, i expected my taste buds to have a party that night, and it fell a little short.\n\noverall, it was a good dinner. service was impeccable. from beginning to end, their staff worked perfectly together to make sure we enjoyed our experience. water were always refilled, our emptied plates were cleared immediately, yet they didn't hover or rush us. very friendly. we really couldn't have asked for a better wait staff to serve us.\n\nwhat did we order?\n\ncrispy taquitos - yellowtail & lobster\nrib-eye robata skewers\nmiso marinated chilean <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> w/ purple sweet mashed potatoes\n<mark>Peruvian Corn</mark>\n<mark>Samba Strip</mark> roll\nbobo brazil roll\nrosca - donuts\n\nthe best tasting dishes for us was of course the chilean <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>. it was good enough that we were a bit disappointed that it was such a small serving size. two small skewers. <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark> was also a hit. however, the sushi rolls were well presented, but lacked much in flavor. the rib-eye and taquitos were decent, but as i reiterate, all pretty to look at, yet nothing came close to being a wow.\n\nsetting is very nice, the restaurant is nice set up to accommodate large parties as well as couples. bar serves food and offer happy hour drinks till 7pm on weekdays. \n\ni definitely appreciated the complimentary birthday dessert, the coco duo, which was sweet and yummy. photos are available of all items i listed here. \n\n3 stars for now, however i'd definitely give sushi samba another try. maybe the wow will come later...", 
            "i flipping love sushisamba. i've been here 3 times and it's just been incredible. this most recent trip, we were a group of 9 girls for a bachelorette party. we had lucked out by getting reservations the day of and they didn't make us wait. i thought they seated us in a weird spot...but no, our reservations were just so early, the place wasn't that full, but the table ended up being fine.\n\nwe decided to do the omakase style for around $50/person. they brought out the cocktail tree with 9 glasses of the samba juice which was incredible and such a great way for them to start wooing us, haha. \n- first course: fried green beans with truffle aioli (my fave!), grilled jalepenos (big hit!), and edamame.\n- second course: fish tacquitos (loved the shell, very crispy), a mushroom tacquito & large salad for the vegetarian, and pork pot stickers (good not great). \n- third course: the famed chilean <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> skewers (melt.in.your.mouth), <mark>Scallop</mark> with like a chimichurri sauce (delicious), and the <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark> (so <mark>Uni</mark>). \n- fourth course: meat/mushroom coconut milk \"curry\" (i hate coconut milk, and this was the one dish that we didn't make a considerable dent in...and they don't serve rice with this! weird).\n- fifth course: sushi. there were 3 different fish sushi rolls (salmon, tuna, and something else) and then 3 vegetarian (avocado, cucumber, and sweet potato--sweet potato was my fave!). they then brought out the dessert for my friend, which was comp'd which was nice.\n\nin my opinion, i felt like the chef prepared way too many fish dishes for this particular group because we had a vegetarian, we had someone who was allergic to shellfish, and we had 3 people who didn't like fish...and yet, we got a lot of fish. i think a lot of people go to sushisamba and expect sushi...but it's fushion, it's not <mark><mark>Osetra Caviar Imperial 20g</mark> 20g</mark>. i would definitely recommend doing the omakase style to start out--you can do it for $30-$75 per person and it's really fun. i rate it 4 stars because i think they should be more creative for vegetarians--vegetarians eat more than mushrooms :) but the service is great and the food is amazing. definitely one of my most consistent favorite places in vegas.",

            "sushi samba in l.v is a great looking place, with pretty good food.  not much of a \"peruvian\" flavor going on except for the <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark> and anticuchos.  our waitress who said she was from miami seemed to be preoccupied and did not sell us on her recommendations.., she was so preoccupied that it took her a long time to stop by our table again and notice that we were ready to order more of the over priced sushi.",

            "this is what a fusion restaurant should be: a brilliant amalgamation of the best flavours of japanese, peruvian, and brazilian cuisines and cocktails, wrapped up into one delightfully fun venue. i'd go back to vegas and the venetian for another bite here, that's for sure!\n\ni started off with the chu-cumber cocktail (from the \"japan cocktails\" sec'n), which is made of: shochu (the other japanese distilled spirit, aside from sake--a pretty good alternative to vodka, if i say so myself), hendricks gin, elderflower liqueur, and freshly muddled cucumber. refreshing, light, just a tad sweet. very good.\n\nwe then tried a bit of everything... <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark> (love those giant kernels), a few small plates (crispy yellowtail tacquitos--spicy aji panca sauce and lime? yes, please), and a \"large plate\" a.k.a. entree. so, there's this cool long bar area in the middle of the restaurant, where you can perch yourself and eat/drink more casually... and the guys sitting next to us at the bar were sushisamba regulars and highly recommended the chilean <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> for one of our large plate selections. because i like you all, i'll echo the suggestion. so. good. so. tasty. so. tender.\n\ni think it's a great restaurant with a vibrant vibe, and a delicious menu to boot. i already recommended it once to someone else who ended up going to vegas a few weeks after i did, and they loved it, too. definitely a bit pricey, but what do you expect when you're smack dab in the middle of the shops at the palazzo? at least the quality matches the price!", 
            "i had eaten at the sushisamba in dallas a while back and really enjoyed the food, so i was looking forward to the las vegas location to see if it lived up to my food memories.  we had reservations for 9:00pm after the las vegas marathon so my runner friends could get a nice recovery meal that wasn't too heavy.  and that wasn't too far away from their hotel!\n\nwe were seated right away, and the vibe of this restaurant was really fun and funky- dark and romantic but with lots of good music.  we decided to split a bunch of small plates which ended up being perfect.  we started with the crispy yellowtail taquitos which were so delicious, but small enough that they left me wanting more!  the tempura mushrooms were light and flavorful with just the right amount of crispiness.  the chicken skewers were yum but the highlight of the meal was the <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> skewers.  i had these in dallas and they were every bit as delicious as i remembered.  love the <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark> too.  normally each order of skewers comes with 2, which would have led to a caveman-style meat fight between the 3 of us, but our server was kind enough to suggest we add a third skewer to the order so we all got to try.  great service on her part.\n\nwe also had 2 of their special sushi rolls- the pacific roll and the green envy.  both were very good and tasted very <mark>Uni</mark>, as opposed to a lot of \"special rolls\" you find out there that are just bigger and they charge more for.\n\nall in all, i was very pleased with this meal and would definitely like to go back in the future... but there's so many places to try in vegas that its hard to commit!",

            "my girlfriend and i stayed at the venetian and came here after watching cirque du soliel: zarkana at aria on 05-11-14. i found this restaurant on yelp before we came. i absolutely love sushi and she hates it. we both love texas de brazil so i figured a good compromise would be a churrascaria crossed with a sushi bar so we picked sushi samba. i always like to find the most expensive roll at sushi bars and try it so i picked the s\\u00c3o paulo for $24. it had <mark>Scallop</mark>, masago, red onion, tuna, salmon, shrimp, yellowtail, avocado, truffle, hacho miso soy, chive oil inside. to be honest the red onion over powered the flavor of every other ingredient and kind of ruined it for me. this is coming from someone that loves onions too. if i come back i'll probably ask them to cut that out when i order. i also ordered a generic <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> roll. for our two sharable sides we ordered <mark>Purple Potato Mash</mark> and <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark>. the two sides were the best thing at this restaurant. the <mark>Purple Potato Mash</mark> had a rich buttery taste and creamy texture that melted in my mouth. the <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark> had a perfect amount of sweetness and the texture was lightly firm just the way i like. the real downside of the meal though is that my girlfriend decided to order the <mark>Berkshire Pork Belly</mark> rather than the <mark>Lamb Chop</mark> she was thinking about. i asked if she was sure she wanted that and she said yes. i neglected to mention to her that <mark>Berkshire Pork Belly</mark> is literally a seared section of fat. she was not pleased, but didn't want to order anything else when her food arrived. my girlfriend was actually quite content with the <mark>Purple Potato Mash</mark> and <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark>. overall the experience was pretty good except for the group of 3 drunk russian speaking call girls (assuming) seated next to us that were intent on yelling over the music the entire time they were there instead of leaning in to hear one another. but, hey if you aren't hearing a drunk person screaming in another language next to you at most of the places you're at then you aren't experiencing vegas the right way. ha!", 
            "came in on sunday (5/25) to dine with my family for my aunt mary's birthday. our server michael came over right away to greet us and offer us a cocktail & wine list. he recommended the cucumber cocktail. the drink was absolutely fantastic.. three of us ended up ordering it. he provided us with a menu tour and made some recommendations for a family style dinner. we decided upon three of his recommendations.. the ribeye (seared to perfection) came out as a first course with a side of mushrooms on a steaming hot skillet. the juices in each were delicious and i could tell my family was blown away. the next course was the neo toyko roll, the lima roll, and a side of <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark>. we were getting full but michael surprised my aunt mary with a happy birthday pop-rocks cake pop and a samba split to share. thank you michael from the bottom of my heart. you are truly an asset to this company, and you made the entire experience the reason why i continue and will always continue to be a sushi samba fanatic. thank you :)", 
            "\"professor in the mist\"\n\npretty brown legs moved her quickly about the room, her tight black skirt barely hiding what lay beneath. eyewear gave her a professorial look, high heels a come hither look. yet it was the direct and patient manner in which she explained the menu items to my father that sealed her as the total package for me. i wish i remembered this fine creature's name but, alas, i was much too smitten to remember such a detail.\n\ndad ordered his usual scotch and mom and i opted for plain water. as we looked over the fare--a japanese/south american type blend--i kept stealing looks at the professor. she caught me a few times but neither of us cared. both of us smiled, in fact. it was an old game played by many throughout time, usually with far more success than ever attained by yours truly. that aside, the dining room was darkly lit, with a sushi bar in back and bar in front. a raucous group of tuxedo wearing party boys were slamming shots on the stools but eventually simmered down. perhaps one of the uber hawt barmaids had mentioned their over exuberance and they'd relented.\n\nanyway, after smooth as silk tutoring from the professor my dad finally settled on <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>(miso) and <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark> with a side of <mark>Roasted Seasonal Vegetables</mark>. mom went with a single samba roll which contained <mark>Half Maine Lobster</mark>, mango, tomato, chive, crispy rice, soy paper and peanut curry. and as for me, i wasn't in the mood for seafood so i asked for chicken teriyaki(samba style) with <mark>Purple Potato Mash</mark> potatoes. \n\nthe verdict?\n\nperhaps everything was fine. i never really know when with my parents. their company is somewhat like being immersed in fine mist after a few drinks. you can sort of see and understand what's going on, but not very clearly, which means you occasionally misread what's actually occurring. to wit: dad liked his fish(but he picked the restaurant so he would have liked whatever slop they put in front of him). mom said her lobster roll was good(but she never says negative things until years after the fact. kind of like her own statute of limitations if you will). and me? i always kind of defer to their mindset when in their company so i think my chicken and potatoes were good, although for something touted on the menu as a large plate i wish there had been more bird and buds.\n\neventually the professor laid our check on the table, and dad swiped it up before i could, although i must confess it was a lame and slow attempt on the part of my right hand. he gave his usual 15% tip and we departed sushisamba--which by the way is located off the shopping section of the palazzo hotel/casino. \n\ni guess we might have had a nice time there(i can't really be sure) but this much i do know: mist or no mist, the professor in high heels forever has my heart in her grasp....",

            "everytime i stay at the palazzo, i must eat at sushi samba.  although it's definitely on the pricier side, it's really worth the money.  and hey, you're in vegas, and you can't be cheap in vegas.  when ordering, you have two options: order off the preset menu or let the chefs create a sampling for you at the price you want.  because this restaurant is a fusion of mainly japanese and brazilian, they have many different chefs creating many different things.  although i tried both, i prefer choosing from the preset menu. this way i don't get something i don't particularly enjoy.  \n\nout of what i've tried so far, my favorites are the s\\u00e3o paulo roll, the <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> antichucho, and the garlic butter <mark>Scallop</mark>.  the s\\u00e3o paulo roll is a wonderful combination of <mark>Scallop</mark>, tuna, salmon, yellowtail, shrimp, red onion, masago, avocado, truffle (!!!), and chive oil.  the <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> has a miso glaze and comes with <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark>.  the <mark>Scallop</mark> are a bit more special because they aren't on the menu.  but they're basically their <mark>Broiled Peruvian Bay Scallop</mark> on a half shell, smothered in this delicious garlicky butter reduction.  can't wait to come back and try some other things on the menu!", 
            "this is a review of their happy hour (4-7pm and 11pm until close).\n\nthe skinny: spent $50+ on sub par peruvian influenced japanese food (2.5), service: was slow when we wanted to leave (3) value: seeing as there was only 1 dish out of 8 that we would get again, we won't likely be back (3).\n\nwe were excited to see that they had a happy hour menu while meandering through the venetian properties. we thought great! if the food is good during happy hour, we'll come back another time and try their other regularly priced dishes. \n\nso we ordered 8 out of 10 ($6)items on their happy hour menu. of the 8, we'd probably get only 1 item again. the rest was pretty mediocre considering how much they charge for each dish and the level of cuisine.\n\nwe should have known. i mean when the first dish - yellowtail tiradito - came out, i knew it wasn't going to be good. the thinly sliced 2 pieces of yellowtail were drowning in a pepper sauce. i really couldn't taste the flavor of the fish at all. definitely not well balanced. \n\n<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> (3 pieces) with kabocha puree was okay. although the beef had a wonderful smokiness to it, the gyoza were disappointingly undersalted even after dunking in a good amount of soy sauce. the kabocha squash was relatively flavorless which surprised me after reading reviews about this dish.\n\nchicken anticuchos (2 skewers)were not bad although they weren't particularly memorable either. the meat, slightly grilled/charred, was not crispy enough texturally although it was adequately seasoned.\n\neggplant anticuchos with a side of <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark> was okay. i dug the slightly herbaceous kick of the chiffonated mint or basil, cutting the sweetness of the soy based sauce. however the eggplant was a tinge on the tougher side and needed to be roasted with more oil to give it a better texture.  the <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark> is definitely not one of my favorite foods. potato-like in taste and texture, the chef was able to infuse some acidity to make it more flavorful. it was more palatable with the hit of citrus but still, nothing i needed to try again.\n\nthe sushi (veggie kun - kind of like futomaki, ezo roll - meager amounts of salmon/asparagus with a ton of panko breadcrumbs mixed in = bad mouth feel, and <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> - acceptable but nothing exciting) was the most lackluster portion of our meal. considering rice composes about 50% of sushi, it was highly disappointing to find it overly mushy and over seasoned. it kind of ruined it for me. factor in the high rice to filling ratio, i cannot recommend any sushi dish made here. this is rather unfor<mark>Tuna</mark> because sushi comprises at least a significant portion of the menu.\n\nthe only highlight of the meal was the <mark>Salt and Pepper Squid</mark>. melt-in-your-mouth tender pieces of squid with a delicate batter, this was the one dish that the hubs and i truly enjoyed.\n\nfood service was surprisingly and perhaps questionably prompt. there was a small gap in service with our last dish but it wasn't too bad. it was unfor<mark>Tuna</mark> that the bar service was slower than expected and easily overwhelmed. after our meal, we just wanted to get the check processed and go. however, a loud obnoxious group of women (aka the skanky looking anti-milfs who obviously collected club wristbands) completely commandeered her attention with to go orders. the two other bartenders were milling around but did not help her. so the hubs had to endure some random, potentially contagious woman's behind rubbing against his left leg while she took orders from other groups of people. he was highly grumpy after being mauled and ignored.\n\nin reality, this joint rates about a 2.5 however i rounded up to a three based on the fact that there was 1 dish which was truly outstanding. however, given our experience, we are not likely to return. 3 starred review.",

            "best dinner experience during a recent week in vegas - equal credits due to food, company, service and the ambiance.\ni loved my lemon samurai - light enough so i could have a perfectly lucid conversation and remember all of it, yet not trivial enough to pass off as a mocktail! the vegetarian roll doesn't merit too much reflection, but the plaintains and <mark>Coconut Rice</mark> lent a nice latin infusion to the otherwise bland menu.\nthe ambiance is mighty chic without being uber pretentious like some of the other palazzo restaraunts. which means the crowd is about as \"normal\" as you could get in vegas! not abnormal is the pricetag - expensive certainly, but heck, i'd rather savor a memorable dinner than watch my money vanish on a table on the casino floor!\noverall, great place to linger, lounge and see and be seen.", 
            "if you are not interested in being open-minded to an array of fusion tapas featuring japanese, brazilian, and peruvian inspired palettes...then this is place not for you. if however you are interested in being more cultured in regards to your typical sushi restaurant, then you may continue reading.\n\nsushi samba is a great restaurant to taste a blend of very <mark>Uni</mark> flavors...the menu is not your typical one but rest assured, your server is happy to answer any of your questions. the server started off by asking us if we've been there before...i have so i said yes. if i would have said now, he would have prefaced our meal with a story of the restaurants background i.e. stylings of food, etc. i know this because i overheard another server doing it. \n\nwith any tapas joint it is always easy to over order...and me, my bro, and his fiance did just that. here is what we got.\n\n-shishito (grilled peppers): the sea salt adds a great flavor, the peppers themselves are literally grilled\n- <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> robata: a small portion of robata grilled <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> cooked exactly how i wanted\n- <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> and miso swewers: recommended by our server, these skewers were off the hook!!!! melted like butter in my mouth...the miso flavor was out of this world.\n-<mark>Miso Soup</mark>: the only difference between this soup and the others...they add cilantro\n-<mark>Coconut Rice</mark>: the side order of rice could actually feed 2 people. we ordered 2 not knowing this. the coconut flavor is not at all overpowering...i've gotta learn how to make this rice!\n-green envy roll: yum!!! salmon and tuna rolled with some crunchies to make this fine number\n-<mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> roll: not as spicy as i thought it would be but still yummy\n-<mark>Rio Grande</mark> (5 meats): this meal on its own came with black beans, collard greens, rice, 5 different meats, and 3 sauce pairings. wow! you need to order this...there was 3 of us and we couldnt finish but the options were great. the sauces were extremely complementary.\n\nsure our meal came out to $172.69 pre gratuity for 3 people but for the service, quality and presentation of the food, and the ambiance...the price seems quite fitting.", 
            "the ambiance of the restaurant was breathtaking as 3 fellow diners and i walked in. we had made reservations a few hours in advance on a busy saturday night (the night before 4th of july) so we understood that it would be a few minutes of a wait. while we waited, we sat near the waiting/bar area and our to-be waitress asked us if we wanted to order drinks. we ordered drinks while we waited for our table and our waitress brought them to us in the lounge area we were sitting in. i got the strawberry-tini which was really fruity and yummy. \n\nwe got seated after about 10 minutes. i will admit, the menu seemed slightly pricey but it's vegas and you can't expect restaurants not to be pricey. i ordered the <mark>Neo Tokyo</mark> roll and it came with 8 small pieces but was the best sushi i've ever had! for $15, it wasn't bad at all because i also decided to order a side of <mark>Coconut Rice</mark> which was delicious and only $5. the drink did ring up to be $12 but overall it wasn't bad for the great dining experience. my fellow diners loved their dishes as well. 2 of them ordered a 4-course dinner for $50, which is customized to your liking based on what preferences and allergies you tell the waitress you have and she kind of surprises you. the last diner ordered the kobe beef sushi and he enjoyed it a lot. it came with delicately sliced raw kobe beef wrapped around the sushi which looked amazing.\n\noverall a very fun dining experience!", 
            "this restaurant was really crackin when we came on a sat night for a friend's bday dinner.  you'll definitely need reservations for peak times (ie dinner on a weekend).  it's japanese, brazilian and peruvian cuisine all in one.  if you like japanese w/ a twist, this is the spot to go to.  but beware, for some reason, it was really smokey (prob cause of the brazilian meats they were cooking) and overwhelmed the place (i don't think their blower was working that night).  nonetheless, the restaurant has a hip vibe to it and along with that came much pricier menu options.  we had a large party of 10 and ordered quite a few things from the menu, but i'll just mention the ones that made our group go gaga over:\n\n1) chicken teriyaki ~ samba style <mark>Organic Chicken</mark>, <mark>Purple Potato Mash</mark>, aji amarillo, crispy onion - the chicken was to die for esp with the teriyaki sauce along with the <mark>Purple Potato Mash</mark> (yummm)\n2) <mark>Coconut Rice</mark> - a nice twist to rice and vegetarians\n3) <mark>Rio Grande</mark> w/ a choice of three meats (grilled hanger steak, ribeye, pork tenderloin, chorizo, ling\\u00fci\\u00e7a with malagueta pepper oil and chimichurri) - friends had the hanger steak, ribeye, and i think the pork and came w/ a variety of dipping sauces.  let's just say they were very satisfied.\n\noverall, it's a fun place, but gets a bit crazy and hectic.  large parties are better suited for a booth table vs. something in the middle of the restaurant where we were seated (seemed like we were in the way).  they are also well known for having a large saki menu, although we didn't get to try it out that time.  just more of a reason to come back.", 
            "this was the best!!! the food was freakin awesome! our waitress was really flirty & friendly. we had her create our menu. she made great recommendations & coordinated a great fusion of everything from appetizers & entrees. everything tasted sooo delicious. i loved the sushi, <mark>Coconut Rice</mark> and the mini taco. it took awhile for the food to come but the ambiance was entertaining & it was worth waiting for.",

            "sorry, sushisamba, but what happens in vegas, certainly does not stay in vegas.\n\ni was recently on a business trip to the sin city and ate at sushisamba three separate occasions. the first two were great experiences, but sadly third time wasn't a charm. it completely ruined my entire experience.\n\nwhile the sushi was good (certainly not the best i've ever had) i was appalled when my co-worker found a hair in his roll during my third meal there. as soon as he did, we notified our waitress and her reply was \"can i get you another roll?\" so he ordered a new one. then she asks, \"is it blonde? because if it is, it may have been mine but don't worry i showered this morning.\"\n\nyelpers, i kid you not.\n\noh gee thanks! now i can rest assured knowing your dead skin cells that are possibly floating around my stomach were at least clean.\n\ni about died - but instead stuck to eating <mark>Coconut Rice</mark> (i didn't dare touch a roll). a few minutes later..... another hair.\n\nthis time i stormed up and demanded the manager who questioned us the entire time and seemed entirely unconvinced that there was any hair in either of the rolls. i am sorry, but when a customer is showing you a hair in their food, you should probably not question it. she then says, \"i just have to check because sometimes it isn't hair. sometimes it is just small shards of chopsticks that look like blonde hair.\"\n\nare you kidding me? so now, i should be happy with the fact that it might not be the waitress' clean blonde hair, but instead a shard of chopstick that could pierce my esophagus?\n\ni have never experienced a more ridiculous restaurant situation in my life. needless to say i left with the worst impression of the entire restaurant, which is a pity considering the first two occasions went well. good luck to whoever dines at this place - but don't worry, at least the hair in your sushi roll is probably clean.",

            "i should mention the one star rating is primarily based on two factors:\n\n1- the <mark>Kumamoto Oysters</mark> they served were bad.  like old and spoiled bad.  it took half the remainder of my dinner to get the taste out of my mouth from one of them.\n2 - no brazilian beer.   i ordered a brazilian lager and 10 minutes later was told they were out of it.  i then ordered a south american pilsner and they were out of that.  i then decided not to drink.  after mentioning the oyster quality to our server, the manager asked what they could do.  well, they found that pilsner they were out of.\n\nthe sushi was decent, but not exceptional. the brazilian fish stew was rather boring, the <mark>Coconut Rice</mark>, beans and quinoa about average and the grilled eggplant not so good.  i was hoping for the eggplant that sensei can deliver.\n\ntables are very small for the larger number of dishes and it's extremely loud.\n\ni guess i shouldn't have expected much from a brazilian-peruvian-japanese fusion.  i haven't been to peru, but feel that brazilian cuisine is about as good as  english food.\n\nperhaps i would have liked their <mark>Seared W<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> Beef</mark>, but at $32/oz. and the seeming lack of kitchen talent, i decided not to try it.", 
            "i came for a bachelorette party last week on friday night around 11pm. my review is probably (ok definitely) biased because i was in such a bad mood at having to wait until 11pm to eat dinner. however, as you might imagine, 5 girls using one bathroom getting ready to go out in vegas is a production equal to cirque de solei that takes upward of 3 hours. but whatever we finally made it after a 15 minute, mile long cab ride down the strip from the cosmo to the palazzo hotel.  the restaurant was super dark (why don't they turn some lights on?) with huge tvs which were super loud. per the usual at many \"sceney\" type restaurants you could barely here the people across the table from you. \n\nwe got seated no problem as the restaurant was dead except for two or three big groups getting wasted in booths and a few lonely looking stragglers at the bar. our server was friendly but seemed to constantly be in a rush, although to go where i do not know. there seemed to be a ton of bus boys but very few wait staff. he could probably sense our frustration so he promptly brought out a wrought iron tree full of pink drinks. whether or not they had liquor was the only question (answer: not enough.) so we got a range of drinks, the best of which was a cucumber lime martini with vodka. after the night's beginning, i opted with straight vodka and diet coke.\n\nfor food we got a lot. some  memorable dishes were the <mark>Neo Tokyo</mark> roll with tuna which was solid, <mark>Heirloom Tomato Salad</mark> with sweet cilantro dressing, <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark>, <mark>Mushroom Tobanyaki</mark>, and sweet <mark>Coconut Rice</mark> side. my fave dish of all was the <mark>Heirloom Tomato Salad</mark> which was pricey but enough to share between 3 people. the rock shrimp was good but cliched, same as you would get anywhere else. the <mark>Mushroom Tobanyaki</mark> was interesting but not to my taste.  sadly we did not get dessert. \nin conclusion, i can definitely say i hope i will never be back with another bachelorette party, although i would not mind returning otherwise.",

            "i have eaten here a lot for dinner throughout the years. we were in search of a great lunch. we found it here at sushisamba. we had the perfect lunch to get us through a busy day in vegas. we had the seared w<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> small plate (always my favorite-i always order this), <mark>Coconut Rice</mark>, the <mark>Samba Strip</mark> roll and the yuzu tart cheesecake. everything was delicious and had great presentation. i loved that is was not loud and overcrowded at lunch. we had just the perfect lunch. the specialty drinks are a must. i can't remember the names, but one that had japanese whiskey in it with pineapple was absolutely delicious. i highly recommend it. the general manager, jeremy made our lunch extra special with a tasting of a new dish of cooked <mark>Scallop</mark> with a pesto sauce that was dynamite and the miso marinated <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> dish. everything was amazing and not heavy. the <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> to our surprise was our favorite dish, but there wasn't anything we tried that wasn't delicious. it was so moist and had so much flavor. i love this menu because it is diverse and there is something for everyone's specific taste buds and you can easily share if you'd like. my husband really enjoyed the experience here. thank you to jeremy for a great experience along with the wonderful wait staff. if you want a meal that is diverse in flavor and presentation and will leave you full, but not heavy and uncomfortable-this is the perfect place. you get the full package here with great service and delicious food. well worth it."

            "my friends and i were staying at the palazzo and i thought to try sushisamba for my sister's bachelorette dinner.  we made reservations at 10:15pm and upon arrival the bar area and the dining area looked pretty full.  \n\nthe decor was dark and interesting, with black and white classic japanese films airing on a large big screen and some classy art/anime con another wall.  my friend and i had a discussion about how we appreciated the scene.    \n\ntheir menu features a wide array of items: small platters, appertizers, large platters, sushi.   i checked out their menu from the palazzo website prior so i knew what prices to expect.  we started off with a bottle of sake - they have a pretty extensive sake list - and the price was reasonable for a bottle of sake.  \n\ni had ordered the rock fish ($29) and it was prepared very elegantly and was also very very delicious -sweet and moist.  i let my friends sample my dish and everyone really enjoyed it. 2 of my friends ordered the teriyaki chicken ($25) and it wasn't your typical chicken teriyaki - the chicken was served with the bone in and was accompanied with <mark>Purple Potato Mash</mark> potatoes.  i think this was probably my favorite chicken teriyaki dish i have sampled before and the others agreed.  others at the table ordered sushi, ramen, fries, etc.  there were 9 of us and out of the group, it impressed 3 of us (1 person was myself).  i appreciate good quality food and i thought the prices were reasonable - it is las vegas and it is a trendy restaurant in the palazzo so it's expectable for the prices of cuisine.  most restaurants on the las vegas strip are usually typically pricey for the amount of food you receive anyway.  i typically like upscale restaurants.  on the other hand, the other girls at the table complained of hunger and that it was expensive.  they didn't agree that ramen for $18 was worth it - they are used to $5 ramen at a no-thrills restautant.  yes it is only ramen, but it had a delicate lemon grass flavor, it was a decent size, and it is generally a good price for an upscale restaurant.  so this review offers insight for 2 different perspectives.  it was light fare, but perfect for going out to clubs after.  \n\nservice was superb.  our waiter served us well; had friendly casual discussions periodically, and offered to take us into sugarcane - the club.lounge attached to the restaurant.  granted, the club/lounge was empty and only had 2 people dancing, it was a nice gesture and this review is solely based on the restaurant.  \n\nif you appreciate upscale quality food that emerges to be different and <mark>Uni</mark> in a chic environment try sushisamba :)", 
            "i was pleasantly surprised by sushi samba.  it was kind of a last choice for our big bachelorette party of 18 girls.  at first i was like... eh, i can try that in ny.  and you're always taking a gamble with asian fusion.\n\nbut, we knew the bride liked sushi and so we eventually caved.\n\nhere is the breakdown of my experience at samba:\n\ndecor/atmosphere - dark, swank, very appropriate for the occasion.  they sat our party in the back room where no one else was seated.  that was nice.  we had privacy for the first hour or so of our meal.  the air conditioning was cranked up way too high but they said they turned it down.  i don't think they did.  i damn near lost my toes trying to keep blood flowing to the extremities.\n\nservice - friendly, cute staff of slow-talking brazilian boys.  they're good but something tells me they were hired as eye candy rather than for their perfect waiting skills.  as we sat down they asked if we wanted flat or sparkling water - don't you hate when restaurants do that and trick you into buying overpriced bottled water?  i specifically clarified \"tap\" after some of the girls said flat and they still brought out about 7 bottles all opened and ready to pretty much pour straight into our throats.  that was my one big complaint of the night.  oh yeah, and i also asked them to box up some leftovers for us to take, which they never did.\n\nfood - surprisingly yummy.  we had a 7-course pre-fixe which included a shrimp appetizer, organic greens salad with carrot-ginger dressing, giant sushi platter, miso <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>, teriyaki chicken over <mark>Purple Potato Mash</mark> potatoes, beef carpaccio(?), chocolate bread pudding and finally a tres leite (i have no idea what this is but it was delicious). the highlight for me was the <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>.  very similar to a miso black cod or butterfish.  i loved the chicken.  usually, i'm indifferent to teriyaki but it was moist and so <mark>Uni</mark> with the creamy potatoes.  the beef dish was like a beef tataki - very rare (almost raw) and with nice acidity.  desserts did not disappoint at all - i'd say it was actually a highlight of the meal.\n\nwell done, sushi samba.  you were way overpriced but i have to admit i enjoyed myself.", 
            "the only thing preventing me from giving this place 5 stars is the price--which was fairly steep (we spent $50 per person for lunch).  however, the food was fantastic and the menu had lots of interesting items--it's japanese/south american fusion.  \n\ni ordered chicken teriyaki., which was incredibly tender and served on top of these delicious <mark>Purple Potato Mash</mark> potatoes in a tasty sauce.   my companion ordered a variety of sushi and rolls. he was born in japan and is very picky about his sushi, but he was very happy with everything that he ordered.   we defintely will go again.  next time i want to try the plantains!", 
            "overview: \n\ngood food, terrible service and incredibly overpriced even by vegas standards.  this is one to avoid unless you're really desperate for expensive sushi and/or p<mark>Uni</mark> omasake.\n\nfood:\n\nthe food was good.  sushi samba offers a <mark>Uni</mark> but odd blend of japanese and brazillian cooking.  the menu explains that there are japanese people who live in brazil but that doesn't explain how sushi and mashed purple potatoes go together.  \n\nmy wife and i wanted to order eel.  on the menu it said $6 for eel.   at most sushi places an order would be two pieces.  at ss an order is one piece.  i've eaten at some very high end sushi places, none would dare charge this much for eel.  the rest of the fish was similarly overpriced.  rolls with four pieces were hitting $20, it was crazy.\n\nthat said, the eel was pretty good as was everything else i ate.  the oyster,  was good but cost the almost the same as the eel ($4 each).  my main course was a well cooked piece of chicken with an excellent <mark>Purple Potato Mash</mark>.  i tried several other dishes and it was the only one i'd think of ordering again.\n\none veggie friend opted for the omasake and ended up leaving as hungry as he arrived.\n\nservice:\n\nthe service was unbelievably bad on every single level.  our server was nowhere to be found, we literally had to beg her to come back to our table and take our money.  the food came out at a pace unseen before.  some items took over an hour to make.  things like fish, which probably cooked for only five minutes.  sushi took almost as long, even the simple to make stuff.  the waitress came by to explain that things would come out as they're ready because they have three kitchens.  come to think of it, she said that to us at least six times.  maybe they should have one kitchen that functions properly.\n\nat this snails pace the waitress still managed to screw things up, ordering me the most expensive oysters when in fact i had ordered another kind.\n\nall this pales in comparison to my friend who said he was a vegetarian and, at the pleading of the waitress, agreed to \"trust her\" and let her select things he'd eat.  he wasn't a vegan, but a vegetarian.  he ended up with a large plate of vegetables covered in teriaki sauce.  that was his dinner.  how pathetic. \n\natmosphere:\n\nthis place gave me a headache.  there were odd silent film strips running on the walls, insane colors all over the place and the typical loud vegas roar in the background.  of course there are few color palates i can stomach for that length of time.\n\nvalue:\n\nthis place was the worst value of any place i ate on my trip.  i spent $125 for two people and left feeling hungry.  high end sushi places rarely charge the prices this place charges and considering this was a step above \"rock n' roll sushi\" they have no right to be charging these amounts for what are basic items.  \n\nthe friend who ended up with the plate of vegetables still had a $40 bill for himself.", 
            "this restaurant was really crackin when we came on a sat night for a friend's bday dinner.  you'll definitely need reservations for peak times (ie dinner on a weekend).  it's japanese, brazilian and peruvian cuisine all in one.  if you like japanese w/ a twist, this is the spot to go to.  but beware, for some reason, it was really smokey (prob cause of the brazilian meats they were cooking) and overwhelmed the place (i don't think their blower was working that night).  nonetheless, the restaurant has a hip vibe to it and along with that came much pricier menu options.  we had a large party of 10 and ordered quite a few things from the menu, but i'll just mention the ones that made our group go gaga over:\n\n1) chicken teriyaki ~ samba style <mark>Organic Chicken</mark>, <mark>Purple Potato Mash</mark>, aji amarillo, crispy onion - the chicken was to die for esp with the teriyaki sauce along with the <mark>Purple Potato Mash</mark> (yummm)\n2) <mark>Coconut Rice</mark> - a nice twist to rice and vegetarians\n3) <mark>Rio Grande</mark> w/ a choice of three meats (grilled hanger steak, ribeye, pork tenderloin, chorizo, ling\\u00fci\\u00e7a with malagueta pepper oil and chimichurri) - friends had the hanger steak, ribeye, and i think the pork and came w/ a variety of dipping sauces.  let's just say they were very satisfied.\n\noverall, it's a fun place, but gets a bit crazy and hectic.  large parties are better suited for a booth table vs. something in the middle of the restaurant where we were seated (seemed like we were in the way).  they are also well known for having a large saki menu, although we didn't get to try it out that time.  just more of a reason to come back.", 
            "the kids meal is a great deal.  the adult menu is pricey and you will leave hungry unless you spend a lot of money.  we tried <mark>Purple Potato Mash</mark> (good), miso pork ramen $18 (for soup!), <mark>Berkshire Pork Belly</mark> (great if you savor the taste of fat), edamame and <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark>.  it was around 100 bucks - hubby left hungry", 
            "classy. dim. convenient. tons of lcd tvs. great food.\n\ni recommend the 25$ teriyaki chicken. the way sushisamba prepares chicken teriyaki is unlike any restaurant that ive ever been to. i was expecting some cookie cutter skimpy chicken teriyaki. but to my surprise the chicken teriyaki came on top of a pile of <mark>Purple Potato Mash</mark> potatoes and tasted amazing. the chicken was flavored perfectly and.. it melted in my mouth. moist, juicy, tender, man did i enjoy chewing that day. in combination with the mash potatoes makes for a most savory dish. \n\nsushi is also a good option here. sushi<mark>Samba Sushi</mark> comes lightly wrapped in rice rather than how sushi restaurants ordinarily fill their rolls with rice. i liked that. it accentuated the other ingredients such as kobe beef, <mark><mark>Osetra Caviar Imperial 20g</mark> 20g</mark>. we pretty much ordered all the rolls and each one was different from the next. although i cant say i enjoyed the kobe beef one as it was kind of bland. also, i wouldnt recommend the oysters because its quite ordinary.", 
            "one of my favorite places in vegas. it's located in the shoppes area of the venetian near or in the palazzo side. at any rate, no real review because i like it like everyone else, and there's no shortage of people that like this place.\n\ni do have some suggestions though. first of all, make a reservation or show up very early. second, instead of getting lost in the menu -- it's a fusion restaurant so think myriad choice and complexity multiplied by something other than binary -- have the wait staff put together a tapas selection based on their favorites. tell them how adventurous you are else up may end up with little fried crabs you're supposed to eat whole. just sayin. last thing, don't leave without trying the <mark>Purple Potato Mash</mark> potatoes.\n\nit's expensive here especially with drinks - so bring your bankroll, your loan repayment program, your mommy's credit card, or your dish washing skillz.", 
            "it was a good experience to try something new in sushi, but there was nothing that really stood out in taste that would make me return. we took a lot of the server's recommendations for popular items like the specialty dishes <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> with <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark> and yellowtail taquitos served like tapas, which were both good. the <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark> was ok, but didn't seem to have a complimenting taste with the <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>. we let the server know and he brought out some <mark>Purple Potato Mash</mark> just to try something different and it was better than the corn. \n\nthe service was great. our server was very knowledgeable about the food, how it was prepared and the types of sake that was offered. we enjoyed 4 different <mark>Sake</mark>, which was more enjoyable than the sushi. \n\nif you want to feel like you ate a lot, stick with mostly rolls... the rice will help fill you up.\n\ntypical price for food in lv... $$$... although i didn't think we ordered that much and the cost was just short of the 200 mark for two.\n\ngood brazilian/peruvian fusion... but if i had a choice between this and <mark><mark>Osetra Caviar Imperial 20g</mark> 20g</mark>... obviously traditional.", 
            "amazing! \nthe <mark>Purple Potato Mash</mark> potatoes are an absolute must try. everything you try is life changing! \nchef herb stopped by our table and he was so charming a personable! \ni never come to vegas without eating here! \n5 stars is not enough!", 
            "ever since i came here the first time i went to vegas, i've been dying to come back.\n\nthe food is so good!  i thought we just got lucky the first time we came, but as it turns out, everything we've tried on the menu thus far is delicious.\n\nambiance is classy and cool.  it's a nice location within the palazzo hotel with lots of seats.  service was also good, as my water glass was always full despite being very busy on a friday night at midnight.\n\nwe got:\n\n<mark>Moqueca Mista</mark> - shrimp, squid, <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>, coconut milk, roasted cashew, dende oil, chimichurri rice - $29 - http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sushisamba-las-vegas?select=t4jwaobhrbkbp4vr92x4ua#t4jwaobhrbkbp4vr92x4ua\n\nthis thing is the best ever.  creamy thai-style curry taste (hence coconut milk) with the delicate seafood mixed in with bits of crushed cashews, giving the dish great texture.  rice was served within the sauce mixture as shown; the rice soaked up all the sauce, making every morsel divine.  i thought after a while the dish would get too rich-tasting, but somehow i kept gobbling and gobbling until the plate was empty!\n\n<mark>El Topo</mark> sushi roll - salmon, jalape\\u00f1o, shiso leaf, fresh melted mozzerella, crispy onion - $15 (forgot to take a pic; too excited about the <mark>Moqueca Mista</mark>)\n\nvery <mark>Uni</mark> roll with interesting flavors and textures = delicious!\n\nchicken teriyaki - samba style <mark>Organic Chicken</mark>, aji amarillo, <mark>Purple Potato Mash</mark>, crispy onion - $26 (again forgot to take a pic...)\n\nwhen i saw the huge price tag i thought \"wtf?!\", especially for a seemingly simple plate as chicken teriyaki (my friend ordered this one so i had no control).  buttt i'll have to say that it was probably the best teriyaki chicken i've ever had in my life!  super juicy fillets of teriyaki chicken, pan fried (i think) to a crisp.  the sauce was perfect; not too saucy, not too dry, and definitely not overpowering to the dish.\n\nas with all finer dining restaurants, especially on the las vegas strip, i did think the prices were a little inflated.  hence the lack of that final star.  however, probably one of my favorite places to eat while in vegas.  i'll definitely hit it up again on future trips.  they have a good happy hour too (both early evening and late night), so i'll have to take advantage of that next time! :)", 
            "this was our second time here. first was last august for lunch. last night for dinner. totally recommend making reservations, it was busy! we ordered the chicken teriyaki with <mark>Purple Potato Mash</mark>, so yummy. lobster taquitos and <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark> rolls were awesome.",

            "my girlfriend and i stayed at the venetian and came here after watching cirque du soliel: zarkana at aria on 05-11-14. i found this restaurant on yelp before we came. i absolutely love sushi and she hates it. we both love texas de brazil so i figured a good compromise would be a churrascaria crossed with a sushi bar so we picked sushi samba. i always like to find the most expensive roll at sushi bars and try it so i picked the s\\u00c3o paulo for $24. it had <mark>Scallop</mark>, masago, red onion, tuna, salmon, shrimp, yellowtail, avocado, truffle, hacho miso soy, chive oil inside. to be honest the red onion over powered the flavor of every other ingredient and kind of ruined it for me. this is coming from someone that loves onions too. if i come back i'll probably ask them to cut that out when i order. i also ordered a generic <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> roll. for our two sharable sides we ordered <mark>Purple Potato Mash</mark> and <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark>. the two sides were the best thing at this restaurant. the <mark>Purple Potato Mash</mark> had a rich buttery taste and creamy texture that melted in my mouth. the <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark> had a perfect amount of sweetness and the texture was lightly firm just the way i like. the real downside of the meal though is that my girlfriend decided to order the <mark>Berkshire Pork Belly</mark> rather than the <mark>Lamb Chop</mark> she was thinking about. i asked if she was sure she wanted that and she said yes. i neglected to mention to her that <mark>Berkshire Pork Belly</mark> is literally a seared section of fat. she was not pleased, but didn't want to order anything else when her food arrived. my girlfriend was actually quite content with the <mark>Purple Potato Mash</mark> and <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark>. overall the experience was pretty good except for the group of 3 drunk russian speaking call girls (assuming) seated next to us that were intent on yelling over the music the entire time they were there instead of leaning in to hear one another. but, hey if you aren't hearing a drunk person screaming in another language next to you at most of the places you're at then you aren't experiencing vegas the right way. ha!", 
            "\"professor in the mist\"\n\npretty brown legs moved her quickly about the room, her tight black skirt barely hiding what lay beneath. eyewear gave her a professorial look, high heels a come hither look. yet it was the direct and patient manner in which she explained the menu items to my father that sealed her as the total package for me. i wish i remembered this fine creature's name but, alas, i was much too smitten to remember such a detail.\n\ndad ordered his usual scotch and mom and i opted for plain water. as we looked over the fare--a japanese/south american type blend--i kept stealing looks at the professor. she caught me a few times but neither of us cared. both of us smiled, in fact. it was an old game played by many throughout time, usually with far more success than ever attained by yours truly. that aside, the dining room was darkly lit, with a sushi bar in back and bar in front. a raucous group of tuxedo wearing party boys were slamming shots on the stools but eventually simmered down. perhaps one of the uber hawt barmaids had mentioned their over exuberance and they'd relented.\n\nanyway, after smooth as silk tutoring from the professor my dad finally settled on <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>(miso) and <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark> with a side of <mark>Roasted Seasonal Vegetables</mark>. mom went with a single samba roll which contained <mark>Half Maine Lobster</mark>, mango, tomato, chive, crispy rice, soy paper and peanut curry. and as for me, i wasn't in the mood for seafood so i asked for chicken teriyaki(samba style) with <mark>Purple Potato Mash</mark> potatoes. \n\nthe verdict?\n\nperhaps everything was fine. i never really know when with my parents. their company is somewhat like being immersed in fine mist after a few drinks. you can sort of see and understand what's going on, but not very clearly, which means you occasionally misread what's actually occurring. to wit: dad liked his fish(but he picked the restaurant so he would have liked whatever slop they put in front of him). mom said her lobster roll was good(but she never says negative things until years after the fact. kind of like her own statute of limitations if you will). and me? i always kind of defer to their mindset when in their company so i think my chicken and potatoes were good, although for something touted on the menu as a large plate i wish there had been more bird and buds.\n\neventually the professor laid our check on the table, and dad swiped it up before i could, although i must confess it was a lame and slow attempt on the part of my right hand. he gave his usual 15% tip and we departed sushisamba--which by the way is located off the shopping section of the palazzo hotel/casino. \n\ni guess we might have had a nice time there(i can't really be sure) but this much i do know: mist or no mist, the professor in high heels forever has my heart in her grasp....",

            "lunch at sushisamba is the best!  we were promptly seated at a round table with a good view of the whole restaurant.  the restaurant energy is vibrant, full of energy and colorful.  we ordered 2 orders of the 3 kinds of seaweed 'cos we love seaweed!  i love the crunchy pink seaweed, the light green is the common one and the black seaweed was a little coarser.  all were good!  the <mark>Salt and Pepper Squid</mark> arrived - succulent and tender.   next came the <mark>Huancaina Fries</mark> - peru potatoes with queso fresco - delicious!  oh yes!  our favorites were up next:  <mark>Hamachi Kama</mark> - yellowtail fish collar - 2 beautiful pieces charred with a squeeze of key lime and a side of su shohyu sauce - fresh and so tasty!  each one got one <mark>Hamachi Kama</mark> - and that's a lot of fish!  \n\nsuddenly there was break and no food arrived.  we were wondering what happened... then appeared the manager with 2 plates - one dish of <mark>Broiled Peruvian Bay Scallop</mark> (there were 4 in total)  with on one dish and the other a taco with waygu beef for my mum 'cos she's lactose-intolerant.  i was wondering why the waiter had asked us if we had any seashell allergies or any allergies at about 1/3 of the way into our lunch.  now, i know why!!  :o).  the manager explained that he wanted to give us these free appetizers 'cos we were repeat customers!  how generous!  \n\nwe also ordered 2 more rolls - <mark>Samba Strip</mark> - <mark>Half Maine Lobster</mark> - need i say more!  and the lima roll - shrimp and crab.  yummy rolls and the best i've ever had!! \n\nservice was fantastic and we will come back again!", 
            "my wallet was crying and i left hungry.. \nkeep in my this place should be dined at only for the experience and not to get full!\n\nfood: \n1. seaweed appetizer: \nto my surprise when this appetizer was delivered to our table there were three different types. i still think that green jelly looking one taste the best. \n\n2. <mark>Huancaina Fries</mark>: \nthis side dish was super tasty. the fries were actually baby potatoes dressed with a cream sauce and cheese. it was mmm mmm good!.\n\n3. <mark>Samba Strip</mark> roll: \nmy friends and i initially chose this roll because we saw that there was lobster in it. with the roll also came a curry dipping sauce. personally, i liked the roll by itself because the curry  sauce tasted kind of tart/ sour. \n\n4. <mark>Rainbow Dragon</mark> roll: \nthe usual dragon roll, nothing special.\n\n5. carnaval: \nthis was my favorite of all the rolls. the contents of the rolls included: shrimp, avocado, yellowtail. a simple but tasty roll overall. \n\nservice: \nthe waiter came by pretty frequently to refill our waters and ask if we needed anything. \n\nfinal verdict: \nthe fish/ lobster was extremely fresh, but i don't know if i can get over the $$$ prices. definitely a great las vegas dining experience though."

            "my friends and i actually couldn't decide on a place to eat and spontaneously came to sushi samba. we weren't too hungry so didn't get a full dinner. i ordered the pork gyozas (and the kabocha pumpkin pure\\u00e9 underneath was a really nice touch). the gyozas were realllly really good, i still think about them. i also ordered the green envy rolls (tuna, salmon, asparagus, wasabi pea crust with a lime mayo) and although it was good, it wasn't as outstanding as the gyozas. unfor<mark>Tuna</mark> i did not yelp before going, so did not get to try out the fruity drinks that everybody's raving about (sad face). i did share the chocolate fondue with a friend, and it came with the chocolate already melted with no heat element under it, so we took it as a sign that we had to eat it quickly. the dipping mediums were: coconut marshmallows, <mark>Steamed Japanese Rice</mark> crispies, passion fruit cake, chocolate brownie, fruits, and green tea ice cream. overall, i really liked the surroundings, i did feel like it matched up to the vegas environment. it was definitely a fun place for dinner before a night out!",

            "had reservations and arrived at scheduled time. was immediately taken to our table. food was fantastic and the presentation of each dish was lovely. the ladies next to us kept asking what we ordered so that they could order too. we started with the tuna ceviche- fantastic! i had the beef tenderloin and aji panca anticuchos (two skewers served with <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark>), <mark>Roasted Seasonal Vegetables</mark>, <mark>Samba Strip</mark> roll <mark>Half Maine Lobster</mark>. my friend had several sushi rolls-  everything was great! we finished with rosca homemade doughnuts with hazelnut chocolate dipping sauce and a warm chocolate banana cake maple butter, banana chip, vanilla rum ice cream. devine!!!!!!!!!! i had 2 beers and my friend had sake- dinner for 2 was a bit pricey (thus the 4 stars) but service was very good.the place is very loud, music pulsates the whole time and the video loop playing on the walls is a bit odd- it's hard to have a conversation. i want to go again and try some more dishes!", 
            "on the saturday of my bachelorette party, my girlfriends treated me to dinner at sushi samba.  it was a fabulous, memorable meal, where we ate well and celebrated in style.\n\nwe were staying at the palazzo, and sushi samba was the perfect venue for the occasion.  it was convenient to get to in heels, and the atmosphere was festive, edging on clubby without being obnoxious.  we had a big comfortable table, and service was excellent.  i wish we'd gotten the name of our waiter - he did a great job attending to our every need, and he guided us through the whole dining experience with expertise.  (for management - he was a tall guy who served a party of nine on 6/29.  you know, your only bachelorette party of the month?)\n\nwe ordered cocktails, which were pretty good.  i had a blame it on rio, a caipirinha variation with cacha\\u00e7a, agave syrup, fresh lime juice, cucumber, and jalape\\u00f1o.  it was both cool and spicy, and it went down really easy.  the classic caipirinha was also great, with just the cacha\\u00e7a, lime, and sugar.  i also tried some of the chu-cumber, a shochu drink with hendricks gin, elderflower liqueur, and muddled cucumber - very refreshing.  at some point, we got a complimentary cocktail tree, a beautiful iron tree bearing shot-sized wine glasses on every branch.  they held some frothy, sweet version of a screwdriver that was great for the occasion.\n\ndinner was delicious.  we had the option of ordering a la carte or omakase, and we decided to keep things simple.  we specified a price point and listed dietary restrictions, and the food just started coming.  it was all served family style, and everything was well portioned for our big group.  we left full but not overstuffed - a plus, since it had taken a team to stuff me into my white dress for the night.  the cuisine was fun, a creative, unforced fusion of japanese and peruvian styles.\n\nfirst, we had a trio of vegetable otsumami, all served together in a lovely green array.  there was the staple edamame with sea salt and lime, and <mark>Green Bean Tempura</mark> served with a rich black truffle aioli.  my favorite of the three, though, was the handful of shishito peppers.  these were grilled blistering black, polished with sea salt and lemon.  they were pretty irresistible.  next we got a tray of japanese a5 <mark>Seared W<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> Beef</mark> gyoza.  these were great, thin-skinned and stuffed with luscious hunks of beef rather than the usual mince.  they came with kabocha pumpkin pur\\u00e9e, a sweet soy drizzle, and a su-shoyu dipping sauce.  the best thing i ate all night, though, was a crispy taquito overflowing with yelllowtail, avocado, and roasted corn miso.  the shell was thin and crunchy, and the fresh, tender fish was just right with that avocado, miso, and some thinly sliced vegetables.  the taquitos were served with spicy aji panca sauce and fresh lime - that piquant, frothy sauce was just the icing on a beautiful fusion taco cake.\n\nafter the smaller plates were done, we moved on to big platters of sushi and sashimi.  i do not remember everything we got, as there were at least six or seven rolls and even more kinds of sashimi.  the rolls were great, a nice mix of california standards - you know, the mix and match of eel, yellowtail, tuna, etc. with avocado, cucumber, and dots of mayo - and more samba-specific stuff, with the stray <mark><mark>Alaskan King Crab</mark> Leg</mark> and lobster claw.  i particularly liked the <mark>Samba Strip</mark>, with <mark>Half Maine Lobster</mark> tempura, mango, tomato, chive, soy paper, and a coating of crispy rice.  it was unusual and flavorful, served with a peanut curry.  the rest of the platter came with a sweet thick soy sauce and a bit of mayo.  the sashimi was more traditional, served on a bed of ice.  it was hard to share, as there was only one of each kind, but the slivers i had were great.\n\nthe most filling part of the meal was the churrasco course.  we got two hefty platters of the <mark>Rio Grande</mark> with three meats, grilled hanger steak, ribeye, and chorizo.  these were great, juicy and tender and full of that hearty grilled meat flavor.  they came with a trio of dipping sauces - malagueta pepper oil, chimichurri, and a third that is infuriatingly absent from the menu.  we also had some sides of rice, beans, collard greens, and a medley of <mark>Roasted Seasonal Vegetables</mark> - giant corn kernels, toothsome brussels sprouts, carrots, celery, pearl onions, and more.  we also got miso-marinated chilean <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> a la carte, with roasted organic vegetables and oshinko.  this was a winner - the fish was moist, flakey, and shot through with miso flavor.\n\nwe were full by dessert, but loved the complimentary chocolate mousse, served with a sparkler and a congratulatory message.  the lush mousse came topped with crunchy chocolate pearls, whipped cream, and a little bit of candle-stuck banana.  we each got a sweet bite to end our wonderful dinner.\n\nin conclusion, my friends are the best - thank you girls for this weekend, and for this fun, delicious meal.  sushi samba was an a+ choice, worthy of a night i won't soon forget.", 
            "\"professor in the mist\"\n\npretty brown legs moved her quickly about the room, her tight black skirt barely hiding what lay beneath. eyewear gave her a professorial look, high heels a come hither look. yet it was the direct and patient manner in which she explained the menu items to my father that sealed her as the total package for me. i wish i remembered this fine creature's name but, alas, i was much too smitten to remember such a detail.\n\ndad ordered his usual scotch and mom and i opted for plain water. as we looked over the fare--a japanese/south american type blend--i kept stealing looks at the professor. she caught me a few times but neither of us cared. both of us smiled, in fact. it was an old game played by many throughout time, usually with far more success than ever attained by yours truly. that aside, the dining room was darkly lit, with a sushi bar in back and bar in front. a raucous group of tuxedo wearing party boys were slamming shots on the stools but eventually simmered down. perhaps one of the uber hawt barmaids had mentioned their over exuberance and they'd relented.\n\nanyway, after smooth as silk tutoring from the professor my dad finally settled on <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>(miso) and <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark> with a side of <mark>Roasted Seasonal Vegetables</mark>. mom went with a single samba roll which contained <mark>Half Maine Lobster</mark>, mango, tomato, chive, crispy rice, soy paper and peanut curry. and as for me, i wasn't in the mood for seafood so i asked for chicken teriyaki(samba style) with <mark>Purple Potato Mash</mark> potatoes. \n\nthe verdict?\n\nperhaps everything was fine. i never really know when with my parents. their company is somewhat like being immersed in fine mist after a few drinks. you can sort of see and understand what's going on, but not very clearly, which means you occasionally misread what's actually occurring. to wit: dad liked his fish(but he picked the restaurant so he would have liked whatever slop they put in front of him). mom said her lobster roll was good(but she never says negative things until years after the fact. kind of like her own statute of limitations if you will). and me? i always kind of defer to their mindset when in their company so i think my chicken and potatoes were good, although for something touted on the menu as a large plate i wish there had been more bird and buds.\n\neventually the professor laid our check on the table, and dad swiped it up before i could, although i must confess it was a lame and slow attempt on the part of my right hand. he gave his usual 15% tip and we departed sushisamba--which by the way is located off the shopping section of the palazzo hotel/casino. \n\ni guess we might have had a nice time there(i can't really be sure) but this much i do know: mist or no mist, the professor in high heels forever has my heart in her grasp...."

            "sushi samba was the perfect spot to fill up on tasty food after a quick shopping spree at the shoppes at the palazzo with my fashionista girlfriend. we went straight for the $16 chilean <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> bento box, which was the best deal on the lunch menu. it came with <mark>Miso Soup</mark>, <mark>Field Green Salad</mark>, tuna roll and oshinko pickles. \n\nthe three skewers of miso glazed <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>, along with all the sides, was a nice amount of food (though could've been a little small for a big appetite), but i seriously could have eaten three more skewers. the <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> was amazing! that miso marinade was to die for. i suppose i could've gotten the entree portion, but for lunch, it was perfect. plus, $29 is a bit much to spend on a lunch entree. there were six tuna rolls, so that also made the bento filling.\n\nthe funky decor was really cool, and reminded me a little of blowfish in the bay area -- but much bigger and with latin influences intertwined. the staff was awesome, and the food came out quick. we were in and out in a flash, and back to the pool before our guys even missed us."

            "i had an amazing experience at sushi samba last night.  fair enough, it wasn't packed so i'm sure it was easier to pay attention to us, but still.  it's not too often that you get brazilian/peruvian/japanese food on one menu.  our server javier was fantastic - attentive, helpful, knowledgeable, fun, but not the least bit overbearing.  the manager hayes was the same.  we felt like we were constantly checked on and attended to - quite luxurious.\nthey helped us pick some amazing items off of the giant menu, and we were thrilled with all of the items we had.\ntempura green beans, yellowtail tiradito, the <mark>Samba Strip</mark> roll (possibly our favorite), and the churrasco (we got hanger steak, pork tenderloin and linguisa).\nthe cocktails.  \noh.\nmy.\ngod.\nthe cocktails.  \namazing, fresh, delicious. . . . i had the monthly special (a strawberry mojito), and a lemon samurai which was seriously the most amazing drink i've ever had.\nmy only gripe with things that are flown in fresh from all around the world - impressive yes, but the environment scowls in your general direction sushi samba.  situated in the largest leed certified building in the world (http://www.commercialpropertynews.com/cpn/content_display/regions/southwest/e3i76b446d81cf85aa4fc437cba15737e76), you'd think this would be a faux pas.  \ntake advantage of it if your conscience allows - you won't be sorry.  the two of us got out after two cocktails each and the shared food mentioned for under $150.  not bad for an upscale vegas restaurant.", 
            "i went here with a bachelorette party of about 7 of us.  none of us had been here before and didn't know what to expect.  we made dinner reservations, but still had to wait a bit to get our table.  once we got in... the server was definitely hospitable, gracious, and informative - i only wished i remembered his name to give a shout out. he informed us of the type of restaurant sushi samba was, which is a fusion of japanese, brazilian and peruvian.  we all weren't sure of what to get so he suggested we do a \"tasty menu\" which i think was the omakase (on the website menu).  this allowed us to try the different types of food the menu had to offer.  we let him know what we liked and what we didn't like and he informed the chefs and they brought out a plethora of tasty treats that was enough for 7 of us.  it started off with some appetizers, such as the otsumani ( an assortment of edamame, tempura green beans and shishito  - spicy peppers.... absolutely delicious!) and an assortment of other appetizers that i can't remember.  we then had a n array of seviche.  after that we had different types of meats on skewers and then topped off the evening with sashimi and sushi rolls.  one thing, we were all in awe of the food , we could hardly remember what everything was.  a huge highlight of the dinner was the yellowtail seviche! an absolute delicious delight.  another overwhelming mouth watering treat was the chilean <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> on skewers with <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark>.  i believe we also had the <mark>Samba Strip</mark> roll at the end of the meal which was thoroughly mouth quenching!  we all sat back after the meal and were all very happy and pleased with this establishment and all said how we were going to have to come back there every vegas excursion we go on.  it is a bit pricey.. but i think the food is worth the $$$$.  on top of all that, the atmosphere was definitely pleasing as well as the music which kept me moving in my seat all night.  this place is well worth the 5 star rating and worth the $$$$!",

            "chilean <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> skewers with miso - absolutely delicious!  the <mark><mark>Jumbo Shrimp</mark></mark> with passionfruit ceviche -- original and delightful.  my husband's favorite dish was the <mark>Tuna Tataki</mark> .  we came here because i had a taste for sushi and it was the highest ranked by yelpers.  when we arrived, the bar atmosphere caused us to question the yelp reviews but after eating we agree.  the sushi rolls aren't that great (we tried the <mark>Samba Strip</mark> and <mark>El Topo</mark>) but they weren't horrible.  the servers are familiar with the entire menu so if you don't have a specific taste for something, feel free to ask them for their suggestion. they'll have a ton.  also, their drinks are good but lean away from being sweet.  i had to have them muddle more sugar and mint to flavor up my drink a little more because it just tasted like rum with a little mint when they first brought it out.  this is a tapas place so you can easily order 4 plates per person which can get pricey.  but highly recommend for their chilean <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> skewers.  i haven't had <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> this good since g. garvin's restaurant in west los angeles closed a few years ago.  outstanding.", 
            "4 stars for the dessert and tempura green beans.\n\neverything else was meh.\n\nordered the <mark>Samba Strip</mark> roll which came with a little lobster tail and had mango in it.  it was average.  the peanut curry sauce i wasn't a fan of as it tasted like ginger and i was not feelin it.\n\nbut the star was the dessert...banana honey crispy taquitos.  they have a caramel sauce on top and chocolate on the bottom. amazing\n\nand the <mark>Green Bean Tempura</mark> is served with black truffle aoili.  i yelled so loud the table next to me ordered it.  it was a very \"when harry met sally\" moment \"i'll have what she's having\"",

            "wow! this was definitely the highlight of our trip!  the atmosphere is amazing, very cool and hip.  our waitress was probably the best we've ever had; she was friendly, fast, and so helpful with recommending items from the menu.  \n\nwe had the edamame to start, and they were perfectly done with a delicious sprinkle of sea salt & lime. <mark>Miso Soup</mark> was yummy.   we then tried the beef tenderloin and aji panca, and the <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark> was scrumptious!  we had a <mark>Samba Strip</mark> roll & a green envy roll... omg, so good!  \n\nfor dessert we had the chocolate fondue.  such a cute presentation, and simply a delicious finish to our meal.\n\nwhen we got our bill, we were surprised at how much we had spent, but we both agreed it was completely worth every penny! best meal we've had in vegas, by far!",

            "i celebrated my birthday here and was looking forward to trying the wonderful looking food i've seen posted. i even picked out the most popular items (of course, according to yelp) and took my server's recommendations. however, i expected my taste buds to have a party that night, and it fell a little short.\n\noverall, it was a good dinner. service was impeccable. from beginning to end, their staff worked perfectly together to make sure we enjoyed our experience. water were always refilled, our emptied plates were cleared immediately, yet they didn't hover or rush us. very friendly. we really couldn't have asked for a better wait staff to serve us.\n\nwhat did we order?\n\ncrispy taquitos - yellowtail & lobster\nrib-eye robata skewers\nmiso marinated chilean <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> w/ purple sweet mashed potatoes\n<mark>Peruvian Corn</mark>\n<mark>Samba Strip</mark> roll\nbobo brazil roll\nrosca - donuts\n\nthe best tasting dishes for us was of course the chilean <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>. it was good enough that we were a bit disappointed that it was such a small serving size. two small skewers. <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark> was also a hit. however, the sushi rolls were well presented, but lacked much in flavor. the rib-eye and taquitos were decent, but as i reiterate, all pretty to look at, yet nothing came close to being a wow.\n\nsetting is very nice, the restaurant is nice set up to accommodate large parties as well as couples. bar serves food and offer happy hour drinks till 7pm on weekdays. \n\ni definitely appreciated the complimentary birthday dessert, the coco duo, which was sweet and yummy. photos are available of all items i listed here. \n\n3 stars for now, however i'd definitely give sushi samba another try. maybe the wow will come later...", 
            "i ate at this location recently and the one in chicago (in 2011)...i must say the chicago location was much better. our group was craving sushi so we stick to ordering mostly japanese food instead of the brazilian or peruvian dishes.\n\nsome of the dishes i remembered ordering were <mark>Samba Strip</mark> (terrible!!!), yamato, bobo brazil, extra crunchy salmon skin hand roll, <mark><mark>Samba Sushi & Sashimi</mark></mark>, uni, yellowtail ceviche tacos and some other stuff. the two best dishes were the yamato roll with <mark>Foie Gras</mark> and the uni (very fresh). everything else was so-so with the biggest disappointment was the <mark>Samba Strip</mark> roll. \n\noverall nothing was memorable. i was quite disappointed given my last experience in chicago was so mouthwatering i've been waiting to go to vegas to try again.", 
            "this was my second time here and after going to the chicago location, chicago rules all the way. the worst roll ever was the <mark>Samba Strip</mark> w/lobster, it looked like an amateur put it together. there was no flavor and for the price of $19, umm not! the only roll that was good was the yamato (<mark>Foie Gras</mark>) and bobo brazil (<mark>Seared W<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> Beef</mark>). \n\nhowever, you must order the coco duo, it was the bomb!!!", 
            "we arrived at the restaurant at about 12:40 on a saturday night. the hours stated that they close at 2am however you would think it was 1 because we were rushed. the waiter was kind enough but he told us that the kitchen was closing and from that point he spewed suggestions out faster than we could look at the descriptions of them on the menu and it seemed as if they were just trying to feed us and get us out. the ambiance and seating were pleasant. we started with the <mark>Samba Strip</mark> and the green envy rolls. they were just ok. i have paid $15-20 for sushi rolls before and was less than impressed with the taste of these selections which tasted like run of the mill, $5 rolls. however, we ordered the raved about <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> skewers that were recommended here on yelp and wow were we blown away. succulent, juicy and jam packed with flavor. the waiter even gave us an extra one, perhaps because of the rush. if we weren't full from the rolls and didn't observe our server motion to the kitchen that they were done several minutes before we received the skewers, then we would have asked for another order... maybe two lol.  we give 3 stars because of the overpriced sushi rolls and the feeling of being hurried but if you get a chance, try the <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> skewers and maybe some of the other dishes... i'll definitely give them a second chance...perhaps a little earlier in the day next time.", 
            "we enjoyed sushisamba twice while staying at the palazzo. the first time, we had lunch and the second time, we met a group for drinks after dinner. \n\nlunch\n\nthe whole japanese/brazilian/peruvian fusion idea had me curious. that, and if i am honest with myself, i was craving sushi because it's been awhile. enter sushisamba for lunch. we were seated promptly at a booth and perused the menu. after some deliberation, i decided on the <mark>Samba Strip</mark> roll (<mark>Half Maine Lobster</mark> tempura, mango, tomato, chive, crispy rice, soy paper, peanut curry) and a side of <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark>. the presentation of the <mark>Samba Strip</mark> roll was lovely, and the lobster claw was filled with succulent meat - as it turns out, chopsticks are the perfect implement for digging out every single morsel of claw meat. the peanut sauce was delicious with a tang at the end that had me coming back for more. and interestingly enough, the <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark>, when dipped in the peanut sauce, was quite delicious. the <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark> itself was wonderful - it has a slightly sweet, tangy sauce on it which complemented the roasted goodness of the corn very well. about the size and similar to hominy, it had a memorable (in a good way) stick-to-your-teeth texture.\n\ndrinks\n\nthe atmosphere becomes more clubbish in the evening and the music gets turned up a notch. we gathered at the front in the waiting/bar area and pretty much took over the couch and chairs there. our server was great about allowing us to hang out there for an hour or so over drinks. speaking of drinks, i had an amazing concoction called the nashi martini (grey goose la poire, shochu, st. germain elderflower liquor, fresh lychee, passion fruit ). i could have bathed in it, given the chance.",

            "on the saturday of my bachelorette party, my girlfriends treated me to dinner at sushi samba.  it was a fabulous, memorable meal, where we ate well and celebrated in style.\n\nwe were staying at the palazzo, and sushi samba was the perfect venue for the occasion.  it was convenient to get to in heels, and the atmosphere was festive, edging on clubby without being obnoxious.  we had a big comfortable table, and service was excellent.  i wish we'd gotten the name of our waiter - he did a great job attending to our every need, and he guided us through the whole dining experience with expertise.  (for management - he was a tall guy who served a party of nine on 6/29.  you know, your only bachelorette party of the month?)\n\nwe ordered cocktails, which were pretty good.  i had a blame it on rio, a caipirinha variation with cacha\\u00e7a, agave syrup, fresh lime juice, cucumber, and jalape\\u00f1o.  it was both cool and spicy, and it went down really easy.  the classic caipirinha was also great, with just the cacha\\u00e7a, lime, and sugar.  i also tried some of the chu-cumber, a shochu drink with hendricks gin, elderflower liqueur, and muddled cucumber - very refreshing.  at some point, we got a complimentary cocktail tree, a beautiful iron tree bearing shot-sized wine glasses on every branch.  they held some frothy, sweet version of a screwdriver that was great for the occasion.\n\ndinner was delicious.  we had the option of ordering a la carte or omakase, and we decided to keep things simple.  we specified a price point and listed dietary restrictions, and the food just started coming.  it was all served family style, and everything was well portioned for our big group.  we left full but not overstuffed - a plus, since it had taken a team to stuff me into my white dress for the night.  the cuisine was fun, a creative, unforced fusion of japanese and peruvian styles.\n\nfirst, we had a trio of vegetable otsumami, all served together in a lovely green array.  there was the staple edamame with sea salt and lime, and <mark>Green Bean Tempura</mark> served with a rich black truffle aioli.  my favorite of the three, though, was the handful of shishito peppers.  these were grilled blistering black, polished with sea salt and lemon.  they were pretty irresistible.  next we got a tray of japanese a5 <mark>Seared W<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> Beef</mark> gyoza.  these were great, thin-skinned and stuffed with luscious hunks of beef rather than the usual mince.  they came with kabocha pumpkin pur\\u00e9e, a sweet soy drizzle, and a su-shoyu dipping sauce.  the best thing i ate all night, though, was a crispy taquito overflowing with yelllowtail, avocado, and roasted corn miso.  the shell was thin and crunchy, and the fresh, tender fish was just right with that avocado, miso, and some thinly sliced vegetables.  the taquitos were served with spicy aji panca sauce and fresh lime - that piquant, frothy sauce was just the icing on a beautiful fusion taco cake.\n\nafter the smaller plates were done, we moved on to big platters of sushi and sashimi.  i do not remember everything we got, as there were at least six or seven rolls and even more kinds of sashimi.  the rolls were great, a nice mix of california standards - you know, the mix and match of eel, yellowtail, tuna, etc. with avocado, cucumber, and dots of mayo - and more samba-specific stuff, with the stray <mark><mark>Alaskan King Crab</mark> Leg</mark> and lobster claw.  i particularly liked the <mark>Samba Strip</mark>, with <mark>Half Maine Lobster</mark> tempura, mango, tomato, chive, soy paper, and a coating of crispy rice.  it was unusual and flavorful, served with a peanut curry.  the rest of the platter came with a sweet thick soy sauce and a bit of mayo.  the sashimi was more traditional, served on a bed of ice.  it was hard to share, as there was only one of each kind, but the slivers i had were great.\n\nthe most filling part of the meal was the churrasco course.  we got two hefty platters of the <mark>Rio Grande</mark> with three meats, grilled hanger steak, ribeye, and chorizo.  these were great, juicy and tender and full of that hearty grilled meat flavor.  they came with a trio of dipping sauces - malagueta pepper oil, chimichurri, and a third that is infuriatingly absent from the menu.  we also had some sides of rice, beans, collard greens, and a medley of <mark>Roasted Seasonal Vegetables</mark> - giant corn kernels, toothsome brussels sprouts, carrots, celery, pearl onions, and more.  we also got miso-marinated chilean <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> a la carte, with roasted organic vegetables and oshinko.  this was a winner - the fish was moist, flakey, and shot through with miso flavor.\n\nwe were full by dessert, but loved the complimentary chocolate mousse, served with a sparkler and a congratulatory message.  the lush mousse came topped with crunchy chocolate pearls, whipped cream, and a little bit of candle-stuck banana.  we each got a sweet bite to end our wonderful dinner.\n\nin conclusion, my friends are the best - thank you girls for this weekend, and for this fun, delicious meal.  sushi samba was an a+ choice, worthy of a night i won't soon forget.", 
            "very fresh, very good, but very fast. we sat at the sushi bar expecting to be able to see the chefs make the sushi, but the glass wasn't see though. i had the <mark>Samba Strip</mark> roll which was excellent and my mom had the california roll which she said was average. we also had the gyoza as an appetizer but it came out after our rolls so it wasn't a true appetizer i suppose. great variety of food offered both sushi, brazilian, and less adventurous dishes. the only complaint is how i felt hurried along to finish my meal everything was so fast.", 
            "had the <mark>Samba Strip</mark> roll with <mark>Half Maine Lobster</mark>, mango, crispy rice and peanut curry.  awesome!!  had the yamato roll with caviar, <mark>Foie Gras</mark>, and gold leaf.  awesome!!  also has the edamame with chili lime sauce.  awesome!!", 
            "my experience at sushisamba was amazing. lively atmosphere and great vibe. the service was impeccable; very attentive. some of our dishes took a little longer than usual (it was a saturday night) but they let us know right away and we didn't mind. the <mark>Tuna Tataki</mark> was very fresh and the <mark>Samba Strip</mark> and green envy rolls were delicious. they even brought out a birthday dessert for me which was thoughtful. definitely would recommend this restaurant for dinner.", 
            "since we were staying in the palazzo, i figured it would be easiest to dine in the hotel our first night in vegas. sushisamba sounded like a really interesting fusion of brazilian, peruvian, and japanese cuisine.\n\ninside i found a very lively, posh atmosphere. there was great music playing, giving it more of a club ambiance than that of a restaurant. i also liked the graffiti paint job on the walls. our waitress was tremendous, and the manager came to check on us periodically too. they definitely aren't lacking in the service department. all in all, this was a really enjoyable place to eat dinner.\n\nwe decided to go tapas style and order a bunch of different things to try. my dinner companion didn't have any preferences, so i ordered two small plates (<mark>Seared W<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> Beef</mark> <mark>Salt and Pepper Squid</mark>), two kinds of sashimi tiradito (kanpachi and tuna), and two samba rolls (<mark>Samba Strip</mark> roll and <mark>Sasa Handroll</mark>).\n\nour small plates came out first. i was excited to try the <mark>Seared W<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> Beef</mark>, which comes with a ponzu gelee, honshimeji mushrooms, and a truffled tofu crema. the meat was amazingly tender, and i liked the acidity of it all. even the mushrooms were very flavorful. the <mark>Salt and Pepper Squid</mark> was also very good. it comes with dry miso, shichimi, sea salt, crispy garlic, and smoked soy. this dish was definitely spicy. it was like calamari, but way better.\n\nnext up was the sashimi tiradito. the kanpachi (amberjack) comes with yuzu, sea salt, and black truffle oil. it was absolutely packed with flavor, and i enjoyed the saltiness of it. the tuna is served in a ceviche-style bath of granny smith apple, serrano peppers, and lime. it was beautifully sweet and spicy at the same time.\n\nwe were getting a little full, but we still had two samba rolls to go. the <mark>Samba Strip</mark> roll is a combination of <mark>Half Maine Lobster</mark>, mango, tomato, crispy rice, soy paper, and peanut curry. i absolutely loved the mango in there, which paired nicely with the peanut. the <mark>Sasa Handroll</mark> was very different from what you might expect sushi to be. it comes with <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark>, quinoa, shishito, cilantro, spicy mayonnaise, and red onion wrapped in some sort of cone. our waitress suggested we get two, since it's not very conducive to sharing. i agree. the sasa roll was a little difficult to eat, but well worth the effort. \n\ni didn't think we had waited very long for our dinner at all, but nonetheless the manager thought so, and to make up for it she brought over complimentary green tea sorbet pops for dessert. to put it mildly, they were amazing!\n\nsushisamba was absolutely top notch all the way around.", 
            "one of the many reasons i love the palazzo is the creepy-when-you-think-about-it facts that you can have a week long vacay and never really go outside. one of the other reasons i like the joint is... sushisamba. \n\nall fusion isn't created equal and most of what's deemed fusion in the multi-billion dollar tourist traps still doesn't cut it as top notch cuisine... but in three rotations over the years, the one thing i can say is that they've consistently delivered a good experience.  and that's more than i can say for a few others that are no longer at the palazzo.   it's also consistently noisy... do with that what you will. \n\nfavorites from the menu... <mark>Moqueca Mista</mark> (kinda hard to mess up fish stew with good ingredients ) and the <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> are my favorites of the full entries, which i wouldn't recommend on a first visit.  save big plates for your second or third go round.  almost anything with the w<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> is a hit; i think sushisamba drives the south american flavors home using fine japanese beef.  but if it works... \n\nthe yamato roll... epic as it is... to me, is **almost** overkill.  super indulgent <mark>Foie Gras</mark> and w<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> are almost a taste bud assault.   but at the same time, you have to try it-share it. the sa\\u00f5 paulo and the <mark>Neo Tokyo</mark> are my favorites here.   the <mark>Samba Strip</mark> is also pretty awesome.  again, pile enough good things together and see what happens. \n\nthe so so and not so on the menu... if anything ... rock shrimp (discontinued) and tiger <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark>.   mojitos are so so...( to me) as well.   the robata squid was literally hit and miss; had it once and it was great... and the next time... just rubber. \n\nall in all, come here with good company, a serious appetite and charge it to the room...i prefer early lunch or just after midnight.", 
            "jason, you are the man! thank you for making both this time and last time an incredible experience.\n\nreturned a month or so later, eager to try it out again next time i came back to vegas.\n\ni think this round somehow exceeding my experience last time. i got a lot of the same dishes, as well as tried out a few new ones and i was not dissapointed.\n\nour waitress was incredible and service was quick and enjoyable...even the parties next to us had a great time and sparked great conversation. the ambiance is hip and sexy while still being inviting and enjoyable.\n\nin addition to last time, we got the chuchumber cocktail which wasn't too sweet but amazingly refreshing. we also got the phyllo-wrapped scallop which at first i assumed would take away from the taste of the scallop but instead the combination of textures was just awesome. \n\nwe wanted to try one of the peruvian ceviches, so we went with the ginger/soy yellowfin one, which was pretty tasty but not quite up on the same level when it comes to crazy flavor profiles. \n\nthe other new dish we got was the <mark>Samba Strip</mark> roll. as somewhat of a sushi afficianado, i was excited to try it but not expecting a whole lot. crazy enough the lobster and mango combination with the peanut curry sauce was really crazy good. the roll also was made with some crispy rice and served with a meaty lobster claw so it was a solid choice. \n\nthe <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>, sashimi, and little kobe taquitos were just as good as i remembered them and was not let down.\n\nthank you to everyone at sushi samba for making it such a great second experience. i've already sent a number of friends over and i will definitely continue recommending more your way.", 
            "lunch at sushisamba is the best!  we were promptly seated at a round table with a good view of the whole restaurant.  the restaurant energy is vibrant, full of energy and colorful.  we ordered 2 orders of the 3 kinds of seaweed 'cos we love seaweed!  i love the crunchy pink seaweed, the light green is the common one and the black seaweed was a little coarser.  all were good!  the <mark>Salt and Pepper Squid</mark> arrived - succulent and tender.   next came the <mark>Huancaina Fries</mark> - peru potatoes with queso fresco - delicious!  oh yes!  our favorites were up next:  <mark>Hamachi Kama</mark> - yellowtail fish collar - 2 beautiful pieces charred with a squeeze of key lime and a side of su shohyu sauce - fresh and so tasty!  each one got one <mark>Hamachi Kama</mark> - and that's a lot of fish!  \n\nsuddenly there was break and no food arrived.  we were wondering what happened... then appeared the manager with 2 plates - one dish of <mark>Broiled Peruvian Bay Scallop</mark> (there were 4 in total)  with on one dish and the other a taco with waygu beef for my mum 'cos she's lactose-intolerant.  i was wondering why the waiter had asked us if we had any seashell allergies or any allergies at about 1/3 of the way into our lunch.  now, i know why!!  :o).  the manager explained that he wanted to give us these free appetizers 'cos we were repeat customers!  how generous!  \n\nwe also ordered 2 more rolls - <mark>Samba Strip</mark> - <mark>Half Maine Lobster</mark> - need i say more!  and the lima roll - shrimp and crab.  yummy rolls and the best i've ever had!! \n\nservice was fantastic and we will come back again!", 
            "my wallet was crying and i left hungry.. \nkeep in my this place should be dined at only for the experience and not to get full!\n\nfood: \n1. seaweed appetizer: \nto my surprise when this appetizer was delivered to our table there were three different types. i still think that green jelly looking one taste the best. \n\n2. <mark>Huancaina Fries</mark>: \nthis side dish was super tasty. the fries were actually baby potatoes dressed with a cream sauce and cheese. it was mmm mmm good!.\n\n3. <mark>Samba Strip</mark> roll: \nmy friends and i initially chose this roll because we saw that there was lobster in it. with the roll also came a curry dipping sauce. personally, i liked the roll by itself because the curry  sauce tasted kind of tart/ sour. \n\n4. <mark>Rainbow Dragon</mark> roll: \nthe usual dragon roll, nothing special.\n\n5. carnaval: \nthis was my favorite of all the rolls. the contents of the rolls included: shrimp, avocado, yellowtail. a simple but tasty roll overall. \n\nservice: \nthe waiter came by pretty frequently to refill our waters and ask if we needed anything. \n\nfinal verdict: \nthe fish/ lobster was extremely fresh, but i don't know if i can get over the $$$ prices. definitely a great las vegas dining experience though.", 
            "so we just finished a late night meal here. i consider me and my fianc\\u00e9 to be sushi connoisseurs. we found it to be just 'meh. but than again, we have been blown away at other restaurants and after all this is a chain....\n\nanyway, we got here after 11pm and were seated. we specifically came here for the happy hour but were told after being seated, happy hour menu is at the bar only. you mean the 15 seat bar? we don't drink so i declined. not to forget, it's no where stated on the menu... our mediocre late night snack came to $70....\n\nshould stuck to my rule of only dining where the locals go. \n\n<mark>Salt and Pepper Squid</mark>- good. not overly fried. lime was nice touch.\n\n<mark>Samba Strip</mark>, <mark>Salmon Avocado</mark> and <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark>... nothing fancy and have had way better.", 
            "i have eaten here a lot for dinner throughout the years. we were in search of a great lunch. we found it here at sushisamba. we had the perfect lunch to get us through a busy day in vegas. we had the seared w<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> small plate (always my favorite-i always order this), <mark>Coconut Rice</mark>, the <mark>Samba Strip</mark> roll and the yuzu tart cheesecake. everything was delicious and had great presentation. i loved that is was not loud and overcrowded at lunch. we had just the perfect lunch. the specialty drinks are a must. i can't remember the names, but one that had japanese whiskey in it with pineapple was absolutely delicious. i highly recommend it. the general manager, jeremy made our lunch extra special with a tasting of a new dish of cooked <mark>Scallop</mark> with a pesto sauce that was dynamite and the miso marinated <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> dish. everything was amazing and not heavy. the <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> to our surprise was our favorite dish, but there wasn't anything we tried that wasn't delicious. it was so moist and had so much flavor. i love this menu because it is diverse and there is something for everyone's specific taste buds and you can easily share if you'd like. my husband really enjoyed the experience here. thank you to jeremy for a great experience along with the wonderful wait staff. if you want a meal that is diverse in flavor and presentation and will leave you full, but not heavy and uncomfortable-this is the perfect place. you get the full package here with great service and delicious food. well worth it."

            "modern chic fusion restaurant in the new palazzo hotel, featuring brazilian and japanese food. the interior much reminded me of social house in treasure island, dark and swanky. the small plates are meant for sharing, but the tab adds up quick. the server proclaimed their sake menu as the largest in the country, but unfor<mark>Tuna</mark> we didn't get to try any.\n\nwe had the <mark><mark>Assortment of Four</mark></mark> sashimi which were nice and fresh with delicate flavors. my favorite was the tuna with granny smith apple, serrano, and lime.\n\nthe <mark>Hamachi Kama</mark> (yellowtail cheek) was as good as i've had, but missing the grated daikon that it <mark><mark>Osetra Caviar Imperial 20g</mark> 20g</mark> comes with.\n\nchicken liver anticuchos (two skewers served over <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark>) were very livery. i expected them to be only lightly livery, like my favorite pho ga place serves up, not sure if it's due to the prep or the <mark>Grade A5</mark> liver or what.\n\nwe also tried a couple rolls, the <mark>Neo Tokyo</mark> with yellowfin tuna, tempura flake, aji panca. i liked this one more than the bobo brazil with seared kobe beef, avocado, kaiware, shiso, red onion, chimichurri. the kobe beef looked raw rather than seared, maybe seared would have brought out the flavors a bit. both rolls were pretty good though.\n\nthe standout of the meal was the <mark>Berkshire Pork Belly</mark> butterscotch miso, which was meltingly tender, with a subtle sweetness contrasting the richness of the luscious pork.\n\nwe also tried the little tiny crabs we saw in an ad, sawagani, which are flash fried japanese river crabs. these were literally tiny, and the small bite had a texture like an egg shell, with a flavor best described as a subtle fish sauce.\n\ncome here if you have an appetite for a variety of small bites with delicate but well thought out flavors.",

            "i think the reason why i put off this review for 2 months is that i've been afraid of not praising this place enough with what i'm about to say in a couple of lines. first of all, thanks to my procrastination, i've forgotten the incredibly friendly manager's name who treated us newly legals to 3 chu-cumber shots, which, btw, go down ridiculously well. (maybe his name was anthony...?) anyway, he also hooked us up with a bouncer at tryst and we got in without having to wait! so the staff and their service is really really amazing. i'm pretty positive if you go there (soon), there will still be this omg-drool-with-my-eyes-like-it's-possible waiter there ready and waiting to fill up your glass of water... or take your order... or ravage - no, that's it. \n\nenough about the awesome service, the food was also really really amazing. it's a brazilian/japanese fusion type restaurant, but i'm not really big on brazilian unless it's like a churascaria, so we went with mainly japanese type dishes.

            "i love sushi samba! the rolls are amazing...this time i tried the <mark>Neo Tokyo</mark> roll and the <mark>El Topo</mark> roll. i also finally got to try the crispy yellowtail taquitos. like i said before it's a bit pricy, but worth it. however i would say a 3.5 star rating this time because our service wasn't as great as the past few times i've been here. he forgot our appetizer, the rolls took forever, and he forgot to refill our drinks. the worst part about it we went when it wasn't busy at all...maybe it was the fact that there was a table next to us spending a lot of $$$$ because he was going to their table non-stop and their food came out faster than ours...even though we ordered 10 mins before they did :[",

(feel free to skip the kobe on a platter of mushrooms as it was on okay and not really worth the money as the kobe was a lot more well done). moreover the sashimi kobe was a little to this for my tastes and not as lean as i would have liked. as for the fish you can't go wrong with the otoro or yellowtail. as for the rolls the yamato was decent/normal, same with the <mark>Neo Tokyo</mark>, nothing really special (ie. skippable). the service was extremely good as our water cups rarely ran low and the manager was very helpful in getting the bill comped. \n\nall in it wasn't too bad of a restaurant however it is unlikely one that i would pay for especially with the number of other foods in vegas.", 
            "this restaurant is a chain and was pretty good.\n\nbeing a girls weekend away from home, we started off with their cocktail tree which is $70, but totally worth it! then we ordered otsumami which is an assortment of edamame, <mark>Green Bean Tempura</mark>, and shishito which was really good. their aioli sauce had a hint of truffles and a strong garlic taste but wasn't too over powering and made it really good with the <mark>Green Bean Tempura</mark>.\n\nafter that we had the <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark> that had bibb lettuce, tobanjan alioli, black truffle vinaigrette and in my opinion was only average. for my entree i had the miso-marinated chilean <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> and that was really, really good. very moist, tender, juicy and not fishy at all. it's everything you could wish your fish to be. the portion was a little small, but it was oh, so good!! i also had the <mark>Samba Strip</mark> roll which had <mark>Half Maine Lobster</mark>, mango, tomato, chive, crispy rice, soy paper, peanut curry and i thought it was alright. but for the price and how much lobster they gave us, it was really worth it.  the last thing i had was their <mark>Neo Tokyo</mark> roll that had yellowfin tuna, tempura flake, aji panca, which is also really good. \n\nmy overall experience was only a 3 stars because they said they were really busy that night (but didn't look that way to me because there were at least 5 empty tables in front of us) and they sat us in a corner and our waiter was a complete douche and couldn't get our order right nor could he remember what we ordered and came back on several occasions to reconfirm what we ordered. the manager there was also dumb and tried to help out only to make things worse because he asked us what we wanted to drink and didn't even bring our drinks and completely forgot about us. \n\nin the end, i'd come back cause the food was good, but hopefully i'll get better service next time.",

            "the ambiance of the restaurant was breathtaking as 3 fellow diners and i walked in. we had made reservations a few hours in advance on a busy saturday night (the night before 4th of july) so we understood that it would be a few minutes of a wait. while we waited, we sat near the waiting/bar area and our to-be waitress asked us if we wanted to order drinks. we ordered drinks while we waited for our table and our waitress brought them to us in the lounge area we were sitting in. i got the strawberry-tini which was really fruity and yummy. \n\nwe got seated after about 10 minutes. i will admit, the menu seemed slightly pricey but it's vegas and you can't expect restaurants not to be pricey. i ordered the <mark>Neo Tokyo</mark> roll and it came with 8 small pieces but was the best sushi i've ever had! for $15, it wasn't bad at all because i also decided to order a side of <mark>Coconut Rice</mark> which was delicious and only $5. the drink did ring up to be $12 but overall it wasn't bad for the great dining experience. my fellow diners loved their dishes as well. 2 of them ordered a 4-course dinner for $50, which is customized to your liking based on what preferences and allergies you tell the waitress you have and she kind of surprises you. the last diner ordered the kobe beef sushi and he enjoyed it a lot. it came with delicately sliced raw kobe beef wrapped around the sushi which looked amazing.\n\noverall a very fun dining experience!", 
            "thursday night. 9pm. \nour reservations were honored to the minute and the man who runs the show, mike durovsik, at once made us feel not just like welcomed guests but old friends.\n\nmy fiance and i were indulged with a 9 course specialized server's omakase. the food was superb, and the service exceeds even the best definitions of accommodating. \n\nour charming and attentive server asked immediately how adventurous we were willing to get, and since we had no objections to anything particular, our meal immediately commenced.\n\nfirst was the otsumami, three small dishes: <mark>Green Bean Tempura</mark> with a creamy truffle aoli dipping sauce (incredible), shishito peppers charcoal grilled and just the right amount of spicy, as well as edamame sprinkled with sea salt.\n\nnext came hamachi (yellowtail) tacos paired with a fizzing sort of vinegarette (spicy aji panca) on the side to top it off- this was filled with so much flavour it literally forced my eyes to roll back. a real treat that i'd highly  reccommend.\n\nat this point it was quite apparent that service and timing was top notch. the bottle of sake we brought was being chilled tableside and water never fell below the 2/3rds mark. as the bottle chilled we tasted two different cocktails-  kumori, a cucumber cocktail with shochu and nigori which was refreshing, easy, and delicious.  alongside was the ever popular nina fresa, a strawberry cocktail with vodka. both made for easy, yet yummy drinking.\n\ntheir mushroom toban yaki was divinely creamy- we got ours with bincho tan grilled lamb on top which paired quite nicely with those garlic chips. their were five different kinds of perfectly cooked mushrooms in the mix, and all around it made for a <mark>Uni</mark> filling appetizer. my fiances words: that fu**ing amazing lamb dish ;)\n\nthe sashimi tiradito i'm always raving about came next. still on a midblowing level, i noticed that their are different flavour notes (though served with the same ingredients) for the nyc location and the las vegas one. so if you think you've had it before, you haven't. though different, the fish is always immensely fresh and the taste accents are truly wonderful. my favorite is the kanpachi since i'm a sucker for yuzu (japanese citrus) and my fiance was a big fan of the hamachi- if you're torn, go with the assortment of all four and you won't have any regrets.\n\noff the robata grill (bincho tan charcoal) came the most decadant <mark><mark>Alaskan King Crab</mark> Leg</mark> imaginable- our taste buds were literally in shock from the mastermind talents of chef oscar toro. bedded atop rock salt, the crab was creamy, fell apart smoothly, and the flavours enhanced the entire piece of already fresh seafood. a seasonal dish that may not always be available... so wonderful. if they don't have it on menu, go for the spiny lobster.\n\nalso from from the robata grill we enjoyed the miso glazed <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> with baby corn. again, this dish can be done so many different ways at different high end japanese restaurants- but sushi samba's brazillian take really heightens the tastes.\n\nask for the freshest oysters of the day- you can go with <mark><mark>Osetra Caviar Imperial 20g</mark> 20g</mark>, paired with yuzu jelly and lemon, or a more contemporary take which chef oscar toro will create specially for that oyster.- both ways are unforgettable.\n\nmy absolute favorite dish is the kobe ishiyaki. you grill fresh pieces of perfectly marbleized kobe tableside 3-5 seconds on each side on an extremely hot river stone. you get 4-5 sauces and and array of salts to mix up the taste buds for you- absolutely the most decadently delicious dish. whenever i see this i must have it, and sushi samba's is the best i've had. not enough people indulge in this and you must must must!!! \n\nour sushi/sashimi platter was fresh and wonderful- exquisite. we got the <mark>Neo Tokyo</mark> and the <mark>El Topo</mark> rolls- <mark>Neo Tokyo</mark> has tuna and a bit of spicy to it, and the <mark>El Topo</mark> is served warm- a surprising aspect, but the melted mozzarella is such a <mark>Uni</mark> addition. it's like the movie \"<mark>El Topo</mark>\" you must try/ see both! \n\nfor dessert we went with mochi; a soft and chewy japanese dessert that is <mark><mark>Osetra Caviar Imperial 20g</mark> 20g</mark> not overly sweet. sushi samba adds ice cream to the center and offers all the best flavours. \n\nby the end of our meal and a finished bottle of sake, we were both more than pleasantly buzzed and satiated with an incredible meal. \n\n\n**************\nbottom line, if you are trying to decide between nobu and sushi samba, pass on nobu and put some samba in your seafood!!\n\nthank you again mike and oscar for such a wonderful night!!", 
            "my well-traveled, hapa popolo friend put it best when she opinioned that vegas has the biggest collection of restaurants in the el mundo.  \nwhat makes sushi samba \"woohoo! as good as it gets!\" for this humble 3am diner on the strip is our excellent server, tanice.  she hunted down off-menu nigori mura (aka the sake milkshake), and eclectic-sized our <mark>Samba Strip</mark> and <mark>Neo Tokyo</mark> rolls because we like a drop kick in our aguacate culture. gochisosama.\n\nbig japanese bows & brazilian butt jiggles also for: \n-yellow tail taquitos\n-peru's corn kernels (my people call it maize)  \n-tataki skewers\n- no blue fin tuna until they won't be extinct. \n\nwe vote they also \"pass on the <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>\" which is also over-fished.

            "now that i've been here 4 times, i feel i can give an accurate review.  this place makes me feel very torn.  here's the deal:\n\nthings to rave about:\n-cool energy in the place. interesting decor, sleek seating areas, random stuff on the tvs to watch, nice music.\n-interesting flavors.  not all their dishes are hits, but they are not afraid to try interesting things with some of their ceviches, tiraditos, etc.  the <mark>Neo Tokyo</mark> roll is tasty an their yamato roll is very, very good (tuna, <mark>Foie Gras</mark>, osetra, and gold leaf).  \n-there always seems to be a nice manager checking on us, refolding napkins, etc.\n\nthings that really turn me off about this place:\n-it's soooooo expensive!  i'm by no means cheap and am willing to pay for good food that is well prepared.  the yamato roll, for example, is expensive for a roll, but not for the yumminess of the <mark>Foie Gras</mark>.  but, some of their other food is just ok, very small portioned, and way overpriced.  the drinks are weak and are also overpriced. it's like the place thinks it's too cool for its own good.  i feel ripped off every time i go. i might not go anymore, to be honest.\n-douchiness on nye.  we dropped by for lunch and were presented with a special menu, cutting off nearly everything normal and adding in some $30+ (charged per person) \"small plates.\"  there were no hand rolls or cut rolls available, even with 5 sushi chefs at the bar.  and, to top it off, the orders of sushi are for one piece. one piece of sushi for 5 bucks! no sushi place does that mess!\n\nwhile i do enjoy some of the food, i don't enjoy the feeling of being ripped off by a place that really thinks it's so cool that it can.  if i'm going to spend $100 for lunch, there are better places with better food.",

            "i almost want to give this a 5. near oh my god moment, but not quite.\n\nthis is a little misleading. i swear this came up under \"chinese\" on yelp while we were looking for something (in a group <mark><mark>Assortment of Four</mark></mark>) but this is definitely not chinese. it's japanese brazilian fusion, which i had never had, but was awesome. the menu is a bid daunting, but the waitress offered to bring out a tasting menu for us, based on the common questions like, \"are you ok with raw fish,\" \"do you have allergies,\" \"how do you eat red meat,\" etc. this was helpful - usually i'm not fazed by the large menu, but for some reason i was having problems focusing. worth mentioning they say up front that they'll take back anything we don't like, no charge, and they do ask for a budget to keep them in line.\n\nwhat we got was really pretty exceptional. gyoza steamed and pan fried, hamachi taquitos (not what you're thinking - not the deep fried rolls, but little taco shells filled with hamachi sashimi), seared tuna with baby greens and crunchy salt, and portabella fries with kabocha aioli. all sounds fancy, all really good.\n\nthen a warm plate - grilled <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> with a sweet glaze, <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> (not their a5 w<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark>, which we were offered for an upcharge, but declined) and <mark><mark>Alaskan King Crab</mark> Leg</mark>, all with a side of elote. the bass was good - tender and flaky, and i like the glaze. but it was crazy overpowered by the beef and crab. firstly, the beef was far superior to what we had at n9ne. tender, flavorful, and with a great salt and pepper crust on the outside, served with a little pile of powdered chile for dipping. and the crab was that near oh my god moment. an *enormous* <mark><mark>Alaskan King Crab</mark> Leg</mark>, brushed with a sort of thick butter sauce, served piping hot. wow, this was exceptional. and while i guess i should expect it, points to the restaurant for realizing that serving a filet and a <mark><mark>Alaskan King Crab</mark> Leg</mark> family style to diners that have only chopsticks required that you slice things up in to nice little bite sized pieces.\n\nfinally, sushi. their <mark>Neo Tokyo</mark> roll, which is their version of the <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark>, a hamachi roll with spicy crab and avocado on top, a tuna roll with asparagus, dusted with wasabi, and an assortment of sashimi and nigiri. as well as a hot roll - something covered in melted mozzarella, crispy onions and a sweet sauce. all of the cold rolls were good - i especially liked their <mark>Neo Tokyo</mark> roll. the sashimi was also very good, but the hot roll...i could do without. it was in interesting twist - not just the cheese was hot, but the entire roll, rice and all. however, the cheese and a heaping helping of onion and sauce overpowered whatever might have been inside. this was about the only misstep i could find.\n\nthe atmosphere is odd - lots of pounding techno music, along with an odd video collage (on many many video screens) of brazilian beach babes, bullet trains, brazilian slums, and japanese salarymen trudging to their soul-murdering jobs. not sure what they were going for. but whatever.\n\ngreat spot - chinese though it wasn't, we all were appropriately full when it was over (not hungry, no stuffed) and we all agreed we'd be back. the total bill, excluding drinks, was probably about $65 per person. i loved the mix of appetizers, hot beef and seafood, and sushi. if you're going with a group, this is a fun way to try stuff without having to worry about reading a menu.",

            "i am so glad we had the chance to dine at sushisamba our last night in vegas! our waiter michael was fantastic and made the entire experience that much more memorable. we literally loved everything we ordered. be sure to make a reservation because it gets very busy, and if you're celebrating anything let the hostess know. we were celebrating our wedding anniversary and they gave us a free small dessert.\n\nsmall plates:\n<mark>Seared W<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> Beef</mark> goyza - do not miss this! it was incredible - every table around us had also ordered it and we were in unanimous agreement.\n\nyellowtail crispy taquitos - light & delicious with an asian dressing on the greens.\n\nrobata:\nribeye - it's described as spicy but it's not, just has subtle spic flavoring and was very tender.\n\n<mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> - phenomenal. there's a reason it's the most popular thing on the menu. melts in your mouth with an amazing miso glaze.\n\nsamba rolls:\n<mark>Neo Tokyo</mark>: similar to a <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> roll flavor but with tuna both inside and on top of the roll. fresh and great flavor.\n\ndessert: \nfried doughnuts with cream dipping sauce - oh my goodness, sooo good. not a light dessert (fried dough) but ah-ma-zing.\n\nsince we were celebrating our wedding anniversary, they gave us a free small dessert of green tea ice cream pops dipped in chocolate with pop candy crust, which was cool and refreshing.\n\nwe will definitely be back on our next trip!", 
            "i came for a bachelorette party last week on friday night around 11pm. my review is probably (ok definitely) biased because i was in such a bad mood at having to wait until 11pm to eat dinner. however, as you might imagine, 5 girls using one bathroom getting ready to go out in vegas is a production equal to cirque de solei that takes upward of 3 hours. but whatever we finally made it after a 15 minute, mile long cab ride down the strip from the cosmo to the palazzo hotel.  the restaurant was super dark (why don't they turn some lights on?) with huge tvs which were super loud. per the usual at many \"sceney\" type restaurants you could barely here the people across the table from you. \n\nwe got seated no problem as the restaurant was dead except for two or three big groups getting wasted in booths and a few lonely looking stragglers at the bar. our server was friendly but seemed to constantly be in a rush, although to go where i do not know. there seemed to be a ton of bus boys but very few wait staff. he could probably sense our frustration so he promptly brought out a wrought iron tree full of pink drinks. whether or not they had liquor was the only question (answer: not enough.) so we got a range of drinks, the best of which was a cucumber lime martini with vodka. after the night's beginning, i opted with straight vodka and diet coke.\n\nfor food we got a lot. some  memorable dishes were the <mark>Neo Tokyo</mark> roll with tuna which was solid, <mark>Heirloom Tomato Salad</mark> with sweet cilantro dressing, <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark>, <mark>Mushroom Tobanyaki</mark>, and sweet <mark>Coconut Rice</mark> side. my fave dish of all was the <mark>Heirloom Tomato Salad</mark> which was pricey but enough to share between 3 people. the rock shrimp was good but cliched, same as you would get anywhere else. the <mark>Mushroom Tobanyaki</mark> was interesting but not to my taste.  sadly we did not get dessert. \nin conclusion, i can definitely say i hope i will never be back with another bachelorette party, although i would not mind returning otherwise.", 
            "literally my favorite restaurant ever, let alone vegas!!!\nits absolutely perfect--japanese peruvian fusion with the freshest fish, most delicious creative rolls, beautiful decor, & outstanding service!!!!\ni definitely recomend the <mark>Neo Tokyo</mark> rolls, carnival roll, <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> with <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark> (amazing), kanpachi, & everything else...so good!!!!!!!", 
            "sushi samba in las vegas is always a favorite, and my wife and my dinner there last night was another spectacular experience. the food, service, and decor are always top notch. the usuals  (all four tiraditos, tuna taquitos, samba tea, waygu gyoza, miso butterscotch <mark>Berkshire Pork Belly</mark>, aji amarillo chicken robata, ceviche, and <mark>Neo Tokyo</mark> roll) were mind blowing.", 
            "super fresh fish.  had the sake / hamachi / hotate  nigiri.  all of it was really good.  had the <mark>Neo Tokyo</mark> roll, super good too.  my faves were still probably the nigiri.  pricey.  nigiri comes in singles...   but so good.  great service, waiter kept coming back to ask if i needed anything.", 
            "on a hungry sunday night we stumbled toward this oasis of fish, beats, and peeps. \n\nstarted off with a yellow tail taco that was the perfect mix of savory, spicy, and scrumptious. next was a <mark>Seared W<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> Beef</mark> gyoza that was super juicy on a bed of pumpkin puree that offset the fatty gyoza incredibly well. \n\nfor the rolls we got the <mark>Neo Tokyo</mark> which had a decent amount of fish and was quite tasty. the <mark>El Topo</mark> (or something like that) had an interesting concept with fried onions, melted mozzarella, and salmon, but was probably the most \"meh\" dish of the night since the fried onion took over the taste of the roll and the salmon was cooked--it was more like a baked salmon dish with lotsa cheese than a fresh sushi roll. \n\nthe winner of the night, however, was certainly the yamato. decadent in its description and decadent in execution the buttery beef created a wonderful texture as the <mark>Foie Gras</mark> melted on the tongue. my friend liked it so much that he ordered a whole second roll for himself. if i wasn't so full i would have been tempted to do the same. \n\nall in all great service and for 40ish bucks a great great meal in vegas.", 
            "one of the many reasons i love the palazzo is the creepy-when-you-think-about-it facts that you can have a week long vacay and never really go outside. one of the other reasons i like the joint is... sushisamba. \n\nall fusion isn't created equal and most of what's deemed fusion in the multi-billion dollar tourist traps still doesn't cut it as top notch cuisine... but in three rotations over the years, the one thing i can say is that they've consistently delivered a good experience.  and that's more than i can say for a few others that are no longer at the palazzo.   it's also consistently noisy... do with that what you will. \n\nfavorites from the menu... <mark>Moqueca Mista</mark> (kinda hard to mess up fish stew with good ingredients ) and the <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> are my favorites of the full entries, which i wouldn't recommend on a first visit.  save big plates for your second or third go round.  almost anything with the w<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> is a hit; i think sushisamba drives the south american flavors home using fine japanese beef.  but if it works... \n\nthe yamato roll... epic as it is... to me, is **almost** overkill.  super indulgent <mark>Foie Gras</mark> and w<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> are almost a taste bud assault.   but at the same time, you have to try it-share it. the sa\\u00f5 paulo and the <mark>Neo Tokyo</mark> are my favorites here.   the <mark>Samba Strip</mark> is also pretty awesome.  again, pile enough good things together and see what happens. \n\nthe so so and not so on the menu... if anything ... rock shrimp (discontinued) and tiger <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark>.   mojitos are so so...( to me) as well.   the robata squid was literally hit and miss; had it once and it was great... and the next time... just rubber. \n\nall in all, come here with good company, a serious appetite and charge it to the room...i prefer early lunch or just after midnight."

            "alright, now were getting to the good stuff. \n\nand by \"good\" i mean un-fucking-believable. yea, i said it. unreal. never have i wanted to pick up and move to vegas so much in all of my life, but i'm thinking about it after the dinner i had at sushisamba's new ultra lounge, sugarcane. this is an incredible statement for me because for one, i can only take vegas in small doses, and two, i despise the heat. so having said that you can believe me when i say that i love absolutely everything about sushisamba, the brazilian/peruvian/japanese fusion restaurant at the palazzo. \n\nwhere do i begin?\n\noh yes, holy mary mother of god, i've died and gone to heaven...\n\na friend of mine is the publicist for this new restaurant, as well as the brand spanking new, sugarcane. she hooked up a dinner reservation for me and some friends so that we could celebrate my good friend's birthday in style. upon our (late) arrival we were greeted warmly by the wait staff, as they explained to us that our party would be the very first members of the public to sit down to dinner in their brand new ultra lounge. as we walked through the dimly lit hallway, past the dj booth and dance floor, and into the dining area portion of sugarcane we were immediately taken back by the overall design concept of the space. i\"m gonna do my best to do it justice but i would highly recommend a trip here to experience for yourself because it is just too complex for words...\n\nthe walls are covered with graffiti-style murals of samurais and japanese script, the dance floor has a canvas like screen that wraps around the circular pods that make up the women's bathrooms (see pics) where they project abstract imagery to coincide with the music playing. the dj that night was claudio who i wanted to put in my pocket and take home because the music was just that dope. there are multi-colored glass cylinders that hang from the ceiling and beams of light (see pics) that separate the dance floor from the dining area that change from red to orange to white that create a truly magnificent effect. \n\nthe food and service is on a level that is even harder to explain - it was incredible. our waiter anthony took such good care of us we felt as though we were old friends by the time we left. of course, we were the first to be seated and the last to leave, so i guess if you spend enough time with your waiter (four hours) you begin to feel like family. our sake sommelier was a hilariously funny girl (i forgot her name) and very helpful and knowledgeable when describing our sake selections. we ended up choosing a bottle with gold leaf cherry blossoms there were supposedly good luck if you found them floating in your drink. \n\nour table decided to order the signature sushisamba 7-course omakase ($70 per person) as our dinner selection. anthony asked us if we had any food allergies or other special requests before going back to the kitchen to get our party started. our first course was a selection of appetizers (see pics) which included the kobe beef carpaccio with <mark>Mixed <mark>Wild Mushrooms</mark></mark>, seared ahi tuna on a tiny bed of spinach, and (my favorite) tiny ceviche fish tacos with a chili foam sauce that was amazing! next up was the best snow crab i have ever tasted, <mark>Filet Mignon</mark>, duck, chilan <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> (unreal), grilled tomatoes, fish jowel (i forget what kind) and the most beautiful sashimi plate i've ever seen/tasted. just when we thought we couldn't eat any more came the sushi course. a stand out roll was the kobe beef wrapped roll with (from what i can remember) a <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark>, cucumber and avocado center. as we sat back in our booth contemplating exactly how we were planning on walking out of there, anthony presented the birthday girl with an incredible chocolate fondue plate (see pics) complete with japanese-style sesame rice krispies, japanese cake, homemade marshmallows, and a selection of fruit. there were also mini fruit tacos with both mango and banana, with a chocolate mousse and caram<mark>El Topo</mark>. \n\ndo you see what i'm talking about?????\n\nhere's the rundown....\n\nparty <mark><mark>Assortment of Four</mark></mark>:\nfirst round of cocktails (on the house)\nseveral cocktails to follow\nbottle of premium sake\n7- course omakase dinner for four ($70 each)\nafter dinner cocktails\ndivine dessert platter\n\ntotal bill: approx $600\n\nnot bad i'd say. not bad at all. \n\nall in all, i plan to go back to visit several times over. anyone who stumbles upon this place should consider themselves lucky to be in the presence of such foodie excellence. this dinner made our entire trip, and made for a very, very happy birthday girl. \n\nsushisamba: the wait staff, the owner, the managers, the dj. you rock my rock-n-roll world.",

            "i think the reason why i put off this review for 2 months is that i've been afraid of not praising this place enough with what i'm about to say in a couple of lines. first of all, thanks to my procrastination, i've forgotten the incredibly friendly manager's name who treated us newly legals to 3 chu-cumber shots, which, btw, go down ridiculously well. (maybe his name was anthony...?) anyway, he also hooked us up with a bouncer at tryst and we got in without having to wait! so the staff and their service is really really amazing. i'm pretty positive if you go there (soon), there will still be this omg-drool-with-my-eyes-like-it's-possible waiter there ready and waiting to fill up your glass of water... or take your order... or ravage - no, that's it. \n\nenough about the awesome service, the food was also really really amazing. it's a brazilian/japanese fusion type restaurant, but i'm not really big on brazilian unless it's like a churascaria, so we went with mainly japanese type dishes.

            "was staying at the palazzo and kept passing by sushi samba.  we came one night when it was fairly busy, and was trying to decide if we wanted to eat here.  we asked the hostess if we could see a menu.  she said yes and went to attend to her other duties.  after about 5 minutes of her ignoring us we left, annoyed.  the menus are right behind the front desk.\n\nwe walked by again during the day time, when it was mostly empty and decided to have lunch.  my girlfriend and i shared the ribeye teriyaki bento box ($18) and the <mark>El Topo</mark> roll ($14).  the <mark>El Topo</mark> roll had cheese, jalepenos and salmon which doesnt sound like it would go together, but was amazingly good.  the ribeye steak in the bento box was a generous portion for lunch.  \n\nover all, i would go to sushi samba again, as i have seen it in miami, chicago and new york.  im excited to try the rest of their specialty rolls",

            "what is there not to love about brazilians?\n\nbrazilian bbq, brazilian wax, brazilian models, and brazilian fusion.\n\nsushi samba is ahhh-mazing. i honestly thought the bf was overhyping the place and thought it would be mediocre, but i was surprised by the quality of the food and how delicious everything was!\n\nour waitress regina was nice and very bubbly. she made our dining experience at sushi samba great. instead of ordering random items off the menu, we chose the personalized prix fixe menu. basically, you tell your waiter/waitress what you like/dislike and the price limit per person and they basically bring out items that they think you would like.  if you don't like it, the waiter/waitress takes full responsibility for it and doesn't charge you. \n\nbetween the 3 of us, we had:\n- edamame: i'm not a fan of edamame so i rarely eat it and don't really care for it.\n- yellowtail crispy taquitos: this is a cold dish and it's like a sushi taco. the taquito had lemongrass, avocado, and aji panca miso. definitely recommend it!\n- <mark>Tuna Tataki</mark>: also another cold dish. very light and it had white asparagus, heart of palm, avocado, tatsoi, and citrus soy. i love anything with tuna in it so i enjoyed this a lot. \n- mushroom toban yaki w/ <mark>Filet Mignon</mark>: omg delicious! this came in a stone pot and had a bunch of <mark>Mixed <mark>Wild Mushrooms</mark></mark> and <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> in a delicious broth. \n- sashimi tiradito (yellowtail, kanpachi, tuna, and salmon): i didn't care too much for this dish. it was good but some of the sauce that accompanied the sashimi didn't blow me away. the yellowtail had a jalapeno and lemongrass sauce, the kanpachi had a yuzu, black truffle oil, and sea salt sauce, the tuna had a yuzu soy, hickory oil, and toasted garlic sauce, and the salmon had a maiz cancha, lime zest, and ponzu sauce. \n- <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> w/ a side of <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark>: this had to be one of the best <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> i've ever had in my life. it was cooked perfectly and had the perfect buttery, melt in your mouth texture. it was also marinated in a sweet sauce, but it wasn't too overpowering. the side of corn complemented the <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> very well.\n- <mark>Neo Tokyo</mark> roll, carnival roll, <mark>El Topo</mark> roll - i'm not the biggest fan of rolls and these rolls were a bit disappointing. especially since it came out last after all the really delicious dishes. i tried each of the rolls, but they weren't memorable.\n- carrot cake: oooooommmmmmmgggggggg! best carrot cake, ever. it was served with brown butter ice cream, cinnamon cream, rainbow carrot chip, and orange reduction. i seriously wanted to lick the plate after i was done!\n\nthe total per person (not including alcohol, tip, or tax) was about $65/per person. totally worth it! \n\nif you ever decide to try sushi samba, skip the rolls and go for the good stuff! i definitely recommend the personalized prix fixe menu.", 
            "japanese, peruvian, and brazilian fusion. i'd think that intrigue alone would be enough to bring anyone to sushi samba.\n\ni'll have to admit that i was nervous when our knowledgeable and friendly server began talking about the three different kitchens, the different ways to order...it all sounded way too complicated. (to be honest, i just wanted to fill my stomach so that i'd be able to drink later!) luckily, one of our friends is a sushi samba master, and he did all of the ordering for our table. \n\ni pretty much loved everything - if only for the novelty of it all - but a few stand-out dishes were:\n1) yellowtail ceviche taquito: they looked like little yellowtail and guacemole tacos. somehow it all worked...\n2) yellowtail tiradito: kinda like a ceviche? yellowtail, jalepeno, and lemongrass - i'm definitely a fan of sour and spicy.\n3) fresh oysters and <mark><mark>Jumbo Shrimp</mark></mark>: no explanations needed.\n4) <mark>El Topo</mark> roll: salmon, jalepeno, melted cheese, and crispy onions\n\ni also would recommend getting a side of <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark> (which went along with our churrasco plate) just to see how huge those kernels are! it's kind of ridiculous. anyway, not only was the food great, but the service was among the best - they even have a \"sake sommelier\", so to speak. the place itself is energetic, contemporary, and very, very vegas. i can't wait to go back!", 
            "it is very unfor<mark>Tuna</mark> that the sushi samba in las vegas is the closest spot to the los angeles area! located on the second floor of the palazzo hotel, this place takes sushi to a whole new level. it was my last day in vegas and decided to try it out with some company for lunch. the atmosphere was quite enjoyable! loved the ambiance. the only bad thing i would have to mention is the lack of service, though it could have been due to the world cup finals contributing to the poor service. nevertheless, this place has delicious sushi.\n\ncombined total including tip: $100 (4 people)\noriginality & taste: 5/5\nservice: 2/5\nprice: $$\n\nsuggested samba rolls:\n- <mark>El Topo</mark> ($14): my favorite. absolutely delicious! never had anything like it. fresh salmon, rectangular-shaped sushi (as opposed to your typical round-cuts), melted mozzarella cheese & crispy onions toppers\n- <mark>Rainbow Dragon</mark> roll ($15): freshwater eel, mango, red bell pepper, avocado. need i say more?\n- spicy yellowtail roll ($6): fresh yellowtail topped with just the right amount of spicy sauce", 
            "thursday night. 9pm. \nour reservations were honored to the minute and the man who runs the show, mike durovsik, at once made us feel not just like welcomed guests but old friends.\n\nmy fiance and i were indulged with a 9 course specialized server's omakase. the food was superb, and the service exceeds even the best definitions of accommodating. \n\nour charming and attentive server asked immediately how adventurous we were willing to get, and since we had no objections to anything particular, our meal immediately commenced.\n\nfirst was the otsumami, three small dishes: <mark>Green Bean Tempura</mark> with a creamy truffle aoli dipping sauce (incredible), shishito peppers charcoal grilled and just the right amount of spicy, as well as edamame sprinkled with sea salt.\n\nnext came hamachi (yellowtail) tacos paired with a fizzing sort of vinegarette (spicy aji panca) on the side to top it off- this was filled with so much flavour it literally forced my eyes to roll back. a real treat that i'd highly  reccommend.\n\nat this point it was quite apparent that service and timing was top notch. the bottle of sake we brought was being chilled tableside and water never fell below the 2/3rds mark. as the bottle chilled we tasted two different cocktails-  kumori, a cucumber cocktail with shochu and nigori which was refreshing, easy, and delicious.  alongside was the ever popular nina fresa, a strawberry cocktail with vodka. both made for easy, yet yummy drinking.\n\ntheir mushroom toban yaki was divinely creamy- we got ours with bincho tan grilled lamb on top which paired quite nicely with those garlic chips. their were five different kinds of perfectly cooked mushrooms in the mix, and all around it made for a <mark>Uni</mark> filling appetizer. my fiances words: that fu**ing amazing lamb dish ;)\n\nthe sashimi tiradito i'm always raving about came next. still on a midblowing level, i noticed that their are different flavour notes (though served with the same ingredients) for the nyc location and the las vegas one. so if you think you've had it before, you haven't. though different, the fish is always immensely fresh and the taste accents are truly wonderful. my favorite is the kanpachi since i'm a sucker for yuzu (japanese citrus) and my fiance was a big fan of the hamachi- if you're torn, go with the assortment of all four and you won't have any regrets.\n\noff the robata grill (bincho tan charcoal) came the most decadant <mark><mark>Alaskan King Crab</mark> Leg</mark> imaginable- our taste buds were literally in shock from the mastermind talents of chef oscar toro. bedded atop rock salt, the crab was creamy, fell apart smoothly, and the flavours enhanced the entire piece of already fresh seafood. a seasonal dish that may not always be available... so wonderful. if they don't have it on menu, go for the spiny lobster.\n\nalso from from the robata grill we enjoyed the miso glazed <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> with baby corn. again, this dish can be done so many different ways at different high end japanese restaurants- but sushi samba's brazillian take really heightens the tastes.\n\nask for the freshest oysters of the day- you can go with <mark><mark>Osetra Caviar Imperial 20g</mark> 20g</mark>, paired with yuzu jelly and lemon, or a more contemporary take which chef oscar toro will create specially for that oyster.- both ways are unforgettable.\n\nmy absolute favorite dish is the kobe ishiyaki. you grill fresh pieces of perfectly marbleized kobe tableside 3-5 seconds on each side on an extremely hot river stone. you get 4-5 sauces and and array of salts to mix up the taste buds for you- absolutely the most decadently delicious dish. whenever i see this i must have it, and sushi samba's is the best i've had. not enough people indulge in this and you must must must!!! \n\nour sushi/sashimi platter was fresh and wonderful- exquisite. we got the <mark>Neo Tokyo</mark> and the <mark>El Topo</mark> rolls- <mark>Neo Tokyo</mark> has tuna and a bit of spicy to it, and the <mark>El Topo</mark> is served warm- a surprising aspect, but the melted mozzarella is such a <mark>Uni</mark> addition. it's like the movie \"<mark>El Topo</mark>\" you must try/ see both! \n\nfor dessert we went with mochi; a soft and chewy japanese dessert that is <mark><mark>Osetra Caviar Imperial 20g</mark> 20g</mark> not overly sweet. sushi samba adds ice cream to the center and offers all the best flavours. \n\nby the end of our meal and a finished bottle of sake, we were both more than pleasantly buzzed and satiated with an incredible meal. \n\n\n**************\nbottom line, if you are trying to decide between nobu and sushi samba, pass on nobu and put some samba in your seafood!!\n\nthank you again mike and oscar for such a wonderful night!!", 
            "amazing and <mark>Uni</mark> peruvian + japanese + brazilian combination!  the location is beautiful, we had a few pisco sours and a caipirinha (yum!) at the bar to start and then moved inside for our dinner reservation.  we are all peruvian and love sushi so this combination totally hit the spot!!!  all of the food was delicious, and i especially enjoyed the green envy roll with aji amarillo and <mark>Neo Tokyo</mark> roll with aji panca.\n\nwe got:\nyellowtail tiradito\nyellowtail ceviche\nbeef anticuchos (with <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark>)\n<mark>Neo Tokyo</mark> roll (yellowfin tuna, tempura flake, aji panca)\n<mark>El Topo</mark> roll (salmon, jalape\\u00f1o, shiso leaf, fresh melted mozzarella, crispy onion, sounds like a weird combo but we loved it!)\ngreen envy roll (tuna, salmon, asparagus, wasabi pea crust, aji amarillo-key lime mayo)\n\n-1 star for $$$",

            "being that this restaurant is a fusion of peruvian, japanese and brazilian cuisine i was definitely interested in going there.  we ordered a bunch of dishes tapas style - <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> with <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark>, quinotto, chicken anticuchos, yellowtail ceviche and <mark>El Topo</mark> roll.  food was pretty flavorful and creative,  being a true fan of peruvian cuisine it was a little off especially the ceviche but <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> with <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark> was the favorite all around.  mixed drinks were great especially the pisco sours and caiprinhas.  overall great place for tapas, most portions are small.", 
            "my opinion/side note - i dont think its their sushi that makes this a good place to eat. but its the dishes that are not other sushi restaurant menus that makes it worth the cost.\n\nthis place is really good, only if you order the right things, because ordering something bad can cost you a pretty penny. i have been here twice and the 2nd time was much better because we all knew what we liked. \n\nthe chilean <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> on the robata grill section was probably my favorite rendition of chilean <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>. our waiter said the robata grill costs $1000 a day to operate? something like that. but wow it was good. you have to order off of this part of the menu if you are a fan of grilled food.\nprobably the only time i felt like a winner in vegas all weekend, just playing, kinda, lol.\n\nthe yellowfin taquitos were so <mark>Uni</mark>, and the foam chili sauce that came with it was the perfect compliment.\n\n<mark>El Topo</mark> - good but not great. table loved it though.\n\n<mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark> with black truffle aoili - if i ever make my dream of opening up a restaurant come true - this will be the first item on the menu. wowwww. it made a shrimp convert out of 1 the people at our table. but really how can u not like shrimp?\n\n\n-p", 
            "chilean <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> skewers with miso - absolutely delicious!  the <mark><mark>Jumbo Shrimp</mark></mark> with passionfruit ceviche -- original and delightful.  my husband's favorite dish was the <mark>Tuna Tataki</mark> .  we came here because i had a taste for sushi and it was the highest ranked by yelpers.  when we arrived, the bar atmosphere caused us to question the yelp reviews but after eating we agree.  the sushi rolls aren't that great (we tried the <mark>Samba Strip</mark> and <mark>El Topo</mark>) but they weren't horrible.  the servers are familiar with the entire menu so if you don't have a specific taste for something, feel free to ask them for their suggestion. they'll have a ton.  also, their drinks are good but lean away from being sweet.  i had to have them muddle more sugar and mint to flavor up my drink a little more because it just tasted like rum with a little mint when they first brought it out.  this is a tapas place so you can easily order 4 plates per person which can get pricey.  but highly recommend for their chilean <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> skewers.  i haven't had <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> this good since g. garvin's restaurant in west los angeles closed a few years ago.  outstanding.",

            "these 5 stars goes to the lady who was so damn good at her job by fulfilling every aspect of our dining experience that the food was more like a plus. i wish i got her name to credit her but we were a party of 8 girls staggering in late in high heels for our dear friend's bachelorette reserved dinner on a saturday night a week ago.\nwe got the run down quickly on doing their style of \"omakase\" after mentioning we had a show and had to finish by 9pm. we gave her free rein with a price per person between $30 to $40.\nnow, i was the only one who had been here before for the same concept so i was expecting the same good service and food. so i discreetly asked the lady server to make sure to add the miso <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> skewers. she happily replied, \"i gotchu girl!\" \nwe were then offered the extensive sake and wine menu, which we had to forgo. and one of the girls almost ordered the cucumber martini but didn't.  \nafter the time it took for a buzzed dude to walk over, show us his awesome swim trunks, (clearly forgetting to dress his bottoms to match his sharp shirt), wink and share a charming smile, and then leave...our appetizers were presented by a team of 3 servers.\n- otsumami: trio of edamame, tempura green beans with amazing truffle dip, grilled shishito pepper :)\n- pork gyozas (ok)\n- <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark> (wasn't as succulent or saucy but still good)\n\nour waters were always filled. thank you water guy!\n\nthen after enjoying our appz for about 20 mins, came out the yummiful skewers, 3 specialty rolls of sushi (could have asked for the <mark>El Topo</mark> roll but decided try the others) and an entree split by 2 plates to share. it was the teriyaki chicken with fried onions atop mashed purple potatoes. this is so yum because the chicken was juicy and flavorful!\n\nwe were having our fill and we were on schedule. then the lady server got us a surprise sake tree of their cucumber martini! also very refreshing and yum to end our meal.  we had to pack a bit of to-go and we were happy with the service. she lined our meal down the middle of our price range to about $36/person (plus tax+tip $45).\nso exceeded my last experience here!  i recommend the omakase style because the servers really do know the menu. trust!",

            "intrigued by the japanese/south american fusion going on here and the rather good yelp reviews, i ended up here with a group for a late dinner one sunday night during a recent trip to vegas. we were seated promptly at our reserved time.\n\nthe service was immediately kind of odd. our waiter did not give us menus (other than for drinks), but instead started talking about how if we had a particular budget in mind, they could send us enough food to fill that budget. butbutbut...i saw the menu online! i knew there was a menu. i wanted to be in control! would the waiter let us be in control?\n\nafter awhile yes, yes he did. we were able to secure some menus, and he then proceeded to go through the different sections of the menu with us as if we were eight years old and/or eating dinner by ourselves at a restaurant for the first time. is fusion really that scary for people?\n\nso we ordered a couple of rounds, tapas style, like we do. there were hits and misses along the way. the best stuff was in the robata area of the menu. the <mark>Berkshire Pork Belly</mark> with the butterscotch miso about slayed me with its awesomeness. the <mark>Duck Breast</mark> dish we got was also killer, with a fantastic sauce and lots of meaty, meaty mushrooms. the shishito peppers were solid, as was the sea eel we got nigiri style. it's hard to mess those two up. the yamato rolls, in all their decadence, were worth every penny.\n\nthe <mark>Seared W<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> Beef</mark> was probably the biggest miss of the evening. the menu does not list truffle oil in the dish's ingredients, but that's about all i could taste. and for me, truffle oil makes everything taste and smell rancid. not appealing. the <mark>El Topo</mark>, while quite good, was also a bit of a disappointment. i love fried onions, but they seemed to overpower here. the yellowtail sashimi also seemed a bit off, as the lemongrass sauce wasn't particularly complimentary. \n\nthe service was alright but stayed a little odd during our visit. sometimes our waiter would be absent for long periods of time, and then suddenly would be around almost too often. the place was loud, almost too loud. prices are about what you'd expect for a sushi spot on the strip. overall, i enjoyed this place, but it is easily overshadowed by the plethora of better options nearby.", 
            "perfect for date night! it's such a pretty restaurant, and they plate their dishes just as elegantly. our server was pretty attentive, although we did have a mixup with our rolls (which the manager did correct). we tried a bunch of different offerings from the menu, but these are the highlights. the green envy roll was my favorite, and we did try the <mark>El Topo</mark>...which i found too rich (mozzarella + salmon was too much...although there was a nice kick from the jalapeno). i really liked what my date was sipping on, the samba juice (can't really go wrong with anything mixed with guava juice)...my cocktail definitely packed a punch (beijo)! wish i had more room in my stomach to try more on the menu!", 
            "ever since i came here the first time i went to vegas, i've been dying to come back.\n\nthe food is so good!  i thought we just got lucky the first time we came, but as it turns out, everything we've tried on the menu thus far is delicious.\n\nambiance is classy and cool.  it's a nice location within the palazzo hotel with lots of seats.  service was also good, as my water glass was always full despite being very busy on a friday night at midnight.\n\nwe got:\n\n<mark>Moqueca Mista</mark> - shrimp, squid, <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>, coconut milk, roasted cashew, dende oil, chimichurri rice - $29 - http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sushisamba-las-vegas?select=t4jwaobhrbkbp4vr92x4ua#t4jwaobhrbkbp4vr92x4ua\n\nthis thing is the best ever.  creamy thai-style curry taste (hence coconut milk) with the delicate seafood mixed in with bits of crushed cashews, giving the dish great texture.  rice was served within the sauce mixture as shown; the rice soaked up all the sauce, making every morsel divine.  i thought after a while the dish would get too rich-tasting, but somehow i kept gobbling and gobbling until the plate was empty!\n\n<mark>El Topo</mark> sushi roll - salmon, jalape\\u00f1o, shiso leaf, fresh melted mozzerella, crispy onion - $15 (forgot to take a pic; too excited about the <mark>Moqueca Mista</mark>)\n\nvery <mark>Uni</mark> roll with interesting flavors and textures = delicious!\n\nchicken teriyaki - samba style <mark>Organic Chicken</mark>, aji amarillo, <mark>Purple Potato Mash</mark>, crispy onion - $26 (again forgot to take a pic...)\n\nwhen i saw the huge price tag i thought \"wtf?!\", especially for a seemingly simple plate as chicken teriyaki (my friend ordered this one so i had no control).  buttt i'll have to say that it was probably the best teriyaki chicken i've ever had in my life!  super juicy fillets of teriyaki chicken, pan fried (i think) to a crisp.  the sauce was perfect; not too saucy, not too dry, and definitely not overpowering to the dish.\n\nas with all finer dining restaurants, especially on the las vegas strip, i did think the prices were a little inflated.  hence the lack of that final star.  however, probably one of my favorite places to eat while in vegas.  i'll definitely hit it up again on future trips.  they have a good happy hour too (both early evening and late night), so i'll have to take advantage of that next time! :)", 
            "great ambiance, decent food.\na lot of people have recommended this restaurant, but i think it's a bit overrated. \ni love sushi.  although the sushi was well presented, they didn't taste like anything spectacular.  surprisingly not too many rolls to choose from even though they try to create some original specialty rolls.  \n\n<mark>Neo Tokyo</mark> roll - <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> inside, tuna outside.  this roll was just ok.  it just tastes like <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark>.\n\n<mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> skewers - probably our only favorite dish.  comes with corn.\n\n<mark>El Topo</mark> roll - good, sorta like a crunchy roll, crispy onions and mayo on top.\n\n<mark>Berkshire Pork Belly</mark> ramen - highly recommended by server, but a huge disappointment.  it was a failed attempt.  the broth was clear and bland.  it tasted like instant ramen with a hint of tom yum soup flavoring.  nothing like ramen at all.  \n\nsushisamba has good food, it just didn't show me anything new or exciting except that you're in a really nice restaurant, but you're paying for it.", 
            "loved my experience at sushisamba.\n\nwent there twice this weekend. loved the atmosphere. what to get:\n\nkobe beef taquitos\nyellowtail taquitos\nyellowtail ceviche (omg drool)\n<mark>El Topo</mark> roll\ngreen envy roll\n<mark>Neo Tokyo</mark> roll\nsamba chef inspiration (different types of fish sashimi with a roll)\nsake,sake,sake\nchu-cucumber martini\n\ni cannot really remember what else we ate, but everything was so delicious that we went back before we left our trip. fun place for either a group date, romantic date, or girls night out! they need to bring one to la :)", 
            "so we were headed to bouchon, but they closed at 1 for lunch/breakfast. to be honest, we didnt really expect to be on time anyway. it is vegas after all: people dont necessarily keep regular hours, our circadian rhythms were thrown off to say the least. anyway, the place was really cool, i loved the ambiance, the art on the walls and the designs. the place was a bit dim, but i wouldn't classify it as romantic or dark. there were families, younger(us) and and middle aged people so its not a party place where you would do saki bombs(there are enough of those in las vegas), nor do you have to wear a suit & tie to come in. \nthe appetizers were delicious! the side sauces accompanying them were equally great. each roll comes with 6 pieces, which was perfectly sized, the one roll that stuck with me was <mark>El Topo</mark>, that one was really tasty. friends of mine tried the wild mushroom soup--they were really happy with their choice. the price was very reasonable too. i'd definitely give this place a try if you are in the mood for some sushi.", 
            "the bf and i always eat here when we are in vegas which is at least once or twice a year. (my favorite aunt lives there) like most trendy vegas restaurants, this one is gorgeous. it is located in the palazzo hotel (my fave!!!)\n\nyou have to try their extensive list of saki and their cocktails which are broken up by country: japan, brazil, peru. samba juice is my favorite especially on a hot summer day.\n\nthis place is a little pricey but is well worth the splurge. i don't know where else you can find this type of fusion!\n\nour favorites are:\n-<mark>Berkshire Pork Belly</mark>\n-<mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> miso\n-<mark>Neo Tokyo</mark> roll\n-yamato roll\n-bobo brazil roll\n-<mark>El Topo</mark> roll\n\nadd this to your bucket list!", 
            "the manager allen was so amazing... i come here a lot! i'm a local and i must say i never get tired of it. on date night i could eat here every time! my newest obsession is the <mark>El Topo</mark>! if you are in vegas please try them out they do not disappoint!", 
            "the best sushi i have ever had....hands down. you can't go wrong with any of the rolls but my favorite was \"<mark>El Topo</mark>.\" the <mark>Blue Point Oysters</mark> were outstanding as well.  the service was excellent. can't wait to go back!", 
            "i didn't know what to expect with japanese/brazilian fusion, but this place exceeded my expectations. we tried a mixture of classic sushi, <mark>Miso Soup</mark> and some fusion dishes. the sushi was exceptionally fresh with <mark>Uni</mark> presentation. \n\nfusion dishes to try: \n<mark>El Topo</mark> (roll), which had salmon, jalape\\u00f1o, shiso leaf, fresh melted mozzerella, crispy onion. it sounds absurd and it was just that... absurdly delicious. \n\ncarnaval (roll)- shrimp, avocado, yellowtail, soy paper. this one wasn't as good as <mark>El Topo</mark>, but still offered a cool twist on a typical japanese favorite.\n\n<mark>Miso Soup</mark> - it was a great miso but with added cilantro to lend to the brazilian side of the restaurant. amazing twist!\n\n<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> - kabocha pur\\u00e9e and su-shoyu dipping sauce made this sweet, tangy, and a little spicy. we ended up ordered another batch after downing the first order in 30 seconds. so good!\n\nwe also ordered some robata items, which were great, but paled in comparison to the fusion dishes and the sushi items. this place is absolutely worth a stop! also, the price is right. we ordered a ton of food for 5 people and the bill was reasonable!", 
            "this place is overrated in my opinion. i've definitely had better sushi, and i was very disappointed. i had heard about sushi samba for many years, so i was very excited to finally try it out. \n\nfor our appetizer, we ordered the kobe beef dumplings which were very flavorful. for our main dish we ordered three different rolls: bobo brazil, <mark>El Topo</mark>, and carnaval. the carnval was my favorite, but still average, compared to other sushi i've had. the bobo brazil is topped with thin slices of <mark>Seared W<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> Beef</mark>, which i thought i would enjoy, but it was just mostly fat that you couldn't chew through. the carnaval comes with melted mozzarella cheese at the bottom, which i didn't find adding of any value to the taste. the only thing i did like at the restaurant was the non-alcoholic watermelon drink. it was sweet, sour, and refreshing which i loved. \n\ni didn't care for the ambiance or customer service either; our waitress barely came to our table and the place was too crowded. i'm glad i tried this place out, but i won't be coming back.", 
            "amazing service! the staff is absolutely incredible and the food is unbelievably delicious. highly recommend the <mark>El Topo</mark> roll. also they have a back club area that has karaoke which was a blast!", 
            "on a hungry sunday night we stumbled toward this oasis of fish, beats, and peeps. \n\nstarted off with a yellow tail taco that was the perfect mix of savory, spicy, and scrumptious. next was a <mark>Seared W<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> Beef</mark> gyoza that was super juicy on a bed of pumpkin puree that offset the fatty gyoza incredibly well. \n\nfor the rolls we got the <mark>Neo Tokyo</mark> which had a decent amount of fish and was quite tasty. the <mark>El Topo</mark> (or something like that) had an interesting concept with fried onions, melted mozzarella, and salmon, but was probably the most \"meh\" dish of the night since the fried onion took over the taste of the roll and the salmon was cooked--it was more like a baked salmon dish with lotsa cheese than a fresh sushi roll. \n\nthe winner of the night, however, was certainly the yamato. decadent in its description and decadent in execution the buttery beef created a wonderful texture as the <mark>Foie Gras</mark> melted on the tongue. my friend liked it so much that he ordered a whole second roll for himself. if i wasn't so full i would have been tempted to do the same. \n\nall in all great service and for 40ish bucks a great great meal in vegas.", 
            "i was on the fence to give them 3 or 4, so decided to go 4 because i really enjoyed the experience, but i would say it was more 3.5 overall. i like the concept of the restaurant  so that drew me in. sat at the bar last thursday and we had great service from the bartenders, a blonde gal and dark haired gentleman. the bar seats are these really comfy large round stools, which i liked! i had a really good spicy something drink with tequila, enjoyed it! we weren't super hungry so we did edamame, sashimi tiradito and two rolls.  had the yellowtail sashimi tiradito. ok, taste wise it was good, but it didn't have that super awesome super fresh melt in your mouth taste and portion size was way off for the price. i'm not upset about the 4 pieces,  i'm upset that they were so small and paper thin! i would have rather gotten another one of their awesome looking rolls for the same price.\nwe had two of their samba rolls which i enjoyed. the carnaval and <mark>El Topo</mark>. it was hard to decide on the rolls because they all sounded awesome. these were both pretty good, enjoyed the carnaval the best. the fish tasted pretty fresh as well and was not overpowered by all the other flavors going on. \ni would most likely come back and try more things on the menu.  maybe the small plates and definitely more rolls.  i also understand they have happy hour, so that would be cool to check out.", 
            "the bartenders were friendly. the food was ok. i was expecting better flavor and quality for the price, but since i got to try things during their \"samba hour,\" it was worth it. we ordered from both the happy hour and regular menus and tried the amazonia, <mark>El Topo</mark>, <mark>Rainbow Dragon</mark>, and <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark> rolls, as well as the calamari and gyoza appetizers. the japanese-south american fusion is creative, but again, the quality is ok. my favorite of the bunch was the gyoza. 5 stars if you come during the samba hour because this place is a steal in vegas with the prices for the drinks and food. outside of samba hour, the quality doesn't justify the prices, so 3 stars overall.", 
            "ss has a great, and i mean great happy hour. you have to sit at the bar, which requires going early, or getting lucky. even on a weekday. \n\ni enjoyed a great mojito, loved their hh rolls, and can't even put into words how <mark>Uni</mark> and tasty both the corn and shishito peppers are. the <mark>Purple Potato Mash</mark> is good, if you can get passed the heavy cream flavor (tell yourself you're eating your veggies...)\n\nservice was ok, despite one grumpy bartender, who still gave us quick and efficient service. \n\ncan't wait to go back. \n\n(bill for two= $110, but we ate a lot. and by a lot i mean a lot). \n\nskip the <mark>El Topo</mark> roll. cheese on rice is just wrong.", 
            "well this is a new fusion- brazilian- sushi. can't say i've tried a newer combo, but from the little brazilian treats i had here, i'd have to say it works. located in the palazzo,  this place has an upscale, trendy vibe. service, seating and d\\u00e9cor were all impressive. on to the food...\n\n\nwhen you go- reservations are recommended if you plan on stopping by after 6. the place gets uber crowded in the evenings, especially on weekends. like i said, i didn't get to try as much of the brazillian side of the menu as i'd like- i'll def concentrate more on that next time. i can speak for the waygu taquitos. could be the best single bite of anything i had in sushi samba. delightfully crisp and light, they were the best taquitos i've ever had. the sushi held it's own but they have a lot of competition in vegas (see my yellowtail review). i was impressed with the lima (shrimp, crab and avo) and the <mark>El Topo</mark> (salmon, jalapeno and mozerella!). excellent oyster menu as well. the kumamto's were delicious, but at $5 ea, not the best deal in town.\n\nall in all, i like sushi samba and will definitely be a return guest!", 
            "amazing! came here at 8:30 on a wednesday night for my birthday dinner in vegas. i wish i remembered our serves name but he was excellent. super informative on the menu. i ordered a dirty martini and my friend their cucumber cocktail. my martini was perfect but my friends cucumber cocktail was delicious!! due to going out after dinner that night i didn't want to stuff myself so i ordered only the yamato roll and an order of salmon sashimi. i was between the <mark>El Topo</mark> roll and the yamato, my server suggested the yamato even though their <mark>El Topo</mark> is a trademarked roll that has a great following. the yamato roll consists of tuna, <mark>Foie Gras</mark>, <mark><mark>Osetra Caviar Imperial 20g</mark> 20g</mark> gold leaf...it was delicious. best sushi roll i've ever had and further more one of the best things i've had to eat. my friend had another roll i can't recall the name of (consisted of crab and shrimp) but she loved hers as well..and that is coming from someone who's only had a veggie sushi roll one other time and was very skeptical ordering it. for dessert they brought me out a mango ice cream cake pop looking dessert with a candle lit up, on the house!!! so nice of them to do that for my birthday. the manager came over to us and every table to check to see how everything was. without a doubt i will be back here for the great service, amazing food and perfect atmosphere of trendy but not stuffy. thanks for making my birthday dinner great sushisamba!!!", 
            "me and my wife came here for lunch and loved it. \nwe ordered green tea and was very good quality. \ni was reading other reviews and everyone mentioned the <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> skewers and <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark>. it was pretty good. <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> was very yummy but i would prefer to have less sauce. the yellow tail tacos were also very good and fresh. my favourite was the <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark>. just the right mix of sauce batter and shrimp. we ordered the <mark>El Topo</mark> sushi to top things off and it was not bad but wish i had more room to try other stuff. will definitely recommend and will come back for sure.",

            "talk about a hidden gem. this place is nestled deep within the palazzo shops, but don't let that stop you from going as it is definitely worth the trek. on our recent visit here, we had a variety of sushi and grilled items and everything was excellent. some highlights: \n\nshishito - nicely charred, spicy, drizzled with oil and sea salt. very good. best shishito i've had.\n<mark>Organic Chicken</mark> - a little heavy with the sauce but still a good eat.\n<mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> - yum! both the chicken and the <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> were served on a bed of <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark>, which was very tasty. \n<mark>Rainbow Dragon</mark> roll - nicely crafted roll of fresh eel and avocado with just the right amount of sauce.\nkanpachi - delicious with lots of wasabi.\n\nfor drinks i had the caipirinha--a brazilian concoction--which was not only excellent but also a steal at only $10.\n\ni would deduct a star as our staff failed to mentioned certain items were out of stock after we had ordered them, but i realize this place is very new and they're still getting their act together. i'll definitely come back again.\n\n(my rating scale:\n5-outstanding, sets the standard for others. 4-very good, would bring friends/family here. 3-decent but wouldn't recommend to others. 2-disappointing. 1-a waste of everyones' time.)", 
            "i had doubt on this place. \n\nhow would brazilian food work well with japanese food? i only love authentic japanese food. i sure can have the typical combination, but i only see that as american japanese food. \n\nsometimes i feel like a restaurant that does fusion because it does not have a firm grip to do the real deal. \n\nbut this place changed my mind. it earned my respect. i ordered some grill items, some sushi rolls, and some nigiri. the nigiri was done properly. the portion of rice and fish was proper. i enjoyed two of the sushi rolls: yamato (tuna, <mark>Foie Gras</mark>, <mark><mark>Osetra Caviar Imperial 20g</mark> 20g</mark>, gold leaf) and <mark>Rainbow Dragon</mark> (freshwater eel, red bell pepper, cucumber, mango, avocado). i know, the <mark>Rainbow Dragon</mark> roll sounds like a stable nowadays (like chicken teriyaki). but i was surprised by the use of mango in the roll. the mango gave that interesting bite to it. the yamato roll was a surprise - i didn't expect <mark>Foie Gras</mark> would go so well with ahi tuna. but the gold leave was pointless (in my opinion) other than giving a bling bling (and charge extra expensive) for the roll. \n\nthe seviches was just ok (i.e. within expectation). but the robata was good - we had fillet mignon and lamb. we also had japanese kobe beef (well, we were travelling at vegas - so we just splurged on our food instead of spending it at the outlet). it was good. but i think it's overpriced. if you haven't had japanese kobe beef before, you don't have to try it at this place unless you are ready to spend some money or to celebrate your win at the casino. \n\nthe decor has those typical hip restaurant vibe. the harajuku graffiti was a bit awkward to me but i guess most customers will think that's cool. but i wasn't impressed by the video that was played by the restaurant when i was there. we were there for an early dinner (to catch a show at the hotel). so we were there around 5:45. and the restaurant was playing some party video was not that respectful in my opinion. pretty much you only see a brunch of people partying and dancing and showing their skins. (only a few step away from girls gone wild japanese party version). there were some close up of girls' legs and cleavage that kinda bothered me. \n\nluckily, some customers requested to watch something else. it was the time about the bailout plan and eventually the large screen was showing news. \n\nso the party video took that star away. \n\nalthough it's kinda dark in the restaurant, i saw a couple with two young kids having dinner as well. it's not necessary kids friendly but kids are welcome. \n\nbut the food at this place was surprisingly good. so, it's worth to give a try. and if you are catching a show, the restaurant will make sure you will be able to make it. :)",

            "yum!\n\ncame here for dinner whilst on vacation. cute place with a bar area and then more extensive seating for the restaurant area. our party of 3 ordered an appetizer of kobe beef (super super pricey! our waitress had to inform us that the actual price was even more expensive than what was listed on the menu) and i wanted yellowtail so we got the hamachi sashimi tiradito. the kobe was really tender and delicious; we got to cook it on a hot rock ourselves. it came with an assortment of sauces and oils and salts, but my preference was just to dip it in the sesame oil before cooking it and then getting a few grains of the black rock salt to stick to the edge of the meat before eating it. the tiradito was yummy too. it came with a tangy spicy, ginger-y sauce (that was also given to us with the kobe) and was topped with little red jalepeno slices (and since i love spicy foods, that was awesome to me).\n\nfor main entr\\u00e9es, we ordered the chef special sushi platter and asked to make sure they gave us the 'yamato' as one of the rolls (which is really fancy with <mark>Foie Gras</mark> and tuna and <mark><mark>Osetra Caviar Imperial 20g</mark> 20g</mark> gold leaf). we also ordered the 'bobo brazil' which contains kobe beef and chimichurri (one of my favorite sauces) amongst other things, and the '<mark>Rainbow Dragon</mark>' which had a wasabi pea crust on it, which made the texture really interesting (in a good way).\n\nto go with our meal, we also ordered several different kinds of sake. we ended up having the manager (who is an avid sake enthusiast and has been to japan many times to find delicious sake for the restaurant) help us out with choosing the right sake to go with our dishes. we started off with an unfiltered, super fruity, sweet sake which i fell in love with. i'm not a big fan of sake usually, but this one was really good. the other ones we tried were all pretty good too (light and i could barely taste the alcohol) but they were all overshadowed by the first one we had.\n\nsince we had already racked up a pretty extensive bill with all the food that we ordered, we decided to splurge on a little dessert too. i ordered the 'carmen miranda' which is just seasonal fruits with a little cake and yuzu sorbet. the sorbet was tart and refreshing and a nice way to end the meal (like a palette cleanser and breath saver! haha). someone else ordered the warm chocolate banana cake. our server told us it was the most popular dessert but warned us that it was super rich and heavy. it came out in a huge flying saucer shaped dish with a tiny dip in the middle to hold the dessert. i didn't taste it but it definitely smelled and looked amazing and the guy who ordered it seemed to enjoy it.\n\noh! and the highlight of the night was when the dj started playing some fedde le grand tracks!! gawd. a meal encompasses not only the food, but the ambiance, and that was perfect for me. (the dj was set up in a really accessible location, so i'm sure you could go and request stuff if the music you're hearing isn't adding to your meal).",

            "what a way to celebrate my 21st birthday. after this experience i can only hope to have the opport<mark>Uni</mark> to come back year after year to celebrate just as perfectly.\n\nnot only was the food and drink world-class, the service and attention was deserving of 5 stars alone and both the servers and manager truly made this a special and memorable meal and experience.\n\nwe had 6:30 reservations but we arrived and were seated about 15 minutes early no questions asked and the night took off from there. \n\ni started the night with a brisa caliente cocktail: a conservatively spicy blend of tequila, ginger, fruit juices and chili in a rimmed glass with a shimchimi, a deliciously spicy japanese chili. although only a few days into the legal realm, i think i'll have a favorite drink for a long time coming.\n\nmy father and i split a number of dishes, including:\nspicy tempura rock shrimp: incredible array of flavors and textures. i've had similar dishes from local japanese fusion places and nobu and sushisamba's by far surpassed the competition. priced a little less with a more substantial portion, i could have been okay ordering a few of these.\n\nyellowtail and w<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> \"taquitos\": taquitos in the sense these two-a-piece small dishes were served in a mini crispy wonton-taco, the spicy aji panca sauce was drinkable by itself but added a level of sophistication that totally elevated the dish. i prefered the yellowtail over the w<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> mainly as the flavor of the fish was able to shine more than the beef. that said the beef was still really, really good.\n\n<mark>Broiled Peruvian Bay Scallop</mark>: served on the shell, these reminded me of a \"<mark>Scallop</mark> rockefeller\" of sorts, and the lime-butter crust was crispy and buttery. i'm glad they were <mark>Broiled Peruvian Bay Scallop</mark> versus their larger, more flavorful cousin since the crust was overpowering but as a single bite it was great.\n\nmiso chilean <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>: my favorite of the night, the two-skewer dish is completely melt-in-your-mouth with a perfect salty-sweet sauce. definitely the best non-<mark><mark>Osetra Caviar Imperial 20g</mark> 20g</mark> i've ever had. may be a little pricey but the flavor is just really, really good. this came with the <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark> which is now my all-time favorite vegetable...large kernels with a crazy good flavor.\n\n<mark>Sao Paulo</mark> samba roll: we were tempted by the gluttony of this everything-but-the-kitchen-sink roll and it was pretty awesome. it was a little much in the sense it's hard to differentiate everything inside, but the sauce on the side added an indescribable flavor that made it special. the roll comes with scallop, masago, red onion, tuna, salmon, shrimp, yellowtail, avocado, truffle, hacho miso soy, chive oil. wow.\n\n\"chef's inspiration\" sashimi platter: i'm a sucker for really good fish. that means i can be pretty picky, too. the platter came with 9 pieces, 3 each of sake salmon, akami tuna and yellowtail tuna. salmon included, the fish were so fatty (in the good way) and melt-on-the-toungue my father and i both were just blown away by the quality of raw fish from a restaurant which fuses japanese, brazilian and peruvian alike. \n\nraspberry sorbet w/ green tea coating: not sure what we were getting ourselves into with this, but the sweet white chocolate (?) and green tea ganache/candy-like coating paired with the super smooth and perfectly-sweet sorbet was the perfect end...and i don't generally choose fruit desserts.\n\n--\nall in all, i really cannot find any flaw in this place. i could only guess fewer-star ratings are attributed to a bad day or something because sushisamba has easily entered its way into my top 5 restaurants of all time...not an easy task. again i experienced wonderfully attentive service, great food, amazing cocktails and ended the night full and happy. not much more i could have asked for. thanks for an awesome birthday!", 
            "this is my favorite restaurant in vegas! the space itself is dark / trendy and has crazy beams and accents running across the ceilings and walls. we started off with the yellowtail taquitos. they were absolutely delicious! i still dream of how fresh the fish was and how it was so well balanced by the crispiness of the taco. unfor<mark>Tuna</mark>, the portions were so small! at $6 per taquito, i was expecting something more filling. \n\ni had the <mark>Sao Paulo</mark> roll as my entree. this is basically a rainbow roll that you'd get at any other sushi restaurant. i was impressed by the quality of the fish and the sauces on the side. at $24, however, the price seemed a bit steep for a standard roll. \n\nif you're looking for quality japanese fusion food here, don't hesitate to stop by sushisamba! you won't be disappointed, but you may have to shell out a bit more cash than expected. would love to do the custom tasting menu, but maybe another time."

            "on the saturday of my bachelorette party, my girlfriends treated me to dinner at sushi samba.  it was a fabulous, memorable meal, where we ate well and celebrated in style.\n\nwe were staying at the palazzo, and sushi samba was the perfect venue for the occasion.  it was convenient to get to in heels, and the atmosphere was festive, edging on clubby without being obnoxious.  we had a big comfortable table, and service was excellent.  i wish we'd gotten the name of our waiter - he did a great job attending to our every need, and he guided us through the whole dining experience with expertise.  (for management - he was a tall guy who served a party of nine on 6/29.  you know, your only bachelorette party of the month?)\n\nwe ordered cocktails, which were pretty good.  i had a blame it on rio, a caipirinha variation with cacha\\u00e7a, agave syrup, fresh lime juice, cucumber, and jalape\\u00f1o.  it was both cool and spicy, and it went down really easy.  the classic caipirinha was also great, with just the cacha\\u00e7a, lime, and sugar.  i also tried some of the chu-cumber, a shochu drink with hendricks gin, elderflower liqueur, and muddled cucumber - very refreshing.  at some point, we got a complimentary cocktail tree, a beautiful iron tree bearing shot-sized wine glasses on every branch.  they held some frothy, sweet version of a screwdriver that was great for the occasion.\n\ndinner was delicious.  we had the option of ordering a la carte or omakase, and we decided to keep things simple.  we specified a price point and listed dietary restrictions, and the food just started coming.  it was all served family style, and everything was well portioned for our big group.  we left full but not overstuffed - a plus, since it had taken a team to stuff me into my white dress for the night.  the cuisine was fun, a creative, unforced fusion of japanese and peruvian styles.\n\nfirst, we had a trio of vegetable otsumami, all served together in a lovely green array.  there was the staple edamame with sea salt and lime, and <mark>Green Bean Tempura</mark> served with a rich black truffle aioli.  my favorite of the three, though, was the handful of shishito peppers.  these were grilled blistering black, polished with sea salt and lemon.  they were pretty irresistible.  next we got a tray of japanese a5 <mark>Seared W<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> Beef</mark> gyoza.  these were great, thin-skinned and stuffed with luscious hunks of beef rather than the usual mince.  they came with kabocha pumpkin pur\\u00e9e, a sweet soy drizzle, and a su-shoyu dipping sauce.  the best thing i ate all night, though, was a crispy taquito overflowing with yelllowtail, avocado, and roasted corn miso.  the shell was thin and crunchy, and the fresh, tender fish was just right with that avocado, miso, and some thinly sliced vegetables.  the taquitos were served with spicy aji panca sauce and fresh lime - that piquant, frothy sauce was just the icing on a beautiful fusion taco cake.\n\nafter the smaller plates were done, we moved on to big platters of sushi and sashimi.  i do not remember everything we got, as there were at least six or seven rolls and even more kinds of sashimi.  the rolls were great, a nice mix of california standards - you know, the mix and match of eel, yellowtail, tuna, etc. with avocado, cucumber, and dots of mayo - and more samba-specific stuff, with the stray <mark><mark>Alaskan King Crab</mark> Leg</mark> and lobster claw.  i particularly liked the <mark>Samba Strip</mark>, with <mark>Half Maine Lobster</mark> tempura, mango, tomato, chive, soy paper, and a coating of crispy rice.  it was unusual and flavorful, served with a peanut curry.  the rest of the platter came with a sweet thick soy sauce and a bit of mayo.  the sashimi was more traditional, served on a bed of ice.  it was hard to share, as there was only one of each kind, but the slivers i had were great.\n\nthe most filling part of the meal was the churrasco course.  we got two hefty platters of the <mark>Rio Grande</mark> with three meats, grilled hanger steak, ribeye, and chorizo.  these were great, juicy and tender and full of that hearty grilled meat flavor.  they came with a trio of dipping sauces - malagueta pepper oil, chimichurri, and a third that is infuriatingly absent from the menu.  we also had some sides of rice, beans, collard greens, and a medley of <mark>Roasted Seasonal Vegetables</mark> - giant corn kernels, toothsome brussels sprouts, carrots, celery, pearl onions, and more.  we also got miso-marinated chilean <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> a la carte, with roasted organic vegetables and oshinko.  this was a winner - the fish was moist, flakey, and shot through with miso flavor.\n\nwe were full by dessert, but loved the complimentary chocolate mousse, served with a sparkler and a congratulatory message.  the lush mousse came topped with crunchy chocolate pearls, whipped cream, and a little bit of candle-stuck banana.  we each got a sweet bite to end our wonderful dinner.\n\nin conclusion, my friends are the best - thank you girls for this weekend, and for this fun, delicious meal.  sushi samba was an a+ choice, worthy of a night i won't soon forget.", 
            "\"professor in the mist\"\n\npretty brown legs moved her quickly about the room, her tight black skirt barely hiding what lay beneath. eyewear gave her a professorial look, high heels a come hither look. yet it was the direct and patient manner in which she explained the menu items to my father that sealed her as the total package for me. i wish i remembered this fine creature's name but, alas, i was much too smitten to remember such a detail.\n\ndad ordered his usual scotch and mom and i opted for plain water. as we looked over the fare--a japanese/south american type blend--i kept stealing looks at the professor. she caught me a few times but neither of us cared. both of us smiled, in fact. it was an old game played by many throughout time, usually with far more success than ever attained by yours truly. that aside, the dining room was darkly lit, with a sushi bar in back and bar in front. a raucous group of tuxedo wearing party boys were slamming shots on the stools but eventually simmered down. perhaps one of the uber hawt barmaids had mentioned their over exuberance and they'd relented.\n\nanyway, after smooth as silk tutoring from the professor my dad finally settled on <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>(miso) and <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark> with a side of <mark>Roasted Seasonal Vegetables</mark>. mom went with a single samba roll which contained <mark>Half Maine Lobster</mark>, mango, tomato, chive, crispy rice, soy paper and peanut curry. and as for me, i wasn't in the mood for seafood so i asked for chicken teriyaki(samba style) with <mark>Purple Potato Mash</mark> potatoes. \n\nthe verdict?\n\nperhaps everything was fine. i never really know when with my parents. their company is somewhat like being immersed in fine mist after a few drinks. you can sort of see and understand what's going on, but not very clearly, which means you occasionally misread what's actually occurring. to wit: dad liked his fish(but he picked the restaurant so he would have liked whatever slop they put in front of him). mom said her lobster roll was good(but she never says negative things until years after the fact. kind of like her own statute of limitations if you will). and me? i always kind of defer to their mindset when in their company so i think my chicken and potatoes were good, although for something touted on the menu as a large plate i wish there had been more bird and buds.\n\neventually the professor laid our check on the table, and dad swiped it up before i could, although i must confess it was a lame and slow attempt on the part of my right hand. he gave his usual 15% tip and we departed sushisamba--which by the way is located off the shopping section of the palazzo hotel/casino. \n\ni guess we might have had a nice time there(i can't really be sure) but this much i do know: mist or no mist, the professor in high heels forever has my heart in her grasp...."

            "alright, now were getting to the good stuff. \n\nand by \"good\" i mean un-fucking-believable. yea, i said it. unreal. never have i wanted to pick up and move to vegas so much in all of my life, but i'm thinking about it after the dinner i had at sushisamba's new ultra lounge, sugarcane. this is an incredible statement for me because for one, i can only take vegas in small doses, and two, i despise the heat. so having said that you can believe me when i say that i love absolutely everything about sushisamba, the brazilian/peruvian/japanese fusion restaurant at the palazzo. \n\nwhere do i begin?\n\noh yes, holy mary mother of god, i've died and gone to heaven...\n\na friend of mine is the publicist for this new restaurant, as well as the brand spanking new, sugarcane. she hooked up a dinner reservation for me and some friends so that we could celebrate my good friend's birthday in style. upon our (late) arrival we were greeted warmly by the wait staff, as they explained to us that our party would be the very first members of the public to sit down to dinner in their brand new ultra lounge. as we walked through the dimly lit hallway, past the dj booth and dance floor, and into the dining area portion of sugarcane we were immediately taken back by the overall design concept of the space. i\"m gonna do my best to do it justice but i would highly recommend a trip here to experience for yourself because it is just too complex for words...\n\nthe walls are covered with graffiti-style murals of samurais and japanese script, the dance floor has a canvas like screen that wraps around the circular pods that make up the women's bathrooms (see pics) where they project abstract imagery to coincide with the music playing. the dj that night was claudio who i wanted to put in my pocket and take home because the music was just that dope. there are multi-colored glass cylinders that hang from the ceiling and beams of light (see pics) that separate the dance floor from the dining area that change from red to orange to white that create a truly magnificent effect. \n\nthe food and service is on a level that is even harder to explain - it was incredible. our waiter anthony took such good care of us we felt as though we were old friends by the time we left. of course, we were the first to be seated and the last to leave, so i guess if you spend enough time with your waiter (four hours) you begin to feel like family. our sake sommelier was a hilariously funny girl (i forgot her name) and very helpful and knowledgeable when describing our sake selections. we ended up choosing a bottle with gold leaf cherry blossoms there were supposedly good luck if you found them floating in your drink. \n\nour table decided to order the signature sushisamba 7-course omakase ($70 per person) as our dinner selection. anthony asked us if we had any food allergies or other special requests before going back to the kitchen to get our party started. our first course was a selection of appetizers (see pics) which included the kobe beef carpaccio with <mark>Mixed <mark>Wild Mushrooms</mark></mark>, seared ahi tuna on a tiny bed of spinach, and (my favorite) tiny ceviche fish tacos with a chili foam sauce that was amazing! next up was the best snow crab i have ever tasted, <mark>Filet Mignon</mark>, duck, chilan <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> (unreal), grilled tomatoes, fish jowel (i forget what kind) and the most beautiful sashimi plate i've ever seen/tasted. just when we thought we couldn't eat any more came the sushi course. a stand out roll was the kobe beef wrapped roll with (from what i can remember) a <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark>, cucumber and avocado center. as we sat back in our booth contemplating exactly how we were planning on walking out of there, anthony presented the birthday girl with an incredible chocolate fondue plate (see pics) complete with japanese-style sesame rice krispies, japanese cake, homemade marshmallows, and a selection of fruit. there were also mini fruit tacos with both mango and banana, with a chocolate mousse and caram<mark>El Topo</mark>. \n\ndo you see what i'm talking about?????\n\nhere's the rundown....\n\nparty <mark><mark>Assortment of Four</mark></mark>:\nfirst round of cocktails (on the house)\nseveral cocktails to follow\nbottle of premium sake\n7- course omakase dinner for four ($70 each)\nafter dinner cocktails\ndivine dessert platter\n\ntotal bill: approx $600\n\nnot bad i'd say. not bad at all. \n\nall in all, i plan to go back to visit several times over. anyone who stumbles upon this place should consider themselves lucky to be in the presence of such foodie excellence. this dinner made our entire trip, and made for a very, very happy birthday girl. \n\nsushisamba: the wait staff, the owner, the managers, the dj. you rock my rock-n-roll world.",

            "this place is sooo good. they have a really nice atmosphere. my friend placed reservation here for my birthday. we got there perfect timing. the waitress and manager are so friendly. service is really good here. now the food, just great. we got the appetizer with salted bean, tempera bean, and grilled jalapeno. the beans taste good. the jalapeno wasn't spicy, but had a very sourish/\"pickle\" taste. it's different. we ordered a samba roll. that was really good. crunchy, tasteful, and delicious. we ordered the tiger shrimp and <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>. both came with <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark>. it was my first time having <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark>. it is good. it's chewy and reminds me of \"sticky\" corn but larger size. the <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> was very good. the meat was soft and sweet and melts in your mouth. it had a teriyaki flavor i thought. the <mark>Shrimp</mark> was very good too. both tasted very fresh, especially the shrimp. it smells like the ocean. we also ordered fried calamari. the calamari has a tangy sauce poured on top with mixture vegetable including good tomatoes and <mark>Sweet Plantain</mark>. they brought out warm banana chocolate cake for me. the dessert is delicious. ice cream and a crunchy chocolate piece on top of warm chocolate cake in syrup with couple strip of fried banana. just delicious. all the food were brought out in a very good presentation. the dishes are pricey. but if you want to eat fresh and good quality food, you should come to this place.", 
            "sushi samba gets 5 big red stars in my book!\n\ndecor - i love the vibrant colors and pictures they had all over the walls. it reminded me of anime. \n\nservice - excellent! our waiter was very helpful and made many great suggestions. the food came quick as well even when the restaurant was full.\n\nfood - great presentation and absolutely flavorful! nom nom nom! i didn't want to get full so i could eat some more!\n\nordered:\n<mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> yakitori - this was our first dish to arrive and it definitely set the bar. the fish just melted off. it was cooked well and seasoned perfectly. the <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark> that came with it was good as well. very robust and large kernels. \n\nyellowtail ceviche - amazing! the lime juice and other flavors blended so well together. this was my favorite dish along with the <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> yakitori. \n\ntuna ceviche - the tuna was fresh tasting but wasn't as great as the yellowtail ceviche. maybe i got spoiled but i thought the <mark>Cherry Tomatoes</mark> and almonds over powered the fish, which too me isn't a good thing because i love raw fish. \n\nkanpachi sashimi - nice sliced of fresh kanpachi and jalepeno. wonderful dish. \n\n<mark>Neo Tokyo</mark> roll - it was good but not great. nothing much more to say about it. \n\n<mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark> - very crisp and fresh. lightly powdered shrimp. didn't have too much tempura and was not soggy like other places. \n\nsignature fruit cocktails - strong but also fruity (meaning i could tast the fresh fruit flavors). a good strong drink doesn't need to taste bad. \n\ni wold definitely go again and i am recommending sushi samba to all my friends and whoever else is planning on going to vegas. =d", 
            "one of my favorite sushi experiences everrrr.  i've been here three times on three different vegas visits and it's always delicious.\n\non the last visit, we opted for a tasting menu for a party of 7.  the waiter was selling it pretty hard and we finally gave in.  pretty glad we did too.  we asked for a lower end menu costing $50-55/head and the kitchen did a superb job.  we were able to taste way more than we would have ever imagined if we were to order a la carte.\n\nedamame\n<mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark> - (must get)\nyellowtail seviche taquitos - (yum!)\nyellowtail w/ jalapeno and lemongrass taradito (this is the best one)\nkanpachi w/ yuzu sea salt and black truffle oil taradito \ntuna w/ granny smith serrano and lime taradito\nsalmon w/ orange and miso taradito\n<mark>Filet Mignon</mark> robato w/ 4 kinds of sauteed mushrooms (yuuum)\nchilean <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> w/ miso sauce anticucho w/ <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark> (giant corn-delicious fish)\n<mark>Neo Tokyo</mark> roll\ngreen envy roll\n<mark>El Topo</mark> roll\npacific roll\n<mark>Rainbow Dragon</mark> roll\n\ndrinks  - overall they have pretty good drinks, and if you are clever enough to score some 2 for 1 coupons, it's worth it!  i like the samba juice and the lemon samurai. :)", 
            "i've been jaded by the whole fusion cuisine fare as there's so many that have done it terribly wrong.\n\nthis isn't the case at sushi samba.\n\nmy wife and i decided we take a chance and boy we were impressed.  i let our waitress know that we'd just like to try \"whatevers good\" and to please do not hold back...\n\nwe were entertained with 4 different sashimi dishes, tuna with a granny smith green apple puree, kampachi in truffle oil, squeeze of lime & some sea salt, salmon in mandarin orange reduction & kampachi in some sort of chile vinegrette... all awesome.\n\nnext we were served with some items from the robata, although the end pieces of the <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> did come off a bit dry, the prep, grilled green onion and center of the piece made up for it... i would of liked it not so seared but still great flavors.\n\nthis was also my first time having a ceviche with passion fruit sauce, let alone a lobster ceviche.. it was absolutely delicious. the sauce <mark>Shrimp and Vegetables</mark> were super colorful but all the flavors complimented each other nicely. a tiny bit of sourness from the passion fruit to substitute the <mark><mark>Osetra Caviar Imperial 20g</mark> 20g</mark>, and some truffle oil made it taste super buttery.. super delicious.\n\nthere were a couple other dishes that weren't as memorable, but were still very delicious.  eitherway, it didnt break our bank and i enjoyed our \"early dinner\".\n\nservice was great. pretty standard for all the restaurants there (we went to the las vegas, nv location in the palazzo)", 
            "this place was really built by a couple of my friends that couldn't stop talking about it.  i thought it was ok and overpriced, even for vegas standards. there were some great items--<mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> anticuchos and <mark>Berkshire Pork Belly</mark> ramen were my favs of the evening.  the sushi was decent but nothing out of the ordinary for the price.  the mini tacos were good, but just that, mini.  the <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark> was a bust at our table--way too much mayo and 2/3 of the <mark>Seaweed Salad</mark> tasted like nothing.  it prob would have fared better if my expectations weren't so high.", 
            "went back last week....the seviches and robatas were too good to pass up while i was in town.  \n\nwe ordered the <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark>, <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> miso, and tuna seviche.  everything was great.  the place was crowded, the crowd was hip and i was in culinary heaven.  \n\nif you like seafood fusion, when in vegas go to sushisamba.", 
            "i've never seen a kids menu available at a japanese or asian fusion restaurant. the little boy dining near us was given one of those training chopsticks that are screwed together and all you have to do is pinch...or maybe it was his own...unsure. haha. \n\nthe ambiance was just lovely. while my fellow diner and i waited for our order, we gazed the room and talked about it for a good 10 minutes. \n\nthe server was very friendly-all smiles- and she described all the dishes we had questions about and gave us great recommendations. we ordered:\n\nseviches and tiraditos (4 assortments for $35, good deal)\n      -<mark><mark>Jumbo Shrimp</mark></mark> =very fruity, didnt mix with the salty items, but good\n      -kanpachi = a very anomalous taste, you'd either hate or love it\n      - yellowtail tiradito = yellowtail is alwayys yumm\n      - yellowtail seviche = recommended along with ^\n\nwe ordered three samba rolls\n1) <mark>Samba Strip</mark> roll (<mark>Half Maine Lobster</mark>) = good amount of lobster and was yummy.\n2) bobo brazil (seared kobe beef) = was pretty good\n3) pacific (crab) = mediocre\n\nthis place is a little pricey, but you can't get these rolls elsewhere can you? idk, you try and tell me.", 
            "talk about an amazing dinner!!  i was taken to sushisamba by my gf's for my bachelorette weekend in vegas and sushisamba lived up to all of the rave reviews.  our table was perfectly located near the front so we could 'see and be seen'  the atmosphere of the bar and restaurant was very lively (labor day wknd saturday night) but we felt like they gave us very personalized attention every step of the way. \n\nour waiter , matt, was a rockstar!  he dealt with all of the crazy $h!t we kept saying and doing to him with total grace.  also, he let us mention our pricepoint per person as well as any culinary likes/dislikes/restrictions and we let him create a tasting menu for us.  here's what we got for $40/person (that's right...40.  crazy)\nyellowtail ceviche taquitos- very tasty\ntuna sashimi\nyellowtail sashimi\n<mark><mark>Alaskan King Crab</mark> Leg</mark>- always a hit\n<mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> roll + <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark> roll + tuna/avocado roll\nmeat sampler platter w/ hanger steak + grilled pork\nsides of collard greens and <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark>\nmiso glazed <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> skewers- amazing\n\nand did i mention he also hooked us up with several rounds of amazing shots??  he even made sure they had non-alcoholic shots made for the girl in our group who couldn't drink...very accomidating. \n\ni would definately go back there for the food and service.  a wonderful place to dine in a city full of great restaurants.", 
            "i love sushi... this place is the best sushi i have ever had...but soo expensive.\n\nwe ordered 3 oysters, 1 tiger <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark>, 3 sushi rolls and 1 alcoholic beverage= $130\n\nthe oysters we very fresh.\nthe 3 sushi rolls, had very good taste and texture. best sushi ive had, they all had different taste to them, not like other sushi rolls where they taste similar too eachother.\n\ni would go back, just for their sushi rolls, bomb ...", 
            "wow! i'll start off with that. this place was very good and the dining experience here was great.  a buddy and i sat at the sushi bar, the lady brought us over the menu, we browse it, deciding what to get and really couldn't decide.  the server stops by and explains some items and then also mentions we have the chef's choice (omakase) and we hesitate for a minute and sure, we'll take two.\n\nthe first course was string beans tempura, boring right?  no, the truffle aioli sauce that came with this was amazing.  i can't even explain the taste, it was really good.  you can drink it with a straw.  \n\nthe second course pork gyoza, sitting on a squash puree of some sort, i want to say butternut squash or something similar.  these were ok, nothing special.  the <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark> was delicious, nice spicy mayo sauce on top.  and the last component was a yellowtail taquito.  i liked these and it was served with a spicy sriracha sauce of some sort.\n\nthird course was meat heaven.  grilled pork tenderloin, hanger steak, and ribeye.  woo-wee!  i have to say though, some of the ribeye was a little charred, particularly the end pieces, but the middle was done right, medium-rare.  the hanger steak was good, tender and chunks of fat, good stuff.  the pork loin was awesome.  this dish is served with three sauces, two types of chimichurri and some peruvian pepper puree sauce that was unreal!  the pork fit so perfectly with this sauce, so recommended for anyone.  the chimichurri was so-so, not so great, but still good.\n\nthe last course consisted of rolls.  they have a special spicy yellowtail tuna roll with tempura flakes, but i thought this was ok, i've had better.  then a simple salmon and avocado and eel and avocado.  i've had the eel/avocado mixture many times, but i must say this is the best i've had.  the typical black sauce that's topped on was really good.  it had a sweet taste to it and all the flavors meshed oh so well.  good stuff.\n\nmy companion was done as we had so much food.  i decided to take a dive and get some dessert.  it was a chocolate, white chocolate pudding/custard type consistency and some crushed chocolate granola on the bottom.  it was ok, not that good.\n\noverall, great spot and recommended.  the chef's choice isn't as steep as all vs nobu and morimoto's (where i've had both).  you get the \"fusion-ness\" from the peruvian and brazilian influence.  luckily there's a few on the east coast in nyc, so i don't have to travel as far.", 
            "i have been craving this place ever since i left vegas. seriously. so good. \n\nmy fave items were:\n-coconut <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark>. each shrimp was perfect, crisp, delicious... topped with a bit of pureed truffle. mmmm\n-miso <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> satay... so tender, buttery, delicious.\n\nthe place was a bit over priced but those two items made my night. every single item we got was delicious.", 
            "amazing. the <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> with miso and raw <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark> were quite delectable. the only thing i kinda found sketchy about this place were the images on the projectors and tv.. great place overall though.", 
            "this restaurant is a chain and was pretty good.\n\nbeing a girls weekend away from home, we started off with their cocktail tree which is $70, but totally worth it! then we ordered otsumami which is an assortment of edamame, <mark>Green Bean Tempura</mark>, and shishito which was really good. their aioli sauce had a hint of truffles and a strong garlic taste but wasn't too over powering and made it really good with the <mark>Green Bean Tempura</mark>.\n\nafter that we had the <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark> that had bibb lettuce, tobanjan alioli, black truffle vinaigrette and in my opinion was only average. for my entree i had the miso-marinated chilean <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> and that was really, really good. very moist, tender, juicy and not fishy at all. it's everything you could wish your fish to be. the portion was a little small, but it was oh, so good!! i also had the <mark>Samba Strip</mark> roll which had <mark>Half Maine Lobster</mark>, mango, tomato, chive, crispy rice, soy paper, peanut curry and i thought it was alright. but for the price and how much lobster they gave us, it was really worth it.  the last thing i had was their <mark>Neo Tokyo</mark> roll that had yellowfin tuna, tempura flake, aji panca, which is also really good. \n\nmy overall experience was only a 3 stars because they said they were really busy that night (but didn't look that way to me because there were at least 5 empty tables in front of us) and they sat us in a corner and our waiter was a complete douche and couldn't get our order right nor could he remember what we ordered and came back on several occasions to reconfirm what we ordered. the manager there was also dumb and tried to help out only to make things worse because he asked us what we wanted to drink and didn't even bring our drinks and completely forgot about us. \n\nin the end, i'd come back cause the food was good, but hopefully i'll get better service next time.", 
            "we stopped here for a little lunch during happy hour on our trip.  the atmosphere of this place was awesome, i really liked the decor as well.  a very modern looking establishment.  \n\nthe happy hour menu is limited, but not bad at all.\n\nfor happy hour my wife and i got the <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> roll, a philly roll, <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark> roll, and chicken anticuchos.  i loved the chicken anticuchos.  super tasty, tender pieces of chicken with a nice teriyaki sauce.  the <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> roll was spicy.  spicier than what i'm used to.  i wasn't big on the <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark> mainly because if i'm eating sashimi or rolls, i like it cold. i just dont jive to well on warm sushi haha.  when it comes to warm fish, bbq salmon or halibut is my game.\n\nwe both ordered drinks, i ordered a mojito and the wife had a caiprianha.  the mojito i had wasn't working for me.  it was awesome they put fresh mint in it, but i hated getting foliage in my mouth.  also, it was rather strong.....i like a strong drink trust me, but something was different about the strength of this drink.  same on the caiprianha.  texas de brazil made an awesome caiprianha, so i dont know what was so different between the 2.\n\nwe did end up spending around 50 bucks at happy hour which was a shock.  we did enjoy it, and it is totally worth a stop.", 
            "me and a couple buds of mine decided it would be a good idea to fine dine before heading back home from our trip to vegas. i found this spot out by a buddy of mine who happens to be a local, so i took his word for it and made a reservation here. it took us quite a while to get seated... we probably had to wait 20-30 minutes or so to get seated even though we had a reservation (it was a saturday, not quite sure how it would be on any other days).\n\nanyway our waitor was nice.. very knowledgable and friendly. the food was so yum. the boyfriend and i ordered a whole bunch of things- <mark>Rainbow Dragon</mark> roll, tiger <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark>, <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>, uni sushi, and after reading the previous reviews here on yelp, we ordered the yellowtail taquitos... so glad we did because they were delicious! pretty pricey for a small taco but totally worth it. the minimum you could order is 2 and they're $6 each. definitely would come back here for the taquitos and the sake!", 
            "freaking yum. ceviches and tiraditos are a must!\n\nmy favorites seviches and tiraditos and were:\n\nsalmon, asparagus, red radish, pineapple and lime.\n\n<mark><mark>Jumbo Shrimp</mark></mark>, passion fruit, cucumber and cilantro.\n\ntuna, granny smith apple, serrano and lime.\n\nyellow-tail, jalapeno, and lemongrass.\n\nand definitely try the watermelon, guava and lime drink. best nonalcoholic drink i've had in forever.", 
            "japanese, peruvian, and brazilian fusion. i'd think that intrigue alone would be enough to bring anyone to sushi samba.\n\ni'll have to admit that i was nervous when our knowledgeable and friendly server began talking about the three different kitchens, the different ways to order...it all sounded way too complicated. (to be honest, i just wanted to fill my stomach so that i'd be able to drink later!) luckily, one of our friends is a sushi samba master, and he did all of the ordering for our table. \n\ni pretty much loved everything - if only for the novelty of it all - but a few stand-out dishes were:\n1) yellowtail ceviche taquito: they looked like little yellowtail and guacemole tacos. somehow it all worked...\n2) yellowtail tiradito: kinda like a ceviche? yellowtail, jalepeno, and lemongrass - i'm definitely a fan of sour and spicy.\n3) fresh oysters and <mark><mark>Jumbo Shrimp</mark></mark>: no explanations needed.\n4) <mark>El Topo</mark> roll: salmon, jalepeno, melted cheese, and crispy onions\n\ni also would recommend getting a side of <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark> (which went along with our churrasco plate) just to see how huge those kernels are! it's kind of ridiculous. anyway, not only was the food great, but the service was among the best - they even have a \"sake sommelier\", so to speak. the place itself is energetic, contemporary, and very, very vegas. i can't wait to go back!", 
            "it's like eating sushi at a night club. really good sushi.\n\nthe ambiance is very contemporary with tons of lamps hanging from the ceiling. lighting is minimal. \n\nhere's the breakdown of the food that i tried.\n\n<mark>Tuna Tataki</mark>: very good. super fresh. i can't say it was the best that i have had but very close to it.\n\n<mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark>: this was an absolute favorite at the table. you have to try this! it's like tempura popcorn shrimp covered in a spicy alioli. \n\n<mark>Rio Grande</mark> three meats: all the meats were good. the dipping sauces made them fantastic. i wouldn't get this again though. not really great for how much it is.\n\nbobo brazil roll: really good! kobe beef on top....yum!\n\npacific: this was ok. nothing special about it. \n\nservice was fantastic! there was always someone out refilling glasses of water, beer, and sake and clearing out plates. very friendly too.", 
            "a friend of mine was raving about ss which set my expectations a bit high since he was industry folk but my experience was ok, sadly.  the space was cool in a japanimation type of way.  the temperature was a bit warm for a casino and music a bit blaring for my taste.  but what it really comes down to is the food, right?  the food was ok but not bad.  the <mark>Berkshire Pork Belly</mark> was incredibly delicious but the <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark> with truffle was soggy and didn't have the bite and crispy goodness a tempura typically has.  i just expected a bit more out of this brand name and really didn't do it for me.  i probably wouldn't go back.  there are plenty of other restaurants in vegas that are worth betting on.", 
            "went there for happy hour on a wed night. it was pretty dead by the time we got there. didn't like the mojito...  even though it was$6 only. the <mark>Salt and Pepper Squid</mark> was good. veggie tempura decent, chicken skewer was good and <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark> roll was terrible. service was pretty good.  enjoy", 
            "my dad picked out this place to go to dinner when he was in town this weekend.  i had never been, and i love sushi, so i was totally ok with his choice.\n\nwe arrived and looked at the menu, but ended up not needing it as we settled on the option our server gave to us... tell her our likes and dislikes, and they'd make a custom menu for us to try a bunch of everything.\n\nwhat followed was a lot of food that we would have never ordered... and we were delighted at the items they brought us.  our favorite was the chilean <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>, which was so tasty.  it came with <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark>, which is like huge overgrown corn.  we also really enjoyed the yellowtail seviche taquitos and the <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark>, as well as a few of the numerous sushi rolls they had brought at the end.  and our meal also included giant <mark><mark>Alaskan King Crab</mark> Leg</mark>, some peruvian sashimi, and at least one or two dishes i'm failing to remember.\n\nthe music was a little loud and not to my dad's taste, but that's typical in vegas.  the meal was definitely a <mark>Uni</mark> experience, and we wouldn't have stumbled upon half the dishes without letting the chef do his thing.  i highly recommend you dine in this fashion if you visit sushi samba.", 
            "excellent food, but it comes at a price. my boyfriend and i came here for what was supposed to be a light lunch, but we spent over $80 and still left hungry! but it's vegas, and it certainly wasn't the most expensive restaurant we came across. the menu didn't have as many sushi options as we expected- just the basics and a small list of specialty rolls. but there was a good variety of other fusion dishes, which seems to be the restaurant's main focus.\n\nmy boyfriend started off with the sawagani, which is flash fried japanese river crabs. basically, they're small (~1 inch) fried crabs that you eat whole. there was no way i was touching those things! i had the <mark>Tuna Tataki</mark>, which was very fresh and came in a tasty sauce.  we shared the <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark>, which came in larger sized pieces, and the <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> roll. both tasted fine. \n\nfor drinks, my boyfriend tried one of their shochus (not soju), a japanese drink similar to sake but tastes like vodka. prices ranged from $10-15 a glass, and it was pretty potent for a lightweight like me.\n\nservice was great. our server was attentive and had no problem explaining the items on the menu. atmosphere-wise, the interior has a nice, modern decor, but the music is really loud, and the lighting is very dim. overall, we had a good dining experience, and i would recommend trying this place if you have some money to spend!", 
            "my opinion/side note - i dont think its their sushi that makes this a good place to eat. but its the dishes that are not other sushi restaurant menus that makes it worth the cost.\n\nthis place is really good, only if you order the right things, because ordering something bad can cost you a pretty penny. i have been here twice and the 2nd time was much better because we all knew what we liked. \n\nthe chilean <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> on the robata grill section was probably my favorite rendition of chilean <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>. our waiter said the robata grill costs $1000 a day to operate? something like that. but wow it was good. you have to order off of this part of the menu if you are a fan of grilled food.\nprobably the only time i felt like a winner in vegas all weekend, just playing, kinda, lol.\n\nthe yellowfin taquitos were so <mark>Uni</mark>, and the foam chili sauce that came with it was the perfect compliment.\n\n<mark>El Topo</mark> - good but not great. table loved it though.\n\n<mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark> with black truffle aoili - if i ever make my dream of opening up a restaurant come true - this will be the first item on the menu. wowwww. it made a shrimp convert out of 1 the people at our table. but really how can u not like shrimp?\n\n\n-p", 
            "i had the chance to go back this past weekend and got a completely  different experience the second time around at sushi samba. \n\nafter a fun filled weekend adventure in vegas, we decided to give ss another shot. it was my cousin's birthday, and we figured we would stop by for a farewell vegas-birthday dinner. we stayed at the venetian, which made ss a stone throw away. we couldn't have came at a better time, the environment was so much more personal than the time before. i highly recommend avoiding peak dining hours if possible. this will give you time to enjoy your meal while getting some extra attention from servers. since we arrived at around 4pm on a sunday, the timing was perfect. \n\nour party grabbed a couple dishes and shared them all. this was the perfect way to sample everything. we started our mission into japanese/peruvian/brazilian adventure with...\n\notsumami: a mix of three appetizers. edamame, fried green beans, and grilled shishito peppers. my absolute favorite was the shishito peppers. they were doused in sea salt and lemon, and one out of every couple were spicy. perfect mix to the subtle hues of the edamame. \n\nyellowtail seviche: little tiny tacos filled with a mixture of yellowtail, onions, avocado and a side of chile sauce. these little babies packed a flavorful punch!\n\nnext up was the smoked <mark><mark>Alaskan King Crab</mark> Leg</mark>: wood fired, served in the half shell, perfectly cut and smothered in a signature sauce. these were so delicious and just melted in my mouth like butter!\n\nround four, <mark>Broiled Peruvian Bay Scallop</mark>: served in the shell as well, perfectly cooked. you can tell that they know how to prepare their seafood because everything tasted so fresh. this was my cousin's favorite dish and her first time ever trying <mark>Scallop</mark>. \n\nthen came out the <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark>. we could hardly eat anymore, however we asked for the most flavorful, scrumptious items, and intended on finishing them! after that, the yellowtail sashimi. it had spicy blended orange sauce on it, that was the perfectly paired with the fish. my personal fave of the night. \n\nmake sure to order a signature cocktail while you are there. we had a couple (after all, what kind of birthday is complete without drinks?), and the one that really stood out was the chu-cumber. it was like you were drinking the most exquisite cup of tea mixed with the cool tones of cucumber, all while getting a little buzz on. \n\nmy taste buds are so happy that i gave sushi samba another shot. the best part was, management remembered that it was my cousin's birthday, and brought out a little slice of carrot cake with ice cream and sparklers crowning the top. it was definitely a birthday dinner that we will all remember.", 
            "chilean <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> skewers with miso - absolutely delicious!  the <mark><mark>Jumbo Shrimp</mark></mark> with passionfruit ceviche -- original and delightful.  my husband's favorite dish was the <mark>Tuna Tataki</mark> .  we came here because i had a taste for sushi and it was the highest ranked by yelpers.  when we arrived, the bar atmosphere caused us to question the yelp reviews but after eating we agree.  the sushi rolls aren't that great (we tried the <mark>Samba Strip</mark> and <mark>El Topo</mark>) but they weren't horrible.  the servers are familiar with the entire menu so if you don't have a specific taste for something, feel free to ask them for their suggestion. they'll have a ton.  also, their drinks are good but lean away from being sweet.  i had to have them muddle more sugar and mint to flavor up my drink a little more because it just tasted like rum with a little mint when they first brought it out.  this is a tapas place so you can easily order 4 plates per person which can get pricey.  but highly recommend for their chilean <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> skewers.  i haven't had <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> this good since g. garvin's restaurant in west los angeles closed a few years ago.  outstanding.", 
            "sushisamba...... where do we start????   ok, lets start with the first thing that was delivered... its my neverfail when i go for sushi....  <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> roll....   even if the tuna isnt the highest of quality somewhere, the <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> roll isnt half bad because of the spicy mayo.....   ok...   sushi samba version is hands down the absolute best <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> roll i have ever had..   woah, time to calm down about it....  the sushi roll literally melted in my mouth, the tuna was uber fresh, the spicy mayo was applied in moderation let his presence be known....   this thing was absolute perfection....  everything else we ordered was great, not to the perfection level of the <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> roll, but it was still great.  wayyyyy better than good.  had some yellowtail roll, oh yeah a $36 kobe beef sashimi roll with some deliciousness baked into it, <mark><mark>Jumbo Shrimp</mark></mark> - straight from the ocean fresh...   some japanese beer, some of this some of that, an hour later and $200 tab we emerged with smiles from ear to ear....   i had always heard good things about the place, but until i experienced it for myself, could never truly know how great it actually is.  i will be going back shortly, even if its only to order the <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> roll...   i would trust that everything they have there would be to the quality in which i encountered in my meal.... fear not yelpers... this place will treat you right....", 
            "omg, is it possible to be this good?  3 times there now and 3 times i have been equally impressed.  one thing that has been a constant on all 3 visits has been the great service i received.  our waiters always their menu's and made fantatsic recommendations.  this time i had the tempura greenbeans with a truffle oil dipping sauce (delicous!), berkshire pork gyoza and <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark> (at the recommend of our server)  everything was well prepared and efficiently served.  sushi samba is now a place that i can truly call home for great sushi.  as you can tell by my reviews, its safe to say that i am a fan.", 
            "i wasn't planning on going to sushisamba while in vegas, as we have a few in nyc and i never even bothered going to either of them. but we were wandering around the venetian/palazzo and we decided to go for it. what a pleasant suprise...everything was outstanding. there is nothing more fun than ordering a bunch of small plates and trying different things...which is why i love places like this and julian serrano...different cuisine...same concept. the aja sauce they give you for the lobster tacquitos is slam bang delicious, the seared kobe small plate was a-one, everything else was great also...<mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark>, <mark>Salt and Pepper Squid</mark>, oysters, foie/kobe roll with <mark><mark>Osetra Caviar Imperial 20g</mark> 20g</mark> gold leaf was actually the weakest dish...i got it just because of the novelty aspect really.", 
            "these 5 stars goes to the lady who was so damn good at her job by fulfilling every aspect of our dining experience that the food was more like a plus. i wish i got her name to credit her but we were a party of 8 girls staggering in late in high heels for our dear friend's bachelorette reserved dinner on a saturday night a week ago.\nwe got the run down quickly on doing their style of \"omakase\" after mentioning we had a show and had to finish by 9pm. we gave her free rein with a price per person between $30 to $40.\nnow, i was the only one who had been here before for the same concept so i was expecting the same good service and food. so i discreetly asked the lady server to make sure to add the miso <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> skewers. she happily replied, \"i gotchu girl!\" \nwe were then offered the extensive sake and wine menu, which we had to forgo. and one of the girls almost ordered the cucumber martini but didn't.  \nafter the time it took for a buzzed dude to walk over, show us his awesome swim trunks, (clearly forgetting to dress his bottoms to match his sharp shirt), wink and share a charming smile, and then leave...our appetizers were presented by a team of 3 servers.\n- otsumami: trio of edamame, tempura green beans with amazing truffle dip, grilled shishito pepper :)\n- pork gyozas (ok)\n- <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark> (wasn't as succulent or saucy but still good)\n\nour waters were always filled. thank you water guy!\n\nthen after enjoying our appz for about 20 mins, came out the yummiful skewers, 3 specialty rolls of sushi (could have asked for the <mark>El Topo</mark> roll but decided try the others) and an entree split by 2 plates to share. it was the teriyaki chicken with fried onions atop mashed purple potatoes. this is so yum because the chicken was juicy and flavorful!\n\nwe were having our fill and we were on schedule. then the lady server got us a surprise sake tree of their cucumber martini! also very refreshing and yum to end our meal.  we had to pack a bit of to-go and we were happy with the service. she lined our meal down the middle of our price range to about $36/person (plus tax+tip $45).\nso exceeded my last experience here!  i recommend the omakase style because the servers really do know the menu. trust!", 
            "my husband and i looked at an address wrong for a restaurant we were going to try.  long story short, we were at the wrong casino.  we decided to stay at palazzo.  we love the palazzo and have never had a bad experience here and figured we couldn't go wrong.  however, this is my least favorite dining expereince i've had to the venetian or palazzo.\n\nsushisamba was having their happy hour on friday 4-7.  we sat up at the bar and ordered off their happy hour menu.  we each decided to try the caipirinhas.  i'd equate this to a brazilian margarita.  i think the bartender said it has rum instead of tequila???  not positive though.  she hands the drinks to us and says something to the effect of \"this isn't my favorite drink, but it gets the job done\".  we didn't ask her if it was a good, bad or indifferent drink.  we just wanted to try something off their happy hour menu that we'd never tried before.  i thought it was a rather odd comment to make.  then when we tried it, we weren't crazy about it either.  if she was going to say something, she should've told us when we ordered.  regardless, the drink kind of grew on us.  didn't order a second and probably won't order the drink again, but it wasn't horrible.\n\nas far as food, we tried the chicken anticuchos, <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark> roll, salmon taquitos and yellowtail seviche.  chicken anticuchos were good....basically a chicken skewer with teriyaki.  <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark> roll was average.  salmon taquitos were kind of strange...if you do order these, make sure to put the spicy sauce on them.  without the sauce, they aren't very good.  last but not least, the dish i truly enjoyed was the yellowtail seviche.  the yellowtail was buttery and spicy all at the same time....very good.\n\nall said and done, our tab was just under $40 before tip.  not bad.  however, there was something about this place, i don't see myself ever coming back here.  other than the yellowtail, nothing was that good.  average to mediocre at best.", 
            "the kids meal is a great deal.  the adult menu is pricey and you will leave hungry unless you spend a lot of money.  we tried <mark>Purple Potato Mash</mark> (good), miso pork ramen $18 (for soup!), <mark>Berkshire Pork Belly</mark> (great if you savor the taste of fat), edamame and <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark>.  it was around 100 bucks - hubby left hungry", 
            "delicious drinks and food, and the bar tenders/servers rock! they have a happy hour that starts at 11pm, with the only catch being that you have to eat/drink at the bar. we preferred this as the music inside the restaurant was at night club volume. our order included <mark><mark>Jumbo Shrimp</mark></mark> seviche (amazing), the <mark>El Topo</mark> roll (it's so <mark>Uni</mark> they trademarked it), the <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark> roll, and shisito peppers. with our food and five drinks later (2 mojitos and 3 caipirinhas), our bill was $65. if you're staying at the palazzo or anywhere in vegas for that matter, it's definitely worth a visit.", 
            "i had an amazing dinner here for my bachelorette party! i've been to sushi samba in miami & was happy to be back. the vibe is very upbeat with a club feel & the food is a <mark>Uni</mark> fusion of south american & japanese...who would of thought?? our server was matt & not only was he attractive but he was kind enough to serve us a penis cake with sparkler candles...awesome! we heard about their \"secret\" prix fix menu here, so we decided to go with it. our server asked us a bunch of questions about our preferences & food allergies to gage what type of menu we would receive. it didn't matter because everthing they served us was absolutely great.  here is a run down of what we had: \n\n-<mark>Green Bean Tempura</mark> (light & crunchy) \n-shishita peppers (could eat a pound of these everyday) \n-pork gyoza (savory with a wonderful sweet potato puree underneath) \n-yellowtail sashimi (so fresh with a lovely sauce underneath) \n-lobster taco (good but doesn't knock my socks off like the others) \n-<mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark> (ummm...so good cant even begin to describe) \n-chilean <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> & chicken teriyaki skewers served with <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark> (<mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> was like butter, chicken was ok, couldn't stop eating the corn...think corn on steriods) \n-rolls (we got a variety, don't remember exactly but they were all very fresh) \nthat basically sums up our heavenly experience at sushi samba. our bill was pretty hefty after all was said & done. but it was totally worth it....i will be back! this time sans penis cake ;) thanks matt!!!", 
            "we were promised a \"dining experience\", and that's what we got!\n\na group of 6 of us came here, and we were instantly charmed by our server, michael. he recommended a custom \"dining experience\" for about $50-60 per person, based on our likes and dislikes. food just kept coming out and we had no idea what to expect, but michael really hit the nail on the head with everything he picked for us.\n\nsome of the highlights:\n\n- yellowtail tacos\n- yellowtail in lemongrass sauce\n- <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> (i don't eat <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>, but my friends were raving about it!). the <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark> that came with it was excellent \n- some kind of steak, cooked medium rare served with rice and beans\n- a sushi platter with <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark>, california, and <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark> rolls\n\nsushisamba is really great for groups, and since you can customize a meal based on your budget, it can be relatively affordable, too. and every dish was amazing! i definitely recommend it, and hope to try brunch at one of their nyc locations.", 
            "this restaurant caught my eye because it was something out of the ordinary from your typical sushi restaurant. the menu offered an intriguing variety but when i began reading the reviews i knew i had to try it. i would suggest anyone going there for the first time to try the dining experience because you may think you know what you want but the chef knows better! the server asks if there is anything you do not like or if you have any food allergies and then how much money per person you're looking to spend. there are options anywhere from $50 per person to $130 per person if kobe beef if something that interests you. as it was for a special occasion we opted for $80 per person and even though thats more than i have probably ever spent on a single meal there were no regrets.\n\ncourse #1 consisted of berkshire pork gyoza which is basically pork dumplings in a pumpkin puree and yellowtail ceviche taquitos, both of which were absolutely delicious and not necessarily something i would have ordered on my own.\n\ncourse #2 was yellowtail sashimi in a spicy peruvian sauce with a slice of red jalapeno on top and octopus sashimi in a japanese citrus sauce which again were both to die for!\n\ncourse #3 had an array of <mark>Filet Mignon</mark>, <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>, <mark>Alaskan King Crab</mark> and <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark>. all were moist and tender but the <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> absolutely melted in your mouth! <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark> was a yummy alternative to <mark><mark>Osetra Caviar Imperial 20g</mark> 20g</mark> as well.\n\nfinally, course #4 was the main sushi dinner. <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark> rolls were delicious, but the <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> with i believe tuna on top was absolutely amazing! there was also <mark>Half Maine Lobster</mark> and another roll which i believe had lobster in it as well and was probably the only thing of the entire dinner that i was not absolutely amazed with, but it was still good!\n\nanother great thing about this place is they tell you if there is anything throughout this meal you do not like they will take it back and bring you something else! as our server said, \"its like a money back guarantee!\"\n\nanyways this is definitely a place i would tell everyone who loves trying new things to try or even just the sushi lover. do it! it will not disappoint!\n\nonly part i would complain about is the fact that there is not one in california!!!",

            "oh. my. god. i want to eat here every day of my life, if only for the ishi yaki. my wallet is already throwing a fit about the thought of how quickly i would go broke, but akdsjhfakjldhf. words cannot describe how much i want to go back and eat all the things. well more specifically, all the ishi yaki.\n\nin reality though, sushisamba is unfor<mark>Tuna</mark> a sometimes food (unless you're a bajillionaire, in which case, dine on! i will live vicariously through you). it's just too expensive for me, as a student to afford. thank goodness someone else was picking up the check when i went.\n\nmy family and i had our christmas dinner here at like... 9pm (yea, we did christmas in vegas). it was by far, the fanciest christmas dinner i have ever had. \n\nwe were seated in the back room area since we had a relatively large party, but since it was so late, it was mostly empty there, which was simultaneously nice and eery. our waiter suggested we do the tasting menu, where he and the chef craft our meal for us, but since my mom had just been here with some colleagues the week before, we decided to just let her order for us, since she knew what was good. \n\n- <mark>Salt and Pepper Squid</mark>: the seasoning made this extra delicious-- a really good starter\n- crispy yellowtail taquitos: also yummy, though i may be biased because yellowtail is one of my favorite fish; very lime-y\n- <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark>: a twist on regular tempura, but absolutely delicious; if you don't like spicy mayo, maybe not your thing\n- ishi yaki: words cannot describe. <mark>Grade A5</mark>5 japanese waygu that you cook yourself on a hot japanese river stone? yes, please! you take a slice of meat, dip it in oil, and then put it on the hot stone to let it cook. there's a few different dipping sauces and three different types of salt that you can add to your meat. all of them are delicious, though i am partial to the black salt. there were some pears on the plate, so i was like what the heck, why not cook those on the stone too. still delicious. even thinking about this is making me crave it. the ishi yaki is really expensive, but if you're going to go for any of the japanese waygu options, go for this one because it is definitely the most <mark>Uni</mark>.\n- we ordered a bunch of sushi rolls, which were good, but not the most amazing ones i've ever had.\n- also, the lychee bubbletail is really good. the alcohol is not overpowering, it's not too sweet, and they put a real lychee (probably from a can) in it.\n\nrandom: i really like the music on their website... that probably sounds really weird, but it's true. love it.\n\ntl;dr: i know for a fact that the main reason why i love sushisamba as much as i do is because i was not paying. it was a crazy expensive meal, but it was delicious because we ordered some rather expensive (but good! oh so very good!) things. if you're not willing to splurge, you'll probably think i'm crazy for giving them a 5-star review, but if you are, be prepared to be amazed. just don't think about the check. and get the ishi taki. 5-stars for that alone.", 
            "wandered in here without a plan for a first time meet up.\n\nthough my eyes were not necessarily on the food, i noted a few things, sitting at a table vs. sitting at the sushi bar: the emphasis was on the fusion foods (sushi menu was backpage) and the drink menu was bigger than the food menu. i agree with bunny g. that no one bothered to explain anything about the menus.\n\nordered their house ice tea which is a mint tea arnold palmer, served with lemon & lime wedges.  very tasty & refreshing since i don't think i've ever had an arnie with mint tea.\n\nthe edamame was standard fare, served cool with crushed rock salt sprinkled on top.  i ordered 2 rolls, <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark> (6 pcs), and a <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> (8 pcs).  the <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark> was exactly that, no fuss, frills, standouts.  the <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark>, i think was just a tuna roll served with a squirt of sriracha.  good thing i wasn't there for the food!\n\nthe decor & service were exceptional and it looked like there was a special/private dining area in the back.  interesting decor that isn't particular of any single culture, or at least any that i know of.  there were these wooden chairs that looked to be carved out of giant coconuts but could really only seat an ommpa loompa.  another strange touch, that doesn't quite work to me: the food menus were not on the small side, but the cover was like leather, as in, not self supporting.  the only way to read the menu, that didn't feel awkward, was to lay it on the table.  for some reason, i didn't want a leather menu touching my little appetizer plate.  it seems unsanitary.\n\nbecause the prices were so high, i rate the food a 2-2.5 stars, but the decor & service a solid 4 stars.  so, 3.33 stars, it is!", 
            "i wanted to give this 4.5 stars, but i'll round down. came here with my sister for a convention in vegas, we walked around the venetian and pallazzo for a while until we finally decided on sushisamba.  first of all, the restaurant is beautiful. i really love the wall painings, interior design, and the bathroom design was really cool as well. service here was excellent, my water was always full, when i got up to use the restroom i placed my napkin on the table, when i came back it was neatly folded back for me. \n\nwe decided to get two appetizers. first the <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark>... really no point in ordering this. tempura taste the same everywhere, nothing special about theirs. we also tried the taquitos as suggested by the waitress. these were really just mini taco's. main lobster and yellowtail. both were nice and chilled taco's. good sauce on the side. not sure if i'd order them again, but they were decent.\n\nfor dinner my sister ordered their miso marinated chilean <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>. this was absolutely excellent. the fish was cooked perfectly, it was so soft and delicious. it's served with vegetables and those were pretty good too. possibly the post chilean <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> i've ever had. \n\nfor my dinner i decided to order two rolls, the <mark>Neo Tokyo</mark> and the bobo brazil. the <mark>Neo Tokyo</mark>, which is bigeye tuna and tempura flake was delicious. the little sauce on top was a nice spicy sauce. this roll was very delicious. as for the bobo brazil.... quite gross, too much avocado, wayyy too much in fact, in overpowered the entire roll. both regular avocado and some mushy avocado. in addition the red onion also gave it some very odd taste. this was one of the worst sushi rolls i have ever eaten.\n\nfor dessert we ordered the samba split for two. it was really good, and a decent sized portion. everything on the plate complemented each other and the banana brulee was fantastic.", 
            "my stars:  (5=epic \"best of\") (4=really tasty and want to go again and again) (3=good and will go back once in a while) (2=fair, might return for a visit if there was some glimmer of hope) (1=avoid at all costs)\n\ngo or no?  go.\n\ntease:   sushisamba is a japanese sushi and peruvian fusion place in the palazzo.\n\nwhy i went:   my wife and i wanted a late afternoon snack, and sushi sounded good.  we were staying at the palazzo, so we figured we'd give the place a try.\n\nwhen:  11/17/12\n\nfood:   between us, we got the <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark> roll (generic, but pretty much as good as you could get), ume shiso roll (very flavorful), urchin, spanish mackerel, and <mark>Alaskan King Crab</mark>.  everything was fresh and tasty.  the overall menu looked super interesting and something worthwhile to check out in full for a dinner or lunch.  we just ordered small things as nibbles.    \n\nservice:  very good.  \n\nhints/final thoughts:  sushisamba has enough interesting items on their menu to make it stand out.  additionally, they do just enough <mark><mark>Osetra Caviar Imperial 20g</mark> 20g</mark> to please some more hardcore sushi fans.  this is a fusion, so expect it in almost everything.  but the tastes are interesting and the food is fresh.", 
            "oh my goodness. i would have to say the dinner i had here was one of the best treats i've had this year! i am so for<mark>Tuna</mark> to have gotten this experience that i will never forget. it was so awesome! if coming here, i'd suggest making reservations because it is jam packed, but only because it is that good. the environment is bustling and vibrant. so. much. fun! \n\nwhen my friends showed up we got seated right away were introduced to the chef who told us he had many special dishes on their way. first off they presented us with a tower of drinks! all mini glasses of their specialty cocktails. so awesome! there were four of us and they brought us a total of 3 towers, so we each got to try 6 different flavors. loved it so much. the variety was just amazing. i'd have to say my top 3 favorites were the chu-cumber (cucumber flavored one), the lemon samurai, and pisco sour (i have visited peru before so i've had the opport<mark>Uni</mark> to try an authentic version of this before). so so great!\n\nall the meals brought out for us to share were fantastic! the <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark> was different a cool blend of flavors to add to our palette. the <mark><mark>Alaskan King Crab</mark> Leg</mark> were perfection! and my other favorite dishes were the mini tacos and the shelled <mark>Scallop</mark>. so amazing! other fantastic dishes i got to try were the <mark>Salt and Pepper Squid</mark>, <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark> (amazing), miso marinated <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>, <mark>Chicken Teriyaki-Samba Style</mark>... like i said. one. amazing. experience!!! i can't wait to come back again.", 
            "in las vegas as well as other big restaurant/entertainment towns, good food is expected but in las vegas it sometimes does not fully compare to chicago and ny.\n\nhowever, the one place i finally went to was sushi samba and what a great surprise.  i tend to avoid sushi in several places when traveling unless in hawaii and some parts of ca and japan.  sushi samba had some of the best dishes i have had and the quality was great.  they have a variety of menu items with small plates and full entrees.  they do some <mark><mark>Osetra Caviar Imperial 20g</mark> 20g</mark> but mostly more interesting variations as well as the s american dishes.  some of the items were:\nrock fish\n<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark>\n<mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark>\n<mark>Green Bean Tempura</mark>\n<mark>Berkshire Pork Belly</mark>\n<mark>Moqueca Mista</mark>. seafood coconut milk and rice with green onion\nyamato sushi roll(maguro, fois gras, <mark><mark>Osetra Caviar Imperial 20g</mark> 20g</mark>)\nuni shushi outstanding \ngreat sake list\n\nall the fish and shellfish were fresh and well prepared.\n\nit gets busy so we ate at the bar and the service was excellent there.  luna and maria can help with picking some great dishes at the bar.\n\nit is on the higher price side but worth it compared to a lot of other places where the food doesn't always live up to the expectations in vegas.  looking forward to next trip back there.", 
            "since this was downstairs in our hotel, the palazzo, and it was happy hour, we decided to stop by. it's only in the bar area though so we had to wait a little bit for a seat or open area at the bar. special fancy drinks for $6 and then also an assortment of appetizers for also $6 each. each portion is tiny so  getting food for multiple people so it can add up. we tried the yellowtail (2 pieces in an order), <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> roll, <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark> roll, <mark>Salt and Pepper Squid</mark>, and the enzo roll (i think that's what it called). the yellowtail was fresh and had a <mark>Uni</mark> sauce (lemongrass) that it came with. the first two rolls and the squid were ok. and the enzo roll was my favorite. it had salmon and these crispy bits in it and was rolled in like a white rice paper instead of seaweed. for drinks we all tried the fresca, which had muddled strawberries and a bunch of alcohols. i found it light, sweet and refreshing. all and all, a good place for a little something something before dinner. hh is definitely not enough for a full on meal and it's a little pricey but i guess better than a regular meal here.", 
            "ryan our waiter was really good and helpfull. i dont like sushi but he suggested to create them with <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark> and some spices and it was delicious.  will definitely come again.", 
            "this was our second time here. first was last august for lunch. last night for dinner. totally recommend making reservations, it was busy! we ordered the chicken teriyaki with <mark>Purple Potato Mash</mark>, so yummy. lobster taquitos and <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark> rolls were awesome.", 
            "disappointing are the first words out as i depart the resturant.  i applaud them for the boldness but the flavor profiles just do not blend. \n\nhamachi sashimi - although the fish was fresh the pureed sauce and red jalape\\u00f1o   kill off any flavor of the fish. \n\n<mark>Salt and Pepper Squid</mark> - good concept but over cooked. the squid was stringy. \n\nshisho peppers  - not cooked well as the size of the peppers varied from very small to very large. no consistency in the bake so the small peppers were overcooked and the large peppers were still a bit undercooked. \n\n<mark>Sasa Handroll</mark> - a <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark> with quinoa in a soy wrapper. the quinoa was aldente so the texture of the quinoa overpowered the entire roll. also the shrimp was smothered in saracha mayo so you could not taste the shrimp. \n\nsushi -\n  saba - a bit fishy\n  hamachi - nice thick cut\n  kampachi - stringy and a bit slimy\n  ikura - fresh and clean \n  uni - fresh and clean", 
            "you can't go wrong with their appetizer and small dishes here. we particularly like <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark> (crispy outside and extra soft inside!!), <mark>Tuna Tataki</mark>, <mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark>!\n\nwe ordered the popular miso <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> large plate, but we think it was ok not that special. \n\nwe really don't like japanese w<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> tobanyaki 2oz because they use coconut cream which makes everything way too creamy and heavy. i don't think coconut flavor go well with the meat too. \n\nhowever, their dessert is awesome! we love their peruvian chocolate cherry custard!! don't let the name fools you. it may sounds like nothing special but they have a special way to make it special. they somehow use chocolate crumble to mix with chocolate pudding and vanilla ice cream and cherry sauce is perfect combination!!!! would come back here again for the dessert itself.", 
            "we came to sushisamba for my birthday dinner a few days ago and i was blown away by the food! it definitely exceeded expectations.\n\nthe menu was so overwhelming we didn't know where to even begin and while our waiter didn't really help us narrow things down, he did make some good suggestions and helped us pace out the meal so we can order as we go. he came with the manager, who was very nice and gave us birthday shots, and also asked that we let him know if he could do anything. \n\nhere's what we started with: shishito peppers combo (grilled shishito peppers, tempura string beans with a truffle aioli, and edamame), <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark> in a spicy mayo sauce, <mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark>, and <mark>Crispy Hokkaido Scallop</mark> lettuce wraps. the peppers were a good surprise of the night because i didn't expect it to come with the string beans and edamame, but i definitely appreciated the greens in vegas! the <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark> was really tasty, but i wish it was a little crunchier when it came out. they tasted a bit soggy as if they were sitting in sauce for too long, but no complaints because the flavor was still there. the <mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> was good, but nothing really mind-blowing in my opinion. the <mark>Crispy Hokkaido Scallop</mark> lettuce wrap was phenomenal. our waiter said it was a new item on the menu and suggested we try it and it really blew us all out of the water. \n\nwe followed up the first round with the robata - we got the <mark>Berkshire Pork Belly</mark>, rib eye, <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>, and duck. all of them were so good, so make sure you pay a visit to the robata section when you visit! the duck and the rib eye to me stood out more than the others - they were cooked very well and had a good mix of <mark>Uni</mark> flavors.\n\nwe finished off dessert with their 4th of july special (red velvet cheesecake, frozen blueberries, and white chocolate ice cream) and sadly we were underwhelmed with what came out. i think we were so blown away by the entire meal, we felt like dessert was going to continue the streak, but were left wanting a bit more. either way, we were so stuffed it didn't matter and the dessert didn't take away from how much we liked the meal itself.\n\nwhat really set this over the edge is that the chef came out to shake our hands and chat with us really quickly, which i really appreciated! the service was great, the recommendations were on par, and the food was delicious. i would definitely recommend this spot for a special occasion - go ahead and gorge!!", 
            "i came for a bachelorette party last week on friday night around 11pm. my review is probably (ok definitely) biased because i was in such a bad mood at having to wait until 11pm to eat dinner. however, as you might imagine, 5 girls using one bathroom getting ready to go out in vegas is a production equal to cirque de solei that takes upward of 3 hours. but whatever we finally made it after a 15 minute, mile long cab ride down the strip from the cosmo to the palazzo hotel.  the restaurant was super dark (why don't they turn some lights on?) with huge tvs which were super loud. per the usual at many \"sceney\" type restaurants you could barely here the people across the table from you. \n\nwe got seated no problem as the restaurant was dead except for two or three big groups getting wasted in booths and a few lonely looking stragglers at the bar. our server was friendly but seemed to constantly be in a rush, although to go where i do not know. there seemed to be a ton of bus boys but very few wait staff. he could probably sense our frustration so he promptly brought out a wrought iron tree full of pink drinks. whether or not they had liquor was the only question (answer: not enough.) so we got a range of drinks, the best of which was a cucumber lime martini with vodka. after the night's beginning, i opted with straight vodka and diet coke.\n\nfor food we got a lot. some  memorable dishes were the <mark>Neo Tokyo</mark> roll with tuna which was solid, <mark>Heirloom Tomato Salad</mark> with sweet cilantro dressing, <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark>, <mark>Mushroom Tobanyaki</mark>, and sweet <mark>Coconut Rice</mark> side. my fave dish of all was the <mark>Heirloom Tomato Salad</mark> which was pricey but enough to share between 3 people. the rock shrimp was good but cliched, same as you would get anywhere else. the <mark>Mushroom Tobanyaki</mark> was interesting but not to my taste.  sadly we did not get dessert. \nin conclusion, i can definitely say i hope i will never be back with another bachelorette party, although i would not mind returning otherwise.",

            "it was fantastic!!  my girl and i went for dinner and drinks and had a blast.  everyone was beyond cool including our hostess and waitress.  our waitress was honest about everything and was not trying to get me to order a bunch of extra stuff.  we got the scallop small plate- amazing, <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark>- amazing, chilean <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> w/ <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark>- amazing fish and the corn was something new (not for me,) and the lima roll- very good!!!!  for drinks we has the pisco punch - yes please and 2 shots of some pink vodka goodness our waitress recommended.  everything was top notch.  the place is hip, trendy, what you want from a vegas dinner/pre-drink spot.  gals, including ourselves were decked out and fab!!  we made friends with the chicks next to us, was just so much fun.  the tables are close to one another, but we didn't mind at all.  \n\nto top the evening off, and these are the things that i remember, my eyelash was falling off (hahahaha!)  i couldn't get it back on and asked the hostess if she had any glue since i could see her huge gorgeous eyelashes were false as well.  she hooked me up!!  i was good to go!!!  \n\nthanks sushi samba!!  great evening!\n\nbtw- this place is $$$$ but we knew that going in.  \n\nloved it!!!!!!", 
            "since we were staying in the palazzo, i figured it would be easiest to dine in the hotel our first night in vegas. sushisamba sounded like a really interesting fusion of brazilian, peruvian, and japanese cuisine.\n\ninside i found a very lively, posh atmosphere. there was great music playing, giving it more of a club ambiance than that of a restaurant. i also liked the graffiti paint job on the walls. our waitress was tremendous, and the manager came to check on us periodically too. they definitely aren't lacking in the service department. all in all, this was a really enjoyable place to eat dinner.\n\nwe decided to go tapas style and order a bunch of different things to try. my dinner companion didn't have any preferences, so i ordered two small plates (<mark>Seared W<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> Beef</mark> <mark>Salt and Pepper Squid</mark>), two kinds of sashimi tiradito (kanpachi and tuna), and two samba rolls (<mark>Samba Strip</mark> roll and <mark>Sasa Handroll</mark>).\n\nour small plates came out first. i was excited to try the <mark>Seared W<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> Beef</mark>, which comes with a ponzu gelee, honshimeji mushrooms, and a truffled tofu crema. the meat was amazingly tender, and i liked the acidity of it all. even the mushrooms were very flavorful. the <mark>Salt and Pepper Squid</mark> was also very good. it comes with dry miso, shichimi, sea salt, crispy garlic, and smoked soy. this dish was definitely spicy. it was like calamari, but way better.\n\nnext up was the sashimi tiradito. the kanpachi (amberjack) comes with yuzu, sea salt, and black truffle oil. it was absolutely packed with flavor, and i enjoyed the saltiness of it. the tuna is served in a ceviche-style bath of granny smith apple, serrano peppers, and lime. it was beautifully sweet and spicy at the same time.\n\nwe were getting a little full, but we still had two samba rolls to go. the <mark>Samba Strip</mark> roll is a combination of <mark>Half Maine Lobster</mark>, mango, tomato, crispy rice, soy paper, and peanut curry. i absolutely loved the mango in there, which paired nicely with the peanut. the <mark>Sasa Handroll</mark> was very different from what you might expect sushi to be. it comes with <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark>, quinoa, shishito, cilantro, spicy mayonnaise, and red onion wrapped in some sort of cone. our waitress suggested we get two, since it's not very conducive to sharing. i agree. the sasa roll was a little difficult to eat, but well worth the effort. \n\ni didn't think we had waited very long for our dinner at all, but nonetheless the manager thought so, and to make up for it she brought over complimentary green tea sorbet pops for dessert. to put it mildly, they were amazing!\n\nsushisamba was absolutely top notch all the way around.", 
            "food was great!! we especially loved the <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark>. service was pretty quick. definitely a loud restaurant, so conversations are hard to hear. i'd recommend it to friends.", 
            "one of the many reasons i love the palazzo is the creepy-when-you-think-about-it facts that you can have a week long vacay and never really go outside. one of the other reasons i like the joint is... sushisamba. \n\nall fusion isn't created equal and most of what's deemed fusion in the multi-billion dollar tourist traps still doesn't cut it as top notch cuisine... but in three rotations over the years, the one thing i can say is that they've consistently delivered a good experience.  and that's more than i can say for a few others that are no longer at the palazzo.   it's also consistently noisy... do with that what you will. \n\nfavorites from the menu... <mark>Moqueca Mista</mark> (kinda hard to mess up fish stew with good ingredients ) and the <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> are my favorites of the full entries, which i wouldn't recommend on a first visit.  save big plates for your second or third go round.  almost anything with the w<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> is a hit; i think sushisamba drives the south american flavors home using fine japanese beef.  but if it works... \n\nthe yamato roll... epic as it is... to me, is **almost** overkill.  super indulgent <mark>Foie Gras</mark> and w<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> are almost a taste bud assault.   but at the same time, you have to try it-share it. the sa\\u00f5 paulo and the <mark>Neo Tokyo</mark> are my favorites here.   the <mark>Samba Strip</mark> is also pretty awesome.  again, pile enough good things together and see what happens. \n\nthe so so and not so on the menu... if anything ... rock shrimp (discontinued) and tiger <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark>.   mojitos are so so...( to me) as well.   the robata squid was literally hit and miss; had it once and it was great... and the next time... just rubber. \n\nall in all, come here with good company, a serious appetite and charge it to the room...i prefer early lunch or just after midnight.", 
            "the bartenders were friendly. the food was ok. i was expecting better flavor and quality for the price, but since i got to try things during their \"samba hour,\" it was worth it. we ordered from both the happy hour and regular menus and tried the amazonia, <mark>El Topo</mark>, <mark>Rainbow Dragon</mark>, and <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark> rolls, as well as the calamari and gyoza appetizers. the japanese-south american fusion is creative, but again, the quality is ok. my favorite of the bunch was the gyoza. 5 stars if you come during the samba hour because this place is a steal in vegas with the prices for the drinks and food. outside of samba hour, the quality doesn't justify the prices, so 3 stars overall.", 
            "i'm always a little skeptical of asian fusion cuisine, but this place does it right! our waitress was very helpful in guiding us through the menu, pointing out the more popular items. it is a \"tapas\" style menu, the plates are small and meant to be shared! we ordered: \n\n-<mark>Seared W<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> Beef</mark> gyoza: i think this was the best thing we ordered! the beef was soooo good and i loved the sauces on the side. \n\n-<mark>Berkshire Pork Belly</mark> ramen: everything in the ramen was very traditional, but the broth was very different from your typical bowl. it had a hint of lemongrass and some heat, which my boyfriend and i really liked (it kind of reminded us of tom yum soup). \n\n-<mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> and shrimp skewers: both came with a side of <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark>! so yummy! these are supposedly the two most popular of the anticuchos. \n\n-lima roll: a pretty standard <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark> roll. i would have rather tried another one of their small plates or tempura instead. \n\nbetween two people this was more than enough food. overall, a really great and satisfying meal with <mark>Uni</mark> flavors!", 
            "me and my wife came here for lunch and loved it. \nwe ordered green tea and was very good quality. \ni was reading other reviews and everyone mentioned the <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> skewers and <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark>. it was pretty good. <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> was very yummy but i would prefer to have less sauce. the yellow tail tacos were also very good and fresh. my favourite was the <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark>. just the right mix of sauce batter and shrimp. we ordered the <mark>El Topo</mark> sushi to top things off and it was not bad but wish i had more room to try other stuff. will definitely recommend and will come back for sure.", 
            "we started our happy hour with several nina frescas and classic mojitos.  fresh strawberry pur\\u00e9e, vodka, orange liquor, and guava.  spectacular and they were only $6 each. next we sampled <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> roll, <mark>Salt and Pepper Squid</mark>, w<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> goya, <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark> roll, chicken anticuchos, and yellow tiradito sashimi. everything was amazingly prepared and all of our choices were perfectly flavored. we sat at the bar and brian explained the menu in detail, recommended drinks, and made sure our service was on point.  everyone at the restaurant was friendly and focused on customer service.  the music and atmosphere was hip and entertaining.  we will be back on our next vegas trip. you can also ask for jason; he will make sure that all of your detailed requests are handled."

            "i've been jaded by the whole fusion cuisine fare as there's so many that have done it terribly wrong.\n\nthis isn't the case at sushi samba.\n\nmy wife and i decided we take a chance and boy we were impressed.  i let our waitress know that we'd just like to try \"whatevers good\" and to please do not hold back...\n\nwe were entertained with 4 different sashimi dishes, tuna with a granny smith green apple puree, kampachi in truffle oil, squeeze of lime & some sea salt, salmon in mandarin orange reduction & kampachi in some sort of chile vinegrette... all awesome.\n\nnext we were served with some items from the robata, although the end pieces of the <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> did come off a bit dry, the prep, grilled green onion and center of the piece made up for it... i would of liked it not so seared but still great flavors.\n\nthis was also my first time having a ceviche with passion fruit sauce, let alone a lobster ceviche.. it was absolutely delicious. the sauce <mark>Shrimp and Vegetables</mark> were super colorful but all the flavors complimented each other nicely. a tiny bit of sourness from the passion fruit to substitute the <mark><mark>Osetra Caviar Imperial 20g</mark> 20g</mark>, and some truffle oil made it taste super buttery.. super delicious.\n\nthere were a couple other dishes that weren't as memorable, but were still very delicious.  eitherway, it didnt break our bank and i enjoyed our \"early dinner\".\n\nservice was great. pretty standard for all the restaurants there (we went to the las vegas, nv location in the palazzo)"

            "the quality of the sushi was decent and the staff was nice - but my biggest complaint was the fact that they wouldn't accommodate my request to turn their <mark>Alaskan King Crab</mark> california roll into a rainbow roll...i mean seriously, that is such a simple change.  they told me the kitchen didn't like special requests like that.  stupid!!", 
            "i'm not a sushi purist, i love the fusion crap :)  i would give them 4 stars but they ran out of <mark>Alaskan King Crab</mark>.  how do you run out of something that makes up the base for many different items/rolls u serve.  we ordered something called the yamato roll which was pretty good except for the fact that it was $19 for 3 pieces.  it was the only roll that didn't have the standard 5-6 pieces.  for that much money i was expecting much more pop.  i love anything with <mark>Foie Gras</mark> so i may have liked the yamato roll more than i should've.  however, if you don't like <mark>Foie Gras</mark> skip it and get something else.  the miso <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> was fantastic just like the waiter described.  what bothers me is that they keep telling you how little the portions are after u order the dish which makes u order it twice or more  if you're with two plus people.  the miso <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> was like $16 for one skewer.  the food is good but be warned if you want to leave full you will spend a lot of money.  good thing it was comped thanks to my buddy.\n\nps  the chef's sushi/sashime does not come with straight sashime.  it was one sushi roll with some nigiri.",

            "ok now we were staying at pallazo and wanted to try out this restaurant. it was somewhat crowded when we got there on valentine's day weekend although i should say i have never seen vegas this empty compared to previous years during such holidays.  my first impression of the restaurant wasnt as expected, the tables were somewhat worn out and chipped at on the surface, and due to the place being crowded the tables and chairs were very close to the neighboring tables, it felt like the people who were setted next to us were actually sitting with us.  so that was kinda annoying.  ok enough of negative :) now the positives.  our waiter was excellent.  i wanted to eat sushi but i was thinking of trying different things on the menu, therefore our serves suggested that we order this special that they have.  he asked us how much we wanted to spend and according to our budget he would bring different dishes so we could basically taste their whole menu and have variety of foods.  our waiter stated that if we dont like any of the food that is being served he would be happy to replace it with something else.  i was ready to spend around 70 a person so he started off according to my budget.  we had different variety of sashimi, cut rolls peruvian dishes with mushrooms and duck, <mark><mark>Alaskan King Crab</mark> Leg</mark> etc.  he served us with 7 different dishes and we basically told him to skip the desert since we were very full at that point.  the verdict----good food, excellent service.", 
            "thursday night. 9pm. \nour reservations were honored to the minute and the man who runs the show, mike durovsik, at once made us feel not just like welcomed guests but old friends.\n\nmy fiance and i were indulged with a 9 course specialized server's omakase. the food was superb, and the service exceeds even the best definitions of accommodating. \n\nour charming and attentive server asked immediately how adventurous we were willing to get, and since we had no objections to anything particular, our meal immediately commenced.\n\nfirst was the otsumami, three small dishes: <mark>Green Bean Tempura</mark> with a creamy truffle aoli dipping sauce (incredible), shishito peppers charcoal grilled and just the right amount of spicy, as well as edamame sprinkled with sea salt.\n\nnext came hamachi (yellowtail) tacos paired with a fizzing sort of vinegarette (spicy aji panca) on the side to top it off- this was filled with so much flavour it literally forced my eyes to roll back. a real treat that i'd highly  reccommend.\n\nat this point it was quite apparent that service and timing was top notch. the bottle of sake we brought was being chilled tableside and water never fell below the 2/3rds mark. as the bottle chilled we tasted two different cocktails-  kumori, a cucumber cocktail with shochu and nigori which was refreshing, easy, and delicious.  alongside was the ever popular nina fresa, a strawberry cocktail with vodka. both made for easy, yet yummy drinking.\n\ntheir mushroom toban yaki was divinely creamy- we got ours with bincho tan grilled lamb on top which paired quite nicely with those garlic chips. their were five different kinds of perfectly cooked mushrooms in the mix, and all around it made for a <mark>Uni</mark> filling appetizer. my fiances words: that fu**ing amazing lamb dish ;)\n\nthe sashimi tiradito i'm always raving about came next. still on a midblowing level, i noticed that their are different flavour notes (though served with the same ingredients) for the nyc location and the las vegas one. so if you think you've had it before, you haven't. though different, the fish is always immensely fresh and the taste accents are truly wonderful. my favorite is the kanpachi since i'm a sucker for yuzu (japanese citrus) and my fiance was a big fan of the hamachi- if you're torn, go with the assortment of all four and you won't have any regrets.\n\noff the robata grill (bincho tan charcoal) came the most decadant <mark><mark>Alaskan King Crab</mark> Leg</mark> imaginable- our taste buds were literally in shock from the mastermind talents of chef oscar toro. bedded atop rock salt, the crab was creamy, fell apart smoothly, and the flavours enhanced the entire piece of already fresh seafood. a seasonal dish that may not always be available... so wonderful. if they don't have it on menu, go for the spiny lobster.\n\nalso from from the robata grill we enjoyed the miso glazed <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> with baby corn. again, this dish can be done so many different ways at different high end japanese restaurants- but sushi samba's brazillian take really heightens the tastes.\n\nask for the freshest oysters of the day- you can go with <mark><mark>Osetra Caviar Imperial 20g</mark> 20g</mark>, paired with yuzu jelly and lemon, or a more contemporary take which chef oscar toro will create specially for that oyster.- both ways are unforgettable.\n\nmy absolute favorite dish is the kobe ishiyaki. you grill fresh pieces of perfectly marbleized kobe tableside 3-5 seconds on each side on an extremely hot river stone. you get 4-5 sauces and and array of salts to mix up the taste buds for you- absolutely the most decadently delicious dish. whenever i see this i must have it, and sushi samba's is the best i've had. not enough people indulge in this and you must must must!!! \n\nour sushi/sashimi platter was fresh and wonderful- exquisite. we got the <mark>Neo Tokyo</mark> and the <mark>El Topo</mark> rolls- <mark>Neo Tokyo</mark> has tuna and a bit of spicy to it, and the <mark>El Topo</mark> is served warm- a surprising aspect, but the melted mozzarella is such a <mark>Uni</mark> addition. it's like the movie \"<mark>El Topo</mark>\" you must try/ see both! \n\nfor dessert we went with mochi; a soft and chewy japanese dessert that is <mark><mark>Osetra Caviar Imperial 20g</mark> 20g</mark> not overly sweet. sushi samba adds ice cream to the center and offers all the best flavours. \n\nby the end of our meal and a finished bottle of sake, we were both more than pleasantly buzzed and satiated with an incredible meal. \n\n\n**************\nbottom line, if you are trying to decide between nobu and sushi samba, pass on nobu and put some samba in your seafood!!\n\nthank you again mike and oscar for such a wonderful night!!", 
            "my dad picked out this place to go to dinner when he was in town this weekend.  i had never been, and i love sushi, so i was totally ok with his choice.\n\nwe arrived and looked at the menu, but ended up not needing it as we settled on the option our server gave to us... tell her our likes and dislikes, and they'd make a custom menu for us to try a bunch of everything.\n\nwhat followed was a lot of food that we would have never ordered... and we were delighted at the items they brought us.  our favorite was the chilean <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>, which was so tasty.  it came with <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark>, which is like huge overgrown corn.  we also really enjoyed the yellowtail seviche taquitos and the <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark>, as well as a few of the numerous sushi rolls they had brought at the end.  and our meal also included giant <mark><mark>Alaskan King Crab</mark> Leg</mark>, some peruvian sashimi, and at least one or two dishes i'm failing to remember.\n\nthe music was a little loud and not to my dad's taste, but that's typical in vegas.  the meal was definitely a <mark>Uni</mark> experience, and we wouldn't have stumbled upon half the dishes without letting the chef do his thing.  i highly recommend you dine in this fashion if you visit sushi samba.", 
            "amazing food, excellent service, open atmosphere with a trendy feel and even a nice bathroom!  \n\nthere were 7 of us and everyone was happy with their food.  they bring out your food as it is ready, which worked quite well and we did not feel rushed at all.  they also have a fun drink menu. \n\nthe menu has a lot of options for sushi and non-sushi treats.  there is a lot to choose from and it's nice to get a few different things to try.  everyone at the table ordered different things including shrimp, chicken, duck, beef, soup, sushi etc etc etc.  there was not a complaint from anyone, not even the super foodies! \n\ni had the yellowtail tiradito and it was an incredibly flavorful appetizer.   the pacific roll with <mark>Alaskan King Crab</mark>, asian pear and a wasabi-avocado crema was excellent.  it was a generous size and it was different than your typical sushi offering.  \n\ni highly, highly, highly recommend the <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> & miso skewers.  the texture is perfect and the flavor is spectacular!  three of us ordered it and left not a crumb on our plates.\n\ntakeaways?  fast all day.  go to sushi samba in the venetian/palazzo.  drink fun drinks.  order a la carte and enjoy the options.  eat the <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> or you are missing out.",

( isaac was the best!) i would recommend this place to anyone, especially if you love seafood. definitely worth it! i can't wait until i am in vegas again to eat there!", 
            "i had the chance to go back this past weekend and got a completely  different experience the second time around at sushi samba. \n\nafter a fun filled weekend adventure in vegas, we decided to give ss another shot. it was my cousin's birthday, and we figured we would stop by for a farewell vegas-birthday dinner. we stayed at the venetian, which made ss a stone throw away. we couldn't have came at a better time, the environment was so much more personal than the time before. i highly recommend avoiding peak dining hours if possible. this will give you time to enjoy your meal while getting some extra attention from servers. since we arrived at around 4pm on a sunday, the timing was perfect. \n\nour party grabbed a couple dishes and shared them all. this was the perfect way to sample everything. we started our mission into japanese/peruvian/brazilian adventure with...\n\notsumami: a mix of three appetizers. edamame, fried green beans, and grilled shishito peppers. my absolute favorite was the shishito peppers. they were doused in sea salt and lemon, and one out of every couple were spicy. perfect mix to the subtle hues of the edamame. \n\nyellowtail seviche: little tiny tacos filled with a mixture of yellowtail, onions, avocado and a side of chile sauce. these little babies packed a flavorful punch!\n\nnext up was the smoked <mark><mark>Alaskan King Crab</mark> Leg</mark>: wood fired, served in the half shell, perfectly cut and smothered in a signature sauce. these were so delicious and just melted in my mouth like butter!\n\nround four, <mark>Broiled Peruvian Bay Scallop</mark>: served in the shell as well, perfectly cooked. you can tell that they know how to prepare their seafood because everything tasted so fresh. this was my cousin's favorite dish and her first time ever trying <mark>Scallop</mark>. \n\nthen came out the <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark>. we could hardly eat anymore, however we asked for the most flavorful, scrumptious items, and intended on finishing them! after that, the yellowtail sashimi. it had spicy blended orange sauce on it, that was the perfectly paired with the fish. my personal fave of the night. \n\nmake sure to order a signature cocktail while you are there. we had a couple (after all, what kind of birthday is complete without drinks?), and the one that really stood out was the chu-cumber. it was like you were drinking the most exquisite cup of tea mixed with the cool tones of cucumber, all while getting a little buzz on. \n\nmy taste buds are so happy that i gave sushi samba another shot. the best part was, management remembered that it was my cousin's birthday, and brought out a little slice of carrot cake with ice cream and sparklers crowning the top. it was definitely a birthday dinner that we will all remember.", 
            "this restaurant caught my eye because it was something out of the ordinary from your typical sushi restaurant. the menu offered an intriguing variety but when i began reading the reviews i knew i had to try it. i would suggest anyone going there for the first time to try the dining experience because you may think you know what you want but the chef knows better! the server asks if there is anything you do not like or if you have any food allergies and then how much money per person you're looking to spend. there are options anywhere from $50 per person to $130 per person if kobe beef if something that interests you. as it was for a special occasion we opted for $80 per person and even though thats more than i have probably ever spent on a single meal there were no regrets.\n\ncourse #1 consisted of berkshire pork gyoza which is basically pork dumplings in a pumpkin puree and yellowtail ceviche taquitos, both of which were absolutely delicious and not necessarily something i would have ordered on my own.\n\ncourse #2 was yellowtail sashimi in a spicy peruvian sauce with a slice of red jalapeno on top and octopus sashimi in a japanese citrus sauce which again were both to die for!\n\ncourse #3 had an array of <mark>Filet Mignon</mark>, <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>, <mark>Alaskan King Crab</mark> and <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark>. all were moist and tender but the <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> absolutely melted in your mouth! <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark> was a yummy alternative to <mark><mark>Osetra Caviar Imperial 20g</mark> 20g</mark> as well.\n\nfinally, course #4 was the main sushi dinner. <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark> rolls were delicious, but the <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> with i believe tuna on top was absolutely amazing! there was also <mark>Half Maine Lobster</mark> and another roll which i believe had lobster in it as well and was probably the only thing of the entire dinner that i was not absolutely amazed with, but it was still good!\n\nanother great thing about this place is they tell you if there is anything throughout this meal you do not like they will take it back and bring you something else! as our server said, \"its like a money back guarantee!\"\n\nanyways this is definitely a place i would tell everyone who loves trying new things to try or even just the sushi lover. do it! it will not disappoint!\n\nonly part i would complain about is the fact that there is not one in california!!!", 
            "japanese/brazilian fusion is an intriguing concept.  the good: <mark>Green Bean Tempura</mark> with black truffle aioli, antichuco tenderloin with <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark>, and warm banana chocolate pie.  as far as sushi rolls go: just because you combine a bunch of flavors together doesn't necessarily make them tasty.  the <mark>Alaskan King Crab</mark> roll with pear was downright odd.  it was served with some type of avocado crema that was not complementary to the crab.  everything overpowered the fish, in fact i'm not even sure if the roll contained fish.  a green envy roll advertised a wasabi pea crust that i thought would give it crunch. negative.  just a light dusting to give the roll yet again an odd flavor.  if you enjoy more <mark><mark>Osetra Caviar Imperial 20g</mark> 20g</mark> sushi this will not satisfy the craving. however, for light appetizers and drinks this makes for a good spot.", 
            "i almost want to give this a 5. near oh my god moment, but not quite.\n\nthis is a little misleading. i swear this came up under \"chinese\" on yelp while we were looking for something (in a group <mark><mark>Assortment of Four</mark></mark>) but this is definitely not chinese. it's japanese brazilian fusion, which i had never had, but was awesome. the menu is a bid daunting, but the waitress offered to bring out a tasting menu for us, based on the common questions like, \"are you ok with raw fish,\" \"do you have allergies,\" \"how do you eat red meat,\" etc. this was helpful - usually i'm not fazed by the large menu, but for some reason i was having problems focusing. worth mentioning they say up front that they'll take back anything we don't like, no charge, and they do ask for a budget to keep them in line.\n\nwhat we got was really pretty exceptional. gyoza steamed and pan fried, hamachi taquitos (not what you're thinking - not the deep fried rolls, but little taco shells filled with hamachi sashimi), seared tuna with baby greens and crunchy salt, and portabella fries with kabocha aioli. all sounds fancy, all really good.\n\nthen a warm plate - grilled <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> with a sweet glaze, <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> (not their a5 w<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark>, which we were offered for an upcharge, but declined) and <mark><mark>Alaskan King Crab</mark> Leg</mark>, all with a side of elote. the bass was good - tender and flaky, and i like the glaze. but it was crazy overpowered by the beef and crab. firstly, the beef was far superior to what we had at n9ne. tender, flavorful, and with a great salt and pepper crust on the outside, served with a little pile of powdered chile for dipping. and the crab was that near oh my god moment. an *enormous* <mark><mark>Alaskan King Crab</mark> Leg</mark>, brushed with a sort of thick butter sauce, served piping hot. wow, this was exceptional. and while i guess i should expect it, points to the restaurant for realizing that serving a filet and a <mark><mark>Alaskan King Crab</mark> Leg</mark> family style to diners that have only chopsticks required that you slice things up in to nice little bite sized pieces.\n\nfinally, sushi. their <mark>Neo Tokyo</mark> roll, which is their version of the <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark>, a hamachi roll with spicy crab and avocado on top, a tuna roll with asparagus, dusted with wasabi, and an assortment of sashimi and nigiri. as well as a hot roll - something covered in melted mozzarella, crispy onions and a sweet sauce. all of the cold rolls were good - i especially liked their <mark>Neo Tokyo</mark> roll. the sashimi was also very good, but the hot roll...i could do without. it was in interesting twist - not just the cheese was hot, but the entire roll, rice and all. however, the cheese and a heaping helping of onion and sauce overpowered whatever might have been inside. this was about the only misstep i could find.\n\nthe atmosphere is odd - lots of pounding techno music, along with an odd video collage (on many many video screens) of brazilian beach babes, bullet trains, brazilian slums, and japanese salarymen trudging to their soul-murdering jobs. not sure what they were going for. but whatever.\n\ngreat spot - chinese though it wasn't, we all were appropriately full when it was over (not hungry, no stuffed) and we all agreed we'd be back. the total bill, excluding drinks, was probably about $65 per person. i loved the mix of appetizers, hot beef and seafood, and sushi. if you're going with a group, this is a fun way to try stuff without having to worry about reading a menu.", 
            "oh yea! love me some sushisamba! ive dined here a few times and its always been awesome.\ni always start out with a watermelon mojito... its amazingly refreshing.\nmy favorite app is the crispy yellowtail taquitos. i don't even know how to describe them apart from saying they re like putting heaven in your mouth.\ni also always order the pacific roll. its  <mark>Alaskan King Crab</mark>, avocado, asian pear, soy paper, wasabi-avocado crema. the pear in the roll really brings out the yellowtail and the wasabi is the cherry on top.\nand also you cant forget to order the <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark>. its amazing.", 
            "i've eaten at sushisamba many many many times and have never written a review until now.  there's never been a reason for me not to write a review but since i've been actively writing format of my other jaunts i figured its about time to do it here!  \n\nanyway, i usually spend my time at the bar.   personally i think it's the best place to sit back, enjoy great sake and have a fine meal while engaging with others.  plus, i have absolutely never experienced a moment of bad service in the two years and 15-20 times a year i've been to samba.  everyone behind the bar is always incredibly friendly, and though the faces change occasionally, it's always a pleasure to see the usual staff.  they always have a friendly smile and engaging conversation, obviously not for long as they have their work to do and other customers, but i see they treat everyone around the bar like family.  no wonder why i keep coming back!  \n\nmy last visit was saturday march 2nd and i had a guest with me.  as always the service was outstanding and the ladies behind the bar went above and beyond to make our night special.  the food as always was fantastic!  we ordered the kobe hot rock at the bar with thinly sliced japanese a5 beef and cooking sauces, fun and entertaining tools your own special little treats.  we also hade surf and turf tacos as well as some amazing <mark><mark>Alaskan King Crab</mark> Leg</mark>.  my date had a great time and we enjoyed a wonderful sake pairing with our meal and i enjoyed a great night of which i hold everyone working that night partially responsible. :)\n\nneedless to say, i recommend samba to anyone who wants to have a good time, good food, and great service!  do what i do, sit at the bar, enjoy the people watching, and get to know your bartenders.  they are awesome!",

            "this is a \"must go\" place for me while in vegas. \n\nwe always give the server a budget and have them surprise us.   they always pick things you wouldn't naturally gravitate towards, but are amazing dishes!   my favorites are:  <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>, yellow tail tacos, crab cakes, and <mark><mark>Alaskan King Crab</mark> Leg</mark>.   \n\ngreat customer service as well!", 
            "to start off i was not expecting to be blown away with this place but i was!! everything from this restaurant was beyond my expectations.\nwent there for a special treat and oh my... we had one.\n\nfirst off i would not say the sushi is extraordinary, in fact its standard but i did love the yellow tail scallion there more than i do at most places, but the items on the menu other than sushi is what got me!\n\nfirst and for most  the drink tower is amazing and <mark>Uni</mark> from the appearance to all the different varieties like the cucumber one, strawberry, grapefruit, and so on...we tried total of 6!!. my favorite was the one with the cucumber and the one with the mint cant recall the actual names due to all the drinks ; ) \n\nnow on to the mealsssss the ones i loved would have to be the steak tacos, best i had in a really long time and the sauce that they come with has a little kick that makes it all so complete. another one would have to be the <mark><mark>Alaskan King Crab</mark> Leg</mark> cut in perfect portions to be grabbed with the chop sticks and topped off with a cream sauce was sooooooooo good!! there was also the miso <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> if you like the taste of the miso flavor and appreciate <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> like i do its a must, even though my last bite on the skewer was not as great as the first 3 ; ( and my favorite dish of the whole night would have to be the in shell <mark>Scallop</mark>!!!! i had never seem my <mark>Scallop</mark> served in a shell till i went to this place, they were cooked with perfection and had some sort of pesto butter topping them off. i can literally eat so many and never have enough!! \none more dish worth mentioning would have to be the tempura shrimp even though i am not a fan of most fried foods this one was good!! and the portion was giant!\n\nas far as the dessert i am usually one to clear out all the plates but this was not the case for me, we got the mochi variety dish but it was too frozen it didn't do the mochi justice, and our other dessert consisted of friend bananas (which i am not a fan of) and coconut cream and the best coffee ice cream i have ever had! this meal was a fun teat and experience and the staff was amazing! \n\nanother tip on the side is make reservations, it was packed when we got there...", 
            "on the saturday of my bachelorette party, my girlfriends treated me to dinner at sushi samba.  it was a fabulous, memorable meal, where we ate well and celebrated in style.\n\nwe were staying at the palazzo, and sushi samba was the perfect venue for the occasion.  it was convenient to get to in heels, and the atmosphere was festive, edging on clubby without being obnoxious.  we had a big comfortable table, and service was excellent.  i wish we'd gotten the name of our waiter - he did a great job attending to our every need, and he guided us through the whole dining experience with expertise.  (for management - he was a tall guy who served a party of nine on 6/29.  you know, your only bachelorette party of the month?)\n\nwe ordered cocktails, which were pretty good.  i had a blame it on rio, a caipirinha variation with cacha\\u00e7a, agave syrup, fresh lime juice, cucumber, and jalape\\u00f1o.  it was both cool and spicy, and it went down really easy.  the classic caipirinha was also great, with just the cacha\\u00e7a, lime, and sugar.  i also tried some of the chu-cumber, a shochu drink with hendricks gin, elderflower liqueur, and muddled cucumber - very refreshing.  at some point, we got a complimentary cocktail tree, a beautiful iron tree bearing shot-sized wine glasses on every branch.  they held some frothy, sweet version of a screwdriver that was great for the occasion.\n\ndinner was delicious.  we had the option of ordering a la carte or omakase, and we decided to keep things simple.  we specified a price point and listed dietary restrictions, and the food just started coming.  it was all served family style, and everything was well portioned for our big group.  we left full but not overstuffed - a plus, since it had taken a team to stuff me into my white dress for the night.  the cuisine was fun, a creative, unforced fusion of japanese and peruvian styles.\n\nfirst, we had a trio of vegetable otsumami, all served together in a lovely green array.  there was the staple edamame with sea salt and lime, and <mark>Green Bean Tempura</mark> served with a rich black truffle aioli.  my favorite of the three, though, was the handful of shishito peppers.  these were grilled blistering black, polished with sea salt and lemon.  they were pretty irresistible.  next we got a tray of japanese a5 <mark>Seared W<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> Beef</mark> gyoza.  these were great, thin-skinned and stuffed with luscious hunks of beef rather than the usual mince.  they came with kabocha pumpkin pur\\u00e9e, a sweet soy drizzle, and a su-shoyu dipping sauce.  the best thing i ate all night, though, was a crispy taquito overflowing with yelllowtail, avocado, and roasted corn miso.  the shell was thin and crunchy, and the fresh, tender fish was just right with that avocado, miso, and some thinly sliced vegetables.  the taquitos were served with spicy aji panca sauce and fresh lime - that piquant, frothy sauce was just the icing on a beautiful fusion taco cake.\n\nafter the smaller plates were done, we moved on to big platters of sushi and sashimi.  i do not remember everything we got, as there were at least six or seven rolls and even more kinds of sashimi.  the rolls were great, a nice mix of california standards - you know, the mix and match of eel, yellowtail, tuna, etc. with avocado, cucumber, and dots of mayo - and more samba-specific stuff, with the stray <mark><mark>Alaskan King Crab</mark> Leg</mark> and lobster claw.  i particularly liked the <mark>Samba Strip</mark>, with <mark>Half Maine Lobster</mark> tempura, mango, tomato, chive, soy paper, and a coating of crispy rice.  it was unusual and flavorful, served with a peanut curry.  the rest of the platter came with a sweet thick soy sauce and a bit of mayo.  the sashimi was more traditional, served on a bed of ice.  it was hard to share, as there was only one of each kind, but the slivers i had were great.\n\nthe most filling part of the meal was the churrasco course.  we got two hefty platters of the <mark>Rio Grande</mark> with three meats, grilled hanger steak, ribeye, and chorizo.  these were great, juicy and tender and full of that hearty grilled meat flavor.  they came with a trio of dipping sauces - malagueta pepper oil, chimichurri, and a third that is infuriatingly absent from the menu.  we also had some sides of rice, beans, collard greens, and a medley of <mark>Roasted Seasonal Vegetables</mark> - giant corn kernels, toothsome brussels sprouts, carrots, celery, pearl onions, and more.  we also got miso-marinated chilean <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> a la carte, with roasted organic vegetables and oshinko.  this was a winner - the fish was moist, flakey, and shot through with miso flavor.\n\nwe were full by dessert, but loved the complimentary chocolate mousse, served with a sparkler and a congratulatory message.  the lush mousse came topped with crunchy chocolate pearls, whipped cream, and a little bit of candle-stuck banana.  we each got a sweet bite to end our wonderful dinner.\n\nin conclusion, my friends are the best - thank you girls for this weekend, and for this fun, delicious meal.  sushi samba was an a+ choice, worthy of a night i won't soon forget.", 
            "oh my goodness. i would have to say the dinner i had here was one of the best treats i've had this year! i am so for<mark>Tuna</mark> to have gotten this experience that i will never forget. it was so awesome! if coming here, i'd suggest making reservations because it is jam packed, but only because it is that good. the environment is bustling and vibrant. so. much. fun! \n\nwhen my friends showed up we got seated right away were introduced to the chef who told us he had many special dishes on their way. first off they presented us with a tower of drinks! all mini glasses of their specialty cocktails. so awesome! there were four of us and they brought us a total of 3 towers, so we each got to try 6 different flavors. loved it so much. the variety was just amazing. i'd have to say my top 3 favorites were the chu-cumber (cucumber flavored one), the lemon samurai, and pisco sour (i have visited peru before so i've had the opport<mark>Uni</mark> to try an authentic version of this before). so so great!\n\nall the meals brought out for us to share were fantastic! the <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark> was different a cool blend of flavors to add to our palette. the <mark><mark>Alaskan King Crab</mark> Leg</mark> were perfection! and my other favorite dishes were the mini tacos and the shelled <mark>Scallop</mark>. so amazing! other fantastic dishes i got to try were the <mark>Salt and Pepper Squid</mark>, <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark> (amazing), miso marinated <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>, <mark>Chicken Teriyaki-Samba Style</mark>... like i said. one. amazing. experience!!! i can't wait to come back again.", 
            "open late! the sushi here was awesome! the service was ok... i wanted to give this place a 5 star but the waitress insisted on letting us know about the drama in the restaurant repeatedly. we had a <mark>Soft Shell Crab Roll</mark> that was to die for.. fresh crab in the roll along with a <mark>Alaskan King Crab</mark> claw with the fresh claw meat still in it. we ordered a roll that was to have no rice and as a substitute for the seaweed they use cucumber that is sliced thin to wrap around the sashimi inside. unfor<mark>Tuna</mark> after waiting for about 20 min for this roll the waitress came to tell us they made a mistake in the back and no longer have the cucumber. in order to make up for it they gave us a roll they made in error on the house. all in all i would come back, but might avoid the waitress as i feel she aired to much of the internal problems to us.", 
            "i have been here probably at least 4x over the past year. i have never had a bad experience yet.  last night my aunt was in town visiting.  she was staying on the strip at treasure island so we decided to grab some sushi at the palazzo. \n\nthe otsunami appetizer of edamame, crispy green beans and green peppers is really good! it was the first time i had <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> skewers based on other yelp reviews and they did not disappoint! for sushi we had bobo brazil roll with is kobe beef, the sushi samba roll with the lobster claw and the lima roll with spicy <mark>Alaskan King Crab</mark> mix. also if you want a good cocktail the samba juice is really good!\n\nthey have a busy bar area to have some drinks, a nice sushi bar and a very lively atmosphere inside the restaurant. \n\nthe only downside if i had to give one is the rolls are relatively small for the price. however the quality is high! i would recommend checking it out if you are in the area.", 
            "went here when i was in vegas for a conference.  the meal i had here had to be one of the best meals i've ever had.  we had a group of 7 and we all got the chef's selection/om<mark>Ika</mark>.  the food just kept on coming and it was all amazing.  there was this one dish that i still dream about.  it was a <mark><mark>Alaskan King Crab</mark> Leg</mark> opened up with some kind of butter sauce within the shell.  it was one of the best things i've ever tasted.  i've been to a lot of high end japanese restaurants and this was the first om<mark>Ika</mark> where i was actually happy and satisfied after.  \n\nnot only was the food great but the service was amazing.  isaac our server was always on top of trying to keep us happy (and always made sure we had hitachino or sake topped off).  also, rannah the manager was amazing as well.  she took to the time throughout our meal to check up on us and make sure we were having an amazing time.  she even offered us recommendations on how to make the most of our time in vegas.  \n\nwe will definitely now be making sushi samba a regular occurence at our annual conferences/trips out to vegas", 
            "came here last second looking for lunch.\n\nthe decor here is really impressive... love the graffiti art! it was in palazzo so i don't think anything here would have stunk decor wise.\n\nwe were sat pretty quickly. we shared the edemame, <mark>Seared W<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> Beef</mark>, sashimi assortment (tuna, yellowtail, shrimp, and i forget what else..) i also ordered the lima, which is basically a fancy <mark>Alaskan King Crab</mark> roll.\n\nfood was... ok. maybe good, but definitely not great. presentation was nice.\n\noverall a bit expensive for what it was. waitress was really hot... but that's enough to give it 5 stars."

            "modern chic fusion restaurant in the new palazzo hotel, featuring brazilian and japanese food. the interior much reminded me of social house in treasure island, dark and swanky. the small plates are meant for sharing, but the tab adds up quick. the server proclaimed their sake menu as the largest in the country, but unfor<mark>Tuna</mark> we didn't get to try any.\n\nwe had the <mark><mark>Assortment of Four</mark></mark> sashimi which were nice and fresh with delicate flavors. my favorite was the tuna with granny smith apple, serrano, and lime.\n\nthe <mark>Hamachi Kama</mark> (yellowtail cheek) was as good as i've had, but missing the grated daikon that it <mark><mark>Osetra Caviar Imperial 20g</mark> 20g</mark> comes with.\n\nchicken liver anticuchos (two skewers served over <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark>) were very livery. i expected them to be only lightly livery, like my favorite pho ga place serves up, not sure if it's due to the prep or the <mark>Grade A5</mark> liver or what.\n\nwe also tried a couple rolls, the <mark>Neo Tokyo</mark> with yellowfin tuna, tempura flake, aji panca. i liked this one more than the bobo brazil with seared kobe beef, avocado, kaiware, shiso, red onion, chimichurri. the kobe beef looked raw rather than seared, maybe seared would have brought out the flavors a bit. both rolls were pretty good though.\n\nthe standout of the meal was the <mark>Berkshire Pork Belly</mark> butterscotch miso, which was meltingly tender, with a subtle sweetness contrasting the richness of the luscious pork.\n\nwe also tried the little tiny crabs we saw in an ad, sawagani, which are flash fried japanese river crabs. these were literally tiny, and the small bite had a texture like an egg shell, with a flavor best described as a subtle fish sauce.\n\ncome here if you have an appetite for a variety of small bites with delicate but well thought out flavors.",

            "dined here twice, once at the sushi bar and once at a table for 4.  sushi was the only menu items tried.  nigiri was pretty good, chu toro sashimi was expensive but good.  had a couple of rolls which were tasty.  we also tried the robata grilled caribbean lobster which was also nice.  had a couple of nice <mark>Sake</mark> here.  lots to choose from on the sake menu.\n\nwe dined on a tuesday afternoon for a late lunch and a late wednesday for dinner so the place was never very crowded.  we received good service both times.\n\ni liked it and both times were good but i have tried it now and probably will try other places.  it is worth a try.", 
            "we scheduled the sushi and sake tour.  it was $100 a person but completely worth it!!!!  you learned and tasted multiple <mark>Sake</mark> and you learned how to make sushi roles.   the hosts were terrific.  the food was amazing!!!   in addition to the sushi and sake, we were treated to appetizers and desert.   i love sushi and this experience and quality of food was at the top of the places i've been to.   100% recommend it!", 
            "it was a good experience to try something new in sushi, but there was nothing that really stood out in taste that would make me return. we took a lot of the server's recommendations for popular items like the specialty dishes <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> with <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark> and yellowtail taquitos served like tapas, which were both good. the <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark> was ok, but didn't seem to have a complimenting taste with the <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>. we let the server know and he brought out some <mark>Purple Potato Mash</mark> just to try something different and it was better than the corn. \n\nthe service was great. our server was very knowledgeable about the food, how it was prepared and the types of sake that was offered. we enjoyed 4 different <mark>Sake</mark>, which was more enjoyable than the sushi. \n\nif you want to feel like you ate a lot, stick with mostly rolls... the rice will help fill you up.\n\ntypical price for food in lv... $$$... although i didn't think we ordered that much and the cost was just short of the 200 mark for two.\n\ngood brazilian/peruvian fusion... but if i had a choice between this and <mark><mark>Osetra Caviar Imperial 20g</mark> 20g</mark>... obviously traditional.", 
            "in a city of over the top fabulousness, sushi samba is the real deal. from the extensive selection of cold <mark>Sake</mark> to inventive pairings of fish and sauce, it's a welcome relief from the other mega experiences on the strip. friendly wait staff and a lively atmosphere add to the enjoyment.", 
            "i wasn't feeling sushi, but i went with it. \nmy expectations were low, just another sushi bar in vegas...\nwe gave our server, veronica, a per-person budget and let her pick.\n\n i was blown away!\n\nwe were served mini tacos, <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> skewers, sashimi ceviche, <mark>Seared W<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> Beef</mark>, salt & <mark>Salt and Pepper Squid</mark> and more. the plates just kept coming. how did they get such incredible flavors into the food? i would put sushisamba up against the best. sure, nobu (malibu) may have great atmosphere, but the flavors, quality, variety, and probably 100 different <mark>Sake</mark> here, make them a strong competitor. \n\n\nservice was impeccable (ask for veronica).", 
            "came here with my gf and my cousin and his wife. he won big gambling so he said it was his treat. bad move cousin. we were eating kobe beef and ordering up expensive <mark>Sake</mark>. it was great. i got wasted. i inhaled some ramen at the end of the meal. great times.", 
            "sushi samba has some excellent tasting libations, meat dishes, and appetizers. their beverage manager is doing an excellent job with menu and service. the <mark>Sake</mark> (karaoke in the back bar) needs some help. the song list is short, the dj is a little clueless, and the signage for the nightly event is sorely lacking. don't worry if the front staff seems a bit pretentious; they are. but the back room staff and managers are great. the food is pricey when you don't realize that you ordered your 5th drink after your third song. you'll find it easy to make new friends at the karaoke. have fun.", 
            "i returned to sushisamba for the <mark>Sake</mark>, the guys in the back were great, bartender and dj. the front bartender, greeter, and wait staff again were unwelcoming and didn't even say hi as i walked in. this is not acceptable. they weren't that busy. there were 6-7 people in the back bar singing and drinking. the drink and app specials are pretty decent and quite delicious. i hope things get better or they might have to close down the karaoke part of this place.", 
            "decent sushi, great sashimi, awesome selection of <mark>Sake</mark>. definitely a great place to eat at when in vegas (healthier options, i suppose).\n\ngets incredibly busy so make sure to make reservations. \n\nthe <mark>Seaweed Salad</mark> is killer with a trio of three different types of seaweeds tossed in different sauces.\n\nthe plate of sashimi is to die for- super fresh fish and great variety. 15 pieces for $50."

            "for the true foodie, the only way to enjoy sushisamba is om<mark>Ika</mark> paired with a sake flight. both off the menu. you set the price (minimum $60 to sky's the limit for the max) and turn it over to the waitstaff who will take excellent care of you. i enjoyed the subtle inquiry and the detailed, passionate manner as each dish was described. a definite oral escapade and fun for the sight, smell, and sound (lava rock searing). dessert is not as strong as the savory dishes, but when paired with the coconut sake...yummy.", 
            "went here when i was in vegas for a conference.  the meal i had here had to be one of the best meals i've ever had.  we had a group of 7 and we all got the chef's selection/om<mark>Ika</mark>.  the food just kept on coming and it was all amazing.  there was this one dish that i still dream about.  it was a <mark><mark>Alaskan King Crab</mark> Leg</mark> opened up with some kind of butter sauce within the shell.  it was one of the best things i've ever tasted.  i've been to a lot of high end japanese restaurants and this was the first om<mark>Ika</mark> where i was actually happy and satisfied after.  \n\nnot only was the food great but the service was amazing.  isaac our server was always on top of trying to keep us happy (and always made sure we had hitachino or sake topped off).  also, rannah the manager was amazing as well.  she took to the time throughout our meal to check up on us and make sure we were having an amazing time.  she even offered us recommendations on how to make the most of our time in vegas.  \n\nwe will definitely now be making sushi samba a regular occurence at our annual conferences/trips out to vegas", 
            "we stayed at palazzo over the holidays and decided to try out this place.  i had made reservations for 9pm but arrived about 20mins early and was seated right away.  overall a decent experience.\nambience:  dark and somewhat trendy sushi fusion joint.  there is a bar area but the rest of the tables are set up in a funky circular fashion.  tables are pretty close to each other and you will not have a private dining experience.  \nservice:  for the most part good.  we were seated right away.  it did take a while for the server to get to us (and she apologized).  she didn't give us the sushi samba intro like i heard another server give the table next to us (explaining the whole fusion thing).  orders were taken and things proceeded to go smoothly.  there were no mistakes on our order.  we asked for sake recommendations and she appeared really knowledgeable.  she was decent in explaining their om<mark>Ika</mark> (pretty much no set om<mark>Ika</mark>).  food came out at a decent pace.  water was refilled quite nicely too.\nfood:  past review said that this was a great sushi place.  i disagree.  if you want the best sushi, you don't go to a fusion place in vegas for it.  if you want to try a different twist on japanese/brazillian cuisine, then this is the place. so i went here without much expectations.  highlights included the yellowtail taquitos (more like tacos).  i loved the sauce/foam that came with it.  very light and a nice way to wet your appetite.  <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> and lamb robata (sp?) were both really really good.  there was a sweet sauce on both.  <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> melted in your mouth.  came with 2 skewers.  the lamb was a decent size and was sliced thinly.  this was also a melt-in-your mouth experience.  i would order both again. we had one of their specials which was a white fish in a tofu sauce.  it was just ok.  we made the mistake of ordering a roll.  i think it was an el toro (or something like that) and it came with salmon, cilantro, mozerella cheese, among other things.  the flavor was ok, but the rice in the roll itself was really hard.  like they had premade it.  made the whole roll just awful.  i like their sake selection.  we passed on dessert.\nvalue:  just like vegas, things are pricier. but i thought the vibe was decent.  \n\nall in all, a decent date night place.  just don't come expecting over the top sushi.", 
            "sushi samba is a fantastic restaurant, serving authentic and fresh seafood.\n\nthe service was very good and the ambiance of this restaurant is pretty cool and hip.  but really it's about the food.  \n\ni totally agree with the tips from others on the miso glazed <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>, that is the #1 best dish, it was amazing.  we also had lots of sushi, the kobe beef dish with mushrooms and root veggies was super excellent also.\n\nto be honest, i don't know all the dishes we had as we let the chef decide, om<mark>Ika</mark> style.  but all of it was good, or interesting and it was very satisfying.  the chefs here are excellent.  this was my best meal in vegas in a while.\n\ni would also recommend the mixed drink caipirinha, which was also very tasty and i had several off.\n\ni can't wait to come back."

            "waiting for my friends at the bar located near their entrance, i had a good feeling about this place.  it had all the bells and whistles of a nice upscale restaurant with a friendly bartender to start.  unfor<mark>Tuna</mark> my good feeling about this place was short lived as our party was seated.\n\nour reservation was for 9:15 pm sunday night.  we didn't get seated until 9:45 pm despite having our whole party there by 9:00 pm.  i didn't care too much for this considering the place was moderately busy on a holiday weekend, and we weren't on a strict schedule.  so i let this roll easily off my back.\n\nas we were seated, we were greeted by our waiter who was terribly unenthusiastic about his job.  he was considerate about asking  for food allergies.  beyond that, all levels of consideration or customer service for that matter stopped there.  granted, he warned us that our food would come out infrequently, but little did we know it would delay our dinner by over an hour.  a little honesty would have been greatly appreciated.  it took forever for most of our food to come out.  we didn't have utensils or place settings even after our food was delivered.  my friend even asked for the manager, to complain about our horrible service, or lack thereof.  the manager's response was something like: \"things are are a bit backed-up, we'll give you free dessert.\"  now, i don't care how backed-up your kitchen is... that's still no excuse for horrible and incompetent service!  dessert only puts a band-aid on a broken arm... why the hell do restaurant managers  do this?  we are not looking to get something free, we just want to make sure they get their act together... and fast!\n\nour original waiter rarely came to our table after we ordered our food.  another waitress came to our aid who was very helpful and attentive to our needs.  she was very friendly and courteous, it's unfor<mark>Tuna</mark> she wasn't our original waiter because this review would've been completely different.\n\nour unpleasant waiter did the weirdest thing.  as my friend was talking to the manager, being very open about our waiters horrible service, our waiter stood by our table as he refolded all our used napkins, tossing them onto our table.  yes, our used clothe napkins.  who does that?  in front of a party that is pretty disgusted by you no less.  it seemed as if he knew he was already in hot water and didn't give a rats-ass about making up for it.  in addition, he circled the portion of our bill they decided to discount for the unsatisfied service in a stuck-up negative manner.  in hind site, my friend said we should have taken that same pen, in front of our waiter, and scratched out his tip!  of course, we're better than that.\n\nthe food is the only reason why this place is not getting a single star. the food was actually quite good with a variety of <mark>Uni</mark> asian-fusion plates.  i ordered the chicken teriyaki (exotic right?) which was much more than i bargained for.  for such a simple dish, it had a variety of <mark>Uni</mark> flavors with a side of extras that complimented each bite.  my friends ordered an array of food that looked just as good, and was commented on just the same.\n\nfor me, customer service will make or break any experience, no matter how good the food is.  in this case, their service failed horribly.  our party ended up with a waiter that was a few cans short of a six pack regarding personality, who would probably fare better as a chippendale's greeter than a restaurant waiter.  i hope management recognizes this and hires waiters that are actually qualified to interact with human beings.", 
            "one thing i'm a stickler for is definitely brazillian food. i know my brazillian from having an ex and bf who introduced me to it. i can cook it most definitely. i was at sushi samba for a party and they had passed apps which were great. great sushi, great crab cakes, awesome skewers of beef...but mind you passed apps. \nthe drinks....amazing. as far as the samba juice. this is the only place in town i know that mixes with acai berrys. which give a <mark>Uni</mark> chocolate hint to a blueberry flavor. definitely high in antioxidents.\nbut i came here for brunch with a friend. \nnow i sat at the bar and we ordered drinks. she ordered the pomelo...but they didnt't have any. so then the cucumber. i had the samba juice again. i decided to order churros because i love home made churros. too bad i didn't get them. grrr they took forever. i also ordered food to go. feijoada, chorizo, linguisa(kinda portuguese sausage) and some <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark> which is like giant hominy. \nwell the order was wrong because i ordered sides and  he asked me how i wanted my eggs. the bartender was really slow. i asked him some questions on why he was shaking a certain way and he said it was because they put egg whites in the drink. i explained a different method on how to make the drink that he won't tire himself out and he said \"no it's better my method\" lol i asked him where he worked before and he said...\"grand lux cafe\" yea nuff said. i didn't introduce myself to him because he was too hard headed in knowing what was right and wrong. so he fcked up my order, returned the churros when i asked him for it to go, and then he stiffs me on eggs on the bill. yea i'm gonna order from the table next time. i think brunch is for rookies. \nthe feijoada was very....thick....the chorizo and linguisa with hominy was delicious. they don't make it home made but they get it in cali from this spanish place i know. \nover all drinks are good. but i guess the staff being not so bueno made me drop the score down a lil.", 
            "my friends and i were staying at the palazzo and i thought to try sushisamba for my sister's bachelorette dinner.  we made reservations at 10:15pm and upon arrival the bar area and the dining area looked pretty full.  \n\nthe decor was dark and interesting, with black and white classic japanese films airing on a large big screen and some classy art/anime con another wall.  my friend and i had a discussion about how we appreciated the scene.    \n\ntheir menu features a wide array of items: small platters, appertizers, large platters, sushi.   i checked out their menu from the palazzo website prior so i knew what prices to expect.  we started off with a bottle of sake - they have a pretty extensive sake list - and the price was reasonable for a bottle of sake.  \n\ni had ordered the rock fish ($29) and it was prepared very elegantly and was also very very delicious -sweet and moist.  i let my friends sample my dish and everyone really enjoyed it. 2 of my friends ordered the teriyaki chicken ($25) and it wasn't your typical chicken teriyaki - the chicken was served with the bone in and was accompanied with <mark>Purple Potato Mash</mark> potatoes.  i think this was probably my favorite chicken teriyaki dish i have sampled before and the others agreed.  others at the table ordered sushi, ramen, fries, etc.  there were 9 of us and out of the group, it impressed 3 of us (1 person was myself).  i appreciate good quality food and i thought the prices were reasonable - it is las vegas and it is a trendy restaurant in the palazzo so it's expectable for the prices of cuisine.  most restaurants on the las vegas strip are usually typically pricey for the amount of food you receive anyway.  i typically like upscale restaurants.  on the other hand, the other girls at the table complained of hunger and that it was expensive.  they didn't agree that ramen for $18 was worth it - they are used to $5 ramen at a no-thrills restautant.  yes it is only ramen, but it had a delicate lemon grass flavor, it was a decent size, and it is generally a good price for an upscale restaurant.  so this review offers insight for 2 different perspectives.  it was light fare, but perfect for going out to clubs after.  \n\nservice was superb.  our waiter served us well; had friendly casual discussions periodically, and offered to take us into sugarcane - the club.lounge attached to the restaurant.  granted, the club/lounge was empty and only had 2 people dancing, it was a nice gesture and this review is solely based on the restaurant.  \n\nif you appreciate upscale quality food that emerges to be different and <mark>Uni</mark> in a chic environment try sushisamba :)", 
            "having been to their sister establishments; china grill co, i had high expectation for this place.  i am a huge fan of asian fusion anything.  i would give this place 5 except for the small tables we were sat at.\n\nthis place was extremely busy with your <mark><mark>Osetra Caviar Imperial 20g</mark> 20g</mark> down tempo music playing.  it has a huge projector screen displaying various images of sport or anime.  we made rsvp and got seated within 10 minutes.  \n\nhere we go, the host sat us right by the server isle between the entrance and the kitchen, not impress and not off to a good start.  after getting bumped several times i asked to be moved.  then they moved us to a table that was so close to another couple that we might as well been sharing the bill.  there was no room to move.  i told my girl to wash her hands first before sitting down because we have to pull the table out and asked the people on both side to excuse us.  so far, even worse start.  \n\nnow the food, we were told that the portions are small, so be prepared to order a lot and to damage the amex.  we asked for some recommendation from our server whom by the way was absolutely excellent and was there for everything we need.  he even apologized for the tomato can seating we were in.  we ordered the tuna taquitos which was <mark>Uni</mark> with taste and textured - 5.00 per pc.  we had the yellow tail carpaccio with yellow sauce - 18.00 for 5 pcs and worth every penny. i had the <mark>Filet Mignon</mark>,small and pricey but again worth it.  jennifer had the <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>, again soft and <mark>Uni</mark> flavors, we also had the <mark>Lamb Chop</mark> from the robata and it is the best <mark>Lamb Chop</mark> i had recently.  we also had a few rolls as well, small but delicious.  for desserts we had the donut holes dipped in melting chocolate.  again,the great taste!!!  \n\nthe service is impeccable, even with small tables, the drinks were <mark>Uni</mark> a bit soft, but the flavors were remarkable.  the portions are extremely small, but again, the taste are <mark>Uni</mark> - japanese with brazilian.  the table next to us were from europe (whom thought this place was as of value, i guest that what happens when you get a euro into a dollar; instant discount) recommend we try the sampler menu - 80.00 per person but 7 courses. the server did too.  the next time we will since we did spend over 200.00 there.  \n\nsushi samba is now my top 5 places to eat at, we can't wait to go back there in a few months.", 
            "sushi samba has been a hit or miss with yelpers, and here's my chance to check them out!  featuring a special \"election day menu\" with specialty cocktails and cheap appetizers, it was a perfect opport<mark>Uni</mark>!\n\ndrinks on the menu:\n* obamarama (blue) for $11 \"svedka citron, blue curacao apple liqueur, guava, blueberry\" - really good the first time around. pleasant to look at and just tasty-good.  the guys and gals enjoyed this drink.  the second time i ordered it, there was way too much alcohol though, and not in a good way.  a good cocktail should be enjoyable to drink; i passed the second one off.\n\n* maverick (red) for $11 \"pearl vodka, freshly muddled strawberries, orange liqueur, lime, guava\" - served in a martini glass, so a bit more delicate to drink.  pretty tasty as well. i enjoyed it.\n\nbites to eat:\n* shishito peppers ($2) \"grilled spicy peppers, sea salt and lemon\" - they give you a bunch of these peppers on a plate, and it was okay for me.  i tried one and found that to be good enough.  didn't really care for more.\n\n* <mark>Organic Chicken</mark> aji amarillo anticucho ($2) - i found the chicken to be okay, but really enjoyed the <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark> that came with the dish.  that was the best part of it.  our order had one skewer of chicken, but the party next to us had two? hmm... \n\n* spicy crunchy tuna roll ($3) - really good roll!  i liked this a lot and ordered myself another.  i like how they do their spicy sauce here; it's more mayonnaise-based.  and the slight crunch is nice too.\n\n* <mark>Salmon Avocado</mark> roll ($3) - pretty simple roll with just salmon and avocado.  but it was fresh fish and good.  i'm sad i didn't order more.\n\n* mini chicharron de calamar ($3) \"cornmeal crusted calamari with tamarind sauce, tomato salsa & plantain\" - our friend's order came out soggy, so they thought it was gross.  ours had a better crunch on it, so it tasted better.  it wasn't particularly exceptional, it was okay.  i don't remember any plantain in my dish though.  \n\n* japanese chicken wings ($4) \"teriyaki and sesame\" - it's hard to go wrong with teriyaki chicken wings, right?  good, but messy.\n\n* chilled oyster sampler ($4) \"ponzu jelly & tobiko with three oysters\" - really fresh oysters with an interesting ponzu jelly.  we were supposed to get another order before we left, so i missed out on more!  next time!\n\n* mini yellowtail seviche ($4) \"ginger garlic and soy\" - reminded me of hawaiian poke with the dressing.  it was good with the red onions mixed in there, more poke-like than ceviche-like though.\n\n* crispy yellowtail taquitos ($4) \"shiso, avocado, roasted corn miso and spicy aji panca sauce\" \\u00e2\" two different sauces to put over the taquitos, and it was good.  very messy though as it broke apart after the first bite and was dripping all over my hands.  our order came with two taquitos, but when our friend ordered it, he only got one!\n\n* rosca ($9) \"homemade doughnuts with hazelnut chocolate dipping sauce\" \\u00e2\" recommended by our bartender/waitress as her favorite dessert.  four doughnut holes arrived and they were just okay.  disappointing for us, and we wished we had chosen another dessert instead.\n\nwe spent the whole time at the bar because there was standing room only at this event.  so, the girl making our drinks also served us.  she was busy but tried her best to make our drinks were full and our orders were in.  (our drinks were good for the most part except for that second obamarama we ordered.  but hey, some people like more alcohol in their cocktails!)  i had a bigger problem with the kitchen output and their consistency.  with certain orders coming out, sometimes you got two of something and other times you got one.  our friend mentioned that we got more sushi in our order than when he ordered it.  (makes you wonder what happened to the other pieces.)\n\noverall, we had a decent experience at sushi samba.  you definitely can't beat the price and the atmosphere is casual, which is nice alternative at a strip hotel.\n\n3.5 stars.\n\nthey also offer a happy hour (sunday through thursday from 4 to 7 pm, and then a reverse happy hour from 10 pm to close), available in the bar area only.\n\n(pics posted, of course!)",

            "the restaurant had the usual las vegas markup, and the food didn't really wow.  however, the rolls were very <mark>Uni</mark> and different and the presentation of the food was done very well.  the combination of jap/peruvian/brazilian works pretty well together, though you can find better jap/peru/bra food at individual restaurants.  overall, it was a decent experience though i dont think i would go there again.", 
            "just like any fancy vegas joint, if you want to have a pretty good experience at the restaurant, expect to pay upwards of ~$45 per person.\n\ni would recommend making reservations as the place can get packed.\n\ni came with a group of about 8. the menu is extensive. you probably won't know what to get especially if it's your first time at this joint. our waiter, who was really nice and helpful, asked us how much we were willing to spend and he would take care of us.\n\ntake care of us he did. we were set up with a 6 course meal which included peruvian and japanese style cuisine. i can't remember everything (because there was a lot of variety), but there was lots of good stuff like sushi and steak. <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark> is tasty!\n\npresentation of food was perfect. they are quick with filling water and the plates and utensils are elegant and <mark>Uni</mark>. a few times during our meal, they replaced our plates with fresh ones.\n\nwe paid $45 each and we were all very satisfied because the meal was filling and not too much.\n\nthe service and the environment and professionalism they give you at the restaurant was well worth the money and i would definitely come back here.\n\nthe background music they would play was very samba. i was really diggin' it.\n\nthe bar area looked interesting. i would have sat down to have a few drinks if i wasn't too messed up for before.\n\nthe bathrooms were incredibly nice. however, i can only really speak for the men's room. it's like the urinals have their own big stall. you just have to see it. they have someone there asking if you would like some soap and after you're done washing your hands, they give you a really soft towel to wipe your hands on. nice!\n\nit's located in a nice place in some shopping area near a victoria's secret and a other stores. so if you're bored waiting for a table, you can shop around.", 
            "good sushi with a twist. they have some <mark>Uni</mark> flavors and rolls: bobo brazil, yamato (<mark>Foie Gras</mark>, caviar, toro) and a few others. <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> was pretty disappointing.\n\ncareful when ordering the kobe, it's $27 an ounce usually a 5oz minimum. my smart friend ordered 10oz's off the bat thinking it was only $27 total. i am not sure of the name, but the kobe cooked on a hot rock is delicious. worth $150 per order? just for the experience. \n\nif you could gamble $50 a hand on blackjack or pai gow, why not eat it as well?  \n\npros: <mark>Uni</mark> rolls and flavors\n\ncons: very pricey ($2 for wasabi haha), mediocre service both times i went",

            "we stayed at the venetian and palazzo over the weekend. it took us about an hour to decide on which restaurant in the palazzo to dine at....because man are the restaurants super pricey. since we had friends that had to catch a flight we had to eat in the palazzo so we decided on this place for a group of 9.\n\nthis place blends japanese, brazilian, and peruvian cuisine....while it sounds like a great idea (never heard of such an asian fusion combo)....i think this place tries way to hard to be different. the only thing that i really liked was the grilled <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>....super yummy but it still was $16 for two mini skewers. it came with <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark> which sounded interesting....but turned out to be huge corn kettles that tasted like buttered lima beans....yucko!!! as far as the sushi i tried about 5 of the 10 rolls they had. wasn't too impressed with any of them. they looked pretty and all....but weren't so yummy. i tried a few other dishes too....it just seemed like they were blending <mark>Uni</mark> flavors that just didn't blend well together. the few things preventing me from giving this place 2 stars was the great service (note: they do get 20% tip for groups.....so i do expect top quality service), cool ambiance, and hot guys. check out the break down below:\n\n2 stars - food (overall disappointing)....except for the<mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> \n2 stars - price (expect to pay $40 - $100 per person if you want to get full)\n2 stars - portions (i left still a bit hungry)\n4 stars - atmosphere\n5 stars - service (really friendly waitress)\n5 stars - hot workers!!! (seriously...do you have to be a model to work here....there was lots of eye candy dressed in all black)\n__________________________________\n\njust 3 stars all in all....overall don't really recommend it here if you are strapped on cash....ur probably better off at a buffet on the strip if you wanna get your money's worth. but if you have money to blow....this is a happening place.", 
            "i love sushi...many restaurants (especially asian ones) in vegas are expensive for unauthentic and <mark>Uni</mark> food-sushi samba is not one of them. \n\nthe sushi was amazing. who knew you could find fresh fish in the middle of a desert?? but the sashimi was heavenly-very fresh, melts in your mouth. the decor/ambiance is great. service was friendly and cocktails were strong and delicious.\n\ni was definitely impressed-check it out!", 
            "checked out sushi samba for lunch and was impressed. nice atmosphere, although they claim to play samba music and most of what i heard was definitely not samba (marvin gaye?). service was decent, although our server tended to recommend expensive dishes...don't know if those are the ones that are truly their specialties, if management tries to push those dishes, or if our server was just trying to upsell for a bigger tip. robata chicken skewer with <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark> was tasty, the tempura green beans with black truffle aioli were bomb, and the <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> rolls and pacific rolls were very good. i would have liked to see a little more prevalent south american influence, but it's still more <mark>Uni</mark> than your average trendy sushi joint and with good food at reasonable prices.", 
            "there are plenty of sushi restaurants to choose from in las vegas, but if you're in the mood for something <mark>Uni</mark> and different, try sushi samba.  it looks like a funky nightclub at first glance, but venture inside and you'll find a lively restaurant with an eclectic atmosphere and friendly service.  if you're looking for a quiet, romantic dinner, this probably isn't your place.\n\nstart out with a drink.  the sake list is long and distinguished, sure to satisfy even the most discerning sake drinker.  and if sake is not your thing, they have great signature drinks. try the yemenja (vodka, ginger liqueur, lemongrass and mint).\n\ntime to eat!  you'll discover the menu is just as eclectic as the ambience, fusing japanese, brazilian and peruvian cuisine.  if you want sushi, they have sushi.  or if you prefer brazilian bbq, they have churrasco.  but it's the smaller more distinct plates that make this place great.   the miso-glazed <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> skewers are a must, served with large kernel <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark>, they're \"melt in your mouth\" good.  also, the <mark>Samba Strip</mark> roll (lobster, mango, peanut curry) will knock your socks off.  one could return to this spot several times and still not try everything on the menu. in fact, i recommend bringing a large group of friends so that you can sample more of the many delights sushi samba has to offer.", 
            "i was pleasantly surprised by sushi samba.  it was kind of a last choice for our big bachelorette party of 18 girls.  at first i was like... eh, i can try that in ny.  and you're always taking a gamble with asian fusion.\n\nbut, we knew the bride liked sushi and so we eventually caved.\n\nhere is the breakdown of my experience at samba:\n\ndecor/atmosphere - dark, swank, very appropriate for the occasion.  they sat our party in the back room where no one else was seated.  that was nice.  we had privacy for the first hour or so of our meal.  the air conditioning was cranked up way too high but they said they turned it down.  i don't think they did.  i damn near lost my toes trying to keep blood flowing to the extremities.\n\nservice - friendly, cute staff of slow-talking brazilian boys.  they're good but something tells me they were hired as eye candy rather than for their perfect waiting skills.  as we sat down they asked if we wanted flat or sparkling water - don't you hate when restaurants do that and trick you into buying overpriced bottled water?  i specifically clarified \"tap\" after some of the girls said flat and they still brought out about 7 bottles all opened and ready to pretty much pour straight into our throats.  that was my one big complaint of the night.  oh yeah, and i also asked them to box up some leftovers for us to take, which they never did.\n\nfood - surprisingly yummy.  we had a 7-course pre-fixe which included a shrimp appetizer, organic greens salad with carrot-ginger dressing, giant sushi platter, miso <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>, teriyaki chicken over <mark>Purple Potato Mash</mark> potatoes, beef carpaccio(?), chocolate bread pudding and finally a tres leite (i have no idea what this is but it was delicious). the highlight for me was the <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>.  very similar to a miso black cod or butterfish.  i loved the chicken.  usually, i'm indifferent to teriyaki but it was moist and so <mark>Uni</mark> with the creamy potatoes.  the beef dish was like a beef tataki - very rare (almost raw) and with nice acidity.  desserts did not disappoint at all - i'd say it was actually a highlight of the meal.\n\nwell done, sushi samba.  you were way overpriced but i have to admit i enjoyed myself.", 
            "our waiter made a really good point that many people believe your restaurant is a <mark><mark>Osetra Caviar Imperial 20g</mark> 20g</mark> restaurant if you have sushi in the name. however, this place certainly did not disappoint.\n\nso this location is a mix of chilean, brazilian, and japanese tastes. it certainly was <mark>Uni</mark>. the environment is vibrant and alive. i felt that it really complimented their fusion style really well. they had flat screen tvs and projectors everywhere, showing pleasant scenery or <mark><mark>Osetra Caviar Imperial 20g</mark> 20g</mark>. i was just amazed by their design and color throughout the restaurant. their decor was also very compatible with their theme. the look was sharp and inviting at the same time.\n\nthe food was great. i tried the bobo brazil roll. i tried this because i wanted to experience their <mark>Uni</mark> tastes, and it certainly brought the restaurant's fusion tastes together. it had seared kobe beef and red onions on top of what i think was an avocado roll with kaiware, and some other ingredients. it cost $17; the taste was awesome, but we could not decide whether or not it was worth the full $17. other items we ordered included a <mark>Berkshire Pork Belly</mark> ramen, a ribeye bento box, and a terriyaki chicken bento box. these were generic dishes, but they turned out great.  \nthe restaurant serves dishes in appetizer or small portions. do not expect a large portion when ordering an entree. this restaurant is more for people who want to shell out a little bit of cash to enjoy something <mark>Uni</mark>. four of us ordered a total of 6 items and then mochi ice cream for desert. \n\nthe service was really on top of everything. our waiter knew the menu and was able to tell us what was in every item we asked, and told us what to expect from the restaurant's style of cooking. he came around periodically to make sure everything was okay, and just did a perfect job.\n\ni would definitely recommend people to try this place at least once. it is a little on the pricey end, but it is worth the quality of food that you receive.", 
            "came here for lunch a few weeks ago.  this place is nice inside and has good atmosphere.  price wise its high even for vegas standards.  food was good but, not great and not the best sushi i've had in vegas.\n\nservice was good but, not great.  like i said the atmosphere is great here and loved the inside of the place.  kind of dark inside though.\n\nthere was 3 of us for lunch.  we started out with tiger shrimp and japanese vegetables tempura, <mark>Seaweed Salad</mark>, and yellowtail.  ok starting with the tempura for 14.00 there was nothing here.  very <mark>Uni</mark> as this was not even enough to share with 2 people.  <mark>Seaweed Salad</mark> was not good at all.  we just had khotan two nights before and they had the best <mark>Seaweed Salad</mark> i've had yet.  anyways, hijiki, aka-tosaka, goma wakame, wakame, tomato caviar, lemon is what came in the <mark>Seaweed Salad</mark> it was very weak and lacked taste.   as, for the yellowtail it was very good and the sauce it came with was great.  most of my rating comes from this and this alone.  as for lunch itself i got the <mark>Samba Sushi</mark> chef's inspiration sushi assortments and it was good but, nothing great and for 26.00 it should be great.  anyways we split up everything and i paid for the tempura and sushi and it came to 51.02 for lunch with tip.\n\nthe place is nice and food was ok but, would skip for other sushi options on and off the strip.", 
            "went here twice on a recent foray in vegas - once for dinner at the bar and a second time just drinking at the bar.\n\nsushi-wise, the restaurant does a good job. their rolls are creative and beautifully presented. check out the <mark>Rainbow Dragon</mark>, as the use of red peppers offers a pretty un-<mark><mark>Osetra Caviar Imperial 20g</mark> 20g</mark> on japanese sushi rolls. it's definitely expensive to grab a meal here once you tack on drinks, but i would say it's worth it. don't come expecting traditional/formal sushi, although you can definitely get that if you come here. i would recommend being adventurous and getting something that is <mark>Uni</mark> to the restaurant. the portions aren't huge and while it's easy to complain about that, well, this ain't the wynn buffet people! consider it your opport<mark>Uni</mark> to splurge and try a plethora of dishes to widen your palate. or, since their kitchen is open well past midnight, stroll in later in the night for a post-gambling/show/club-hopping snack.\n\nsamba-wise, the ambiance fits the decor they're trying to promote - some sort of trendy and dark restaurant. if you want a quiet meal, don't come here (actually - why are you even in vegas??).\n\ndrink-wise, this place excels. the tequilana caliente is a tasty cocktail that packs a punch. the caipirinha uses high quality leblon cacha\\u00e7a. and if those two aren't good enough (or you're like me and you drink both cocktails and want a third), try the chu-cumber sochu - our bartender made this into a shot, which went down so smoothly even though it was basically all alcohol. the one downside that evening was that they were out of their plums for their bushido drink, a cocktail that has daikon in it too. i guess that means there's always something to come back to.",

            "thursday night. 9pm. \nour reservations were honored to the minute and the man who runs the show, mike durovsik, at once made us feel not just like welcomed guests but old friends.\n\nmy fiance and i were indulged with a 9 course specialized server's omakase. the food was superb, and the service exceeds even the best definitions of accommodating. \n\nour charming and attentive server asked immediately how adventurous we were willing to get, and since we had no objections to anything particular, our meal immediately commenced.\n\nfirst was the otsumami, three small dishes: <mark>Green Bean Tempura</mark> with a creamy truffle aoli dipping sauce (incredible), shishito peppers charcoal grilled and just the right amount of spicy, as well as edamame sprinkled with sea salt.\n\nnext came hamachi (yellowtail) tacos paired with a fizzing sort of vinegarette (spicy aji panca) on the side to top it off- this was filled with so much flavour it literally forced my eyes to roll back. a real treat that i'd highly  reccommend.\n\nat this point it was quite apparent that service and timing was top notch. the bottle of sake we brought was being chilled tableside and water never fell below the 2/3rds mark. as the bottle chilled we tasted two different cocktails-  kumori, a cucumber cocktail with shochu and nigori which was refreshing, easy, and delicious.  alongside was the ever popular nina fresa, a strawberry cocktail with vodka. both made for easy, yet yummy drinking.\n\ntheir mushroom toban yaki was divinely creamy- we got ours with bincho tan grilled lamb on top which paired quite nicely with those garlic chips. their were five different kinds of perfectly cooked mushrooms in the mix, and all around it made for a <mark>Uni</mark> filling appetizer. my fiances words: that fu**ing amazing lamb dish ;)\n\nthe sashimi tiradito i'm always raving about came next. still on a midblowing level, i noticed that their are different flavour notes (though served with the same ingredients) for the nyc location and the las vegas one. so if you think you've had it before, you haven't. though different, the fish is always immensely fresh and the taste accents are truly wonderful. my favorite is the kanpachi since i'm a sucker for yuzu (japanese citrus) and my fiance was a big fan of the hamachi- if you're torn, go with the assortment of all four and you won't have any regrets.\n\noff the robata grill (bincho tan charcoal) came the most decadant <mark><mark>Alaskan King Crab</mark> Leg</mark> imaginable- our taste buds were literally in shock from the mastermind talents of chef oscar toro. bedded atop rock salt, the crab was creamy, fell apart smoothly, and the flavours enhanced the entire piece of already fresh seafood. a seasonal dish that may not always be available... so wonderful. if they don't have it on menu, go for the spiny lobster.\n\nalso from from the robata grill we enjoyed the miso glazed <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> with baby corn. again, this dish can be done so many different ways at different high end japanese restaurants- but sushi samba's brazillian take really heightens the tastes.\n\nask for the freshest oysters of the day- you can go with <mark><mark>Osetra Caviar Imperial 20g</mark> 20g</mark>, paired with yuzu jelly and lemon, or a more contemporary take which chef oscar toro will create specially for that oyster.- both ways are unforgettable.\n\nmy absolute favorite dish is the kobe ishiyaki. you grill fresh pieces of perfectly marbleized kobe tableside 3-5 seconds on each side on an extremely hot river stone. you get 4-5 sauces and and array of salts to mix up the taste buds for you- absolutely the most decadently delicious dish. whenever i see this i must have it, and sushi samba's is the best i've had. not enough people indulge in this and you must must must!!! \n\nour sushi/sashimi platter was fresh and wonderful- exquisite. we got the <mark>Neo Tokyo</mark> and the <mark>El Topo</mark> rolls- <mark>Neo Tokyo</mark> has tuna and a bit of spicy to it, and the <mark>El Topo</mark> is served warm- a surprising aspect, but the melted mozzarella is such a <mark>Uni</mark> addition. it's like the movie \"<mark>El Topo</mark>\" you must try/ see both! \n\nfor dessert we went with mochi; a soft and chewy japanese dessert that is <mark><mark>Osetra Caviar Imperial 20g</mark> 20g</mark> not overly sweet. sushi samba adds ice cream to the center and offers all the best flavours. \n\nby the end of our meal and a finished bottle of sake, we were both more than pleasantly buzzed and satiated with an incredible meal. \n\n\n**************\nbottom line, if you are trying to decide between nobu and sushi samba, pass on nobu and put some samba in your seafood!!\n\nthank you again mike and oscar for such a wonderful night!!", 
            "sushi samba puts an excellent spin on <mark><mark>Osetra Caviar Imperial 20g</mark> 20g</mark>.  the fusion of japanese and south american flavors are a perfect combination.  since i like my food on the spicy side, i found that sushi samba adds that flare to usually very neutral sushi.  \n\nthe one dish i found to be my favorite of the visit was the hamachi (yellowtail) sashimi tiradito.  hamachi is always a great choice for its oil content, but along with the spicy/tangy sauce it is served on is a more than suitable replacement for shoyu.  i also tried the yamato roll, which is sushi with maguro and  <mark>Foie Gras</mark>, a great and <mark>Uni</mark> flavor.  one disappointment i found was the kobe beef sushi.  i would rather have had otoro.  one last recommendation, don't order collard greens at a sushi place.  it was decent although it was no southern style collard greens that i prefer.  \n\ni will definitely go back to sushi samba the next time i am in vegas.  there are so many things on the menu that i still want to try!", 
            "happy hour  = $6 mojitos, capirinhas, and select food.\n\nwe ordered a few dishes for happy hour here and found some hit and miss. the wonderful ceviche with came topped with a fabulous salad. the salad dressing was heavenly: light sesame oil and just a hint of spice. the crunchiness of the salad balanced well with the slightly cooked fish.\n\nbesides the ceviche, the other dishes were not very <mark>Uni</mark>. the sushi was <mark>Uni</mark> and the squid was okay. everything presented well.\n\ntry: ceviche (they have several kinds)\nskip: sushi", 
            "amazing and <mark>Uni</mark> peruvian + japanese + brazilian combination!  the location is beautiful, we had a few pisco sours and a caipirinha (yum!) at the bar to start and then moved inside for our dinner reservation.  we are all peruvian and love sushi so this combination totally hit the spot!!!  all of the food was delicious, and i especially enjoyed the green envy roll with aji amarillo and <mark>Neo Tokyo</mark> roll with aji panca.\n\nwe got:\nyellowtail tiradito\nyellowtail ceviche\nbeef anticuchos (with <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark>)\n<mark>Neo Tokyo</mark> roll (yellowfin tuna, tempura flake, aji panca)\n<mark>El Topo</mark> roll (salmon, jalape\\u00f1o, shiso leaf, fresh melted mozzarella, crispy onion, sounds like a weird combo but we loved it!)\ngreen envy roll (tuna, salmon, asparagus, wasabi pea crust, aji amarillo-key lime mayo)\n\n-1 star for $$$",

            "my opinion/side note - i dont think its their sushi that makes this a good place to eat. but its the dishes that are not other sushi restaurant menus that makes it worth the cost.\n\nthis place is really good, only if you order the right things, because ordering something bad can cost you a pretty penny. i have been here twice and the 2nd time was much better because we all knew what we liked. \n\nthe chilean <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> on the robata grill section was probably my favorite rendition of chilean <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>. our waiter said the robata grill costs $1000 a day to operate? something like that. but wow it was good. you have to order off of this part of the menu if you are a fan of grilled food.\nprobably the only time i felt like a winner in vegas all weekend, just playing, kinda, lol.\n\nthe yellowfin taquitos were so <mark>Uni</mark>, and the foam chili sauce that came with it was the perfect compliment.\n\n<mark>El Topo</mark> - good but not great. table loved it though.\n\n<mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark> with black truffle aoili - if i ever make my dream of opening up a restaurant come true - this will be the first item on the menu. wowwww. it made a shrimp convert out of 1 the people at our table. but really how can u not like shrimp?\n\n\n-p", 
            "overview: \n\ngood food, terrible service and incredibly overpriced even by vegas standards.  this is one to avoid unless you're really desperate for expensive sushi and/or p<mark>Uni</mark> omasake.\n\nfood:\n\nthe food was good.  sushi samba offers a <mark>Uni</mark> but odd blend of japanese and brazillian cooking.  the menu explains that there are japanese people who live in brazil but that doesn't explain how sushi and mashed purple potatoes go together.  \n\nmy wife and i wanted to order eel.  on the menu it said $6 for eel.   at most sushi places an order would be two pieces.  at ss an order is one piece.  i've eaten at some very high end sushi places, none would dare charge this much for eel.  the rest of the fish was similarly overpriced.  rolls with four pieces were hitting $20, it was crazy.\n\nthat said, the eel was pretty good as was everything else i ate.  the oyster,  was good but cost the almost the same as the eel ($4 each).  my main course was a well cooked piece of chicken with an excellent <mark>Purple Potato Mash</mark>.  i tried several other dishes and it was the only one i'd think of ordering again.\n\none veggie friend opted for the omasake and ended up leaving as hungry as he arrived.\n\nservice:\n\nthe service was unbelievably bad on every single level.  our server was nowhere to be found, we literally had to beg her to come back to our table and take our money.  the food came out at a pace unseen before.  some items took over an hour to make.  things like fish, which probably cooked for only five minutes.  sushi took almost as long, even the simple to make stuff.  the waitress came by to explain that things would come out as they're ready because they have three kitchens.  come to think of it, she said that to us at least six times.  maybe they should have one kitchen that functions properly.\n\nat this snails pace the waitress still managed to screw things up, ordering me the most expensive oysters when in fact i had ordered another kind.\n\nall this pales in comparison to my friend who said he was a vegetarian and, at the pleading of the waitress, agreed to \"trust her\" and let her select things he'd eat.  he wasn't a vegan, but a vegetarian.  he ended up with a large plate of vegetables covered in teriaki sauce.  that was his dinner.  how pathetic. \n\natmosphere:\n\nthis place gave me a headache.  there were odd silent film strips running on the walls, insane colors all over the place and the typical loud vegas roar in the background.  of course there are few color palates i can stomach for that length of time.\n\nvalue:\n\nthis place was the worst value of any place i ate on my trip.  i spent $125 for two people and left feeling hungry.  high end sushi places rarely charge the prices this place charges and considering this was a step above \"rock n' roll sushi\" they have no right to be charging these amounts for what are basic items.  \n\nthe friend who ended up with the plate of vegetables still had a $40 bill for himself.", 
            "i really like this place! we were tired from walking around and shopping, and craved a light snack. a lot of things were really heavy, so we decided that sushi was a safe bet. not knowing anything about that place, we went there sort of on a limb.\n\ni went there on a quiet day at an unconventional time (prob around 3pm), so it wasn't bustling with people and loud chattering. there were probably at most about 5 other tables that were occupied with diners. it's dim-lit and all the interior designing seemed to fit a sort of cool, mellow, and dark color scheme. very relaxing..\n\nour waitress was a very nice girl. she was knowledgeable, very attentive, and very sweet. she was working during the holidays, and if she hated every second of it...well, we really couldn't tell. i asked her for suggestions on rolls, and her suggestions were great.\n\nalthough their sushi rolls aren't exactly traditional, they were really <mark>Uni</mark>. flavorful, but light. just what we were looking for! i got a non<mark><mark>Osetra Caviar Imperial 20g</mark> 20g</mark> that was wrapped in a sort of pink-ish rice paper rather than seaweed, and i just felt so healthy and nice eating it. what a relief from eating something something so refreshing! one pleasant little perk was that when i asked for green tea, we had the option to have it iced or hot. maybe i'm biased because i was tired from walking around all day, but man. that iced unsweetened green tea was so perfect.\n\nas for the price, i reviewed the menu and realized that yes, it's a little expensive, but what else could you expect for vegas? i guess it's motivation for you to go back out there and win your avocado rolls worth back!", 
            "this is definitely one of the best restaurants i've been to in las vegas.  the decor is amazing, the atmosphere is fun and exciting, the service is impeccable and the food is fabulous.  after seeing a show in the venetian, we were looking for something light to eat - nothing heavy.  sushi samba filled the bill perfectly.   the items that our very knowledgeable and extremely attentive server selected for us were amazing - some cooked, some raw, some were rolls, some were not.  i have to say, honestly, that we loved absolutely everything we ate.  the idea of everything being brought out and shared between us was <mark>Uni</mark> and really fun.  we got to try so many delicious dishes by sharing small plates.  the drinks were spectacular as well.  and to top it off, one of the managers came by our table and asked us if we were having a good time, how the meal was, and told us to let him know if we needed anything because it was his job to make sure our visit to sushi samba was an incredible experience.  all i can say is that it was more than an incredible experience - it was the best.  we can't wait to go back when we return to las vegas.",

            "if your large party is looking for a restaurant where you walk in hungry and leave just as hungry and unsatisfied while you were just taken for a crazy price...by all means - this sushi/ brazilian restaurant is for you! \n\nso their \"concept\" for a group of 8 guests....a waitress brings one menu for everyone at the table. (apparently there is a ration on menus at this restaurant). she happily tells you that you give her an \"idea\" of what you like and then she will decide what to bring to your table based off of what you tell her - the prices for this \"family\" style of ordering started at $50 per person and went up from there - not including alcohol or dessert. wth??? oh, but you don't have to pay for something if you don't like it......supposably. \n\nas she brings these tiny portions out to our table for us to fight over, we soon realize that no one is really getting what they wanted and no one is satisfied with what she is serving us. some liked certain items, but honestly, the bowls of white rice was the most filling thing we ate. even the black beans were terribly under seasoned - how can anyone screw up black beans?? \n\nremember the \"if you don't like what she brings out, you don't need to pay for it\" rule? well, the minute you complain about not liking something, the waitress gives attitude and acts frustrated at your lack of ability to comm<mark>Uni</mark> what you want her to bring you.... when most of the table did not get a chance to even see the menu in the first place. \n\nafter a meal that felt like we just ate at an ethiopian restaurant and still hungry, we chanced ordering a \"large plate\" dessert and some other people at our table ordered a \"small plate\" dessert. when the desserts come, our dessert was a very small piece of cake on a very large saucer plate.....and the our friends who ordered the small dessert was larger than our dessert, but on a small plate....so they didn't technically lie about the size of the plates, but lets just say they really need to rethink their menu and overall concept. \n\nultimately, we left the restaurant $75 each lighter in our wallets -( as the tip was already added for the crappy service we did get.)  and feeling like we should have all gotten a jar or lube on our way in as we all felt assaulted at the end of our meal.\n\nif i could have given a lower score, i would have! sushi samba is a huge ripoff with crappy service and an even crappier concept. the one positive is the interior design of the restaurant was creative, which is the only thing positive i can say about ti, sadly.",

            "my favorite thing about this restaurant is the option of having a \"custom menu.\" for a flat per person fee, you can ask your waiter (ours was max, who was incredibly attentive and friendly) to order your food for you. as a restaurant with three kitchens (japanese, brazillian & peruvian, don't quote me on that last one), the diversity of dishes you can consume is great. \n\nevery time a dish was brought out for us, max would sit down for a couple seconds and explain each dish. it was really fun not knowing what came out next! for about $70/person (with tip) we got:\n\ndumplings and ceviche\nfour types of sashimi\n<mark>Peruvian Corn</mark> & grilled miso <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>\nalbacore tuna roll & <mark>El Topo</mark> roll\nbraised <mark>Duck Breast</mark> with japanese mushrooms\n\nall of which were amazing. do the \"custom menu.\" it's what makes this place <mark>Uni</mark> and fun!", 
            "if you want to try some sushi that's prepared with a delightful spin then this place is perfect for you. the atmosphere resembles a club more than a high class restaurant.  it's filled with fast-paced dance music and most of the guests are dressed like they are ready for the club after dinner. \n\nthe defining feature of the restaurant comes from its mixture of japanese and brazilian cuisine. our server recommended the seviches and tiraditos; since we couldn't decide which one to get we ordered both! seviches are sashimi served in a fruit/salsa. we had tiger shrimp in a mango salsa and tuna with grapefruit and jalapenos. the sashimi was super fresh and i loved the fruit/salsa combo.  it was sweet and refreshing. tiraditos are sashimi immersed in a tangy sauce, probability the only dish i wasn't too fond of though.  the sauce was too sour and it overwhelmed the fish. \n\nif eating an endangered animal does not affect your conscience i would highly recommend the chilean <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> skewers. the fish was amazing, the meat practically flakes off on its own and the unagi sauce was so umami! \n\ni saved the best for last. imagine eating all of the finest food: <mark>Foie Gras</mark>, <mark><mark>Osetra Caviar Imperial 20g</mark> 20g</mark> gold?!?! all in one bite. hurry to sushisamba and order the yamato roll.  at first the combination of those above ingredient wrapped in a tuna roll may seem excessive, but it absolutely worked.  it is the best roll i ever had.  the <mark><mark>Osetra Caviar Imperial 20g</mark> 20g</mark> gold were subtle, but the <mark>Foie Gras</mark>, infused its smoky buttery flavor to an otherwise ordinary but fresh tuna roll, made it special. i would like to add, the <mark>Foie Gras</mark> was one of the finest i have ever eaten and it came from a sushi restaurant.\n\ntry sushisamba if you are in vegas to get a delectable and <mark>Uni</mark> sushi experience.", 
            "best sushi place in town.  the rolls are fresh and <mark>Uni</mark>.  the environment is pretty cool.  only one issue... the music is always too loud.", 
            "their signature roll saved them from a 2 star review.  reading the reviews and consistency of solid reviews, i thought i found the spot!  once there, the overpriced menu and sake list reminded me i was in vegas, a place that should not have to be this expensive, i mean come on, people are handing money hand over fist at the tables, don't gouge us at the restaurants.  nigiri was priced per piece at a rate higher than i'm used to paying for 2 pieces.  the rolls were decent, i liked the <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> version they served, a little <mark>Uni</mark>, the eel avocado was good.  my main complaint is that they are a decent sushi spot, nothing extraordinary, and their prices are simply too high.  however, the samba roll, with <mark>Half Maine Lobster</mark>, mango and some other delightful flavors that created a party on my palate, bumped them to 3 stars.  great roll, $19, but that one was special.", 
            "went for my first time with a group of 7 and was blown away at the service, ambiance and not to mention the food was ah-mazing. i've been to a lot of top notch sushi restaurants, and this was probably the most <mark>Uni</mark> concept with japanese/brazilian/peruvian inspired dishes. \n\nwith a group of 7 with a variety of tastes, likes and dislikes, one of the best things sushi samba does is offer a chef's selection of 3 or 4 courses based on (a) how much each person wants to spend (we chose $40/person) and (b) what each person likes, dislikes, is allergic to, etc. and (c) how many courses (we did 3).\n\nwe didn't know what to expect, but the first course/starters came out and there was a piece of each starter for each person (don't you hate when there is an odd number?!) and the girl who likes chicken over fish got a steak skewer instead of raw tuna. the second course included this fabulous peruvian grilled and butter sauteed corn that i am seriously in love with. each kernel is the size of your index fingernail, sweet and lightly grilled for a slight chewy texture. where can i find this at my local grocer or farmers market?! the third course included a variety of sushi including non-fish, non-raw rolls for the non-fish eaters in our group. \n\nwe were a hungry bunch and left very happy. bring your appetite because the portions are nice. service was 5 stars with attentive staff start to finish. our server came by regularly to check-in, the staff orchestrated plate and settings changes after each course, and we even got a complimentary strawberry vodka drink on the house.", 
            "it's not that i hated this place, but i was very <mark>Uni</mark> with the quality of the sushi here.  although we only ordered four rolls (we were only in for a snack), none of the rolls knocked my socks off.  i guess when i'm in vegas i have the unrealistic expectation that every restaurant is going to have amazing food, and this place just reiterated that it isn't possible.", 
            "food was very good and <mark>Uni</mark>.  yellowtail taquitos, sepia robata and <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark> were distinct highlights.  ambiance and service left something to be desired, though.  the room, while interesting was very noisy with tables right on top of each other making discreet conversation a chore.  the waitress didn't bother explaining the menu or offering suggestions other than a quick listing of specials.  despite ordering at least 6 dishes, all the food arrived at the same time.  so much for pacing the meal!\n\nwe were done our dinner in 40 minutes and feeling rushed by the staff were eager to leave.  would return for lunch or appetizers but nt again for a leisurely meal.", 
            "my friends and i were strolling through the palazzo last evening looking for some good eats.  we were pulled in by stunning smells illuminating from sushi samba's cozy corner restaurant.  service from the start was top notch.  we decided to sit bar-side.  the sous chef, robert, came out and gave us a personal welcome for our first visit; followed by a generous on-the-house appetizer.  sea scallop with pesto magic.  one bite was packed full of a fresh, balanced flavor that took my taste buds to a place they haven't been in many years.  after one bite, i knew we had come to the right place.\n\non recommendation from the chef - we ordered <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> with veggies and a sweet miso drizzle.  now to me, <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> if very rarely billed as a \"main course\" but wow - this dish was spectacular.  a must try for any fan of the sea.  the cocktails are inventive, <mark>Uni</mark> and balanced.  try one of their special sake martini's - tastes like you've never had before.  \n\nsushi samba is the real deal.  they made it perfectly clear that the restaurant intends to better serve their customers and grow it's gourmet creations .  all of their products are the pinnacle of fresh.  no doubt restocked daily.  the presentation of everything from drinks to dinner was carefully crafted with intention and purpose.  quick service and an aim-to-please attitude top to bottom made us feel more like we were clients than customers.\n\nwe ended the night with a round of delicious fruit sake cocktails and a heart-felt thank you to allen, the manager on duty.  in my opinion, the pricing is quite appropriate given the freshness, quality, service and atmosphere.  they nailed it, bravo!\n\nso if you're a fan of fine dinning, service, sushi or delicious cocktails - i highly recommend you make plans to visit sushi samba. \n\nthanks for the incredible evening sushi samba, i'll be back soon!", 
            "this place is astounding- one of the best meals i've had. the cocktails were fresh and summery. items from the robata grill, both veggies and beef/<mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>, were tender and flavorful. they served us an amazing mushroom dish with coconut milk and a mix of <mark>Uni</mark> mushrooms- a real treat for the vegetarians at the table- and those of us who aren't too. taquitos with lump grab meat, tempura veggies.... and a dessert platter with very memorable mochi and little dessert cups that included flakes of gold! it doesn't get any better than this.\n\nthe atmosphere is dark and hip, reflecting the sabor of peru, brazil, and japan- a super innovative and successful fusion of the three countries. having been to brazil twice, i liked that they projected video on the walls from rio de janeiro- made me nostalgic about my visits!  \n\na classic upscale, trendy vegas dining experience- and a fun reminder of the exciting common ground between various world cuisines. will definitely return!", 
            "long overdue review.\n\ni really was disappointed because my mom's side of the family are asian immigrants to brazil who had lived in south america for decades. i really thought this was going to be brazilian style sushi, but it wasn't. a lot of people don't know this, but brazil has the 3rd largest population of asians outside of asia.  1st being the usa, 2nd being canada, and 3rd being brazil.  did you also know that brazil has more japanese residents than the <mark>Uni</mark> states? so, i was very excited that a place like this opened up. \n\ni am a big fan of \"fusion sushi\".  i love new and creative twists on the oldschool style maki, but sushisamba just doesn't do it as well as other sushi restaurants. sushi is really really popular in brazil.  and unlike americans, the brazilian sushi houses tend to be very traditional. that means that they don't really like california rolls or other types of fusion sushi that is popular in america.  but, the menu here is more similar to ichiro mashita's american style sushi. \n\nsushisamba prides themselves on having \"fresh fish\", that is of higher quality than smaller sushi restaurants and that is their justification for charging higher prices. but, even places like sushi bomb(north west), sushi on rainbow(koreatown), sushi twister(boulder highway) and even the overrated goyemon(southwest) have fresh fish flown in everyday, and some of these places even keep the fish alive in tanks until the day of serving. and they only charge a fraction of what this place does. you know, even the edomaezushi style kabuto restaurant's prices are lower than this place.  \n\ni guess i'm just really upset over the fact that they hyped this place up as a brazilian-japanese style restaurant and it wasn't any of that. it wasn't brazilian cuisine and it really wasn't authentic japanese cuisine. and, i just recently found out that the owner of this place is a guy named matthew johnson. that doesn't sound brazilian or japanese to me. \n\nyou know how a lot of full-blooded japanese yelpers always complain about how they hate sushi bars that are owned and operated by non-japanese asians and have latino cooks? yet, this place is owned by a white man from new york city and we don't find those same japanese yelpers complaining? why is that? someone explain that to me? where is alex s and hootie b??", 
            "sushisamba provides an interesting mix of japanese, brazilian, and peruvian flavors.  the interior is dimly lit and contemporary; a very attractive dining space.\n\ni was with a large party, and our server put together a tasting menu that was within our desired price range and provided a diverse portrait of the cuisine the restaurant offers.  the service was excellent, and dealt with our group very well.  there was one drink order that seemed to have been forgotten, but these errors can happen.  when it was brought to the server's attention, it was dealt with promptly and apogetically.  \n\nour meal consisted of about ten small-plates, portioned for sharing among the table.  while every dish was enjoyable, there were definite highlights.  my personal favorites were the yellowtail ceviche taquitos, and a decadent sushi roll that was topped with <mark>Foie Gras</mark>, <mark>Berkshire Pork Belly</mark>, and gold leaf.  \n\nthe accomodating service and <mark>Uni</mark> culinary influences of sushisamba make for a brilliant dining experience.", 
            "it's what you'd expect from a sushi restaurant that is in one of the nicer hotels on the strip.  the quality of the fish was good and the rolls were above average.  the difficulty i found was that the meal wasn't very memorable.  although the roll selection was very <mark>Uni</mark>, nothing stood out as a 'wow, i'll remember this roll forever' type of experience.  \n\nfor the price, it wasn't as good as it should have been.\n\nadditionally, the service was lackluster.  the sushi came out super fast after we ordered, which is troubling considering it took 10 minutes just for the waiter to take our drink orders and then another 15 before the manager realized our order hadn't been taken yet.\n\noverall a decent meal that was expensive and not very memorable.", 
            "interesting japanese, brazilian and peruvian fusion. the interior was really <mark>Uni</mark> which added to the ambience. \n\ni've never had a caipirinha before but i was pleasantly surprised. sort of like a brazilian mojito but much stronger here. \n\nthe <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> skewers were delicious and the corn looked like huge mutant corn and was sweet. \n\nthe <mark>Berkshire Pork Belly</mark> ramen tasted like sweet and sour soup but instead of the sour, it was spicy. the <mark>Berkshire Pork Belly</mark> itself was a little tough. though, that didn't mean it wasn't good.", 
            "while my better half was making moolah at the poker table, i needed to escape the ding-ding-ding sounds of the casino and decided to grab some happy hour. a short walk from the encore, sushisamba seemed to fit my need for some discounted booze and appetizers. \n\ntheir long oval bar by the main entrance was pretty much empty, so i easily settled into a spot and perused their happy hour offerings. they offered three different whiskey cocktail concoctions for $6. not being a huge whiskey fan, i picked the one that sounded the least rough to me. it was actually pretty decent, although i could have used a little more cocktail and a lot less ice. \n\ni picked three appetizers, an amount that is generally plenty at most happy hours to fill me up to the brim. the shrimp & chorizo skewers (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ph0blkl4cbxkzu471vznua?select=rdjuwvrioa0mxgtmilq7ha#rdjuwvrioa0mxgtmilq7ha) were my favorite. the shrimp was barely cooked through with nice char marks and the chorizo had great flavors. the chimichurri-like sauce on top was great. i could have eaten a lot more of these. the sliced ahi tuna (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ph0blkl4cbxkzu471vznua?select=rdjuwvrioa0mxgtmilq7ha#-amdctlnjwrfnmkpbpgf0a) consisted of two very thin pieces of ahi drowned  in a soy-mustard sauce and topped with a halved cherry tomato and some leaves. this portion was super tiny and made me wonder whether happy hour at this place meant you get a quarter of the portion for half the price of the regular appetizer dish... i got the same feeling with the shredded pork mini tacos (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ph0blkl4cbxkzu471vznua?select=rdjuwvrioa0mxgtmilq7ha#i30qdbtwzsj2f8tnbjkqlq). one bite and those suckers were gone. the spicy sauce on the side served in a shot glass looked cool, but it was so frickin' hot (the bartenders thoroughly warned me) that you could only use a mini droplet on each taco. so what was the point of serving that much sauce? again, the portion size was disappointing and the taco was just average. \n\ntwo drinks & three appetizers = $37 (including tip). i left hungry and <mark>Uni</mark>. for around $40 i can usually eat and drink myself into stupidity at happy hour. sheesh, i could have had a great entree and a nice glass of wine at many of vegas' amazing restaurants instead. oh well, sushisamba is overpriced for its portions and the dishes were nothing mind blowing. don't think i'll be back here anytime soon.", 
            "i flipping love sushisamba. i've been here 3 times and it's just been incredible. this most recent trip, we were a group of 9 girls for a bachelorette party. we had lucked out by getting reservations the day of and they didn't make us wait. i thought they seated us in a weird spot...but no, our reservations were just so early, the place wasn't that full, but the table ended up being fine.\n\nwe decided to do the omakase style for around $50/person. they brought out the cocktail tree with 9 glasses of the samba juice which was incredible and such a great way for them to start wooing us, haha. \n- first course: fried green beans with truffle aioli (my fave!), grilled jalepenos (big hit!), and edamame.\n- second course: fish tacquitos (loved the shell, very crispy), a mushroom tacquito & large salad for the vegetarian, and pork pot stickers (good not great). \n- third course: the famed chilean <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> skewers (melt.in.your.mouth), <mark>Scallop</mark> with like a chimichurri sauce (delicious), and the <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark> (so <mark>Uni</mark>). \n- fourth course: meat/mushroom coconut milk \"curry\" (i hate coconut milk, and this was the one dish that we didn't make a considerable dent in...and they don't serve rice with this! weird).\n- fifth course: sushi. there were 3 different fish sushi rolls (salmon, tuna, and something else) and then 3 vegetarian (avocado, cucumber, and sweet potato--sweet potato was my fave!). they then brought out the dessert for my friend, which was comp'd which was nice.\n\nin my opinion, i felt like the chef prepared way too many fish dishes for this particular group because we had a vegetarian, we had someone who was allergic to shellfish, and we had 3 people who didn't like fish...and yet, we got a lot of fish. i think a lot of people go to sushisamba and expect sushi...but it's fushion, it's not <mark><mark>Osetra Caviar Imperial 20g</mark> 20g</mark>. i would definitely recommend doing the omakase style to start out--you can do it for $30-$75 per person and it's really fun. i rate it 4 stars because i think they should be more creative for vegetarians--vegetarians eat more than mushrooms :) but the service is great and the food is amazing. definitely one of my most consistent favorite places in vegas.",

            "what a fabulous meal!\n\nfirst some background.  we were a group of six new yorkers in vegas for a guys weekend of college basketball and good food.  all of us are regularly eating out in relatively expensive restaurants and love a good meal, consisting of both food and service. \n\nhaving had an absolutely miserable experience the night before at gordon ramsey's steakhouse in the paris hotel, we were really looking forward to a nice evening and these guys really delivered.\n\nwe were seated promptly and when the waiter came over and suggested that we could order from the menu or if we preferred we could give him a budget and he would serve us a meal.  we asked for a suggestion and he said that we'd really enjoy our meal at $65-70/person unless we wanted to also have a kobe beef course in which case we should figure closer to $100.  having had steaks the night before we gave him a free hand at $65-70.\n\ncourse after course of creative imaginative wonderful foods arrived, each one better than the one before. the final course was more <mark><mark>Osetra Caviar Imperial 20g</mark> 20g</mark> with several creative rolls and as a few of us eat a top ny sushi restaurants regularly, we were more than pleased.\n\nby the way, the amount of food server was just right, enough to be satisfied but not stuffed.\n.\nservice was terrific all night and for about $125/man including a approximately a 25% tip and tax (we only had one round of drinks) we left planning to re<mark>Uni</mark> in their ny location in a few weeks.",

            "located in the shoppes at palazzo casino. my original plan was to get some comps redeemed for grand lux cafe (which is a great place as well). to my surprise, i had over 100 bucks available...i don't remember playing in the venetian poker room that much, but oh well. a bigger surprise, they had a long list of places i could use comps at, including steakhouses, and here. this is not the norm for vegas poker rooms. i guess this could be a venetian poker room review as well; they treat their customers very well! so i decided to try this place. \n\ni'm very glad that i did! my waitress isabella was very attentive, thorough, and answered any questions i had. top notch service! the rest of the waitstaff was even friendlier. my table was periodically kept clean, and lots of refills kept coming. \n\ni was expecting to eat regular sushi, maybe a tasting menu. and i never really thought of what the samba part meant. but i looked at the menu and there were lots of options available, fusion-style: from brazilian steaks to <mark><mark>Osetra Caviar Imperial 20g</mark> 20g</mark> rolls. i was in for an unexpected and different, yet very satisfying meal. \n\n-samba tea: this is a must try! i forgot what they were, but they included many different types of ingredients; the result being one of my favorite teas, if not my favorite. \n-bobo brazil samba roll: <mark>Seared W<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> Beef</mark>, brazilian-japanese style...something new and amazing!\n-miso-marinated chilean <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>...so good! one of the best fish i've ever had.\n-20oz <mark>Bone in Ribeye</mark> steak: juicy and delicious. loved the flavor! goes very well with the sushisamba dipping sauces. \n-warm chocolate banana cake (maple butter, banana chip, vanilla rum ice cream)...awesome!\n\nservice: 5/5; food: 5/5!\n\nthis was a <mark>Uni</mark> and awesome dining experience for me. and it looks like there's plenty more to try! thanks sushisamba. i would definitely come back!",

            "an excellent fusion of japanese, brazilian, and peruvian.  what i found different about this establishment compared to others is the approach of ordering from their menu.  our waiter asked us for a price range we're willing to spend.  an example range is $60-$120.  my brother (who's birthday we're celebrating) said about $80 per person.  next, the waiter asks us what our likes, dislikes, allergies, etc in order to create a <mark>Uni</mark> dining experience for us.  my brother basically said he doesn't want to eat sushi (he didn't feel like it that day), wants to try the gyoza, and definitely want to sample the kobe beef.  after our drinks arrived, we waited about 10-20 minutes before our appetizers and entrees came.\n\nwe tried a variety of food which ranged from gyozas, skewers, <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>, and kobe beef.  the main attraction is the kobe beef where they bring a large stone that's heated to 700 f for us to cook our thinly sliced beef on.  the waiter demonstrated by taking some butter and spreading it on top of the stone followed by laying the beef on top like it's sunbathing.  after a minute or two, the beef slices were dipped onto 1 of 3 sauces and finally onto our table.  the verdict: mouth watering bliss.  almost as good as the kobe beef i had in kobe, japan!!!\n\nthe last attraction is the birthday dessert given to my brother.  the candles were sparkling similar to the morning glory fireworks that kids hold in their hands.  truly a memorable experience.",

            "what a way to celebrate my 21st birthday. after this experience i can only hope to have the opport<mark>Uni</mark> to come back year after year to celebrate just as perfectly.\n\nnot only was the food and drink world-class, the service and attention was deserving of 5 stars alone and both the servers and manager truly made this a special and memorable meal and experience.\n\nwe had 6:30 reservations but we arrived and were seated about 15 minutes early no questions asked and the night took off from there. \n\ni started the night with a brisa caliente cocktail: a conservatively spicy blend of tequila, ginger, fruit juices and chili in a rimmed glass with a shimchimi, a deliciously spicy japanese chili. although only a few days into the legal realm, i think i'll have a favorite drink for a long time coming.\n\nmy father and i split a number of dishes, including:\nspicy tempura rock shrimp: incredible array of flavors and textures. i've had similar dishes from local japanese fusion places and nobu and sushisamba's by far surpassed the competition. priced a little less with a more substantial portion, i could have been okay ordering a few of these.\n\nyellowtail and w<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> \"taquitos\": taquitos in the sense these two-a-piece small dishes were served in a mini crispy wonton-taco, the spicy aji panca sauce was drinkable by itself but added a level of sophistication that totally elevated the dish. i prefered the yellowtail over the w<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> mainly as the flavor of the fish was able to shine more than the beef. that said the beef was still really, really good.\n\n<mark>Broiled Peruvian Bay Scallop</mark>: served on the shell, these reminded me of a \"<mark>Scallop</mark> rockefeller\" of sorts, and the lime-butter crust was crispy and buttery. i'm glad they were <mark>Broiled Peruvian Bay Scallop</mark> versus their larger, more flavorful cousin since the crust was overpowering but as a single bite it was great.\n\nmiso chilean <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>: my favorite of the night, the two-skewer dish is completely melt-in-your-mouth with a perfect salty-sweet sauce. definitely the best non-<mark><mark>Osetra Caviar Imperial 20g</mark> 20g</mark> i've ever had. may be a little pricey but the flavor is just really, really good. this came with the <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark> which is now my all-time favorite vegetable...large kernels with a crazy good flavor.\n\n<mark>Sao Paulo</mark> samba roll: we were tempted by the gluttony of this everything-but-the-kitchen-sink roll and it was pretty awesome. it was a little much in the sense it's hard to differentiate everything inside, but the sauce on the side added an indescribable flavor that made it special. the roll comes with scallop, masago, red onion, tuna, salmon, shrimp, yellowtail, avocado, truffle, hacho miso soy, chive oil. wow.\n\n\"chef's inspiration\" sashimi platter: i'm a sucker for really good fish. that means i can be pretty picky, too. the platter came with 9 pieces, 3 each of sake salmon, akami tuna and yellowtail tuna. salmon included, the fish were so fatty (in the good way) and melt-on-the-toungue my father and i both were just blown away by the quality of raw fish from a restaurant which fuses japanese, brazilian and peruvian alike. \n\nraspberry sorbet w/ green tea coating: not sure what we were getting ourselves into with this, but the sweet white chocolate (?) and green tea ganache/candy-like coating paired with the super smooth and perfectly-sweet sorbet was the perfect end...and i don't generally choose fruit desserts.\n\n--\nall in all, i really cannot find any flaw in this place. i could only guess fewer-star ratings are attributed to a bad day or something because sushisamba has easily entered its way into my top 5 restaurants of all time...not an easy task. again i experienced wonderfully attentive service, great food, amazing cocktails and ended the night full and happy. not much more i could have asked for. thanks for an awesome birthday!", 
            "co-workers and i went for sushi one evening after work, and it was the best sushi i've ever had- an incredible experience. the service was outstanding, the food was a great mix of <mark><mark>Osetra Caviar Imperial 20g</mark> 20g</mark> <mark>Uni</mark> asian fusion. i recommend the <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>- the best i've ever had!",

            "i'm always a little skeptical of asian fusion cuisine, but this place does it right! our waitress was very helpful in guiding us through the menu, pointing out the more popular items. it is a \"tapas\" style menu, the plates are small and meant to be shared! we ordered: \n\n-<mark>Seared W<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> Beef</mark> gyoza: i think this was the best thing we ordered! the beef was soooo good and i loved the sauces on the side. \n\n-<mark>Berkshire Pork Belly</mark> ramen: everything in the ramen was very traditional, but the broth was very different from your typical bowl. it had a hint of lemongrass and some heat, which my boyfriend and i really liked (it kind of reminded us of tom yum soup). \n\n-<mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> and shrimp skewers: both came with a side of <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark>! so yummy! these are supposedly the two most popular of the anticuchos. \n\n-lima roll: a pretty standard <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark> roll. i would have rather tried another one of their small plates or tempura instead. \n\nbetween two people this was more than enough food. overall, a really great and satisfying meal with <mark>Uni</mark> flavors!", 
            "i came to this restaurant about a year ago for work related function.  at that time, my experience was very good, so i wanted to take my husband with me this time for him to experience the same.\n\nwhen we got there, the hostess set us at a table and asked us to move again because they had a reservation for party of 4, so they had to sit them there.  there were other tables with 4 people seats available, but we agreed to move.\n\nwhen i was here last time, the waiter was very nice and friendly and he had a good knowledge of the menu, especially the tasting menu options.  however, this time, we did not like our waitress.  when i decided to go there, i had tasting menu in my mind and i asked her to give me more explanations on that as i wasn't the one to order last time.   i am not sure if she was new to this place or not, but she seemed like she had no idea what the tasting menu entails or she didn't want to sell it.  she basically said that there are 3 courses and they can customize it if we had any preferences or allergies.  however, she did not say anything about what kind of foods will be on the tasting menu, whether they are from the regular menu vs off the menu items and even what kind of foods we will be served.  when i asked for difference between different tasting menu options, she basically said the quality of meat and fish are different.  everything she said was very vague.  \n\nalthough we still didn't really get much info that we wanted, since my experience last time was pretty good, we decided to do the tasting menu with the waygu hot stone bbq thing.  the few items that we got were tasty.  we liked w<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> dumpling and chilean <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> with corns.  their  ceviche taco thing was okay and we were not a big fan of the tuna appetizer that they brought out.  we got the w<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> bbq which i think is good to try it as a experience as the meat was tasty and it is a <mark>Uni</mark> experience but i am not too sure if it is worth it to pay $128 for 4 oz w<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> to grill it on a hot stone.  \n\nafter trying their tuna dish, we realized that we can have sushi in la too, so we asked the waitress to suggest something <mark>Uni</mark> to the restaurant rather than sushi or rolls which we can get other places for part of tasting menu as she said she can customize it for us. however, she couldn't really give us any suggestions or tell us how they can customize for us.  by then, we were not happy about the service and some of the foods that we tried, so we decided to cancel the tasting menu and pay for whatever we ate and left early.  \n\nmaybe my expectation was high for this place but i am really disappointed on their waitress' knowledge on their menu and some of the foods.  it was a very special night for us, so i really wanted it to be special but i have to say that dining at sushi samba definitely was not the highlight of our evening, rather more of a disappointment of the evening.  i saw every food item that we were served on the regular menu, so maybe it is better to stick with ordering off the menu rather than tasting menu and skip the w<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> hot stone bbq.  i won't be going back to this place in the future.\n\nfoods: 2.5 stars\natmosphere: 3 stars\nservice: 0 star\noverall experience: 1 star",

            "i've stayed at the venetian/palazzo a dozen times and had never eaten at sushi samba. what a terrible mistake i've made all these years. looking for a restaurant in the hotel for our bachelor party, we decided upon sushisamba due to the variety of dishes, the vibrant atmosphere, and positive word of mouth reviews. we made a reservation through opentable, and were promptly seated upon arrival.\n\nsamba proclaims to have the most extensive sake selection in vegas, and we let our server choose a cheaper bottle for us and it was delicious. \n\n1) japanese a5 <mark>Seared W<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> Beef</mark> gyoza (4.5/5) - you get 5 delicious pot stickers with quality beef that just melts in your mouth\n\n2) yellowtail taquito (5/5) - there are two mandatory dishes to get and this is one of them. essentially a mini taco with yellowtail, roasted corn miso, and avocado. the explosion of flavor was mind-numbingly good and even friends who don't enjoy seafood loved this\n\n3) yellowtail sashimi (4.5/5) - 4 slices of high quality yellowtail, the sauce is delicate and sour\n\n4)  <mark>Berkshire Pork Belly</mark> (3.75/5) - i am admittedly biased towards <mark>Berkshire Pork Belly</mark> so i loved the dish. the butterscotch miso on top was a little overwhelming but the <mark>Berkshire Pork Belly</mark> itself was cooked to perfection\n\n5) <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> anticucho (5/5) - this is the other mandatory dish. we were very for<mark>Tuna</mark> because the table next to us came 15 minutes after and they ran out of this dish! the <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> skewer is  their signature dish and deservedly so. two skewers of <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> cooked so perfectly (soft on inside, slightly crispy exterior), there aren't enough superlatives to describe how delicious it is. \n\n6) <mark>Rio Grande</mark> (4/5) - from their churrasco menu, includes three types of meat: ribeye, chorizo, and w<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> picanha. i would not suggest this if you are eating by yourself or with another because it is just so much meat. in a larger group setting, i think this dish is perfect to share. the w<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> picanha is my favorite because the meat was so soft and tender.\n\nquite simply, i loved my experience at sushisamba. the service was fantastic. the food was <mark>Uni</mark> and delicious at the same time. the atmosphere embodies that of vegas- vibrant and exciting. the price of the dinner was what i'd expect from a \"strip\" restaurant, so be prepared to spend at least $50. \n\ni can't wait to go back to sushisamba for some yellowtail tacos and <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>.",

            "i was really excited about coming here after reading some of these reviews. this is gonna be a long one, please hang in there. \n\nreading about the omakase experiences was what got me interested. i'll spare you the details on the interior. (aunny d. explained it perfectly) the place is just fricken nice, beautifully decorated and the perfect hang out spot. they hired very attractive hostesses that were extremely friendly. the service we received from our waiter and the staff was simply awesome. \n\nnow for the food.....\n\nwe had a party of 5 and our original plan was to order both <mark><mark>Osetra Caviar Imperial 20g</mark> 20g</mark>($100) and the sushi samba omakase ($80). after going through the menu, we decided to order up a variety of items rather than go with the omakase. this way, you end up getting food that would be in the omakase anyway, more food (omakase 7 -course), and for less. \n\n\"small plates\" and \"seviches & tiraditos\"  (<mark>Grade A5</mark> a to f)\n\n<mark>Tuna Tataki</mark>  - (c+) chef overuses tatsoi that practically kills the dish\n\nseared kobe beef -(f) just not worth it. mushrooms overwhelms it\n\nchicharron de calamar - (a) excellent and generous amount!\n\nsashimi seviches - (b) grapefruit juice, jalape\\u00f1o, almond + \npassionfruit,  cucumber, cilantro \n\nsashimi tiraditos - (d) yellowtail jalape\\u00f1o and lemongrass + salmon orange and mustard miso\n\nsushi is obviously the trendy thing to have on a restaurants menu. sushi samba serves up some of the most below average sashimi and sushi. for $33, we had the <mark>Samba Sushi</mark> and sashimi combo. the sashimi was nice and thick.  both salmon and yellowtail were quite good, but the tuna was poorly prepared and lacked any freshness. the sushi was a complete joke. you get a small wafer thin slice of sashimi on a rabbit dropping sized glob of rice. most japanese restaurants, for any combo sushi plate, give you two pieces each - tuna, salmon, and yellowtail. sushi samba gives you one. my whole table thought this was a complete joke and ripoff. it doesnt end here....we ordered 4 different rolls. guess what? they're all puny and only have 4 pieces averaging $10-$20 each. we also ordered the 5 hand roll special ($28) which was okay, but the soy wrap just doesnt work. \n\nnow here's how we felt that the chefs were completely lazy or inexperienced. the sushi rice had no vinegar flavor and that is a must for sushi rice. plus, they used old rice because we had some hard dried pieces in our rolls. overall, i would not waste any money on sushi here. it's a complete insult to customers. \n\nour final dish was the 5 meat churrasco: grilled hanger steak, ribeye, pork tenderloin, chorizo, ling\\u00fci\\u00e7a with malagueta pepper oil and chimichurri.  - this dish was fantastic. the meat, cooked medium, was tender and juicy. (a+)\n\nnow, we had a total of about 16-17 items of various things off the menu. more than double than what you'll get in a omakase.  we had about 5 bottles of japanese beers. our cost  per person was $92 with tax and tip included. (5 people) \n\ni would love to come back just for the atmosphere and the churrasco. its simply a cool place to hang out and drink. dont come here for the japanese food. go to a real japanese restaurant for the omakase. just seeing how the sushi, sashimi, and rolls are prepared makes me question the chef's experience in preparing a true omakase.  \n\nif you actually read this whole thing. thanks!",

            "i was really excited about coming here after reading some of these reviews. this is gonna be a long one, please hang in there. \n\nreading about the omakase experiences was what got me interested. i'll spare you the details on the interior. (aunny d. explained it perfectly) the place is just fricken nice, beautifully decorated and the perfect hang out spot. they hired very attractive hostesses that were extremely friendly. the service we received from our waiter and the staff was simply awesome. \n\nnow for the food.....\n\nwe had a party of 5 and our original plan was to order both <mark><mark>Osetra Caviar Imperial 20g</mark> 20g</mark>($100) and the sushi samba omakase ($80). after going through the menu, we decided to order up a variety of items rather than go with the omakase. this way, you end up getting food that would be in the omakase anyway, more food (omakase 7 -course), and for less. \n\n\"small plates\" and \"seviches & tiraditos\"  (<mark>Grade A5</mark> a to f)\n\n<mark>Tuna Tataki</mark>  - (c+) chef overuses tatsoi that practically kills the dish\n\nseared kobe beef -(f) just not worth it. mushrooms overwhelms it\n\nchicharron de calamar - (a) excellent and generous amount!\n\nsashimi seviches - (b) grapefruit juice, jalape\\u00f1o, almond + \npassionfruit,  cucumber, cilantro \n\nsashimi tiraditos - (d) yellowtail jalape\\u00f1o and lemongrass + salmon orange and mustard miso\n\nsushi is obviously the trendy thing to have on a restaurants menu. sushi samba serves up some of the most below average sashimi and sushi. for $33, we had the <mark>Samba Sushi</mark> and sashimi combo. the sashimi was nice and thick.  both salmon and yellowtail were quite good, but the tuna was poorly prepared and lacked any freshness. the sushi was a complete joke. you get a small wafer thin slice of sashimi on a rabbit dropping sized glob of rice. most japanese restaurants, for any combo sushi plate, give you two pieces each - tuna, salmon, and yellowtail. sushi samba gives you one. my whole table thought this was a complete joke and ripoff. it doesnt end here....we ordered 4 different rolls. guess what? they're all puny and only have 4 pieces averaging $10-$20 each. we also ordered the 5 hand roll special ($28) which was okay, but the soy wrap just doesnt work. \n\nnow here's how we felt that the chefs were completely lazy or inexperienced. the sushi rice had no vinegar flavor and that is a must for sushi rice. plus, they used old rice because we had some hard dried pieces in our rolls. overall, i would not waste any money on sushi here. it's a complete insult to customers. \n\nour final dish was the 5 meat churrasco: grilled hanger steak, ribeye, pork tenderloin, chorizo, ling\\u00fci\\u00e7a with malagueta pepper oil and chimichurri.  - this dish was fantastic. the meat, cooked medium, was tender and juicy. (a+)\n\nnow, we had a total of about 16-17 items of various things off the menu. more than double than what you'll get in a omakase.  we had about 5 bottles of japanese beers. our cost  per person was $92 with tax and tip included. (5 people) \n\ni would love to come back just for the atmosphere and the churrasco. its simply a cool place to hang out and drink. dont come here for the japanese food. go to a real japanese restaurant for the omakase. just seeing how the sushi, sashimi, and rolls are prepared makes me question the chef's experience in preparing a true omakase.  \n\nif you actually read this whole thing. thanks!", 
            "modern chic fusion restaurant in the new palazzo hotel, featuring brazilian and japanese food. the interior much reminded me of social house in treasure island, dark and swanky. the small plates are meant for sharing, but the tab adds up quick. the server proclaimed their sake menu as the largest in the country, but unfor<mark>Tuna</mark> we didn't get to try any.\n\nwe had the <mark><mark>Assortment of Four</mark></mark> sashimi which were nice and fresh with delicate flavors. my favorite was the tuna with granny smith apple, serrano, and lime.\n\nthe <mark>Hamachi Kama</mark> (yellowtail cheek) was as good as i've had, but missing the grated daikon that it <mark><mark>Osetra Caviar Imperial 20g</mark> 20g</mark> comes with.\n\nchicken liver anticuchos (two skewers served over <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark>) were very livery. i expected them to be only lightly livery, like my favorite pho ga place serves up, not sure if it's due to the prep or the <mark>Grade A5</mark> liver or what.\n\nwe also tried a couple rolls, the <mark>Neo Tokyo</mark> with yellowfin tuna, tempura flake, aji panca. i liked this one more than the bobo brazil with seared kobe beef, avocado, kaiware, shiso, red onion, chimichurri. the kobe beef looked raw rather than seared, maybe seared would have brought out the flavors a bit. both rolls were pretty good though.\n\nthe standout of the meal was the <mark>Berkshire Pork Belly</mark> butterscotch miso, which was meltingly tender, with a subtle sweetness contrasting the richness of the luscious pork.\n\nwe also tried the little tiny crabs we saw in an ad, sawagani, which are flash fried japanese river crabs. these were literally tiny, and the small bite had a texture like an egg shell, with a flavor best described as a subtle fish sauce.\n\ncome here if you have an appetite for a variety of small bites with delicate but well thought out flavors.",

            "i had doubt on this place. \n\nhow would brazilian food work well with japanese food? i only love authentic japanese food. i sure can have the typical combination, but i only see that as american japanese food. \n\nsometimes i feel like a restaurant that does fusion because it does not have a firm grip to do the real deal. \n\nbut this place changed my mind. it earned my respect. i ordered some grill items, some sushi rolls, and some nigiri. the nigiri was done properly. the portion of rice and fish was proper. i enjoyed two of the sushi rolls: yamato (tuna, <mark>Foie Gras</mark>, <mark><mark>Osetra Caviar Imperial 20g</mark> 20g</mark>, gold leaf) and <mark>Rainbow Dragon</mark> (freshwater eel, red bell pepper, cucumber, mango, avocado). i know, the <mark>Rainbow Dragon</mark> roll sounds like a stable nowadays (like chicken teriyaki). but i was surprised by the use of mango in the roll. the mango gave that interesting bite to it. the yamato roll was a surprise - i didn't expect <mark>Foie Gras</mark> would go so well with ahi tuna. but the gold leave was pointless (in my opinion) other than giving a bling bling (and charge extra expensive) for the roll. \n\nthe seviches was just ok (i.e. within expectation). but the robata was good - we had fillet mignon and lamb. we also had japanese kobe beef (well, we were travelling at vegas - so we just splurged on our food instead of spending it at the outlet). it was good. but i think it's overpriced. if you haven't had japanese kobe beef before, you don't have to try it at this place unless you are ready to spend some money or to celebrate your win at the casino. \n\nthe decor has those typical hip restaurant vibe. the harajuku graffiti was a bit awkward to me but i guess most customers will think that's cool. but i wasn't impressed by the video that was played by the restaurant when i was there. we were there for an early dinner (to catch a show at the hotel). so we were there around 5:45. and the restaurant was playing some party video was not that respectful in my opinion. pretty much you only see a brunch of people partying and dancing and showing their skins. (only a few step away from girls gone wild japanese party version). there were some close up of girls' legs and cleavage that kinda bothered me. \n\nluckily, some customers requested to watch something else. it was the time about the bailout plan and eventually the large screen was showing news. \n\nso the party video took that star away. \n\nalthough it's kinda dark in the restaurant, i saw a couple with two young kids having dinner as well. it's not necessary kids friendly but kids are welcome. \n\nbut the food at this place was surprisingly good. so, it's worth to give a try. and if you are catching a show, the restaurant will make sure you will be able to make it. :)", 
            "what can i say about sushi samba? maybe i was not in the mood to dance. i was in the mood for sushi. <mark><mark>Osetra Caviar Imperial 20g</mark> 20g</mark>, which is apparently not their specialty. i mean it is called sushi samba so i expected some south american food with the sushi but not even a philly roll? aside from the crazy menu which actually was decent i just wasn't feeling that adventurous that night, the service was great. the samurai staring at me while i peed was a little unnerving and also a little erotic.the one thing that kept throwing me off was that i thought i went to a restaurant not a nightclub. i couldn't hear my server ask me if i wanted a refill on my delicious drink. dark and loud. which is perfect if all you need to order is a whiskey/ginger or rum/coke or something along those lines but what you need to order is the capoeira roll and a green envy roll hold the wasabi pea crust and wtf is yamagobo? that's gotta be hard to explain when you aren't screaming over the dj....", 
            "i've been jaded by the whole fusion cuisine fare as there's so many that have done it terribly wrong.\n\nthis isn't the case at sushi samba.\n\nmy wife and i decided we take a chance and boy we were impressed.  i let our waitress know that we'd just like to try \"whatevers good\" and to please do not hold back...\n\nwe were entertained with 4 different sashimi dishes, tuna with a granny smith green apple puree, kampachi in truffle oil, squeeze of lime & some sea salt, salmon in mandarin orange reduction & kampachi in some sort of chile vinegrette... all awesome.\n\nnext we were served with some items from the robata, although the end pieces of the <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> did come off a bit dry, the prep, grilled green onion and center of the piece made up for it... i would of liked it not so seared but still great flavors.\n\nthis was also my first time having a ceviche with passion fruit sauce, let alone a lobster ceviche.. it was absolutely delicious. the sauce <mark>Shrimp and Vegetables</mark> were super colorful but all the flavors complimented each other nicely. a tiny bit of sourness from the passion fruit to substitute the <mark><mark>Osetra Caviar Imperial 20g</mark> 20g</mark>, and some truffle oil made it taste super buttery.. super delicious.\n\nthere were a couple other dishes that weren't as memorable, but were still very delicious.  eitherway, it didnt break our bank and i enjoyed our \"early dinner\".\n\nservice was great. pretty standard for all the restaurants there (we went to the las vegas, nv location in the palazzo)", 
            "i think the reason why i put off this review for 2 months is that i've been afraid of not praising this place enough with what i'm about to say in a couple of lines. first of all, thanks to my procrastination, i've forgotten the incredibly friendly manager's name who treated us newly legals to 3 chu-cumber shots, which, btw, go down ridiculously well. (maybe his name was anthony...?) anyway, he also hooked us up with a bouncer at tryst and we got in without having to wait! so the staff and their service is really really amazing. i'm pretty positive if you go there (soon), there will still be this omg-drool-with-my-eyes-like-it's-possible waiter there ready and waiting to fill up your glass of water... or take your order... or ravage - no, that's it. \n\nenough about the awesome service, the food was also really really amazing. it's a brazilian/japanese fusion type restaurant, but i'm not really big on brazilian unless it's like a churascaria, so we went with mainly japanese type dishes. (i mean \"japanese\" in the most non-<mark><mark>Osetra Caviar Imperial 20g</mark> 20g</mark> though) \n\nthe condensed version looks like this and in this order (but all should be had at least once - write it down guys, seriously. prepare yourselves):\nbobo brazil roll\ngreen envy roll\n<mark>El Topo</mark> roll\nmiso marinated chilean <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> (way too small for it's own good.) \n<mark>Neo Tokyo</mark> roll\n\nthis place is pretty pricey, but i've been here 3 times already and i don't intend to stop. i've pretty much made an agreement with myself that i will eat here at least once any time i'm in vegas. \n\n5 stars!! \n\nokay, and i know i mentioned \"condensed version\" earlier which implies a more in-depth explanation to those, but too bad? you're just going to have to trust me. \n\nhappy gambling, happy clubbing, happy eating, and happy samba-ing. :)", 
            "our waiter made a really good point that many people believe your restaurant is a <mark><mark>Osetra Caviar Imperial 20g</mark> 20g</mark> restaurant if you have sushi in the name. however, this place certainly did not disappoint.\n\nso this location is a mix of chilean, brazilian, and japanese tastes. it certainly was <mark>Uni</mark>. the environment is vibrant and alive. i felt that it really complimented their fusion style really well. they had flat screen tvs and projectors everywhere, showing pleasant scenery or <mark><mark>Osetra Caviar Imperial 20g</mark> 20g</mark>. i was just amazed by their design and color throughout the restaurant. their decor was also very compatible with their theme. the look was sharp and inviting at the same time.\n\nthe food was great. i tried the bobo brazil roll. i tried this because i wanted to experience their <mark>Uni</mark> tastes, and it certainly brought the restaurant's fusion tastes together. it had seared kobe beef and red onions on top of what i think was an avocado roll with kaiware, and some other ingredients. it cost $17; the taste was awesome, but we could not decide whether or not it was worth the full $17. other items we ordered included a <mark>Berkshire Pork Belly</mark> ramen, a ribeye bento box, and a terriyaki chicken bento box. these were generic dishes, but they turned out great.  \nthe restaurant serves dishes in appetizer or small portions. do not expect a large portion when ordering an entree. this restaurant is more for people who want to shell out a little bit of cash to enjoy something <mark>Uni</mark>. four of us ordered a total of 6 items and then mochi ice cream for desert. \n\nthe service was really on top of everything. our waiter knew the menu and was able to tell us what was in every item we asked, and told us what to expect from the restaurant's style of cooking. he came around periodically to make sure everything was okay, and just did a perfect job.\n\ni would definitely recommend people to try this place at least once. it is a little on the pricey end, but it is worth the quality of food that you receive.", 
            "went here twice on a recent foray in vegas - once for dinner at the bar and a second time just drinking at the bar.\n\nsushi-wise, the restaurant does a good job. their rolls are creative and beautifully presented. check out the <mark>Rainbow Dragon</mark>, as the use of red peppers offers a pretty un-<mark><mark>Osetra Caviar Imperial 20g</mark> 20g</mark> on japanese sushi rolls. it's definitely expensive to grab a meal here once you tack on drinks, but i would say it's worth it. don't come expecting traditional/formal sushi, although you can definitely get that if you come here. i would recommend being adventurous and getting something that is <mark>Uni</mark> to the restaurant. the portions aren't huge and while it's easy to complain about that, well, this ain't the wynn buffet people! consider it your opport<mark>Uni</mark> to splurge and try a plethora of dishes to widen your palate. or, since their kitchen is open well past midnight, stroll in later in the night for a post-gambling/show/club-hopping snack.\n\nsamba-wise, the ambiance fits the decor they're trying to promote - some sort of trendy and dark restaurant. if you want a quiet meal, don't come here (actually - why are you even in vegas??).\n\ndrink-wise, this place excels. the tequilana caliente is a tasty cocktail that packs a punch. the caipirinha uses high quality leblon cacha\\u00e7a. and if those two aren't good enough (or you're like me and you drink both cocktails and want a third), try the chu-cumber sochu - our bartender made this into a shot, which went down so smoothly even though it was basically all alcohol. the one downside that evening was that they were out of their plums for their bushido drink, a cocktail that has daikon in it too. i guess that means there's always something to come back to.",

            "new york, miami and now finally las vegas.  the food presentation is all about variety - small portions chased with some sake, beer or other beverage of choice.  i was expecting loud, but vegas was a bit more subtle, yet maintained all the vibe.  the seating is interesting as nothing is square and the colors are warm peruvian and the food is pretty japanese with a dose of flavors atypical of <mark><mark>Osetra Caviar Imperial 20g</mark> 20g</mark> foods - like limes and jalapenos.  but my wife and i loved it.  cerviche with yellow tail was the opener along with roasted duck over a bed a mushrooms (a combo of two menu items recommended by our server), then <mark>Salt and Pepper Squid</mark> (calamari- esq) and a tuna skewer served with huge corn - <mark>Uni</mark> combo, rice would have been fine with me.  we rounded the meal with two sushi rolls - one with jalapenos, fried onions and a bit of cheese and another fancy hamachi roll.  delicious, fun, great multi server service.  a great prelude to catching jersey boys at palazzo!", 
            "sushi samba is a great place to have an afternoon drink amidst hang overs from friday and saturday night in vegas.  i came here on a sunday afternoon and ordered the speciality cocktail - samba juice - and the <mark>El Topo</mark> roll as a snack!\n\nthe el tapo roll is the perfect mix between brazilian and japanese cuisine, and it tasted great with my fruity drink!  it was a bit crunchy with cheese sprinkled on top, definitely something you will not find at a <mark><mark>Osetra Caviar Imperial 20g</mark> 20g</mark> japanese resturant.  \n\ni would come here again for a full meal - but of course, like any other las vegas restaurant, the price is a bit over the top.  but what else can you expect from an asian fusion restaurant?", 
            "i absolutely loved eating here. the atmosphere is great, cool decoration. the service was fantastic and our server was very friendly. i would list off everything we ordered, but there were five of us and i couldn't remember the names of half the things we ordered, let alone all the desserts (we ordered 3 sampler platters for dessert, so i'll just stick to a few. my father ordered one of the duck dishes, i don't remember which one since i didn't place the order, but it was fantastic. the duck was perfectly cooked and the sauce was a perfect complement to the natural flavors of the duck. the two rolls we ordered were the <mark>Samba Strip</mark> and the bobo brazil. the bobo brazil was absolutely phenomenal. the seared kobe inside was of great quality and worked very well with all of the other ingredients. the <mark>Samba Strip</mark> was very different for me, as i had never had a roll with lobster and was a little unsure, but i'm glad we went with it! i loved the way the peanut curry worked with the mango and the texture of the lobster. the most memorable part of the night, by far, was ordering the dessert. my girlfriend is from brazil and one of her absolute favorite things is brigadeiro. she was ecstatic to see it on the dessert menu in one of the dishes, because it is difficult to find a place that makes brigadeiro (good or not aside, there just aren't many places that have it), especially where we live (az). she asked our server if she could just get a small plate of brigadeiro by itself for dessert, and the server he would have to check with the chef. here, though, they went a little above and beyond for me. despite the brigadeiro being listed only as an ingredient in a dish, the chef said that they would make a plate by itself, just for us. however, the chef wanted to inform us that it was not <mark><mark>Osetra Caviar Imperial 20g</mark> 20g</mark>, and even prepared a small sample for us to try before ordering a plate so that we wouldn't be disappointed if we were hoping for the <mark><mark>Osetra Caviar Imperial 20g</mark> 20g</mark>. i can't find fault with service like that.\n\non a side-note, they have a dish that is cooked on a hot stone and comes out sizzling on that hot stone. i have no idea what it was called, but it was ordered repeatedly by other tables and smelled absolutely phenomenal. i would go back just to sit at the bar and be able to smell that dish being brought out to other tables.", 
            "thursday night. 9pm. \nour reservations were honored to the minute and the man who runs the show, mike durovsik, at once made us feel not just like welcomed guests but old friends.\n\nmy fiance and i were indulged with a 9 course specialized server's omakase. the food was superb, and the service exceeds even the best definitions of accommodating. \n\nour charming and attentive server asked immediately how adventurous we were willing to get, and since we had no objections to anything particular, our meal immediately commenced.\n\nfirst was the otsumami, three small dishes: <mark>Green Bean Tempura</mark> with a creamy truffle aoli dipping sauce (incredible), shishito peppers charcoal grilled and just the right amount of spicy, as well as edamame sprinkled with sea salt.\n\nnext came hamachi (yellowtail) tacos paired with a fizzing sort of vinegarette (spicy aji panca) on the side to top it off- this was filled with so much flavour it literally forced my eyes to roll back. a real treat that i'd highly  reccommend.\n\nat this point it was quite apparent that service and timing was top notch. the bottle of sake we brought was being chilled tableside and water never fell below the 2/3rds mark. as the bottle chilled we tasted two different cocktails-  kumori, a cucumber cocktail with shochu and nigori which was refreshing, easy, and delicious.  alongside was the ever popular nina fresa, a strawberry cocktail with vodka. both made for easy, yet yummy drinking.\n\ntheir mushroom toban yaki was divinely creamy- we got ours with bincho tan grilled lamb on top which paired quite nicely with those garlic chips. their were five different kinds of perfectly cooked mushrooms in the mix, and all around it made for a <mark>Uni</mark> filling appetizer. my fiances words: that fu**ing amazing lamb dish ;)\n\nthe sashimi tiradito i'm always raving about came next. still on a midblowing level, i noticed that their are different flavour notes (though served with the same ingredients) for the nyc location and the las vegas one. so if you think you've had it before, you haven't. though different, the fish is always immensely fresh and the taste accents are truly wonderful. my favorite is the kanpachi since i'm a sucker for yuzu (japanese citrus) and my fiance was a big fan of the hamachi- if you're torn, go with the assortment of all four and you won't have any regrets.\n\noff the robata grill (bincho tan charcoal) came the most decadant <mark><mark>Alaskan King Crab</mark> Leg</mark> imaginable- our taste buds were literally in shock from the mastermind talents of chef oscar toro. bedded atop rock salt, the crab was creamy, fell apart smoothly, and the flavours enhanced the entire piece of already fresh seafood. a seasonal dish that may not always be available... so wonderful. if they don't have it on menu, go for the spiny lobster.\n\nalso from from the robata grill we enjoyed the miso glazed <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> with baby corn. again, this dish can be done so many different ways at different high end japanese restaurants- but sushi samba's brazillian take really heightens the tastes.\n\nask for the freshest oysters of the day- you can go with <mark><mark>Osetra Caviar Imperial 20g</mark> 20g</mark>, paired with yuzu jelly and lemon, or a more contemporary take which chef oscar toro will create specially for that oyster.- both ways are unforgettable.\n\nmy absolute favorite dish is the kobe ishiyaki. you grill fresh pieces of perfectly marbleized kobe tableside 3-5 seconds on each side on an extremely hot river stone. you get 4-5 sauces and and array of salts to mix up the taste buds for you- absolutely the most decadently delicious dish. whenever i see this i must have it, and sushi samba's is the best i've had. not enough people indulge in this and you must must must!!! \n\nour sushi/sashimi platter was fresh and wonderful- exquisite. we got the <mark>Neo Tokyo</mark> and the <mark>El Topo</mark> rolls- <mark>Neo Tokyo</mark> has tuna and a bit of spicy to it, and the <mark>El Topo</mark> is served warm- a surprising aspect, but the melted mozzarella is such a <mark>Uni</mark> addition. it's like the movie \"<mark>El Topo</mark>\" you must try/ see both! \n\nfor dessert we went with mochi; a soft and chewy japanese dessert that is <mark><mark>Osetra Caviar Imperial 20g</mark> 20g</mark> not overly sweet. sushi samba adds ice cream to the center and offers all the best flavours. \n\nby the end of our meal and a finished bottle of sake, we were both more than pleasantly buzzed and satiated with an incredible meal. \n\n\n**************\nbottom line, if you are trying to decide between nobu and sushi samba, pass on nobu and put some samba in your seafood!!\n\nthank you again mike and oscar for such a wonderful night!!", 
            "sushi samba puts an excellent spin on <mark><mark>Osetra Caviar Imperial 20g</mark> 20g</mark>.  the fusion of japanese and south american flavors are a perfect combination.  since i like my food on the spicy side, i found that sushi samba adds that flare to usually very neutral sushi.  \n\nthe one dish i found to be my favorite of the visit was the hamachi (yellowtail) sashimi tiradito.  hamachi is always a great choice for its oil content, but along with the spicy/tangy sauce it is served on is a more than suitable replacement for shoyu.  i also tried the yamato roll, which is sushi with maguro and  <mark>Foie Gras</mark>, a great and <mark>Uni</mark> flavor.  one disappointment i found was the kobe beef sushi.  i would rather have had otoro.  one last recommendation, don't order collard greens at a sushi place.  it was decent although it was no southern style collard greens that i prefer.  \n\ni will definitely go back to sushi samba the next time i am in vegas.  there are so many things on the menu that i still want to try!", 
            "i was in town for a bachelorette party and ate here for our \"nice dinner\" friday night. the ambiance was awesome. i loved the vibe of the place.... bu the most important part, the food, was just okay and truly nothing to write home about. it lacked depth, flavor, and overall \"wow this is awesome.\" not one single dish stood out to me. i didn't like the melting pot of japanese, peruvian, and brazilian. stick with one and make it amazing. don't dabble in all three. perhaps that's me being a <mark><mark>Osetra Caviar Imperial 20g</mark> 20g</mark>, but so be it.\n\nthe waitress seemed put off by the large quantity of us at the table. she huffed and puffed constantly. she highly suggested that we pick a dollar amount and stick with it. when we asked if we could order something from the menu separately, it was frowned upon. we'd tell her what we liked/didn't like and they'd customize the menu for us - sticking to our chosen $$ range. if we didn't like something, they'd take it back and replace it with another item from the menu. in a way, kinda cool and makes sense but then again, it was frustrating. we couldn't pick things we eyed on the menu. we had to cross our fingers it showed up. \n\ni won't go back. okada blows this place out of the water. so does sushi roku. go there instead if you're craving sushi while in vegas.", 
            "yum!\n\ncame here for dinner whilst on vacation. cute place with a bar area and then more extensive seating for the restaurant area. our party of 3 ordered an appetizer of kobe beef (super super pricey! our waitress had to inform us that the actual price was even more expensive than what was listed on the menu) and i wanted yellowtail so we got the hamachi sashimi tiradito. the kobe was really tender and delicious; we got to cook it on a hot rock ourselves. it came with an assortment of sauces and oils and salts, but my preference was just to dip it in the sesame oil before cooking it and then getting a few grains of the black rock salt to stick to the edge of the meat before eating it. the tiradito was yummy too. it came with a tangy spicy, ginger-y sauce (that was also given to us with the kobe) and was topped with little red jalepeno slices (and since i love spicy foods, that was awesome to me).\n\nfor main entr\\u00e9es, we ordered the chef special sushi platter and asked to make sure they gave us the 'yamato' as one of the rolls (which is really fancy with <mark>Foie Gras</mark> and tuna and <mark><mark>Osetra Caviar Imperial 20g</mark> 20g</mark> gold leaf). we also ordered the 'bobo brazil' which contains kobe beef and chimichurri (one of my favorite sauces) amongst other things, and the '<mark>Rainbow Dragon</mark>' which had a wasabi pea crust on it, which made the texture really interesting (in a good way).\n\nto go with our meal, we also ordered several different kinds of sake. we ended up having the manager (who is an avid sake enthusiast and has been to japan many times to find delicious sake for the restaurant) help us out with choosing the right sake to go with our dishes. we started off with an unfiltered, super fruity, sweet sake which i fell in love with. i'm not a big fan of sake usually, but this one was really good. the other ones we tried were all pretty good too (light and i could barely taste the alcohol) but they were all overshadowed by the first one we had.\n\nsince we had already racked up a pretty extensive bill with all the food that we ordered, we decided to splurge on a little dessert too. i ordered the 'carmen miranda' which is just seasonal fruits with a little cake and yuzu sorbet. the sorbet was tart and refreshing and a nice way to end the meal (like a palette cleanser and breath saver! haha). someone else ordered the warm chocolate banana cake. our server told us it was the most popular dessert but warned us that it was super rich and heavy. it came out in a huge flying saucer shaped dish with a tiny dip in the middle to hold the dessert. i didn't taste it but it definitely smelled and looked amazing and the guy who ordered it seemed to enjoy it.\n\noh! and the highlight of the night was when the dj started playing some fedde le grand tracks!! gawd. a meal encompasses not only the food, but the ambiance, and that was perfect for me. (the dj was set up in a really accessible location, so i'm sure you could go and request stuff if the music you're hearing isn't adding to your meal).",

            "my friends and i came here for happy hour.  \n\nthere wasn't much room at the bar, but i found a single table in the bar.  i asked the hostess if we could sit there and she said yes but we had to order from the bar. i asked the hostess for menus and after she told me i had to order from the bar she said someone would be there to help me. errr...ok? my friend didn't hear any of this, but the bartender was nice and said instead of having us go up to the bar, she would have a waiter serve us.  the waiter who came was also really nice.\n\ni ordered a veggie tempura and <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> roll. the veggie tempura roll was one of the bigger dishes there and was pretty good. it came with a <mark><mark>Osetra Caviar Imperial 20g</mark> 20g</mark> and a creamy tangy sauce.  the <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> roll had really weird rice.  it was smashed together and wasn't sushi rice.  i'm not sure that it was even <mark>Steamed Japanese Rice</mark>.  i know this is a fusion restaurant but please don't f up sushi rice! \n\n3 stars might seem a little harsh for bad rice, but as a whole, i guess i just wasn't that impressed.  it wasn't bad, but it was def. a'ight.", 
            "this restaurant caught my eye because it was something out of the ordinary from your typical sushi restaurant. the menu offered an intriguing variety but when i began reading the reviews i knew i had to try it. i would suggest anyone going there for the first time to try the dining experience because you may think you know what you want but the chef knows better! the server asks if there is anything you do not like or if you have any food allergies and then how much money per person you're looking to spend. there are options anywhere from $50 per person to $130 per person if kobe beef if something that interests you. as it was for a special occasion we opted for $80 per person and even though thats more than i have probably ever spent on a single meal there were no regrets.\n\ncourse #1 consisted of berkshire pork gyoza which is basically pork dumplings in a pumpkin puree and yellowtail ceviche taquitos, both of which were absolutely delicious and not necessarily something i would have ordered on my own.\n\ncourse #2 was yellowtail sashimi in a spicy peruvian sauce with a slice of red jalapeno on top and octopus sashimi in a japanese citrus sauce which again were both to die for!\n\ncourse #3 had an array of <mark>Filet Mignon</mark>, <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>, <mark>Alaskan King Crab</mark> and <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark>. all were moist and tender but the <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> absolutely melted in your mouth! <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark> was a yummy alternative to <mark><mark>Osetra Caviar Imperial 20g</mark> 20g</mark> as well.\n\nfinally, course #4 was the main sushi dinner. <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark> rolls were delicious, but the <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> with i believe tuna on top was absolutely amazing! there was also <mark>Half Maine Lobster</mark> and another roll which i believe had lobster in it as well and was probably the only thing of the entire dinner that i was not absolutely amazed with, but it was still good!\n\nanother great thing about this place is they tell you if there is anything throughout this meal you do not like they will take it back and bring you something else! as our server said, \"its like a money back guarantee!\"\n\nanyways this is definitely a place i would tell everyone who loves trying new things to try or even just the sushi lover. do it! it will not disappoint!\n\nonly part i would complain about is the fact that there is not one in california!!!", 
            "i like the ambiance of street meets mod and the energy is great. however, i give the sushi a b grade. they try really hard to dress up their sushi and rolls with interesting sauces and for the most part pull it off but i prefer <mark><mark>Osetra Caviar Imperial 20g</mark> 20g</mark> joints that wow you with the freshness of the fish and not the add ons. \n\none thing i highly recommend is the kobe beef. we chose the ishiyaki which roughly translates to \"hot rock\" in japanese. they bring out a black rock that is heated to 600 degrees along with a large array of oils, sauces, and salts. the waiter gave us a short lesson on how to prepare the meat and we went to town. preparing the meat ourselves added a nice social aspect to the business dinner but be aware that seven slices of thin kobe beef costs $150. cheers", 
            "it's interesting that back home, i partake in sushi once or twice a week without fail  ... and yet in vegas, while staying in a hotel where it seems every celebrity chef has at least one restaurant (and in many cases two)... i'm drawn to a \"sushi\" place once again.  \n\nnonetheless, the brazilian beats and atmosphere from the outside looking in made sushisamba seem different, and well worth trying. \n\nso we did.\n\nsushisamba is a japanese/brazilian/peruvian fusion restaurant.  hence the aforementioned \"beats.\" \n\nthe visuals of this place are more \"club\" than restaurant, both from a lighting/decor perspective, as well as the patrons drinking around the bar.  \n\nthat being said, as we were seated at our table, the fusion influences did highlight how somewhat boring and \"polite\" the sushi places i normally frequent actually are.  sushisamba has a much more vibrant atmosphere.\n\nregardless, i was in the mood for sushi, so i stayed within that zone on the menu. \n\nmy dinner companion fears the stuff... which made this place perfect.  i could indulge, while she self-cooked meat on a ultra hot stone in front of her (yes, that is an option).  \n\nthus, my sashimi/sushi/roll selection was served before me with zero guilt .\n\neverything either of us ordered was very good.  no complaints on the quality whatsoever.  the only negatives are repeated from what other reviewers have mentioned:\n\n--  if you order outside of the japanese realm, the price seems to go way up.  if you treat it as a sushi restaurant, the price is in line, even for vegas.  \n\n-- again, outside of the \"sushi\" realm, portion size could very well disappoint. \n\n--  the tables can feel a little too close for comfort with your neighbors.  but this varies depending on where you are seated.  \n\noverall, i am a fan of the <mark><mark>Osetra Caviar Imperial 20g</mark> 20g</mark>-restaurant  fare served here, because it trumps the overall experience i have elsewhere -- the quality is fine, the atmosphere is more fun.  \n\nventuring beyond that will no doubt deliver quality, but you may end up needing to order more than expected to be satisfied, and end up with a much lighter wallet.  \n\ncalgary yelp's 30 day challenge:  10/30", 
            "classy. dim. convenient. tons of lcd tvs. great food.\n\ni recommend the 25$ teriyaki chicken. the way sushisamba prepares chicken teriyaki is unlike any restaurant that ive ever been to. i was expecting some cookie cutter skimpy chicken teriyaki. but to my surprise the chicken teriyaki came on top of a pile of <mark>Purple Potato Mash</mark> potatoes and tasted amazing. the chicken was flavored perfectly and.. it melted in my mouth. moist, juicy, tender, man did i enjoy chewing that day. in combination with the mash potatoes makes for a most savory dish. \n\nsushi is also a good option here. sushi<mark>Samba Sushi</mark> comes lightly wrapped in rice rather than how sushi restaurants ordinarily fill their rolls with rice. i liked that. it accentuated the other ingredients such as kobe beef, <mark><mark>Osetra Caviar Imperial 20g</mark> 20g</mark>. we pretty much ordered all the rolls and each one was different from the next. although i cant say i enjoyed the kobe beef one as it was kind of bland. also, i wouldnt recommend the oysters because its quite ordinary.", 
            "if you want to try some sushi that's prepared with a delightful spin then this place is perfect for you. the atmosphere resembles a club more than a high class restaurant.  it's filled with fast-paced dance music and most of the guests are dressed like they are ready for the club after dinner. \n\nthe defining feature of the restaurant comes from its mixture of japanese and brazilian cuisine. our server recommended the seviches and tiraditos; since we couldn't decide which one to get we ordered both! seviches are sashimi served in a fruit/salsa. we had tiger shrimp in a mango salsa and tuna with grapefruit and jalapenos. the sashimi was super fresh and i loved the fruit/salsa combo.  it was sweet and refreshing. tiraditos are sashimi immersed in a tangy sauce, probability the only dish i wasn't too fond of though.  the sauce was too sour and it overwhelmed the fish. \n\nif eating an endangered animal does not affect your conscience i would highly recommend the chilean <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> skewers. the fish was amazing, the meat practically flakes off on its own and the unagi sauce was so umami! \n\ni saved the best for last. imagine eating all of the finest food: <mark>Foie Gras</mark>, <mark><mark>Osetra Caviar Imperial 20g</mark> 20g</mark> gold?!?! all in one bite. hurry to sushisamba and order the yamato roll.  at first the combination of those above ingredient wrapped in a tuna roll may seem excessive, but it absolutely worked.  it is the best roll i ever had.  the <mark><mark>Osetra Caviar Imperial 20g</mark> 20g</mark> gold were subtle, but the <mark>Foie Gras</mark>, infused its smoky buttery flavor to an otherwise ordinary but fresh tuna roll, made it special. i would like to add, the <mark>Foie Gras</mark> was one of the finest i have ever eaten and it came from a sushi restaurant.\n\ntry sushisamba if you are in vegas to get a delectable and <mark>Uni</mark> sushi experience.", 
            "japanese/brazilian fusion is an intriguing concept.  the good: <mark>Green Bean Tempura</mark> with black truffle aioli, antichuco tenderloin with <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark>, and warm banana chocolate pie.  as far as sushi rolls go: just because you combine a bunch of flavors together doesn't necessarily make them tasty.  the <mark>Alaskan King Crab</mark> roll with pear was downright odd.  it was served with some type of avocado crema that was not complementary to the crab.  everything overpowered the fish, in fact i'm not even sure if the roll contained fish.  a green envy roll advertised a wasabi pea crust that i thought would give it crunch. negative.  just a light dusting to give the roll yet again an odd flavor.  if you enjoy more <mark><mark>Osetra Caviar Imperial 20g</mark> 20g</mark> sushi this will not satisfy the craving. however, for light appetizers and drinks this makes for a good spot.", 
            "my friend wanted to celebrate her tax return and take me to lunch (hooray for me!!) she wanted to have sushi on the strip, well mostly all the sushi restaurants on the strip don't open until dinner, except sushisamba, so that's where we landed.  while we waited for them to open, i was scoping yelp reviews to see what we should order. the <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark> seemed to be the #1 suggestion, so that's what we started out with.  neither  one of us were impressed, sorry to say, but i felt like i was eating just a giant piece of corn kernal. but it was all uphill from there. \n\nour server, drago, was very attentive and full of suggestions, he had asked if we dined here before and i told him i had been to the one in miami, then he said he would bring us something on the house for coming back. when i tell you, you must order these, i'm not exaggerating, they were excellent, not on the menu, <mark>Broiled Peruvian Bay Scallop</mark>, prepared differently than the one on the menu. they were so good we had to order another round. i am a huge fan of yellowtail, so we ordered the yellowtail taquitos, so tasty, i loved the crunch that the mini taco shell added to the yellowtail flavor. next up was a table favorite as well, <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> miso, it melted in your mouth.  i was skeptical at first, they are served on a skewer, so i wasn't expecting the amazing flavor i tasted when i took my first bite. drago suggested the <mark>El Topo</mark> roll, both of us like hot,, super spicy food, this roll had a nice kick at the end, i normaily don't like any kind of dairy on my sushi rolls, i.e. cream cheese, etc....but this had melted mozzarella, it was excellent. then came the grand finale, my friend is a huge kobe beef fan so she wanted to try the <mark>Seared W<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> Beef</mark>, excellent <mark>Grade A5</mark>5, ishi yaki hot stone, dipping sauces, vegetables. presentation was so nice, lots of different sauces to try.  dessert, yes we still had room for dessert, we tried the peruvian hot chocolate con cr\\u00e8me served with <mark><mark>Osetra Caviar Imperial 20g</mark> 20g</mark> and the coco duo dark and white chocolate custard with praline. the second one was by far the best. a must. also try the house made iced tea, they mix fresh orange juice, lime juice and lemon with black tea.....think i drank a pitcher of it.  good food, service, ambiance!", 
            "we celebrated my birthday this year at sushisamba and it was exceptional. the best way to enjoy the menu here is to ask the waiter order the food for you. \n\nif you give them a set $$ amount that you want to spend they really stay within that figure and help you enjoy a variety of their dishes. more than you probably would if you tried to attempt on your own. \n\nstarting off the meal was a trio of veggie dishes including <mark>Green Bean Tempura</mark> with black truffle oil. happiness. we all loved that and ended up dipping everything we could into the truffle oil.\n\nfor the main course we had a selection of 5 different meats with a variety of dipping sauces including two types of chimichurri, one red and one green. the red had more of a vinegar flavor to it. different than <mark><mark>Osetra Caviar Imperial 20g</mark> 20g</mark> still delicious.\n\nsides included collard greens and <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark>. \n\nas a last course we were given 3 large cut rolls of sushi including the <mark>El Topo</mark>. a must if you want to experience salmon and crispy onions together. very different and quite delicious. \n\nobviously we had cocktails as it was my birthday, so my sister and i both ordered the chu cumber \"chu-tini\" and it was beyond. anything with elderflower in it is refreshing and light and makes me want to jump on a plane to the most lazy, tropical destination possible.\n\nthe waiter also threw in a sparkling (literally) coco duo dessert for my birthday. \n\nservice was great and we were all a very happy group by the time we headed out to see jabbawokeez!!",

            "we checked out this place over the weekend for a girlfriend's bachelorette celebration, and had a fantastic time.\n\ni don't remember our server's name, but he was very attentive, patient and focused on providing the best possible experience. we had a vegetarian in our group, and he was kind enough to tell us about the vegetarian options and even provide a vegan menu for us to explore. my only quip would be the restaurant's \"set your own price & we'll customize the menu \" option - when we heard about it, we were immediately enthusiastic and decided to set a $25 per head price. unfor<mark>Tuna</mark> the server told us that the restaurant wanted a $50 per head minimum for that option... seems a little strange to me. \n\nwe ended up ordering off the a la carte menu, which was fantastic. we opted for:\n\nseared ahi <mark>Tuna Tataki</mark>: yum! each slice of seared ahi tuna was served atop a spinach leave and with a delightful sauce. absolutely delicious. i could have made a meal out of this dish alone (if i didn't have to share...hehe).\n\notsumami - blistered shishito peppers, edamame and <mark>Green Bean Tempura</mark>: we originally planned to order a standard edamame bowl, but we followed our server's recommendation to order this instead. so glad we did! the dish was a perfect portion for 5 hungry people. a few in our group hadn't tried shishito peppers before, so they were absolutely wowed. the tempura was decent - not mindblowing by any standards, but definitely not oily or soggy like some other tempura variations.\n\nlima roll: this roll was fantastic. i like tempura shrimp when it's not in sushi, and this roll definitely changed my mind on that - it was absolutely delicious.\n\namazonia roll: our vegetarian friend loved this roll. it's wonderful that sushisamba has this option, since the <mark><mark>Osetra Caviar Imperial 20g</mark> 20g</mark>, sweet potato and cucumber rolls can get a little boring for our herbivore friends.\n\nsao paolo roll: my personal favorite! extremely delicious. such an amazing combination of flavors and textures. \n\nsomehow, we all had room for dessert and opted for the mango tres leites cake. it was served with a dollop of mango ice cream and a matcha green tea dipping sauce. overall, a truly delicious end to a fantastic meal. i can't wait to visit the sushisamba in new york!", 
            "amazing! came here at 8:30 on a wednesday night for my birthday dinner in vegas. i wish i remembered our serves name but he was excellent. super informative on the menu. i ordered a dirty martini and my friend their cucumber cocktail. my martini was perfect but my friends cucumber cocktail was delicious!! due to going out after dinner that night i didn't want to stuff myself so i ordered only the yamato roll and an order of salmon sashimi. i was between the <mark>El Topo</mark> roll and the yamato, my server suggested the yamato even though their <mark>El Topo</mark> is a trademarked roll that has a great following. the yamato roll consists of tuna, <mark>Foie Gras</mark>, <mark><mark>Osetra Caviar Imperial 20g</mark> 20g</mark> gold leaf...it was delicious. best sushi roll i've ever had and further more one of the best things i've had to eat. my friend had another roll i can't recall the name of (consisted of crab and shrimp) but she loved hers as well..and that is coming from someone who's only had a veggie sushi roll one other time and was very skeptical ordering it. for dessert they brought me out a mango ice cream cake pop looking dessert with a candle lit up, on the house!!! so nice of them to do that for my birthday. the manager came over to us and every table to check to see how everything was. without a doubt i will be back here for the great service, amazing food and perfect atmosphere of trendy but not stuffy. thanks for making my birthday dinner great sushisamba!!!",

(aunny d. explained it perfectly) the place is just fricken nice, beautifully decorated and the perfect hang out spot. they hired very attractive hostesses that were extremely friendly. the service we received from our waiter and the staff was simply awesome. \n\nnow for the food.....\n\nwe had a party of 5 and our original plan was to order both <mark><mark>Osetra Caviar Imperial 20g</mark> 20g</mark>($100) and the sushi samba omakase ($80). after going through the menu, we decided to order up a variety of items rather than go with the omakase. this way, you end up getting food that would be in the omakase anyway, more food (omakase 7 -course), and for less. \n\n\"small plates\" and \"seviches & tiraditos\"  (<mark>Grade A5</mark> a to f)\n\n<mark>Tuna Tataki</mark>  - (c+) chef overuses tatsoi that practically kills the dish\n\nseared kobe beef -(f) just not worth it. mushrooms overwhelms it\n\nchicharron de calamar - (a) excellent and generous amount!\n\nsashimi seviches - (b) grapefruit juice, jalape\\u00f1o, almond + \npassionfruit,  cucumber, cilantro \n\nsashimi tiraditos - (d) yellowtail jalape\\u00f1o and lemongrass + salmon orange and mustard miso\n\nsushi is obviously the trendy thing to have on a restaurants menu. sushi samba serves up some of the most below average sashimi and sushi. for $33, we had the <mark>Samba Sushi</mark> and sashimi combo. the sashimi was nice and thick.  both salmon and yellowtail were quite good, but the tuna was poorly prepared and lacked any freshness. the sushi was a complete joke. you get a small wafer thin slice of sashimi on a rabbit dropping sized glob of rice. most japanese restaurants, for any combo sushi plate, give you two pieces each - tuna, salmon, and yellowtail. sushi samba gives you one. my whole table thought this was a complete joke and ripoff. it doesnt end here....we ordered 4 different rolls. guess what? they're all puny and only have 4 pieces averaging $10-$20 each. we also ordered the 5 hand roll special ($28) which was okay, but the soy wrap just doesnt work. \n\nnow here's how we felt that the chefs were completely lazy or inexperienced. the sushi rice had no vinegar flavor and that is a must for sushi rice. plus, they used old rice because we had some hard dried pieces in our rolls. overall, i would not waste any money on sushi here. it's a complete insult to customers. \n\nour final dish was the 5 meat churrasco: grilled hanger steak, ribeye, pork tenderloin, chorizo, ling\\u00fci\\u00e7a with malagueta pepper oil and chimichurri.  - this dish was fantastic. the meat, cooked medium, was tender and juicy. (a+)\n\nnow, we had a total of about 16-17 items of various things off the menu. more than double than what you'll get in a omakase.  we had about 5 bottles of japanese beers. our cost  per person was $92 with tax and tip included. (5 people) \n\ni would love to come back just for the atmosphere and the churrasco. its simply a cool place to hang out and drink. dont come here for the japanese food. go to a real japanese restaurant for the omakase. just seeing how the sushi, sashimi, and rolls are prepared makes me question the chef's experience in preparing a true omakase.  \n\nif you actually read this whole thing. thanks!", 
            "waiting for my friends at the bar located near their entrance, i had a good feeling about this place.  it had all the bells and whistles of a nice upscale restaurant with a friendly bartender to start.  unfor<mark>Tuna</mark> my good feeling about this place was short lived as our party was seated.\n\nour reservation was for 9:15 pm sunday night.  we didn't get seated until 9:45 pm despite having our whole party there by 9:00 pm.  i didn't care too much for this considering the place was moderately busy on a holiday weekend, and we weren't on a strict schedule.  so i let this roll easily off my back.\n\nas we were seated, we were greeted by our waiter who was terribly unenthusiastic about his job.  he was considerate about asking  for food allergies.  beyond that, all levels of consideration or customer service for that matter stopped there.  granted, he warned us that our food would come out infrequently, but little did we know it would delay our dinner by over an hour.  a little honesty would have been greatly appreciated.  it took forever for most of our food to come out.  we didn't have utensils or place settings even after our food was delivered.  my friend even asked for the manager, to complain about our horrible service, or lack thereof.  the manager's response was something like: \"things are are a bit backed-up, we'll give you free dessert.\"  now, i don't care how backed-up your kitchen is... that's still no excuse for horrible and incompetent service!  dessert only puts a band-aid on a broken arm... why the hell do restaurant managers  do this?  we are not looking to get something free, we just want to make sure they get their act together... and fast!\n\nour original waiter rarely came to our table after we ordered our food.  another waitress came to our aid who was very helpful and attentive to our needs.  she was very friendly and courteous, it's unfor<mark>Tuna</mark> she wasn't our original waiter because this review would've been completely different.\n\nour unpleasant waiter did the weirdest thing.  as my friend was talking to the manager, being very open about our waiters horrible service, our waiter stood by our table as he refolded all our used napkins, tossing them onto our table.  yes, our used clothe napkins.  who does that?  in front of a party that is pretty disgusted by you no less.  it seemed as if he knew he was already in hot water and didn't give a rats-ass about making up for it.  in addition, he circled the portion of our bill they decided to discount for the unsatisfied service in a stuck-up negative manner.  in hind site, my friend said we should have taken that same pen, in front of our waiter, and scratched out his tip!  of course, we're better than that.\n\nthe food is the only reason why this place is not getting a single star. the food was actually quite good with a variety of <mark>Uni</mark> asian-fusion plates.  i ordered the chicken teriyaki (exotic right?) which was much more than i bargained for.  for such a simple dish, it had a variety of <mark>Uni</mark> flavors with a side of extras that complimented each bite.  my friends ordered an array of food that looked just as good, and was commented on just the same.\n\nfor me, customer service will make or break any experience, no matter how good the food is.  in this case, their service failed horribly.  our party ended up with a waiter that was a few cans short of a six pack regarding personality, who would probably fare better as a chippendale's greeter than a restaurant waiter.  i hope management recognizes this and hires waiters that are actually qualified to interact with human beings.", 
            "modern chic fusion restaurant in the new palazzo hotel, featuring brazilian and japanese food. the interior much reminded me of social house in treasure island, dark and swanky. the small plates are meant for sharing, but the tab adds up quick. the server proclaimed their sake menu as the largest in the country, but unfor<mark>Tuna</mark> we didn't get to try any.\n\nwe had the <mark><mark>Assortment of Four</mark></mark> sashimi which were nice and fresh with delicate flavors. my favorite was the tuna with granny smith apple, serrano, and lime.\n\nthe <mark>Hamachi Kama</mark> (yellowtail cheek) was as good as i've had, but missing the grated daikon that it <mark><mark>Osetra Caviar Imperial 20g</mark> 20g</mark> comes with.\n\nchicken liver anticuchos (two skewers served over <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark>) were very livery. i expected them to be only lightly livery, like my favorite pho ga place serves up, not sure if it's due to the prep or the <mark>Grade A5</mark> liver or what.\n\nwe also tried a couple rolls, the <mark>Neo Tokyo</mark> with yellowfin tuna, tempura flake, aji panca. i liked this one more than the bobo brazil with seared kobe beef, avocado, kaiware, shiso, red onion, chimichurri. the kobe beef looked raw rather than seared, maybe seared would have brought out the flavors a bit. both rolls were pretty good though.\n\nthe standout of the meal was the <mark>Berkshire Pork Belly</mark> butterscotch miso, which was meltingly tender, with a subtle sweetness contrasting the richness of the luscious pork.\n\nwe also tried the little tiny crabs we saw in an ad, sawagani, which are flash fried japanese river crabs. these were literally tiny, and the small bite had a texture like an egg shell, with a flavor best described as a subtle fish sauce.\n\ncome here if you have an appetite for a variety of small bites with delicate but well thought out flavors.", 
            "i agree with the reviews below, they did a great job of explaining the menu in more detail than i could.  gave this place 4 stars for originality of food and drinks, and the atmosphere.  it was not too dark, not too bright, with artsy decor on the walls and different pictures rotating on projection screens (not pg rated, btw, i saw a breast or two flash by, though there were nice scenic pics in there too.)  they have a club/lounge in the back of the restaurant, which was recommended to us by a dior employee at caesars mall, he said it was a mix of hip hop music and some other music, he went on a saturday.  however, we weren't able to go since it's not open on sundays.\n\nme and two other girlfriends of mine went here late on a sunday nite (sat 10 pm?) and there was no wait.  not that this matters, but an added bonus was that our waiter was hot!  hehe.  anyways, the menu had a lot of things that i had never heard of before, so if you're not used to brazilian / peruvian / japanese food then the staff should be able to explain it all to you before you order.\n\nwe ordered the tuna ceviche and shrimp ceviche for appetizers (see reviews below for details of the dishes i talk about here).  both excellent, and fresh, and a decent-sized portion (about a cereal bowl full), but pricey at around $15-17 each.  we also ordered <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> rolls, which were excellent (the tuna practically melted in our mouths) as well as the bobobrazil roll, which mr. hottie waiter recommended - slices of kobe beef atop a roll with a bunch of good stuff in it that i didn't know (sorry to all you food buffs!).  i think it was a mix of onions?  both very good.\n\nas far as cocktails, i would definitely recommend the chu-cucumber cocktail.  i think that's the name of it.  again, mr. hottie waiter recommended this, which i decided to try even though it didn't sound good at first.  it was surprisingly refreshing!  it has some sort of japanese liquor in it, which supposedly had a lite vodka flavor, as well as roseflower and cucumber.  i ended up having two of these (they were in a martini glass), and the third having substituted the original liquor for gin, as a recommendation by the bartender, which had a stronger alcohol taste to it.  one of my friends tried the samba juice cocktail, which she said was good and tasted a little like sangria.\n\noverall, great atmosphere, a bit pricey, but original food that you wouldn't find at your regular sushi restaurant.  i would definitely try this place at least once on a trip to vegas!  hopefully i'll get to check out the lounge next time!", 
            "i agree with an early reviewer that sushi samba is a pretty nice date place.  the first time i went to sushi samba was back in early august, and my date and i tried the calamari appetizer with plantains and that was tasty.  the big hit of the night though were my nina fresa cocktails and the chocolate fondue.  they were absolutely fabulous! the nina fresa cocktails were nice and fruity and gave me a helluva buzz. ;)\n\ni enjoyed the ambiance of sushi samba so much that i went a second time with my girls during labor day weekend and we were seated in the dining area that later transformed into sugarcane boutique lounge after 11 pm.  our sexy latin waiter, jaiver, was very nice and oh-so-hot too! he was very helpful in explaining to us about the different dishes.  for appetizer, we went with <mark>Tuna Tataki</mark> which was melt in your mouth good! then, for entree, we tried the brazilian churrasco, which was very good too, particularly the dipping sauces that went with the meats.  oh yes, we also ordered the cocktail tree which was awesome! all in all, sushi samba was very nice.  i also love the brazilian/latin infused house music that played while we were dining.  i would definitely go back again!", 
            "more of a 3.5...  although i love trendy, high ceiling restaurants that give you a modern feel..sushi samba's decor is a little too cluttered for me. maybe its because of the fact that its a twist between brazilian, japanese, and peruvian cuisine...where they feel like they need to include all three of the cultures art.. but whatever the case may be, theres just.. too much orange swirls, too many funky paintings, and too many weird faces on their walls. i like more of the simple trends. they play trendy music..which is a plus...but they crank it up as if you're in a club which in turn makes everyone talk louder than usual. it's almost as if you're in a convention. \n\n\nsome of the items that i've tried and have a vivid memory of:\n\n-yellowtail sashimi tiradito. tasted like...yellowtail in salsa. it was good..but it was different. i usually like my sashimis in ponzu sauce.\n\n-mushroom toban-yaki is reallllly good. it comes out in a hot sizzling clay pot with like four of five different kinds of mushrooms. \n\n-<mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> taquito\n\n-robata: \n<mark>Filet Mignon</mark>\n<mark>Lamb Chop</mark>\n<mark>Cherry Tomatoes</mark>\nshiitake mushrooms\n\noysters, uni sashimi. \n\noverall, its not too bad. i like the convenience. the two times i've been here was because i stayed at the palazzo. takes like 5 mins to get here from our room.", 
            "good sushi with a twist. they have some <mark>Uni</mark> flavors and rolls: bobo brazil, yamato (<mark>Foie Gras</mark>, caviar, toro) and a few others. <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> was pretty disappointing.\n\ncareful when ordering the kobe, it's $27 an ounce usually a 5oz minimum. my smart friend ordered 10oz's off the bat thinking it was only $27 total. i am not sure of the name, but the kobe cooked on a hot rock is delicious. worth $150 per order? just for the experience. \n\nif you could gamble $50 a hand on blackjack or pai gow, why not eat it as well?  \n\npros: <mark>Uni</mark> rolls and flavors\n\ncons: very pricey ($2 for wasabi haha), mediocre service both times i went", 
            "my friends and i actually couldn't decide on a place to eat and spontaneously came to sushi samba. we weren't too hungry so didn't get a full dinner. i ordered the pork gyozas (and the kabocha pumpkin pure\\u00e9 underneath was a really nice touch). the gyozas were realllly really good, i still think about them. i also ordered the green envy rolls (tuna, salmon, asparagus, wasabi pea crust with a lime mayo) and although it was good, it wasn't as outstanding as the gyozas. unfor<mark>Tuna</mark> i did not yelp before going, so did not get to try out the fruity drinks that everybody's raving about (sad face). i did share the chocolate fondue with a friend, and it came with the chocolate already melted with no heat element under it, so we took it as a sign that we had to eat it quickly. the dipping mediums were: coconut marshmallows, <mark>Steamed Japanese Rice</mark> crispies, passion fruit cake, chocolate brownie, fruits, and green tea ice cream. overall, i really liked the surroundings, i did feel like it matched up to the vegas environment. it was definitely a fun place for dinner before a night out!",

            "overpriced? yes. small portions? yes. good ambiance? yes.\n\nhubs wanted some sushi and without too much thought i suggested sushi samba.  we were staying at encore so it was a brief walk.  \n\nit was 1:30 on a tuesday so there were many a tradeshow, badge wearing bunch dining here using their corporate credit cards.  if it wasn't for them i think this place would be empty so thank you optic show.\n\nhubs is out of control when it comes to ordering sushi.  he has a taste for it all (unfor<mark>Tuna</mark>).  we had the sushi combination, edamame, unagi sushi, the spicy yellowtail handroll, the carnaval roll, the shrimp & veggie tempura and a variety of a la carte sushi (spanish makerel, amberjack, fatty tuna and striped bass).  our bill including 3 asahis was $142.  that's friggin steep for lunch.\n\nthe next time hubs says he wants sushi for lunch i'll veto it and opt for some noodles at a chinese joint.", 
            "if you are not interested in being open-minded to an array of fusion tapas featuring japanese, brazilian, and peruvian inspired palettes...then this is place not for you. if however you are interested in being more cultured in regards to your typical sushi restaurant, then you may continue reading.\n\nsushi samba is a great restaurant to taste a blend of very <mark>Uni</mark> flavors...the menu is not your typical one but rest assured, your server is happy to answer any of your questions. the server started off by asking us if we've been there before...i have so i said yes. if i would have said now, he would have prefaced our meal with a story of the restaurants background i.e. stylings of food, etc. i know this because i overheard another server doing it. \n\nwith any tapas joint it is always easy to over order...and me, my bro, and his fiance did just that. here is what we got.\n\n-shishito (grilled peppers): the sea salt adds a great flavor, the peppers themselves are literally grilled\n- <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> robata: a small portion of robata grilled <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> cooked exactly how i wanted\n- <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> and miso swewers: recommended by our server, these skewers were off the hook!!!! melted like butter in my mouth...the miso flavor was out of this world.\n-<mark>Miso Soup</mark>: the only difference between this soup and the others...they add cilantro\n-<mark>Coconut Rice</mark>: the side order of rice could actually feed 2 people. we ordered 2 not knowing this. the coconut flavor is not at all overpowering...i've gotta learn how to make this rice!\n-green envy roll: yum!!! salmon and tuna rolled with some crunchies to make this fine number\n-<mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> roll: not as spicy as i thought it would be but still yummy\n-<mark>Rio Grande</mark> (5 meats): this meal on its own came with black beans, collard greens, rice, 5 different meats, and 3 sauce pairings. wow! you need to order this...there was 3 of us and we couldnt finish but the options were great. the sauces were extremely complementary.\n\nsure our meal came out to $172.69 pre gratuity for 3 people but for the service, quality and presentation of the food, and the ambiance...the price seems quite fitting.", 
            "we stopped here for a little lunch during happy hour on our trip.  the atmosphere of this place was awesome, i really liked the decor as well.  a very modern looking establishment.  \n\nthe happy hour menu is limited, but not bad at all.\n\nfor happy hour my wife and i got the <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> roll, a philly roll, <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark> roll, and chicken anticuchos.  i loved the chicken anticuchos.  super tasty, tender pieces of chicken with a nice teriyaki sauce.  the <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> roll was spicy.  spicier than what i'm used to.  i wasn't big on the <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark> mainly because if i'm eating sashimi or rolls, i like it cold. i just dont jive to well on warm sushi haha.  when it comes to warm fish, bbq salmon or halibut is my game.\n\nwe both ordered drinks, i ordered a mojito and the wife had a caiprianha.  the mojito i had wasn't working for me.  it was awesome they put fresh mint in it, but i hated getting foliage in my mouth.  also, it was rather strong.....i like a strong drink trust me, but something was different about the strength of this drink.  same on the caiprianha.  texas de brazil made an awesome caiprianha, so i dont know what was so different between the 2.\n\nwe did end up spending around 50 bucks at happy hour which was a shock.  we did enjoy it, and it is totally worth a stop.", 
            "came here on the reccomendation with chef micheal cressoti and i was impressed. it's located at the top floor of the palazzo with a hip and dark ambiance. okay people it's dark crowded and loud. do you forget where you are?!? it's las vegas people!! this is what you should expect. this is the new era where sushi is supposed to be hip. i took my girfriend and a third wheel there for a dinner and pretty much ordered the omakase. as a person who worked around in sushi restaraunts, lived in peru, and surrounded by brazileros, i still was taught i had alot more to learn about the cuisine and the complex flavors on the palate when mixed together. honestly unless you're ordering the kobe beef roll or the fuie gras sushi... skip the whole sushi list. the rolls are great but for the price, i would opt out for the kitchen orders. <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> was a little different but nothing to make you stand up and dance. the red miso <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> (i believe that was the fish) skewers are to die for. the grill is special grill where they use woodchips brought in from japan. this is the kind of special treatment the chefs use to creats such dishes, so the price is reasonable. all their fish is line caught so for the environmentally conscience, expect to pay more for sushi as opposed to other sushi restaraunts. their ceviche was very light and refreshing, so was the yellowtail sashimi and the ceviche. the kobe beef tacos. sorry kogi was okay for me. asian tacos are as good as it gets, but kobe beef tacos who can possibly resist. it was spectacular with the spicy emulsion that was served on the side. the duck confit with wil mushroom is a must order. succulent morsels of variety of mushrooms and the perfectly cooked medium rare breast of duck just melted in your mouth. the sake sommelier was very friendly and knew her alcohol, so if you are interested in ordering sake ask for the pro. from here and there, after 5 other dishes, we ended up with dessert. the chocolate cake, which they said was great, was rather just good, but the carrot cake. i hate carrot cake, but the pastry chef, she whippped up something so magical and delicious. not too sweet, not too heavy, not too bready... if you can understand what i mean, you will love this cake. in a cake, i look for the perfect balance of sweetness and richness, that will just top off your great meal. not to overwhelm your palate and your stomach but make a nice closure to the expensive meal you just enjoyed. it was the best carrot cake i've had. overall the staff was friendly and the general manager was kind enough to explain to me about the food and the kitchen, since i work in the kitchen as well. i left there extremely happy and with an impressed gf and third wheel. thank you sushi samba.", 
            "what is there not to love about brazilians?\n\nbrazilian bbq, brazilian wax, brazilian models, and brazilian fusion.\n\nsushi samba is ahhh-mazing. i honestly thought the bf was overhyping the place and thought it would be mediocre, but i was surprised by the quality of the food and how delicious everything was!\n\nour waitress regina was nice and very bubbly. she made our dining experience at sushi samba great. instead of ordering random items off the menu, we chose the personalized prix fixe menu. basically, you tell your waiter/waitress what you like/dislike and the price limit per person and they basically bring out items that they think you would like.  if you don't like it, the waiter/waitress takes full responsibility for it and doesn't charge you. \n\nbetween the 3 of us, we had:\n- edamame: i'm not a fan of edamame so i rarely eat it and don't really care for it.\n- yellowtail crispy taquitos: this is a cold dish and it's like a sushi taco. the taquito had lemongrass, avocado, and aji panca miso. definitely recommend it!\n- <mark>Tuna Tataki</mark>: also another cold dish. very light and it had white asparagus, heart of palm, avocado, tatsoi, and citrus soy. i love anything with tuna in it so i enjoyed this a lot. \n- mushroom toban yaki w/ <mark>Filet Mignon</mark>: omg delicious! this came in a stone pot and had a bunch of <mark>Mixed <mark>Wild Mushrooms</mark></mark> and <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> in a delicious broth. \n- sashimi tiradito (yellowtail, kanpachi, tuna, and salmon): i didn't care too much for this dish. it was good but some of the sauce that accompanied the sashimi didn't blow me away. the yellowtail had a jalapeno and lemongrass sauce, the kanpachi had a yuzu, black truffle oil, and sea salt sauce, the tuna had a yuzu soy, hickory oil, and toasted garlic sauce, and the salmon had a maiz cancha, lime zest, and ponzu sauce. \n- <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> w/ a side of <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark>: this had to be one of the best <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> i've ever had in my life. it was cooked perfectly and had the perfect buttery, melt in your mouth texture. it was also marinated in a sweet sauce, but it wasn't too overpowering. the side of corn complemented the <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> very well.\n- <mark>Neo Tokyo</mark> roll, carnival roll, <mark>El Topo</mark> roll - i'm not the biggest fan of rolls and these rolls were a bit disappointing. especially since it came out last after all the really delicious dishes. i tried each of the rolls, but they weren't memorable.\n- carrot cake: oooooommmmmmmgggggggg! best carrot cake, ever. it was served with brown butter ice cream, cinnamon cream, rainbow carrot chip, and orange reduction. i seriously wanted to lick the plate after i was done!\n\nthe total per person (not including alcohol, tip, or tax) was about $65/per person. totally worth it! \n\nif you ever decide to try sushi samba, skip the rolls and go for the good stuff! i definitely recommend the personalized prix fixe menu.", 
            "wish i could give this place a 5 because the food is delicious, but unfor<mark>Tuna</mark> because of the lousy service i have to give it 3 stars. went to this restaurant with a few girlfriends on a trip to vegas. super excited to enjoy a great sushi meal with people that love sushi. instead we were greeted by a server, name to be disclosed, who was degrading, rude, and treated us like cheap girls. \n\none of our friends requested for a carafe of hot sake and this server immediately said that this restaurant was too high class to have any sort of hot sake. who was this guy? how does he not know that we're just girls who enjoy drinking hot sake from time to time-this server needs to learn some major restaurant etiquette! as the night progressed, the service did not get any better. i've been to many wonderful restaurants in vegas where the food was great and the service even better and this restaurant definitely put the standard of vegas restaurants in the low range. for<mark>Tuna</mark> the manager hooked my friends and i with some shots that were delicious - one of them included cucumber and was fresh and cool to the taste. \n\non the positive note, the food was ridiculously delicious (hoping there wasn't any extra protein hidden in it). the sashimi dishes with granny apple sauce and another with some sort of lemon grass sauce was soo good! the chilean <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> was delectable and probably the best dish on the menu. \n\ni always believe that las vegas has the best places to eat, this restaurant may be one of them, but i will never go there again unless i confirm that this server is not serving my table. and if anyone from this restaurant is reading this...never underestimate your customers!",

(you may ask why i went in the first place -- i was actually interested in brazilian food for dinner; i misunderstood the theme of the restaurant as there were no brazilian food offerings).", 
            "sushisamba...... where do we start????   ok, lets start with the first thing that was delivered... its my neverfail when i go for sushi....  <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> roll....   even if the tuna isnt the highest of quality somewhere, the <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> roll isnt half bad because of the spicy mayo.....   ok...   sushi samba version is hands down the absolute best <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> roll i have ever had..   woah, time to calm down about it....  the sushi roll literally melted in my mouth, the tuna was uber fresh, the spicy mayo was applied in moderation let his presence be known....   this thing was absolute perfection....  everything else we ordered was great, not to the perfection level of the <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> roll, but it was still great.  wayyyyy better than good.  had some yellowtail roll, oh yeah a $36 kobe beef sashimi roll with some deliciousness baked into it, <mark><mark>Jumbo Shrimp</mark></mark> - straight from the ocean fresh...   some japanese beer, some of this some of that, an hour later and $200 tab we emerged with smiles from ear to ear....   i had always heard good things about the place, but until i experienced it for myself, could never truly know how great it actually is.  i will be going back shortly, even if its only to order the <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> roll...   i would trust that everything they have there would be to the quality in which i encountered in my meal.... fear not yelpers... this place will treat you right....", 
            "sushi samba is pretty tucked away in the palazzo, the atmosphere is ok, service and bartenders were friendly and nice at the bar, and the food is pretty decent too.  it's also great that they have a happy hour menu from 4-7 sun-fri, but... my only gripe is that it's not really a happy hour menu if you discount items and then serve them 1/2 size, which is what i expect was happening since our portions were teeny tiny, the drinks were served in small glasses and then i saw the normal pint-size glasses that the same drinks were being made in to take to the tables. the mojitos were bomb though. \n\nthat said... the food was actually pretty good. we had the <mark>Salt and Pepper Squid</mark> (yummy!), <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> roll (small, and could've been spicier, but still good), chicken skewers, some others, and i also tried the japan relief roll (all the money goes to japan relief ppl, order it!) which was also really tasty - combo of <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark>, eel, wrapped in a soy paper wrap. \n\nit wasn't a bad way to spend $80 (esp in vegas) but again, if you're going to advertise specials for happy hour, they should actually be specials, not just 1/2 the plate for 1/2 the price. nothing special 'bout that.", 
            "this place continues to impress!  this time while i was there i ran into a fellow elite member which was both shocking and awesome!   i got the <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> roll again and my friend ordered the <mark>Neo Tokyo</mark> roll....  based on my previous review you know that i am a huge fan of the <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> roll, and now you will know how much i loved the <mark>Neo Tokyo</mark> roll... this has yellowfin tuna, tempura flake and aji panca and it is just purely fantastic.  there was so much going on with this roll that it hit you in layers.  with each one, i found something else that i liked even more about it.  if you are going here, these two rolls should be your top two.", 
            "maybe it's because i've enjoyed many a meal at the sushi samba locations in nyc, and maybe because i was a little hungover from the previous nights festivities, but i was not overly wowed by lunch here with two of my lady loves with whom i was vacationing. \n\none thing that is always a priority on vacation is food. it has to be, this is a break from the mundane life i leave behind, so why do i want to eat my standard weekly fare of life in the working world? i love sushi and because of it's nutritious nature figured this would be a great way to replenish all things lost to bottomless cocktails and greasy late night foods. i didn't partake in the consumption of any libations at lunch, but did hear that the mojito was pretty stellar.\n\ni ordered the trio <mark>Seaweed Salad</mark> that came beautifully presented on a three trayed dish of hijiki, wakame, and my favorite aka-tosaka. each were lightly dressed with lemon and sidelined with some tomato caviar. not terrible for a $11, but not overly substantial either. for lunch i ordered <mark>Yellowtail Jalapeno</mark> which was ok if not a little heavy on the jalapeno, and a <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> that was all sorts of bland. i think i would have been happier enjoying these as a happy hour because it seems that the prices are a little easier to swallow for the quality of the food. i didn't order anything complex, and maybe they just let the \"easy\" stuff slide, but i wasn't terribly enthused enough to want to go back and give it a second shot to see just how good the rest of the menu is according to the higher ratings given.", 
            "i came back to sushi samba over memorial day weekend and loved it so much that i actually ate there twice. the service and staff are incredible. everyone is really nice, especially the ladies at the bar. the happy hour menu is such a great deal too, $6 for everything (i think there's at least 8 different items to choose from, including 2 different drinks. i recommend the mojito). i loved the <mark>Salt and Pepper Squid</mark> (a better version of fried calamari), <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> roll, and the yellowtail seviche (it had a really nice ginger flavor to it). the kobe beef tacos were also amazing. as i mentioned in my previous review, the portions are not the biggest, but when you factor in that this is vegas, you are actually getting pretty good bang for your buck. \n\nthey should use maybe brighter lights inside though, it's kind of tucked away and easy to miss, in my opinion. people need to see this place!! :) \n\ngreat prices, great service. i will definitely be back! thanks sushi samba!", 
            "i don't believe it is possible to give a better rating.  we went to vegas for my wife's birthday.  the was our last night, and we wanted to go out for the last time.  we had already eating diner a couple of hours before hand.  so we figured we would go for a late night snack.  we went to sushi samba, and could not have made a better decision.\n\nwe were pretty indecisive about what to order.  so our waitress suggested that we answer a few of her questions, and she would suggest a meal for us.  that was perfect.  we had the yellow tail tacos which was delicious.  very light, and refreshing.  then we had the <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> skewers.  amazing sauce, and was great.  then we ended up with the <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark>.  great meal.  great suggestions.\n\nbut the topper was the owner liz.  she came over to our table.  she was very welcoming, and actually talked to us.  i didn't feel as if she was doing it, as part of some shtick.  she was very genuine.  which was cool. \n\nwe ended the night with a vanilla chocolate cake for my wife's birthday.  overall great experience.  when we go back to vegas.  this will definitively be one of our stops.", 
            "my friends and i came here for happy hour.  \n\nthere wasn't much room at the bar, but i found a single table in the bar.  i asked the hostess if we could sit there and she said yes but we had to order from the bar. i asked the hostess for menus and after she told me i had to order from the bar she said someone would be there to help me. errr...ok? my friend didn't hear any of this, but the bartender was nice and said instead of having us go up to the bar, she would have a waiter serve us.  the waiter who came was also really nice.\n\ni ordered a veggie tempura and <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> roll. the veggie tempura roll was one of the bigger dishes there and was pretty good. it came with a <mark><mark>Osetra Caviar Imperial 20g</mark> 20g</mark> and a creamy tangy sauce.  the <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> roll had really weird rice.  it was smashed together and wasn't sushi rice.  i'm not sure that it was even <mark>Steamed Japanese Rice</mark>.  i know this is a fusion restaurant but please don't f up sushi rice! \n\n3 stars might seem a little harsh for bad rice, but as a whole, i guess i just wasn't that impressed.  it wasn't bad, but it was def. a'ight.",

            "my wife and i really liked sushi samba and their fushion menu.  we were running late for a show and couldn't wait to be seated in the main restaurant so we sat at the bar at the edge of the restaurant and the mall area as soon as something opened up.  lara s was our main waitress plus another girl and she was very friendly and helpful in selecting our drinks and menu items.  my wife and i are big st. germaine liquor fans and we loved the \"chu-cumber\" drink.  also thought the tempura green bean appetizer with truffle aioli sauce was yummie.  we had a sampling of sushi and pacific, <mark>El Topo</mark>, and <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> rolls and all was very good.", 
            "this was our go to late night place while staying at the venetian. we opted to sit at the bar and try their happy hour specials along with a few things off their menu.\n\ni woud highly recommend the miso chilean <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>, as it was once of the best i have ever had. the vegetables that came with it were so tender and delicious, even though i hate brussels sprouts, the rest were quite good.\n\nthe <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> rolls were really good also, though small compared to other places i've had them.\n\nthe best vegetable dish i've had in a long time were the collard greens in an asian dressing. they were crunchy and filling enough for two. though, next time i'm not sharing! \n\nanother stand out to me were the fried plantains. normally, restaurants cut them thick and serve them with sides of beans and sour cream. i loved that these were cut thin and lightly breaded, deep fried and sprinkled only with some shavings of cheese. \n\nbesides the <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>, the items we got were only $5-6 bucks a dish and easily can be split by two. this was probably my favorite place to dine while there and probably one of the better late night dining options you have if you don't feel like burgers or sandwiches.\n\ni would have loved to give them a full 5 stars but the bar people were much to slow in not only forgetting to ask our order but forgetting to bring us our drinks after having to ask  three times, while serving those who just sat down right away. otherwise, the food was fantastic!",

            "this restaurant caught my eye because it was something out of the ordinary from your typical sushi restaurant. the menu offered an intriguing variety but when i began reading the reviews i knew i had to try it. i would suggest anyone going there for the first time to try the dining experience because you may think you know what you want but the chef knows better! the server asks if there is anything you do not like or if you have any food allergies and then how much money per person you're looking to spend. there are options anywhere from $50 per person to $130 per person if kobe beef if something that interests you. as it was for a special occasion we opted for $80 per person and even though thats more than i have probably ever spent on a single meal there were no regrets.\n\ncourse #1 consisted of berkshire pork gyoza which is basically pork dumplings in a pumpkin puree and yellowtail ceviche taquitos, both of which were absolutely delicious and not necessarily something i would have ordered on my own.\n\ncourse #2 was yellowtail sashimi in a spicy peruvian sauce with a slice of red jalapeno on top and octopus sashimi in a japanese citrus sauce which again were both to die for!\n\ncourse #3 had an array of <mark>Filet Mignon</mark>, <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>, <mark>Alaskan King Crab</mark> and <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark>. all were moist and tender but the <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> absolutely melted in your mouth! <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark> was a yummy alternative to <mark><mark>Osetra Caviar Imperial 20g</mark> 20g</mark> as well.\n\nfinally, course #4 was the main sushi dinner. <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark> rolls were delicious, but the <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> with i believe tuna on top was absolutely amazing! there was also <mark>Half Maine Lobster</mark> and another roll which i believe had lobster in it as well and was probably the only thing of the entire dinner that i was not absolutely amazed with, but it was still good!\n\nanother great thing about this place is they tell you if there is anything throughout this meal you do not like they will take it back and bring you something else! as our server said, \"its like a money back guarantee!\"\n\nanyways this is definitely a place i would tell everyone who loves trying new things to try or even just the sushi lover. do it! it will not disappoint!\n\nonly part i would complain about is the fact that there is not one in california!!!",

            "their signature roll saved them from a 2 star review.  reading the reviews and consistency of solid reviews, i thought i found the spot!  once there, the overpriced menu and sake list reminded me i was in vegas, a place that should not have to be this expensive, i mean come on, people are handing money hand over fist at the tables, don't gouge us at the restaurants.  nigiri was priced per piece at a rate higher than i'm used to paying for 2 pieces.  the rolls were decent, i liked the <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> version they served, a little <mark>Uni</mark>, the eel avocado was good.  my main complaint is that they are a decent sushi spot, nothing extraordinary, and their prices are simply too high.  however, the samba roll, with <mark>Half Maine Lobster</mark>, mango and some other delightful flavors that created a party on my palate, bumped them to 3 stars.  great roll, $19, but that one was special.", 
            "i almost want to give this a 5. near oh my god moment, but not quite.\n\nthis is a little misleading. i swear this came up under \"chinese\" on yelp while we were looking for something (in a group <mark><mark>Assortment of Four</mark></mark>) but this is definitely not chinese. it's japanese brazilian fusion, which i had never had, but was awesome. the menu is a bid daunting, but the waitress offered to bring out a tasting menu for us, based on the common questions like, \"are you ok with raw fish,\" \"do you have allergies,\" \"how do you eat red meat,\" etc. this was helpful - usually i'm not fazed by the large menu, but for some reason i was having problems focusing. worth mentioning they say up front that they'll take back anything we don't like, no charge, and they do ask for a budget to keep them in line.\n\nwhat we got was really pretty exceptional. gyoza steamed and pan fried, hamachi taquitos (not what you're thinking - not the deep fried rolls, but little taco shells filled with hamachi sashimi), seared tuna with baby greens and crunchy salt, and portabella fries with kabocha aioli. all sounds fancy, all really good.\n\nthen a warm plate - grilled <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> with a sweet glaze, <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> (not their a5 w<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark>, which we were offered for an upcharge, but declined) and <mark><mark>Alaskan King Crab</mark> Leg</mark>, all with a side of elote. the bass was good - tender and flaky, and i like the glaze. but it was crazy overpowered by the beef and crab. firstly, the beef was far superior to what we had at n9ne. tender, flavorful, and with a great salt and pepper crust on the outside, served with a little pile of powdered chile for dipping. and the crab was that near oh my god moment. an *enormous* <mark><mark>Alaskan King Crab</mark> Leg</mark>, brushed with a sort of thick butter sauce, served piping hot. wow, this was exceptional. and while i guess i should expect it, points to the restaurant for realizing that serving a filet and a <mark><mark>Alaskan King Crab</mark> Leg</mark> family style to diners that have only chopsticks required that you slice things up in to nice little bite sized pieces.\n\nfinally, sushi. their <mark>Neo Tokyo</mark> roll, which is their version of the <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark>, a hamachi roll with spicy crab and avocado on top, a tuna roll with asparagus, dusted with wasabi, and an assortment of sashimi and nigiri. as well as a hot roll - something covered in melted mozzarella, crispy onions and a sweet sauce. all of the cold rolls were good - i especially liked their <mark>Neo Tokyo</mark> roll. the sashimi was also very good, but the hot roll...i could do without. it was in interesting twist - not just the cheese was hot, but the entire roll, rice and all. however, the cheese and a heaping helping of onion and sauce overpowered whatever might have been inside. this was about the only misstep i could find.\n\nthe atmosphere is odd - lots of pounding techno music, along with an odd video collage (on many many video screens) of brazilian beach babes, bullet trains, brazilian slums, and japanese salarymen trudging to their soul-murdering jobs. not sure what they were going for. but whatever.\n\ngreat spot - chinese though it wasn't, we all were appropriately full when it was over (not hungry, no stuffed) and we all agreed we'd be back. the total bill, excluding drinks, was probably about $65 per person. i loved the mix of appetizers, hot beef and seafood, and sushi. if you're going with a group, this is a fun way to try stuff without having to worry about reading a menu.", 
            "the sushi was good, not great, just good.  unfor<mark>Tuna</mark>, i've paid a lot less for much better.  3 stars because this restaurant is clever with menu items and decor, but nestled in the heart of a massive casino full of tourists and prices to boot. this place kind of reminds me of a jefferson airplane video, dark, yet colorful.  the wait staff were very friendly, but inattentive for an early dinner service.", 
            "i wanted to do happy hour before a night of binge drinking so i decided to make reservations at sushi samba for me and my 5 girlfriends. on the reservations site i was told that happy hour was served throughout the restaurant which sounded perfect because we had a big party and we all know how crowded the bar area can get. however, once we arrived, we were told it was at the bar area only. whomp. the bar area is super small but we managed to snag a little table and squeeze all of our bodies around it. not the most comfortable seating, but it'll have to do.\n\nwe ordered everything on their happy hour menu. all the dishes were about $5 and we wanted to try everything. unfor<mark>Tuna</mark> our waitress came back 3 times just to tell us that they \"no longer had this item on their happy hour menu\". bogus! i asked why and she told me that their menu is ever changing and since we came on the last day of the month, \"they ran out of ingredients\". really?!  so instead of eating, we decided to just drink and ate whatever few things they did have on happy hour. we ordered some rolls off their regular menu and they were all lacking. a $16 roll with only 4 pieces? kind of ridiculous, wouldn't you agree? and it wasn't even all that. we left hungry and disappointed. luckily we were buzzed so we got over it rather quickly.", 
            "go different, go sushi samba\n\nmust-haves: la robata [b+], brazilian corn [b], bobo brazil [b]\nskip: <mark>Neo Tokyo</mark> [d] way overrated \n\nyeah this is place is expensive but it's worth it. \n\nfirst of all i have to say that i love fusion food if it's done right. there is definitely something alluring about mixing flavors from different cultures. when i heard that sushi samba fuses japanese, brazilian and peruvian, i dropped everything and made a reservation.\n\ninside, sushi samba will have you in awe before you even taste the food. the interior d\\u00e9cor is modern but definitely has a south american flare.  we need more places like this in vegas!\n\nservice is unfor<mark>Tuna</mark> hit or miss. this place often gets very busy and servers sometimes struggle to handle the crowd.\n\nthe food selection is very impressive. don't bother with generic food that you can get anywhere. try something new! there are so many interesting and delicious options to pick from...be adventurous!\n\n\nfood: a- | service: c- | selection: a | experience: b+ | overall:  b",

            "i'm back bitches!  \n\nunfor<mark>Tuna</mark>, the review that i chose my return on isn't a glowing five star, but a glowering 1 star.\n\nthe only meal i ate in vegas for 3 days ( i kid you not) was friday not at this place.  it came highly recommended by numerous friends, so i thought this should be some great sushi.  \n\nboy was i mistaken. \n\nfirstly, we had a 10pm reservation.  we arrived at 9:45 thinking we'll grab a seat at the bar and sip on a cocktail and people watch at all the bachelorette parties, etc.  well, 45 mins later and we still didn't have a table.  my stomach was growling, and my face was scowling at this point.  \n\nthe hostess was rude when we would ask how much longer for a table, she would just say, you're next.  really? i'm next you said that 10 people ago??!!\n\nwhen we finally got our seats, we ordered the following:\n\n--rock shrimp:  it was tempura battered.  the first few bites were good, but as everything began to cool, it just became mushy.  \n\n--fusion sushi roll was boring, bland and well, you get the point\n\n--the only thing that was excellent was the <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>. it was moist, delicate and absolutely delicious.  but, $25 for 2 skewers left me wanting.  \n\nthe <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark> was awful..\n\nthe restaurant itself is everything that you would expect from vegas. upscale, trendy and expensive.  $200 for three items and 4 cocktails.  not worth my only eating experience in vegas that weekend.", 
            "1)the chilean <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> was quite possibly the best piece of fish i've ever had the pleasure of eating.\n\n2)the coffee is excellent, and is served in cool glasses.\n\n3) the ceviche is okay, but not what i would expect from a high-end fusion restaurant\n\n4) the service?  well, if the service was anywhere close to the quality of the <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>, i'd easily give it five stars.  unfor<mark>Tuna</mark>, the wait staff seemed overwhelmed by what i would think would be an average number of customers.  if they can get that down (and they should be able to, it *is* las vegas, after all), then i can see it being one of the better easy-entry restaurants on the strip.", 
            "i do not miss this place every time i go to lv.... it never disappoints... ever!!! unfor<mark>Tuna</mark> my favorite dish is the hot rock that is served where you self cook the amazing steak... the sauces are to die for!!! it is very pricey though... but well worth it... also the <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> kabobs you cannot miss!!", 
            "my mother and i are came here last sunday for happy hour.  the sushi was absolutely delicious- fresh with decent portion sizes.  we particularly liked that they don't use a lot of rice  in lieu of other ingredients like many sushi restaurants. we tried several dishes from the happy hour menu at $6 each:\n\n<mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> roll - good not not too different from other <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> rolls we tried\n<mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark> roll - good portions of <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark> and not too greasy\nsalmon sushi - great flavor with asparagus.  this was my mother's favorite.\njapanese style <mark>Salt and Pepper Squid</mark> - a bit salty but quite tasty.  small portion.\nyellowtail seviche- two thinly sliced yellowtail with a tasty spicy sauce.  this was my favorite.\n\nin addition, we ordered the california roll which was $14.  however,  they used real crab instead of imitation crab.  it was quite tasty with generous amounts of crab used.  \n\nthe service was good.  the restaurant itself is dark with several televisions positioned around- they don't show sports just a program about sushi.  it would be even better if they had a television at the bar for sports.",

            "oh. my. god. i want to eat here every day of my life, if only for the ishi yaki. my wallet is already throwing a fit about the thought of how quickly i would go broke, but akdsjhfakjldhf. words cannot describe how much i want to go back and eat all the things. well more specifically, all the ishi yaki.\n\nin reality though, sushisamba is unfor<mark>Tuna</mark> a sometimes food (unless you're a bajillionaire, in which case, dine on! i will live vicariously through you). it's just too expensive for me, as a student to afford. thank goodness someone else was picking up the check when i went.\n\nmy family and i had our christmas dinner here at like... 9pm (yea, we did christmas in vegas). it was by far, the fanciest christmas dinner i have ever had. \n\nwe were seated in the back room area since we had a relatively large party, but since it was so late, it was mostly empty there, which was simultaneously nice and eery. our waiter suggested we do the tasting menu, where he and the chef craft our meal for us, but since my mom had just been here with some colleagues the week before, we decided to just let her order for us, since she knew what was good. \n\n- <mark>Salt and Pepper Squid</mark>: the seasoning made this extra delicious-- a really good starter\n- crispy yellowtail taquitos: also yummy, though i may be biased because yellowtail is one of my favorite fish; very lime-y\n- <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark>: a twist on regular tempura, but absolutely delicious; if you don't like spicy mayo, maybe not your thing\n- ishi yaki: words cannot describe. <mark>Grade A5</mark>5 japanese waygu that you cook yourself on a hot japanese river stone? yes, please! you take a slice of meat, dip it in oil, and then put it on the hot stone to let it cook. there's a few different dipping sauces and three different types of salt that you can add to your meat. all of them are delicious, though i am partial to the black salt. there were some pears on the plate, so i was like what the heck, why not cook those on the stone too. still delicious. even thinking about this is making me crave it. the ishi yaki is really expensive, but if you're going to go for any of the japanese waygu options, go for this one because it is definitely the most <mark>Uni</mark>.\n- we ordered a bunch of sushi rolls, which were good, but not the most amazing ones i've ever had.\n- also, the lychee bubbletail is really good. the alcohol is not overpowering, it's not too sweet, and they put a real lychee (probably from a can) in it.\n\nrandom: i really like the music on their website... that probably sounds really weird, but it's true. love it.\n\ntl;dr: i know for a fact that the main reason why i love sushisamba as much as i do is because i was not paying. it was a crazy expensive meal, but it was delicious because we ordered some rather expensive (but good! oh so very good!) things. if you're not willing to splurge, you'll probably think i'm crazy for giving them a 5-star review, but if you are, be prepared to be amazed. just don't think about the check. and get the ishi taki. 5-stars for that alone.", 
            "a pretty good sushi spot in vegas. it is really pricy for the kind of rolls, but you can tell everything is very fresh and has a lot of flavor. we got a yellow-tail roll, a custom crab and lobster roll, the sushisamba roll, and a <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> roll, also a plate of chicken teriyaki. the sushi for the most part was really good! the chicken teriyaki was decent, but nothing all that amazing considering it cost $26 for that plate. the servers are very informative on the dishes and are super friendly. they offer good advice and are pretty quick to serve. if you ask for the chef to make a custom roll with crab and lobster, the creations are usually really good! highly suggest doing that! \n\ntldr: good sushi spot, but a bit pricy.", 
            "wandered in here without a plan for a first time meet up.\n\nthough my eyes were not necessarily on the food, i noted a few things, sitting at a table vs. sitting at the sushi bar: the emphasis was on the fusion foods (sushi menu was backpage) and the drink menu was bigger than the food menu. i agree with bunny g. that no one bothered to explain anything about the menus.\n\nordered their house ice tea which is a mint tea arnold palmer, served with lemon & lime wedges.  very tasty & refreshing since i don't think i've ever had an arnie with mint tea.\n\nthe edamame was standard fare, served cool with crushed rock salt sprinkled on top.  i ordered 2 rolls, <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark> (6 pcs), and a <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> (8 pcs).  the <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark> was exactly that, no fuss, frills, standouts.  the <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark>, i think was just a tuna roll served with a squirt of sriracha.  good thing i wasn't there for the food!\n\nthe decor & service were exceptional and it looked like there was a special/private dining area in the back.  interesting decor that isn't particular of any single culture, or at least any that i know of.  there were these wooden chairs that looked to be carved out of giant coconuts but could really only seat an ommpa loompa.  another strange touch, that doesn't quite work to me: the food menus were not on the small side, but the cover was like leather, as in, not self supporting.  the only way to read the menu, that didn't feel awkward, was to lay it on the table.  for some reason, i didn't want a leather menu touching my little appetizer plate.  it seems unsanitary.\n\nbecause the prices were so high, i rate the food a 2-2.5 stars, but the decor & service a solid 4 stars.  so, 3.33 stars, it is!",

            "since this was downstairs in our hotel, the palazzo, and it was happy hour, we decided to stop by. it's only in the bar area though so we had to wait a little bit for a seat or open area at the bar. special fancy drinks for $6 and then also an assortment of appetizers for also $6 each. each portion is tiny so  getting food for multiple people so it can add up. we tried the yellowtail (2 pieces in an order), <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> roll, <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark> roll, <mark>Salt and Pepper Squid</mark>, and the enzo roll (i think that's what it called). the yellowtail was fresh and had a <mark>Uni</mark> sauce (lemongrass) that it came with. the first two rolls and the squid were ok. and the enzo roll was my favorite. it had salmon and these crispy bits in it and was rolled in like a white rice paper instead of seaweed. for drinks we all tried the fresca, which had muddled strawberries and a bunch of alcohols. i found it light, sweet and refreshing. all and all, a good place for a little something something before dinner. hh is definitely not enough for a full on meal and it's a little pricey but i guess better than a regular meal here.", 
            "love sushi. love pan-asian so i had high expectations. absolutely amazing <mark>Tuna Tataki</mark> recommended by bartender.  see my pic. i would return here just to eat it again!salmon sashimi was fresh but nothing memorable. even at the bar the service was awful, quite prompt probably due to being there 3 pm but they got orders wrong on both sides of me, and not terribly attentive. yes they're expensive but no more so than any similar quality restaurant. if you want good, cheap authentic asian food you need to go off-strip to where the locals live.", 
            "my favorite destination on my annual trip to las vegas. mari, the bartender, is awesome. so friendly and ready to suggest great stuff. i have fairly standard stuff -- <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark>, spicy salmon  gyoza. always tasty. nice selection of sake. i like to sit at the bar. a great \"comfort food\" place, if you love sushi. yum!", 
            "the food was very impressive.  the experience was what ruined the entire evening.  the noise level was quite loud, but nothing that i haven't experienced before.  we made a reservation and were really looking forward to some great sushi.  we ordered edamame to start with, the <mark>Samba Sushi</mark> chef's selection and a dragon roll.  the waitress recommended we get more, even though we had already run through the menu with her and settled on what we would be ordering.  the edamame arrived, and seriously 30 seconds later all the sushi made its way to the table.  we maybe spent 30 total minutes at the restaurant.  it was a overall a really unfor<mark>Tuna</mark> experience, and had it not been for the food, it would have been truly awful.", 
            "open late! the sushi here was awesome! the service was ok... i wanted to give this place a 5 star but the waitress insisted on letting us know about the drama in the restaurant repeatedly. we had a <mark>Soft Shell Crab Roll</mark> that was to die for.. fresh crab in the roll along with a <mark>Alaskan King Crab</mark> claw with the fresh claw meat still in it. we ordered a roll that was to have no rice and as a substitute for the seaweed they use cucumber that is sliced thin to wrap around the sashimi inside. unfor<mark>Tuna</mark> after waiting for about 20 min for this roll the waitress came to tell us they made a mistake in the back and no longer have the cucumber. in order to make up for it they gave us a roll they made in error on the house. all in all i would come back, but might avoid the waitress as i feel she aired to much of the internal problems to us.", 
            "food is good. prices are not.\n\n- <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>: $29 miso glazed and pretty freakin delicious. cooked perfectly also. but the portion was probably 3 maybe 4 bites at most.\n\n- handrolls: we had salmon skin, salmon and avocado, <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark>, and yellowtail. the ingredients were fresh, but the rolls were very small and about ~$8-$10/each.\n\n- various rolls: we tried the yamato ($19 for 3 pieces). there wasn't even enough for me to get a chance to try it since there were only 3 pieces lol, but my friends said it was probably the best roll there. pure decadence being topped with <mark>Foie Gras</mark>, caviar, and gold flakes. we also tried a few other rolls for which i can't remember the names (sorry!) but they had <mark>Seared W<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> Beef</mark> and another had <mark>Half Maine Lobster</mark>. both were interesting, but i wasn't blown away.\n\n- nigiri: fresh but again, extremely pricey! $5-$10 a piece! yup, not an order of 2 pieces...that price is per piece! o_o\n\n- sides: we ordered the corn and plantains at $7 each. the corn was delicious but a very small portion in a cup. same thing with plantains. grilled deliciously but only a few slices for a whopping $7.\n\nif you haven't gotten the undertone of my review yet, it's that this place is expensive! lol we each paid roughly $50/person and no one left feeling full. it wouldn't have been so bad had the service been better though. we were missing a few things at the table and had to ask several times for it (place setting, water, and soy sauce dishes).", 
            "my boyfriend took me and another couple here for this past valentines day. \n\nit was super empty at 8:30 pm on valentines night which i thought was really weird. \n\ni'll start off by saying service was impeccable. even the manager came over to check on us and wish us a happy valentines day and even chatted it up with us for a little while. he even brought some kind of champagne with strawberries for us at the end of our dinner. i believe his name was jeremy so if i'm correct....then thanks jeremy you definitely made our experience a good one. kudos to philip our waiter as well. he dealt with our drunk asses throughout the entire dinner and provided amazing service at the same time. \n\nwe ordered an order of the <mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> to try. yeh we ended up ordering another 4 orders right away. i think that might give you a good idea of just how amazing this dish is. i can guarantee you won't be disappointed with it. then we got the churrasco with like 3 or 4 different meats that came with 3 different sauces. if you've got money to spend then i definitely suggest getting this dish. the <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> hand roll with spicy mayo on top was also amazing. hands down the best <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> hand roll i've ever had. \n\nthe two downsides to this place and the reason i took off one star is because of how pricy this place is for the amount of food they give you and the fact that their bathroom had absolutely no lights. i literally couldn't see where i was or what i was doing the entire time i was in the stall. \n\noverall if i have a lot or extra cash to spend then i will most definitely be back for the great service and especially another helping of the <mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> and <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> hand roll.", 
            "fantastic food and great service. had reservations on a sunday night and all the staff members was very attentive to our table. every dish we had was mouth watering. the <mark>Tuna Tataki</mark> was so delicious. the <mark>Sao Paulo</mark> roll is unlike any sushi i've tried - the blend of flavors and texture is so tasty. even the drinks we had were very good. i'm looking forward to going back next time i'm in town.", 
            "not impressed!  went here for happy hour and it was empty (usually a bad sign)!  our waitress/bartender was snooty and not very helpful.  i hate that because for us part of the experience of sitting at the bar is chatting with the bartender, but unfor<mark>Tuna</mark> that didn't happen here.  the happy hour appetizers were tiny and we calculated that each small bite we took cost about $3 which is probably normal for vegas, but we had found other wonderful happy hours that were a much better deal and a lot more fun.  i really wanted to like this place because the menu looked interesting and it had great reviews, but will not be returning.", 
            "my girlfriend and i stayed at the venetian and came here after watching cirque du soliel: zarkana at aria on 05-11-14. i found this restaurant on yelp before we came. i absolutely love sushi and she hates it. we both love texas de brazil so i figured a good compromise would be a churrascaria crossed with a sushi bar so we picked sushi samba. i always like to find the most expensive roll at sushi bars and try it so i picked the s\\u00c3o paulo for $24. it had <mark>Scallop</mark>, masago, red onion, tuna, salmon, shrimp, yellowtail, avocado, truffle, hacho miso soy, chive oil inside. to be honest the red onion over powered the flavor of every other ingredient and kind of ruined it for me. this is coming from someone that loves onions too. if i come back i'll probably ask them to cut that out when i order. i also ordered a generic <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> roll. for our two sharable sides we ordered <mark>Purple Potato Mash</mark> and <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark>. the two sides were the best thing at this restaurant. the <mark>Purple Potato Mash</mark> had a rich buttery taste and creamy texture that melted in my mouth. the <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark> had a perfect amount of sweetness and the texture was lightly firm just the way i like. the real downside of the meal though is that my girlfriend decided to order the <mark>Berkshire Pork Belly</mark> rather than the <mark>Lamb Chop</mark> she was thinking about. i asked if she was sure she wanted that and she said yes. i neglected to mention to her that <mark>Berkshire Pork Belly</mark> is literally a seared section of fat. she was not pleased, but didn't want to order anything else when her food arrived. my girlfriend was actually quite content with the <mark>Purple Potato Mash</mark> and <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark>. overall the experience was pretty good except for the group of 3 drunk russian speaking call girls (assuming) seated next to us that were intent on yelling over the music the entire time they were there instead of leaning in to hear one another. but, hey if you aren't hearing a drunk person screaming in another language next to you at most of the places you're at then you aren't experiencing vegas the right way. ha!", 
            "i am so glad we had the chance to dine at sushisamba our last night in vegas! our waiter michael was fantastic and made the entire experience that much more memorable. we literally loved everything we ordered. be sure to make a reservation because it gets very busy, and if you're celebrating anything let the hostess know. we were celebrating our wedding anniversary and they gave us a free small dessert.\n\nsmall plates:\n<mark>Seared W<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> Beef</mark> goyza - do not miss this! it was incredible - every table around us had also ordered it and we were in unanimous agreement.\n\nyellowtail crispy taquitos - light & delicious with an asian dressing on the greens.\n\nrobata:\nribeye - it's described as spicy but it's not, just has subtle spic flavoring and was very tender.\n\n<mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> - phenomenal. there's a reason it's the most popular thing on the menu. melts in your mouth with an amazing miso glaze.\n\nsamba rolls:\n<mark>Neo Tokyo</mark>: similar to a <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> roll flavor but with tuna both inside and on top of the roll. fresh and great flavor.\n\ndessert: \nfried doughnuts with cream dipping sauce - oh my goodness, sooo good. not a light dessert (fried dough) but ah-ma-zing.\n\nsince we were celebrating our wedding anniversary, they gave us a free small dessert of green tea ice cream pops dipped in chocolate with pop candy crust, which was cool and refreshing.\n\nwe will definitely be back on our next trip!", 
            "you can't go wrong with their appetizer and small dishes here. we particularly like <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark> (crispy outside and extra soft inside!!), <mark>Tuna Tataki</mark>, <mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark>!\n\nwe ordered the popular miso <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> large plate, but we think it was ok not that special. \n\nwe really don't like japanese w<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> tobanyaki 2oz because they use coconut cream which makes everything way too creamy and heavy. i don't think coconut flavor go well with the meat too. \n\nhowever, their dessert is awesome! we love their peruvian chocolate cherry custard!! don't let the name fools you. it may sounds like nothing special but they have a special way to make it special. they somehow use chocolate crumble to mix with chocolate pudding and vanilla ice cream and cherry sauce is perfect combination!!!! would come back here again for the dessert itself.", 
            "i'm giving 5 stars because the sushi was fantastic, and the dishes were creative and inspired. love the brazilian fusion. tried two kinds of sashimi ceviche, both delicious. <mark>Scallop</mark> were amazing. had some salmon and yellowtail sashimi that was fresh and perfect. and, a special take on a <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> roll that was unbelievable. the service was fine. not thrilling, but perfectly serviceable.", 
            "this is a review of their happy hour (4-7pm and 11pm until close).\n\nthe skinny: spent $50+ on sub par peruvian influenced japanese food (2.5), service: was slow when we wanted to leave (3) value: seeing as there was only 1 dish out of 8 that we would get again, we won't likely be back (3).\n\nwe were excited to see that they had a happy hour menu while meandering through the venetian properties. we thought great! if the food is good during happy hour, we'll come back another time and try their other regularly priced dishes. \n\nso we ordered 8 out of 10 ($6)items on their happy hour menu. of the 8, we'd probably get only 1 item again. the rest was pretty mediocre considering how much they charge for each dish and the level of cuisine.\n\nwe should have known. i mean when the first dish - yellowtail tiradito - came out, i knew it wasn't going to be good. the thinly sliced 2 pieces of yellowtail were drowning in a pepper sauce. i really couldn't taste the flavor of the fish at all. definitely not well balanced. \n\n<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> (3 pieces) with kabocha puree was okay. although the beef had a wonderful smokiness to it, the gyoza were disappointingly undersalted even after dunking in a good amount of soy sauce. the kabocha squash was relatively flavorless which surprised me after reading reviews about this dish.\n\nchicken anticuchos (2 skewers)were not bad although they weren't particularly memorable either. the meat, slightly grilled/charred, was not crispy enough texturally although it was adequately seasoned.\n\neggplant anticuchos with a side of <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark> was okay. i dug the slightly herbaceous kick of the chiffonated mint or basil, cutting the sweetness of the soy based sauce. however the eggplant was a tinge on the tougher side and needed to be roasted with more oil to give it a better texture.  the <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark> is definitely not one of my favorite foods. potato-like in taste and texture, the chef was able to infuse some acidity to make it more flavorful. it was more palatable with the hit of citrus but still, nothing i needed to try again.\n\nthe sushi (veggie kun - kind of like futomaki, ezo roll - meager amounts of salmon/asparagus with a ton of panko breadcrumbs mixed in = bad mouth feel, and <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> - acceptable but nothing exciting) was the most lackluster portion of our meal. considering rice composes about 50% of sushi, it was highly disappointing to find it overly mushy and over seasoned. it kind of ruined it for me. factor in the high rice to filling ratio, i cannot recommend any sushi dish made here. this is rather unfor<mark>Tuna</mark> because sushi comprises at least a significant portion of the menu.\n\nthe only highlight of the meal was the <mark>Salt and Pepper Squid</mark>. melt-in-your-mouth tender pieces of squid with a delicate batter, this was the one dish that the hubs and i truly enjoyed.\n\nfood service was surprisingly and perhaps questionably prompt. there was a small gap in service with our last dish but it wasn't too bad. it was unfor<mark>Tuna</mark> that the bar service was slower than expected and easily overwhelmed. after our meal, we just wanted to get the check processed and go. however, a loud obnoxious group of women (aka the skanky looking anti-milfs who obviously collected club wristbands) completely commandeered her attention with to go orders. the two other bartenders were milling around but did not help her. so the hubs had to endure some random, potentially contagious woman's behind rubbing against his left leg while she took orders from other groups of people. he was highly grumpy after being mauled and ignored.\n\nin reality, this joint rates about a 2.5 however i rounded up to a three based on the fact that there was 1 dish which was truly outstanding. however, given our experience, we are not likely to return. 3 starred review.", 
            "my dining experience fell short of my expectations considering what we ate (or shall i say what we didn't eat) compared to what we paid. there were 21 of us for dinner and we had the chef's selection, also known as omakase. typically, you would get the most innovative dishes ordering this style.  however, we were served typical menu items.  i think it was just a strategic way for them to serve a larger group without having to cater to individual orders. \n\nthe good was that most of the items we tasted were pretty good. the bad was that we weren't given enough food to taste everything, even though we were all charged the same price.  \n\ninstead, we shared each plate of food between 5-7 people, which included the following: \n(1) <mark>Tuna Tataki</mark>: only got to try it because someone didn't eat raw fish. \n(2) <mark>Seared W<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> Beef</mark> dumplings: not enough brought out so i never got to try it. \n(3) mini yellow tail tacos:  i liked the spicy foam which added a nice kick to the citrus-ey flavors of the dish. \n(4) crab tempura: how ridiculous is it that there were only several pieces to each order so the hubs and i had to share one bite of one piece? this wouldn't even qualify as an amuse-bouche. \n(5) <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> and shrimp skewers: again, not enough so most of us shared skewers. \n(6) steak and mushroom stew: everyone got 1-2 thin slices of beef, which was tender and flavorful. \n(7) sushi rolls/sashimi: the sushi rolls were the most generous items served (about 5 cut rolls) but imo were rather underwhelming. the sashimi, on the other hand, was delicious and fresh. we were given about 3 slices each of yellowtail, tuna, and salmon which i easily could have eaten by myself.\n\ni felt bad for the hubs because he was still hungry and asked what was being served next, only to be told that it was just dessert followed by a $2500 bill ($240 per couple). \n\nyes, our server was pleasant and friendly. yes, the food was quite tasty.  and, yes, they need to recalculate the amount of food for groups ordering from the chef's selection. sure, i expected to pay a lot for this kind of meal, but what i didn't expect was to leave unsatisfied and wanting for more.", 
            "yum!! i always leave ss looking forward to my next visit. the table always enjoys a wide variety of dishes, my fav being the yellow tail with jalape\\u00f1os and lemongrass, lobster tacos, miso <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> and this last visit we tried the <mark>12 Oz Ribeye Tobanyaki</mark> and it was out if this world. even though stuffed one of my friends threatened to order another bowl of the awesome <mark>Coconut Rice</mark> just to not leave an life of the sauce the meat was made in because it had to be eaten.\n\nwe had an extraordinary server that evening but i unfor<mark>Tuna</mark> i can't remember his name!! he reminded us of marky mark in a way.",

            "don't order takeout. \n\ni usually love sushisamba and make a point to eat there every time i go to vegas. this time, i was extremely disappointed.\n\ni ordered 2 <mark>Rio Grande</mark> to go since i had to catch a flight and the folks back home love the <mark>Rio Grande</mark>. unfor<mark>Tuna</mark>, part of my order was missing, even after i questioned it.\n\non the bill, the <mark>Rio Grande</mark> was listed as gaucho, so i asked about this and they assured me that it was the same. since i usually have a great meal and the service is usually good, i didn't question it. the <mark>Rio Grande</mark> is 45 dollars on the menu, so i expected to be charged 90 for both. however, for those two items, it was listed as $114. i also ordered 2 sides. \n\ni didn't bring it up because i usually love sushisamba and wouldn't mind paying more to support the restaurant. i also ordered a cocktail and the w<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> appetizer while waiting, so my bill was a bit hefty. on top of this, i included roughly a 20 percent so my total bill was about 190 - after i was reassured that my order was correct. i didn't have time to look through the bag because i needed to catch a flight, but once i got to the airport, i found out that the chorizo and the ribeye steak was not included (usually the <mark>Rio Grande</mark> comes with those two proteins and the picanha, but my order only had the picanha, the two sides i ordered.\n\nyou can imagine my frustration. when i takeout from a restaurant, especially one that i frequent, i expect my order to be correct. i honestly regret tipping so much and even ordering takeout from there today.\n\ni would give 1 star for this experience. the extra star is because i usually do have a positive experience (with philip, who is the best server in the world and has great service).\n\ni don't think i will come back here ever again. something amazing would have to happen for me to give this place a second chance.",

            "i ate here last week. i initially enjoyed the ambiance, the nice wait staff, and the wide selection of sushi, robata, and cocktails. however, our food and drinks were littered with inedible garnishes. one of our drinks contained inedible wood sticks and leaves, while the plate came with a side of hollowed out crustacean appendages.\n\nwhile i understand that the harvested tree parts add to the flavor of the drink, the crustacean carcases added nothing to the plate other than to disgust their customers. it was sickening. i almost sent the food back, but i decided to give it a try.\n\nfor<mark>Tuna</mark> the food and drinks were decent. they weren't memorable in the sense that i will tell my friends and family about it, but the food and drinks were a good attempt at sushi, robata, and cocktails. i would give the quality of the food 3 stars.\n\nhowever, when i spoke with the manager about the disproportionate amount of inedible food on the plate, he was extremely rude to me. instead of explaining why the presentation was the way it was, he simply said \"this is the way we make it,\" and he walked away. anyone in a customer service centric job can tell you this is the wrong way to respond to a custom complaint.\n\nat the end of the evening my wife and i were left feeling that we were overcharged, under-served, and disrespected by the management. i could forgive the obvious technical errors with the food if the staff was more comm<mark>Uni</mark>, but the interaction i had with the evening under-experienced manager only added insult to injury, which is why i give this restaurant 1 star.",

            "this is my favorite restaurant in vegas! the space itself is dark / trendy and has crazy beams and accents running across the ceilings and walls. we started off with the yellowtail taquitos. they were absolutely delicious! i still dream of how fresh the fish was and how it was so well balanced by the crispiness of the taco. unfor<mark>Tuna</mark>, the portions were so small! at $6 per taquito, i was expecting something more filling. \n\ni had the <mark>Sao Paulo</mark> roll as my entree. this is basically a rainbow roll that you'd get at any other sushi restaurant. i was impressed by the quality of the fish and the sauces on the side. at $24, however, the price seemed a bit steep for a standard roll. \n\nif you're looking for quality japanese fusion food here, don't hesitate to stop by sushisamba! you won't be disappointed, but you may have to shell out a bit more cash than expected. would love to do the custom tasting menu, but maybe another time.", 
            "such a disappointing dinner! no one wants to walk away from their nice vegas dinner feeling disappointed- that's what the blackjack tables are for!\n\nhere's what we didn't like:\nthe service: our waiter would walk away mid sentence to attend to another table. um hello? finish your sentence! \n\nthe food and drinks: we unfor<mark>Tuna</mark> didn't like anything we tried and we tried many of the sushi and sashimi options on the menu. for a place that has sushi in its name, the sushi was a huge letdown.\n\nthe bathrooms: weird creepy stalls with sliding doors that reminded me of an airplane toilet and not very clean! \n\nwhy 2 stars instead of one?\n-our water was refilled constantly! (that's big in my book!)\n-possibly the happy hour menu is better? or the meat instead of sushi? trying to give them the benefit of the doubt.\n-they are open late!\n\nwith so many better places to eat on the strip, i'd suggest skipping sushisamba.", 
            "hands down the best sushi experience ever! i took my boyfriend and i out here because lord knows we needed a break from work! our reservation was for 11:30pm and due to us trying to find their location, we unfor<mark>Tuna</mark> was late. we arrived at about 11:52pm and went straight to the hostess, where she was very nice and stylish if i might add. she relayed to us that it was ok that we were late because they're open till 1am anyway. her reassurance helped us to calm down, because we both like to be punctual. for that, i am grateful!\n\nour experience on the dining side of it all was beyond words exceptional. our server was tee, she definitely was enthusiastic about being our server. others came to drop our plates off but she mainly catered to us from beginning to end. she started us off with drinks and we never once had to ask for a refill she always was alert. we didn't know what to get so she offered her favorites and personal suggestions. we indulged in <mark>Crispy Hokkaido Scallop</mark> and <mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark> which is tempura style tofu. being from hawai'i, we both love rice! so this fit us perfectly! we had a roll each of <mark>Rainbow Dragon</mark> and a lima roll! simple yet tasty, perfect for any occasion. we had dessert and we had a samba split which was amazingggg!!! i had on the side some mochi ice cream and i couldn't stop eating on both dishes! my boyfriend definitely loved the samba split because of the caramelized banana's and the doce de leite ice cream together and caramel popcorn; my favorite part of it was the coconut flan and the japanese whisky whipped cream together and altogether was phenomenal experience.\n\nambiance was very quaint but vivid; artistry was displayed very nicely. lights were dimmed so it made the experience very more intimate which i enjoyed. i would recommend everyone to go here for any reason very good prices for good portions!", 
            "i love sushisamba! i was very familiar with the london location and this was actually my 2nd visit to the vegas location. the food never disappoints at either venue and if you are new to the brand i would recommend having the server either order for you or working closely with them to craft your own \"tasting menu\".  the concept of japanese, peruvian and brazilian can be intimidating and unfamiliar to most but you have to just go with it! \n\nwe let the manager, jason p, order for us and we couldn't have been happier! he was super friendly and asked about any allergies and dietary restrictions and got everything on point. we had an assortment of small plates: <mark>Green Bean Tempura</mark>, edamame, pardon peppers, a <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> roll, some <mark>Crispy Hokkaido Scallop</mark> lettuce wrap, assorted taquitos of yellow tail / lobster / crab and <mark>Mushroom Tobanyaki</mark> with <mark>Duck Breast</mark>. everything was cooked and seasoned perfectly and the staff even made a point to let us know which items to eat first to enjoy at the best possible temperature. everyone we encountered was friendly, engaging, knowledgeable on the menus and so hospitable! \n\nto sum it up, jason p and the whole ss team know what they're freaking doing and i can't wait to go back!", 
            "we checked out this place over the weekend for a girlfriend's bachelorette celebration, and had a fantastic time.\n\ni don't remember our server's name, but he was very attentive, patient and focused on providing the best possible experience. we had a vegetarian in our group, and he was kind enough to tell us about the vegetarian options and even provide a vegan menu for us to explore. my only quip would be the restaurant's \"set your own price & we'll customize the menu \" option - when we heard about it, we were immediately enthusiastic and decided to set a $25 per head price. unfor<mark>Tuna</mark> the server told us that the restaurant wanted a $50 per head minimum for that option... seems a little strange to me. \n\nwe ended up ordering off the a la carte menu, which was fantastic. we opted for:\n\nseared ahi <mark>Tuna Tataki</mark>: yum! each slice of seared ahi tuna was served atop a spinach leave and with a delightful sauce. absolutely delicious. i could have made a meal out of this dish alone (if i didn't have to share...hehe).\n\notsumami - blistered shishito peppers, edamame and <mark>Green Bean Tempura</mark>: we originally planned to order a standard edamame bowl, but we followed our server's recommendation to order this instead. so glad we did! the dish was a perfect portion for 5 hungry people. a few in our group hadn't tried shishito peppers before, so they were absolutely wowed. the tempura was decent - not mindblowing by any standards, but definitely not oily or soggy like some other tempura variations.\n\nlima roll: this roll was fantastic. i like tempura shrimp when it's not in sushi, and this roll definitely changed my mind on that - it was absolutely delicious.\n\namazonia roll: our vegetarian friend loved this roll. it's wonderful that sushisamba has this option, since the <mark><mark>Osetra Caviar Imperial 20g</mark> 20g</mark>, sweet potato and cucumber rolls can get a little boring for our herbivore friends.\n\nsao paolo roll: my personal favorite! extremely delicious. such an amazing combination of flavors and textures. \n\nsomehow, we all had room for dessert and opted for the mango tres leites cake. it was served with a dollop of mango ice cream and a matcha green tea dipping sauce. overall, a truly delicious end to a fantastic meal. i can't wait to visit the sushisamba in new york!", 
            "close to perfect as a sushi restaurant can be here at the palazzo. a tad high priced but it's las vegas. even the basic <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> roll is outstanding! the yellowtail tacos are delicious and the cocktails are fresh. two thumbs up!", 
            "absolutely delicious! we went with a large group and they offer tasting menus - which would have been a good idea but we had a lot of different sushi favorites so we all ordered separately. \n\ni started with a <mark>Tuna Tataki</mark> appetizer that may have been the best i've ever had. the tuna was perfectly seasoned and seared. my mouth started drooling thinking about it. i wanted 10 more pieces. \n\ni then had a roll but i cannot for the life of me remember the name. it was slightly tempura but delicious. great size as well. \n\ni went for a bachelorette weekend and they gave us two free cocktail towers which was extremely nice. \n\noverall very great experience here. we stayed at the venetian so the location also helped!", 
            "in early may i was in las vegas on business and wanted to entertain some colleagues for dinner. we were a party of eleven and with that many pallets to please, we needed something different, we needed sushisamba. \n\na couple people in the group had been here before and spoke highly of the fusion restaurant, but for many of us this would be our first time so we made a reservation for 7pm. typically when we travel for business there is always one or two people who join your group at the last minute, so we held a table for thirteen just in case. \n\nmost of us arrived to the restaurant on time however two people were running a few minutes late but on their way. unfor<mark>Tuna</mark> because we were not a party of ten, the server refused to seat us, even though it would only be a few minutes for them to arrive. she also said they could only hold our reservation for 10 minutes.  needless to say, they arrived in time, but i thought that it was not only a poor business decision to seat us early (most people will enjoy a cocktail or two while waiting) but just rude. \n\nwe were seated in the far back of the restaurant and the servers were very attentive. they quickly explained the brazilian-peruvian-japanese fusion concept of the restaurant and then without missing a beat he began to pitch us on the \"chef's choice\" option to the menu. i will admit, it was a good pitch, but obviously too good to be true. with this option the chef would listen to our likes and dislikes and create dishes that appeal to our tastes based on our budget, much like when dining at a chef's table.  the catch to this.... the restaurant was packed, there is no way the kitchen is creating anything special for us.... they're just serving menu items that will maximize your budget and increase your check. \n\nsadly five of us fell for it and ordered the \"chef's choice\" menu, the rest of us ordered ala carte and decided we would share plates amongst each other and asked for separate checks.  funny enough most of the plates that were being served off the \"chef's choice\" menu were the same plates we ordered, but with a few exceptions.  the food was good.  it by no means blew me away, but nothing i ate was bad and i really cant find anything negative to say about it. we had a number of small dishes that included edamame, <mark>Seaweed Salad</mark>, rock shrimp and <mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark>, plus an assortment of sushi rolls. \n\nthe checks came and as expected the \"chef's choice\" total was nearly $100 more than the ala carte (and we had an extra person).  i signed the bill, put the receipt in my wallet and didn't look at it again until i got back to the office and had to submit my expenses. \n\nas i reviewed the bill i took notice to the quantities of the plates ordered. we specifically ordered different items knowing that we were sharing, so i was surprised to see that i had duplicates on five items. i know we all liked the rock shrimp and ordered another plate, so that wasn't a concern. however there was only one other questionable roll that no one recalls ordering and the other three were definitely not ordered, delivered or consumed.... but we paid for it. \n\nwe aren't talking about a lot of money here - $36 - $55, but it's the fact we were obviously taken advantage of.  maybe the waiter wanted a bigger tip, perhaps the restaurant wanted to recoup some funds because we didn't take the \"chef's choice\"? either way i wrote the management group letting them know of my disappointment.  in the end i got an email from the general manager offering to return my $36 with an apology. \n\n\nas a chef, when i am dining out i expect my experience to meet an acceptable level of expectations that may differ from others, however lets face it, with so many choices available these days a restaurant has to be spot on to keep you coming back.  apparently in this case sushisamba needs the money more than i do as i will not be going back.", 
            "i love sushisamba. i always come when in vegas. i was there on a sunday for lunch . we started with the anticuchos with <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark>... these were amazing!  the corn was much bigger than american corn and garnished with some sweet sauce. their sushi is always delicious and fresh i love their salmon roll  and <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> were my favorite .the staff was super friendly and the food came out super fast. always happy to come here.", 
            "so we just finished a late night meal here. i consider me and my fianc\\u00e9 to be sushi connoisseurs. we found it to be just 'meh. but than again, we have been blown away at other restaurants and after all this is a chain....\n\nanyway, we got here after 11pm and were seated. we specifically came here for the happy hour but were told after being seated, happy hour menu is at the bar only. you mean the 15 seat bar? we don't drink so i declined. not to forget, it's no where stated on the menu... our mediocre late night snack came to $70....\n\nshould stuck to my rule of only dining where the locals go. \n\n<mark>Salt and Pepper Squid</mark>- good. not overly fried. lime was nice touch.\n\n<mark>Samba Strip</mark>, <mark>Salmon Avocado</mark> and <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark>... nothing fancy and have had way better.", 
            "food was ok,  a little over priced (3 pieces of yellowtail sashimi, one <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> roll and a beer - $45 before tip).\ni don't recommend sitting at the \"sushi bar\" . the guys are not sushi chefs, just bored guys waiting for an order to fill. . there is no interaction (you have to wait for the server to come around to order your sushi, then wait for them to deliver it), so you spend your meal time with bored guys in front of your and your back to the restaurant. ... oh. .and fricken flies! ! i spent the mealtime swatting away flies. .not exactly what one wants to see when dealing with raw fish :-/\n\nacoustics are horrible,  everyone is yelling trying to be heard. .\n\ni probably won't eat here again.. i prefer a more. .. <mark><mark>Osetra Caviar Imperial 20g</mark> 20g</mark> bar. ..", 
            "had lunch here for the first time.  nothing that blew me out of the water but very interesting flavors.  yellowtail tacos were well done with the spicy foam sauce. yellowtail ceviche and salmon ceviche- maybe i was expecting fresh surprise like nobu's flavored sashimi but it fell quite a bit short. their <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> was okay but not great. <mark><mark>Osetra Caviar Imperial 20g</mark> 20g</mark> was excellent where you can taste the freshness.  my favorite was the tempura green beans.  it was fun trying all these new flavors.  i would recommend for as an adventure.", 
            "i've stayed at the venetian/palazzo a dozen times and had never eaten at sushi samba. what a terrible mistake i've made all these years. looking for a restaurant in the hotel for our bachelor party, we decided upon sushisamba due to the variety of dishes, the vibrant atmosphere, and positive word of mouth reviews. we made a reservation through opentable, and were promptly seated upon arrival.\n\nsamba proclaims to have the most extensive sake selection in vegas, and we let our server choose a cheaper bottle for us and it was delicious. \n\n1) japanese a5 <mark>Seared W<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> Beef</mark> gyoza (4.5/5) - you get 5 delicious pot stickers with quality beef that just melts in your mouth\n\n2) yellowtail taquito (5/5) - there are two mandatory dishes to get and this is one of them. essentially a mini taco with yellowtail, roasted corn miso, and avocado. the explosion of flavor was mind-numbingly good and even friends who don't enjoy seafood loved this\n\n3) yellowtail sashimi (4.5/5) - 4 slices of high quality yellowtail, the sauce is delicate and sour\n\n4)  <mark>Berkshire Pork Belly</mark> (3.75/5) - i am admittedly biased towards <mark>Berkshire Pork Belly</mark> so i loved the dish. the butterscotch miso on top was a little overwhelming but the <mark>Berkshire Pork Belly</mark> itself was cooked to perfection\n\n5) <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> anticucho (5/5) - this is the other mandatory dish. we were very for<mark>Tuna</mark> because the table next to us came 15 minutes after and they ran out of this dish! the <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> skewer is  their signature dish and deservedly so. two skewers of <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> cooked so perfectly (soft on inside, slightly crispy exterior), there aren't enough superlatives to describe how delicious it is. \n\n6) <mark>Rio Grande</mark> (4/5) - from their churrasco menu, includes three types of meat: ribeye, chorizo, and w<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> picanha. i would not suggest this if you are eating by yourself or with another because it is just so much meat. in a larger group setting, i think this dish is perfect to share. the w<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> picanha is my favorite because the meat was so soft and tender.\n\nquite simply, i loved my experience at sushisamba. the service was fantastic. the food was <mark>Uni</mark> and delicious at the same time. the atmosphere embodies that of vegas- vibrant and exciting. the price of the dinner was what i'd expect from a \"strip\" restaurant, so be prepared to spend at least $50. \n\ni can't wait to go back to sushisamba for some yellowtail tacos and <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>.", 
            "this a great place with fantastic food. we kept on ordering and ended up with a bill of over $100 but every penny was worth it. we started by ordering some fresh juice <mark>Salt and Pepper Squid</mark>. portion was small but magical. then we had <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> roll and tirad salmon and again they were amazing. then we ordered sao paolo: something of heaven. needs to be tried for sure the dessert was peanut choco which made us speechless as it was fantastic. highly recommended and good value for money.", 
            "we started our happy hour with several nina frescas and classic mojitos.  fresh strawberry pur\\u00e9e, vodka, orange liquor, and guava.  spectacular and they were only $6 each. next we sampled <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> roll, <mark>Salt and Pepper Squid</mark>, w<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> goya, <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark> roll, chicken anticuchos, and yellow tiradito sashimi. everything was amazingly prepared and all of our choices were perfectly flavored. we sat at the bar and brian explained the menu in detail, recommended drinks, and made sure our service was on point.  everyone at the restaurant was friendly and focused on customer service.  the music and atmosphere was hip and entertaining.  we will be back on our next vegas trip. you can also ask for jason; he will make sure that all of your detailed requests are handled."

            "alright, now were getting to the good stuff. \n\nand by \"good\" i mean un-fucking-believable. yea, i said it. unreal. never have i wanted to pick up and move to vegas so much in all of my life, but i'm thinking about it after the dinner i had at sushisamba's new ultra lounge, sugarcane. this is an incredible statement for me because for one, i can only take vegas in small doses, and two, i despise the heat. so having said that you can believe me when i say that i love absolutely everything about sushisamba, the brazilian/peruvian/japanese fusion restaurant at the palazzo. \n\nwhere do i begin?\n\noh yes, holy mary mother of god, i've died and gone to heaven...\n\na friend of mine is the publicist for this new restaurant, as well as the brand spanking new, sugarcane. she hooked up a dinner reservation for me and some friends so that we could celebrate my good friend's birthday in style. upon our (late) arrival we were greeted warmly by the wait staff, as they explained to us that our party would be the very first members of the public to sit down to dinner in their brand new ultra lounge. as we walked through the dimly lit hallway, past the dj booth and dance floor, and into the dining area portion of sugarcane we were immediately taken back by the overall design concept of the space. i\"m gonna do my best to do it justice but i would highly recommend a trip here to experience for yourself because it is just too complex for words...\n\nthe walls are covered with graffiti-style murals of samurais and japanese script, the dance floor has a canvas like screen that wraps around the circular pods that make up the women's bathrooms (see pics) where they project abstract imagery to coincide with the music playing. the dj that night was claudio who i wanted to put in my pocket and take home because the music was just that dope. there are multi-colored glass cylinders that hang from the ceiling and beams of light (see pics) that separate the dance floor from the dining area that change from red to orange to white that create a truly magnificent effect. \n\nthe food and service is on a level that is even harder to explain - it was incredible. our waiter anthony took such good care of us we felt as though we were old friends by the time we left. of course, we were the first to be seated and the last to leave, so i guess if you spend enough time with your waiter (four hours) you begin to feel like family. our sake sommelier was a hilariously funny girl (i forgot her name) and very helpful and knowledgeable when describing our sake selections. we ended up choosing a bottle with gold leaf cherry blossoms there were supposedly good luck if you found them floating in your drink. \n\nour table decided to order the signature sushisamba 7-course omakase ($70 per person) as our dinner selection. anthony asked us if we had any food allergies or other special requests before going back to the kitchen to get our party started. our first course was a selection of appetizers (see pics) which included the kobe beef carpaccio with <mark>Mixed <mark>Wild Mushrooms</mark></mark>, seared ahi tuna on a tiny bed of spinach, and (my favorite) tiny ceviche fish tacos with a chili foam sauce that was amazing! next up was the best snow crab i have ever tasted, <mark>Filet Mignon</mark>, duck, chilan <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> (unreal), grilled tomatoes, fish jowel (i forget what kind) and the most beautiful sashimi plate i've ever seen/tasted. just when we thought we couldn't eat any more came the sushi course. a stand out roll was the kobe beef wrapped roll with (from what i can remember) a <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark>, cucumber and avocado center. as we sat back in our booth contemplating exactly how we were planning on walking out of there, anthony presented the birthday girl with an incredible chocolate fondue plate (see pics) complete with japanese-style sesame rice krispies, japanese cake, homemade marshmallows, and a selection of fruit. there were also mini fruit tacos with both mango and banana, with a chocolate mousse and caram<mark>El Topo</mark>. \n\ndo you see what i'm talking about?????\n\nhere's the rundown....\n\nparty <mark><mark>Assortment of Four</mark></mark>:\nfirst round of cocktails (on the house)\nseveral cocktails to follow\nbottle of premium sake\n7- course omakase dinner for four ($70 each)\nafter dinner cocktails\ndivine dessert platter\n\ntotal bill: approx $600\n\nnot bad i'd say. not bad at all. \n\nall in all, i plan to go back to visit several times over. anyone who stumbles upon this place should consider themselves lucky to be in the presence of such foodie excellence. this dinner made our entire trip, and made for a very, very happy birthday girl. \n\nsushisamba: the wait staff, the owner, the managers, the dj. you rock my rock-n-roll world.", 
            "i was worried about eating at a brand new chain on the strip. i expected to overpay for the quality of food, and get a ton of attitude from the staff. i was pleasantly surprised. \n\nmy friend and i decided to go with the $80 omasake (yes they spell it funny) tasting menu. we asked what was on it, and the waiter said he'd just pick out food around our budget and requests. this seemed odd, but we went with it. we told him we eat everything and to surprise us. i'm trying to remember everything we got, but i'm sure i'm forgetting some things: \n\nedamame/tempura green beans/roasted peppers: wow, one of my fav dishes. everything was salty and delicious, and the sauce that came with it was to die for. get this for $16.. yes.. it sounds pricey, but trust me, just get it. \n\nyellowtail sashimi.. seemed to be in a red pepper preparation? fresh, delicious, and tasty\n\nyellowtail taco.. delicious, but be warned it's messy! \n\nshrimp mango ceviche.. very good, large portion. \n\nsteak and asparagus tempura.. steak was good, but not as jaw dropping as the fish honestly.\n\nsushi rolls: spider roll, <mark>Neo Tokyo</mark>, and i wish i could remember the name of the last one, but it was incredible and had crab meat. i am not a <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> girl.. usually the meat isn't fresh and the sauce is too goopy. this was the most incredible and fresh <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> i've ever had. \n\n\nthe fondue dessert was awesome! very fun and tons of different stuff to dip in. \n\noverall an awesome experience and staff was great.. fresh chopsticks/plates/soy sauce bowls after every couple courses.", 
            "i agree with the reviews below, they did a great job of explaining the menu in more detail than i could.  gave this place 4 stars for originality of food and drinks, and the atmosphere.  it was not too dark, not too bright, with artsy decor on the walls and different pictures rotating on projection screens (not pg rated, btw, i saw a breast or two flash by, though there were nice scenic pics in there too.)  they have a club/lounge in the back of the restaurant, which was recommended to us by a dior employee at caesars mall, he said it was a mix of hip hop music and some other music, he went on a saturday.  however, we weren't able to go since it's not open on sundays.\n\nme and two other girlfriends of mine went here late on a sunday nite (sat 10 pm?) and there was no wait.  not that this matters, but an added bonus was that our waiter was hot!  hehe.  anyways, the menu had a lot of things that i had never heard of before, so if you're not used to brazilian / peruvian / japanese food then the staff should be able to explain it all to you before you order.\n\nwe ordered the tuna ceviche and shrimp ceviche for appetizers (see reviews below for details of the dishes i talk about here).  both excellent, and fresh, and a decent-sized portion (about a cereal bowl full), but pricey at around $15-17 each.  we also ordered <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> rolls, which were excellent (the tuna practically melted in our mouths) as well as the bobobrazil roll, which mr. hottie waiter recommended - slices of kobe beef atop a roll with a bunch of good stuff in it that i didn't know (sorry to all you food buffs!).  i think it was a mix of onions?  both very good.\n\nas far as cocktails, i would definitely recommend the chu-cucumber cocktail.  i think that's the name of it.  again, mr. hottie waiter recommended this, which i decided to try even though it didn't sound good at first.  it was surprisingly refreshing!  it has some sort of japanese liquor in it, which supposedly had a lite vodka flavor, as well as roseflower and cucumber.  i ended up having two of these (they were in a martini glass), and the third having substituted the original liquor for gin, as a recommendation by the bartender, which had a stronger alcohol taste to it.  one of my friends tried the samba juice cocktail, which she said was good and tasted a little like sangria.\n\noverall, great atmosphere, a bit pricey, but original food that you wouldn't find at your regular sushi restaurant.  i would definitely try this place at least once on a trip to vegas!  hopefully i'll get to check out the lounge next time!", 
            "more of a 3.5...  although i love trendy, high ceiling restaurants that give you a modern feel..sushi samba's decor is a little too cluttered for me. maybe its because of the fact that its a twist between brazilian, japanese, and peruvian cuisine...where they feel like they need to include all three of the cultures art.. but whatever the case may be, theres just.. too much orange swirls, too many funky paintings, and too many weird faces on their walls. i like more of the simple trends. they play trendy music..which is a plus...but they crank it up as if you're in a club which in turn makes everyone talk louder than usual. it's almost as if you're in a convention. \n\n\nsome of the items that i've tried and have a vivid memory of:\n\n-yellowtail sashimi tiradito. tasted like...yellowtail in salsa. it was good..but it was different. i usually like my sashimis in ponzu sauce.\n\n-mushroom toban-yaki is reallllly good. it comes out in a hot sizzling clay pot with like four of five different kinds of mushrooms. \n\n-<mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> taquito\n\n-robata: \n<mark>Filet Mignon</mark>\n<mark>Lamb Chop</mark>\n<mark>Cherry Tomatoes</mark>\nshiitake mushrooms\n\noysters, uni sashimi. \n\noverall, its not too bad. i like the convenience. the two times i've been here was because i stayed at the palazzo. takes like 5 mins to get here from our room.", 
            "good sushi with a twist. they have some <mark>Uni</mark> flavors and rolls: bobo brazil, yamato (<mark>Foie Gras</mark>, caviar, toro) and a few others. <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> was pretty disappointing.\n\ncareful when ordering the kobe, it's $27 an ounce usually a 5oz minimum. my smart friend ordered 10oz's off the bat thinking it was only $27 total. i am not sure of the name, but the kobe cooked on a hot rock is delicious. worth $150 per order? just for the experience. \n\nif you could gamble $50 a hand on blackjack or pai gow, why not eat it as well?  \n\npros: <mark>Uni</mark> rolls and flavors\n\ncons: very pricey ($2 for wasabi haha), mediocre service both times i went", 
            "out of all the restaurants i've been to in vegas, i must say....sushi samba is probably the best one i've eaten at!  \n\nthough the food isn't cheap and the portions aren't big.....everything that i ordered was delicious and well worth the money.  i would recommend everything i ordered for those that are going there.  \nhere's what i ordered for 2 people:\n1) <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> and miso antichucos....the <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark> that comes with it was quite tasty\n2) <mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark>....3 fried tofu, 1 asparagus and 1 mushroom in some sort of sauce.  this was probably the most normal item that we ate on the menu....but it was still good.\n3) bobo brazil samba roll.  this was quite interesting...seared kobe beef roll.\n4)  some sort of <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> roll.  the tuna was high quality...very fresh!\n5) peruvian hot chocolate....this was damn good!  the drink was thick and very creamy.\n6) mango honey crisp taquito.  \n\nthinking of the food makes me drool wishing i could have it again.  \nthe service there was excellent!  waiters clean your table and fill your water before you even have to ask.  they were very attentive and not smothering.\n\nbe aware though...right when you sit down they ask you if you'd like some edamame.  you think this would be free....but you will later find out that you're being charged for it.  \n\nsushi samba is a definite must!", 
            "checked out sushi samba for lunch and was impressed. nice atmosphere, although they claim to play samba music and most of what i heard was definitely not samba (marvin gaye?). service was decent, although our server tended to recommend expensive dishes...don't know if those are the ones that are truly their specialties, if management tries to push those dishes, or if our server was just trying to upsell for a bigger tip. robata chicken skewer with <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark> was tasty, the tempura green beans with black truffle aioli were bomb, and the <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> rolls and pacific rolls were very good. i would have liked to see a little more prevalent south american influence, but it's still more <mark>Uni</mark> than your average trendy sushi joint and with good food at reasonable prices.",

            "apryl and i were looking for some sushi. we had made our way to the canal shoppes at the venetian and were browsing the directory for sushi places when we were approached by an employee. we told him what we were looking for and he quickly suggested <mark>Samba Sushi</mark>, adding that \"it's the best sushi on the strip!\"... \n\nafter walking nearly a mile, we found sushi samba. the decor looked interesting and it had a great vibe. \n\nwe each ordered a special roll and split another <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> roll. after waiting 20 minutes, three small, thin, very weird looking rolls arrived to our table. \n\ni will spare you the details of how apryl and i managed to get these things down, but it was not easy. hands down, the worst sushi i've ever had the trouble of putting in my mouth. the idea and creativity of the roll sounds better on the menu than it looks, and far better than it actually tastes. flavorless and lacking any kind of texture. \n\nsave yourself $50... buy a can of tuna and leave it in your hotel room for a day or two... it'll taste the same.",

            "we got there around 6:30pm just in time for happy hour and the bar was still pretty packed. we waited a couple of minutes till there were 2 seats available. we really shouldn't have bothered to wait...\nwe asked the bartender for happy hour menus and then we ordered a mojito and a caipirinha. my friend loves mojitos, i don't care for them. he said these were the worse he's ever had. the mojito was slightly better than the caipirinha, but not by much. it practically tasted the same. we also ordered the berry smash and the samba juice which actually looked and tasted quite similar except that the berry smash has no alcohol! none of these drinks were very strong, nor tasted good. for around $12-$15 a drink, it really should've be made by a professional. we went to craftsteak the night before and the drinks there were fantastic. the bartenders @ sushi samba are pretty, but they don't know how to make a decent cocktail. however, it's not all their fault since they were using mostly mixers and not premium alcohol/fresh ingredients unlike other upscale bars/restaurants. \n\nwe also had some apps with our drinks. \napps: <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> roll, yellowtail seviche and crispy yellowtail taquitos. \n\nfor a friday night, their sushi was clearly not very fresh. the <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> was okay, the spicy sauce that was placed on top instead of mixed with the tuna hid whatever flavor the tuna had. i didn't like the yellowtail seviche, but my friend thought it was okay. i thought it was too bitter from the lime. the worse thing out of this whole experience were the yellowtail taquitos. the fish tasted spoiled. my friend was sick all night. it could've been the ridiculous amount of alcohol we consumed that night since we went to dos caminos later that night, but my friend says it was definitely the yellowtail taquitos... the drinks at dos caminos are so much better than sushi samba's... the mojitos are strong and freshly made and the glasses are 2x the size :p",

            "came here on the reccomendation with chef micheal cressoti and i was impressed. it's located at the top floor of the palazzo with a hip and dark ambiance. okay people it's dark crowded and loud. do you forget where you are?!? it's las vegas people!! this is what you should expect. this is the new era where sushi is supposed to be hip. i took my girfriend and a third wheel there for a dinner and pretty much ordered the omakase. as a person who worked around in sushi restaraunts, lived in peru, and surrounded by brazileros, i still was taught i had alot more to learn about the cuisine and the complex flavors on the palate when mixed together. honestly unless you're ordering the kobe beef roll or the fuie gras sushi... skip the whole sushi list. the rolls are great but for the price, i would opt out for the kitchen orders. <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> was a little different but nothing to make you stand up and dance. the red miso <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> (i believe that was the fish) skewers are to die for. the grill is special grill where they use woodchips brought in from japan. this is the kind of special treatment the chefs use to creats such dishes, so the price is reasonable. all their fish is line caught so for the environmentally conscience, expect to pay more for sushi as opposed to other sushi restaraunts. their ceviche was very light and refreshing, so was the yellowtail sashimi and the ceviche. the kobe beef tacos. sorry kogi was okay for me. asian tacos are as good as it gets, but kobe beef tacos who can possibly resist. it was spectacular with the spicy emulsion that was served on the side. the duck confit with wil mushroom is a must order. succulent morsels of variety of mushrooms and the perfectly cooked medium rare breast of duck just melted in your mouth. the sake sommelier was very friendly and knew her alcohol, so if you are interested in ordering sake ask for the pro. from here and there, after 5 other dishes, we ended up with dessert. the chocolate cake, which they said was great, was rather just good, but the carrot cake. i hate carrot cake, but the pastry chef, she whippped up something so magical and delicious. not too sweet, not too heavy, not too bready... if you can understand what i mean, you will love this cake. in a cake, i look for the perfect balance of sweetness and richness, that will just top off your great meal. not to overwhelm your palate and your stomach but make a nice closure to the expensive meal you just enjoyed. it was the best carrot cake i've had. overall the staff was friendly and the general manager was kind enough to explain to me about the food and the kitchen, since i work in the kitchen as well. i left there extremely happy and with an impressed gf and third wheel. thank you sushi samba.",

            "sushi samba is pretty tucked away in the palazzo, the atmosphere is ok, service and bartenders were friendly and nice at the bar, and the food is pretty decent too.  it's also great that they have a happy hour menu from 4-7 sun-fri, but... my only gripe is that it's not really a happy hour menu if you discount items and then serve them 1/2 size, which is what i expect was happening since our portions were teeny tiny, the drinks were served in small glasses and then i saw the normal pint-size glasses that the same drinks were being made in to take to the tables. the mojitos were bomb though. \n\nthat said... the food was actually pretty good. we had the <mark>Salt and Pepper Squid</mark> (yummy!), <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> roll (small, and could've been spicier, but still good), chicken skewers, some others, and i also tried the japan relief roll (all the money goes to japan relief ppl, order it!) which was also really tasty - combo of <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark>, eel, wrapped in a soy paper wrap. \n\nit wasn't a bad way to spend $80 (esp in vegas) but again, if you're going to advertise specials for happy hour, they should actually be specials, not just 1/2 the plate for 1/2 the price. nothing special 'bout that.",

            "maybe it's because i've enjoyed many a meal at the sushi samba locations in nyc, and maybe because i was a little hungover from the previous nights festivities, but i was not overly wowed by lunch here with two of my lady loves with whom i was vacationing. \n\none thing that is always a priority on vacation is food. it has to be, this is a break from the mundane life i leave behind, so why do i want to eat my standard weekly fare of life in the working world? i love sushi and because of it's nutritious nature figured this would be a great way to replenish all things lost to bottomless cocktails and greasy late night foods. i didn't partake in the consumption of any libations at lunch, but did hear that the mojito was pretty stellar.\n\ni ordered the trio <mark>Seaweed Salad</mark> that came beautifully presented on a three trayed dish of hijiki, wakame, and my favorite aka-tosaka. each were lightly dressed with lemon and sidelined with some tomato caviar. not terrible for a $11, but not overly substantial either. for lunch i ordered <mark>Yellowtail Jalapeno</mark> which was ok if not a little heavy on the jalapeno, and a <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> that was all sorts of bland. i think i would have been happier enjoying these as a happy hour because it seems that the prices are a little easier to swallow for the quality of the food. i didn't order anything complex, and maybe they just let the \"easy\" stuff slide, but i wasn't terribly enthused enough to want to go back and give it a second shot to see just how good the rest of the menu is according to the higher ratings given.", 
            "i came back to sushi samba over memorial day weekend and loved it so much that i actually ate there twice. the service and staff are incredible. everyone is really nice, especially the ladies at the bar. the happy hour menu is such a great deal too, $6 for everything (i think there's at least 8 different items to choose from, including 2 different drinks. i recommend the mojito). i loved the <mark>Salt and Pepper Squid</mark> (a better version of fried calamari), <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> roll, and the yellowtail seviche (it had a really nice ginger flavor to it). the kobe beef tacos were also amazing. as i mentioned in my previous review, the portions are not the biggest, but when you factor in that this is vegas, you are actually getting pretty good bang for your buck. \n\nthey should use maybe brighter lights inside though, it's kind of tucked away and easy to miss, in my opinion. people need to see this place!! :) \n\ngreat prices, great service. i will definitely be back! thanks sushi samba!", 
            "i don't believe it is possible to give a better rating.  we went to vegas for my wife's birthday.  the was our last night, and we wanted to go out for the last time.  we had already eating diner a couple of hours before hand.  so we figured we would go for a late night snack.  we went to sushi samba, and could not have made a better decision.\n\nwe were pretty indecisive about what to order.  so our waitress suggested that we answer a few of her questions, and she would suggest a meal for us.  that was perfect.  we had the yellow tail tacos which was delicious.  very light, and refreshing.  then we had the <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> skewers.  amazing sauce, and was great.  then we ended up with the <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark>.  great meal.  great suggestions.\n\nbut the topper was the owner liz.  she came over to our table.  she was very welcoming, and actually talked to us.  i didn't feel as if she was doing it, as part of some shtick.  she was very genuine.  which was cool. \n\nwe ended the night with a vanilla chocolate cake for my wife's birthday.  overall great experience.  when we go back to vegas.  this will definitively be one of our stops.", 
            "my friends and i came here for happy hour.  \n\nthere wasn't much room at the bar, but i found a single table in the bar.  i asked the hostess if we could sit there and she said yes but we had to order from the bar. i asked the hostess for menus and after she told me i had to order from the bar she said someone would be there to help me. errr...ok? my friend didn't hear any of this, but the bartender was nice and said instead of having us go up to the bar, she would have a waiter serve us.  the waiter who came was also really nice.\n\ni ordered a veggie tempura and <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> roll. the veggie tempura roll was one of the bigger dishes there and was pretty good. it came with a <mark><mark>Osetra Caviar Imperial 20g</mark> 20g</mark> and a creamy tangy sauce.  the <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> roll had really weird rice.  it was smashed together and wasn't sushi rice.  i'm not sure that it was even <mark>Steamed Japanese Rice</mark>.  i know this is a fusion restaurant but please don't f up sushi rice! \n\n3 stars might seem a little harsh for bad rice, but as a whole, i guess i just wasn't that impressed.  it wasn't bad, but it was def. a'ight.", 
            "my wife and i really liked sushi samba and their fushion menu.  we were running late for a show and couldn't wait to be seated in the main restaurant so we sat at the bar at the edge of the restaurant and the mall area as soon as something opened up.  lara s was our main waitress plus another girl and she was very friendly and helpful in selecting our drinks and menu items.  my wife and i are big st. germaine liquor fans and we loved the \"chu-cumber\" drink.  also thought the tempura green bean appetizer with truffle aioli sauce was yummie.  we had a sampling of sushi and pacific, <mark>El Topo</mark>, and <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> rolls and all was very good.", 
            "this was our go to late night place while staying at the venetian. we opted to sit at the bar and try their happy hour specials along with a few things off their menu.\n\ni woud highly recommend the miso chilean <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>, as it was once of the best i have ever had. the vegetables that came with it were so tender and delicious, even though i hate brussels sprouts, the rest were quite good.\n\nthe <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> rolls were really good also, though small compared to other places i've had them.\n\nthe best vegetable dish i've had in a long time were the collard greens in an asian dressing. they were crunchy and filling enough for two. though, next time i'm not sharing! \n\nanother stand out to me were the fried plantains. normally, restaurants cut them thick and serve them with sides of beans and sour cream. i loved that these were cut thin and lightly breaded, deep fried and sprinkled only with some shavings of cheese. \n\nbesides the <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>, the items we got were only $5-6 bucks a dish and easily can be split by two. this was probably my favorite place to dine while there and probably one of the better late night dining options you have if you don't feel like burgers or sandwiches.\n\ni would have loved to give them a full 5 stars but the bar people were much to slow in not only forgetting to ask our order but forgetting to bring us our drinks after having to ask  three times, while serving those who just sat down right away. otherwise, the food was fantastic!", 
            "date/time:  monday - 10pm\noccasion:  vegasaversary dinner after phantom \nparty of:  two\nlocation:  amongst the shoppes in palazzo.  interesting decor.  dark ambiance.\nordered:  roasted shishito peppers, hamachi tiradito, miso-glazed <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> skewers, <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> roll, <mark>Moqueca Mista</mark>, and trio of sorbet/ice cream (green tea, lychee, and vanilla)\ntotal incl gratuity: ~$110\n\ni am so stunned that sushi samba (ss) has an overall rating of 3.5!  it definitely deserved a 5 in my book.  was pretty blown away by all of their food.  i'm not usually that impressed with asian fusion but they deserve two thumbs up.  we arrived at 10pm and i was expecting it to be rather dead but it was still busy and happening.  all tables occupied, loud music bumping, and servers running around.\n\nthe bf and i decided on a few dishes to share.  everything on the menu ranged between $10 - $30.  granted we ordered a number of different items - for variety and sufficiency - we figured our dinner bill would be a little pricey.  seeing shisito peppers on the menu, i had to go for it.  i don't know what it is about these little things but i love them.  ss serves them grilled with a splash of lemon and seasalt.  a very good and light starter.  it actually went really well with the lemongrass sauce that was served with the hamachi tiradito.  don't even get me started on that lemongrass sauce. o.m.gee. i'm pretty sure there was a hint of crack in that thing because i was drinking that stuff.  it was so incredibly delicious.  when the waitress tried to take my plate away, she noticed how much i was savoring each drip of it so she brought me out a ramekin of it.  naturally i was dipping everything in that sauce.\n\nthe <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> skewers were just as delectable - melted in my mouth with the perfect flavor of miso.  highly recommend!  we noticed our neighbor ordered the <mark>Moqueca Mista</mark>. it looked delicious and we opted for it as well.  it was the perfect entree.  i couldn't have been more pleased.  the seafood was fresh and generous in portion.  the coconut lime flavor was delicious.\n\nseriously, ss is fantastic  i can't emphasize it enough.  since i've been back home, i've been telling everyone about this place. no joke!  one can only hope that they'll open one in sf.  i'm headed back to vegas in a week - making my way back there for sure!", 
            "we were promised a \"dining experience\", and that's what we got!\n\na group of 6 of us came here, and we were instantly charmed by our server, michael. he recommended a custom \"dining experience\" for about $50-60 per person, based on our likes and dislikes. food just kept coming out and we had no idea what to expect, but michael really hit the nail on the head with everything he picked for us.\n\nsome of the highlights:\n\n- yellowtail tacos\n- yellowtail in lemongrass sauce\n- <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> (i don't eat <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>, but my friends were raving about it!). the <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark> that came with it was excellent \n- some kind of steak, cooked medium rare served with rice and beans\n- a sushi platter with <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark>, california, and <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark> rolls\n\nsushisamba is really great for groups, and since you can customize a meal based on your budget, it can be relatively affordable, too. and every dish was amazing! i definitely recommend it, and hope to try brunch at one of their nyc locations.", 
            "came late night, super hungry after drinking and dancing. they have a happy hour menu late night i think between 11pm-2am $5 dollar mojitos, $5 caipirinha- which were amazing, they taste just like one straight from brazil. they also have <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> rolls and other rolls for $5 each. the vibe and atmosphere is great. bartender was very friendly and helpful.", 
            "this restaurant caught my eye because it was something out of the ordinary from your typical sushi restaurant. the menu offered an intriguing variety but when i began reading the reviews i knew i had to try it. i would suggest anyone going there for the first time to try the dining experience because you may think you know what you want but the chef knows better! the server asks if there is anything you do not like or if you have any food allergies and then how much money per person you're looking to spend. there are options anywhere from $50 per person to $130 per person if kobe beef if something that interests you. as it was for a special occasion we opted for $80 per person and even though thats more than i have probably ever spent on a single meal there were no regrets.\n\ncourse #1 consisted of berkshire pork gyoza which is basically pork dumplings in a pumpkin puree and yellowtail ceviche taquitos, both of which were absolutely delicious and not necessarily something i would have ordered on my own.\n\ncourse #2 was yellowtail sashimi in a spicy peruvian sauce with a slice of red jalapeno on top and octopus sashimi in a japanese citrus sauce which again were both to die for!\n\ncourse #3 had an array of <mark>Filet Mignon</mark>, <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>, <mark>Alaskan King Crab</mark> and <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark>. all were moist and tender but the <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> absolutely melted in your mouth! <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark> was a yummy alternative to <mark><mark>Osetra Caviar Imperial 20g</mark> 20g</mark> as well.\n\nfinally, course #4 was the main sushi dinner. <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark> rolls were delicious, but the <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> with i believe tuna on top was absolutely amazing! there was also <mark>Half Maine Lobster</mark> and another roll which i believe had lobster in it as well and was probably the only thing of the entire dinner that i was not absolutely amazed with, but it was still good!\n\nanother great thing about this place is they tell you if there is anything throughout this meal you do not like they will take it back and bring you something else! as our server said, \"its like a money back guarantee!\"\n\nanyways this is definitely a place i would tell everyone who loves trying new things to try or even just the sushi lover. do it! it will not disappoint!\n\nonly part i would complain about is the fact that there is not one in california!!!", 
            "i had a quick dinner with some work colleagues at sushi samba the night we arrived at the hotel. the wait on a sunday night was about 45 minutes ... so we asked if we could sit/eat at the bar. they said it was fine and were promptly seated.\n\nwe ordered 3 sushi rolls and 1 entree along with a couple of beers and one cocktail. for three people our bill was well over $100 and we didn't really have that much to eat. the service at the bar was friendly, but unattentive ... they seemed more interested in talking with each other than the customers that night. it was good, but i can't see paying $14+ for \"specialty\" rolls and $8-9 for a standard <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> roll that you can get at a very good sushi restaurant for $5-6 anywhere other than on the strip in vegas. i know ... it's vegas, everything is expensive ... but $100 for a few rolls and an entree is a bit excessive.", 
            "i want to like this place so much.  the food that we got was delicious (the <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> skewers are amazingly soft and flaky, and the black truffle sauce that comes with the fried green beans is tdf), but the service we got was horrible.  our server was fine--she was upbeat and tried to work with our wants, but whomever it was that also talked to us was horrible.  \n\nto be fair, we were a large group (about 14 or 15), and understandably it is hard to accommodate such a large group, let alone trying to get our food out at the same time.  honestly, i could care less if my food came out at the same time as the people i had been sitting with.  before we could even look at the menus to see what was available a la carte, the restaurant pushed us into this 'tasting menu' that would \"incorporate our tastes as well as some of their classic dishes\"--sounds fine, but in a group of 14 or 15 people who have very varied tastes, that is almost impossible to do.  to begin with, some of our group members didn't eat any raw fish, and others were basically only interested in raw fish.  we eventually agreed to this tasting menu just out of an unwillingness to continue \"fighting\".  they tried to appease by sending us some shooters and edamame, grilled shishito peppers, and fried green beans to start.  great, and thanks, but still not the best service you could ask for at a restaurant like here. \n\nif this rating were about the food only, i would give it 5 stars.  the food really is delicious, and the decor (while strange) goes well with the feel that the restaurant seems to be going for.  the pork in our meat sampler platter was overdone and dry, but two types of beefs that were perfectly cooked made up for it.  the appetizer of some sort of spicy tempura rock shrimp salad was moist with the perfect amount of chewiness and spring; it's spicy, but not in the give-me-milk-to-guzzle-now way.  the sushi that we were served, however, was pretty sub-standard.  i'm sure this was because it had to fall in line with our tasting menu price point (which somehow got haggled down); honestly, i did not come to sushisamba just to get <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> rolls.. i could get that anywhere. \n\nin short, come here if you're in a small group.  the food really is worth it, many times over.  i'm sure it will be a far more amazing trip than the one i had in a large group.", 
            "the dinner was fantastic. i had a hard time choosing so i had the waitress choose. she picked the <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> sushi.  pork gioza, <mark>Salt and Pepper Squid</mark>, <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>. everything was great until we decided not to have dessert. the waitress's attitude completely changed.", 
            "their signature roll saved them from a 2 star review.  reading the reviews and consistency of solid reviews, i thought i found the spot!  once there, the overpriced menu and sake list reminded me i was in vegas, a place that should not have to be this expensive, i mean come on, people are handing money hand over fist at the tables, don't gouge us at the restaurants.  nigiri was priced per piece at a rate higher than i'm used to paying for 2 pieces.  the rolls were decent, i liked the <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> version they served, a little <mark>Uni</mark>, the eel avocado was good.  my main complaint is that they are a decent sushi spot, nothing extraordinary, and their prices are simply too high.  however, the samba roll, with <mark>Half Maine Lobster</mark>, mango and some other delightful flavors that created a party on my palate, bumped them to 3 stars.  great roll, $19, but that one was special.", 
            "i almost want to give this a 5. near oh my god moment, but not quite.\n\nthis is a little misleading. i swear this came up under \"chinese\" on yelp while we were looking for something (in a group <mark><mark>Assortment of Four</mark></mark>) but this is definitely not chinese. it's japanese brazilian fusion, which i had never had, but was awesome. the menu is a bid daunting, but the waitress offered to bring out a tasting menu for us, based on the common questions like, \"are you ok with raw fish,\" \"do you have allergies,\" \"how do you eat red meat,\" etc. this was helpful - usually i'm not fazed by the large menu, but for some reason i was having problems focusing. worth mentioning they say up front that they'll take back anything we don't like, no charge, and they do ask for a budget to keep them in line.\n\nwhat we got was really pretty exceptional. gyoza steamed and pan fried, hamachi taquitos (not what you're thinking - not the deep fried rolls, but little taco shells filled with hamachi sashimi), seared tuna with baby greens and crunchy salt, and portabella fries with kabocha aioli. all sounds fancy, all really good.\n\nthen a warm plate - grilled <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> with a sweet glaze, <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> (not their a5 w<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark>, which we were offered for an upcharge, but declined) and <mark><mark>Alaskan King Crab</mark> Leg</mark>, all with a side of elote. the bass was good - tender and flaky, and i like the glaze. but it was crazy overpowered by the beef and crab. firstly, the beef was far superior to what we had at n9ne. tender, flavorful, and with a great salt and pepper crust on the outside, served with a little pile of powdered chile for dipping. and the crab was that near oh my god moment. an *enormous* <mark><mark>Alaskan King Crab</mark> Leg</mark>, brushed with a sort of thick butter sauce, served piping hot. wow, this was exceptional. and while i guess i should expect it, points to the restaurant for realizing that serving a filet and a <mark><mark>Alaskan King Crab</mark> Leg</mark> family style to diners that have only chopsticks required that you slice things up in to nice little bite sized pieces.\n\nfinally, sushi. their <mark>Neo Tokyo</mark> roll, which is their version of the <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark>, a hamachi roll with spicy crab and avocado on top, a tuna roll with asparagus, dusted with wasabi, and an assortment of sashimi and nigiri. as well as a hot roll - something covered in melted mozzarella, crispy onions and a sweet sauce. all of the cold rolls were good - i especially liked their <mark>Neo Tokyo</mark> roll. the sashimi was also very good, but the hot roll...i could do without. it was in interesting twist - not just the cheese was hot, but the entire roll, rice and all. however, the cheese and a heaping helping of onion and sauce overpowered whatever might have been inside. this was about the only misstep i could find.\n\nthe atmosphere is odd - lots of pounding techno music, along with an odd video collage (on many many video screens) of brazilian beach babes, bullet trains, brazilian slums, and japanese salarymen trudging to their soul-murdering jobs. not sure what they were going for. but whatever.\n\ngreat spot - chinese though it wasn't, we all were appropriately full when it was over (not hungry, no stuffed) and we all agreed we'd be back. the total bill, excluding drinks, was probably about $65 per person. i loved the mix of appetizers, hot beef and seafood, and sushi. if you're going with a group, this is a fun way to try stuff without having to worry about reading a menu.",

            "my mother and i are came here last sunday for happy hour.  the sushi was absolutely delicious- fresh with decent portion sizes.  we particularly liked that they don't use a lot of rice  in lieu of other ingredients like many sushi restaurants. we tried several dishes from the happy hour menu at $6 each:\n\n<mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> roll - good not not too different from other <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> rolls we tried\n<mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark> roll - good portions of <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark> and not too greasy\nsalmon sushi - great flavor with asparagus.  this was my mother's favorite.\njapanese style <mark>Salt and Pepper Squid</mark> - a bit salty but quite tasty.  small portion.\nyellowtail seviche- two thinly sliced yellowtail with a tasty spicy sauce.  this was my favorite.\n\nin addition, we ordered the california roll which was $14.  however,  they used real crab instead of imitation crab.  it was quite tasty with generous amounts of crab used.  \n\nthe service was good.  the restaurant itself is dark with several televisions positioned around- they don't show sports just a program about sushi.  it would be even better if they had a television at the bar for sports.",

            "a pretty good sushi spot in vegas. it is really pricy for the kind of rolls, but you can tell everything is very fresh and has a lot of flavor. we got a yellow-tail roll, a custom crab and lobster roll, the sushisamba roll, and a <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> roll, also a plate of chicken teriyaki. the sushi for the most part was really good! the chicken teriyaki was decent, but nothing all that amazing considering it cost $26 for that plate. the servers are very informative on the dishes and are super friendly. they offer good advice and are pretty quick to serve. if you ask for the chef to make a custom roll with crab and lobster, the creations are usually really good! highly suggest doing that! \n\ntldr: good sushi spot, but a bit pricy.", 
            "wandered in here without a plan for a first time meet up.\n\nthough my eyes were not necessarily on the food, i noted a few things, sitting at a table vs. sitting at the sushi bar: the emphasis was on the fusion foods (sushi menu was backpage) and the drink menu was bigger than the food menu. i agree with bunny g. that no one bothered to explain anything about the menus.\n\nordered their house ice tea which is a mint tea arnold palmer, served with lemon & lime wedges.  very tasty & refreshing since i don't think i've ever had an arnie with mint tea.\n\nthe edamame was standard fare, served cool with crushed rock salt sprinkled on top.  i ordered 2 rolls, <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark> (6 pcs), and a <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> (8 pcs).  the <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark> was exactly that, no fuss, frills, standouts.  the <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark>, i think was just a tuna roll served with a squirt of sriracha.  good thing i wasn't there for the food!\n\nthe decor & service were exceptional and it looked like there was a special/private dining area in the back.  interesting decor that isn't particular of any single culture, or at least any that i know of.  there were these wooden chairs that looked to be carved out of giant coconuts but could really only seat an ommpa loompa.  another strange touch, that doesn't quite work to me: the food menus were not on the small side, but the cover was like leather, as in, not self supporting.  the only way to read the menu, that didn't feel awkward, was to lay it on the table.  for some reason, i didn't want a leather menu touching my little appetizer plate.  it seems unsanitary.\n\nbecause the prices were so high, i rate the food a 2-2.5 stars, but the decor & service a solid 4 stars.  so, 3.33 stars, it is!", 
            "great ambiance, decent food.\na lot of people have recommended this restaurant, but i think it's a bit overrated. \ni love sushi.  although the sushi was well presented, they didn't taste like anything spectacular.  surprisingly not too many rolls to choose from even though they try to create some original specialty rolls.  \n\n<mark>Neo Tokyo</mark> roll - <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> inside, tuna outside.  this roll was just ok.  it just tastes like <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark>.\n\n<mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> skewers - probably our only favorite dish.  comes with corn.\n\n<mark>El Topo</mark> roll - good, sorta like a crunchy roll, crispy onions and mayo on top.\n\n<mark>Berkshire Pork Belly</mark> ramen - highly recommended by server, but a huge disappointment.  it was a failed attempt.  the broth was clear and bland.  it tasted like instant ramen with a hint of tom yum soup flavoring.  nothing like ramen at all.  \n\nsushisamba has good food, it just didn't show me anything new or exciting except that you're in a really nice restaurant, but you're paying for it.",

            "food is good. prices are not.\n\n- <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>: $29 miso glazed and pretty freakin delicious. cooked perfectly also. but the portion was probably 3 maybe 4 bites at most.\n\n- handrolls: we had salmon skin, salmon and avocado, <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark>, and yellowtail. the ingredients were fresh, but the rolls were very small and about ~$8-$10/each.\n\n- various rolls: we tried the yamato ($19 for 3 pieces). there wasn't even enough for me to get a chance to try it since there were only 3 pieces lol, but my friends said it was probably the best roll there. pure decadence being topped with <mark>Foie Gras</mark>, caviar, and gold flakes. we also tried a few other rolls for which i can't remember the names (sorry!) but they had <mark>Seared W<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> Beef</mark> and another had <mark>Half Maine Lobster</mark>. both were interesting, but i wasn't blown away.\n\n- nigiri: fresh but again, extremely pricey! $5-$10 a piece! yup, not an order of 2 pieces...that price is per piece! o_o\n\n- sides: we ordered the corn and plantains at $7 each. the corn was delicious but a very small portion in a cup. same thing with plantains. grilled deliciously but only a few slices for a whopping $7.\n\nif you haven't gotten the undertone of my review yet, it's that this place is expensive! lol we each paid roughly $50/person and no one left feeling full. it wouldn't have been so bad had the service been better though. we were missing a few things at the table and had to ask several times for it (place setting, water, and soy sauce dishes).", 
            "my boyfriend took me and another couple here for this past valentines day. \n\nit was super empty at 8:30 pm on valentines night which i thought was really weird. \n\ni'll start off by saying service was impeccable. even the manager came over to check on us and wish us a happy valentines day and even chatted it up with us for a little while. he even brought some kind of champagne with strawberries for us at the end of our dinner. i believe his name was jeremy so if i'm correct....then thanks jeremy you definitely made our experience a good one. kudos to philip our waiter as well. he dealt with our drunk asses throughout the entire dinner and provided amazing service at the same time. \n\nwe ordered an order of the <mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> to try. yeh we ended up ordering another 4 orders right away. i think that might give you a good idea of just how amazing this dish is. i can guarantee you won't be disappointed with it. then we got the churrasco with like 3 or 4 different meats that came with 3 different sauces. if you've got money to spend then i definitely suggest getting this dish. the <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> hand roll with spicy mayo on top was also amazing. hands down the best <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> hand roll i've ever had. \n\nthe two downsides to this place and the reason i took off one star is because of how pricy this place is for the amount of food they give you and the fact that their bathroom had absolutely no lights. i literally couldn't see where i was or what i was doing the entire time i was in the stall. \n\noverall if i have a lot or extra cash to spend then i will most definitely be back for the great service and especially another helping of the <mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> and <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> hand roll.", 
            "my girlfriend and i stayed at the venetian and came here after watching cirque du soliel: zarkana at aria on 05-11-14. i found this restaurant on yelp before we came. i absolutely love sushi and she hates it. we both love texas de brazil so i figured a good compromise would be a churrascaria crossed with a sushi bar so we picked sushi samba. i always like to find the most expensive roll at sushi bars and try it so i picked the s\\u00c3o paulo for $24. it had <mark>Scallop</mark>, masago, red onion, tuna, salmon, shrimp, yellowtail, avocado, truffle, hacho miso soy, chive oil inside. to be honest the red onion over powered the flavor of every other ingredient and kind of ruined it for me. this is coming from someone that loves onions too. if i come back i'll probably ask them to cut that out when i order. i also ordered a generic <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> roll. for our two sharable sides we ordered <mark>Purple Potato Mash</mark> and <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark>. the two sides were the best thing at this restaurant. the <mark>Purple Potato Mash</mark> had a rich buttery taste and creamy texture that melted in my mouth. the <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark> had a perfect amount of sweetness and the texture was lightly firm just the way i like. the real downside of the meal though is that my girlfriend decided to order the <mark>Berkshire Pork Belly</mark> rather than the <mark>Lamb Chop</mark> she was thinking about. i asked if she was sure she wanted that and she said yes. i neglected to mention to her that <mark>Berkshire Pork Belly</mark> is literally a seared section of fat. she was not pleased, but didn't want to order anything else when her food arrived. my girlfriend was actually quite content with the <mark>Purple Potato Mash</mark> and <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark>. overall the experience was pretty good except for the group of 3 drunk russian speaking call girls (assuming) seated next to us that were intent on yelling over the music the entire time they were there instead of leaning in to hear one another. but, hey if you aren't hearing a drunk person screaming in another language next to you at most of the places you're at then you aren't experiencing vegas the right way. ha!", 
            "i am so glad we had the chance to dine at sushisamba our last night in vegas! our waiter michael was fantastic and made the entire experience that much more memorable. we literally loved everything we ordered. be sure to make a reservation because it gets very busy, and if you're celebrating anything let the hostess know. we were celebrating our wedding anniversary and they gave us a free small dessert.\n\nsmall plates:\n<mark>Seared W<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> Beef</mark> goyza - do not miss this! it was incredible - every table around us had also ordered it and we were in unanimous agreement.\n\nyellowtail crispy taquitos - light & delicious with an asian dressing on the greens.\n\nrobata:\nribeye - it's described as spicy but it's not, just has subtle spic flavoring and was very tender.\n\n<mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> - phenomenal. there's a reason it's the most popular thing on the menu. melts in your mouth with an amazing miso glaze.\n\nsamba rolls:\n<mark>Neo Tokyo</mark>: similar to a <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> roll flavor but with tuna both inside and on top of the roll. fresh and great flavor.\n\ndessert: \nfried doughnuts with cream dipping sauce - oh my goodness, sooo good. not a light dessert (fried dough) but ah-ma-zing.\n\nsince we were celebrating our wedding anniversary, they gave us a free small dessert of green tea ice cream pops dipped in chocolate with pop candy crust, which was cool and refreshing.\n\nwe will definitely be back on our next trip!", 
            "i'm giving 5 stars because the sushi was fantastic, and the dishes were creative and inspired. love the brazilian fusion. tried two kinds of sashimi ceviche, both delicious. <mark>Scallop</mark> were amazing. had some salmon and yellowtail sashimi that was fresh and perfect. and, a special take on a <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> roll that was unbelievable. the service was fine. not thrilling, but perfectly serviceable.", 
            "this is a review of their happy hour (4-7pm and 11pm until close).\n\nthe skinny: spent $50+ on sub par peruvian influenced japanese food (2.5), service: was slow when we wanted to leave (3) value: seeing as there was only 1 dish out of 8 that we would get again, we won't likely be back (3).\n\nwe were excited to see that they had a happy hour menu while meandering through the venetian properties. we thought great! if the food is good during happy hour, we'll come back another time and try their other regularly priced dishes. \n\nso we ordered 8 out of 10 ($6)items on their happy hour menu. of the 8, we'd probably get only 1 item again. the rest was pretty mediocre considering how much they charge for each dish and the level of cuisine.\n\nwe should have known. i mean when the first dish - yellowtail tiradito - came out, i knew it wasn't going to be good. the thinly sliced 2 pieces of yellowtail were drowning in a pepper sauce. i really couldn't taste the flavor of the fish at all. definitely not well balanced. \n\n<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> (3 pieces) with kabocha puree was okay. although the beef had a wonderful smokiness to it, the gyoza were disappointingly undersalted even after dunking in a good amount of soy sauce. the kabocha squash was relatively flavorless which surprised me after reading reviews about this dish.\n\nchicken anticuchos (2 skewers)were not bad although they weren't particularly memorable either. the meat, slightly grilled/charred, was not crispy enough texturally although it was adequately seasoned.\n\neggplant anticuchos with a side of <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark> was okay. i dug the slightly herbaceous kick of the chiffonated mint or basil, cutting the sweetness of the soy based sauce. however the eggplant was a tinge on the tougher side and needed to be roasted with more oil to give it a better texture.  the <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark> is definitely not one of my favorite foods. potato-like in taste and texture, the chef was able to infuse some acidity to make it more flavorful. it was more palatable with the hit of citrus but still, nothing i needed to try again.\n\nthe sushi (veggie kun - kind of like futomaki, ezo roll - meager amounts of salmon/asparagus with a ton of panko breadcrumbs mixed in = bad mouth feel, and <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> - acceptable but nothing exciting) was the most lackluster portion of our meal. considering rice composes about 50% of sushi, it was highly disappointing to find it overly mushy and over seasoned. it kind of ruined it for me. factor in the high rice to filling ratio, i cannot recommend any sushi dish made here. this is rather unfor<mark>Tuna</mark> because sushi comprises at least a significant portion of the menu.\n\nthe only highlight of the meal was the <mark>Salt and Pepper Squid</mark>. melt-in-your-mouth tender pieces of squid with a delicate batter, this was the one dish that the hubs and i truly enjoyed.\n\nfood service was surprisingly and perhaps questionably prompt. there was a small gap in service with our last dish but it wasn't too bad. it was unfor<mark>Tuna</mark> that the bar service was slower than expected and easily overwhelmed. after our meal, we just wanted to get the check processed and go. however, a loud obnoxious group of women (aka the skanky looking anti-milfs who obviously collected club wristbands) completely commandeered her attention with to go orders. the two other bartenders were milling around but did not help her. so the hubs had to endure some random, potentially contagious woman's behind rubbing against his left leg while she took orders from other groups of people. he was highly grumpy after being mauled and ignored.\n\nin reality, this joint rates about a 2.5 however i rounded up to a three based on the fact that there was 1 dish which was truly outstanding. however, given our experience, we are not likely to return. 3 starred review.", 
            "by far the best sushi, sashimi, tempura, green tea i've had. great service! do try the <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> roll! totally recommended!", 
            "i love sushisamba! i was very familiar with the london location and this was actually my 2nd visit to the vegas location. the food never disappoints at either venue and if you are new to the brand i would recommend having the server either order for you or working closely with them to craft your own \"tasting menu\".  the concept of japanese, peruvian and brazilian can be intimidating and unfamiliar to most but you have to just go with it! \n\nwe let the manager, jason p, order for us and we couldn't have been happier! he was super friendly and asked about any allergies and dietary restrictions and got everything on point. we had an assortment of small plates: <mark>Green Bean Tempura</mark>, edamame, pardon peppers, a <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> roll, some <mark>Crispy Hokkaido Scallop</mark> lettuce wrap, assorted taquitos of yellow tail / lobster / crab and <mark>Mushroom Tobanyaki</mark> with <mark>Duck Breast</mark>. everything was cooked and seasoned perfectly and the staff even made a point to let us know which items to eat first to enjoy at the best possible temperature. everyone we encountered was friendly, engaging, knowledgeable on the menus and so hospitable! \n\nto sum it up, jason p and the whole ss team know what they're freaking doing and i can't wait to go back!", 
            "close to perfect as a sushi restaurant can be here at the palazzo. a tad high priced but it's las vegas. even the basic <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> roll is outstanding! the yellowtail tacos are delicious and the cocktails are fresh. two thumbs up!", 
            "i love sushisamba. i always come when in vegas. i was there on a sunday for lunch . we started with the anticuchos with <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark>... these were amazing!  the corn was much bigger than american corn and garnished with some sweet sauce. their sushi is always delicious and fresh i love their salmon roll  and <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> were my favorite .the staff was super friendly and the food came out super fast. always happy to come here.", 
            "so we just finished a late night meal here. i consider me and my fianc\\u00e9 to be sushi connoisseurs. we found it to be just 'meh. but than again, we have been blown away at other restaurants and after all this is a chain....\n\nanyway, we got here after 11pm and were seated. we specifically came here for the happy hour but were told after being seated, happy hour menu is at the bar only. you mean the 15 seat bar? we don't drink so i declined. not to forget, it's no where stated on the menu... our mediocre late night snack came to $70....\n\nshould stuck to my rule of only dining where the locals go. \n\n<mark>Salt and Pepper Squid</mark>- good. not overly fried. lime was nice touch.\n\n<mark>Samba Strip</mark>, <mark>Salmon Avocado</mark> and <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark>... nothing fancy and have had way better.",

            "had lunch here for the first time.  nothing that blew me out of the water but very interesting flavors.  yellowtail tacos were well done with the spicy foam sauce. yellowtail ceviche and salmon ceviche- maybe i was expecting fresh surprise like nobu's flavored sashimi but it fell quite a bit short. their <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> was okay but not great. <mark><mark>Osetra Caviar Imperial 20g</mark> 20g</mark> was excellent where you can taste the freshness.  my favorite was the tempura green beans.  it was fun trying all these new flavors.  i would recommend for as an adventure.",

            "we started our happy hour with several nina frescas and classic mojitos.  fresh strawberry pur\\u00e9e, vodka, orange liquor, and guava.  spectacular and they were only $6 each. next we sampled <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> roll, <mark>Salt and Pepper Squid</mark>, w<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> goya, <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark> roll, chicken anticuchos, and yellow tiradito sashimi. everything was amazingly prepared and all of our choices were perfectly flavored. we sat at the bar and brian explained the menu in detail, recommended drinks, and made sure our service was on point.  everyone at the restaurant was friendly and focused on customer service.  the music and atmosphere was hip and entertaining.  we will be back on our next vegas trip. you can also ask for jason; he will make sure that all of your detailed requests are handled."

            "wow! i'll start off with that. this place was very good and the dining experience here was great.  a buddy and i sat at the sushi bar, the lady brought us over the menu, we browse it, deciding what to get and really couldn't decide.  the server stops by and explains some items and then also mentions we have the chef's choice (omakase) and we hesitate for a minute and sure, we'll take two.\n\nthe first course was string beans tempura, boring right?  no, the truffle aioli sauce that came with this was amazing.  i can't even explain the taste, it was really good.  you can drink it with a straw.  \n\nthe second course pork gyoza, sitting on a squash puree of some sort, i want to say butternut squash or something similar.  these were ok, nothing special.  the <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark> was delicious, nice spicy mayo sauce on top.  and the last component was a yellowtail taquito.  i liked these and it was served with a spicy sriracha sauce of some sort.\n\nthird course was meat heaven.  grilled pork tenderloin, hanger steak, and ribeye.  woo-wee!  i have to say though, some of the ribeye was a little charred, particularly the end pieces, but the middle was done right, medium-rare.  the hanger steak was good, tender and chunks of fat, good stuff.  the pork loin was awesome.  this dish is served with three sauces, two types of chimichurri and some peruvian pepper puree sauce that was unreal!  the pork fit so perfectly with this sauce, so recommended for anyone.  the chimichurri was so-so, not so great, but still good.\n\nthe last course consisted of rolls.  they have a special spicy yellowtail tuna roll with tempura flakes, but i thought this was ok, i've had better.  then a simple salmon and avocado and eel and avocado.  i've had the eel/avocado mixture many times, but i must say this is the best i've had.  the typical black sauce that's topped on was really good.  it had a sweet taste to it and all the flavors meshed oh so well.  good stuff.\n\nmy companion was done as we had so much food.  i decided to take a dive and get some dessert.  it was a chocolate, white chocolate pudding/custard type consistency and some crushed chocolate granola on the bottom.  it was ok, not that good.\n\noverall, great spot and recommended.  the chef's choice isn't as steep as all vs nobu and morimoto's (where i've had both).  you get the \"fusion-ness\" from the peruvian and brazilian influence.  luckily there's a few on the east coast in nyc, so i don't have to travel as far.", 
            "i have been craving this place ever since i left vegas. seriously. so good. \n\nmy fave items were:\n-coconut <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark>. each shrimp was perfect, crisp, delicious... topped with a bit of pureed truffle. mmmm\n-miso <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> satay... so tender, buttery, delicious.\n\nthe place was a bit over priced but those two items made my night. every single item we got was delicious.", 
            "amazing. the <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> with miso and raw <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark> were quite delectable. the only thing i kinda found sketchy about this place were the images on the projectors and tv.. great place overall though.", 
            "this restaurant is a chain and was pretty good.\n\nbeing a girls weekend away from home, we started off with their cocktail tree which is $70, but totally worth it! then we ordered otsumami which is an assortment of edamame, <mark>Green Bean Tempura</mark>, and shishito which was really good. their aioli sauce had a hint of truffles and a strong garlic taste but wasn't too over powering and made it really good with the <mark>Green Bean Tempura</mark>.\n\nafter that we had the <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark> that had bibb lettuce, tobanjan alioli, black truffle vinaigrette and in my opinion was only average. for my entree i had the miso-marinated chilean <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> and that was really, really good. very moist, tender, juicy and not fishy at all. it's everything you could wish your fish to be. the portion was a little small, but it was oh, so good!! i also had the <mark>Samba Strip</mark> roll which had <mark>Half Maine Lobster</mark>, mango, tomato, chive, crispy rice, soy paper, peanut curry and i thought it was alright. but for the price and how much lobster they gave us, it was really worth it.  the last thing i had was their <mark>Neo Tokyo</mark> roll that had yellowfin tuna, tempura flake, aji panca, which is also really good. \n\nmy overall experience was only a 3 stars because they said they were really busy that night (but didn't look that way to me because there were at least 5 empty tables in front of us) and they sat us in a corner and our waiter was a complete douche and couldn't get our order right nor could he remember what we ordered and came back on several occasions to reconfirm what we ordered. the manager there was also dumb and tried to help out only to make things worse because he asked us what we wanted to drink and didn't even bring our drinks and completely forgot about us. \n\nin the end, i'd come back cause the food was good, but hopefully i'll get better service next time.", 
            "we stopped here for a little lunch during happy hour on our trip.  the atmosphere of this place was awesome, i really liked the decor as well.  a very modern looking establishment.  \n\nthe happy hour menu is limited, but not bad at all.\n\nfor happy hour my wife and i got the <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> roll, a philly roll, <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark> roll, and chicken anticuchos.  i loved the chicken anticuchos.  super tasty, tender pieces of chicken with a nice teriyaki sauce.  the <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> roll was spicy.  spicier than what i'm used to.  i wasn't big on the <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark> mainly because if i'm eating sashimi or rolls, i like it cold. i just dont jive to well on warm sushi haha.  when it comes to warm fish, bbq salmon or halibut is my game.\n\nwe both ordered drinks, i ordered a mojito and the wife had a caiprianha.  the mojito i had wasn't working for me.  it was awesome they put fresh mint in it, but i hated getting foliage in my mouth.  also, it was rather strong.....i like a strong drink trust me, but something was different about the strength of this drink.  same on the caiprianha.  texas de brazil made an awesome caiprianha, so i dont know what was so different between the 2.\n\nwe did end up spending around 50 bucks at happy hour which was a shock.  we did enjoy it, and it is totally worth a stop.", 
            "me and a couple buds of mine decided it would be a good idea to fine dine before heading back home from our trip to vegas. i found this spot out by a buddy of mine who happens to be a local, so i took his word for it and made a reservation here. it took us quite a while to get seated... we probably had to wait 20-30 minutes or so to get seated even though we had a reservation (it was a saturday, not quite sure how it would be on any other days).\n\nanyway our waitor was nice.. very knowledgable and friendly. the food was so yum. the boyfriend and i ordered a whole bunch of things- <mark>Rainbow Dragon</mark> roll, tiger <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark>, <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>, uni sushi, and after reading the previous reviews here on yelp, we ordered the yellowtail taquitos... so glad we did because they were delicious! pretty pricey for a small taco but totally worth it. the minimum you could order is 2 and they're $6 each. definitely would come back here for the taquitos and the sake!", 
            "it's like eating sushi at a night club. really good sushi.\n\nthe ambiance is very contemporary with tons of lamps hanging from the ceiling. lighting is minimal. \n\nhere's the breakdown of the food that i tried.\n\n<mark>Tuna Tataki</mark>: very good. super fresh. i can't say it was the best that i have had but very close to it.\n\n<mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark>: this was an absolute favorite at the table. you have to try this! it's like tempura popcorn shrimp covered in a spicy alioli. \n\n<mark>Rio Grande</mark> three meats: all the meats were good. the dipping sauces made them fantastic. i wouldn't get this again though. not really great for how much it is.\n\nbobo brazil roll: really good! kobe beef on top....yum!\n\npacific: this was ok. nothing special about it. \n\nservice was fantastic! there was always someone out refilling glasses of water, beer, and sake and clearing out plates. very friendly too.", 
            "a friend of mine was raving about ss which set my expectations a bit high since he was industry folk but my experience was ok, sadly.  the space was cool in a japanimation type of way.  the temperature was a bit warm for a casino and music a bit blaring for my taste.  but what it really comes down to is the food, right?  the food was ok but not bad.  the <mark>Berkshire Pork Belly</mark> was incredibly delicious but the <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark> with truffle was soggy and didn't have the bite and crispy goodness a tempura typically has.  i just expected a bit more out of this brand name and really didn't do it for me.  i probably wouldn't go back.  there are plenty of other restaurants in vegas that are worth betting on.", 
            "went there for happy hour on a wed night. it was pretty dead by the time we got there. didn't like the mojito...  even though it was$6 only. the <mark>Salt and Pepper Squid</mark> was good. veggie tempura decent, chicken skewer was good and <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark> roll was terrible. service was pretty good.  enjoy", 
            "my dad picked out this place to go to dinner when he was in town this weekend.  i had never been, and i love sushi, so i was totally ok with his choice.\n\nwe arrived and looked at the menu, but ended up not needing it as we settled on the option our server gave to us... tell her our likes and dislikes, and they'd make a custom menu for us to try a bunch of everything.\n\nwhat followed was a lot of food that we would have never ordered... and we were delighted at the items they brought us.  our favorite was the chilean <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>, which was so tasty.  it came with <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark>, which is like huge overgrown corn.  we also really enjoyed the yellowtail seviche taquitos and the <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark>, as well as a few of the numerous sushi rolls they had brought at the end.  and our meal also included giant <mark><mark>Alaskan King Crab</mark> Leg</mark>, some peruvian sashimi, and at least one or two dishes i'm failing to remember.\n\nthe music was a little loud and not to my dad's taste, but that's typical in vegas.  the meal was definitely a <mark>Uni</mark> experience, and we wouldn't have stumbled upon half the dishes without letting the chef do his thing.  i highly recommend you dine in this fashion if you visit sushi samba.", 
            "excellent food, but it comes at a price. my boyfriend and i came here for what was supposed to be a light lunch, but we spent over $80 and still left hungry! but it's vegas, and it certainly wasn't the most expensive restaurant we came across. the menu didn't have as many sushi options as we expected- just the basics and a small list of specialty rolls. but there was a good variety of other fusion dishes, which seems to be the restaurant's main focus.\n\nmy boyfriend started off with the sawagani, which is flash fried japanese river crabs. basically, they're small (~1 inch) fried crabs that you eat whole. there was no way i was touching those things! i had the <mark>Tuna Tataki</mark>, which was very fresh and came in a tasty sauce.  we shared the <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark>, which came in larger sized pieces, and the <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> roll. both tasted fine. \n\nfor drinks, my boyfriend tried one of their shochus (not soju), a japanese drink similar to sake but tastes like vodka. prices ranged from $10-15 a glass, and it was pretty potent for a lightweight like me.\n\nservice was great. our server was attentive and had no problem explaining the items on the menu. atmosphere-wise, the interior has a nice, modern decor, but the music is really loud, and the lighting is very dim. overall, we had a good dining experience, and i would recommend trying this place if you have some money to spend!", 
            "my opinion/side note - i dont think its their sushi that makes this a good place to eat. but its the dishes that are not other sushi restaurant menus that makes it worth the cost.\n\nthis place is really good, only if you order the right things, because ordering something bad can cost you a pretty penny. i have been here twice and the 2nd time was much better because we all knew what we liked. \n\nthe chilean <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> on the robata grill section was probably my favorite rendition of chilean <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>. our waiter said the robata grill costs $1000 a day to operate? something like that. but wow it was good. you have to order off of this part of the menu if you are a fan of grilled food.\nprobably the only time i felt like a winner in vegas all weekend, just playing, kinda, lol.\n\nthe yellowfin taquitos were so <mark>Uni</mark>, and the foam chili sauce that came with it was the perfect compliment.\n\n<mark>El Topo</mark> - good but not great. table loved it though.\n\n<mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark> with black truffle aoili - if i ever make my dream of opening up a restaurant come true - this will be the first item on the menu. wowwww. it made a shrimp convert out of 1 the people at our table. but really how can u not like shrimp?\n\n\n-p", 
            "i had the chance to go back this past weekend and got a completely  different experience the second time around at sushi samba. \n\nafter a fun filled weekend adventure in vegas, we decided to give ss another shot. it was my cousin's birthday, and we figured we would stop by for a farewell vegas-birthday dinner. we stayed at the venetian, which made ss a stone throw away. we couldn't have came at a better time, the environment was so much more personal than the time before. i highly recommend avoiding peak dining hours if possible. this will give you time to enjoy your meal while getting some extra attention from servers. since we arrived at around 4pm on a sunday, the timing was perfect. \n\nour party grabbed a couple dishes and shared them all. this was the perfect way to sample everything. we started our mission into japanese/peruvian/brazilian adventure with...\n\notsumami: a mix of three appetizers. edamame, fried green beans, and grilled shishito peppers. my absolute favorite was the shishito peppers. they were doused in sea salt and lemon, and one out of every couple were spicy. perfect mix to the subtle hues of the edamame. \n\nyellowtail seviche: little tiny tacos filled with a mixture of yellowtail, onions, avocado and a side of chile sauce. these little babies packed a flavorful punch!\n\nnext up was the smoked <mark><mark>Alaskan King Crab</mark> Leg</mark>: wood fired, served in the half shell, perfectly cut and smothered in a signature sauce. these were so delicious and just melted in my mouth like butter!\n\nround four, <mark>Broiled Peruvian Bay Scallop</mark>: served in the shell as well, perfectly cooked. you can tell that they know how to prepare their seafood because everything tasted so fresh. this was my cousin's favorite dish and her first time ever trying <mark>Scallop</mark>. \n\nthen came out the <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark>. we could hardly eat anymore, however we asked for the most flavorful, scrumptious items, and intended on finishing them! after that, the yellowtail sashimi. it had spicy blended orange sauce on it, that was the perfectly paired with the fish. my personal fave of the night. \n\nmake sure to order a signature cocktail while you are there. we had a couple (after all, what kind of birthday is complete without drinks?), and the one that really stood out was the chu-cumber. it was like you were drinking the most exquisite cup of tea mixed with the cool tones of cucumber, all while getting a little buzz on. \n\nmy taste buds are so happy that i gave sushi samba another shot. the best part was, management remembered that it was my cousin's birthday, and brought out a little slice of carrot cake with ice cream and sparklers crowning the top. it was definitely a birthday dinner that we will all remember.", 
            "omg, is it possible to be this good?  3 times there now and 3 times i have been equally impressed.  one thing that has been a constant on all 3 visits has been the great service i received.  our waiters always their menu's and made fantatsic recommendations.  this time i had the tempura greenbeans with a truffle oil dipping sauce (delicous!), berkshire pork gyoza and <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark> (at the recommend of our server)  everything was well prepared and efficiently served.  sushi samba is now a place that i can truly call home for great sushi.  as you can tell by my reviews, its safe to say that i am a fan.", 
            "i wasn't planning on going to sushisamba while in vegas, as we have a few in nyc and i never even bothered going to either of them. but we were wandering around the venetian/palazzo and we decided to go for it. what a pleasant suprise...everything was outstanding. there is nothing more fun than ordering a bunch of small plates and trying different things...which is why i love places like this and julian serrano...different cuisine...same concept. the aja sauce they give you for the lobster tacquitos is slam bang delicious, the seared kobe small plate was a-one, everything else was great also...<mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark>, <mark>Salt and Pepper Squid</mark>, oysters, foie/kobe roll with <mark><mark>Osetra Caviar Imperial 20g</mark> 20g</mark> gold leaf was actually the weakest dish...i got it just because of the novelty aspect really.", 
            "these 5 stars goes to the lady who was so damn good at her job by fulfilling every aspect of our dining experience that the food was more like a plus. i wish i got her name to credit her but we were a party of 8 girls staggering in late in high heels for our dear friend's bachelorette reserved dinner on a saturday night a week ago.\nwe got the run down quickly on doing their style of \"omakase\" after mentioning we had a show and had to finish by 9pm. we gave her free rein with a price per person between $30 to $40.\nnow, i was the only one who had been here before for the same concept so i was expecting the same good service and food. so i discreetly asked the lady server to make sure to add the miso <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> skewers. she happily replied, \"i gotchu girl!\" \nwe were then offered the extensive sake and wine menu, which we had to forgo. and one of the girls almost ordered the cucumber martini but didn't.  \nafter the time it took for a buzzed dude to walk over, show us his awesome swim trunks, (clearly forgetting to dress his bottoms to match his sharp shirt), wink and share a charming smile, and then leave...our appetizers were presented by a team of 3 servers.\n- otsumami: trio of edamame, tempura green beans with amazing truffle dip, grilled shishito pepper :)\n- pork gyozas (ok)\n- <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark> (wasn't as succulent or saucy but still good)\n\nour waters were always filled. thank you water guy!\n\nthen after enjoying our appz for about 20 mins, came out the yummiful skewers, 3 specialty rolls of sushi (could have asked for the <mark>El Topo</mark> roll but decided try the others) and an entree split by 2 plates to share. it was the teriyaki chicken with fried onions atop mashed purple potatoes. this is so yum because the chicken was juicy and flavorful!\n\nwe were having our fill and we were on schedule. then the lady server got us a surprise sake tree of their cucumber martini! also very refreshing and yum to end our meal.  we had to pack a bit of to-go and we were happy with the service. she lined our meal down the middle of our price range to about $36/person (plus tax+tip $45).\nso exceeded my last experience here!  i recommend the omakase style because the servers really do know the menu. trust!", 
            "my husband and i looked at an address wrong for a restaurant we were going to try.  long story short, we were at the wrong casino.  we decided to stay at palazzo.  we love the palazzo and have never had a bad experience here and figured we couldn't go wrong.  however, this is my least favorite dining expereince i've had to the venetian or palazzo.\n\nsushisamba was having their happy hour on friday 4-7.  we sat up at the bar and ordered off their happy hour menu.  we each decided to try the caipirinhas.  i'd equate this to a brazilian margarita.  i think the bartender said it has rum instead of tequila???  not positive though.  she hands the drinks to us and says something to the effect of \"this isn't my favorite drink, but it gets the job done\".  we didn't ask her if it was a good, bad or indifferent drink.  we just wanted to try something off their happy hour menu that we'd never tried before.  i thought it was a rather odd comment to make.  then when we tried it, we weren't crazy about it either.  if she was going to say something, she should've told us when we ordered.  regardless, the drink kind of grew on us.  didn't order a second and probably won't order the drink again, but it wasn't horrible.\n\nas far as food, we tried the chicken anticuchos, <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark> roll, salmon taquitos and yellowtail seviche.  chicken anticuchos were good....basically a chicken skewer with teriyaki.  <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark> roll was average.  salmon taquitos were kind of strange...if you do order these, make sure to put the spicy sauce on them.  without the sauce, they aren't very good.  last but not least, the dish i truly enjoyed was the yellowtail seviche.  the yellowtail was buttery and spicy all at the same time....very good.\n\nall said and done, our tab was just under $40 before tip.  not bad.  however, there was something about this place, i don't see myself ever coming back here.  other than the yellowtail, nothing was that good.  average to mediocre at best.", 
            "the kids meal is a great deal.  the adult menu is pricey and you will leave hungry unless you spend a lot of money.  we tried <mark>Purple Potato Mash</mark> (good), miso pork ramen $18 (for soup!), <mark>Berkshire Pork Belly</mark> (great if you savor the taste of fat), edamame and <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark>.  it was around 100 bucks - hubby left hungry", 
            "delicious drinks and food, and the bar tenders/servers rock! they have a happy hour that starts at 11pm, with the only catch being that you have to eat/drink at the bar. we preferred this as the music inside the restaurant was at night club volume. our order included <mark><mark>Jumbo Shrimp</mark></mark> seviche (amazing), the <mark>El Topo</mark> roll (it's so <mark>Uni</mark> they trademarked it), the <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark> roll, and shisito peppers. with our food and five drinks later (2 mojitos and 3 caipirinhas), our bill was $65. if you're staying at the palazzo or anywhere in vegas for that matter, it's definitely worth a visit.",

            "this restaurant caught my eye because it was something out of the ordinary from your typical sushi restaurant. the menu offered an intriguing variety but when i began reading the reviews i knew i had to try it. i would suggest anyone going there for the first time to try the dining experience because you may think you know what you want but the chef knows better! the server asks if there is anything you do not like or if you have any food allergies and then how much money per person you're looking to spend. there are options anywhere from $50 per person to $130 per person if kobe beef if something that interests you. as it was for a special occasion we opted for $80 per person and even though thats more than i have probably ever spent on a single meal there were no regrets.\n\ncourse #1 consisted of berkshire pork gyoza which is basically pork dumplings in a pumpkin puree and yellowtail ceviche taquitos, both of which were absolutely delicious and not necessarily something i would have ordered on my own.\n\ncourse #2 was yellowtail sashimi in a spicy peruvian sauce with a slice of red jalapeno on top and octopus sashimi in a japanese citrus sauce which again were both to die for!\n\ncourse #3 had an array of <mark>Filet Mignon</mark>, <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>, <mark>Alaskan King Crab</mark> and <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark>. all were moist and tender but the <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> absolutely melted in your mouth! <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark> was a yummy alternative to <mark><mark>Osetra Caviar Imperial 20g</mark> 20g</mark> as well.\n\nfinally, course #4 was the main sushi dinner. <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark> rolls were delicious, but the <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> with i believe tuna on top was absolutely amazing! there was also <mark>Half Maine Lobster</mark> and another roll which i believe had lobster in it as well and was probably the only thing of the entire dinner that i was not absolutely amazed with, but it was still good!\n\nanother great thing about this place is they tell you if there is anything throughout this meal you do not like they will take it back and bring you something else! as our server said, \"its like a money back guarantee!\"\n\nanyways this is definitely a place i would tell everyone who loves trying new things to try or even just the sushi lover. do it! it will not disappoint!\n\nonly part i would complain about is the fact that there is not one in california!!!",

            "i was sorry to give this place three stars! i really wanted to love it!  my husband and i just moved back from the east coast and we were really looking forward to some awesome west coast sushi! we arrived around 9pm and were promptly greeted and seated by the  hostess. we didn't like the original seat she tried to give us so i asked her to sit one table in and also because it was a four top instead of a two top (you need room when you order sushi.....you either get tons of little plates or a huge plate that doesn't fit on a two top table). well that must have frustrated her because she threw the menus down on the table i wanted and basically ran back to the hostess stand. ( yes she threw the menus!) we then proceeded to wait a good 15 minutes before anyone would come over and talk to us....not even give us water. finally our waitress came over and apologized and we were ready to order drinks and edamame. our drinks came quickly and we ordered the rest of our dinner with some suggestions from our waitress. our first to appetizers came pretty fast as well but the waitress for got we wanted edamame so that came later in the meal. the oysters were awesome...the yellowtail with jalape\\u00f1o was amazing.....sushi rolls were good but the <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark> was off....taste just wasn't there ( taste not spice.....it was basically no flavor but spicy). our waitress talked up the mini doughnuts for dessert so we ordered them...only to find out they were out.\nour bill was over 200$ and i left disappointed at that price.\non a side note the hostess tried to seat 3 other couples at the original table she wanted to give us and all 3 couple asked for different tables.....it wasn't a busy night.....she may want to take a step back and remember she is the first person people see....she needs to represent this restaurant better.", 
            "great fusion restaurant with a nice mix of small plates and interesting entrees. my favorite dish is the \"<mark>Moqueca Mista</mark>\" - a rice dish covered in a ton of seafood \"curry\". the flavor of the sauce is perfect and not overly sweet or coconut-flavored. \n\nwe also tried:\n1. crispy yellowtail taquitos - so good and perfectly crispy \n2. ceviche +tiradito combo of 4 - nothing special\n3. <mark>Berkshire Pork Belly</mark> robata - a little too sweet with the butterscotch miso \n4. <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> robata - also a bit too sweet\n5. salt + <mark>Salt and Pepper Squid</mark> - yum, this was fried with a lot of flavor\n6. <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark> - a bit too much mayo-sauce for my taste\n\noverall this was our second visit and if you order just the right things (i would stick with the fried appetizers and <mark>Moqueca Mista</mark>) then it's a great meal. it's pricey - but hey, it's vegas so i'm not really factoring that into my review. i would definitely go back again!",

            "my mother and i are came here last sunday for happy hour.  the sushi was absolutely delicious- fresh with decent portion sizes.  we particularly liked that they don't use a lot of rice  in lieu of other ingredients like many sushi restaurants. we tried several dishes from the happy hour menu at $6 each:\n\n<mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> roll - good not not too different from other <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> rolls we tried\n<mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark> roll - good portions of <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark> and not too greasy\nsalmon sushi - great flavor with asparagus.  this was my mother's favorite.\njapanese style <mark>Salt and Pepper Squid</mark> - a bit salty but quite tasty.  small portion.\nyellowtail seviche- two thinly sliced yellowtail with a tasty spicy sauce.  this was my favorite.\n\nin addition, we ordered the california roll which was $14.  however,  they used real crab instead of imitation crab.  it was quite tasty with generous amounts of crab used.  \n\nthe service was good.  the restaurant itself is dark with several televisions positioned around- they don't show sports just a program about sushi.  it would be even better if they had a television at the bar for sports.", 
            "oh. my. god. i want to eat here every day of my life, if only for the ishi yaki. my wallet is already throwing a fit about the thought of how quickly i would go broke, but akdsjhfakjldhf. words cannot describe how much i want to go back and eat all the things. well more specifically, all the ishi yaki.\n\nin reality though, sushisamba is unfor<mark>Tuna</mark> a sometimes food (unless you're a bajillionaire, in which case, dine on! i will live vicariously through you). it's just too expensive for me, as a student to afford. thank goodness someone else was picking up the check when i went.\n\nmy family and i had our christmas dinner here at like... 9pm (yea, we did christmas in vegas). it was by far, the fanciest christmas dinner i have ever had. \n\nwe were seated in the back room area since we had a relatively large party, but since it was so late, it was mostly empty there, which was simultaneously nice and eery. our waiter suggested we do the tasting menu, where he and the chef craft our meal for us, but since my mom had just been here with some colleagues the week before, we decided to just let her order for us, since she knew what was good. \n\n- <mark>Salt and Pepper Squid</mark>: the seasoning made this extra delicious-- a really good starter\n- crispy yellowtail taquitos: also yummy, though i may be biased because yellowtail is one of my favorite fish; very lime-y\n- <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark>: a twist on regular tempura, but absolutely delicious; if you don't like spicy mayo, maybe not your thing\n- ishi yaki: words cannot describe. <mark>Grade A5</mark>5 japanese waygu that you cook yourself on a hot japanese river stone? yes, please! you take a slice of meat, dip it in oil, and then put it on the hot stone to let it cook. there's a few different dipping sauces and three different types of salt that you can add to your meat. all of them are delicious, though i am partial to the black salt. there were some pears on the plate, so i was like what the heck, why not cook those on the stone too. still delicious. even thinking about this is making me crave it. the ishi yaki is really expensive, but if you're going to go for any of the japanese waygu options, go for this one because it is definitely the most <mark>Uni</mark>.\n- we ordered a bunch of sushi rolls, which were good, but not the most amazing ones i've ever had.\n- also, the lychee bubbletail is really good. the alcohol is not overpowering, it's not too sweet, and they put a real lychee (probably from a can) in it.\n\nrandom: i really like the music on their website... that probably sounds really weird, but it's true. love it.\n\ntl;dr: i know for a fact that the main reason why i love sushisamba as much as i do is because i was not paying. it was a crazy expensive meal, but it was delicious because we ordered some rather expensive (but good! oh so very good!) things. if you're not willing to splurge, you'll probably think i'm crazy for giving them a 5-star review, but if you are, be prepared to be amazed. just don't think about the check. and get the ishi taki. 5-stars for that alone.", 
            "wandered in here without a plan for a first time meet up.\n\nthough my eyes were not necessarily on the food, i noted a few things, sitting at a table vs. sitting at the sushi bar: the emphasis was on the fusion foods (sushi menu was backpage) and the drink menu was bigger than the food menu. i agree with bunny g. that no one bothered to explain anything about the menus.\n\nordered their house ice tea which is a mint tea arnold palmer, served with lemon & lime wedges.  very tasty & refreshing since i don't think i've ever had an arnie with mint tea.\n\nthe edamame was standard fare, served cool with crushed rock salt sprinkled on top.  i ordered 2 rolls, <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark> (6 pcs), and a <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> (8 pcs).  the <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark> was exactly that, no fuss, frills, standouts.  the <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark>, i think was just a tuna roll served with a squirt of sriracha.  good thing i wasn't there for the food!\n\nthe decor & service were exceptional and it looked like there was a special/private dining area in the back.  interesting decor that isn't particular of any single culture, or at least any that i know of.  there were these wooden chairs that looked to be carved out of giant coconuts but could really only seat an ommpa loompa.  another strange touch, that doesn't quite work to me: the food menus were not on the small side, but the cover was like leather, as in, not self supporting.  the only way to read the menu, that didn't feel awkward, was to lay it on the table.  for some reason, i didn't want a leather menu touching my little appetizer plate.  it seems unsanitary.\n\nbecause the prices were so high, i rate the food a 2-2.5 stars, but the decor & service a solid 4 stars.  so, 3.33 stars, it is!", 
            "i wanted to give this 4.5 stars, but i'll round down. came here with my sister for a convention in vegas, we walked around the venetian and pallazzo for a while until we finally decided on sushisamba.  first of all, the restaurant is beautiful. i really love the wall painings, interior design, and the bathroom design was really cool as well. service here was excellent, my water was always full, when i got up to use the restroom i placed my napkin on the table, when i came back it was neatly folded back for me. \n\nwe decided to get two appetizers. first the <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark>... really no point in ordering this. tempura taste the same everywhere, nothing special about theirs. we also tried the taquitos as suggested by the waitress. these were really just mini taco's. main lobster and yellowtail. both were nice and chilled taco's. good sauce on the side. not sure if i'd order them again, but they were decent.\n\nfor dinner my sister ordered their miso marinated chilean <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>. this was absolutely excellent. the fish was cooked perfectly, it was so soft and delicious. it's served with vegetables and those were pretty good too. possibly the post chilean <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> i've ever had. \n\nfor my dinner i decided to order two rolls, the <mark>Neo Tokyo</mark> and the bobo brazil. the <mark>Neo Tokyo</mark>, which is bigeye tuna and tempura flake was delicious. the little sauce on top was a nice spicy sauce. this roll was very delicious. as for the bobo brazil.... quite gross, too much avocado, wayyy too much in fact, in overpowered the entire roll. both regular avocado and some mushy avocado. in addition the red onion also gave it some very odd taste. this was one of the worst sushi rolls i have ever eaten.\n\nfor dessert we ordered the samba split for two. it was really good, and a decent sized portion. everything on the plate complemented each other and the banana brulee was fantastic.",

            "disappointing are the first words out as i depart the resturant.  i applaud them for the boldness but the flavor profiles just do not blend. \n\nhamachi sashimi - although the fish was fresh the pureed sauce and red jalape\\u00f1o   kill off any flavor of the fish. \n\n<mark>Salt and Pepper Squid</mark> - good concept but over cooked. the squid was stringy. \n\nshisho peppers  - not cooked well as the size of the peppers varied from very small to very large. no consistency in the bake so the small peppers were overcooked and the large peppers were still a bit undercooked. \n\n<mark>Sasa Handroll</mark> - a <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark> with quinoa in a soy wrapper. the quinoa was aldente so the texture of the quinoa overpowered the entire roll. also the shrimp was smothered in saracha mayo so you could not taste the shrimp. \n\nsushi -\n  saba - a bit fishy\n  hamachi - nice thick cut\n  kampachi - stringy and a bit slimy\n  ikura - fresh and clean \n  uni - fresh and clean",

            "we came to sushisamba for my birthday dinner a few days ago and i was blown away by the food! it definitely exceeded expectations.\n\nthe menu was so overwhelming we didn't know where to even begin and while our waiter didn't really help us narrow things down, he did make some good suggestions and helped us pace out the meal so we can order as we go. he came with the manager, who was very nice and gave us birthday shots, and also asked that we let him know if he could do anything. \n\nhere's what we started with: shishito peppers combo (grilled shishito peppers, tempura string beans with a truffle aioli, and edamame), <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark> in a spicy mayo sauce, <mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark>, and <mark>Crispy Hokkaido Scallop</mark> lettuce wraps. the peppers were a good surprise of the night because i didn't expect it to come with the string beans and edamame, but i definitely appreciated the greens in vegas! the <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark> was really tasty, but i wish it was a little crunchier when it came out. they tasted a bit soggy as if they were sitting in sauce for too long, but no complaints because the flavor was still there. the <mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> was good, but nothing really mind-blowing in my opinion. the <mark>Crispy Hokkaido Scallop</mark> lettuce wrap was phenomenal. our waiter said it was a new item on the menu and suggested we try it and it really blew us all out of the water. \n\nwe followed up the first round with the robata - we got the <mark>Berkshire Pork Belly</mark>, rib eye, <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>, and duck. all of them were so good, so make sure you pay a visit to the robata section when you visit! the duck and the rib eye to me stood out more than the others - they were cooked very well and had a good mix of <mark>Uni</mark> flavors.\n\nwe finished off dessert with their 4th of july special (red velvet cheesecake, frozen blueberries, and white chocolate ice cream) and sadly we were underwhelmed with what came out. i think we were so blown away by the entire meal, we felt like dessert was going to continue the streak, but were left wanting a bit more. either way, we were so stuffed it didn't matter and the dessert didn't take away from how much we liked the meal itself.\n\nwhat really set this over the edge is that the chef came out to shake our hands and chat with us really quickly, which i really appreciated! the service was great, the recommendations were on par, and the food was delicious. i would definitely recommend this spot for a special occasion - go ahead and gorge!!", 
            "i came for a bachelorette party last week on friday night around 11pm. my review is probably (ok definitely) biased because i was in such a bad mood at having to wait until 11pm to eat dinner. however, as you might imagine, 5 girls using one bathroom getting ready to go out in vegas is a production equal to cirque de solei that takes upward of 3 hours. but whatever we finally made it after a 15 minute, mile long cab ride down the strip from the cosmo to the palazzo hotel.  the restaurant was super dark (why don't they turn some lights on?) with huge tvs which were super loud. per the usual at many \"sceney\" type restaurants you could barely here the people across the table from you. \n\nwe got seated no problem as the restaurant was dead except for two or three big groups getting wasted in booths and a few lonely looking stragglers at the bar. our server was friendly but seemed to constantly be in a rush, although to go where i do not know. there seemed to be a ton of bus boys but very few wait staff. he could probably sense our frustration so he promptly brought out a wrought iron tree full of pink drinks. whether or not they had liquor was the only question (answer: not enough.) so we got a range of drinks, the best of which was a cucumber lime martini with vodka. after the night's beginning, i opted with straight vodka and diet coke.\n\nfor food we got a lot. some  memorable dishes were the <mark>Neo Tokyo</mark> roll with tuna which was solid, <mark>Heirloom Tomato Salad</mark> with sweet cilantro dressing, <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark>, <mark>Mushroom Tobanyaki</mark>, and sweet <mark>Coconut Rice</mark> side. my fave dish of all was the <mark>Heirloom Tomato Salad</mark> which was pricey but enough to share between 3 people. the rock shrimp was good but cliched, same as you would get anywhere else. the <mark>Mushroom Tobanyaki</mark> was interesting but not to my taste.  sadly we did not get dessert. \nin conclusion, i can definitely say i hope i will never be back with another bachelorette party, although i would not mind returning otherwise.", 
            "stopped here for happy hour. ordered the <mark>Seared W<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> Beef</mark> gyoza and the <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark> roll. reasonable pricing. the presentation of the food was impressive and it was all delicious.", 
            "i give <mark>Crispy Hokkaido Scallop</mark> 5 stars, rainbow hexagon roll 4.5 stars and 5stars for the sashimi. but we waited for the <mark>Berkshire Pork Belly</mark> ramen for at least 30 mins. while we were still eating the waitress placed our bill on our table. so rude!! stone <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark> tastes weird and is not the regular fluffy crispy tempura i've seen before. pricey. ewwwwwwwww i gave them a minimum of 15%tip. i wish i could give them 0 dollars tip.", 
            "it was fantastic!!  my girl and i went for dinner and drinks and had a blast.  everyone was beyond cool including our hostess and waitress.  our waitress was honest about everything and was not trying to get me to order a bunch of extra stuff.  we got the scallop small plate- amazing, <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark>- amazing, chilean <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> w/ <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark>- amazing fish and the corn was something new (not for me,) and the lima roll- very good!!!!  for drinks we has the pisco punch - yes please and 2 shots of some pink vodka goodness our waitress recommended.  everything was top notch.  the place is hip, trendy, what you want from a vegas dinner/pre-drink spot.  gals, including ourselves were decked out and fab!!  we made friends with the chicks next to us, was just so much fun.  the tables are close to one another, but we didn't mind at all.  \n\nto top the evening off, and these are the things that i remember, my eyelash was falling off (hahahaha!)  i couldn't get it back on and asked the hostess if she had any glue since i could see her huge gorgeous eyelashes were false as well.  she hooked me up!!  i was good to go!!!  \n\nthanks sushi samba!!  great evening!\n\nbtw- this place is $$$$ but we knew that going in.  \n\nloved it!!!!!!", 
            "since we were staying in the palazzo, i figured it would be easiest to dine in the hotel our first night in vegas. sushisamba sounded like a really interesting fusion of brazilian, peruvian, and japanese cuisine.\n\ninside i found a very lively, posh atmosphere. there was great music playing, giving it more of a club ambiance than that of a restaurant. i also liked the graffiti paint job on the walls. our waitress was tremendous, and the manager came to check on us periodically too. they definitely aren't lacking in the service department. all in all, this was a really enjoyable place to eat dinner.\n\nwe decided to go tapas style and order a bunch of different things to try. my dinner companion didn't have any preferences, so i ordered two small plates (<mark>Seared W<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> Beef</mark> <mark>Salt and Pepper Squid</mark>), two kinds of sashimi tiradito (kanpachi and tuna), and two samba rolls (<mark>Samba Strip</mark> roll and <mark>Sasa Handroll</mark>).\n\nour small plates came out first. i was excited to try the <mark>Seared W<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> Beef</mark>, which comes with a ponzu gelee, honshimeji mushrooms, and a truffled tofu crema. the meat was amazingly tender, and i liked the acidity of it all. even the mushrooms were very flavorful. the <mark>Salt and Pepper Squid</mark> was also very good. it comes with dry miso, shichimi, sea salt, crispy garlic, and smoked soy. this dish was definitely spicy. it was like calamari, but way better.\n\nnext up was the sashimi tiradito. the kanpachi (amberjack) comes with yuzu, sea salt, and black truffle oil. it was absolutely packed with flavor, and i enjoyed the saltiness of it. the tuna is served in a ceviche-style bath of granny smith apple, serrano peppers, and lime. it was beautifully sweet and spicy at the same time.\n\nwe were getting a little full, but we still had two samba rolls to go. the <mark>Samba Strip</mark> roll is a combination of <mark>Half Maine Lobster</mark>, mango, tomato, crispy rice, soy paper, and peanut curry. i absolutely loved the mango in there, which paired nicely with the peanut. the <mark>Sasa Handroll</mark> was very different from what you might expect sushi to be. it comes with <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark>, quinoa, shishito, cilantro, spicy mayonnaise, and red onion wrapped in some sort of cone. our waitress suggested we get two, since it's not very conducive to sharing. i agree. the sasa roll was a little difficult to eat, but well worth the effort. \n\ni didn't think we had waited very long for our dinner at all, but nonetheless the manager thought so, and to make up for it she brought over complimentary green tea sorbet pops for dessert. to put it mildly, they were amazing!\n\nsushisamba was absolutely top notch all the way around.", 
            "food was great!! we especially loved the <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark>. service was pretty quick. definitely a loud restaurant, so conversations are hard to hear. i'd recommend it to friends.", 
            "one of the many reasons i love the palazzo is the creepy-when-you-think-about-it facts that you can have a week long vacay and never really go outside. one of the other reasons i like the joint is... sushisamba. \n\nall fusion isn't created equal and most of what's deemed fusion in the multi-billion dollar tourist traps still doesn't cut it as top notch cuisine... but in three rotations over the years, the one thing i can say is that they've consistently delivered a good experience.  and that's more than i can say for a few others that are no longer at the palazzo.   it's also consistently noisy... do with that what you will. \n\nfavorites from the menu... <mark>Moqueca Mista</mark> (kinda hard to mess up fish stew with good ingredients ) and the <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> are my favorites of the full entries, which i wouldn't recommend on a first visit.  save big plates for your second or third go round.  almost anything with the w<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> is a hit; i think sushisamba drives the south american flavors home using fine japanese beef.  but if it works... \n\nthe yamato roll... epic as it is... to me, is **almost** overkill.  super indulgent <mark>Foie Gras</mark> and w<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> are almost a taste bud assault.   but at the same time, you have to try it-share it. the sa\\u00f5 paulo and the <mark>Neo Tokyo</mark> are my favorites here.   the <mark>Samba Strip</mark> is also pretty awesome.  again, pile enough good things together and see what happens. \n\nthe so so and not so on the menu... if anything ... rock shrimp (discontinued) and tiger <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark>.   mojitos are so so...( to me) as well.   the robata squid was literally hit and miss; had it once and it was great... and the next time... just rubber. \n\nall in all, come here with good company, a serious appetite and charge it to the room...i prefer early lunch or just after midnight.", 
            "the bartenders were friendly. the food was ok. i was expecting better flavor and quality for the price, but since i got to try things during their \"samba hour,\" it was worth it. we ordered from both the happy hour and regular menus and tried the amazonia, <mark>El Topo</mark>, <mark>Rainbow Dragon</mark>, and <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark> rolls, as well as the calamari and gyoza appetizers. the japanese-south american fusion is creative, but again, the quality is ok. my favorite of the bunch was the gyoza. 5 stars if you come during the samba hour because this place is a steal in vegas with the prices for the drinks and food. outside of samba hour, the quality doesn't justify the prices, so 3 stars overall.", 
            "i'm always a little skeptical of asian fusion cuisine, but this place does it right! our waitress was very helpful in guiding us through the menu, pointing out the more popular items. it is a \"tapas\" style menu, the plates are small and meant to be shared! we ordered: \n\n-<mark>Seared W<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> Beef</mark> gyoza: i think this was the best thing we ordered! the beef was soooo good and i loved the sauces on the side. \n\n-<mark>Berkshire Pork Belly</mark> ramen: everything in the ramen was very traditional, but the broth was very different from your typical bowl. it had a hint of lemongrass and some heat, which my boyfriend and i really liked (it kind of reminded us of tom yum soup). \n\n-<mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> and shrimp skewers: both came with a side of <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark>! so yummy! these are supposedly the two most popular of the anticuchos. \n\n-lima roll: a pretty standard <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark> roll. i would have rather tried another one of their small plates or tempura instead. \n\nbetween two people this was more than enough food. overall, a really great and satisfying meal with <mark>Uni</mark> flavors!", 
            "me and my wife came here for lunch and loved it. \nwe ordered green tea and was very good quality. \ni was reading other reviews and everyone mentioned the <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> skewers and <mark>Peruvian Corn</mark>. it was pretty good. <mark><mark>Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> was very yummy but i would prefer to have less sauce. the yellow tail tacos were also very good and fresh. my favourite was the <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark>. just the right mix of sauce batter and shrimp. we ordered the <mark>El Topo</mark> sushi to top things off and it was not bad but wish i had more room to try other stuff. will definitely recommend and will come back for sure.", 
            "we started our happy hour with several nina frescas and classic mojitos.  fresh strawberry pur\\u00e9e, vodka, orange liquor, and guava.  spectacular and they were only $6 each. next we sampled <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark> roll, <mark>Salt and Pepper Squid</mark>, w<mark>Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza</mark> goya, <mark>Rock <mark>Shrimp Tempura</mark></mark> roll, chicken anticuchos, and yellow tiradito sashimi. everything was amazingly prepared and all of our choices were perfectly flavored. we sat at the bar and brian explained the menu in detail, recommended drinks, and made sure our service was on point.  everyone at the restaurant was friendly and focused on customer service.  the music and atmosphere was hip and entertaining.  we will be back on our next vegas trip. you can also ask for jason; he will make sure that all of your detailed requests are handled."

            "i had such a delightful experience here. everything was amazing from the service to the food. \n\nservice:\ni got seated right away and got service right away. our waiter was amazing. he was oh so attentive and fast as hell with our order and everything else. there are plenty of people running around taking empty plates from your table and refilling your water...which is super important considering you're in las vegas and are probably dehydrated from the night before or from moments before. \ni asked where the restroom was and i was escorted there and once i got to the restroom there was an attendant that escorted me to the correct stall. \n\nfood:\nthe miso cilantro soup is da bomb. go ahead and try it would ya? \ni'm no sushi fan at all but my bf insisted on me trying his eel avocado roll and <mark>Salmon Avocado</mark> roll...holy crap...i like sushi!! these are probably the first sushi rolls i enjoyed. total yum-sicles and magical <mark>Uni</mark> to go along with it. \ni also had the fillet mignon which was flippin good. \n\nlong story short (too late), try this place. it's dope. i will be coming back when i'm in town.", 
            "sushisamba is always on my itinerary when i come out here for my annual birthday celebration/vacation. i came here two days ago after my wonderful massage, all excited, hungry, and ready to throw down on some food, so i was glad i made it just in time for the happy hour. to my surprise, service was kind of amiss: my order initially came out wrong, my caipirinha was off and had to be adjusted, the salmon in my <mark>Salmon Avocado</mark> roll was a little dark, and the mosquitoes flying around me and my food drove me nuts! the only saving grace was the <mark>Berkshire Pork Belly</mark> and the plantains, which were excellent (the mosquitoes thought so too).\n\ni really hope sushisamba isn't slacking off on what made them my fave in the first place :/ sushi don't fail me now...", 
            "so we just finished a late night meal here. i consider me and my fianc\\u00e9 to be sushi connoisseurs. we found it to be just 'meh. but than again, we have been blown away at other restaurants and after all this is a chain....\n\nanyway, we got here after 11pm and were seated. we specifically came here for the happy hour but were told after being seated, happy hour menu is at the bar only. you mean the 15 seat bar? we don't drink so i declined. not to forget, it's no where stated on the menu... our mediocre late night snack came to $70....\n\nshould stuck to my rule of only dining where the locals go. \n\n<mark>Salt and Pepper Squid</mark>- good. not overly fried. lime was nice touch.\n\n<mark>Samba Strip</mark>, <mark>Salmon Avocado</mark> and <mark>Spicy Tuna</mark>... nothing fancy and have had way better.", 
            "i thought this place was great! i had the <mark>Chicken Teriyaki-Samba Style</mark> and it was so good. super moist tender chicken on a bed of <mark>Purple Potato Mash</mark> potatoes. also had a <mark>Salmon Avocado</mark> roll and it was really good. service was fantastic"
