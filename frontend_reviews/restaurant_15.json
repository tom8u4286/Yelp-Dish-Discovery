            "cheesecake factory? is that you in there? if not for the big sign that says \"grand lux cafe\" then you'd never know the difference. the mashed <mark>Double Stuffed Potato <mark>Crispy Thai Shrimp & Chicken Spring Rolls</mark></mark> are still firmly engraved on my memory. i hope i get to go back one day just for this appetizer.\n\ni ate here at about 1am the night we arrived, and every morning for breakfast (buffet was comped by the hotel for us). never a bad meal. and our waiter actually told us that the company that owns them (and the cf) would actually be opening more grand luxes across the country, but i've yet to see one....", 
            "the floor is slippery, drunk girls on heels fall here all of the time.  \n\nmashed <mark>Double Stuffed Potato <mark>Crispy Thai Shrimp & Chicken Spring Rolls</mark></mark> are dense fat rolls however, the first two are very good.  my advice, order and share and wait to see people stuggle to keep their balance on the over waxed granite floor.", 
            "my roomate is a pastry chef here, so after a few visits i've decided to write a little review.\n\nwe went for her birthday with the oh so fabulous birthday gift certificate they give all employees and i bet they are regretting now cuz we went bananas!\n\nwe started with the biggest appetizer on the menu, the grand appetizer platter,  which featured a little bit of everything.  this appetizer is enough for 6 people, no joke.... spinach artichoke dip (tasty), crispy thai shrimp & chicken <mark>Double Stuffed Potato <mark>Crispy Thai Shrimp & Chicken Spring Rolls</mark></mark>( ok), duck potstickers(tasty), <mark>Buffalo <mark>Crispy Thai Shrimp & Chicken Spring Rolls</mark></mark>(not so tasty), cheese steak <mark>Double Stuffed Potato <mark>Crispy Thai Shrimp & Chicken Spring Rolls</mark></mark> (not so tasty) and vietnamese chicken summer rolls(the chicken was super dry and this is the 2nd time we've tried them).\n\nwe then shared the mongolian beef which was really good, served with pita bread and rice. why 2 starches? beats the heck out of me.\n\nthen the staff was so nice to let us go see jersey boys and come back after the show to enjoy the <mark>Fresh Strawberry Shortcake</mark>. i love strawberries, i really do. but there was nothing special about the shortcake. just typical, but still good.\n\nmy roomate will sometimes bring home other deserts which are way better. so way better they get to the point of craving status...warm banana chocolate chip <mark>Warm Sticky Bun Bread Pudding</mark> is my all time favorite and the roasted pineapple upside down cake is also very very good and they are all big enough to share. \n\non one of my visits i got the chicken, thinking it was like fried chicken (like a leg and a thigh), but it wasn't. it was under seasoned chicken strips. the batter is missing something chef. please handle that.\n\noverall i would go there again even if my roomie didn't work there.....", 
            "since everyone else mentioned it, i guess i will too......\n\ni went to the one at venetian....\n\nafter a night of drinking and partying up at tryst, we were all craving for some pho....yes....pho! and knowing there probably isnt a vietnamese restaurant open at 4am, we decided to come here becuz we knew they had a dish that was similar to pho. its called zen noodles. it was actually pretty good. although they didnt give us enough broth, more noodles and chicken which i thought was quite strange. and when we asked our server to give us more broth, she said she will see if anyone else ordered the same dish and if the chef has extras. i guess they dont just have a big pot of broth in the back ready for the next order. but luckily they did have more for us.\n\nwe also had the vietnamese <mark>Double Stuffed Potato <mark>Crispy Thai Shrimp & Chicken Spring Rolls</mark></mark> which were absolutely delish!!! and we totally killed the basket of warm sourdough bread they gave us too! the only gripe i have is that the bowl of noodle soup cost $13! oh well! i guess when youre drunk and hungry, you'll pay just about any amount to satisfy your cravings!", 
            "it's a cheesecake factory with the venetian decor.  plain and simple.\n\ni think the menu itself is being published as a novel in late 2008.  get ready to spend about a half hour looking over the menu if you read every item.  do not come here if you are indecisive; it could take you an entire day to decide.\n\ni tried the mashed baked <mark>Double Stuffed Potato <mark>Crispy Thai Shrimp & Chicken Spring Rolls</mark></mark> and they were fantastic, but the portion was large enough to split for 4.  my lunch-sized southwest salad was also delicious but a bit too large.  it makes me sad to think about how much food they must waste here each day.\n\ni didn't have any problems with the service being rude/incompitent.  if anything, our waitress was a bit too friendly; checking on us every 5-10 minutes.", 
            "what can i say?  beggers can't be choosers.. it was late..  we were hungry.. we came.. we ate... we left.. and wen't back to sleep.  where else would i go at 5 in the morning after shakin' my bootie at tryst all night?  \n\nit was a bit of a trek, as we had to navigate our way through the lovely canals of venice, with the gondolas idly sitting in the waters, as if to remind us what time it was.  and, it was a little surreal... i was headed to breakfast and the sun was coming up when i really should have been going to sleep. but, then again, this is vegas, the city that never sleeps.  \n\nthe menu was nice.. the service was okay..  we had the mashed baked <mark>Double Stuffed Potato <mark>Crispy Thai Shrimp & Chicken Spring Rolls</mark></mark>.. yummy...i had a <mark>Santa Barbara <mark>Spicy Buffalo <mark>Spicy Flat Bread Chicken Sandwich</mark></mark></mark> with a side salad that was entirely forgettable ..  i ate my friends french fries- i give them 4 stars for the ranch dressing, though.", 
            "i'm not  a fan of chain restaurants -the food is always mediocre and the service is never good but i liked this place. we were recently in vegas with six friends and couldn't decide where to have dinner. a friend suggested the grand lux cafe....   the restaurant is located inside the palazzo at the venetian hotel.  it's very casual-- has the feel of an upscale diner with booth seating and fluorescent lighting. the menu is several pages long and includes everything from thai <mark>Double Stuffed Potato <mark>Crispy Thai Shrimp & Chicken Spring Rolls</mark></mark>, pizza, burgers and fries, all day breakfast, chinese noodles, etc. normally these places scare me because they try to do everything but end up doing nothing well.  this place was an exception.  we all enjoyed what we ordered, the service was attentive and the food was solid. order the vegetarian chop salad with peas, lentils, beets, asparagus and cheese. very fresh and filling. note the portions are huge so you might want to share with a friend!", 
            "we made reservations for 12 people and they were really cool about it when it ended up being 10. the food is hit or miss and similar to the cheesecake factory menu but not an exact match, although they do serve a select variety of cheesecake factory cheesecakes. \n\nmy comments on the dishes i tasted:\n\n-the clam chowder was total fail. not only was it lukewarm, it was devoid of any flavor, clam or otherwise, and just tasted like watered down cream. \n-vietnamese fried <mark>Double Stuffed Potato <mark>Crispy Thai Shrimp & Chicken Spring Rolls</mark></mark> were pretty good\n-<mark>Chicken Lettuce Wraps</mark> came with a huge bowl of filling. we had to ask for more iceberg lettuce because we ran out 1/4 of the way through the bowl. the flavor was decent although on the salty side.\n\ni like that they're open 24 hours, but for a late night meal, nothing beats noodle asia!

            "its a 3.5 rating for me. very close to 4; \n\nryan and i were having a mini vacation out in vegas december 14-17th; my friends always come to vegas (my best friend is dating someone from out there) and i had only been to vegas once in my entire life for a little less than a day. \n\ni decided that since i've stepped into this town without the faintest idea of what i'm doing, i'll holler at my friends who are no strangers. they suggested grand lux; i had never heard of this place before even though its a chain and i didn't even know it was part of the cheesecake factory family until i yelped it (like the good yelper i am, i referred to my iphone app to spy on this place before diving in)* and was relieved to find that it got pretty good reviews. \n\nwe ate here twice. first time was yum nummy.\n\nlunch: \n--<mark>Buffalo <mark>Crispy Thai Shrimp & Chicken Spring Rolls</mark></mark> holy cow good; \n--ryan's enchilada lunch special was very good\n--my <mark>Chili-lime Chicken And Mango Salad</mark>/house salad/chicken and mushroom soup was.. a little bland, it was okaaay, but it needed something. finished my salad the vinaigrette was good. \n\nthey have some pretty good lunch deals which are huge servings even for lunch. the <mark>Buffalo <mark>Crispy Thai Shrimp & Chicken Spring Rolls</mark></mark> were soo good, i crave them all the time. \n\ndinner (the next day) \n--ryan got crispy caramel chicken with rice which was pretty good although we were a bit apprehensive about the caramel part. \n\n++now here's where they lose points++\n--i got the flat bread spicy <mark>Santa Barbara <mark>Spicy Buffalo <mark>Spicy Flat Bread Chicken Sandwich</mark></mark></mark> which was horrible! bland bland; flat bread was tough and tasted like cardboard, chicken was bland and tasted like subway \"roasted chicken\" the spicy mayo was gross and the fries were way too crunchy & cold. i was so disappointed. \n\n--good thing i was able to get a little full from the <mark>Buffalo <mark>Crispy Thai Shrimp & Chicken Spring Rolls</mark></mark> we ordered again. \n\n\nit seemed like i got the short straw here.. my food was never that great, but ryan's was waaay better. almost like a different place. put i do give it points for having some good things on the menu, but i have to take some away for being kind of inconsistent. \n\n\nso i struggle with the stars here. i wouldn't kick glc out of bed though. i'll come back here again because for two 21 year old struggling college students, the prices weren't bad at all. i'll come back. but i just wish the place was consistent. \n\n\n**yelp actually saved me from a lot of places out in vegas. you could be a big name four star restaurant, but if yelp gives you bad reviews i'm taking its word for it. i love yelp.",

            "when staying at the venetian- the grand lux cafe is a lifesaver! \n\ni just recently stayed at the venetian with 7 other girls for a bachelorette weekend and grand lux came in handy on several occasions. we had several other meals planned out, but between staying at pool parties too late and needing disco naps before heading out for the nighttime, we didn't make most of our dinner plans...so this place was the answer! we would call in the order, go down in our robes (quite the site, lol), pick up the food, take the food back up, and feast in our rooms :) we had everything from pizzas, to <mark>Double Stuffed Potato <mark>Crispy Thai Shrimp & Chicken Spring Rolls</mark></mark>, to salads, and everything was great. the best part was the price...for 8 girls to eat, the total was only $96! that's less than lunch cost us the first day at one of the panini cafeterias across from the grand lux...if only we knew! \n\nwe also used the grand lux for breakfast one day as we surprised the bachelorette with a lingerie party brunch in the room...we had the waffles, scrambled eggs, hash browns, bacon, and fruit salad (along with some bottles of bubbly and oj we picked up from different places around the hotel...afterall, what's a brunch without mimosas?!) and we all loved every breakfast item we had. \n\nsome of the girls also used this spot as a late night (ok fine, early morning) spot to snack before hitting the sack, but i didn't...i was more concerned with keeping my liquid diet going ;)", 
            "i've been to the one at the beverly center as well as the one in vegas.  basically, it's a cheesecake factory with a different name.  they have the same d\\u00e9cor and the same overwhelming menu with chefs that do nothing spectacular but do a little bit of everything mediocre.  \n\nsame story with my latest visit.  i had the pasta carbonara and the sauce was good, a bit bland and the pasta was a bit overcooked.  however, the bf loved the fried <mark>Double Stuffed Potato <mark>Crispy Thai Shrimp & Chicken Spring Rolls</mark></mark> that you roll in lettuce.  kinda a hybrid between egg rolls and <mark>Chicken Lettuce Wraps</mark>.  i have to admit, it was good.\n\nweird part.  i made a friend at my table.  there was a little ant crawling around.  he wanted some of my pasta and since i didn't finish it myself, i gave him some.  sadly, he drowned in the oil.  \n\nanyway, on to desserts.  their desserts give them a one up on cheesecake.  i love their <mark>Fresh Strawberry Shortcake</mark> along with their beignets.",

(i'm not imparting the secret, you'll just have to go ask the restaurant yourselves).\n\nwe tried the aforementioned mashed potatoes <mark>Double Stuffed Potato <mark>Crispy Thai Shrimp & Chicken Spring Rolls</mark></mark>, their flautas, and an order of their prime rib sloppy joes.\n\neverything was delicious!  i was all rejuvenated and ready to go back out there and gamble some more!\n\ncons:  so many choices, such a small stomach.  i couldn't have thought of anything wrong with the meal.\n\nbottom line: next time i go back to vegas and am craving a midnight meal, i'll so go back to the grand lux!",

            "yes, grand lux is a chain, but with food and libations like this, who cares?!?  \n\nwe started with cocktails.  the carmel apple martini is killer.  now that they no longer offer their white cosmo, this one is my favorite.  two of my dining companions had bloody marys that were made just right -- spicy but not too.  one had a frozen margarita that was well made and not overly sweet.\n\nwe stuck with appetizers on this trip, and the best of all were the crab cakes.  no doubt the best i've had with lumps of crab in a well seasoned mixture lightly grilled.  \n\nwe ordered the appetizer combo and enjoyed the following:\n\nvietnames <mark>Double Stuffed Potato <mark>Crispy Thai Shrimp & Chicken Spring Rolls</mark></mark> with chicken and fresh cut veggies in a steamed, cold wrap served with peanut sauce or spicy sweet and sour sauce.  philli cheese steak <mark>Double Stuffed Potato <mark>Crispy Thai Shrimp & Chicken Spring Rolls</mark></mark> with diced steak and cheese in an eggroll wrappper fried and served with chipotle mayonaise.  also eggroll style was the buffalo chicken served with the absolute best bleu cheese dressing i've ever had.  my husband's favorite were the steamed duck dumplings.  the spinach artichoke dip was creamy with plenty of artichoke. \n\nfor dessert i had to revert to my all time favorite creme brulee duo - one vanilla and one chocolate.  best ever!\n\nit was 11:30 on a weekday.  seating was immediate and service was outstanding.", 
            "love the one in los angeles and love this one too. our waiter went out of his way to complete what i ordered which was not on the menu. seared ahi tuni steak in a lemon butter sauce. it was amazing and made perfectly. we brought some new friends with us and they loved it too. never disappoints. love the <mark>Buffalo <mark>Crispy Thai Shrimp & Chicken Spring Rolls</mark></mark>, <mark>Double Stuffed Potato <mark>Crispy Thai Shrimp & Chicken Spring Rolls</mark></mark>. crispy ahi rolls and the grand lux melt burger :) its all sooooo good !! pick this location not the palazzo location",

(or you could just drink through the hangover...but that's usually for vacation, and its tough being a local!)\n\none star deducted cause the wait staff isn't quite the friendliest, but then again i guess i probably wouldn't be all smiles if i was dealing with drunken vacationers all night long.  despite that it is still always worth a trip after a night at tao nightclub!",

            "i have eaten at this restaurant several times. i always loved it because of the variety of food they offer. i went twice last week. first time by myself and sat at the bar. the bartender was clearly only focused on his serving of the waiters and didn't care much about the folks at the bar eating a meal. so service wasn't great. i had the <mark>Roasted Beet And Goat Cheese Salad</mark>. if was very good but too big...wish they had smaller side salads to offer. i had the garlic and shrimp pasta as my main dish. it was fine.\n\na couple of nights later i went in with my friend for dinner. that time we had a fabulous server who was top notch. i wish i could remember her name as she was really right on point. we had the asian nachos for an appetizer. i had dreams about them they were so good. we also had some <mark>Double Stuffed Potato <mark>Crispy Thai Shrimp & Chicken Spring Rolls</mark></mark> and they were good as well. for dinner i had spaghetti again. i ended up being so full that i through it away when i got back to the room. never did eat it. i did have a bite or two and it was typical pomodoro. my friend had an  asian bowl of soup. it was huge and looked delicious. she enjoyed it very much as well.\n\nthis is a wonderful go to restaurant. it is moderately priced compared to some of the other options and the food choices are amazing. and quality of food is very good! i am a fan of the grand lux restaurants.",

            "for years, the grand lux was the best 24 hour coffee shop in vegas in my opinion.  i don't know if that's true now, places like central at caesars are certainly giving it a run for its money, as casinos are investing more thought and money into these 24 hour joints.  but, grand lux is certainly an excellent place to eat any time of day, and you'd be hard pressed to find better food in the middle of the night.\n\nthe menu is expansive, which is not surprising given that it's owned by the cheesecake factory folks.  most sandwiches are a good bet in my experience; the club is a favorite of more than one visitor i've taken to grand lux.  the fries are good, but they are rarely seasoned.  the buffalo chicken <mark>Double Stuffed Potato <mark>Crispy Thai Shrimp & Chicken Spring Rolls</mark></mark> are a favorite of mine, whenever we get appetizers they get my vote.  they are made like traditional <mark>Double Stuffed Potato <mark>Crispy Thai Shrimp & Chicken Spring Rolls</mark></mark>, but with the buffalo and blue cheese flavor wing fans will like.  the grand lux burger melt is another menu item i've ordered more than once.  served on grilled parmesan bread, it's a play on a patty melt.  certainly not appropriate if you're looking for a light meal, but it's a great burger.\n\nmore than once, i've had the breakfast buffet in the morning.  it's very simple:  pastries, fruits, eggs, breakfast meats, potatoes, etc.  but, it's all fresh and hot, and they make omelets or hash browns to order.  i prefer my hash browns extra crispy, so they made some and brought it to the table.  since venetian doesn't have a buffet, this is a nice option in the morning.\n\nfinally, i love the strawberry lemonade, but it's too sweet.  i get it without the sugar lining the rim, and that does the trick for me.\n\nservice can be spotty during peak hours, but i've never had any major issues.",

(i rarely go out for breakfast, but for this place i'll make an exception; so many places seem compromised at breakfast, like everything is being done by the b team, which i suspect it probably is.) at lunch, i had the chicken enchiladas (available in two portion sizes -- the lunch consists of two smallish enchiladas, plenty of food unless you are really hungry). the sauces were spicy and flavorful -- a nice dish and only about $11. hubby had the appetizer-portion <mark>Greek Salad</mark>, also good, and quite substantial. we had a side of fries, and they were good. \n\nthe staff made sure our water glasses were filled, not making us feel rushed, and the time we spent there was exactly right (they keep the music up *really* loud to keep those tables turned... but in a nice way). compared to the iffy service and cramped quarters at the tintoretto bakery / cafe near the grand canal shops, this place is a godsend.",

            "most people know that the one chain restaurant  i am typical fan of is the cheesecake factory. little did we know that this restaurant (and it's sister at the palazzo, is in the same family as cf). we ended up here several time during our stay due to various reasons.\nour first night here, we ended up having dinner due to the lateness of our check-in and simply being starving. we had a great waiter, and though the restaurant may be a sister to the cf, the menu is mostly different. the bread here is delicious and very crusty and basically a vehicle for butter. great crust-and great butter. i ordred the <mark>Four Cheese</mark> pizza and added mushrooms and asked for the pizza to be cooked \"well done\".the husband ordered the chicken pot pie. when our meals arrived, the pot pie was in a giant bowl, covered with crust and my pizza was served roman style (oblong not round) and was more chewy then i like. a few bites in, kevin and i switched dishes. he loved the pizza as it was very flavorful, but texturally more to his liking. the pot pie had one of the most delicious crusts i have ever had, but the innards were kind of bland and boring. i had a crust and chicken dinner. we were too full for dessert.\n\nthe second time we came here was for dessert after the jersey boys where we learned that the dessert menu differs from the same restaurant in the palazzo and our group was disappointed because we dined at the grand lux for dinner(at the p)and had our hearts set on certain desserts that weren't offered here. we did manage to order the <mark>Fresh Strawberry Shortcake</mark> (yummy) the <mark>Key Lime Pie</mark> (good but afterwards a bit too tongue tart and the banana pudding with home made vanilla wafers. the wafers were the best part of this dessert, but the pudding itself was cloyingly sweet and our waitress wasn't too excited for our table of 6 only ordering dessert and water.\n\nour third and last time at this location was for lunch with 2 of my girlfriends from high school who flew in on my birthday day. they were starving and chose to come here since they were also staying at the venetian. we came down a bit after they had been there and had already ordered.  i had the miso salmon (a staple order for me at the regular cf) and it was much better here than what i have had at any cf with more vegetables, no butter sauce and a little kick. kevin had the lunch  size pepperoni pizza <mark>Chili-lime Chicken And Mango Salad</mark> and the pizza was actually small enough to fit on the same plate as the salad. i had a bit, it was too greasy for me, but that is because of the pepperoni. my friends' had a cuban and a carnitas sandwich both served with fries and they both loved what they ordered. \n\nof course the meal was served with the good vehicle for butter and yes, i had my fill.\n\nthis place is open 24 hours, with a late night menu, a breakfast menu a lunch time menu and the regular menu. if this was a place close to me, i would be a regular and not have shame since it was good.", 
            "just reviewed the cheesecake factory so it seemed only natural to also review the grand lux cafe' while i'm at it tonight. went to the one in houston several times and fell in love with it (except the high-ceilinged bus station design and corresponding noise level), so was glad to find they opened one in the venetian...and then opened one in palazzo next door soon after. kind of weird to have the only two glc's in vegas so close to one another, but they don't seem to suffer for customers, so that's a good sign. i'm reviewing the venetian one because we've been there more, but both locations are equally good.\n\ni agree with the majority of the reviewers here- the menu is huge and caters to every taste (even vegetarians - and vegans - three items, i think), the portions are large and the specialty drinks are quite good. my favorite items are the chicken piccata, wiener schnitzel and thai chicken pizza...even when here for brunch, actually. a couple of items are similar to the cheesecake factory (southwestern salad, asian <mark>Chili-lime Chicken And Mango Salad</mark>, jambalaya, chicken parmesan) but are presented in a more upscale manner and larger portion size. what is definitely different from the cheesecake factory is the dessert tray- the beignets, <mark>Peach Cobbler</mark>, <mark>Warm Sticky Bun Bread Pudding</mark>, various decadent chocolate delights and fruit tarts are definitely tempting, but five types of cheesecake are also served here for \"traditionalists...\"\n\nas a vegas local, i'm always on alert on the strip for the all-too-common management vibe that says \"we cater to tourists- and can cut corners because we know most won't be back no matter how good the service is.\" we come back here so often (both locations, but primarily the venetian) because never has waitstaff ever seemed like they were anything but glad to serve. sometimes there can be a backlog of orders and/or customers and things get delayed, but our server has always come over to apologize, give updates and the occasional extra bread basket, etc. \n\nfour stars rather than five because the prices for some items are indeed higher than other comparable restaurants on and off the strip, and the wait can sometimes be 30-40 minutes...sometimes at times you'd expect (weekend evenings and fridays) and other times you might not (a tuesday evening in december, a monday morning in july...) but if the wait at this location is too long any given day, it's a 10-minute walk to the other one in the palazzo where the wait might be shorter...and vice versa.",

            "the only delicious affordable casual choice we located on the strip. bonus! it is open 24/7!!!\n\nwe had some delicious soup sandwiches <mark>Chili-lime Chicken And Mango Salad</mark> here for lunch. i was impressed with the food quality. the atmosphere was nice - like a cheesecake factory. it is a great place to eat when you want something really delicious and don't feel like dressing up. we tried out several of the other cafe type places at aria and mandalay bay and this was the nicest, most affordable and had the best food of the bunch. \n\nwe also came back another time for desert. i had the creme br\\u00fbl\\u00e9e which was two deserts in one- chocolate creme br\\u00fbl\\u00e9e and the traditional type. it was delish and would be a great desert for two. my sweetheart had godiva cheesecake and proclaimed it as good as cheesecake factory... minus the godiva truffle they decorate theirs with. \n\nthe rars will be back.", 
            "minus one star for the service. overall, great food. i ordered the asian <mark>Chili-lime Chicken And Mango Salad</mark>. it was tasty and full of flavor. the chicken was a bit dry though. the service on the other hand was not the best. when my friend and i were seated, there was another group who came in 5 minutes after us. they were served first which which was wrong. my friend and i were sitting there for 15-20 minutes, nobody served us.", 
            "as many other reviewers have stated, this place bears a strong resemblance to cheesecake factory and is owned by the same company. i don't think the food here is quite as good though, but it does have the benefit of being open 24/7 so it was exactly what my party was looking for when we rolled in at 2 am in the morning. the late menu is a bit limited (two pages only). i got the <mark>Chili-lime Chicken And Mango Salad</mark> which was sort of missing the chili-lime flavor part, but they substituted the romaine lettuce for spinach at no extra cost which was nice. i also wish there were more actual bits of chicken in my salad (they were so tiny and hard to find you almost had to squint at the dish to identify them.) i also tried my friend's crispy fried wontons which had great asian inspired flavors but were soo salty. personally i think the cheesecake factory is better. great service though, they brought out a cute little desert for my friend who's birthday it was.",

            "most people know that the one chain restaurant  i am typical fan of is the cheesecake factory. little did we know that this restaurant (and it's sister at the palazzo, is in the same family as cf). we ended up here several time during our stay due to various reasons.\nour first night here, we ended up having dinner due to the lateness of our check-in and simply being starving. we had a great waiter, and though the restaurant may be a sister to the cf, the menu is mostly different. the bread here is delicious and very crusty and basically a vehicle for butter. great crust-and great butter. i ordred the <mark>Four Cheese</mark> pizza and added mushrooms and asked for the pizza to be cooked \"well done\".the husband ordered the chicken pot pie. when our meals arrived, the pot pie was in a giant bowl, covered with crust and my pizza was served roman style (oblong not round) and was more chewy then i like. a few bites in, kevin and i switched dishes. he loved the pizza as it was very flavorful, but texturally more to his liking. the pot pie had one of the most delicious crusts i have ever had, but the innards were kind of bland and boring. i had a crust and chicken dinner. we were too full for dessert.\n\nthe second time we came here was for dessert after the jersey boys where we learned that the dessert menu differs from the same restaurant in the palazzo and our group was disappointed because we dined at the grand lux for dinner(at the p)and had our hearts set on certain desserts that weren't offered here. we did manage to order the <mark>Fresh Strawberry Shortcake</mark> (yummy) the <mark>Key Lime Pie</mark> (good but afterwards a bit too tongue tart and the banana pudding with home made vanilla wafers. the wafers were the best part of this dessert, but the pudding itself was cloyingly sweet and our waitress wasn't too excited for our table of 6 only ordering dessert and water.\n\nour third and last time at this location was for lunch with 2 of my girlfriends from high school who flew in on my birthday day. they were starving and chose to come here since they were also staying at the venetian. we came down a bit after they had been there and had already ordered.  i had the miso salmon (a staple order for me at the regular cf) and it was much better here than what i have had at any cf with more vegetables, no butter sauce and a little kick. kevin had the lunch  size pepperoni pizza <mark>Chili-lime Chicken And Mango Salad</mark> and the pizza was actually small enough to fit on the same plate as the salad. i had a bit, it was too greasy for me, but that is because of the pepperoni. my friends' had a cuban and a carnitas sandwich both served with fries and they both loved what they ordered. \n\nof course the meal was served with the good vehicle for butter and yes, i had my fill.\n\nthis place is open 24 hours, with a late night menu, a breakfast menu a lunch time menu and the regular menu. if this was a place close to me, i would be a regular and not have shame since it was good.", 
            "came here for lunch with a few co-workers.  it took our group of 5 to get organized before we got seated. we got seated in short order.  i wanted to order a half <mark>Four Cheese</mark> and half sausage, pepperoni and mushroom rustic pizza.  the server didn't know if they would do this.   i said if thet didn't i would order the rustic pizza with <mark>Sausage, Pepperoni And Mushrooms</mark>.  i wanted too take half the cheese pizza home for the kids.  service so far was good. they brought our drinks pretty quickly. later the server said that they couldn't make the pizza half cheese and meats/mush  the other half because the bases are different.  they brought out some bread to munch on. the bread was very very good. we asked for more bread-the server never brought any more. \n\nit seemed to take as while to get the food but don't remember how long it too. \n\na co-worker ordered the <mark>Four Cheese</mark> pizza so we i gave him four pieces of my pizza and he gave me four pieces of his pizza so i could take it home for my kids.   the meats/mush pizza wad good but very salty.  my co-worker said the cheese was not nearly as salty.  maybe it was from the pepperoni and sausage.  my water was filled once when i was halfway early on during our visit but not once afterwards. others had water and iced teas, but it wasn't filled either. \n\ncouldn't make half cheese half meat/mush pizza, super salty pizza, no refill for drinks after getting our food, and no requested bread makes for a subpar rating."

Chicken</mark> pizza and a caesar salad. the pizza was really good and satisfying. the salad was fresh and the dressing was tasty. my friends had ate some lunch from the cafe about 30 mins earlier, when my boyfriend and i arrived at the suite we were luckily to have some of their calamari. the calamari is to die for!! it comes with an array of dipping sauces and in the mix of calamari - there are some pieces of zucchini. after bites and bites of calamari, it's refreshing to take a bite of the soft zucchini. it helps balances the taste of the calamari. especially with fried foods, after a handful i'm usually sick of the greasy taste in my mouth. the calamari at grand lux is fried perfectly and keeps you wanting more. the portions of the food is pretty good too. \n\n     on my next vegas trip, venetian and grand lux are definitely on my hit list.",

Chicken</mark> pizza & house salad: another lunch special with ginormous portions\n~ creme brulee duo: two huge creme brulees (vanilla and chocolate)...still liked good ol' vanilla better.\n\nwe had so much food leftover...we ended up eating it for dinner.\n\nour server was really friendly and helpful.  definitely would come back next time we go to vegas.",

Chicken</mark> flatbread second...equally dynamite. \n\nthe creme de la creme was the chicken & waffles. perfectly cooked chicken, a thick belgian, chopped pecans, a maple butter sauce makes for a plate full of awesome! this was so great that the redneck next to us actually stopped talking on his cell phone to comment how wonderful it looked. i was actually full halfway through, but i just couldn't stop eating it. could. not. stop! \n\ni loved this place and am really looking forward to having it again very soon!",

(the breakfast selections become limited after 11am but they still exist.)  the salads are huge as are the omelettes <mark>Roast Turkey And Brie Sandwich</mark>.  the bread that they have for the table- wheat and sourdough are the ones i've tried- are also very good.  there is almost always a line but it moves pretty quickly and the service is good.",

            "food is okay. breakfast wasn't very good (which is very disappointing when you are hung over) but their salads <mark>Roast Turkey And Brie Sandwich</mark> were decent. can't really complain too much since it is open 24 hours but its not super special.",

            "i love brie. that's a fact, jack. so when i quickly glanced at the menu, my eyes were set on the turkey & <mark>Roast Turkey And Brie Sandwich</mark>. turkey, brie, cranberry-apricot chutney, & arugula made up of this sandwich. the one thing that irked me was the overdose of mayo. the side salad was also overdressed. the waiter was super spacey, and couldn't remember anything we said. he also forgot to charge us for drinks, so that was good for us.", 
            "grand lux has always been my go-to spot whenever i'm around the vicinity. whether i'm staying at venetian, or even a little bit further out like at ti or encore, i always make that extra walk to eat here.\n\ni really enjoy dining here for a quick meal. it's opened late, they have a big variety of different foods, and the service is always on point. the restaurant is quite big inside though it doesn't look that way outside of the front. it's great bc i never had to wait for a ta\n\ni think i come here at least one or two lunches when i want to eat something decently good. their salads <mark>Roast Turkey And Brie Sandwich</mark> are perfect for lunch. also, i always find myself here when i'm hungry at odd hour like 10-11pm at night.\n\ni really enjoy eating at grand lux. i honestly think you can't go wrong with dining here. they have something for everyone. their menu is quite extensive so even the pickiest eater can find something they like at grand lux. i highly recommend their sandwiches for lunch and pastas or big plates like their meatloaf for dinner or even 4th meal. lol. you can't go wrong dining here at grand lux!!"

            "not so \"lux\" (2.5 - i'm not a fan of commercial chains and it definitely wasn't my choice to come here). value wise, it sux's because it's in vegas. it's pricey for what it is which isn't much. if it was in suburban hoboken this would be a happening spot. i can just picture some jersey chicks chain smok'n and downing the best eva' <mark>Spicy Flat Bread Chicken Sandwich</mark>... oh my gawd.", 
            "fabulous!\n\ni needed an order for take away and fast. not only did they whip up a <mark>Santa Barbara <mark>Spicy Buffalo <mark>Spicy Flat Bread Chicken Sandwich</mark></mark></mark> and my <mark>Roasted Beet And Goat Cheese Salad</mark> super quick, but the manager even made me a special fruit cup with strawberries and pineapple chunks, because i don't really care for the mixed fruit cups with grapes and melon.\n\ni appreciate the \"custom\" customer service experience, the efficiency, and the quality of my meal.\n\nthis place gets a ton of traffic, being in a casino, but they really went the extra mile for me.\n\nalthough i did not try them, the desserts looked impeccable! they have a  beautiful lemon meringue tart that is about 7\" high!", 
            "i can't believe i haven't reviewed this place.  i really like this place.  portions are massive.  the food is good.  the place is beautiful & clean.  the chicken pot pie is delicious.  their <mark>Santa Barbara <mark>Spicy Buffalo <mark>Spicy Flat Bread Chicken Sandwich</mark></mark></mark> are also nicely done (pick any one of them and you won't be disappointed).  the fried chicken strips are also fantastic; they're not overly fried and they're perfectly tender.", 
            "i liked the service and ambience from the start..they bring out sourdough and butter which is great. i ordered a texas tea to drink. good amount of alcohol and still tastes refreshing. i ordered the spicy buffalo <mark>Santa Barbara <mark>Spicy Buffalo <mark>Spicy Flat Bread Chicken Sandwich</mark></mark></mark>. both the fries <mark>Roast Turkey And Brie Sandwich</mark> were great..", 
            "thank youuuuu venetian for hitting up mr. overton, founder of the cheesecake factory.  i wonder how many meetings it took to concoct the greatness we know as grand lux cafe.  i make it a point to stop by whenever i come out to sin city.  in fact, we ate here two nights in a row during the last trip.  just doesn't get old!  so convenient after a night out if you're staying at the venetian.  the location is right next to the guest room elevators.  you can't just pass by grand lux and not eat on the way back to your room.  that's preposterous!  \n\ncome here to satisfy your drunken munchies, soak up that alcohol with their complimentary bread n buttah, or even order a few more drinks.  i don't know about you guys, but i need something crunchy and guilt-ridden when i got the drunk munchies.  the crispy flautas from the appetizer menu is a blessing from above.  just check out my picture (http://media4.px.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/uoo08o3zagdwmet_-m-chg/l).  with the avocado sauce it comes with, this lil snack can be enjoyed intoxicated or not.  so good.  if it doesn't tickle your fancy..there's still so much to choose from the late hour menu.  it's not as extensive as the daytime menu but you still got your breakfast plates, sandwiches, salad, pasta, etc.\n\nduring normal hours, i absolutely must have my spicy flat bread <mark>Santa Barbara <mark>Spicy Buffalo <mark>Spicy Flat Bread Chicken Sandwich</mark></mark></mark>.  grilled chicken, pepperjack, and all the usual fixings on a pita-like bread split into 4 quarters.  its corn salsa is the perfect topping.  they lay on a little bit of the chipotle mayo sauce, but i always ask for more for the side of fries it comes with.  you guys really gotta order this at least once.  it's a pretty large amount of food -- i always gotta half it with someone.\n\nservice is always great & i've never had to wait over 5 minutes for a table, but i may have been lucky each and every time.  wish i had the same kind of luck at the adjacent slots and black jack tables. hmph..", 
            "designed just like the cheesecake factory! i had the <mark>Grand Club Sandwich</mark> which was reallyy good & the boyfriend got the buffalo <mark>Santa Barbara <mark>Spicy Buffalo <mark>Spicy Flat Bread Chicken Sandwich</mark></mark></mark>, even better than my meal! also great service!", 
            "love this place! i ordered the fish last time and it was pretty good. i've been here a few times and ordered the pasta the time before and that was pretty good also! lunch special deals are pretty good and definitely filling. i hear the <mark>Santa Barbara <mark>Spicy Buffalo <mark>Spicy Flat Bread Chicken Sandwich</mark></mark></mark> is really good.", 
            "my new absolute favorite chicken wings. in all certainty.\n\nslightly crispy, piping hot, yet with a spicy/sour/sweet/sticky sauce over the top that is absolutely great.\n\nalso tried the <mark>Santa Barbara <mark>Spicy Buffalo <mark>Spicy Flat Bread Chicken Sandwich</mark></mark></mark> and bbq bacon burger -- everything was delicious.\n\nfavorite late night food spot in vegas fo shoooo!", 
            "sooooo i've never been here and had just went and picked up the old man from work. it was almost 1am so he suggested here, i shoulda been against it (since his picks always suck) but was like ok! so we get there and theres hella ppl! i was thinking to myself, this place has to be yummy!\n\nboy o boy, i opened the menu and was like \"wtf!\" ok, lemme tell you... i'm a cheap date! i think its absurd to spend more than 10$ on a meal! even though my bf was paying i was just irritated. i really wanted a <mark>Grand Club Sandwich</mark> and seen one listed.. for 12$!!!! i scanned the menu and seen that everything was pretty much 12$+ and also everything they had on the \"late night\" menu didnt sound yummy. so i got the club.\n\nwe both got it and it came to our table... ok, when i think of a club i think of a double decker sandwich... not a plain 2 pieces of <mark>Spicy Flat Bread Chicken Sandwich</mark>! this thing was 2 pieces of bread, arugula, turkey, and bacon. uhmmmm lame! the fries were good, but i wasnt pleased with my sandwich. i left irritated and will probably not go back!! the server was nice, and the place itself is very beautiful, but like i said i'm a cheap bastard. i didnt think the quality of the food was worth it.", 
            "crisanto was the best waiter i have ever had in my life! i would come back simply for him! he was more than helpful and superb at his job! it is owned by cheesecake factory so i was already expecting great tasting food! but oh my goodness was the food good! my boyfriend and i got the fried calamari for an appetizer which was soooooo good! huge portions too! i ordered a <mark>Santa Barbara <mark>Spicy Buffalo <mark>Spicy Flat Bread Chicken Sandwich</mark></mark></mark> and my beau ordered the modern cuban sandwich! both tasted heavenly! modern cuban is a must! overall i would come back here before anywhere, and if crisanto is my waiter! :)", 
            "maybe i was hungry but i liked the food we had here.  when we got there they were going to seat us inside the main dining hall but i asked if we could sit in their patio area and they cleared out a table and sat us there.  it was saturday night and the people watching (primarily girls in tight, tight, saran wrap dresses pulling down their dress every 5th step) was fun. we shared a mixed deep fried calamari, shrimp, onion plate which was quite large and very good.  i had a <mark>Santa Barbara <mark>Spicy Buffalo <mark>Spicy Flat Bread Chicken Sandwich</mark></mark></mark> with avocado, bacon, and cheese which was one of the better <mark>Santa Barbara <mark>Spicy Buffalo <mark>Spicy Flat Bread Chicken Sandwich</mark></mark></mark> i've had.  plus the fries were crisp, salty enough and just plain great.  the waitress was pleasant and took a dish off our bill when we realized we had over-ordered.  very nice of her.  i just thought this place was really good and would go back for a simple bite any day.", 
            "i love this place! located in the venetian is a fancy pretty restaurant always crackin' with ppl. surprisingly its not expensive, $10 can get you a fat portion of food that can last you 2 meals if you wanted to. its similar to the cheesecake factory but its in veeeeeegass and its open late nights for all the hungry drunkies! there's so much on the menu we didn't know where to start. last year i had the cobb salad (wonderful fat salad) this year i went for the buffalo <mark>Santa Barbara <mark>Spicy Buffalo <mark>Spicy Flat Bread Chicken Sandwich</mark></mark></mark>. it was okay, wasn't spicy enough. my bf had jimbalaya and it was hella good. my friend really enjoyed his pastrami sandwich, finished all of it before we did. \n\nas for dranks, i had the patron paloma. it was so good i could barely taste the alcohol. my sandwich+drink was probably $25, pretty pricey for a meal but i had leftovers of sandwich and fries for later (which were never touched and left at cosmo hotel room garbage). hehe.\n\nservice was excellent, our waitress was funny, we tipped her well.", 
            "i have to admit, i am impressed with the grand lux cafe.  when you're in the venetian and looking for a place to eat, you got high-end, food court, and their grand lux cafe.  just from the gold decor, attentive well-dressed attentive servers, and the ambiance, you'll start thinking this is a pricey restaurant to eat at.  nope...the grand lux cafe is very affordable and the prices for their cafe/grill food mimics a local denny's or ihop.  but that's the just the prices that mimics these chain branded restaurants.  food quality, presentation, service, and selection is all top notch here at the grand lux cafe.  in other words, you cannot go wrong here.\n\ngrand lux cafe serves everything from breakfast to high quality meals like filet mignon.  such a huge selection, i had to ask the waiter to give us extra time to decide.  in the meantime, we got our bread served and it was killed in minutes. for dinner, we shared the calamari which is also served with fried vegetables and fried shrimp.  i don't eat vegetables, but there's something about fried vegetables that makes it go down better.  the calamari was delicious, lightly breaded, and wasn't rubbery.  yes..i've had overly chewy and rubbery calamari, but not here.  cristina p. had a salad and i got the crispy <mark>Santa Barbara <mark>Spicy Buffalo <mark>Spicy Flat Bread Chicken Sandwich</mark></mark></mark> with a bowl of soup.  let me add that there isn't a crispy <mark>Santa Barbara <mark>Spicy Buffalo <mark>Spicy Flat Bread Chicken Sandwich</mark></mark></mark> on the menu, but all you have to do is ask and sometimes you shall receive.  my <mark>Santa Barbara <mark>Spicy Buffalo <mark>Spicy Flat Bread Chicken Sandwich</mark></mark></mark> was exactly how i expected it to taste...chicken breast that's golden fried, crunchy, tasty, and perfectly sandwiched in a hamburger type bun. \n\nin all, i have to say that the grand lux cafe is an easy stop if you're hungry, undecided, and in the venetian.  there's plenty for everyone here and the price is better than most.", 
            "i heard about grand lux cafe through a few friends, and i am very surprised i have never heard of it before (considering there is a huge location right in chicago that i passed by yesterday). but anyway, i decided to check it out as our last lunch/meal in vegas before we had to board the shuttle. it was a saturday afternoon, and the rush of people on the streets was insane, so it took us a good 20 minutes or so to get to the venetian. i love that hotel so much - so gorgeous, but we didn't have any time to explore, so we rushed over to the grand lux (very easy to find) and got seated right away. it's a very big restaurant, with plenty of seating and a very \"grand\" and beautiful interior, but it was packed! \n\nwith the little time that we had left, my boyfriend and i rushed through the menu and he ended up getting the <mark>Buffalo <mark>Crispy Thai Shrimp & Chicken Spring Rolls</mark></mark> and i got the spicy flat bread <mark>Santa Barbara <mark>Spicy Buffalo <mark>Spicy Flat Bread Chicken Sandwich</mark></mark></mark> - very good! my only concern was that the food took forever, so we literally had 10 minutes to eat and we had to go right away. the doggy bag came into good use when our plane was delayed for 5 hours... \n\nanyway, this place reminds me so much of cheesecake factory, but that makes a lot of sense considering it's the same owners. with that being said, the menu is endless, so i will def be making my way back here next time i am in vegas. i love the fact that it is 24/7, and i wish i knew that when i was there fri night around 4 am when we were starving and everything around cosmo had closed. \n\nservice was good, but like i said, the food took way too long. i'd recommend this location and though it's a chain, the prices are very reasonable and there is def something on the menu for everyone.", 
            "this is basically a 24-hour cheesecake factory, but better, by virtue of it being in the venetian.\n\nwe kicked off our vegas trip here, after arriving around 11. definitely started the trip off right with some surprisingly tasty cocktails - the pineapple smash was so awesomely summer, and the shoot the moon beer cocktail was really great as well. \n\nfor food, the waiter accidentally brought me the spicy buffalo <mark>Santa Barbara <mark>Spicy Buffalo <mark>Spicy Flat Bread Chicken Sandwich</mark></mark></mark>, instead of the spicy flat bread <mark>Santa Barbara <mark>Spicy Buffalo <mark>Spicy Flat Bread Chicken Sandwich</mark></mark></mark> i ordered. but it's okay, because he apologized profusely and gave us a complimentary dessert at the end. the buffalo chicken sando itself was spicy and friend and huge and perfect, and i am certainly glad about his mistake. i also tried my friend's kobe burger and it was really, really tasty. one note, though: don't come here when you're counting calories.\n\nfor (free!) dessert, the waiter brought out a warm butter cake, which was, frankly, the best. it tasted sort of like a waffle not in a waffley shape, and the ice cream and strawberries just really completed it.\n\noverall, definitely an choice place for some late night dining, if you can excuse having deja vu of your local cheesecake factory.", 
            "this place is delicious and i look forward to my next visit.  vegas is always hot and humid, so venturing for food becomes quite a hassle and chore.  luckily there are great places like grand lux cafe that will spare you some time.  there is one inside the pallazo and another inside the venetian.  \n\nthe first time i came to grand lux i had one of their <mark>Santa Barbara <mark>Spicy Buffalo <mark>Spicy Flat Bread Chicken Sandwich</mark></mark></mark> with fries, about $13.  its fairly big and pacts quite a punch.  i was stuffed for hours and even had to nap shortly after.  this last time i tried the burger melt, about $13.50, which also comes with fries.    the burger melt oozed from side to side with hot melted cheese and thousand island.  every bite tasted just, if not better, than the last.  i highly recommend the burger melt if you're interested in a burger.  i got mine medium rare and it was delicious. \n\nservice was pretty fast and efficient.  this will have to be a must for me next time i'm in vegas", 
            "during our recent trip to vegas, we got a chance to check out the grand lux cafe in the venetian. there was a 30 min wait or so and it was pretty impressive, considering the restaurant is so big. \n\ni had the buffalo <mark>Santa Barbara <mark>Spicy Buffalo <mark>Spicy Flat Bread Chicken Sandwich</mark></mark></mark>, which was the best i have ever had. our waiter was a great guy and he was kind enough to bring me extra buffalo sauce. we left satisfied.", 
            "we ate here daily during our week long stay at the venetian. every thing we are was great, (except for the pancakes-too thick for my liking, but tasty nonetheless) we never tried the buffet for breakfast because the huevos rancheros and chilaquiles were spicy good. delicious waffles and lightly breaded chicken.\ngreat salads at lunch and the crispy <mark>Spicy Buffalo <mark>Spicy Flat Bread Chicken Sandwich</mark></mark> looked great as well as the fish and chips. \ndinner was so flavorful. we tried the chicken revello and it was fantastic. very good cocktails here, as well. you cannot go wrong with your dining here. and the prices are relatively reasonable compared to some of the other restaurants in the venetian, especially at dinner time. \neat here! you won't be sorry.", 
            "back in the day when i lived in vegas this was the go-to late night dining spot. their late night menu has plenty of variety and everything is always good. now whenever i'm in town i usually find myself there. staff is consistently good. this visit, the kitchen even made my favorite flatbread <mark>Santa Barbara <mark>Spicy Buffalo <mark>Spicy Flat Bread Chicken Sandwich</mark></mark></mark> even though it wasn't included on the late night menu. ranch is amazing. my husband had the chicken and waffles and says it was the best he'd ever tasted and a friend's corned beef hash was delicious! thank you for feeding my belly on hungry vegas nights!", 
            "i visit grand lux at the venetian frequently and have never been disappointed.  the options are many, including pasta, salads, main entr\\u00e9es and desserts.  if you have been to cheesecake factory, you will understand this is a similar menu.\n\nthe servers have always been very attentive from initial order, to drink refills and checkout.  \n\ni've tried a variety of the meals here.  the crispy caramel chicken is outstanding with a bit of sweetness to go with a little kick.  the steamed rice accompanies nicely.  the buffalo <mark>Santa Barbara <mark>Spicy Buffalo <mark>Spicy Flat Bread Chicken Sandwich</mark></mark></mark>, the club, chicken and waffles, and several salads are a big hit as well.\n\none tip: order a dozen cookies when you first sit down and they are delivered to your table warm when you get ready to leave.  excellent!\n\ngrand lux is a great option for groups or if you want a nice variety to choose from.  definitely recommend!", 
            "this is my new usual spot. we came here twice to eat for the two days we were in vegas! the first time i ordered the buffalo <mark>Santa Barbara <mark>Spicy Buffalo <mark>Spicy Flat Bread Chicken Sandwich</mark></mark></mark> and fries. i did have to send the fries back because they were just a little warm and my fries have to be hot!! the service was a little slow but the servers were nicer do offered bread while we waited! yummy!!!! i also got the spicy thai chicken with veggies and white rice. i would definitely order this again but with light sauce. they use all white chicken breast for their chicken plates. my husband always gets the chipotle burger and he is one happy camper. they are addy with the cheesecake factory so the prices are about the same but way better food!!!", 
            "okay, so the 4 stars really reflects that you can get just about type of food you want at a reasonable price right in the hotel.  the menu is very big, and some of the dishes are 3 stars, but some are 4.  the burgers are great, the big salads are very good. avoid the italian food and i wouldn't order the steak. but if you want a cobb salad, a burger, <mark>Santa Barbara <mark>Spicy Buffalo <mark>Spicy Flat Bread Chicken Sandwich</mark></mark></mark> this is a good place to grab one for 15-20 out the door with a drink.", 
            "this place was pretty good. it was ideally located since we were staying at the palazzo so getting there wasn't a struggle. i ordered the <mark>Santa Barbara <mark>Spicy Buffalo <mark>Spicy Flat Bread Chicken Sandwich</mark></mark></mark> and it was pretty good. the service was also pretty good. definitely recommend this place."

            "if this place were down the street from me, in california somewhere, i'd give it an extra star.  the food's not bad.  \n\nbut it ain't great.\nand it definitely doesn't live up to my vegas standards.  and add to that the fact that it is inside my favorite hotel, the venetian, where i constantly state that the food is amazing - - grand lux is the only establishment in that hotel that pales in comparison.\n\nit's a coffeeshop atmosphere - extremely large with plenty of seating.  in all of my years of going to the venetian, i've only stood in line twice or so.... usually, there is seating available.\n\nthere is a lot on the menu, so much that it is difficult to pick.  the basic things - like a bagel with lox and cream cheese - is fine.  but how hard is a bagel and cream cheese?\nother things - like the <mark>Grand Club Sandwich</mark> or the steak sandwich, or the burgers, are all mediocre.  huge, yes, but it is a 12 dollar burger so i expect either big in taste of huge, and grand lux gives you huge.\n\ni keep on eating here on every visit in spite of the lack of taste, just because it's so convenient  since i stay at this hotel, and the mood is inviting and nice but i am consistently unimpressed with the food.  it's vegas.  impress me.... and i give them all these chances, and still - -  they don't.\n\ncoffee is blaaah - as is the case with the entire hotel, and service is decent.  nothin' to write home about.  for quick and easy eating - - grand lux cafe is okay.  but your socks won't be knocked off, you won't come out moaning and groaning, you won't wonder when the next time you get to eat here will be, and it's definitely not one of those, \"i cannot wait to get home to yelp about this place\" type of restaurant.\n\ni uploaded some of the food photos i took here.\nbelieve me.  it looks better than it tastes.  :-)", 
            "grand lux cafe... \n     thank you grand lux cafe or i would have not survived vegas for a week. my boyfriend and i stayed at the venetian on our new year's vegas trip. i ate here at least 3 times; the first time was at 3 am on our arrival night. i ordered a <mark>Grand Club Sandwich</mark>, which was pretty good on an empty stomach from my 5.5 hrs drive from la to vegas. i ordered the sandwich from the bakery because the line was long for the restaurant itself due to club goers. i was disappointed when the guy at the register told me that the wait time will be 40 mins. 40 mins for a sandwich! he was lucky i was hungry! \n\n     a few days later i grabbed some lunch from the bakery, i had ordered a <mark>B.b.q. Chicken</mark> pizza and a caesar salad. the pizza was really good and satisfying. the salad was fresh and the dressing was tasty. my friends had ate some lunch from the cafe about 30 mins earlier, when my boyfriend and i arrived at the suite we were luckily to have some of their calamari. the calamari is to die for!! it comes with an array of dipping sauces and in the mix of calamari - there are some pieces of zucchini. after bites and bites of calamari, it's refreshing to take a bite of the soft zucchini. it helps balances the taste of the calamari. especially with fried foods, after a handful i'm usually sick of the greasy taste in my mouth. the calamari at grand lux is fried perfectly and keeps you wanting more. the portions of the food is pretty good too. \n\n     on my next vegas trip, venetian and grand lux are definitely on my hit list.",

            "if you love cheesecake factory, then you will love this joint.  why?  because they are owned by the same company and are essentially the same restaurant.\n\nafter hearing rave reviews of this place, i knew it was worth trying.  after eating there would i head back?  since there are so many other restaurants to chose from in the venetian, probably not.\n\ngot there at 6:00pm on a friday night and were sat immediately.  there were three of us.  they brought out bread and butter right away, but really lacked as it took more than 15 minutes to come back and ask for our drink orders.\n\nthe menu selection is massive with all types of food.\n\nwe ordered:\n*edamame: soybeans in their pods stir fried with spicy szechuan sauce\n-i've never had edamame this way before and it was probably my favorite thing of the night, besides the sourdough bread.\n\n*asian <mark>Chili-lime Chicken And Mango Salad</mark>: sliced chicken breast, crisp wontons, rice noodles, lettuce, napa cabbage, green onion and roasted almonds. tossed in our asian dressing\n-completely flavorless.  the end.\n\n*seafood salad: lump crab, shrimp, avocado, tomato, corn, green beans, egg, celery and green onion over a bed of crisp romaine tossed with our \"louis\" dressing\n-i didn't try this one, but the person said it was really good.  very generous with the seafood!\n\nfor dessert:\n*butterscotch caramel pudding: rich, creamy butterscotch pudding topped with whipped cream, house-made caramel nut popcorn and a chocolate chip pecan cookie\n-to me, the pudding was thick like custard.  it was delicious!\n\n*<mark>Key Lime Pie</mark>: baked fresh with a graham-pecan crust. topped with fresh whipped cream\n-delicious!\n\n*white chocolate raspberry truffle cheesecake\\u00ae\n-same cheesecake that is served at the cheesecake factory.  i mean, can you really go wrong?  nope!\n\ni will say that it was really nice to sit and chat with friends without being rushed.  we got there at 6:00pm and left at 9:00pm.  now the service was very slow, but at the same time, if we weren't chatting and eating slow, we probably would have gotten out of there at 7:00pm.\n\neveryone was nice and had no problem splitting the bill 3 ways.", 
            "4 stars for food, plus 1 star for great service!\n\nlocated in the venetian hotel, this is a good spot to try some quick american-influence entrees. i've been here a couple of times with a party of four or greater - of course here on business. it's pretty relaxing considering how crowded it can be. during my visit, the wait staff was very attentive, kept our water filled at all times. and kept on bringing warm bread. \n\none thing i found interesting is how they broadcast their recent health and safety inspection - a wall dedicated to letter a's. it's actually quite nice. \n\n\nfood was pretty good considering the cost, and i must say, wait times on food is exceptional considering the crowd. during a tradeshow evening, this place was jammed packed - and we got our food in about 15 minutes. very quick considering the crowd. \n\ni had the spaghetti with clams and shrimp. good portions of food - although, i would've preferred less clams and shrimp. it seemed a bit much. \n\ni also tried the <mark>Key Lime Pie</mark> - it was much larger than i expected - so, consider that a warning for those who have a desire with dessert. \n\nif your crew isn't sure of what to eat, then bring them here - a relaxing atmosphere, where there something for everyone to eat.", 
            "came here on a tuesday evening, after the average \"dinner rush,\" though being vegas, places are busy all the time. some people have mentioned a large line and little wait time, we found both the line and wait time nonexistent. the lady who escorted us to our seat was pleasant, asking me how my day was doing. i found the personalized attention refreshing. once seated, our server could not have been better. she gave us the perfect amount of time to go through the menu before we were ready to order, and continually checked up on us and refilled our drinks without us asking. our food came out in a timely fashion, and all was cooked to perfection- fish and burgers alike. as for dessert, we ordered a cheesecake, a cupcake creation, and a slice of <mark>Key Lime Pie</mark>. the <mark>Key Lime Pie</mark> was flavored perfectly-not too much and not too bland. the cheesecake was rich but tasty, and the cupcake dish was devoured in minutes.\n\nall in all, an affordable and delicious choice for dinner. you can easily dress up or come casual- matters not. the lighting could be romantic if you wanted, or comfortable with friends. i plan to make this a traditional stop when i am here in vegas and strolling the venetian."
