            "what an experience! it's comparable to having dinner @ pier 39 in san francisco watching the sea lions lay there motionless. yes. it's that epic.\n\nthe ambiance, decor, and 360 panoramic view is breathtaking. they should make their patrons pay just entering this place. but of course, those breathtaking feature do make an appearance on your bill listed next to your food items. \n\nservice:\n\nthis is where the very annoying, yet true saying applies, \"you get what you pay for.\" there were at least 3 servers waiting on our table of 12, which felt really nice. the servers were very pleasant and willing to do whatever it takes to satisfy our visit. i was really appreciative of each and everyone of them. \n\nbread was served to each person individually while you choose you dinner items and enjoy your cocktails. i was surprised at how long it took before our server took our order, but once we placed our orders, the wine arrived and 15 minutes later all the appetizers, then 20+ minutes later the first course, 30+ minutes later the main course, and 1 hour+ after the desert. it was relatively nice to have that cushion to digest and tipsy chat.  i was definitely not use to the time and the leisure of having the time cushion, but considering the view, it was well worth it!\n\nfood:\n\nquality wise, everything was amazingly fresh. from the <mark>Grand Seafood Platter, Lobster, Shrimp, Crab, Oysters, Clams</mark>, lobsters, shrimp and quality cut meats, it was well worth the $$$$. our party ordered about 5 appetizers, all of which tasted good.\n\n i ordered the surf and turf entree which is a <mark>Prime Aged New York Steak</mark> with a crab cake. i was surprised at how simple it tasted. don't get me wrong, the food was good, but it just wasn't fantastic or outstanding. if i were to grade it, the food tasted b average while the quality was an outstanding a.\n\nafter sobering up, i would really wished the chef  got creative with flavors and tastes. using crazy herbs and spices to blend the perfect $$$$ taste, which is what we paid. over 1800. the eiffel tower restaurant is still remarkable experience i recommend."

            "we came here with opentable reservations and they didn't follow through with the seat views request that was made with the opentable reservation. on top of waiting for an additional 20 minutes for normal tables (even though we made advance reservations), we didn't even get a view. they said we'd have to wait an even longer for a table with a view if we wanted a view that badly. since we were already hungry, we decided not to wait any longer.\n\nour order:\n\nmarket greens ($18), black cod ($44), loup de mer ($48), and pistachio souffle ($16). \n\nloved the taste of the market greens - <mark>Market Greens, Avocado, Sunflower Seeds, Sherry Walnut Vinaigrette</mark>. it sounds normal, but the taste was perfect! very well balanced!! the crispy loup de mer was also fabulous! it included spinach leaves, peanut potatoes, bacon and <mark>Crispy Loup de Mer, Spinach Leaves, Peanut Potatoes, Bacon, Red Wine Lobster Jus</mark> that was quite delicious! \n\na favorite that all can agree on: pistachio souffl\\u00e9!! i'm typically not a big dessert person, but wow...the pistachio souffl\\u00e9 is mouth watering goodness!! and as a pistachio lover, whoa! perfect taste!! i was surprised i could taste the wonderful pistachio flavor and of course the souffl\\u00e9 was cooked to perfection! \n\noverall service was okay. our server answered any questions we had but didn't think to ask if we had any preferences. maybe he was too busy? \n\nlet's just say, thank goodness the food and of course the famous pistachio souffl\\u00e9 was perfect! if not...this would have been a terrible experience with one star. i am giving it only 3 stars because i may not come back again for the price that didn't correlate with the lack of service given. \n\nwhen i'm giving a rating, it isn't solely based on the food, it's based on various aspects of the restaurant (service, timing, etc.). so, for $$$$ establishment, i expected better. since it wasn't as great as expected from such a pricey establishment, i cannot give it the stars to match it's price tag. \n\nif you need an example of a wonderful restaurant, check out my other reviews of a wonderful spot in vegas that is $$$$ :d\n\nd\\u00e9sol\\u00e9!"

            "this place basically met and exceeded all our expectations making this a very special dining experience for both of us. i have been lucky enough to go to the real paris, france a few times and have had some very fine french food while there so of course i was prepared to label this the vegas version, good enough for the tourist only. i was so wrong. they had a huge staff of chefs working the kitchen which you see as soon as you step off the elevator. the head chef jean joho certainly knows what he is doing. the appetizer of warm fois gras with crumbled bacon which i spread on a baguette was super rich and addictive. we also tried the seared scallop appetizer which were two of the best tasting giant scallops i have ever had with a sort of pesto flavored couscous on them. they were awesome. for entrees we had a house specialty which was a <mark>Heirloom Tomato, California Burrata, Balsamic Aspic, Basil, Extra Virgin Olive Oil</mark> poached halibut which was absolutely the best fish i have ever had in my life. i personally had the seared rare duck which was also brilliant. desserts were a caramel souffle that they began baking for us 40 minutes before we finished dinner so it was piping hot at the perfect time along with a fantastic creme brulee. we had a table facing the strip and the bellagio fountains and while the sun slowly set and all the lights came up, made for an incredible view during dinner. this place will cost you, no doubt. but if you appreciate french food and want a super special view and experience, i would recommend it highly.", 
            "ever since i was a little girl and my family would travel to vegas for my dad's work, i wanted to go up the eiffel tower at the paris hotel. well, i finally got to do that during a work trip of my own and i got to eat at the restaurant. that was definitely one of the highlights of my trip because the food was exquisite (almost said \"amazing\" but i wanted to try a classier word to match with this classy place ;) )!\n\ni made reservations through open table and was advised on their strict dress code. luckily i brought a dress, otherwise my jeans or shorts wouldn't have cut it. so fyi, be prepared for that. as soon as we stepped foot in the elevator to take us up, i was already impressed by the service. our waiter was so attentive and seated us by the windows so we could get a good view of the bellagio water show. he also made sure to get our food out quickly because we had to be out of there to make it to a show. \n\ni started with a glass of riesling and the blue cheese souffl\\u00e9 pudding with petite salad. it had a little eiffel tower picture on it, which meant it was a favorite...and not only can i see why, but i'm still thinking about how delicious that dish was! the souffle was perfect, not too stiff and not too soft (sorry, that's the best i can do to describe it!). the flavor was not too intense even though blue cheese usually is, so that made it even better!\n\nfor my entree, i had <mark>Heirloom Tomato, California Burrata, Balsamic Aspic, Basil, Extra Virgin Olive Oil</mark> poached halibut and herbed couscous with tomato basil. fish is usually not something i order, but i wanted something light and this was highly recommended. wowww. that's all i can say. try it. you'll love it. both the fish and the couscous were seasoned just right and i felt like every bite just melted in my mouth. \n\nthe portions weren't huge...i mean, it's a fancy restaurant so i was expecting tiny! but they were just right. i would have tried a dessert, but we had to go. i'll do that next time i go back!", 
            "so if you're gonna do the whole \"vegas experience,\" you may want to include the eiffel tower restaurant as part of it. \n\nmy company held a dinner here in their private room. one pet peeve of the room is the huge column that divides the space, which can create awkward ducking or hitting your head. the private room does not have a great view of the bellagio fountains, but does have a nice view overall. \n\nthere is a minimum you need to spend to reserve the room, not sure of the price, but price per person (sans vin) came to about $100 each, not including tax, tip and all those other extras that can get tacked on. \n\nthe prix fixe meal started with:\n\n* blue cheese souffl\\u00e9 pudding w/ walnut, pecan, petite salade - interesting. kind of like boursin meets jello. about the size of a small ramekin, it went well with a baguette. great salad! \n\n* tuscan kale salad w/ door county dried cherries, quinoa croutons, toasted pecans - okay, so technically one could call this gluten free! and the kale salad was a nice counterbalance to provide all the antioxidants one needs when in vegas. why do we have to know the cherries are from door county? i don't know. where is door county? again, i don't know. very fresh salad, the tang of the cherries provided just the right \"bite.\"\n\n* saut\\u00e9ed wild salmon w/ quinoa summer beans, tomato, first pressed <mark>Heirloom Tomato, California Burrata, Balsamic Aspic, Basil, Extra Virgin Olive Oil</mark> - this is what i'm talkin' bout! perfectly done, beautifully prepared salmon that melted in your mouth. wild salmon can sometimes have a more \"meatier\" taste that farm-raised due to the lower fat content, but this was spectacular.\n\n* eiffel tower classic cr\\u00e8me br\\u00fbl\\u00e9e - la pi\\u00e8ce de r\\u00e9sistance! very large serving for a cr\\u00e8me br\\u00fbl\\u00e9e - could be easily shared, in my opinion. no one could finish theirs. loved the caramel decor that graced the top. \n\nall in all, it's a very romantic setting. taking the elevator up makes you feel...special, for lack of a better word. would i come again? mais, oui!", 
            "i don't know where to start! my girlfriend and i were in vegas attending the electric daisy carnival which coincided with our 2 year anniversary. immediately we started looking for the finest restaurants las vegas boulevard had to offer. we tossed around ideas, and drew up a list. the eiffel tower restaurant had  fantastic price point that didn't degrade service or quality. of course we dressed up for the occasion, however i did note that some patrons where wearing beach shorts and t-shirts. not really the kind of ambiance i'd like when spending around $400 including tip. but alas i dined like royalty and enjoyed my stay. i started off with the <mark>Heirloom Tomato, California Burrata, Balsamic Aspic, Basil, Extra Virgin Olive Oil</mark> salad. it was beyond words and more than just a salad. the flavors that my palate were introduced to were unbelievable. my lovely girlfriend went with the warm maine lobster, white wine braised baby leeks, mustard vinaigrette  that was sublime. tender, succulent and bursting with flavor. a light size portion that is more about taste and saving room for the next course. for my entree i went with the char <mark>'The King' <mark>'The Queen' Broiled Beef Tenderloin Filet Mignon</mark></mark>, rossini style, <mark>Muscovy Duck Breast, Camargue Rice, Pistachio, Sauce Foie Gras</mark>, <mark>Rossini Style <mark>'The King' <mark>'The Queen' Broiled Beef Tenderloin Filet Mignon</mark></mark>, Foie Gras, Truffle Sauce</mark>. one of the best meals i've ever had the privilege to enjoy. definitely worth the $79 it was priced at. ill include a picture of this wonderful bit of paradise. i was hesitant to try <mark>Muscovy Duck Breast, Camargue Rice, Pistachio, Sauce Foie Gras</mark> but my curiosity was rewarded with an delicacy  that is no longer available in los angeles. it was cooked to perfection and looked as immaculate as it was delectable. my girlfriend had the prime aged bone-in ribeye, caramelized onions and added the black <mark>Rossini Style <mark>'The King' <mark>'The Queen' Broiled Beef Tenderloin Filet Mignon</mark></mark>, Foie Gras, Truffle Sauce</mark> that complimented it exquisitely. a magnificent slab of meat suitable for a king or queen in this case. bought some cocktails that seemed overpriced but the craftsmanship put into concocting them is well worth the steep price. the servers go out the way to make you feel comfortable, and for the time that you are there like you were as important as the president. never did i feel hovered over or stared at as if i didn't belong. my visit was a little less than a year ago and to this day 4/23/2014 i am still raving about it. we are going back to edc las vegas this year and are struggling to find another restaurant to match the eiffel tower restaurant. and the killer view of the fountains and strip is more romantic than can be described. definitely a meal that will stand out for a long time. adieu!"

            "a nitty-gritty layman's guide to the eiffel tower restaurant\n\nreservations:  a must, particularly if you'd like to be seated during pique lunch or dinner hour.  if you're flexible, i.e. supper at 9:45, take a chance and walk in.\n\nattire:  business casual. (we were somewhat dressier.)  i witnessed a couple being turned away because of their jeans and tee shirts.\n\nservice:  spot on.  our server, michael, was friendly and helpful.  we never wanted for a thing.\n\nwine:  if you're a connoisseur, i suspect you'll delight in the wine list.  if you're like me, a person who appreciates a california red, but doesn't want to spend an arm and a leg, your choices are limited.  you can order shiraz at $12 a glass, or go for a bottle of rodney strong merlot @ $59, which is what we did.  over-priced, but less money than virtually everything else.  by the way, if you choose to bring your own wine, expect a ludicrous corkage fee of $75 per bottle.\n\nprix fixe: the six course tasting menu is $125 per person.  wine pairing is an additional $79 and if you'd like a souffl\\u00e9, tack on $8 more.  two things to note: 1) if one person wants the prix fixe, everyone at the table must be in accord and order the same. 2) there is no flexibility in the  menu. courses are as presented with no choice or substitutions. (based on reviews of the venison, we decided to order a la carte.)\n\nour meals\nappetizers:   of the appetizers, two were particularly good:  the casco bay sea scallops and my cold <mark>Muscovy Duck Breast, Camargue Rice, Pistachio, Sauce Foie Gras</mark> which was melt-in-your-mouth delicious.  i could have done without the accompanying <mark>Cold <mark>Muscovy Duck Breast, Camargue Rice, Pistachio, Sauce Foie Gras</mark> Torchon, Duck Prosciutto, Fig Compote</mark> or toast points.  (make your selection from the bread basket instead.)\n\nsalad: my husband and daughter ordered the market green salad, which appeared unremarkable.  better choice may be what's called the  \"non-traditional\" caesar salad with <mark>Non-Traditional Caesar Salad, Warm Anchovies, Capers and Garlic Vinaigrette</mark>.\n\nentrees:  perhaps the best received dish was t's roasted rack of lamb and tomato tart.  he thought it impeccable.  my muscovy duck breast was good, but not as tasty as duck i recently had in atlanta. my daughter enjoyed her <mark>'The King' <mark>'The Queen' Broiled Beef Tenderloin Filet Mignon</mark></mark>, but again, there was nothing extraordinary about it.  you'll find that meats are high quality,  and cooked to perfection.  if you want it rare, you'll get it rare.\n\ndessert:  curious about the \"acclaimed\" souffl\\u00e9s, we ordered two.  (note that the order must go in, early on.)  none of us were bowled over.  the chocolate souffl\\u00e9 was ordinary, the caramel somewhat better.   perhaps this is petty, but coffee at $7 per person seems excessive.....\n\nin summation: i vacillate between three and four stars.  we spent $500 for dinner that was indeed good, but hardly stand-out.  i'm happy for the experience ; the view of the fountains, as everyone points out, can't be beat.  am i glad we came?  sure!  will we return?  nope."

            "if you haven't been, you really need to experience the eiffel tower restaurant. first, the tricky part is to find the elevator, it is somewhere in the middle of the casino (tip: just look up at the legs of the eiffel tower because they come through the ceiling and find the middle that way). there were two host's (one female, one male) to greet you at the elevator (i assumed to confirm reservations or whatever), so they tell me that there is a dress code and shorts are going to cut it (it was 112 degrees out and i'm not going to walk around in slacks that for sure), so i turn to amanda and say sorry, then thank the host anyways. but then he says \"hold on, what size pants are you\", he says we have a couple pairs if you wouldn't mind throwing them on before coming up. i say \"sure\" and i almost dropped my pants right there but he said \"the washroom is just across the way, sir\". as i go change the male host proceeds to escort amanda up the elevator and to a table. when i finished, the lady kindly escorts me up (i couldn't figure out why we were getting pampered so but then i saw the bill!!). \n\nthe elevator was fun, you get a chance to wave or stick up your nose (which ever you prefer) at all the people outside before you get to your floor. so the elevator opens and it's the kitchen, i'm kind of scratching my head but then the lovely host grabs my arm and escorts me around and out of the kitchen then to my table. you have to keep in mind that the pants that they gave me are at least 3 times bigger then i am, so i'm almost waddling try to get to my seat trying to make sure i don't lose the pants and flash all of vegas. \n\nthere are two things that make this restaurant unbelievable. first, the view is amazing, three sides of floor to ceiling glass. one side the north side of the strip, the other the south, but the front is all the bellagio. if you know anything about the bellagio, then you know about the musical fountain which occurs every 15 minutes. so you get to watch this show if you have seats in the front (tip for the guys... it's very romantic). the second thing is the menu, it is absolutely insane... chilled fennel vichyssoise with shrimp, caviar, fish, fowl, and even a vegetarian dish. unfortunately for us, we were already full from dinner (fortunate for my wallet though, this place is up there $25 to $55 a plate, $340 for 50 grams** <mark>Trio of American Caviar</mark>). still, i wish had some caviar, maybe next time. the service was excellent too. \n\nyou must go!! \n\n** 1 gram is about the weight of a bic pen cap.", 
            "our one year anniversary dinner! made reservation at 8, changed to 9:30, still requested a window seat with bellagio fountain and strip views, host girl was so nice, gave us a window seat before 9:30, great job! i had a specialty cocktail at the bar, red velvet, it was so yummy! sweet but strong, liked it a lot. \n\ni can't even describe how amazing the views were.... i had photos of that, please check them out! our waiter greeted us very friendly, gave us wine list first, expensive bottles of wine, red, white, sparkling, i didn't see one bottle less than $70, we ordered bottle of champagne around $100, it was so good! we took time to look through the menu while sipping on our champagne. \n\ntheir complimentary bread was a big tray, server carry it around for dining people to choose what kind of bread we want, they gave us a creamy soup as dipping sauce,  butter too. i didn't like the cold bread and soup, but it was a great dipping sauce, bread tasted so delicious with it.\n\nour amazing food:\n<mark>Trio of American Caviar</mark>, golden whitefish, american sturgeon, salmon roe, 28 grams each, with creme fraiche, chives, blinis and toast: they were heavenly delicious! beautiful presentation! we enjoyed every single bit of it very much\n\ncream of mushrooms soup, wild rice galette, crispy shallots: so delicious, soup was very flavorful\n\nmaine lobster salad, roasted butter squash, wilted kale, old cider vinaigrette: the kale was so yummy! the lobster was very tender and flavorful, loved loved it! \n\nfricasse of escargot, sweetbreads, fennel, farm raised poached egg, pinot noir jus: the escargot was so tender, but not very flavorful, the poached egg was perfect, i still loved it cause i wanted something light as entree for that night. \n\nchar <mark>'The King' <mark>'The Queen' Broiled Beef Tenderloin Filet Mignon</mark></mark>, red wine sauce: hubby asked for extra red wine sauce, he said the filet was one of the best he has ever had for a very very long time! he absolutely loved the red wine sauce!\n\n<mark>Gratinee Creamed Spinach and Mushroom</mark>: too creamy to our liking, but still yummy\n\nwe didn't order desert, the portions were really big for french cuisine! but the restaurant gave us chocolate mousse for our anniversary! they even put chocolate \"happy anniversary\" on the plate.... aww... it was just too sweet and beautiful! \n\ni was so happy for our memorable anniversary dinner, with beautiful views from our seat, over the top service, tasty champagne, delicious food, what more could i ask?.... it was just amazing! $350 dinner was very well worth it....\n\na perfect restaurant for romantic dinner date or special occasions!"

            "amazing view, excellent service, spectacular food. 5-star service all the way. we arrived a few minutes early and were whisked up an elevator to the eiffel tower restaurant. we were promptly greeted and taken to our table for two -- literally looking out at the bellagio fountains. it was the best view on the strip!! \n\nour meal started with sparkling water and an amuse bouche of a tiny parmesan cheese puff pastry. a perfect little bite indeed!! i ordered the warm lobster, braised leeks and celery appetizer. the sauce was rich and delicious, the lobster was delicate but boldly flavorful. it was perfectly seasoned. my wife ordered the blue cheese souffle pudding with a walnut pecan salad. she loved it. loved it like she wanted to lick the plate clean loved it. loved it like i had get a little pushy to try a bite loved it. \n\nfor an entree i ordered the duck prepared two ways--a sliced breast served medium-rare and a leg confit with wild rice and a rich sauce. every bite was tender and juicy. my wife ordered the slow roasted filet of salmon with a <mark>Slow Roasted Filet of Pacific Salmon, Pinot Noir Sauce</mark>. she said it was the best salmon she had ever tasted. we opted for a side of the pommes dauphines which were essentially mashed potato filled tater tots. awesome. every bit of our meal was amazing. we sipped on their signature cocktail the eiffel affair and ordered souffles for dessert. i went with the chocolate souffle and my wife had the grand marnier souffle. both were delicious. each came with a sauce (mine had a chocolate and a creme anglaise sauce). probably the best dessert i've ever had. thank you eiffel tower for making my belated honeymoon dinner worth it.", 
            "my first experience here with my family was awesome. it was a nice surprise for us to see the kitchen when we got out of the elevator. we got to see that they were diligently preparing the food. our waiter was very attentive and helpful. he answered all our questions and gave us good recommendations. \n\nwe ordered shrimp spaghetti veggies salad, slow-roasted filet atlantic salmon with <mark>Slow Roasted Filet of Pacific Salmon, Pinot Noir Sauce</mark>, roasted semi-boneless chicken with butternut squash, and char <mark>'The King' <mark>'The Queen' Broiled Beef Tenderloin Filet Mignon</mark></mark> with red wine sauce. we ended up trying each other dishes since all the food looked so yummy. the salad came with 6-7 jumbo shrimps! the salad tasted light and healthy. my salmon dish came out to be perfect. it smelled great and tasted soft and amazing with the <mark>Slow Roasted Filet of Pacific Salmon, Pinot Noir Sauce</mark>. the chicken came out to be the biggest portion out of all our dishes. it tasted differently from the typical marinated chicken we usually ate. although it was smallest portion, the steak turned out to be excellent. it was medium-rare cooked. it tasted tender and juicy with the red wine sauce. for dessert, we had the banana souffle. it's the best i've tasted!!! highly recommended!!! our bill came out to be almost $400...it was because we also ordered wine and cocktails.\n\noverall the atmosphere was very cozy and romantic. they have a gorgeous view, and the restaurant itself is nicely decorated. great service throughout the dinner. two reasons i didn't give it 5 stars: 1) food and drinks a bit overpriced 2) small food portion.\n\nmy tips:\n\n1) make a reservation, so you don't have to wait. (you can't request sitting arrangement, i tried)\n\n2) though you don't have to dress-up nicely, i recommend it so you can take pics. plus it's fun dressing up. :d (those who worry about dress code, yes you can wear jeans, but wear it with a nice top and you should be good.)\n\n3) bring a camera, so you can take lots of pics!! (ladies- when you visit the restroom, take your camera with you. it has a nice arrangement. ;p)\n\n4) for those who worry about $$$ and not being full enough, i highly recommend you to eat a big lunch first. if you're going with a partner, you can always order one meal and share. another option is you can always eat dinner somewhere else first, and then stop by this restaurant to enjoy some desserts instead. you can never go wrong with desserts. (kids not recommended because they might not enjoy/like the fancy food. plus i don't remember seeing a kid's menu)\n\n5) i recommend going with a date since the setting is very romantic at night, and you would have a better chance of sitting by the window where you can see the gorgeous view and the bellagio's water show rather than with a big group.\n\nenjoy your food!", 
            "i took my husband and some of his family here for a reunion meal, and everyone loved the experience.  laurent, the restaurant manager whom i contacted by email before our visit, ensured that we had a fabulous window table with an awesome view of the bellagio fountains.  our wait staff gave us attentive, patient service.  and the chefs provided delicious meals.  my husband deemed his salmon with <mark>Slow Roasted Filet of Pacific Salmon, Pinot Noir Sauce</mark> \"the best salmon ever.\"  i was a huge fan of the grand marnier souffle and the expensive ($18) specialty cocktails.  our four guests ordered versions of the <mark>'The King' <mark>'The Queen' Broiled Beef Tenderloin Filet Mignon</mark></mark>, and all seemed pleased except for the one who ordered her filet medium well (it was more well done, and therefore tougher, than she had expected it to be).  all of the sides (<mark>Classic Potato Gratin</mark>, green beans, brussels sprouts, <mark>Gratinee Creamed Spinach and Mushroom</mark> spaetzle) were tasty.  the maine lobster salad was very good, though it's worth noting that it contained far less kale than i had expected, just a little taste rather than salad-like greens.  the meal was, of course, seriously expensive ($717 for the six of us, including tax and the mandatory 18% gratuity (the gratuity was, i assume, mandatory because we were a larger group)).  we knew that going in (the menu, with prices, is available on the restaurant's website), however, so we were not unpleasantly surprised.  if you can afford to ignore the cost, eating at the eiffel tower restaurant at paris las vegas is a fun, tasty, memorable experience (the views truly are unforgettable).",

            "in a word... souffl\\u00e9. their weightless, fluffy, and perfectly prepared chocolate souffl\\u00e9 is utterly exquisite. complemented by a stellar view of the vegas strip and a front row view of the bellagio's dancing water show, this delicious dessert is well worth the the 25 minute preparation time. it was an exceptional way to finish off a delicious meal that began with a warm lobster and fennel appetizer followed with a moist and tender filet of salmon in a <mark>Slow Roasted Filet of Pacific Salmon, Pinot Noir Sauce</mark>. the eiffel tower restaurant is not likely to disappoint."

            "so this is the second night of my friends quater life crisis and also the eve of his birthday.  so of course we end up at the eiffel tower restauarant.  first off you take an elevator up to the restaurant and you head towards the kitchen.  then to the dining room that over looks the strip (it's not as high as you would think).  we get a table over looing the strip (nice).  \n\nour server comes and asks if we would like to order a bottle of wine, and i said yes of course.  a sommelier comes by and asks what are my preferences.  i don't like reds, nor do i like dry whites.  i said i like the sweeter and fruitier variety.  she comes back with this sauvignon blanc i forget what but it had lychee in it.  oh my god!  the best wine i have ever had and i'm a fool for forgetting the name.  \n\nwe get our choice of breads and we ordered our food.  i got the lamb chop with escarole and potato puree.  mmmmm the sauce that came with it...i would have drunk it till i drowned.  we also ordered scalloped potatoes, mushrooms, and asparagus with <mark>Alaskan Wild Black Cod, Cauliflower Cous Cous, Lemon Confit, Charmoula Jus</mark> to share.  all great sides with my meal.  my friend ordered the steak au puoive and was delicious the peppercorn sauce was not as over powering as i would have thought.  friend number 2 ordered the chillean sea bass with roasted vegetables- probably my least favorite but it was still good.  friend number 3 pan seared chicken with meyer <mark>Alaskan Wild Black Cod, Cauliflower Cous Cous, Lemon Confit, Charmoula Jus</mark> and hari cot verts- really good chicken was moist, nothing spectacular though.  friends number 4 roasted wild salmon with balsamic reduction and roasted figs- interesting dish, lots of flavor, but i have to say i would have enjoyed it a lot more if it was prepared with a different type of fish.  dessert?  my friend got a shot glass with a cappaccino mousse along with chocolate caligraphy saying happy 25th birthday!  forever tormenting his demise of turning 25 in his quarter life crisis.  that alone made this dinner worth it. \n\ntotal= 475.46 plus we tipped the sommelier nicely on what was simply the best wine i ever had."

            "the restaurant raises its sun blockers around 6pm/7pm to reveal a summer sun set against nevada's rocky mountain. construction is going on between the bellagio and monte carlo, and so cranes are also in the picture.\n\nthe service is impeccable. everything was on perfect cue. we did not have to verbalize additional requests. with subtle eye contact and body language, the waiter decanted additional wine and flawlessly poured the wine in the polished wine glasses. he removed the plates in a timely and quiet manner. the highlight was the complimentary dessert tray. my favorite was the grape jelly coated in sugar crystals.\n\noh, the food? it was alright. the <mark>Muscovy Duck Breast, Camargue Rice, Pistachio, Sauce Foie Gras</mark> slice was a fairly generous amount. in its rarity, i had farm-raised sturgeon, which i thought could have been warmer than lukewarm.\n\nwhat really ticked me off was the bathroom attendant who twisted my and my friends' arms for $5 gratuity for a mere three individually wrapped lifesaver breath mints. turn off.", 
            "pretty pricey, but always a great place to visit in vegas.  i went here twice (once w/ a bunch of friends, another time w/ my husband), and had great meals both times.  when i went here w/ my hubby it was especially nice since we got to sit in one of the best seats in the house, with a fantastic view of the bellagio fountains (i asked for it when i booked the place on opentable more than a month before, and i can't believe they actually gave it to me).\n\nwhen i was last there, i had the seared <mark>Muscovy Duck Breast, Camargue Rice, Pistachio, Sauce Foie Gras</mark> appetizer, filet topped with <mark>Muscovy Duck Breast, Camargue Rice, Pistachio, Sauce Foie Gras</mark> (you can tell i was totally jonesing for <mark>Muscovy Duck Breast, Camargue Rice, Pistachio, Sauce Foie Gras</mark> that day), and the chocolate souffle for dessert.  mmmm...yum.  i know there are probably a lot of fancier and better places in vegas, but i still think this place deserves 4 stars for a wonderful meal, great service, and an unbeatable view.", 
            "oooh la la!  zees es soo freunch!\nmadame y monseiur dined en ze eiffel tower!\nit was soooo freunch!  oui!  oui!\n\n<mark>Muscovy Duck Breast, Camargue Rice, Pistachio, Sauce Foie Gras</mark>, sabayon, escargots, truffle... oui, oui!!\nstinky freunch cheezes, oui!!\n\nsilly americans!  i thumb my nose at your general direction...", 
            "i seriously wanted to avoid coming here, and i really should've after reading some not-so-consistent reviews.  but we were celebrating both of my parent's birthdays, and they were insistent on eating at eiffel tower.  (oh well, gotta make the parents happy)\n\nok, well let's get started.  as you get off the elevator, you're immediately presented with the kitchen which is actually kind of cool.  the nice lady walks you to the hostess and so far i'm feeling hopeful.  we get seated immediately in a decent booth, but we really can't see much of a view.  i did specially request a nice view, but that didnt work out so well.  the atmosphere was just ok, and kind of on the loud side.\n\nwe started off with with the roasted <mark>Muscovy Duck Breast, Camargue Rice, Pistachio, Sauce Foie Gras</mark>, white almond dusted sea scallops and warm lobster salad for appetizers.  the <mark>Muscovy Duck Breast, Camargue Rice, Pistachio, Sauce Foie Gras</mark> was good but i've had much better, and the accompanying marinated grapes weren't the best match.  you really need something sweeter to go with the rich flavor of <mark>Muscovy Duck Breast, Camargue Rice, Pistachio, Sauce Foie Gras</mark>.  the scallops were cooked perfectly, and the lobster salad was probably my favorite.  at this point you're probably wondering - why 2 stars?  well, read on my friend...\n\nfor entrees, we ordered filet of seabass, venison chop, surf and turf beef tenderloin, and the bone-in ribeye.  the seabass was cooked just right but the seasoning was non-existent.  the venison was cooked perfectly as well and we were pretty pleased with that dish.  the surf & turf beef tenderloin was quite a disappointment.  the crab meat was like a dried out crab cake, and although the tenderloin was cooked perfectly, it had no flavor at all.  it didn't even have a nice char, which definitely makes a good steak.  the ribeye was probably the best entree of them all.  nice and juicy and actually seasoned well too.  we also had a side order of scalloped potatoes which was a total waste of money.  at this point the food has been just ok and if you look at the prices, it's really not worth it at all.  but i guess it is vegas and almost all of the high end restaurants are at least $40 per entree (easy).  am i just spoiled with the quality and service of san francisco restaurants?  i haven't yet mentioned anything about service yet, but it was just ok at this point.  nothing like the dining room at the ritz in sf, and our server seemed way too busy with another table that he really didn't come to check up on us at all.  the rest of the staff was fairly attentive, but i would expect way better service for a restaurant like this. \n\nah yes, dessert.  my absolute favorite course of any meal.  i'm hoping that my opinion of the restaurant will change with dessert.  of course like everyone else, we did get suckered into ordering a souffle at the beginning of the meal, so that was already on its way.  so we wait, and wait, and still no dessert menu.  someone finally brings us new place settings, but still no dessert menu.  do they not have a dessert menu?  we can't even find our server because he obviously has way too many tables.  someone finally brings our souffle, and at that point we asked him for dessert menus.  he says he'll bring them right away....yeah right.  the souffle was delicious i must say, and they were kind enough to bring out complimentary desserts to wish my parents a happy birthday.  but where's my dessert menu??! ! at some point i just gave up because i was so annoyed.  now you know why i give eiffel tower restaurant only 2 stars.\n\nby the end of the meal, i am annoyed that we have a huge bill to pay and we got a less than satisfactory fine dining experience.  i'm really wishing that i had just made reservations at picasso in the bellagio or at guy savoy instead.  i could've even just gone back to delmonico's, michael mina, bouchon, fleur de lys, all where i've had way better experiences than this.  \n\nin conclusion...\nfood=3 stars\nambiance=3 stars\nservice = 1 star (pretty much non-existant)\ndessert=1 star (for not ever bringing me a dessert menu)\nwhich averages out to 2 stars.", 
            "i've been here twice for dinner, once for lunch, and i'm torn between which is better. \n\nambience: everything about the ambience is great. from the fancy elevator ride up through the to-scale eiffel tower to the open kitchen to the beautiful romantic views of the bellagio and it's famous fountain show, this was unbeatable. \n\nservice: we've always gotten great service here. the waiters are charming and unobtrusive. the food is served at perfect temperatures and the presentation is always beautiful. thankfully, the beauty of the food matches the delicious tastes as well! \n\nprice: yes, it's pricey, but oh so worth it! if you're going to splurge one tine for a meal in vegas, this is the place to do it!\n\nfood: let's get down to business. the food is awesome. and for a french restaurant, this place is neither \"overly french\" in that uppity manner, and the food is ripe for any palate, although, yes, the portions aren't huge. the foods are very flavorful though, and don't require large portions; in that true french fashion, the food is rich and luxurious in your mouth.  i'd recommend you try something completely new for you, be it the escargot, the <mark>Muscovy Duck Breast, Camargue Rice, Pistachio, Sauce Foie Gras</mark>, or even just something fancy that you can't pronounce. and don't forget dessert! seriously, every single dessert is heavenly!", 
            "delicious!!!  the ambiance is wonderful and it overlooks bellagio's water show which happens every 15 minutes or so.  for starters we had the <mark>Muscovy Duck Breast, Camargue Rice, Pistachio, Sauce Foie Gras</mark> (hot) and it was perfect. i had the duck and it was amazing. my husband got the steak and he said it was one of the best steaks he's ever had. that is a bold statement coming from a steak lover who eats a lot of steak! we ended the night with a chocolate  souffle which was a perfect end to a perfect meal.  i've been to many fine dining restaurants in the city, and this is one of my favs....", 
            "part of me feels like fine dining should be transcendent and have this major wow factor. by nature i want to hate places like this... in a hotel, overpriced, etc.. but i can't fault them on anything, really. they have a large varied menu of solid french food. rabbit? check. duck? check. <mark>Muscovy Duck Breast, Camargue Rice, Pistachio, Sauce Foie Gras</mark>? check. also a huge array of fish. if you're looking for a run of the mill \"nice\" dinner that won't disappoint and would appeal to anyone, this is your place. awesome view, awesome ambience, and although pricey, the food is solid. not 'omg this is the best food i've ever tasted', just solid and predictable and good. sometimes you don't want noveau california cuisine.. you just want something reliable and tasty.\n\ni had the seared <mark>Muscovy Duck Breast, Camargue Rice, Pistachio, Sauce Foie Gras</mark>, and i got the ahi tuna i had last time again. both incredible. dessert was a pistachio souffle. they get points for originality on that one.. plus the flavor was awesome. \n\nafter eating at some of the more edgy places in town recently (cut, strip steak, shibuya, little buddha, etc) and being disappointed.. this place is 2/2 on fabulous experiences.", 
            "y'know the fact that i was almost an hour late yet the hostess was willing to save my table for me when i called should give them the 4 stars. but it was the excellent food! i had the warm lobster salad that melted in my mouth and the lamb which was so delish! service i hate to admit was too slow but the food made up for it and the fact that they didn't give us any attitude made me very happy. i would definitely go there again and again. hubby had the <mark>Muscovy Duck Breast, Camargue Rice, Pistachio, Sauce Foie Gras</mark> and it too was freakin good. eiffel tower you rock~!", 
            "the view and the food are among the best... second perhaps only to the mix at mandalay. while i had eaten a very expensive and paid for by a business partner dinner here a few years ago, this time i opted for a much more reasonable (by vegas standards) lunch with my wife. she couldn't have been happier with the view of the bellagio fountains, and i couldn't have been happier with my lunch of <mark>Muscovy Duck Breast, Camargue Rice, Pistachio, Sauce Foie Gras</mark> with duck prosciutto and butternut squash soup.", 
            "we happened to notice there was going to be easter brunch here, and we thought it sounded fun, and the menu looked good so we decided to go.\n\nthe view really is amazing.  i would completely recommend going here with parities of two, because you get an amazing view of the strip and the fountains at the bellagio.\n\nthe service was phenomenal.  more than to be expected.  \n\nthe food was pretty damn good too.  we ordered a bottle of champagne, and they started us with a little amuse bouche of parmesan flan, which was quite tasty, and some cheese puffs. we both got appetizers, he got the <mark>Muscovy Duck Breast, Camargue Rice, Pistachio, Sauce Foie Gras</mark>, and i got the blue cheese souffle pudding.  the <mark>Muscovy Duck Breast, Camargue Rice, Pistachio, Sauce Foie Gras</mark> was probably better, but i'm a huge fan of blue cheese, and the flavors were subtle.  here's where the meal gets fun.  his entree was the omelet souffle and mine was the baked crepes.  the waiter wanted to make sure we weren't in a hurry since the omelet souffle takes about twenty minutes to fire after our appetizers.  we were fine with that.\n\nso after our appetizers were finished we waited and waited for our meal and nothing showed up.  finally he decided to go the restroom and the manager shows up to tell us there was some sort of mistake and our order got lost.  that's fine, we can wait, we really had nothing else going on that day.  so they left to make sure it started and after the bf came back, i suggested he try to get some free drinks out of it while i ran to the restroom.  \n\ni came back and there were two glasses of champagne!  the waiter took it upon himself to give us a couple of more glasses.  rock on!  when the food finally showed up, the manager told us the entire meal was being comped, so enjoy ourselves!  rock on again!\n\nafter all that the meal was free, and very tasty.  we said we might go back sometime for dinner if we're back in vegas.  i even picked up a copy of the cookbook because the food was good and i wanted to try some of the recipes!", 
            "beautiful view, comfortable seating, excellent food, good service. we decided last minute to try this place and i'm glad we did! the view is gorgeous with a perfect view of the bellagio fountains. we only had lunch, but i bet at dinner time, it's an amazing view.\n\n- cream of mushroom soup: creamy, smooth, perfect balanced flavor\n- <mark>Muscovy Duck Breast, Camargue Rice, Pistachio, Sauce Foie Gras</mark> wrapped in duck prosciutto with <mark>Cold <mark>Muscovy Duck Breast, Camargue Rice, Pistachio, Sauce Foie Gras</mark> Torchon, Duck Prosciutto, Fig Compote</mark>: mouthwatering, delicious, very smooth, melts in your mouth \n- moroccan lamb burger: flavorful, huge portion, chips okay\n- seafood salad: simple, refreshing, variety of seafood\n- petit fours: nice, light, sweet ending to a nice meal\n\nservice was okay at first and the server warmed up to us at the end of the meal after he found out we were from san francisco. he was, nonetheless, very attentive and polite throughout the meal. it was a very nice, relaxing lunch on our last day in vegas despite an obnoxious french family that made a big fuss about seating arrangements. overall, great food, service, and the view is gorgeous!", 
            "located inside the eiffel towel in front of the paris hotel (you go in by means of the elevator inside the paris hotel at the back of the front casino).  i've never been to paris (but have always wanted to!), and this is as close as it gets!  the view inside is breath taking.  at night you can see the whole strip lit up below, the arc de triomphe, and the bellagio water show.\n\nas with most upscale french restaurants, the menu is seasonal and changes from time to time.  the food was so delicious!  i almost died when i ate the <mark>Muscovy Duck Breast, Camargue Rice, Pistachio, Sauce Foie Gras</mark>, it was that good!  i went with a couple of girl friends, and we all loved the ambience, the food, and the staff was great too.  call me girly, but i'd love to come back one day on a romantic date hee hee.", 
            "i took my girlfriend here for lunch. i absolutely love it and is worth every penny. this restaurant is what i call fine dining. the bus boy was always standing on the side and helped orchestrate the delivery of our food and refills.\n\nthe server was nice and professional. the ambiance is fantastic as it is intimate ... until a family with kids were seated behind us but they weren't rowdy. :) the best part was seated right by the window with a perfect view of the bellagio fountain.\n\nthe food was fabulous and well presented. this is what we ordered:\n- cheese bread with an orange pepper flan; it's used as a spread for the cheese bread; wonderful! we each had our own little tiny cup.\n- <mark>Cold <mark>Muscovy Duck Breast, Camargue Rice, Pistachio, Sauce Foie Gras</mark> Torchon, Duck Prosciutto, Fig Compote</mark> (<mark>Muscovy Duck Breast, Camargue Rice, Pistachio, Sauce Foie Gras</mark> was perfect and not salty and who would have thought the <mark>Cold <mark>Muscovy Duck Breast, Camargue Rice, Pistachio, Sauce Foie Gras</mark> Torchon, Duck Prosciutto, Fig Compote</mark> complemented the <mark>Muscovy Duck Breast, Camargue Rice, Pistachio, Sauce Foie Gras</mark> perfectly. it was a rich slightly salty and sweet tangy taste)\n- crab toast a la francais, sauce remoulade (excellent but very rich and crab tasted fresh none of your ... artificial crab)\n- aged parmesan crusted chicken, <mark>Classic Potato Gratin</mark>, vegetables (rich but flavorful\n- ordered a cocktail and a orange creme drink\n\ntotal: $87\n\nthey even gave my girlfriend a happy birthday chocolate mousse. i would definitely go back.", 
            "by far one of the best places to go in vegas!  the views of bellagio and the strip was awesome!  the food was great, and the service was superb!\n     definitely a good idea to make reservations, this place gets packed!  we started off with the cold foie geas and blue cheese souffle, both were decent but not outstanding.  the blue cheese souffle reminded me of bread pudding, it tasted okay but wasnt anything special.  the cold <mark>Muscovy Duck Breast, Camargue Rice, Pistachio, Sauce Foie Gras</mark> was a tad salty even with bread, i think the seared <mark>Muscovy Duck Breast, Camargue Rice, Pistachio, Sauce Foie Gras</mark> might have tasted better.   the bread selection was good, i liked the french baguette.  our bread came out cold, so the waiter gladly brought us hot bread on the spot!  \n     my friends ordered entrees of salmon, sea bass, duck breast, and lamb chops.  the seafood dishes were okay, nothing to rave about.  the grilled duck breast was excellent!  the grilled lamb chops were by far the best ive ever had!  it came out tender, juicy, and had no gamey flavor at all!  it had the texture of a <mark>'The King' <mark>'The Queen' Broiled Beef Tenderloin Filet Mignon</mark></mark> and taste of a prime rib, which was quite unique...definitely a great entree!  \n     we ordered two souffles, a pistachio and banana nut...both were great!  the souffles came out hot, super light, perfect texture..by far the best souffles ive ever had!  the banana nut tasted excellent!  the pistachio souffle was also unique, both were very tasty!  i'd come back here just for the souffles..and they are so light that you can eat two of them by yourself!\n    overall, the service here is excellent, all the waiters are super nice and constantly check up to make sure everything is satisfying.  the food was perfect, but the portions were on the small side.  the souffles are amazing, definitely a must-have!  prices here a little high, especially for such small portions, but everything was cooked perfect and presented nicely!  this would be a perfect spot to take a date, nice cozy and dimly lit place with a romantic feel, and great views of the strip, including the bellagio water show.", 
            "a beautiful evening.\n\ni took my parents while we were visiting vegas.  they love cheesy tourist stuff and i wanted to treat them to a nice meal.  well, it wasn't as cheesy as i expected.  as soon as we stepped into the dining room, i felt like we were floating above the strip.  the dining room is dark so the lights of vegas looked amazing all around us.  the service was top notch and the food was fabulous.\n\nit's probably the best view in vegas.  the best tables are in the front of the dining room right next to the windows facing the bellagio fountain, but we didn't get those tables because most of those tables are for 2 ppl and we had 3.  larger 4 ppl tables are behind those.  so if you want the best view, it's probably best to go as a couple.  however, even from our table at the side of the restaurant, we were able to enjoy the bellagio fountain shows and also get a great view down the strip.  i could see aria, nyny, excalibur, and luxor from where i was sitting!\n\nwe all had the $89 pre-fiix tasting menu and it was worth it.  every course was melt in your mouth yum.  (6 courses including dessert)  here's the tasting menu: \nhttp://www.eiffeltowerrestaurant.com/images/eiffel/pdfs/menus/tasting.pdf\nit's really the best deal since you get a bit of lobster, halibut, and lamb.  i'm not a huge lamb fan, but their lamb was great!  the tasting menu had smaller portions, but i was stuffed by the end of the meal.  we also dished out an additional $6 each to get the souffle instead of the regular dessert.  again, totally worth it.  we each got a different flavor and sampled each others: <mark>Muscovy Duck Breast, Camargue Rice, Pistachio, Sauce Foie Gras</mark> marnier, and chocolate..  all were beautifully sweet and fluffy but with their own personalities.  definitely don't miss out on the souffle.\n\nthe bar looked like a good alternative if you don't want to spend the $$ on dinner.  but once you see the view, you might want to send the whole evening there.", 
            "i somehow managed to sneak in here without a reservation and was very pleased. though not as tasty as le cirque over at belagio its still quite amazing. \n\nas you come up the elevator there is a small waiting lounge where we had to wait for a table. it was comfortable and they have some great beers. as we walked to our table we could see out the window. out the window! crazy view!\n\nthe room is very open and bright like almost like an outdoor cafe. there was always a member of the wait staff at our table with something for us. \n\nthey have a wide variety of breads they came around with. for starters i had both the <mark>Muscovy Duck Breast, Camargue Rice, Pistachio, Sauce Foie Gras</mark> and a salmon plate. both where fantastic. for the entrees i was able to try the <mark>'The King' <mark>'The Queen' Broiled Beef Tenderloin Filet Mignon</mark></mark> and their duck. both of course...fantastic! their entree sauces are so tasty and look so pretty.\n\ncompare to the rest of the vegas casino restaurants i have been to this ones atmosphere was so much more casual and friendly. it made the whole experience really fun.", 
            "last time i ate here was seven years ago for my first wedding anniversary. eiffel tower was my first high dollar meal. it was so good that i'm returning to give it the five stars it deserves. here's why:\n\n1. very best view of the strip\n2. outstanding service\n3. amazing food at a (fairly) reasonable, fine-dining price. \n4. perfect atmosphere (great lighting, comfortable chairs, lovely windows, well-placed tables, unobtrusive music).\n\ncompared to renoir at the mirage (which closed the year after we tried it), the prix fixe menu was half the price and twice as good. \n\nthe most memorable part of dinner was the <mark>Muscovy Duck Breast, Camargue Rice, Pistachio, Sauce Foie Gras</mark>. it was love at first taste and i have not had better versions of the same dish since.\n\nif you're just looking for a great view and place to chill, without dropping hundreds, hang out at the bar. \n\nfyi, i think flip flops are sexy on men, but this place disagrees. dress shoes are required for the boys.", 
            "great atmosphere, awesome view, decent food, pricey.  i took some customers out to eiffel tower last week and had a good time.  the decor was beautiful yet subdued (as a french joint should be).   you have to go up an elevator several floors - the result is one of the best views of the strip.  it's great just to look out through the glass at all the lights and buildings.  if you're seated well, you can even catch the bellagio water show from your table.\n\nfoodwise, i think it was good, but not awesome.  for a french place, the french bread was meh - you can do better at the grocery store.  my <mark>Muscovy Duck Breast, Camargue Rice, Pistachio, Sauce Foie Gras</mark> was excellent though.  i think it scared off a couple of my customers haha.  my rack of lamb entree was pretty tasty, though it was a little hard to cut.  \n\nbeing a chicago foodie (hmm that probably sounded pretentious haha), vegas restaurants don't automatically knock your socks off.  there are lots of great chicago restaurants to compare (and several of them, like n9ne and japonais, also opened up shop in vegas).  eiffel tower definitely wasn't 5-star quality.  i would probably be even harder on it if i wasn't on an expense account.  but hey, it's vegas, so you are expected to pay a lot for everything, right? :)  the view , though, is very unique and adds to a fine dining experience.", 
            "went here for my girlfriend's birthday. i made reservations about a week ahead of time asking them for a fountain side seat. they told me they couldn't guarantee my seat and said i should come early.\n\ni recommend parking with the valet service at paris. either you or your date will be wearing something nice and heels so you probably won't want to walk in those. the self parking lot is pretty darn far away (about a 7 minute walk) so skimping on the valet tip isn't worth it. \n\nwe got the following: \n\n+pea soup (6.5/10) very distinct taste. came with some fish which was very delicious. \n+<mark>Muscovy Duck Breast, Camargue Rice, Pistachio, Sauce Foie Gras</mark> (7/10) portion was very small but delicious. it was very flavorful but a bit on the salty side. \n+blue cheese souffle (7/10) delicious. the souffle was scrumptious. \n+lamb chops (9/10) m girlfriend said this is the best lamp she's ever had. \n+chocolate souffle (9/10) very delicious and full of chocolate flavor. our server poked holes into the souffle and then pour chocolate syrup inside. \n+espresso\n\nour total came out to $132.42. a great deal for a good view, fine dining and a relaxing atmosphere. \n\ni'd have to say the lamb was very delicious. my girlfriend said that it was the best lamb she's ever had. i thought it was pretty good myself. it was flavorful and not very gamy.  i read a few other reviews commenting that the lamb was a bit tough. my girlfriend and i like our meat rare so i asked the waiter to serve it as rare as they could get away with. \n\nthe blue cheese souffle was pretty good but not as good as the chocolate souffle. we ordered it early so we'd get it after our lamb chops. \n\nthe entire dinner was roughly 2 hours. i'd give yourself 2 hours if in case you're budgeting your time. we had a cirque du soliel to run to so we paced ourselves to leave in 1 hour and 45 minutes. \n\nwe sat at the very corner seat closest to the bellagio fountains. we are from 700-900 and saw at least 5 fountain shows. i think this place has the best fountain shows. i'd definitely recommend this place for special occasions.",

            "the main reason i came to eat here was for the view. and it was the best part. all tables get a view of the bellagio's water fountain, although not every table has the best view. it felt awkward to take pictures inside the restaurant, but my family had no problem flashing away at everything.\n\nnow the food and cocktails. cocktails were upwards of $16. we had the pimm's cup, red velvet, and sparkling passion. all of them were extremely good and perfectly mixed. we ordered the warm <mark>Muscovy Duck Breast, Camargue Rice, Pistachio, Sauce Foie Gras</mark> to start. it's so tiny the four slices of pear that accompany it was a bigger portion. but it was smooth and melt in your mouth. definitely not worth the price. next to come out was the veal medallions. this is a must get; it was delicious. we had it come out with the appetizers.\n\nnow for the entrees:\nthey ran out of black cod, by the time we got there, so we got the sea bass. it was good, a might order again.\nthe cured duck breast was not that great. i like fatty chinese roasted duck much better, a definite will not order again.\nrack of lamb was perfect; cooked to perfection and tasted so tender, will order again.\nwe had two <mark>Prime Aged New York Steak</mark>, both ordered medium rare, but one came out a little drier. it is also a will order again. i regret not ordering a surf and turf instead of the second ny steak.\n\nto finish off, we had ordered two souffles when told they need to be ordered in advanced. not sure if we ate too quickly, but we waited a good fifteen minutes between the entrees and dessert. but then they came, one chocolate souffle, and the other waiter-recommended grand marnier souffle. both were great, but definitely the grand marnier souffle was the best, will come just for this!\n\nin all, the food was great. not sure i would come back because it didn't seem like the food was worth the price. next time, i'll just stick at the bar for the view.", 
            "i have two sets of comments here, one for the general public, and the other for the truly discriminating foodie.\n\nfirst, if you're looking for a lovely dining experience, you won't be disappointed.  everything that came out of the kitchen was presented beautifully, the pacing was good, the ambiance, lovely.  probably 'nuff said here, but if you're a foodie, read on.\n\ni have to lead with the wired, secret service earpieces the waitstaff sported.  as you exit the elevator, you're facing the state of the art kitchen, and beehive efficient staff.  if you have lead time on your reservation, do request a table overlooking the bellagio's fountains.  it's a mesmerizing view.  casual diners, stop here.  foodies, read on.\n\nnow for the prix fixe.  98 pp for the meal, an additional 69 pp for the wine pairings, and if you're dining as a couple, you will both need to opt in. \n\nthe amuse bouche was the prelude, and consisted of an onion vichyssoise with a white fish top that was divine.  after this there were three petits of smoked salmon, <mark>Muscovy Duck Breast, Camargue Rice, Pistachio, Sauce Foie Gras</mark>, <mark>Gratinee Creamed Spinach and Mushroom</mark> streudel.  the <mark>Muscovy Duck Breast, Camargue Rice, Pistachio, Sauce Foie Gras</mark> was served atop an almost meringue-light crouton, but it was still too much bread to balance the <mark>Muscovy Duck Breast, Camargue Rice, Pistachio, Sauce Foie Gras</mark>. \n\nfrom there off to the first course - a lobster salad over cucumber papaya relish, paired with a feuillatte blush champagne.  this is, of course, where my palate first deviates from the sommelier's, as i didn't find the blush, well, necessary.  i would have been perhaps happier with a light champagne or chardonnay/chablis sparkling.  lobster, in my opinion, should always be the star of the show. \n\nthe next course was the butternut squash bisque, and that pairing was literally too close for comfort.  no, really, the pinot gris was astoundingly similar to the soup.  in this case, i would have looked for a little more contrast.  the soup was quite wonderful.\n\nsea bass was served next, over a bed of smoky tomato quinoa that was nothing short of brilliant (the quinoa; not the bass, which i actually found a little leathery and over-done.)  a quintessentially russian river chardonnay was served; i would have gone for something un-oaked and less buttery.\n\ni love it when a restaurant *knows* how the beef should be cooked; just a few degrees shy of medium rare.  paired with the perfect ferrari-carano blend, these tiny prime beef roulades were absolutely top-notch.  prime beef roulade, horseradish mousseline and a nod to brussels sprouts\n\ni can't comment on the dessert wine, as they are not to my taste, and beyond my scope. clos uroulat.\n\nwhat i can tell you is to scratch the apple streudel with cinnamon ice cream right off your list of considerations - the pastry was tough enough to need a knife, and the filling, totally forgettable.  way too heavy-handed on the raw sugar as well.   by contrast, however, the white chocolate banana elysium (i believe they called it), was a work of art (photo attached).\n\nif you got to the end of this whole review, without thinking i'm  certifiable, you better link to me.  i want to read your reviews, too.\n\noverall, the restaurant experience was excellent, and someplace i could recommend without hesitation.\n\nbon appetit!", 
            "i am a huge fan of <mark>Muscovy Duck Breast, Camargue Rice, Pistachio, Sauce Foie Gras</mark> and they have it both warm and cold . i must admit both were fantastic . i had the fish and it was great delicate and delightful . my friend had the steak and said it was very good . i also recommend the oysters", 
            "we were fortunate to be seated, at the late hour of 9pm, right in front of the windows overlooking the beautiful bellagio fountains.  \n\nthe dining room was quite elegant, with the lights lowered making for a very intimate atmosphere.  the tables are also set pretty close together, meaning you are sitting quite close to your neighboring diners.  i tried <mark>Muscovy Duck Breast, Camargue Rice, Pistachio, Sauce Foie Gras</mark> for the first time, and thought i'd died and gone to heaven.  though very pricey, our dinners were delicious - very high quality food.  service was impeccable, rounding out a lovely night out.\n\nbe sure to splurge on one of their souffl\\u00e9s!",

            "a girlfriend and i came in for lunch on saturday to take advantage of the prix fixe menu they offered in support of las vegas restaurant week. \n\ni loved the seating/reservations coordinator downstairs. she checked my name in the computer, confirmed to the restaurant upstairs that i was in the building, and led us into the elevator. it was, at once, very posh and attentive, but cool and casual and welcoming. definitely a good start.\n\nthe elevator opens up to the kitchen. a great touch; i love to see the kitchen and have a sense of what is going on with my food! walk to the right and you enter into the bar area and see the hostess desk. you also see that there really isn't a bad seat in the place. it is tiered so as to offer, as much as possible, a view to every diner. great idea. the decor is upscale and comfortable, simple and elegant without putting off the casual diner.\n\nwe were seated at an intimate two-person table on the window, facing the bellagio and fountains. c'est parfait! tres jolie! we loved the show against a somewhat dreary day in las vegas; the lights lit up the water and made the view (and by proxy the ambiance of the restaurant) that much more beautiful.\n\nservice was spectacular. everything was timed perfectly, from the amuse to the apps to the entrees to desserts. wine service was expedient and attentive. everything was explained well, if not a little too rehearsed; we heard the same spiel over and over, almost verbatim, to tables around us. hint: change it up a bit, add some personality and personability to it! still, friendly, capable, and humorous when appropriate, everyone was on their game.\n\nmmmmm, food. this *is* a restaurant, after all.\n\ndrinks: we opted for wine by the glass, but they did have some yum-sounding signature cocktails... for about $18 a piece. just not worth it to me... i can have three glasses of wine to your one cocktail and be happier for it. others around us were loving their drinks, and i see value in that on occasion, but it was something we skipped... this time.\n\namuse: a light but flavor-full mushroom flan with a small piece of mushroom on top. savory goodness in less than a bite and one of the best fungi preparations i have had the pleasure of eating in a long time.\n\napps: the <mark>Muscovy Duck Breast, Camargue Rice, Pistachio, Sauce Foie Gras</mark> (not on the lvrw menu, but ordered as an extra) was absolutely phenomenal. served cold, it was a large, thick slice straight off the liver. nothing formed or cubed or otherwise manipulated, it was marbled by veins and perfect. as if that's not amazing enough, it was wrapped in duck prosciutto. yeah, drool-worthy.\n\nthe spinach and grueyere streudel was good. i hoped for more cheese, and i found the crust to be a bit too hard. that said, the flavors were solid and the spinach was fresh. not a bad dish.\n\nentree: the flank steak had a great flavor and the cabernet jus was delicious. but there was something about how it was cut... almost against the grain? sadly, it was also a little tough. we ordered them medium rare (i even added \"more on the rare side\") and they were closer, i think, to medium. great flavors, but a little lost on execution.\n\ndessert: the peach tartin was fantastic. the pastry was light and crisp, the peaches were fresh, sweet and tender, and the basil ice cream with piece of crispy basil was a lovely, sweet and savory complement to the rest of the dish. really, really done well.\n\ni never felt rushed, the meal was very good and the prices were good. aside from the prix fixe decision we made, the <mark>Muscovy Duck Breast, Camargue Rice, Pistachio, Sauce Foie Gras</mark> was only $20 (and compared to other places i have been lately, that's an amazing deal for what they offer. definitely a fave!). with 2 glasses of wine each and all of the above, it was only $65 or so each before a tip. very much worth the visit!\n\nfor next time... i see wine and <mark>Muscovy Duck Breast, Camargue Rice, Pistachio, Sauce Foie Gras</mark> and dessert at the bar. casual yet still surrounded by the intimate elegance... and with a fabulous view.",

            "one of my top ten restaurant experiences of all time.  really spectacular service.  outstanding food.  an amazing view.  expensive (although not the most expensive meal i've ever eaten) and worth every damn penny.  \n\nyour experience starts off on the casino floor where you take a special elevator up to the restaurant.  the doors open and you are greeted by an adorable majordomo standing in front of the gleaming glass and chrome kitchen which is a positive beehive of activity. you round the corner into a cozy dark reception area with seating and a small bar area.  the couple next to us was eating at the bar so i supposed if you are too spontaneous to make a reservation you can still enjoy the restaurant.  our table was ready after about 10 minutes (we had a drink at the bar, which seems to be stocked with at least one bottle of every liqueur known to man, meticulously organized and labeled)\n\nwe had a window table with a great view of the fountains and strip.  service was flawless.   they select and train staff very well.  and the food....\n\nstarters\nme:   cold <mark>Muscovy Duck Breast, Camargue Rice, Pistachio, Sauce Foie Gras</mark>\nboyfriend:  warm <mark>Muscovy Duck Breast, Camargue Rice, Pistachio, Sauce Foie Gras</mark>\nset the standard for the dinner to come.  phenomenal.  \n\nmain\nme:  venison chop\nboyfriend:  rack of lamb\nside dish:  brussels sprouts\nas tender and amazing as the meat was on my chop, the star of the plate was the little oatmeal cake it was served with.  for many restaurants the starch is kind of an afterthought (\"umm, yeah let's throw some potatoes on here to take up space\").  i am still thinking about that sublime little round of deliciousness a month later.  \n\nto my absolute surprise we learned from the it is a lettuce entertain you restaurant from the lovely manager who visited our table and chatted with it.  i wholeheartedly recommend this as a great special event restaurant.  \n\nand please fellow yelpers, dress appropriately.  yes, it is vegas where you can wear a tee shirt and jeans 99% of the time, but this is the 1% of the time you shouldn't.  i know you'll argue that you are paying good money so why should you dress up for others but go ahead and wear those heels and dress shoes.  enjoy it.  savor the fanciness.   it is a special meal, so relax and enjoy it for what it is.  you deserve it, right?",

            "surprise dinner here for my bday. bf kept saying the food might not be great bc a lot of reviews only talk about the nice ambiance. we had dinner at the palm in caesar's the night before and it was disappointing. the eiffel tower made up for that. \n\nthe restaurant is romantic and nice with an awesome view of the strip and the bellagio water show. i had the lamb chops with <mark>Muscovy Duck Breast, Camargue Rice, Pistachio, Sauce Foie Gras</mark> $48. the bf had the duck breast $39. the side we chose was the potatoes croquette $10. the lamb chops was really good and tender but u only get 2. i guess i didn't pay attention to the dish description bc the <mark>Muscovy Duck Breast, Camargue Rice, Pistachio, Sauce Foie Gras</mark> is what makes it so expensive. i didn't know and tried it and then figured out what it was. so that was the only disappointment. rather would've had extra lamb instead. haha. the bf's duck breast was really yummy too. nice and tender and moist. the potato croquettes were ok. i'd choose another side next time. for dessert we had the chocolate souffle $15. when they bring it out the server makes a hole and drizzles in melted chocolate which makes it extra rich. i would have preferred to do that myself. the parts not drenched in melted chocolate was less sweet and tasted very light. i would ask them to not pour it in if you prefer it not be so sweet. \n\nin addition for my bday we got a small chocolate parfait with happy birthday on it which was very nice. and then they also bring out petit desserts to choose 1 to try. the service here is amazing. the atmosphere is awesome. there's also a photographer to take your pic with the paris sign in the background. it's $24 for a 5x7 and they also email you the pic to have as a digital copy and add to your phone pics. overall really like this place for a romantic dinner. it's super fancy but guys only need to wear a collared shirt. the hostesses wear long black gowns. and servers wear tuxedo like outfits bowtie and all.",

            "i had one of the best meals of my life here!\n\nthe eiffel tower restaurant is a treat!  as others have said there is a worry that this restaurant would be all about flash with no substance.\n\nit does have flash but it also has plenty of substance to offer.  while this is not perfect it is very, very good.  the service was impeccable from start to finish with the waiter and sommelier working very hard to get us exactly the meal we were looking for.  the restaurant is designed so the spectacular view is forefront and everything else compliments that.  it is slightly noisy but not overly loud.  this place has a happy energetic hum to it.  \n\nmany couples were seated directly facing the view away from the noise so i would still recommend this place for a top notch romantic atmosphere.\n\nwe were here from out of town to celebrate an event and made the lucky choice of dining here.\n\nwe came in just as the sun was setting and watched the strip transform around us, it was breathtaking.  but this place is about more than just a sensational view.\n\nthe restaurant opened with a free amuse bouches one which paired three flavors a salmon mousse, asparagus with a lemon foam and a bit of pastry and a wonderful lobster preparation, we argued over which was the best.\n\nwe started with caviar, a blue cheese souffle pudding with salad, the fricasse of escargot, sweetbreads and fennel and finally the <mark>Muscovy Duck Breast, Camargue Rice, Pistachio, Sauce Foie Gras</mark> with pears.\n\nthe caviar was served beautifully on square platforms with indentations for the caviar, creme fraiche and chives.  it was served with a metal spoon rather than a mother of pearl but that was the only flaw.  the caviar was wonderful tasting and all the various accompaniments flawless (there were both buckwheat and plain blini and toast points).\n\nthe <mark>Muscovy Duck Breast, Camargue Rice, Pistachio, Sauce Foie Gras</mark> was seared perfectly and came to the table at just the right temperature.  the accompanying pears in a sauternes sauce did not seem quite right as it needed more sweetness to contrast with the <mark>Muscovy Duck Breast, Camargue Rice, Pistachio, Sauce Foie Gras</mark>.\n\nthe fricasse was not as remarkable as i hope but it was a nicely balanced dish with a great contrast of textures and flavors, it seemed on the mild side for such an ambitious combination of elements but still very nicely done.\n\nthe blue cheese souffle pudding was incredible.  it was a sturdy souffle which did not fall when cut into but such a wonderful, flavor and it worked so well with the dressing on the greens.  just wonderful, absolutely the high point of our starters.\n\ni had the beef wellington which was perfectly tender and seasoned perfectly.  done just on the rare side of medium, it was heavenly. \n\nour table generally loved the potato croquettes but i was somewhat underwhelmed by them.  they seemed too simple and by the time i was passed them too cool and limp.\n\nfinally the desserts, there were many ordered and consumed at our table.  i remember the pistachio souffle as being dreamlike in its perfection of flavor and form, the other souffles were magnificent in their execution as well but the pistachio flavor just was so intriguing and well done.  the napoleon was lovely and just as delicate as one could wish and there was a wonderful chocolate plate that i was too full to touch but looked perfect.\n\ndespite the magnificence of the meal, i have a few concerns about this place.  it is on the pricey side for what you get.  i almost took off a star for the very few missteps during the meal, however the overall experience was so wonderful and the great times i have had stopping by for a drink and an appetizer on past trips to las vegas are also terrific, i have to give this my highest rating.", 
            "although quite expensive, the eiffel tower restaurant is a must see to anyone visiting las vegas on vacation. just make sure to request a window seat and you will have some of the best views of the strip around! accompanied by a lovely parisian ambiance and phenomenal food. the <mark>Muscovy Duck Breast, Camargue Rice, Pistachio, Sauce Foie Gras</mark> appetizers are to die for and i had the best lamb chops of my life there as well! my boyfriend got the chocolate tasting dessert, which was superb as well! the service was great, as to be expected at an authentic french restaurant. they were definitely a bit over the top but not too in your face. i've heard it's amazing for lunch as well. my table directly overlooked the bellagio fountains so we got to watch many, many shows! they were also very respectful of our schedule since we had theater that we needed to make it to.", 
            "woohoo! as good as it gets!\n\nto this establishment, first and foremost: thank you.  i had a special occasion that i wished to more than just celebrate -- i wanted to honor it.  through every aspect within their power, their execution was flawless.\n\nit all started with communicating my intentions to one of the managers, whose information i took from prior review responses.  i figured if someone cared enough to write back to people, they might be the right sort to handle my requests with care.  i couldn't have been more right.  laurent ertle is the man i owe the uncanny success of the following.\n\nthrough him, his suggestions, and his staff, when the night came, everything flowed effortlessly.  we pre-arranged the time and table to have, in my opinion, the best seats in the house.  the view and progression of the evening was marvelous.  a prepayment plan was set in place to avoid that awkward distraction at the end of the evening.  i was even granted the appropriate menus and floral piece for the table.\n\nafter the warm welcome to our seats, the evening began with a cocktail.  expressing an interest in st. germain, our server when to ask the bar on specialties.  what returned was their version of a french 75.  a delightfully fragrant, subtly sweet, and slightly strong drink -- the perfect definition of a cocktail.\n\nshortly thereafter, we were given a choice of bread to have.  while normally i would have picked a different bread to try each time around, i just couldn't get past having more of the wonderful french baguette -- rightfully so, considering the venue.  then we were given a sample of gazpacho.  it was creamy and smooth being watery in neither flavor nor texture.  thus it was obvious to me that the selection of vegetables, spices, and method was very deliberate.  to follow was an amuse bouche.  i had to ask the waiter twice what the trio was, and i still unfortunately forgot what they were exactly.  so instead of exact, i'll be broad: one was a fluffy, rich cheese-pastry; second was an oyster topped with caviar on a bed of black pepper and sea-salt; third was a mini quiche looking bite.  it succeeded in spurring my appetite for more.  for appetizers we ordered a corn soup and roasted <mark>Muscovy Duck Breast, Camargue Rice, Pistachio, Sauce Foie Gras</mark>.  the soup was the result of for some inexplicable reason that they don't serve french onion soup, which i would have considered a given.  simple and tasty the soup was with a good marrying of ripe corn and hints of bacon.  the <mark>Muscovy Duck Breast, Camargue Rice, Pistachio, Sauce Foie Gras</mark> was luxuriously rich, and smartly paired with grapes and crisps for palate contrast and cleansing.\n\nour main courses were the <mark>Prime Aged New York Steak</mark> and <mark>Broiled 22 oz. Bone-in Ribeye, Roasted Bone Marrow</mark> in a cabernet reduction as well as a beef wellington with <mark>Individual Eiffel Tower Beef Wellington, Sauteed Snap Peas</mark>.  i will say that my definition of medium-rare must differ from the kitchen's, but it's typically against my principles to argue with a chef's execution unless gross malpractice has occurred.  after just one bite, i forgot about any disagreement i might have had.  i was reminded that the quality of cut and preparation is at least as important as the method.  the marrow and reduction added a level of depth new to me with such a course.  the complex flavors still make me salivate at the mere memory of them.  the wellington was flawless in every way -- from presentation to indulgence.  the pastry shell advertised the culinary art contained.  it was flaky and refined.  inside was a wonderfully tender, and expertly cooked, cut of beef.  more-so this course, i very easily would recommend it to anyone.\n\ndesert was a pair of souffles, that have to be ordered at the very beginning due to their complexity.  we had a gran marnier and pistachio.  both light and delicious, which was the point of getting two.  i have to say i preferred the pistachio, but that is far from an easy decision to make -- i had to compare one to the other exhaustively.  the petit fours were simple treats of milk chocolate, fudge, white chocolate, or mango.  they definitely were unimpressive, but that's what happens when everything else was so far above standard.\n\ni had asked the photographer to return so that our photo would take place with the night lights of the bellagio fountains.  not only did she, but she was enough of a perfectionist to wait for the exact right moment of the fountain show to snap the moment.  she also had our finished photo to us in what seemed like no time at all.\n\na special note must be given to the server, mario.  not to be confused with the waiter (which for the first time for me, was not the same person).  he was an absolute pleasure to have around.  he was not only prompt and courteous in profession, but also charming and humorous in conversation.  it was the type of thing that beside all the foreign luxury we were surrounded in, there still was a sense of reality to ground the experience in memory instead of fantasy.\n\ni was denied the tower ride due to mother nature, but hopefully that will also encourage me to return again to at least shake laurent ertle's hand.", 
            "ou la la, tres magnifique! the view alone will swoon you.  the service is near perfect.  the food was elegant and tres delicieux!  you will walk away thoroughly satisfied.\n\nthe only complaint i could even mention is towards a patron who asked if this place served french cuisine.  get out of here! :-p  \n\nto get to the restaurant, you must walk through the casino floor and find the eiffel tower elevator.  a staff member will escort you and voila.\n\nthe service was magnifique from the start to the end.  as soon as you are seated you will be asked about beverage.  they will kindly recommend you some wine followed by a buffet of freshly made breads.  yes, buffet! we went through a few rounds of them.  you get your classic baguet and couple of other delicieux homemade breads!\n\nas the yelper i am, i had to take several pictures around the restaurant.  you could be seated anywhere and still have a spectacular view of the beautiful vegas strip and surrounding.  be sure to get a nice shot with the paris ballon in the background.\n\nthe food\n\nstarted off with a couple things actually.  first was this complimentary shot of something that reminded you of a bacon potato soup.  tres bon! second, was appetizer--a deliciously warm sweet glazed <mark>Muscovy Duck Breast, Camargue Rice, Pistachio, Sauce Foie Gras</mark>! \n\nfor the main course, i savored every single bite of my nicely medium grilled ny-cut steak with glistening <mark>Broiled 22 oz. Bone-in Ribeye, Roasted Bone Marrow</mark> accompanied with a side of pillowy soft mashed potatoes.  *food coma mode*\n\nlastly, the chocolate souffle! they served it by pouring warm, melting chocolate into the souffle.  it was very moist and soft with a balanced sweetness from the chocolate.\n\none thing i really appreciated was them filling your glass of water each time it was low.\n\nyou might not be in the real paris, but the experience here definitely made you feel like you were in the city of lights.  merci beaucoup eiffel tower restaurant for a magical and elegant evening.", 
            "i love this place. my husband and i visit every month or so for an amazing evening on the strip. the <mark>Muscovy Duck Breast, Camargue Rice, Pistachio, Sauce Foie Gras</mark> is seared perfect and always a generous portion is served. opt for the tasting menu with wine pairing. also this is the best souffle i've ever had - share a chocolate and pistachio with your date for the perfect end to a perfect meal! yum!", 
            "my wife and i made the trek to vegas for memorial day to celebrate an early anniversary.  initially we had reserved at picasso across at the bellagio, but with the heavy traffic we were forced to find other options.  we've been to vegas countless times so we finally decided to try the eiffel tower restaurant.  i have to say, it exceeded my expectations.  the dining room was a great rendition of those parisian brasseries.  although there were a few open seats that faced the window, the hostess could not accommodate us due to prior reservations.  we were pretty hungry so at that point, it wasn't worth the wait.  \n\nas it turns out, this was a bit of a serendipitous turn as we were waited on by one of the best waiters i've experienced in quite a while in rodney.  from listening to our tastes, he was able to recommend us two delicious red wines that paired perfectly with the dinner selection that we chose. \n\nbefore we even started, we were served a nice amuse bouche of chilled avocado puree.  it was a nice palate cleanser and a welcome bite after such a long drive in.\n\nwanting to maintain that french theme, we chose the fricassee of wild escargot, potato, sweet garlic souffle and the roasted <mark>Muscovy Duck Breast, Camargue Rice, Pistachio, Sauce Foie Gras</mark>, rhubarb compote, alsace spice croutons for appetizers.  both were quite tasty with a nice balance of flavors.  the <mark>Muscovy Duck Breast, Camargue Rice, Pistachio, Sauce Foie Gras</mark> had a great compote that offset the richness of the <mark>Muscovy Duck Breast, Camargue Rice, Pistachio, Sauce Foie Gras</mark> itself.  escargot is definitely an acquired taste, but that said, the fricassee was equally delicious over the bed of potato.\n\nin between, rodney continually checked on us and talked with us like old friends that haven't seen each other for a long time.  \n\nthe main course itself, we chose the <mark>Muscovy Duck Breast, Camargue Rice, Pistachio, Sauce Foie Gras</mark> and the boneless farm raised rabbit, braised carrots confits, mustard jus.  just delicious.  i looked for both of these entrees in paris last fall and to my surprise, i just had to come to vegas for some real french food.  the duck was perfectly cooked and the rice had a very pleasant hint of orange folded with it.  the rabbit itself was slightly crispy on the outside and the meat itself was quite tender.  (those who have never had rabbit before, it tastes like chicken mostly but it does have another unique flavor to it)  in addition we decided to supplement with the potato croquettes and the gratin\\u00e9e <mark>Gratinee Creamed Spinach and Mushroom</mark>.  (we also learned from one of the french staff that croquettes are not french).  amazing.  slightly crispy on the outside and the middle is similar to a mashed potato texture, its something i haven't had before.  the only minus points were the creamed spinach was a little too oily for my liking.\n\nsave room for the souffle.  its a can't miss.  we chose the pistachio (btw, i love all things pistachio - macaroons, froyo, etc.) but i can imagine the other flavors being just as good.  the dessert itself is quite light and the souffle itself has a texture similar to sponge cake.\n\nafterwards, rodney surprised us with a plate commemorating our 2nd anniversary with a chocolate mousse in the center.  at that point, i was quite full, but i did manage to get a small taste of it.  as with the rest of the meal, delicious.\n\nin closing, as someone who visits vegas on a consistent basis, i look forward to celebrating our future events at the eiffel tower restaurant and would recommend others as well to experience the authentic french food and delicious desserts.", 
            "i can't even begin to describe how wonderful my experience was at this restaurant. i've been to paris, and i've been to the top of eiffel tower, and although it is not the same spiritual experience i felt in france, it was still wonderful. my bf told me he got the recommendation from a guy he was sharing a poker table with as they were discussing french food. the guy told him he has taken his wife here every year for their anniversary. and let's just say after eating here, i really had to go back and re-evaluate all the 5-star places i've reviewed. i would never take back a star or anything but every venue after this has a standard to meet. lol.\n\nvenue: \nthe restaurant is at the top of paris hotel and casino, with amazing ceiling-to-floor windows that allow you to have a view overlooking the strip. we were taken up via elevator and once you first enter you pass the kitchen - all white tile, very french-looking kitchen. a bit tacky i thought at first, but on my way out, i realized how clever they were in doing that (it was probably unintentional but whatever), because as soon as you enter the dining area you are floored. the atmosphere is romantic and intimate. perfect place in vegas date night/dinner so make sure you take someone on whom, you find worth spending the money. go during the evening - after 8 pm when the bellagio does its fountain shows every 15 minutes you'll enjoy the view. overall we spend ~$250. worth every penny...that the bf spent. \n\nfood/drink:\ndrinks:\ni started off my evening with the house bordeaux. now, i'm not a sommelier and i don't think myself a vino or anything, but i thought this red was delicious. the server told me it would be dry, but i didn't find that to be the case at all. when i think of dry i think of merlots but this was fantastic. the bf got their (the name escapes me) drink with the raspberries, blackberries, and blueberries in it. it was delicious and is served with a spoon so you don't have to worry trying to tilt the glass upward at the end to get the fruit.\n\nappetizers:\nroasted <mark>Muscovy Duck Breast, Camargue Rice, Pistachio, Sauce Foie Gras</mark>, marinated grapes, julienne cr\\u00eapes: oh my goodness. for such a tiny portion, it sure packed a punch. it was phenomenal. the pate melted in my mouth and also went well with the bread that served.\n\nrack of lamb, served medium: oh lawd. delicious. tender, juicy meat that literally fell off the bone once you put your fork in it. \nbeef wellington, served medium rare: let me tell you, i've had some pretty darn good beef wellington in my life and this was scrumptious. the beef was also tender and juicy and the pate surrounding it was a great seletion. \ndessert:\n\nstrawberry souffle. i can't even. it wasn't super sugary sweet which i loved. the flavors of the strawberry really came out, and eventhough i was stuffed by the time dessert came out, i didn't feel guilty eating the souffl\\u00e9 at all. the texture was marshmellowy but didn't feel heavy at all. it was amazing.\n\nservice:\nwe were orginially sat at a table to the side of the restaurant but wanted a better view of the bellagio (who wouldn't?) and asked to be moved. the hostess was accomodatnig and understanding and were re-sat in a matter of 5 minutes. not bad for a 7pm, saturday night reservation. we sprung for the photo - and although i feel bad for the other yelpers that got blurry ones, ours came out really well. and being a photo whore, the photogapher let me review what she had taken and took a few to make sure i was satisfied. our server was funny and helpful and courteous. he made sure to ask us about dessert before our entrees came out - which was mindful since we had a 9:30pm show to catch. we took our time and paid with minutes to spare as we walked to the monte carlo afterwards.", 
            "my husband and i came here after we eloped back in november. i'm not sure if it was the high <mark>Napoleon of Rabbit Loin, Braised Leek, Fava Beans, Natural Jus</mark> getting married (and the bottle of champagne we had before), but this place was perfect.\nwe tried to eat at the steakhouse at the cosmopolitan, but it was packed and the music was so loud we couldn't hear each other talk. \nso we went over to paris and we didn't have to wait long. the service was awful. pretentious (though not shocking) and stuck up. we wanted to sit by the window, but they said it was reserved. there were four empty table by the window, none of which filled up the whole time we were dining.\n\nnonetheless, we didn't let it kill the mood. we ordered a delicious bottle of pinot noir (i forget which) and ordered the blue cheese souffle. it was awesome. so light, yet incredibly flavorful at the same time. \n\ndinner: i had the ny steak with cranberry/<mark>Broiled 22 oz. Bone-in Ribeye, Roasted Bone Marrow</mark> sauce on top. seriously the best steak i've ever eaten in my life. it may have been the best meal i've ever had in my life. it was juicy and flavorful, perfectly cooked. my husband had a <mark>'The King' <mark>'The Queen' Broiled Beef Tenderloin Filet Mignon</mark></mark> with <mark>Muscovy Duck Breast, Camargue Rice, Pistachio, Sauce Foie Gras</mark> w/truffle oil. he raved about his meal too (i thought mine was better though).\n\nall in all, the service got a dismal tip (my husband wrote a note on the receipt) but the meal was amazing and memorable!", 
            "service at this restaurant is excellent. our friends who were meeting us were running late but the hostess was nice enough to seat us anyway. so we decided to order drinks. i had some watermelon drink and then a pi\\u00f1a colada. i get really giddy when i drink so everything was funny to me. this restaurant is super romantic and dark with a beautiful view. i ordered the <mark>Muscovy Duck Breast, Camargue Rice, Pistachio, Sauce Foie Gras</mark>, corn soup and duck. i always enjoy <mark>Muscovy Duck Breast, Camargue Rice, Pistachio, Sauce Foie Gras</mark> but it was a tiny piece. the corn soup had crab in it and was really sweet. by the time the duck came i was already full. it was a bit dry and i didn't like the rice that came with it. my hubby had the caesar salad, <mark>Muscovy Duck Breast, Camargue Rice, Pistachio, Sauce Foie Gras</mark> and beef wellington. his wellington was excellent. the flaky crust to it was so buttery and crispy. we shared the strawberry souffl\\u00e9 for dessert. and they even gave us a free chocolate mousse with happy anniversary written on it. my friends both enjoyed their dinners and treated us for our anniversary. it was a nice time but food comes out very slow.", 
            "so this review is a tad late, but still holds true i'm sure. the meal i had here was hands down one of the best, if not maybe even the best (or maybe i'm just saying this cause i can't afford to eat like this anymore since i moved to europe) meal i've ever had. you can't get <mark>Muscovy Duck Breast, Camargue Rice, Pistachio, Sauce Foie Gras</mark> in california anymore, so of course i had to go with the legit tournedo rossini, which was pretty much, and i don't know if i've ever used this word in a review, probably not on yelp at any rate, orgasmic. yes, orgasmic people, i said it. it was melt in your mouth, and the textures and the flavors, me oh my. the <mark>Muscovy Duck Breast, Camargue Rice, Pistachio, Sauce Foie Gras</mark> was velvety and a great contrast to the tenderness of the filet. i don't think i even used a knife, didn't have to, i kind <mark>Napoleon of Rabbit Loin, Braised Leek, Fava Beans, Natural Jus</mark> sliced through with my fork because it was like butter.\n\ni also splurged, cause i like to go big on vacation and this was one of my last meals in the states, on the raw seafood platter. yes it will break the bank, but again, so fresh and so clean. the lobster tail, crab legs, oysters and mussels, basically tasted like they had just been caught and brought to your table in under an hour, which we all know in the middle of the desert, wouldn't be possible, but my taste buds enjoyed thinking that it was. \n\nvery pricey, but you know what they say in vegas (well other than the thing about blackmail fodder staying there, cause with facebook i think they had to scrap that particular ad campaign) go big or go home!", 
            "some people are just so nonsensical. usually i find it difficult to give 5 stars to a business that keeps their prices out of reach for middleclassmen like myself but it would seem almost criminal to do so in this case. the service was so superb and outstanding i felt like i left w a new group of friends that i will visit every 3-4 yrs from here out. the view of the strip and the fountain show is unparalleled and the food is better. you like <mark>Muscovy Duck Breast, Camargue Rice, Pistachio, Sauce Foie Gras</mark>??? how about 4 different options?!! souffl\\u00e9? taste the rainbow, they have six different flavors!", 
            "out of all the meals that i had here in vegas this was my favorite, it was my first time eating in a french restaurant. we were gonna dine at one of the most fanciest places in all of las vegas, it was me, my dad, mike and his wife martha, joe and his wife deb (joe treated everyone to dinner) and paul and his wife linda (a table of 8). located on the 11th floor of the paris, we took the elevator up and when we walked in we saw the kitchen staff hard at work preparing dinner then we saw this big extraordinary, elegant room and you get a nice view overlooking the bellagio fountains outside. \nwe sat down and while making our decisions for appetizers were treated to a lovely amuse-bouche (french for amusing the mouth, to wake up your palate, with a bite-sized appetizer) it was a shot glass filled with <mark><mark>Lemon Parsley Butter, Bearnaise, Bordelaise, Green Peppercorn, Black Truffle</mark>, Stone Ground Corn, Celery Root</mark> mousseline (mousseline is a creamy soup-like sauce when you fold whipped cream into hollandaise) it was topped with some chopped celery for some texture (a nice way to start the meal and to wake up the palate). for my appetizer i got the new york state <mark>Muscovy Duck Breast, Camargue Rice, Pistachio, Sauce Foie Gras</mark> which was sitting on a crispy alsace spice cake with quince compote and petite mache (<mark>Muscovy Duck Breast, Camargue Rice, Pistachio, Sauce Foie Gras</mark>, which is what i call meaty butter, melts in your mouth, quince a tart fruit, similar to a pear in appearance but has the similar taste and texture to an apple, spice cake was a nice crunchy little wafer spiced with cinnamon and mache a leafy green that has a nutty flavor, it was awesome). \n\nmy dad got the lobster bisque with lobster flan, celery and a brioche crouton (rich, smooth creamy soup with a flan in the center made from lobster stock, you get some crunch from the celery, and then you take a bite of that crispy brioche crouton, its spectacular). everyone else at the shared 2 different salads, the 1st one was a tuscan kale salad, door county dried cherries, cherry tomatoes, quinoa croutons, toasted pecans and finished with a balsamic vinaigrette (so much going on in that salad, crisp, earthy kale, sweetness from the cherries, tartness from the cherry tomatoes, you get crunch from both the croutons and pecans and you get acidity from the vinaigrette). the 2nd one was a non-traditional caesar salad with a dressing made from anchovies, capers and garlic (i honestly don't know what was non-traditional about that salad and i thought the dressing was a tad bit too salty for my taste). \nfor our drinks, while everyone else was mostly having red wine or chardonnay, me and martha partook in one of their signature cocktails: the eiffel affair (consisting of blueberry vodka, cr\\u00e8me de cassis, cointreau, rose nectar, some champagne for that fizzy and bubbly effect and topped off with some fresh berries). \nfor our entrees: i had the rabbit with braised carrots confit and mustard jus (my first time eating rabbit, so moist and tender like chicken, bite from the carrots and sweetness from the mustard jus, they use dijon mustard). my dad and paul had the pan seared pork chop with spiced braised apples and with a calvados sauce (juicy pork, the apples go so well with pork and the calvados sauce was sweet tasting, calvados is an apple brandy), mike got the roasted rack of lamb with tomato tart and <mark>Roasted Rack of Lamb, Tomato Tart, Tarragon Jus</mark> (the bones were beautifully frenched ), martha got the red snapper with razor clams, fingerling potatoes, tomato confit and finished with a shellfish bouillon (the fish had a nice crispy skin), deb and linda had the roasted chicken with apricot, quinoa pilaf and moroccan spices (i love roasted chicken, so flavorful). joe got the char <mark>'The King' <mark>'The Queen' Broiled Beef Tenderloin Filet Mignon</mark></mark> with a <mark>Rossini Style <mark>'The King' <mark>'The Queen' Broiled Beef Tenderloin Filet Mignon</mark></mark>, Foie Gras, Truffle Sauce</mark> (his was the most expensive).\n then we ordered dessert: i got the white chocolate banana elysee (it was named after a building in france, it was sliced bananas and white chocolate disks stacked on top of each other surrounded by a moat of a chocolate/vanilla sauce mixture and at the top there be a little ball made of caramelized sugar, normally i don't eat bananas but this was so damn good, it was the most stunning dessert i've ever eaten, it looked like a spaceship and boy did i take it to my leader, my stomach), mike and martha got the chocolate hazelnut a la parisienne with vanilla ice cream (it resembled a bear claw, mike and martha seemed to enjoy, but i thought it was bitter and after 2 bites i couldn't take anymore), joe and deb got the raspberry napoleon with a vanilla blanc manger and red fruit sorbet (stacked beautifully) and paul and linda got the classic cr\\u00e8me brulee (a bit of a clich\\u00e9). \n\neverything was amazing, but i had to delete the pictures that i took here due to the flash on my camera not working so after calling the restaurant a couple times (10) linda (one of the hostesses) and sharon (one of the general managers) were kind enough to help me out and to email me the pictures. also more thing my dad says you should adjust the lighting cuz it was very dim to him. i really had a nice time here, i'll be sure to come here again the next time i'm in vegas !!!", 
            "come for the view, maybe leave without food! at least this was my last experience with the eiffel tower restaurant. \n\ni have been in to eat 3 times now. the first 2 times were wonderful; 4 stars. this last time however was an abysmal 1 star.\n\nfirst of all, the view of the bellagio and their stunning fountain is fantastic. romantic, breathtaking and all other adjectives found in thesaurus. the staff is 5 stars all the way; from the helpful hostesses to the swift bread guy that is at your table though out your entire meal making sure you have a new, fresh piece of bread from the 5 different varieties in the basket.  amazing! kudos to him. the wait staff is all uniformly good as well - although at one point i finished my glass of wine and instead of refilling it from the bottle at the table, my waitress snatched it away leaving me wine free. i had to flag someone down to get me a fresh glass! and this is in vegas! humph, not impressed. \n\nnow, on to the food: my very first time in i ordered the seafood tower - go big or go home, right? it was crazy expense and worth every penny. it was fresh, tasty, totally over the top with how gigantic it was and resulted in a story to be told for years. my second time in was for a family meal. we went traditional with fish or steak entrees; the decadent bacon brussel sprouts on the side as well as potatoes. this meal had nothing negative to comment on.  overpriced but when you factor in the view, worth it for sure. now my most recent visit: i decided to really see what the menu was like away from the tried and true entrees. so, i started with lobster bouillon soup with lobster flan, celery and toasted brioche. the soup was creamy, very rich and the brioche was perfect to dip in.  the flan however was like an orange, wiggly, tasteless blob... like, crazy tasteless. next i had the worst, over vinegary, kale salad ever. and i love balsamic vinegar, i even drizzle it on ice cream! this salad was horrible, oh, and had 3 tiny cherries.... thanks, wouldn't want to over cherry, you might take away from the all the vinegar.   \n\nfinally, i was so excited to have the <mark>Muscovy Duck Breast, Camargue Rice, Pistachio, Sauce Foie Gras</mark> torchon with duck prosciutto and <mark>Cold <mark>Muscovy Duck Breast, Camargue Rice, Pistachio, Sauce Foie Gras</mark> Torchon, Duck Prosciutto, Fig Compote</mark>. the foie was slimy on top and congealed so it was hard to break through, i had to use a knife to cut it!  also didn't have that amazing buttery, melt in your mouth quality; it actually didn't taste much at all. i have never seen or tasted foie like this - i know canada is lucky that we have free-range farms and ability to produce amazing, sinfully delicious tasting foie. this was just disappointing and sad. hands down the worst foie i have ever had.  oh, and the duck prosciutto was as hard as glass. it actually cut my gum open when i tried to chew it. \n\ni would have had dessert but my mouth was bleeding from the duck glass. \n\nle repas \\u00e9tait horrible!", 
            "the dinner seating and view was fabulous. however, i think the menu is a little pricey.\n\n* saut\\u00e9ed loup de mer, barigoule, braised <mark>Baked Herbed Crepes, Artichoke, Slow Roasted Tomato Coulis, Basil Pistou</mark> $54 (4 of 5) tasty sea bass without bones. this was a tasty piece of white fish and i really enjoyed the braised artichoke.  \n* saut\\u00e9ed new york state <mark>Muscovy Duck Breast, Camargue Rice, Pistachio, Sauce Foie Gras</mark>, slow braised pineapple, alsace spice cake $28 (3.5 of 5) i really enjoyed the seared <mark>Muscovy Duck Breast, Camargue Rice, Pistachio, Sauce Foie Gras</mark> and braised pineapple, but i didn't think the spice cake complimenting the dish. i didn't think the texture of flavor complimented the dish. \n\noverall, this place is beautiful and spectacular views, but to be price conscience, i will just go back for drinks and dessert.",

            "i don't know where to start! my girlfriend and i were in vegas attending the electric daisy carnival which coincided with our 2 year anniversary. immediately we started looking for the finest restaurants las vegas boulevard had to offer. we tossed around ideas, and drew up a list. the eiffel tower restaurant had  fantastic price point that didn't degrade service or quality. of course we dressed up for the occasion, however i did note that some patrons where wearing beach shorts and t-shirts. not really the kind of ambiance i'd like when spending around $400 including tip. but alas i dined like royalty and enjoyed my stay. i started off with the <mark>Heirloom Tomato, California Burrata, Balsamic Aspic, Basil, Extra Virgin Olive Oil</mark> salad. it was beyond words and more than just a salad. the flavors that my palate were introduced to were unbelievable. my lovely girlfriend went with the warm maine lobster, white wine braised baby leeks, mustard vinaigrette  that was sublime. tender, succulent and bursting with flavor. a light size portion that is more about taste and saving room for the next course. for my entree i went with the char <mark>'The King' <mark>'The Queen' Broiled Beef Tenderloin Filet Mignon</mark></mark>, rossini style, <mark>Muscovy Duck Breast, Camargue Rice, Pistachio, Sauce Foie Gras</mark>, <mark>Rossini Style <mark>'The King' <mark>'The Queen' Broiled Beef Tenderloin Filet Mignon</mark></mark>, Foie Gras, Truffle Sauce</mark>. one of the best meals i've ever had the privilege to enjoy. definitely worth the $79 it was priced at. ill include a picture of this wonderful bit of paradise. i was hesitant to try <mark>Muscovy Duck Breast, Camargue Rice, Pistachio, Sauce Foie Gras</mark> but my curiosity was rewarded with an delicacy  that is no longer available in los angeles. it was cooked to perfection and looked as immaculate as it was delectable. my girlfriend had the prime aged bone-in ribeye, caramelized onions and added the black <mark>Rossini Style <mark>'The King' <mark>'The Queen' Broiled Beef Tenderloin Filet Mignon</mark></mark>, Foie Gras, Truffle Sauce</mark> that complimented it exquisitely. a magnificent slab of meat suitable for a king or queen in this case. bought some cocktails that seemed overpriced but the craftsmanship put into concocting them is well worth the steep price. the servers go out the way to make you feel comfortable, and for the time that you are there like you were as important as the president. never did i feel hovered over or stared at as if i didn't belong. my visit was a little less than a year ago and to this day 4/23/2014 i am still raving about it. we are going back to edc las vegas this year and are struggling to find another restaurant to match the eiffel tower restaurant. and the killer view of the fountains and strip is more romantic than can be described. definitely a meal that will stand out for a long time. adieu!", 
            "we don't get the hype.  really.  we have some experience with fine dining and it did not blow us out of the water.  maybe our expectations were high because it was recommended.  maybe we're getting snobby.  who knows?!  yeah, the service was good, the food good, the view nice, but for $400 for 2 (with tip)--- you expect that at the very least.  but to end on a positive note, my highlight was the <mark>Muscovy Duck Breast, Camargue Rice, Pistachio, Sauce Foie Gras</mark> on my <mark>'The King' <mark>'The Queen' Broiled Beef Tenderloin Filet Mignon</mark></mark> and my hubby loved his chocolate souffle.", 
            "the skinny: come here for the view - not for the food (2.5)service: solid but not high end restaurant level (3) value: overpriced for the cuisine but a great view of the bellagio fountains (2.5 starred review bump up to 3 stars).\n\nwe came for the brunch menu last weekend after receiving our annual coupons from lettuce entertain you.\n\nwe went in to try their brunch prix fixe and also to try a few a la carte items.\n\nafter making an open table reservation, we choose the earliest seating at 11 am. despite arriving at the hostess area at 11 am, we were asked to sit in a small area for a while as they set up our table. they seated us with a nice view of the bellagio fountains.\n\noverall the cuisine sounds very elegant but in reality, it's just subpar french bistro cuisine with better plating. i get to that again in a moment.\n\nwe chose the brunch prix fixe menu - the mushroom strudel appetizer, the steak and eggs, and the \"frozen\" strawberry souffle for $39. we chose the <mark>Muscovy Duck Breast, Camargue Rice, Pistachio, Sauce Foie Gras</mark> tourchon appy and the curry chicken pie entree as well.\n\nwe were treated to two slice of baguette with some butter to start. the bread was warm but other than that, nothing special. really, it's the same thing that likely gets served at mon ami gabi. this is in stark contrast to when they used to serve warm cheese gourgeres.\n\namuse was a zucchini parfait. the zucchini parfait itself was good however it unfortunately was served with these odd pastry sticks which were hard yet not crispy, chewy and flavorless. it really detracted from the zucchini parfait itself. a bad plating decision that pops up again and again throughout the meal.\n\nthe mushroom strudel was kind of strange. made of filo pastry, it's mostly made out of spinach rather than mushrooms. the spinach was surprisingly bland and you couldn't really taste the mushrooms due to the lack there of.  at least the parmesean cheese sprinkled above and below the filo pastry crust imparted a bit of umami to the dish but otherwise i can't recommend ordering this dish.\n\nthe <mark>Muscovy Duck Breast, Camargue Rice, Pistachio, Sauce Foie Gras</mark> tourchon was a disappointment - it wasn't nearly as luscious as i expected. served with some brioche toast, the <mark>Cold <mark>Muscovy Duck Breast, Camargue Rice, Pistachio, Sauce Foie Gras</mark> Torchon, Duck Prosciutto, Fig Compote</mark> had a odd kind of fermented flavor to it as well as being too thick to be spread easily. decidedly meh and i wouldn't recommend it.\n\nfrom the starters to the entrees, there was a good 30 minute wait between. luckily the view was nice so we didn't mind as much but there is obvious a timing issues in the kitchen.\n\nsteak and eggs were ordered medium rare and came out medium-well. i'm not one to send stuff back usually. plus given the long wait between the dishes, i just went with the flow. the quality of the steak was good and the meat was tender. the potatoes and red pepper hash underneath was delicious. unfortunately the blanched spinach was unseasoned and therefore completely bland which diluted the flavors of the dish. it was okay, but once was enough.\n\nchicken curry pot pie was essentially a version of chicken tikka masala baked under a puff pastry crust. the filling was underwhelming and slightly overly acidic. it really needed something to mellow the flavor out a bit. it was also missing a bit of that smokiness from real chicken tikka. it definitely need some dried fenugreek leaves to give it a more authentic flavor. i don't think i would recommend ordering this.\n\nwe split their \"frozen\" strawberry souffle. i kind of had a beef with that. call a spade a spade - it's just ice cream molded into a ramekin to look like souffle. word.\n\nanyway, the ramekin ice cream block with sprinkled pistachio was alright. in my honest opinion, i got more enjoyment from a grocery store purchased ice cream than this stuff.  the strawberry ice cream was overly firm and had a weird cool whip consistency when melted slightly. this contrasted to the more icy texture of the grand marnier ice cream on the bottom. this was a grade d in the level of desserts. it was okay because it was a part of the prix fixe but i would have been down right pissed if i'd ordered a la carte. save your pennies and head over to a half decent gelati joint and be way more happy.\n\nat the end you get some chocolates (tastes like cadbury chocolates and certainly nothing really special) and some fruit flavored jellies.\n\nservice, in general is good. water glasses were filled through out the meal and food was served promptly and at the proper temperatures. our waiter was courteous and helpful. however it was missing the small attention to detail that differentiates a truly high end restaurant (such as - describing your dishes in detail, removing the wine glasses as soon as they know you're not going to order wine... stuff like that).\n\nthis joint exemplifies the rule for \"view\" restaurants: the quality of the food is inversely proportional to the view. added the price premium for the location, i would not recommend this place as a top choice for a romantic dinner for 2. 2.5 starred review with a bump up to a 3 starred review.", 
            "this was our 3rd visit here.  \n\non our first visit, my wife and i had ordered the dinner tasting menu.  it was a 5 course meal in which we paired with a bottle of wine.  the view was amazing as we were sat right next to the window.  unfortunately, the food was very forgettable and nothing impressed us....

            "taking into account the service, quality of food, price, and the unparalleled views, i highly recommending coming to the eiffel tower restaurant for a special dinner date. \n\ni brought my bf here for his bday weekend and our first meal off the plane at 10pm was at the eiffel tower restaurant. while everybody raves about their views, i think they are seriously underrated for their food. every single dish that we ordered was amazing. our waiter was ridiculously attentive without being in your face. the entire restaurant gets gorgeous fountain views at the perfect height. if you make a reservation for 2, they tend to seat you at the window at these cute couple tables where you both sit face next to each other and enjoy the strip view. \n\nwe ordered about 6/7 dishes, including a lobster corn chowder with crab flan (huge chunks <mark>Napoleon of Rabbit Loin, Braised Leek, Fava Beans, Natural Jus</mark> lobster scattered throughout a creamy corn chowder, embellished with a chunk of crab flan), <mark>Muscovy Duck Breast, Camargue Rice, Pistachio, Sauce Foie Gras</mark> and warm pear appetizer, the beef wellington (huge portions and unlike anything i've had before, good flavor), an amazing veal entree, and 1 dessert + 1 complimentary dessert for his birthday. everything was stellar... i didn't have extremely high expectations so me and my taste buds were ever so thrilled all night. best part was, our two-person birthday dinner with drinks came to $270 total including tax and a generous tip. very reasonable in my opinion... keep in mind we ordered enough food for 3-4 normal people. :) \n\na special night! \n\nit would be really hard for one to have a bad night here. even if it's just for a drink or dessert, or a snack, it's worth the experience.", 
            "the service was good but the food wasnt. the beef wellington was beyond bland, and the halibut wasnt any special either. the warm <mark>Muscovy Duck Breast, Camargue Rice, Pistachio, Sauce Foie Gras</mark> and the salad was the only 2 good dishes. for dessert, we got the chocolate platter which was super disappointing since it was recommend to us by the waitress. the lava cake was dry and overcooked, the chocolate ice cream was nothing special and the mousse was quite sweet", 
            "random info: tasting menu is $125, wine paring optional, additional $79. average individual entree ranges between $50~$80. the elevator to the restaurant is located in the middle of the paris casino. \n\nambiance: excellent. in terms of view of the bellagio fountain this is probably the best place to dine! (be sure to ask for a good table if you come here for the view ;).) \n\nfood: good. the first time i came here with my girlfriend we had lamp chop and a steak. i thought those dishes were quite average. the second time i came here with my clients, and we had the chief's tasting menu which i thought it was definitely one of the better tasting menu i had come across. the <mark>Muscovy Duck Breast, Camargue Rice, Pistachio, Sauce Foie Gras</mark>, which is duck liver was amazing! \n\nparking: good. free parking if you don't mind the walking. on the other hand valet is only $3~5 bucks depends on how much you want to tip. i always valet when i'm in vegas it is so freaking convenient! \n\nservice: excellent. first of all there are people greet you right at the elevator, and will escort you to the restaurant. if you are having the tasting menu, your utensils will be swapped out for clean ones after every course. and oh, beware they have restroom attendants, be sure to bring some cash for tips. water is always filled on time, sometimes the vp/manager will walk around and personally make sure everything is ok. \n\nconclusion: hands down one of the best view in vegas! good food. over the top service. a good place to impress a date/client. dinner for two, expect the bill to be $200 if you order off the menu. $280 ~ $450 if you are getting the tasting menu.", 
            "service is excellent.  i had <mark>Muscovy Duck Breast, Camargue Rice, Pistachio, Sauce Foie Gras</mark>.  it was delicious.  the duck was perfectly done.  the lobster medallion appetizer was very good as was the roast chicken.  the warm ceasar salad was unique.   all in all an a plus dinner and worth the cost.  ask for tom and carlos to wait on you as they are a team.",

            "i once read, \" don't be so quick to judge, you never know when you might just find yourself walking in that person's shoes.\" well, in my experience of dining at eiffel tower restaurant, that quote might just very well ends with \"you never know when you might just find yourself sitting at their best table, and enjoy it, too!!\"\n\nwhile planning our anniversary/christmas trip to vegas, bf asked that i must plan a meal here because he had such a phenomenal experience in the past. i begrudgingly agreed because i thought there are so many new and exciting restaurants on the strip that we can try. so, me, being the shortsighted idiot, made a reservation for lunch instead of dinner. \n\nafter we checked in with the host and hopped onto the exclusive elevator that somehow managed to transport us from the tackiness around paris hotel to a realm of sheer elegance. sure enough, knowing it was an anniversary celebration trip for us, the thoughtful folks from eiffel tower restaurant seated us at their famous corner table (yes, table 56!!) with the breathtaking view, the etiquettes from our attentive ma\\u00eetre d', server, and busboy, i suddenly realized that my bf's stubbornness wasn't that much of a burden after all. \n\nour server and bus boy promptly presented and served us the menu and freshly made baguette. our server thoroughly explained every item on the menu to us, and we opted for:\n\n- creamy french onion soup (unlike any other french onion soup, this wasn't as cheesy nor greasy but rather light. please don't get me wrong; the flavors and the creaminess weren't compromised in any way.)\n- cold <mark>Muscovy Duck Breast, Camargue Rice, Pistachio, Sauce Foie Gras</mark> torchon (rich and dense <mark>Muscovy Duck Breast, Camargue Rice, Pistachio, Sauce Foie Gras</mark> wrapped with duck prosciutto, along with fig, and then smeared on top of the brioche. i particularly enjoyed how the <mark>Muscovy Duck Breast, Camargue Rice, Pistachio, Sauce Foie Gras</mark> was presented in a similar texture as butter and the way it melts upon ingestion.)\n- lamb burger (as a big fan of lamb, i naturally ordered it medium rare. the spices immersed the lamb heavenly, served with chips, and a side of harissa aioli.) \n- aged parmesan crusted chicken (crispy and juicy, it reminded me of the chicken schnitzel that i had from \"johannes\" at palms springs.)\n\nplus...\n\n- apple strudel (i usually don't like to mix fruit with dessert, so it's my bf who ordered this. however, i fairly enjoyed my few bites of p\\u00e2te feuillet\\u00e9e dipped in the caramel sauce.)\n\nother than the strudel, they also sent us a complimentary chocolate souffl\\u00e9 for our anniversary, which was a very lovely gesture. now that i'm thinking back, my biggest regret during my entire trip was that not only i didn't get to taste their evening tasting menu, but i also didn't get a chance to try their famous grand marnier souffl\\u00e9 (since it's only served during dinner.) mind you, prior to my lunch at eiffel tower, bf and i had just our previous dinner at \"le cirque,\" and quite frankly that dinner was not even close to this lunch at eiffel tower restaurant. i applaud the classiness of their attentive and gracious staffs. my highest compliments to the chefs and the entire eiffel tower restaurant team, for this exceptionally exquisite meal and making us feel special the entire time. i cannot wait to go back!!", 
            "i returned to the eiffel tower restaurant for a special dinner.  i had been there for dinner once before and i've had lunch several times.  it's always a great view and the service is exemplary.  the food didn't match either this time around.\n\ni got the five course tasting menu.  it turned out to be lackluster and not what i had come to expect.  the first course was a sea scallop with celery prepared three ways.  the scallop was perfectly cooked and tasty but the celery pur\\u00e9e and other preparations were bland.\n\ncourse two was the warm new york state <mark>Muscovy Duck Breast, Camargue Rice, Pistachio, Sauce Foie Gras</mark>.  this was very disappointing.  the one end of the <mark>Muscovy Duck Breast, Camargue Rice, Pistachio, Sauce Foie Gras</mark> was like a piece of mushy chicken liver.  their was no firmness to the foie and it was warm not seared.  the braised pineapple wedge overpowered an already weak foie.  the alsace spice cake served with the foie was very hard and not the gingerbread of the alsace region i expected.\n\ncourse three--arctic char.  this was well done and about the best of the meal other than dessert.  the char was cooked perfectly and the horseradish emulsion was a good accompaniment.\n\ncourse four was spice crusted venison served on a bed of red cabbage.  the venison was good, but i didn't taste any of the spice coating.  the red cabbage and some apples were a good counterpoint to each other along with huckleberry jus.\n\nthe best part of the evening was the mandarin orange souffl\\u00e9.  the souffl\\u00e9 had a wonderful orange flavor and was served with warm cr\\u00e8me anglaise poured into the slot made in the top of the souffl\\u00e9.\n\ni guess this restaurant has now become a place to say you come here for the view, not the food.  too many misses and not enough hits.  i guess when i come back, it will be for lunch.  i'll miss the evening fountain shows at the bellagio and the wonderful view, but i won't miss paying the price for a meal that leaves so much to be desired and a lack of creativity i had seen before.", 
            "the location was well appointed with a great view of the strip below. \n\nthe cold <mark>Muscovy Duck Breast, Camargue Rice, Pistachio, Sauce Foie Gras</mark> torchon was recommended over the saut\\u00e9ed new york state <mark>Muscovy Duck Breast, Camargue Rice, Pistachio, Sauce Foie Gras</mark> which would have been our initial choice, and we were not disappointed. the <mark>Cold <mark>Muscovy Duck Breast, Camargue Rice, Pistachio, Sauce Foie Gras</mark> Torchon, Duck Prosciutto, Fig Compote</mark> was a perfect complement to the <mark>Muscovy Duck Breast, Camargue Rice, Pistachio, Sauce Foie Gras</mark>. \n\nthe wine list is heavily tilted towards wines that run from the cost of a decent dinner to the list price of a used honda accord. it is not an inexpensive place. we did a drink each and a glass of wine. \n\nthe bone-in rib eye was magnificent as was the recommended green peppercorn sauce. my wife enjoyed her steak and my daughter loved her chicken dish. \n\nfor me, wife, and daughter, it was about $500+. i would think that this could have been pulled off in chicago with a more egalitarian wine list and the same quality for $300-$350 (maybe), even with a bottle of wine, so don't come looking for a moderate price point. \n\ngood service, great view, great food, but a bit expensive for what it is. if the cost works for you, give it a try.", 
            "a nitty-gritty layman's guide to the eiffel tower restaurant\n\nreservations:  a must, particularly if you'd like to be seated during pique lunch or dinner hour.  if you're flexible, i.e. supper at 9:45, take a chance and walk in.\n\nattire:  business casual. (we were somewhat dressier.)  i witnessed a couple being turned away because of their jeans and tee shirts.\n\nservice:  spot on.  our server, michael, was friendly and helpful.  we never wanted for a thing.\n\nwine:  if you're a connoisseur, i suspect you'll delight in the wine list.  if you're like me, a person who appreciates a california red, but doesn't want to spend an arm and a leg, your choices are limited.  you can order shiraz at $12 a glass, or go for a bottle of rodney strong merlot @ $59, which is what we did.  over-priced, but less money than virtually everything else.  by the way, if you choose to bring your own wine, expect a ludicrous corkage fee of $75 per bottle.\n\nprix fixe: the six course tasting menu is $125 per person.  wine pairing is an additional $79 and if you'd like a souffl\\u00e9, tack on $8 more.  two things to note: 1) if one person wants the prix fixe, everyone at the table must be in accord and order the same. 2) there is no flexibility in the  menu. courses are as presented with no choice or substitutions. (based on reviews of the venison, we decided to order a la carte.)\n\nour meals\nappetizers:   of the appetizers, two were particularly good:  the casco bay sea scallops and my cold <mark>Muscovy Duck Breast, Camargue Rice, Pistachio, Sauce Foie Gras</mark> which was melt-in-your-mouth delicious.  i could have done without the accompanying <mark>Cold <mark>Muscovy Duck Breast, Camargue Rice, Pistachio, Sauce Foie Gras</mark> Torchon, Duck Prosciutto, Fig Compote</mark> or toast points.  (make your selection from the bread basket instead.)\n\nsalad: my husband and daughter ordered the market green salad, which appeared unremarkable.  better choice may be what's called the  \"non-traditional\" caesar salad with <mark>Non-Traditional Caesar Salad, Warm Anchovies, Capers and Garlic Vinaigrette</mark>.\n\nentrees:  perhaps the best received dish was t's roasted rack of lamb and tomato tart.  he thought it impeccable.  my muscovy duck breast was good, but not as tasty as duck i recently had in atlanta. my daughter enjoyed her <mark>'The King' <mark>'The Queen' Broiled Beef Tenderloin Filet Mignon</mark></mark>, but again, there was nothing extraordinary about it.  you'll find that meats are high quality,  and cooked to perfection.  if you want it rare, you'll get it rare.\n\ndessert:  curious about the \"acclaimed\" souffl\\u00e9s, we ordered two.  (note that the order must go in, early on.)  none of us were bowled over.  the chocolate souffl\\u00e9 was ordinary, the caramel somewhat better.   perhaps this is petty, but coffee at $7 per person seems excessive.....\n\nin summation: i vacillate between three and four stars.  we spent $500 for dinner that was indeed good, but hardly stand-out.  i'm happy for the experience ; the view of the fountains, as everyone points out, can't be beat.  am i glad we came?  sure!  will we return?  nope.",

            "this place was great change of scenery and food that you should expect  from a vegas high end restaurant. with so many steak house options in vegas, why not opt for delicious french food with a great view.\n\npros:\n\nservice: my waitress was very professional and had a great attitude. she kept checking up on my table to make sure i had everything i needed and that i was satisfied with my food. \n\nfood: starting from the <mark>Muscovy Duck Breast, Camargue Rice, Pistachio, Sauce Foie Gras</mark> to the desserts, all the items were decadent. \n\nplating: the presentation was beautiful and lived up the standards\n\nview: even though i made reservations ahead of time, i was disappointed that i did not get the window seats as i requested in advance. i wasn't too disappointed since every seat in the restaurant still gives you a beautiful view of the bellagio hotel and the bellagio fountains especially if you're dining at night."

            "woohoo! as good as it gets!\n\nto this establishment, first and foremost: thank you.  i had a special occasion that i wished to more than just celebrate -- i wanted to honor it.  through every aspect within their power, their execution was flawless.\n\nit all started with communicating my intentions to one of the managers, whose information i took from prior review responses.  i figured if someone cared enough to write back to people, they might be the right sort to handle my requests with care.  i couldn't have been more right.  laurent ertle is the man i owe the uncanny success of the following.\n\nthrough him, his suggestions, and his staff, when the night came, everything flowed effortlessly.  we pre-arranged the time and table to have, in my opinion, the best seats in the house.  the view and progression of the evening was marvelous.  a prepayment plan was set in place to avoid that awkward distraction at the end of the evening.  i was even granted the appropriate menus and floral piece for the table.\n\nafter the warm welcome to our seats, the evening began with a cocktail.  expressing an interest in st. germain, our server when to ask the bar on specialties.  what returned was their version of a french 75.  a delightfully fragrant, subtly sweet, and slightly strong drink -- the perfect definition of a cocktail.\n\nshortly thereafter, we were given a choice of bread to have.  while normally i would have picked a different bread to try each time around, i just couldn't get past having more of the wonderful french baguette -- rightfully so, considering the venue.  then we were given a sample of gazpacho.  it was creamy and smooth being watery in neither flavor nor texture.  thus it was obvious to me that the selection of vegetables, spices, and method was very deliberate.  to follow was an amuse bouche.  i had to ask the waiter twice what the trio was, and i still unfortunately forgot what they were exactly.  so instead of exact, i'll be broad: one was a fluffy, rich cheese-pastry; second was an oyster topped with caviar on a bed of black pepper and sea-salt; third was a mini quiche looking bite.  it succeeded in spurring my appetite for more.  for appetizers we ordered a corn soup and roasted <mark>Muscovy Duck Breast, Camargue Rice, Pistachio, Sauce Foie Gras</mark>.  the soup was the result of for some inexplicable reason that they don't serve french onion soup, which i would have considered a given.  simple and tasty the soup was with a good marrying of ripe corn and hints of bacon.  the <mark>Muscovy Duck Breast, Camargue Rice, Pistachio, Sauce Foie Gras</mark> was luxuriously rich, and smartly paired with grapes and crisps for palate contrast and cleansing.\n\nour main courses were the <mark>Prime Aged New York Steak</mark> and <mark>Broiled 22 oz. Bone-in Ribeye, Roasted Bone Marrow</mark> in a cabernet reduction as well as a beef wellington with <mark>Individual Eiffel Tower Beef Wellington, Sauteed Snap Peas</mark>.  i will say that my definition of medium-rare must differ from the kitchen's, but it's typically against my principles to argue with a chef's execution unless gross malpractice has occurred.  after just one bite, i forgot about any disagreement i might have had.  i was reminded that the quality of cut and preparation is at least as important as the method.  the marrow and reduction added a level of depth new to me with such a course.  the complex flavors still make me salivate at the mere memory of them.  the wellington was flawless in every way -- from presentation to indulgence.  the pastry shell advertised the culinary art contained.  it was flaky and refined.  inside was a wonderfully tender, and expertly cooked, cut of beef.  more-so this course, i very easily would recommend it to anyone.\n\ndesert was a pair of souffles, that have to be ordered at the very beginning due to their complexity.  we had a gran marnier and pistachio.  both light and delicious, which was the point of getting two.  i have to say i preferred the pistachio, but that is far from an easy decision to make -- i had to compare one to the other exhaustively.  the petit fours were simple treats of milk chocolate, fudge, white chocolate, or mango.  they definitely were unimpressive, but that's what happens when everything else was so far above standard.\n\ni had asked the photographer to return so that our photo would take place with the night lights of the bellagio fountains.  not only did she, but she was enough of a perfectionist to wait for the exact right moment of the fountain show to snap the moment.  she also had our finished photo to us in what seemed like no time at all.\n\na special note must be given to the server, mario.  not to be confused with the waiter (which for the first time for me, was not the same person).  he was an absolute pleasure to have around.  he was not only prompt and courteous in profession, but also charming and humorous in conversation.  it was the type of thing that beside all the foreign luxury we were surrounded in, there still was a sense of reality to ground the experience in memory instead of fantasy.\n\ni was denied the tower ride due to mother nature, but hopefully that will also encourage me to return again to at least shake laurent ertle's hand.", 
            "this was the best meal that i can remember! i brought my love here on a date while here in vegas. i made the reservation well in advance a must for any of the nicer restaurants out here, and the only way to get a coveted window seat! i chose to have roses waiting for her at the table, which can be added to the dinner bill, and they were nicely arranged in a glass vase and sitting among a classy place setting. we had a beautiful view of the strip, the bellagio fountain in particular. after we were served bread and a delightful fresh soup (chilled tomato with watermelon- i was terrified; but it was terrific!) she ordered the beef wellington with <mark>Individual Eiffel Tower Beef Wellington, Sauteed Snap Peas</mark>, i had the free range chicken with artichokes two ways, and we shared some potatoes gratin. for desert we had the pistachio souffl\\u00e9. all of the food was perfectly prepared and gorgeously plated. the service was fantastic. the restaurant was beautiful and the view was stunning. i had an amazing time. the only caveat would be that it is pricey, but judging from my experience worth every penny!", 
            "very very good but service seemed like it could be better. i was in town for 2 nights and had to dine at some of the many celebrity chef's restaurants that are in this town. tonight i chose chef joho's restaurant at the eiffel tower. i was surprised i made the reservations earlier that day and they actually had an opening. i requested a window table overlooking the bellagio fountains but when they took us to our table it was that. so i went up to the hosts stand and asked if it were possible to sit by the window. they said it would only be a few minutes and we got the perfect seats in the house it seemed like. for a starter we got the napoleon of alaska king crab and avocado which was phenomenal, very light and fresh flavors, perfect way to start. the main course i got the beef wellington with <mark>Individual Eiffel Tower Beef Wellington, Sauteed Snap Peas</mark>. very good however i did have gordon ramsey's beef wellington a week before and i have to say that was better but it was still very good. the <mark>Individual Eiffel Tower Beef Wellington, Sauteed Snap Peas</mark> made a lovely side. service though! seemed like our server was very rushed so we had to ask him quickly for what we needed while we had him before he ran off. at this type of cuisine service should be very friendly and inviting. one time i started to ask him something but it was already too late, he was gone in a flash. but other than that it was an excellent experience."

            "don't let the theme-park like location fool you, this restaurant is serious cuisine for serious foodies.  the atmosphere is elegant, yet lively, with art-deco inspired fixtures and furnishings complementing a spectacular view of the strip.  the staff is warm and attentive, without being intrusive.  and, the menu...an absolute delight.  you can choose from chef joho's exquisite seven course signature tasting menu or extensive a la carte selection.  i highly recommend the warm lobster salad with garlic braised artichokes.  a superb blend of flavors and textures.  the roast rack of lamb is also quite wonderful.  cooked to perfection with a crisp herb crust drizzled with a <mark>Roasted Rack of Lamb, Tomato Tart, Tarragon Jus</mark>.  make sure you save room for dessert.  the souffl\\u00e9s are not to be missed....i recommend either the pistachio or grand marnier.....and the raspberry napoleon is splendid.  also, don't be surprised if you're visited by the eiffel tower's manager, laurent ertle, during your dining experience.  he works to make sure that every guest is treated with exceptional care.  i've now been to the restaurant about a half-dozen times and each experience has been marvelous and memorable.  one final note, prices are what you would expect from a fine restaurant, but they are realistic, not inflated, and the value is outstanding.", 
            "my boyfriend and i were super late and kept pushing back our reservation 15, 30, 45 minutes later and the staff were incredibly accommodating. they didn't have to be, but it just goes to show you how immaculately professional and courteous this place is.\n\nwhen we finally arrived, we waited no more than 10 minutes to be seated at a window seat with the most luscious view of the bellagio fountains. the hostess, our server and even the random guy that came around to give us more bread rolls and cheese balls were all kind, polite and never once rushed us throughout our entire 3 hour (!!!) dinner. \n\nif you do decide to come here i highly recommend the tasting menu. while a few of the dishes were quite forgettable, the the view and the service more than made up for it. we had:\n\n- trio of appetizers/les amuses bouche: the mushroom custard was incredible.\n- warm lobster soup: the soup itself was lovely, but it was covered it what i can only guess was a spring roll wrapper. curious, indeed.\n- halibut: good, but meh.\n- roasted rack of lamb with <mark>Roasted Rack of Lamb, Tomato Tart, Tarragon Jus</mark>: highlight of the evening. the lamb was tender with a slightly crispy \"crust.\" \n- camembert wrapped in poached pears: seriously disgusting. i like cheese, but that combo was hard to stomach.\n- i had the grand marnier souffle and he had the pistachio souffle. both we exquisite--both exhibited a delicate taste through the slightly eggy custard texture. the server suggested the chocolate souffle which we will definitely try the next time.", 
            "i will describe our eiffel tower restaurant experience in one word, \"magnifique!\"\n\ni took my wife to this restaurant a little unsure if it was going to be worth the high price tag and it definitely was.  our bill was $210 w/ tax and tip (18%) and we ordered the following:\n\n1st course\nroasted foi gras appetizer (a++++++++) \nabsolutely marvelous, pure heaven!\nserved on a bed of marinated grapes and julienne crepes the foi gras completely melted in our mouths and the three tastes blended together exquisitely.\n\nentrees\nroasted quail w/ <mark>Roasted Rack of Lamb, Tomato Tart, Tarragon Jus</mark> & white & red cabbage (a++) \nrack of lamb w/ <mark>Roasted Rack of Lamb, Tomato Tart, Tarragon Jus</mark>, white bean stew & grilled sweet onion (a++++++++++) \ncreamed spinach & mushroom side dish (a++)\n\nwe decided to order two entrees, one moderately priced and one high end, in order to stay with our budget.  we shared each of them so we could sample all of the flavors.  \n\nthe quail was very good, it was our first time trying it and we would definitely order it again.  not gamey at all and the meat was so savory.  the only downfall with the quail is there is not much meat because it is a smaller bird, but great nonetheless.  the cold cabbage side was so good and complemented the bird perfectly.  \n\nnow for the rack of lamb.  as you may have seen in most of these reviews, everyone loves the lamb.  we will take it one step furthur, we absolutely lust for this lamb.  wow quite possibly one of the best lamb dishes i have ever had, mouth watering and succulent, it is a must order on their menu.  the sides again complemented the meat perfectly.\n\nthe creamed spinach side was a great complement to the meal and was not overly creamy.  it was perfectly baked and crusty on top, definitely the best creamed spinach dish i have ever had.\n\ndesert\nchocolate souffle (a++++)\nthis unbelievable desert was light, fluffy and oh so chocolatey.  it was the perfect ending to our meal.  oh and did i mention it is prepared from scatch while you eat, takes about a half hour.\n\ndrinks\ntwo glasses of the house pinot noir which was very good for their house wine and the wife had a specialty cocktail called \"autumn in paris\" which was fresh crushed pears with vodka and some other fresh things mixed in, in her words, \"it was to die for!\"\n\nthey give you your choice of complementary breads and some finger food desert chocolates and pastries....do yourself a favor and try their french baguettes w/ their house butter and the chocolates filled with caramel syrup, unreal!\n\nall in all we will be coming here everytime we are in vegas.  the service is way above par and attentive to your every need and the views are stunning.  whether its the paris balloon or the belagio fountains you will be in heaven once the ambiance and food mingle together to tickle your senses. just make sure you give yourself at least two hours for this dining experience.\n\nhappy eating!", 
            "thanks boyfriend for an amazing early valentine's day dinner!\n\nout of all the award winning restaurants and famous chefs here on the las vegas trip, i choose to dine at the eiffel tower restaurant because the view looked beautiful from pictures i've seen and for now, this will be the closet thing i'll get to the real eiffel tower in paris.\n\nthe eiffel tower restaurant has its own private elevator that takes you up 11 stories. i had requested a window seat when i made my reservations through opentable and fortunately enough, we got window seats directly facing the bellagio fountains\n\nwhile we waited for our table to be ready, the boyfriend and i each started off with a cocktail. i dont remember the names, but i know the one i got was the eiffel tower's signature drink - a sangria type drink with a mixture of berries and bubbly like champagne. the other one was a type of pear infused drink.\n\nfor appetizers, the two of us shared the grand seafood platter which could have been an entree by itself. it is a little pricey ($98) but i think its well worth it. we got a whole lobster split in half, a giant king crab leg with a good amount of meat in it, several oysters and clams, and jumbo shrimp with three different cocktail sauces. i loved the crab, oysters, and shrimp\n\nfor my entree i got the roasted rack of lamb with <mark>Roasted Rack of Lamb, Tomato Tart, Tarragon Jus</mark> and glazed turnips. the lamb was extremely tender and really flavorful with the sauce. i tried a little bit of the boyfriend's cured duck. we asked what it meant by cured and we were told that it was soaked in coffee the night before. coffee duck sounded a little strange but you cant really taste the coffee and the duck was pretty tender as well. it's not the usual chinese bbq duck im used to. the duck tasted more like some sort of red meat, but still good nonetheless.\n\nfor dessert i went with majority of people's suggestion on yelp and ordered the chocolate souffle. it was delicious! im not a big fan of chocolate but i loved this dessert! the warm chocolate sauce poured into the soft yet slighty crunchy souffle. a must try! and remember to put in the order when you first order your other things because it takes awhile to make.\n\nprice wise, it was on the more expensive side, but it is las vegas. the service here was excellent, the view of the fountains were beautiful, the portions weren't disappointing for a fine dinning restaurant, and i was very happy with everything we got. the only thing i regret not doing is riding up the eiffel tower after dinner. oh well, next time! i would definitely recommend this place to anyone who wants to treat themselves and/or other people to a great dining experience", 
            "out of all the meals that i had here in vegas this was my favorite, it was my first time eating in a french restaurant. we were gonna dine at one of the most fanciest places in all of las vegas, it was me, my dad, mike and his wife martha, joe and his wife deb (joe treated everyone to dinner) and paul and his wife linda (a table of 8). located on the 11th floor of the paris, we took the elevator up and when we walked in we saw the kitchen staff hard at work preparing dinner then we saw this big extraordinary, elegant room and you get a nice view overlooking the bellagio fountains outside. \nwe sat down and while making our decisions for appetizers were treated to a lovely amuse-bouche (french for amusing the mouth, to wake up your palate, with a bite-sized appetizer) it was a shot glass filled with <mark><mark>Lemon Parsley Butter, Bearnaise, Bordelaise, Green Peppercorn, Black Truffle</mark>, Stone Ground Corn, Celery Root</mark> mousseline (mousseline is a creamy soup-like sauce when you fold whipped cream into hollandaise) it was topped with some chopped celery for some texture (a nice way to start the meal and to wake up the palate). for my appetizer i got the new york state <mark>Muscovy Duck Breast, Camargue Rice, Pistachio, Sauce Foie Gras</mark> which was sitting on a crispy alsace spice cake with quince compote and petite mache (<mark>Muscovy Duck Breast, Camargue Rice, Pistachio, Sauce Foie Gras</mark>, which is what i call meaty butter, melts in your mouth, quince a tart fruit, similar to a pear in appearance but has the similar taste and texture to an apple, spice cake was a nice crunchy little wafer spiced with cinnamon and mache a leafy green that has a nutty flavor, it was awesome). \n\nmy dad got the lobster bisque with lobster flan, celery and a brioche crouton (rich, smooth creamy soup with a flan in the center made from lobster stock, you get some crunch from the celery, and then you take a bite of that crispy brioche crouton, its spectacular). everyone else at the shared 2 different salads, the 1st one was a tuscan kale salad, door county dried cherries, cherry tomatoes, quinoa croutons, toasted pecans and finished with a balsamic vinaigrette (so much going on in that salad, crisp, earthy kale, sweetness from the cherries, tartness from the cherry tomatoes, you get crunch from both the croutons and pecans and you get acidity from the vinaigrette). the 2nd one was a non-traditional caesar salad with a dressing made from anchovies, capers and garlic (i honestly don't know what was non-traditional about that salad and i thought the dressing was a tad bit too salty for my taste). \nfor our drinks, while everyone else was mostly having red wine or chardonnay, me and martha partook in one of their signature cocktails: the eiffel affair (consisting of blueberry vodka, cr\\u00e8me de cassis, cointreau, rose nectar, some champagne for that fizzy and bubbly effect and topped off with some fresh berries). \nfor our entrees: i had the rabbit with braised carrots confit and mustard jus (my first time eating rabbit, so moist and tender like chicken, bite from the carrots and sweetness from the mustard jus, they use dijon mustard). my dad and paul had the pan seared pork chop with spiced braised apples and with a calvados sauce (juicy pork, the apples go so well with pork and the calvados sauce was sweet tasting, calvados is an apple brandy), mike got the roasted rack of lamb with tomato tart and <mark>Roasted Rack of Lamb, Tomato Tart, Tarragon Jus</mark> (the bones were beautifully frenched ), martha got the red snapper with razor clams, fingerling potatoes, tomato confit and finished with a shellfish bouillon (the fish had a nice crispy skin), deb and linda had the roasted chicken with apricot, quinoa pilaf and moroccan spices (i love roasted chicken, so flavorful). joe got the char <mark>'The King' <mark>'The Queen' Broiled Beef Tenderloin Filet Mignon</mark></mark> with a <mark>Rossini Style <mark>'The King' <mark>'The Queen' Broiled Beef Tenderloin Filet Mignon</mark></mark>, Foie Gras, Truffle Sauce</mark> (his was the most expensive).\n then we ordered dessert: i got the white chocolate banana elysee (it was named after a building in france, it was sliced bananas and white chocolate disks stacked on top of each other surrounded by a moat of a chocolate/vanilla sauce mixture and at the top there be a little ball made of caramelized sugar, normally i don't eat bananas but this was so damn good, it was the most stunning dessert i've ever eaten, it looked like a spaceship and boy did i take it to my leader, my stomach), mike and martha got the chocolate hazelnut a la parisienne with vanilla ice cream (it resembled a bear claw, mike and martha seemed to enjoy, but i thought it was bitter and after 2 bites i couldn't take anymore), joe and deb got the raspberry napoleon with a vanilla blanc manger and red fruit sorbet (stacked beautifully) and paul and linda got the classic cr\\u00e8me brulee (a bit of a clich\\u00e9). \n\neverything was amazing, but i had to delete the pictures that i took here due to the flash on my camera not working so after calling the restaurant a couple times (10) linda (one of the hostesses) and sharon (one of the general managers) were kind enough to help me out and to email me the pictures. also more thing my dad says you should adjust the lighting cuz it was very dim to him. i really had a nice time here, i'll be sure to come here again the next time i'm in vegas !!!"

            "now *this* is more like it. ultra spendy? you bet. but totally worth it. \n\ni loved everything about this place, and was so, so, so glad we decided to splurge here on our last night in vegas. with no res, we came up the elevator, gave our names and only had to wait about 15 minutes at the bar before we had a seat. the bartender was hilarious & sweet, and the hostess carried our wine over and seated us in a large, plush booth. \n\nthe view = incredible. this place is mid-way up the faux eiffel tower, facing the bellagio - so we got to see the water show more than a few times while we ate. \n\nthe food = even more incredible. we started off with the blue cheese souffl\\u00e9 pudding, walnut pecan petite salad. holy god, that was good. for entrees, we had the <mark>Prime Aged New York Steak</mark>, braised celery heart, <mark>Broiled 22 oz. Bone-in Ribeye, Roasted Bone Marrow</mark>, cabernet reduction and the filet of sea bass, fingerlings, double smoked bacon, crispy potato, petit mache. plus, we shared the <mark>Classic Potato Gratin</mark>. it was all amazing. and they aren't messin' around with the portions. everything was as filling as it was delicious. \n\nto finish off, the special eiffel tower souffl\\u00e9s in chocolate and raspberry. they take 30 minutes to make, so we had the foresight to order them before our meal and they were just perfect. the waiter does this fancypants thing where he pours the cream and chocolate into them at your table and they get all big & fluffy. mmm. mmmm. \n\nthe topper: our *very* french waiter was great! constantly checked up on us, made funny jokes, and didn't even blink when i spilled water all over the table. in fact, he moved us to another! \n\nall in all - just the best. i would for sure splurge to go here again. it was romantic and beautiful and i left completely satisfied.",

Bone-in Ribeye, Roasted Bone Marrow</mark> and cab reduction and thoroughly enjoyed it!  my wife ordered their \"surf and turf\" offering --- prime beef strip loin with butter poached lobster.  amazing dish.  in a city filled excesses of buffets and the like, a nice sit down dinner with perfectly sized portions is like an oasis in the desert.\n\nwe had very good service, probably because we were served by the restaurant captain, ron gonzales.  his service, attention and graciousness scores five stars itself.  he took lots and lots of photos of us, even suggesting that we call him when the fountains start dancing to capture a perfect shot.  he was very quick and offered wonderful suggestions, such as the chocolate souffle which is a must try.  to top it all, ron served my wife with a complimentary chocolate pudding with a big \"happy birthday\" written in chocolate.  the pudding was decadent!\n\nmake sure you call the restaurant and advise them of what you want to do, like birthday celebrations (i hear they do proposals too).  they will work with you on your requests/demands.\n\noverall a great experience!  will come back again definitely!",

            "when my boyfriend asked me if i liked french, i immediately assumed we'd be dining at bouchon. but then he mentioned a spectacular view and i remembered the actual eiffel tower in paris has a restaurant in the middle of it. \n\nit's quite a walk (especially in stilettos!) from the parking lot past the buffet and through the paris casino to the elevator which will take you up to the restaurant.  \n\nwe arrived uncharacteristically late (8:30 for our 8:15 reservation). because we specifically wanted a window seat (which i highly recommend), we ended up waiting over an hour. around 9:45, the hostess let us know that 7 tables had signed their checks and they were just waiting for them to leave. \n\nfirst up, the gazpacho amuse bouche was flavorful and refreshing. oddly, someone walks around with bread (which i suppose is a good thing if you don't want to fill up on it). i preferred the baguette to the multi-grain. we also ordered two glasses of cabernet based on our waiter, tom's, suggestion. \n\nwe started with a summer salad with shaved vegetables and corn soup. i felt the salad was overdressed and yes, there were literally paper thin slices of vegetables. they brought over my soup bowl and poured the liquid contents into the bowl tableside. fancy. it was supposed to have manila clams but i couldn't really taste it although i am always happy to be served bacon. \n\nfor entrees, the boyfriend ordered steak and <mark>Broiled 22 oz. Bone-in Ribeye, Roasted Bone Marrow</mark> while i had the rack of lamb, cooked medium. both were succulent and perfectly cooked and definitely worth the wait. the staff apologized for the long wait. since the kitchen was slammed, our entrees didn't come out until nearly 10:30. \n\nwe ended the meal with a grand marnier souffle (they have 6 kinds), which you have to order at the beginning of the meal. afterwards, they brought out petite fours. yum. \n\nalthough the soup and salad were forgettable, the entrees were amazing and perfectly cooked. what was most impressive was the view. we were seated by the window where it directly faces the bellagio water show. easily the best seat in the house. saw quite a few brides (2-3) at this super romantic venue. highly recommended.", 
            "woohoo! as good as it gets!\n\nto this establishment, first and foremost: thank you.  i had a special occasion that i wished to more than just celebrate -- i wanted to honor it.  through every aspect within their power, their execution was flawless.\n\nit all started with communicating my intentions to one of the managers, whose information i took from prior review responses.  i figured if someone cared enough to write back to people, they might be the right sort to handle my requests with care.  i couldn't have been more right.  laurent ertle is the man i owe the uncanny success of the following.\n\nthrough him, his suggestions, and his staff, when the night came, everything flowed effortlessly.  we pre-arranged the time and table to have, in my opinion, the best seats in the house.  the view and progression of the evening was marvelous.  a prepayment plan was set in place to avoid that awkward distraction at the end of the evening.  i was even granted the appropriate menus and floral piece for the table.\n\nafter the warm welcome to our seats, the evening began with a cocktail.  expressing an interest in st. germain, our server when to ask the bar on specialties.  what returned was their version of a french 75.  a delightfully fragrant, subtly sweet, and slightly strong drink -- the perfect definition of a cocktail.\n\nshortly thereafter, we were given a choice of bread to have.  while normally i would have picked a different bread to try each time around, i just couldn't get past having more of the wonderful french baguette -- rightfully so, considering the venue.  then we were given a sample of gazpacho.  it was creamy and smooth being watery in neither flavor nor texture.  thus it was obvious to me that the selection of vegetables, spices, and method was very deliberate.  to follow was an amuse bouche.  i had to ask the waiter twice what the trio was, and i still unfortunately forgot what they were exactly.  so instead of exact, i'll be broad: one was a fluffy, rich cheese-pastry; second was an oyster topped with caviar on a bed of black pepper and sea-salt; third was a mini quiche looking bite.  it succeeded in spurring my appetite for more.  for appetizers we ordered a corn soup and roasted <mark>Muscovy Duck Breast, Camargue Rice, Pistachio, Sauce Foie Gras</mark>.  the soup was the result of for some inexplicable reason that they don't serve french onion soup, which i would have considered a given.  simple and tasty the soup was with a good marrying of ripe corn and hints of bacon.  the <mark>Muscovy Duck Breast, Camargue Rice, Pistachio, Sauce Foie Gras</mark> was luxuriously rich, and smartly paired with grapes and crisps for palate contrast and cleansing.\n\nour main courses were the <mark>Prime Aged New York Steak</mark> and <mark>Broiled 22 oz. Bone-in Ribeye, Roasted Bone Marrow</mark> in a cabernet reduction as well as a beef wellington with <mark>Individual Eiffel Tower Beef Wellington, Sauteed Snap Peas</mark>.  i will say that my definition of medium-rare must differ from the kitchen's, but it's typically against my principles to argue with a chef's execution unless gross malpractice has occurred.  after just one bite, i forgot about any disagreement i might have had.  i was reminded that the quality of cut and preparation is at least as important as the method.  the marrow and reduction added a level of depth new to me with such a course.  the complex flavors still make me salivate at the mere memory of them.  the wellington was flawless in every way -- from presentation to indulgence.  the pastry shell advertised the culinary art contained.  it was flaky and refined.  inside was a wonderfully tender, and expertly cooked, cut of beef.  more-so this course, i very easily would recommend it to anyone.\n\ndesert was a pair of souffles, that have to be ordered at the very beginning due to their complexity.  we had a gran marnier and pistachio.  both light and delicious, which was the point of getting two.  i have to say i preferred the pistachio, but that is far from an easy decision to make -- i had to compare one to the other exhaustively.  the petit fours were simple treats of milk chocolate, fudge, white chocolate, or mango.  they definitely were unimpressive, but that's what happens when everything else was so far above standard.\n\ni had asked the photographer to return so that our photo would take place with the night lights of the bellagio fountains.  not only did she, but she was enough of a perfectionist to wait for the exact right moment of the fountain show to snap the moment.  she also had our finished photo to us in what seemed like no time at all.\n\na special note must be given to the server, mario.  not to be confused with the waiter (which for the first time for me, was not the same person).  he was an absolute pleasure to have around.  he was not only prompt and courteous in profession, but also charming and humorous in conversation.  it was the type of thing that beside all the foreign luxury we were surrounded in, there still was a sense of reality to ground the experience in memory instead of fantasy.\n\ni was denied the tower ride due to mother nature, but hopefully that will also encourage me to return again to at least shake laurent ertle's hand.", 
            "celebrated our anniversary here, made reservations and asked for a table with the bellagio fountain views. hostesses were nice informed us it would be a few more minutes so we got a drink at the bar, very pricey drinks but they did have my favorite bleu cheese stuffed olives. finally seated and they did honor my request for the fountain view, such a romantic spot. our server greeted us an older gentleman but right away we could tell he was snobby and looked down at us since we were a young couple. just brushed him off, for a starter we had the scallops, so delicious served with baby carrots and a  puree that i can't remember but oh man so good! for dinner i had the filet while my husband had the ny strip with <mark>Broiled 22 oz. Bone-in Ribeye, Roasted Bone Marrow</mark>, to share we also ordered asparagus, mushroom & spinach along with pommes rissolees, these fried potatoes. everything except the potatoes was delicious!  just melt in your mouth delicious. steaks were cooked perfectly, we were so stuffed. i dont know why my husband ordered a warm apple strudel because our server brought us an anniversary dessert which i noted in our reservations and we were in a food coma after that. i highly recommend this spot for a romantic dinner. be prepared to spend some money but its worth every penny.",

Bone-in Ribeye, Roasted Bone Marrow</mark> accompanied with a side of pillowy soft mashed potatoes.  *food coma mode*\n\nlastly, the chocolate souffle! they served it by pouring warm, melting chocolate into the souffle.  it was very moist and soft with a balanced sweetness from the chocolate.\n\none thing i really appreciated was them filling your glass of water each time it was low.\n\nyou might not be in the real paris, but the experience here definitely made you feel like you were in the city of lights.  merci beaucoup eiffel tower restaurant for a magical and elegant evening.",

            "now *this* is more like it. ultra spendy? you bet. but totally worth it. \n\ni loved everything about this place, and was so, so, so glad we decided to splurge here on our last night in vegas. with no res, we came up the elevator, gave our names and only had to wait about 15 minutes at the bar before we had a seat. the bartender was hilarious & sweet, and the hostess carried our wine over and seated us in a large, plush booth. \n\nthe view = incredible. this place is mid-way up the faux eiffel tower, facing the bellagio - so we got to see the water show more than a few times while we ate. \n\nthe food = even more incredible. we started off with the blue cheese souffl\\u00e9 pudding, walnut pecan petite salad. holy god, that was good. for entrees, we had the <mark>Prime Aged New York Steak</mark>, braised celery heart, <mark>Broiled 22 oz. Bone-in Ribeye, Roasted Bone Marrow</mark>, cabernet reduction and the filet of sea bass, fingerlings, double smoked bacon, crispy potato, petit mache. plus, we shared the <mark>Classic Potato Gratin</mark>. it was all amazing. and they aren't messin' around with the portions. everything was as filling as it was delicious. \n\nto finish off, the special eiffel tower souffl\\u00e9s in chocolate and raspberry. they take 30 minutes to make, so we had the foresight to order them before our meal and they were just perfect. the waiter does this fancypants thing where he pours the cream and chocolate into them at your table and they get all big & fluffy. mmm. mmmm. \n\nthe topper: our *very* french waiter was great! constantly checked up on us, made funny jokes, and didn't even blink when i spilled water all over the table. in fact, he moved us to another! \n\nall in all - just the best. i would for sure splurge to go here again. it was romantic and beautiful and i left completely satisfied.", 
            "what an experience! it's comparable to having dinner @ pier 39 in san francisco watching the sea lions lay there motionless. yes. it's that epic.\n\nthe ambiance, decor, and 360 panoramic view is breathtaking. they should make their patrons pay just entering this place. but of course, those breathtaking feature do make an appearance on your bill listed next to your food items. \n\nservice:\n\nthis is where the very annoying, yet true saying applies, \"you get what you pay for.\" there were at least 3 servers waiting on our table of 12, which felt really nice. the servers were very pleasant and willing to do whatever it takes to satisfy our visit. i was really appreciative of each and everyone of them. \n\nbread was served to each person individually while you choose you dinner items and enjoy your cocktails. i was surprised at how long it took before our server took our order, but once we placed our orders, the wine arrived and 15 minutes later all the appetizers, then 20+ minutes later the first course, 30+ minutes later the main course, and 1 hour+ after the desert. it was relatively nice to have that cushion to digest and tipsy chat.  i was definitely not use to the time and the leisure of having the time cushion, but considering the view, it was well worth it!\n\nfood:\n\nquality wise, everything was amazingly fresh. from the <mark>Grand Seafood Platter, Lobster, Shrimp, Crab, Oysters, Clams</mark>, lobsters, shrimp and quality cut meats, it was well worth the $$$$. our party ordered about 5 appetizers, all of which tasted good.\n\n i ordered the surf and turf entree which is a <mark>Prime Aged New York Steak</mark> with a crab cake. i was surprised at how simple it tasted. don't get me wrong, the food was good, but it just wasn't fantastic or outstanding. if i were to grade it, the food tasted b average while the quality was an outstanding a.\n\nafter sobering up, i would really wished the chef  got creative with flavors and tastes. using crazy herbs and spices to blend the perfect $$$$ taste, which is what we paid. over 1800. the eiffel tower restaurant is still remarkable experience i recommend.", 
            "this place was amazing! the food was very good and top shelf. the <mark>Prime Aged New York Steak</mark> will melt in your mouth. the view of the bellagio watershow was great. i highly recommend this place. just know everything is al a cart and you pay for what you get. you can preview the menu on-line. \n\nthe ride up to the top is a must also.", 
            "the main reason i came to eat here was for the view. and it was the best part. all tables get a view of the bellagio's water fountain, although not every table has the best view. it felt awkward to take pictures inside the restaurant, but my family had no problem flashing away at everything.\n\nnow the food and cocktails. cocktails were upwards of $16. we had the pimm's cup, red velvet, and sparkling passion. all of them were extremely good and perfectly mixed. we ordered the warm <mark>Muscovy Duck Breast, Camargue Rice, Pistachio, Sauce Foie Gras</mark> to start. it's so tiny the four slices of pear that accompany it was a bigger portion. but it was smooth and melt in your mouth. definitely not worth the price. next to come out was the veal medallions. this is a must get; it was delicious. we had it come out with the appetizers.\n\nnow for the entrees:\nthey ran out of black cod, by the time we got there, so we got the sea bass. it was good, a might order again.\nthe cured duck breast was not that great. i like fatty chinese roasted duck much better, a definite will not order again.\nrack of lamb was perfect; cooked to perfection and tasted so tender, will order again.\nwe had two <mark>Prime Aged New York Steak</mark>, both ordered medium rare, but one came out a little drier. it is also a will order again. i regret not ordering a surf and turf instead of the second ny steak.\n\nto finish off, we had ordered two souffles when told they need to be ordered in advanced. not sure if we ate too quickly, but we waited a good fifteen minutes between the entrees and dessert. but then they came, one chocolate souffle, and the other waiter-recommended grand marnier souffle. both were great, but definitely the grand marnier souffle was the best, will come just for this!\n\nin all, the food was great. not sure i would come back because it didn't seem like the food was worth the price. next time, i'll just stick at the bar for the view.",

            "my husband and i dined here the other night to celebrate my birthday and what a great experience it was! i had called about a week in advance to make a reservation. to my surprise, they asked for my credit card number over the phone, which i have never done before. this guarantees your reservation, and if you cancel i believe they charge $50 to your card. a dress code is also enforced, although the woman i spoke to over the phone told me that jeans are allowed as long as they are not ripped up. \n\nas others have already mentioned, you take the (small) elevator to the 11th floor where the restaurant is located. the elevator opens up in front of the kitchen. as soon as we arrived, one of the employees said \"what are you doing in the kitchen?\" he then gave us a warm greeting and walked us to where we would check in. \n\nwe had a great table by the window with a awesome view! my husband and i thought the restaurant would be higher up than it actually was, but it was perfect! we really enjoyed the view of the bellagio fountains (every 15 minutes) and the strip. \n\nwhat we ordered for dinner:\n-maine peekey toe crab salad: with cucumber and black sesame seeds. very light and tasty with a vinaigrette type of dressing. good choice for an appetizer!\n\n-char <mark>'The King' <mark>'The Queen' Broiled Beef Tenderloin Filet Mignon</mark></mark>: with lemon parsley butter. it was cooked the way i wanted and easy to cut into pieces. it wasn't the best steak i have ever eaten, but i still enjoyed it. i also felt that the butter was too thick and it took a while to melt down. \n\n-<mark>Prime Aged New York Steak</mark>: my husband ordered this. he pretty much felt the same way i did about my steak. it was good, but definitely not the best.\n\n-<mark>Galette of Potato Anna</mark>: as our side order. it was basically thinly sliced potatoes that were layered on a plate. not much to say about it, but there's nothing wrong with potatoes cooked with butter!\n\nfor dessert:\n-chocolate souffle: after we ordered our dinner, our server asked us if we wanted to order a souffle because it takes about 30 minutes for them to prepare it. it was interesting when they brought it to our table. first they make a hole in the center of the souffle, then they pour in the chocolate sauce inside. i was a bit disappointed because it wasn't as good as i was hoping it to be. the cake was very moist and fluffy, but i felt that it needed more chocolate sauce.\n\n-i was surprised with a complimentary chocolate mousse for my birthday! it tasted great and i definitely enjoyed it more than the chocolate souffle! i also liked how they served it on a plate with \"happy birthday\" written in chocolate sauce!\n\nservice was top notch! our server was pierre. he was friendly, entertaining, and very attentive. he made us laugh, smile, and really wanted us to enjoy our dinner! also there is a photographer that walks around asking if you would like to take a picture with the illuminated paris balloon in the background. we decided why not, and liked how it came out. we paid $24 for a 5x7 photo. ouch. i know, but it was worth it for us!\n\nmy only complaint is that the tables are packed in very close together. the aisles are also very narrow, so it takes a while to pass by other tables and to get out. \n\nour bill was expensive! but we definitely enjoyed the experience and our night here! hopefully the food will be better the second time around if we ever come back!", 
            "my husband and i celebrated our 1st wedding anniversary in vegas last month and decided to have dinner here for the actual night of our anniversary.\n\nwhen he made the reservation, he requested for a table by the window with the view of the bellagio fountains. he was told that they can't guarantee that and we'll just have to basically try our luck when we get there. we were so happy to find out that they have reserved a table for us by the corner (closest to the paris balloon) with the view of the fountains! :) it was nice being in the corner, we had a little bit pf privacy. the setting was so romantic, especially with the view of the sun setting and the bellagio fountains dancing.\n\nwe sat down and started going through the food menu and the wine list. it was so hard picking out the wine since they had a massive list. my husband and i ended up getting 2 different ones. a glass of ros\\u00e9 wine for me and a half bottle of red wine for him (can't remember exactly what the varieties were). for our starters, i got the corn soup and my husband got the smoked salmon. we got the muscovy duck and the <mark>Prime Aged New York Steak</mark> for our main course. then we got two souffl\\u00e9s to mix and share, as per our server's suggestion. we had the grand marnier and chocolate-- they were to die for! everything we had turned out to be very, very good!\n\nalso our server, joshua (i hope i got his name right), was wonderful! even after devouring our desserts, he even offered us some petit fours. wish i could take all of their salted caramels! lol they were so good... best i ever had so far.\n\nwe were very satisfied with everything and left the restaurant with very happy tummies! we'll definitely go back again in the future! :)", 
            "woohoo! as good as it gets!\n\nto this establishment, first and foremost: thank you.  i had a special occasion that i wished to more than just celebrate -- i wanted to honor it.  through every aspect within their power, their execution was flawless.\n\nit all started with communicating my intentions to one of the managers, whose information i took from prior review responses.  i figured if someone cared enough to write back to people, they might be the right sort to handle my requests with care.  i couldn't have been more right.  laurent ertle is the man i owe the uncanny success of the following.\n\nthrough him, his suggestions, and his staff, when the night came, everything flowed effortlessly.  we pre-arranged the time and table to have, in my opinion, the best seats in the house.  the view and progression of the evening was marvelous.  a prepayment plan was set in place to avoid that awkward distraction at the end of the evening.  i was even granted the appropriate menus and floral piece for the table.\n\nafter the warm welcome to our seats, the evening began with a cocktail.  expressing an interest in st. germain, our server when to ask the bar on specialties.  what returned was their version of a french 75.  a delightfully fragrant, subtly sweet, and slightly strong drink -- the perfect definition of a cocktail.\n\nshortly thereafter, we were given a choice of bread to have.  while normally i would have picked a different bread to try each time around, i just couldn't get past having more of the wonderful french baguette -- rightfully so, considering the venue.  then we were given a sample of gazpacho.  it was creamy and smooth being watery in neither flavor nor texture.  thus it was obvious to me that the selection of vegetables, spices, and method was very deliberate.  to follow was an amuse bouche.  i had to ask the waiter twice what the trio was, and i still unfortunately forgot what they were exactly.  so instead of exact, i'll be broad: one was a fluffy, rich cheese-pastry; second was an oyster topped with caviar on a bed of black pepper and sea-salt; third was a mini quiche looking bite.  it succeeded in spurring my appetite for more.  for appetizers we ordered a corn soup and roasted <mark>Muscovy Duck Breast, Camargue Rice, Pistachio, Sauce Foie Gras</mark>.  the soup was the result of for some inexplicable reason that they don't serve french onion soup, which i would have considered a given.  simple and tasty the soup was with a good marrying of ripe corn and hints of bacon.  the <mark>Muscovy Duck Breast, Camargue Rice, Pistachio, Sauce Foie Gras</mark> was luxuriously rich, and smartly paired with grapes and crisps for palate contrast and cleansing.\n\nour main courses were the <mark>Prime Aged New York Steak</mark> and <mark>Broiled 22 oz. Bone-in Ribeye, Roasted Bone Marrow</mark> in a cabernet reduction as well as a beef wellington with <mark>Individual Eiffel Tower Beef Wellington, Sauteed Snap Peas</mark>.  i will say that my definition of medium-rare must differ from the kitchen's, but it's typically against my principles to argue with a chef's execution unless gross malpractice has occurred.  after just one bite, i forgot about any disagreement i might have had.  i was reminded that the quality of cut and preparation is at least as important as the method.  the marrow and reduction added a level of depth new to me with such a course.  the complex flavors still make me salivate at the mere memory of them.  the wellington was flawless in every way -- from presentation to indulgence.  the pastry shell advertised the culinary art contained.  it was flaky and refined.  inside was a wonderfully tender, and expertly cooked, cut of beef.  more-so this course, i very easily would recommend it to anyone.\n\ndesert was a pair of souffles, that have to be ordered at the very beginning due to their complexity.  we had a gran marnier and pistachio.  both light and delicious, which was the point of getting two.  i have to say i preferred the pistachio, but that is far from an easy decision to make -- i had to compare one to the other exhaustively.  the petit fours were simple treats of milk chocolate, fudge, white chocolate, or mango.  they definitely were unimpressive, but that's what happens when everything else was so far above standard.\n\ni had asked the photographer to return so that our photo would take place with the night lights of the bellagio fountains.  not only did she, but she was enough of a perfectionist to wait for the exact right moment of the fountain show to snap the moment.  she also had our finished photo to us in what seemed like no time at all.\n\na special note must be given to the server, mario.  not to be confused with the waiter (which for the first time for me, was not the same person).  he was an absolute pleasure to have around.  he was not only prompt and courteous in profession, but also charming and humorous in conversation.  it was the type of thing that beside all the foreign luxury we were surrounded in, there still was a sense of reality to ground the experience in memory instead of fantasy.\n\ni was denied the tower ride due to mother nature, but hopefully that will also encourage me to return again to at least shake laurent ertle's hand.", 
            "food heaven. we celebrated a late valentine's day dinner here and it was well worth the wait and the 3,000 miles traveled! \n\nwe had a fantastic view of the bellagio fountains, great service and extremely delectable entrees. maine lobster salad, <mark>Prime Aged New York Steak</mark>, beef wellington and various side dishes. their caramel souffle is must have. \n\nto address the reviews that said portions were small - our portions were more than sufficient and perhaps you attended one too many buffets. \n\nwe will definitely be back again when we return to vegas!", 
            "i have to admit that i was ready for cheese, and not the classy fromage, french kind of way. however, there was nothing in the least bit tacky or cheesy about the eiffel tower restaurant.\n\nthe elevator ride to the restaurant builds anticipation and a pristine, gorgeous open kitchen done up in white and copper greets you as you step off the elevator. delicious smells and pastries on display hint at a delectable meal to come.\n\nthe atmosphere is perfect-moody reds and low lighting with spectacular views of the strip. making a 5pm reservation guarantees a table near the windows, and the view of the bellagio fountains doing their choreographed dance was a reward for eating on the senior schedule (though the 5pm timing did work perfectly in that it allowed for us to make le rev at 7pm at the wynn without breaking a sweat). seeing the fountains from above, in my opinion, was even more impressive as one could perceive the pattern of their movement in a different way.\n\nthe service was also stellar. our waiter was attentive and present without being distracting or overbearing. he asked immediately if we had time constraints and worked to get us out with plenty of time, offering the souffle up front to ensure it was ready on time (i imagine they do this across the board, but i was psyched that he asked because i would have otherwise).\n\nand the food....oh, the food! i typically do not eat much bread (nutritionist, endurance events, blah blah), but the baguette was well worth the splurge. it was just the right amount of sweet, was perfectly soft and yet flaky all at once. i'm not sure i've had better bread in france! the hubby, who is typically even more nutrition conscious than i am, had two slices!\n\ni had the <mark>Prime Aged New York Steak</mark> and would have eaten every last bite, were i not saving room for dessert. it was the most perfect medium-well i've ever had, and the <mark>Rossini Style <mark>'The King' <mark>'The Queen' Broiled Beef Tenderloin Filet Mignon</mark></mark>, Foie Gras, Truffle Sauce</mark> made it all the more delicious. i also sampled the crispy potatoes and the brussels sprouts. we joked that the potatoes we \"tots for grownups\" as they had a perfectly crispy shell but were the consistency of mashed potatoes inside. we may or may not have fought over the last one.the brussels sprouts, while not gaining points for health due to the fact that they are sauteed and served with bacon, were magically delicious. \n\nthe souffle was also perfect. we went with pistachio, which is certainly an unconventional choice, but it was remarkable. the nutty flavor of the pistachio balanced out the sweetness of the souffle. the eiffel tower restaurant is certainly a slice of la bonne vie.\n\none item to note: if you're male, make sure you're wearing a collared shirt. i had a great time picking on my husband who elected to wear a swanky sweater without a collared shirt and was asked to borrow a jacket to wear.", 
            "i considered a single star for this review but i feel that yelp is often drowning in hyperbole. if the collective internet beats its chest and hoots about how ever little moment is the \"best\" and \"worst\" then the praise and admonition lose their value so i will simply start with this; our dinner at eiffel tower on saturday was a tremendous disappointment and we will not return.\n\ndinner started well enough. we were seated at a lovely two top which offered a view of sunset playing out over the bellagio's fountain and the visually arresting architecture of city center. the ambiance of eiffel tower itself was lovely and made clear that wasn't just a window to look out! we should expect great things! these expectations went unmet.\n\ndinner started well enough a cucumber palette cleanser and cold <mark>Muscovy Duck Breast, Camargue Rice, Pistachio, Sauce Foie Gras</mark> torchon. then our entr\\u00e9es arrived and things went down hill fast. i tucked into my rabbit to find the preparation unengaging, bland and forgettable. there was nothing about it that made clear why lapin is a cornerstone of classic french cuisine. as our appetizer, ambiance and service thus far had been good i was prepared to work through my concerns. then my wife cut into her filet. a steak ordered medium rare was served somewhere between medium well and well done. she took a bite hoping that the steak was salvageable and it wasn't. when our server returned my wife shared her concern and the server's response was to shield the steak from the sun with her hand and to tell my wife that her eyes were playing tricks on her and that this gray mass was a medium rare steak. as my wife opened her mouth to reply the server, having realized how gauche response to situation was cut my wife off and said \"unless of course you tried it. then you know it is overdone.\" my wife affirmed that this was the case. her food was taken up as i continued poking through my rabbit.\n\ni had taken the last bite of my rabbit and without a word a busser swooped onto our table and wordlessly grabbed my plate. i'd yet to even have a bite of the <mark>'Faux Gras', Abalone Mushroom, Sunchoke Puree, Spiced Apples, Wild Forest Mushrooms</mark> i'd ordered or the potatoes but the plate was snatched and gone before i could say a word. when a <mark>Prime Aged New York Steak</mark> was brought out we had to ask for fresh silver and a new plate just so i could sample the accompaniments i ordered.\n\nas our meal drew to a close and my wife and i prepared to leave the same over active busser returned to our table. his arms already full from another two top he had cleared and he began to grab our plates. he was, by the way, the third employee to step on my foot to reach over me that evening. it was obvious his arms were too full and that he was having difficulty maintaing balance in his hands as he put the last plate into his arms the whole thing gave way and he managed to drop our dishes all over my dinner jacket and slacks, covering them in potatoes. he hurriedly gathering them back up and rushed away without acknowledging the oil stain that will require dry cleaning on my jacket.\n\nmy wife and i would have asked to speak to a manager regarding dinner but we had tickets for a show at bally's and had to leave. i can't in good faith suggest this place to anyone but is suppose beth and i could have just been terribly unlucky.", 
            "i read plenty of reviews on here before finally deciding to book, i was also close to cancelling my reservation because of them but i'm glad i didn't. leading up to the reservation they send you a text message asking you to confirm. when you do they will respond and ask you if you have any preferences, whether or not you'll be celebrating anything and would like to know if you want win/champagne or even a rose on your table which is nice. the view was great, we had a half circled table facing the water show at the bellagio, the server (rebecca) was awesome, really outgoing and over all made our dining experience even better since she was personable. the food was about the best french cuisine i've ever had, i ordered a <mark>Prime Aged New York Steak</mark>, my wife got the <mark>'The King' <mark>'The Queen' Broiled Beef Tenderloin Filet Mignon</mark></mark>, of course we got the veggies and potatoes etc but what really sealed the deal for us was the caramel souffle. they also have a photographer that will take a picture at your table or with a view of outside that charges $25 for the picture (price is tacked onto your bill) so you can expect to spend close to $300 or so with a few drinks, your meal and the picture not including the tip. overall though you are paying for a really good meal and an experience which makes it all worthwhile.",

            "i heard this place was going to be one of the best places to have a romantic dinner in vegas. after having dinner there, i do not want to go back again! the service was terrible! maybe it was only us, but there were many things wrong. i have to blame most of my horrible experience on the waiter (who was the oldest man there!). he asked us in the beginning if we wanted their chocolate souffle, and told us that it would take about 30 min-1 hr to make, so he recommended us to order it in the beginning. so, we did. we waited a long time for our main entrees of salmon and <mark>'The King' <mark>'The Queen' Broiled Beef Tenderloin Filet Mignon</mark></mark>, but we didn't mind since my boyfriend and i were watching the bellagio water show almost every 15 min there. i also ordered some scallops that were pretty good for an appetizer. at any rate, a couple behind us arrived 15 min after us, but were served before us. we found out later, as they stopped to eat their food, that they received the wrong order. it was ours, since i overheard them mentioning their sides. it just happened that they ordered the same main entrees as us. the waiter brought it back to the kitchen, and later brought it out (i know it was reheated in the kitchen) and gave it to us! i know this because my dish was overcooked and my side was on my plate! horrible! \n\nnot only did they get our main entrees wrong, but the dessert didn't come until an hour after our main entree was finished! the waiter kept telling us it would be coming out, and blamed that the oven was broken (when in reality....he forgot that we ordered it!). \n\nthere was nothing really special about the dishes. i definitely would not go back there again, especially if that waiter is there! i know this restaurant has a long waiting list, but it was not worth the wait in the end.", 
            "okay, i just have to say that if anyone gave this restaurant less than 5 stars then that is because they were in the casino gambling and were depressed because they lost the money that they were going to use on dinner. lol :) \nthis is my absolutely positively favorite place to have dinner in the united states! (sorry, the restaurant in the real paris are to die for and no comparison but let's focus on u.s.)\nevery time i fly to vegas i just have to have dinner here. we definitely get the royal treatment. the view is stunning. if you make reservations around 530pm, hope that they seat you at the window and you can watch the sun setting while the water show is playing at the bellagio and sipping on some wine. the wine is a bit pricey, but they have some reasonably priced bottles. (look for justin's vineyard from paso robles-cabernet sauvignon) i think is was about 60 bucks (grt price for that particular restaurant) and the wine is excellent. \ntry the <mark>'The King' <mark>'The Queen' Broiled Beef Tenderloin Filet Mignon</mark></mark> and the asparagus in a carmelized butter sauce. ok, i am getting hungry now.",

            "this really has to be one of the best restaurants in vegas not only for the food but also for the great view. i've had the pleasure of dining here twice. and because i had such a great experience the first time i recommended that we go back again for a great dining experience. like in true vegas fashion dinner was about 2hrs + long. this is not a bad thing i'm just not used to sitting for so long for dinner, being from nyc. \n\ni love french food, most people don't. i really don't know why. i ordered the <mark>'The King' <mark>'The Queen' Broiled Beef Tenderloin Filet Mignon</mark></mark> with bearnaise sauce that was great, another dish ordered at my table was the vegetarian crepes and the salmon or artic char (can't remember). i have to say that we all enjoyed our meal, and if we were not rushing over to see le reve we probably would have sat a bit longer and ordered dessert. \nthe service here was top notch and the ambiance is great too. its a bit of an older sophisticated crowd (40+) but that doesn't bother me because that usually means the food is great. the decor here is very art deco paris posh, with the blush burgundy booths. this restaurant does remind me of the jules vernes restaurant in the real et(i think that's what its called) but this one has a more comfy yet elegant feel to the more sleek and modern look. \n\nif you enjoy french food, a great view and the bellagio water show this is the place to go. \n\ni l", 
            "simply delicious.  \n\ni've been to quite a few steakhouse restaurants and this was by far beyond my expectations.  \n\nambiance:  i would recommend making your reservations between 6-8pm...that way you can enjoy the sunset and the water show with the proper lighting.  we snagged a seat around 7pm right next to the window and were able to enjoy both.  our waiter, a portly man with a great sense of humor and a \"furanch\" accent, was very pleasant and helped set the mood for a night of french cuisine.\n\ngrub:  the steak was \"melt in your mouth\" delicious.  if you go with the <mark>'The King' <mark>'The Queen' Broiled Beef Tenderloin Filet Mignon</mark></mark>- medium rare, there is no going wrong.  mmm...we still talk about that steak to this day.  the appetizers left a little more to be desired...we ordered the duck patte.  this was probably not the best choice considering the price.  it was...an acquired taste... one that probably should not have cost so much to be acquired.  \n\nservice:  at the end of the night, we were offered dessert and found ourselves too full to order.  however, the waiter returned anyways with a plate of delicious sugar cookies on the house!  that alone deserves a full star.  =)\n\nprice:  our bill came out to about $195 that night including tip but well worth it in my opinion.  i think on the next shot, we might pass on the appetizers and shoot for the <mark>'The King' <mark>'The Queen' Broiled Beef Tenderloin Filet Mignon</mark></mark> only.  \n\nall in all:   simply delicious!!!", 
            "by far one of the best places to go in vegas!  the views of bellagio and the strip was awesome!  the food was great, and the service was superb!\n     definitely a good idea to make reservations, this place gets packed!  we started off with the cold foie geas and blue cheese souffle, both were decent but not outstanding.  the blue cheese souffle reminded me of bread pudding, it tasted okay but wasnt anything special.  the cold <mark>Muscovy Duck Breast, Camargue Rice, Pistachio, Sauce Foie Gras</mark> was a tad salty even with bread, i think the seared <mark>Muscovy Duck Breast, Camargue Rice, Pistachio, Sauce Foie Gras</mark> might have tasted better.   the bread selection was good, i liked the french baguette.  our bread came out cold, so the waiter gladly brought us hot bread on the spot!  \n     my friends ordered entrees of salmon, sea bass, duck breast, and lamb chops.  the seafood dishes were okay, nothing to rave about.  the grilled duck breast was excellent!  the grilled lamb chops were by far the best ive ever had!  it came out tender, juicy, and had no gamey flavor at all!  it had the texture of a <mark>'The King' <mark>'The Queen' Broiled Beef Tenderloin Filet Mignon</mark></mark> and taste of a prime rib, which was quite unique...definitely a great entree!  \n     we ordered two souffles, a pistachio and banana nut...both were great!  the souffles came out hot, super light, perfect texture..by far the best souffles ive ever had!  the banana nut tasted excellent!  the pistachio souffle was also unique, both were very tasty!  i'd come back here just for the souffles..and they are so light that you can eat two of them by yourself!\n    overall, the service here is excellent, all the waiters are super nice and constantly check up to make sure everything is satisfying.  the food was perfect, but the portions were on the small side.  the souffles are amazing, definitely a must-have!  prices here a little high, especially for such small portions, but everything was cooked perfect and presented nicely!  this would be a perfect spot to take a date, nice cozy and dimly lit place with a romantic feel, and great views of the strip, including the bellagio water show.", 
            "it's too bad i can't give them like 5 more stars but know that they deserve it!!! we went for dinner... i got the lamb that was so tender and moist i wanted to cry. my grandma got the <mark>'The King' <mark>'The Queen' Broiled Beef Tenderloin Filet Mignon</mark></mark> omgosh so perfect. we also ordered a side of creamed spinach.. which i was against because of what other restaurants spinach dips were like (too creamy) but oh my god.. their creamed spinach was so light and so delicious. needless to say.. we loved it so much that the price didn't bother to us. the view was so beautiful especially sitting right in front of the bellagio and watching the watershow.. was unforgettable and amazing to experience. other info~~~ bread was so.. perfect and perfect! souffle was.. delish.. but don't get the caramel (i got that and regretted it) my dad got the chocolate which was sooooooooooo good~! and my grandma got the pistachio which was eh~ and don't spill anything! because even a bread crumb will have your server coming to swipe it with a silver scooper thing. my brother spilled the creamed spinach and our server had to scrape that off too before my brother even got to eat it. they also give you new utensils for each course. omgosh omgosh one more thing.. i almost never eat butter or margarine unless it's made with a dish. but i just spread a hint of their butter on my french baguette and ended up eating half of the butter square which was huge. so light and perfect just the way i like it.\n\nat the end of our meal, we didn't even feel full. the portions were just right, but if you're looking for a hearty meal like my younger brother.. do what he did and get yourself a pan of pizza afterwards!\n\ni have pictures.. will upload asap~!", 
            "my first experience here with my family was awesome. it was a nice surprise for us to see the kitchen when we got out of the elevator. we got to see that they were diligently preparing the food. our waiter was very attentive and helpful. he answered all our questions and gave us good recommendations. \n\nwe ordered shrimp spaghetti veggies salad, slow-roasted filet atlantic salmon with <mark>Slow Roasted Filet of Pacific Salmon, Pinot Noir Sauce</mark>, roasted semi-boneless chicken with butternut squash, and char <mark>'The King' <mark>'The Queen' Broiled Beef Tenderloin Filet Mignon</mark></mark> with red wine sauce. we ended up trying each other dishes since all the food looked so yummy. the salad came with 6-7 jumbo shrimps! the salad tasted light and healthy. my salmon dish came out to be perfect. it smelled great and tasted soft and amazing with the <mark>Slow Roasted Filet of Pacific Salmon, Pinot Noir Sauce</mark>. the chicken came out to be the biggest portion out of all our dishes. it tasted differently from the typical marinated chicken we usually ate. although it was smallest portion, the steak turned out to be excellent. it was medium-rare cooked. it tasted tender and juicy with the red wine sauce. for dessert, we had the banana souffle. it's the best i've tasted!!! highly recommended!!! our bill came out to be almost $400...it was because we also ordered wine and cocktails.\n\noverall the atmosphere was very cozy and romantic. they have a gorgeous view, and the restaurant itself is nicely decorated. great service throughout the dinner. two reasons i didn't give it 5 stars: 1) food and drinks a bit overpriced 2) small food portion.\n\nmy tips:\n\n1) make a reservation, so you don't have to wait. (you can't request sitting arrangement, i tried)\n\n2) though you don't have to dress-up nicely, i recommend it so you can take pics. plus it's fun dressing up. :d (those who worry about dress code, yes you can wear jeans, but wear it with a nice top and you should be good.)\n\n3) bring a camera, so you can take lots of pics!! (ladies- when you visit the restroom, take your camera with you. it has a nice arrangement. ;p)\n\n4) for those who worry about $$$ and not being full enough, i highly recommend you to eat a big lunch first. if you're going with a partner, you can always order one meal and share. another option is you can always eat dinner somewhere else first, and then stop by this restaurant to enjoy some desserts instead. you can never go wrong with desserts. (kids not recommended because they might not enjoy/like the fancy food. plus i don't remember seeing a kid's menu)\n\n5) i recommend going with a date since the setting is very romantic at night, and you would have a better chance of sitting by the window where you can see the gorgeous view and the bellagio's water show rather than with a big group.\n\nenjoy your food!", 
            "we had the best time here. great food great service and a killer view. we made reservations at least 2 weeks before and we waited a little longer for a table by the window so we could watch the bellagio fountains totally worth it!  a bit pricey but hello dont forget your in effing vegas. best items i tried were the seared scallops and the crab stuffed <mark>'The King' <mark>'The Queen' Broiled Beef Tenderloin Filet Mignon</mark></mark>. the sides arent so spectac so id probably skip that next time. but overall a fab experience",

            "what an outstanding experience!  from the moment we entered the restaurant via the dedicated elevator to the moment we left we were fully attended. our waiter was always there and never went mia. the wine list was a bit intimidating, given the amazing high-end wines comprising their cellar, but we were able to tell the waiter our preferences and price point, and not only did he gladly made a recommendation, but he verified that choice with the sommelier and came back with a different option, which was outstanding. \n\ni had the beef wellington, and my wife had the <mark>'The King' <mark>'The Queen' Broiled Beef Tenderloin Filet Mignon</mark></mark> with berneaise sauce. both were outstanding. we further finished the meal with souffles, mine pistachio and hers caramel. again both terrific. \n\nin addition to the great food and service, the view is spectacular. we had a window table overlooking the bellagio fountains, which was an amazing addition to the already spectacular experience.",

            "we were told by several people this is the best place to eat in vegas.  we were sat at a window seat overlooking the bellagio's famous fountain.  that was the best part of our meal, sad to say.  the view was stunning, but the food left us disappointed.  for the price, we expected everything to be excellent.  my drink was the second best part of the meal.  i had the eiffel tower (something-or-another.)  it was like a light champagne version of sangria with mixed berries.  my husband had the beef wellington, and it was just ok.  i had the <mark>'The King' <mark>'The Queen' Broiled Beef Tenderloin Filet Mignon</mark></mark>, and it was tough, dry, and overcooked.  i asked for it medium, so i was really disappointed with it and didn't even finish it.  for a $69 steak, that is not good.  i've had better at longhorn steakhouse.  maybe we ordered the wrong items, but everything should be good at a place like this.", 
            "my husband and i dined here the other night to celebrate my birthday and what a great experience it was! i had called about a week in advance to make a reservation. to my surprise, they asked for my credit card number over the phone, which i have never done before. this guarantees your reservation, and if you cancel i believe they charge $50 to your card. a dress code is also enforced, although the woman i spoke to over the phone told me that jeans are allowed as long as they are not ripped up. \n\nas others have already mentioned, you take the (small) elevator to the 11th floor where the restaurant is located. the elevator opens up in front of the kitchen. as soon as we arrived, one of the employees said \"what are you doing in the kitchen?\" he then gave us a warm greeting and walked us to where we would check in. \n\nwe had a great table by the window with a awesome view! my husband and i thought the restaurant would be higher up than it actually was, but it was perfect! we really enjoyed the view of the bellagio fountains (every 15 minutes) and the strip. \n\nwhat we ordered for dinner:\n-maine peekey toe crab salad: with cucumber and black sesame seeds. very light and tasty with a vinaigrette type of dressing. good choice for an appetizer!\n\n-char <mark>'The King' <mark>'The Queen' Broiled Beef Tenderloin Filet Mignon</mark></mark>: with lemon parsley butter. it was cooked the way i wanted and easy to cut into pieces. it wasn't the best steak i have ever eaten, but i still enjoyed it. i also felt that the butter was too thick and it took a while to melt down. \n\n-<mark>Prime Aged New York Steak</mark>: my husband ordered this. he pretty much felt the same way i did about my steak. it was good, but definitely not the best.\n\n-<mark>Galette of Potato Anna</mark>: as our side order. it was basically thinly sliced potatoes that were layered on a plate. not much to say about it, but there's nothing wrong with potatoes cooked with butter!\n\nfor dessert:\n-chocolate souffle: after we ordered our dinner, our server asked us if we wanted to order a souffle because it takes about 30 minutes for them to prepare it. it was interesting when they brought it to our table. first they make a hole in the center of the souffle, then they pour in the chocolate sauce inside. i was a bit disappointed because it wasn't as good as i was hoping it to be. the cake was very moist and fluffy, but i felt that it needed more chocolate sauce.\n\n-i was surprised with a complimentary chocolate mousse for my birthday! it tasted great and i definitely enjoyed it more than the chocolate souffle! i also liked how they served it on a plate with \"happy birthday\" written in chocolate sauce!\n\nservice was top notch! our server was pierre. he was friendly, entertaining, and very attentive. he made us laugh, smile, and really wanted us to enjoy our dinner! also there is a photographer that walks around asking if you would like to take a picture with the illuminated paris balloon in the background. we decided why not, and liked how it came out. we paid $24 for a 5x7 photo. ouch. i know, but it was worth it for us!\n\nmy only complaint is that the tables are packed in very close together. the aisles are also very narrow, so it takes a while to pass by other tables and to get out. \n\nour bill was expensive! but we definitely enjoyed the experience and our night here! hopefully the food will be better the second time around if we ever come back!", 
            "my wife and i used to make the eiffel tower restaurant an annual event but we had not been back for a couple of years. i'm glad we decided to go back.\n\nas in the past, the atmosphere is vibrant and polished. i always wear a jacket but there are some without. business casual is fine. you should expect to spend 2 - 3 hours for dinner here but the server will ask you if you have a show or event to attend later in the evening to help you get out in time. do make a point to arrive early and have a drink at their bar. the view from bar (and the entire restaurant) is awesome. \n\nonly negative- i was told that we could only get a table at the window facing the bellagio fountains if we were seated as 2. we were 4 so we settled for a table on the second tier but saw some of the bellagio show. i was distressed, however, to see some tables for 3 and 4 set up in that first tier to see the bellagio show as they dinned. i guess i didn't speak to the right person when i made my reservation.\n\nmy smoked salmon starter was outstanding. as in our past visits, my wife and i had the <mark>'The King' <mark>'The Queen' Broiled Beef Tenderloin Filet Mignon</mark></mark>. and as in the past it is the best filet i have ever had. instead of going to one of the many steak houses on the strip, save your steak night for eiffel tower and order the filet. you will not be disappointed. \n\nyes, of course, we had to order their famous souffles. we ordered the chocolate with chocolate sauce and, as a twist, chocolate with banana sauce. you cannot order incorrectly whatever flavor you order. don't worry about the flavor-just order it! everyone also get a a small tray of sweets to end the meal.\n\ntheir wine list is extensive and the sommelier will help you if you are not used to ordering french wines. the service was attentive and knowledgeable.\n\nit is pricey, but worth it. save this place for you big night out and you will remember it for a long time.\n\ni only go back to restaurants if they earn it. eiffel tower restaurant earns it year after year.",

            "my girlfriend and i just so happened to be in vegas at the one year, eight month mark in our relationship. we were originally planning to get dinner at some cheesecake factory-esque restaurant, but when we were walking around paris, we decided to go with eiffel tower restaurant to make it a memorable night.\n\nwe were in town because she had a singing competition at planet hollywood. it ran longer than we thought, and in the process i had to push back our 9:35 reservation at the last minute. the staff was very accommodating and understanding, and i really appreciated that. when we arrived ten minutes late, i showed up in a t-shirt and shorts, which, in my defense, was comfortable attire for attending a competition! but of course, not acceptable for a nice, fancy dinner. definitely my bad! so we speed-walked back to bally's so i could change into my collared shirt and dress pants. ended up arriving at around 10:10. big props goes to the staff of eiffel tower for dealing with my follies in such a patient, professional manner!\n\nnow for dinner, we had a beautiful view of the strip and bellagio's beautiful fountain show in front of us. that alone was pretty memorable. we were treated very well by the staff, who offered us bread on a nice platter, giving us the option to choose which type of bread we wanted. before our food was served, we were offered a nice sampling of asparagus soup, which was creamy and delicious. \n\nfor our entrees, she ordered the vegetarian option, the baked herbed crepes while i ordered the beef wellington which came with a nice wine sauce on the side. overall the food was good, and having never had a <mark>'The King' <mark>'The Queen' Broiled Beef Tenderloin Filet Mignon</mark></mark> baked into a pastry, it was pretty interesting -- in a good way! the wine sauce gave the dish a distinctive sweet, defined taste. my girlfriend's crepes were pretty good too, from what she let me sample... haha.\n\nour dessert was the yelp-recommended pistachio souffl\\u00e9, which was nice and delicate. we were also given a choice of chocolates from a platter to round out the night. a nice shout-out goes to reed, our amazing and efficient server for contributing to an wonderful and memorable dinner experience. will definitely be back again, and will be recommending this place to family and friends. thanks, eiffel tower restaurant, for giving my girlfriend and i a great memory!", 
            "this place was recommended to me by a friend the first time i went to vegas and was not able to go. on my recent trip to vegas i definitely had to go. we made our reservations for dinner early while we strolled through the casino. the woman made it very clear that there was a dress code. we arrived for dinner 30 minutes before our reservation but were seated anyways. i couldn't believe the view its breath taking. between all the vegas lights and the bellagio fountain show about every half hour i was mesmerized. when the menu came i was very intimidated and surprised at how small it was. the prices were very up there. this is the most expensive restaurant i have ever been to in my whole entire life i'm not much of a food critic. i ordered the <mark>'The King' <mark>'The Queen' Broiled Beef Tenderloin Filet Mignon</mark></mark> in the b\\u00e9arnaise sauce with the <mark>Gratinee Creamed Spinach and Mushroom</mark>, the waiter did an excellent job answering my questions and helping me choose a wine. my boyfriend ordered the flatiron steak. we received an asparagus mousse compliments of the chef which i thought was very sweet i'm not sure if they do this for everyone. the food is a decent amount and all of it was delicious nothing out of this world though. i recommend it for a romantic intimate dinner a man even proposed to his wife while we were there (she said yes) it really was one of the most amazing views. the check came out to about $200 including tip. for the money i feel like we could've gone to another swanky vegas restaurant and gotten a better dinner but it's just one of those things you have to experience. i was scared of a snotty establishment but the staff were all sweet and helpful.",

            "i took my husband and some of his family here for a reunion meal, and everyone loved the experience.  laurent, the restaurant manager whom i contacted by email before our visit, ensured that we had a fabulous window table with an awesome view of the bellagio fountains.  our wait staff gave us attentive, patient service.  and the chefs provided delicious meals.  my husband deemed his salmon with <mark>Slow Roasted Filet of Pacific Salmon, Pinot Noir Sauce</mark> \"the best salmon ever.\"  i was a huge fan of the grand marnier souffle and the expensive ($18) specialty cocktails.  our four guests ordered versions of the <mark>'The King' <mark>'The Queen' Broiled Beef Tenderloin Filet Mignon</mark></mark>, and all seemed pleased except for the one who ordered her filet medium well (it was more well done, and therefore tougher, than she had expected it to be).  all of the sides (<mark>Classic Potato Gratin</mark>, green beans, brussels sprouts, <mark>Gratinee Creamed Spinach and Mushroom</mark> spaetzle) were tasty.  the maine lobster salad was very good, though it's worth noting that it contained far less kale than i had expected, just a little taste rather than salad-like greens.  the meal was, of course, seriously expensive ($717 for the six of us, including tax and the mandatory 18% gratuity (the gratuity was, i assume, mandatory because we were a larger group)).  we knew that going in (the menu, with prices, is available on the restaurant's website), however, so we were not unpleasantly surprised.  if you can afford to ignore the cost, eating at the eiffel tower restaurant at paris las vegas is a fun, tasty, memorable experience (the views truly are unforgettable).",

            "the eiffel tower restaurant is a place to come for the amazing atmosphere of eating in the eiffel tower overlooking the las vegas strip and not necessarily the food. me and my three friends made reservations for a monday night at around 6pm on 2/11/13. when we got up there, you have to take the elevator up to the restaurant, then walk through their kitchen area, which is really neat to see. they gave us a side view of the bellagio fountains and the rest of the strip (which is an amazing view). it is a very classy place, and they serve you multiple choice of bread which are all excellent. it's a pricy place, but no pricer than your going to get anywhere else on the strip. i got the <mark>'The King' <mark>'The Queen' Broiled Beef Tenderloin Filet Mignon</mark></mark> with b\\u00e9arnaise sauce, which was very good, just not great. also got the caesar salad, however, the dressing tasted 100% oil, and not like caesar at all, which was probably my least favorite thing here. also got a apple strudel dessert which was very flavorful with cinnamon sugar and nice flaky crust. \n\npros\n*atmosphere - #1 reason to come here. might be the nicest place to dine in the heart of the strip. at night it's beautiful because not only do you get a great view of the bellagio fountains, but the strip in general. \n\n*service - i really enjoyed how it felt like we didn't have a waiter, but we had a host. everyone was really nice and very accommodating. the waitress always came over and refilled our water glasses and they constantly asked us if we wanted more of that fresh bread. \n\ncons\n*food - food is still really good, just nothing amazing to the point i was blown away. i personally think ruth's chris or morton's food is better than here.\n\n*price - not outrageous for las vegas, but still a pricy place. for a caesar salad, <mark>'The King' <mark>'The Queen' Broiled Beef Tenderloin Filet Mignon</mark></mark>, and a dessert cost me in the neighborhood of $100.",

            "it's no secret that this place is good. i wouldn't expect anything less. \n\nfrom the moment your brought up in the elevator to the moment you head back to the hustle and bustle of the casino, you definitely are living an experience. \n\nlow lighting and a view that can't be beat, fine linens, and wait staff who attend to your every need, the eiffel tower is first class all the way. \n\ni selected their smoked salmon to start and i have never had a better piece of fish. smooth, thinly sliced, and melt in your mouth buttery taste accompanied the onion, capers, and creme fraiche (not sure of my french spelling here) with several slices of perfectly toasted bread. i could have eaten a second plate and called it a meal. the capers were surprisingly delicious - not the over salted from a jar variety. \n\nmost of us selected their <mark>'The King' <mark>'The Queen' Broiled Beef Tenderloin Filet Mignon</mark></mark>, with several different toppings to choose from. i couldn't resist and chose the decadent bernaise sauce. the steak itself was cooked to perfection and the interior was almost as buttery smooth as the sauce itself. there were a ton of sides passed around our table, but the winners were the potatoes gratin (perfect in their simplicity) and the mushroom sp\\u00e4tzle (yes they eat german food in parts of france). \n\ndesserts probably deserve their own review, but to put it simply; save room and order a bunch to taste and share. the chocolate plate will leave any chocoholic in heaven. \n\npricey, but worth every penny.",

            "came here with five other people. we all enjoyed but were not blown away with the restaurant, so i gave it four stars.\n\nfirstly, the view is beautiful. maybe come here on one of your first nights in las vegas, especially if you are not staying in or near the bellagio/paris (we stayed in the paris hotel). if you are always around the fountains, they do get old after awhile. but then again, it's a different, more grand vantage point to enjoy them from.\n\nwe didn't take advantage but if you have an early 5:00 pm dinner, they will seat you at a window immediately. this is probably because las vegas diners come out pretty late for dinner and dining rooms are pretty empty until 7 p.m. hits.\n\nthe service is not particularly friendly, but i'm never really impressed by overly enthusiastic waiters anyway, so that was fine by me. one exception was the server who came around with bread. he was so enthusiastic about his bread. lol. great guy. \n\nmy husband and i both had the <mark>'The King' <mark>'The Queen' Broiled Beef Tenderloin Filet Mignon</mark></mark> with <mark>Rossini Style <mark>'The King' <mark>'The Queen' Broiled Beef Tenderloin Filet Mignon</mark></mark>, Foie Gras, Truffle Sauce</mark>. it arrived...warmish, not hot. we had to remind the server we also had the <mark>Rossini Style <mark>'The King' <mark>'The Queen' Broiled Beef Tenderloin Filet Mignon</mark></mark>, Foie Gras, Truffle Sauce</mark>, which came in a separate sauce boat. it arrived after the reminder. and we also didn't get proper steak knifes, which took away from the experience a little bit. \n\nthe other people at the table liked their dishes, the bread, etc. my father in law ordered the veal medallions but a big hunk of lamb chop was placed in front of him. he alerted the server to the error but the server tried to pass off the lamb chop as \"better\" and acted surprised when my fil still insisted on the veal medallions. that was odd. he later apologized for the mistake but it was still an odd way to handle the situation.\n\nwe ordered dessert souffles (caramel for hubby and i, strawberry for the other two couples) and it was a truly exceptional souffl\\u00e9 which made up for the other mistakes at the meal. i would highly recommend!\n\nthe mistakes not withstanding, the restaurant is great for a romantic dinner. it could use a little more polish considering the pricing, but the ambiance makes up for all of that.",

Bone-in Ribeye, Roasted Bone Marrow</mark> sauce on top. seriously the best steak i've ever eaten in my life. it may have been the best meal i've ever had in my life. it was juicy and flavorful, perfectly cooked. my husband had a <mark>'The King' <mark>'The Queen' Broiled Beef Tenderloin Filet Mignon</mark></mark> with <mark>Muscovy Duck Breast, Camargue Rice, Pistachio, Sauce Foie Gras</mark> w/truffle oil. he raved about his meal too (i thought mine was better though).\n\nall in all, the service got a dismal tip (my husband wrote a note on the receipt) but the meal was amazing and memorable!",

            "i have to admit that i was ready for cheese, and not the classy fromage, french kind of way. however, there was nothing in the least bit tacky or cheesy about the eiffel tower restaurant.\n\nthe elevator ride to the restaurant builds anticipation and a pristine, gorgeous open kitchen done up in white and copper greets you as you step off the elevator. delicious smells and pastries on display hint at a delectable meal to come.\n\nthe atmosphere is perfect-moody reds and low lighting with spectacular views of the strip. making a 5pm reservation guarantees a table near the windows, and the view of the bellagio fountains doing their choreographed dance was a reward for eating on the senior schedule (though the 5pm timing did work perfectly in that it allowed for us to make le rev at 7pm at the wynn without breaking a sweat). seeing the fountains from above, in my opinion, was even more impressive as one could perceive the pattern of their movement in a different way.\n\nthe service was also stellar. our waiter was attentive and present without being distracting or overbearing. he asked immediately if we had time constraints and worked to get us out with plenty of time, offering the souffle up front to ensure it was ready on time (i imagine they do this across the board, but i was psyched that he asked because i would have otherwise).\n\nand the food....oh, the food! i typically do not eat much bread (nutritionist, endurance events, blah blah), but the baguette was well worth the splurge. it was just the right amount of sweet, was perfectly soft and yet flaky all at once. i'm not sure i've had better bread in france! the hubby, who is typically even more nutrition conscious than i am, had two slices!\n\ni had the <mark>Prime Aged New York Steak</mark> and would have eaten every last bite, were i not saving room for dessert. it was the most perfect medium-well i've ever had, and the <mark>Rossini Style <mark>'The King' <mark>'The Queen' Broiled Beef Tenderloin Filet Mignon</mark></mark>, Foie Gras, Truffle Sauce</mark> made it all the more delicious. i also sampled the crispy potatoes and the brussels sprouts. we joked that the potatoes we \"tots for grownups\" as they had a perfectly crispy shell but were the consistency of mashed potatoes inside. we may or may not have fought over the last one.the brussels sprouts, while not gaining points for health due to the fact that they are sauteed and served with bacon, were magically delicious. \n\nthe souffle was also perfect. we went with pistachio, which is certainly an unconventional choice, but it was remarkable. the nutty flavor of the pistachio balanced out the sweetness of the souffle. the eiffel tower restaurant is certainly a slice of la bonne vie.\n\none item to note: if you're male, make sure you're wearing a collared shirt. i had a great time picking on my husband who elected to wear a swanky sweater without a collared shirt and was asked to borrow a jacket to wear.", 
            "out of all the meals that i had here in vegas this was my favorite, it was my first time eating in a french restaurant. we were gonna dine at one of the most fanciest places in all of las vegas, it was me, my dad, mike and his wife martha, joe and his wife deb (joe treated everyone to dinner) and paul and his wife linda (a table of 8). located on the 11th floor of the paris, we took the elevator up and when we walked in we saw the kitchen staff hard at work preparing dinner then we saw this big extraordinary, elegant room and you get a nice view overlooking the bellagio fountains outside. \nwe sat down and while making our decisions for appetizers were treated to a lovely amuse-bouche (french for amusing the mouth, to wake up your palate, with a bite-sized appetizer) it was a shot glass filled with <mark><mark>Lemon Parsley Butter, Bearnaise, Bordelaise, Green Peppercorn, Black Truffle</mark>, Stone Ground Corn, Celery Root</mark> mousseline (mousseline is a creamy soup-like sauce when you fold whipped cream into hollandaise) it was topped with some chopped celery for some texture (a nice way to start the meal and to wake up the palate). for my appetizer i got the new york state <mark>Muscovy Duck Breast, Camargue Rice, Pistachio, Sauce Foie Gras</mark> which was sitting on a crispy alsace spice cake with quince compote and petite mache (<mark>Muscovy Duck Breast, Camargue Rice, Pistachio, Sauce Foie Gras</mark>, which is what i call meaty butter, melts in your mouth, quince a tart fruit, similar to a pear in appearance but has the similar taste and texture to an apple, spice cake was a nice crunchy little wafer spiced with cinnamon and mache a leafy green that has a nutty flavor, it was awesome). \n\nmy dad got the lobster bisque with lobster flan, celery and a brioche crouton (rich, smooth creamy soup with a flan in the center made from lobster stock, you get some crunch from the celery, and then you take a bite of that crispy brioche crouton, its spectacular). everyone else at the shared 2 different salads, the 1st one was a tuscan kale salad, door county dried cherries, cherry tomatoes, quinoa croutons, toasted pecans and finished with a balsamic vinaigrette (so much going on in that salad, crisp, earthy kale, sweetness from the cherries, tartness from the cherry tomatoes, you get crunch from both the croutons and pecans and you get acidity from the vinaigrette). the 2nd one was a non-traditional caesar salad with a dressing made from anchovies, capers and garlic (i honestly don't know what was non-traditional about that salad and i thought the dressing was a tad bit too salty for my taste). \nfor our drinks, while everyone else was mostly having red wine or chardonnay, me and martha partook in one of their signature cocktails: the eiffel affair (consisting of blueberry vodka, cr\\u00e8me de cassis, cointreau, rose nectar, some champagne for that fizzy and bubbly effect and topped off with some fresh berries). \nfor our entrees: i had the rabbit with braised carrots confit and mustard jus (my first time eating rabbit, so moist and tender like chicken, bite from the carrots and sweetness from the mustard jus, they use dijon mustard). my dad and paul had the pan seared pork chop with spiced braised apples and with a calvados sauce (juicy pork, the apples go so well with pork and the calvados sauce was sweet tasting, calvados is an apple brandy), mike got the roasted rack of lamb with tomato tart and <mark>Roasted Rack of Lamb, Tomato Tart, Tarragon Jus</mark> (the bones were beautifully frenched ), martha got the red snapper with razor clams, fingerling potatoes, tomato confit and finished with a shellfish bouillon (the fish had a nice crispy skin), deb and linda had the roasted chicken with apricot, quinoa pilaf and moroccan spices (i love roasted chicken, so flavorful). joe got the char <mark>'The King' <mark>'The Queen' Broiled Beef Tenderloin Filet Mignon</mark></mark> with a <mark>Rossini Style <mark>'The King' <mark>'The Queen' Broiled Beef Tenderloin Filet Mignon</mark></mark>, Foie Gras, Truffle Sauce</mark> (his was the most expensive).\n then we ordered dessert: i got the white chocolate banana elysee (it was named after a building in france, it was sliced bananas and white chocolate disks stacked on top of each other surrounded by a moat of a chocolate/vanilla sauce mixture and at the top there be a little ball made of caramelized sugar, normally i don't eat bananas but this was so damn good, it was the most stunning dessert i've ever eaten, it looked like a spaceship and boy did i take it to my leader, my stomach), mike and martha got the chocolate hazelnut a la parisienne with vanilla ice cream (it resembled a bear claw, mike and martha seemed to enjoy, but i thought it was bitter and after 2 bites i couldn't take anymore), joe and deb got the raspberry napoleon with a vanilla blanc manger and red fruit sorbet (stacked beautifully) and paul and linda got the classic cr\\u00e8me brulee (a bit of a clich\\u00e9). \n\neverything was amazing, but i had to delete the pictures that i took here due to the flash on my camera not working so after calling the restaurant a couple times (10) linda (one of the hostesses) and sharon (one of the general managers) were kind enough to help me out and to email me the pictures. also more thing my dad says you should adjust the lighting cuz it was very dim to him. i really had a nice time here, i'll be sure to come here again the next time i'm in vegas !!!",

            "eiffel tower is a delightful restaurant. you arrive via elevator, up through the \"eiffel tower\" structure in the middle of the paris casino complex. the elevator opens directly into the kitchen pass, which is a unique and rather cool touch i've never seen before. once you enter the dining room, a dim room with floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking the strip; you're greeted warmly. this is one of the few high-end restaurants i've visited where even a family with a small baby (admittedly a quiet, well-dressed baby) was welcomed by the hostesses. \n\nour family had made a reservation several months ago, and had specifically asked for a table near the windows. we were given a delightful 3-top with a perfect view of the bellagio fountains. our service team was quiet and well-trained, although they did not quite meet the same level of service that one experiences at twist. (no holding of chairs for ladies, etc.) my spouse suggested that i might be nit-picking when i complained that they only utilized their crumb scrapers at the end of our meal, rather than after each course. \n\nthe food itself was classical and elegant. we started our meal with a cauliflower creme, sent out by the chef as an amuse bouche. rich, \"roasty\" and delicious. my son ordered the <mark>'The King' <mark>'The Queen' Broiled Beef Tenderloin Filet Mignon</mark></mark>, which was perfectly prepared and delicious. my entree was black cod served on a bed of cauliflower couscous. the fish fell apart when i touched it with my fork- it was tender, moist and very well done. easily the best non-salmon fish entree i've ever had. my spouse ordered the wellington, which he was not thrilled with. it was prepared well and he had no specific critique...it just didn't suit him. for sides, we shared the brown butter spaetzl and the green beans. the former was delicious (if a bit on the oily side) while the latter were...just green beans. i'd suggest you be more adventurous if you dine here. \n\nfor dessert, we ordered chocolate cake and apple strudel. my spouse loved the apple dish. i found the chocolate cake to be too rich to finish; which is saying something, considering that i am a die-hard chocoholic and the portion was small. the management also sent over a lovely artists palate of assorted sorbet, with a side of berries. they explained that this was an apology for a drunken diner seated nearby that had to be asked to leave. considering that we had not even noticed an incident occurring in this very quiet dining room, i think this speaks volumes to the staffs discretion when handing front of the house issues. honestly? the sorbet (raspberry, mango, green apple, creme, and chocolate) were my favorite desserts. i would order that again in a heartbeat. \n\nin short? paris is now my second favorite las vegas restaurant (running behind twist) and is recommended, should you find yourself in that part of the country.", 
            "we celebrated a special occasion with a fantastic dinner in a front row window table overlooking the bellagio fountains. we arrived a little early for our reservation but the hostess stated our table was ready.  the wait staff was friendly and each member was attentive from the choice of breads to refilling water glasses to following up on the satisfaction of our meal.\nthe pace was unhurried and just right. \n\nthe <mark>'The King' <mark>'The Queen' Broiled Beef Tenderloin Filet Mignon</mark></mark> was cooked to perfection and delicious. we shared the <mark>Galette of Potato Anna</mark>, crispy sliced buttery potatos and the green beans almondine that was fresh and al dente. both side dishes are ample in size and perfect for sharing. the wild snapper filet had a crispy skin with a moist and tender inside. the fish was served on a bed of belgium endive along side confit orange with a bordelaise sauce. this entree was just supurb. \n\nwe were offered 3 complementry desserts. first a small chocolate mousse topped with whip cream and a slice of chocolate served on a plate with \"happy anniversary\" piped in chocolate around the rim. very smooth. the second dessert was an artist pallid with 6 different sorbets and in the center a large strawberry incased in hardened sugar. this dessert was over the top. third we were then presented with and able to choose from an assortment of petit fours. so glad we did not order dessert off the menu.\nthe entire restaurant staff contributed to making this a very special experience. with the night time view of las vegas blvd.10 stories below it was like going to the theater.  \n\nwe have been big fans of lettuce entertain you restaurants from their beginning with r.j. grunts in chicago over 40 years ago. thanks rich melman, keep the great restaurants coming.", 
            "the first time here was when my family and i moved to vegas, so it's been awhile and thought we should try this place again, so we decided to come here for new year's day dinner. i have a big family, which is great because it means there are more dishes i could try! i feel that this is a great restaurant for people who are visiting vegas, because the restaurant offers a great view of the strip, as well as, the bellagio fountain show. but if you are looking for an omg, mouth watery dishes then it's best to try other restaurants from renowned chef around the city.\ni am very pleased that the seafood platter was cook perfectly.  my duck was a bit bland to me. my brothers got steak (ribeye & <mark>'The King' <mark>'The Queen' Broiled Beef Tenderloin Filet Mignon</mark></mark>) and it was ok.\nmy dinning experience was not as great coming from a high-end restaurant. our server seemed very quick and efficient, which is good for attending to all the customers and getting everyone served. but i like it more when they take their time with you and agreeing with what you order. i felt that she was pushy to get my dad to get a side dish even though it was obvious that he didn't want any. then when my mom was next to order and she asked my dad if he got any side dishes, the waitress gave an attitude, \"i already asked him, but he didn't want any.\" when we were undecided on whether we should get one or two seafood platter, she announced over the entire table to get everyone's attention to hurriedly decide what we want. \nlastly, we opt to skip the dessert and just asked for the check and she gave a disapproving look. the restaurant was bit pricey for the food and service, but i guess you're paying for the spectacular view.", 
            "a nitty-gritty layman's guide to the eiffel tower restaurant\n\nreservations:  a must, particularly if you'd like to be seated during pique lunch or dinner hour.  if you're flexible, i.e. supper at 9:45, take a chance and walk in.\n\nattire:  business casual. (we were somewhat dressier.)  i witnessed a couple being turned away because of their jeans and tee shirts.\n\nservice:  spot on.  our server, michael, was friendly and helpful.  we never wanted for a thing.\n\nwine:  if you're a connoisseur, i suspect you'll delight in the wine list.  if you're like me, a person who appreciates a california red, but doesn't want to spend an arm and a leg, your choices are limited.  you can order shiraz at $12 a glass, or go for a bottle of rodney strong merlot @ $59, which is what we did.  over-priced, but less money than virtually everything else.  by the way, if you choose to bring your own wine, expect a ludicrous corkage fee of $75 per bottle.\n\nprix fixe: the six course tasting menu is $125 per person.  wine pairing is an additional $79 and if you'd like a souffl\\u00e9, tack on $8 more.  two things to note: 1) if one person wants the prix fixe, everyone at the table must be in accord and order the same. 2) there is no flexibility in the  menu. courses are as presented with no choice or substitutions. (based on reviews of the venison, we decided to order a la carte.)\n\nour meals\nappetizers:   of the appetizers, two were particularly good:  the casco bay sea scallops and my cold <mark>Muscovy Duck Breast, Camargue Rice, Pistachio, Sauce Foie Gras</mark> which was melt-in-your-mouth delicious.  i could have done without the accompanying <mark>Cold <mark>Muscovy Duck Breast, Camargue Rice, Pistachio, Sauce Foie Gras</mark> Torchon, Duck Prosciutto, Fig Compote</mark> or toast points.  (make your selection from the bread basket instead.)\n\nsalad: my husband and daughter ordered the market green salad, which appeared unremarkable.  better choice may be what's called the  \"non-traditional\" caesar salad with <mark>Non-Traditional Caesar Salad, Warm Anchovies, Capers and Garlic Vinaigrette</mark>.\n\nentrees:  perhaps the best received dish was t's roasted rack of lamb and tomato tart.  he thought it impeccable.  my muscovy duck breast was good, but not as tasty as duck i recently had in atlanta. my daughter enjoyed her <mark>'The King' <mark>'The Queen' Broiled Beef Tenderloin Filet Mignon</mark></mark>, but again, there was nothing extraordinary about it.  you'll find that meats are high quality,  and cooked to perfection.  if you want it rare, you'll get it rare.\n\ndessert:  curious about the \"acclaimed\" souffl\\u00e9s, we ordered two.  (note that the order must go in, early on.)  none of us were bowled over.  the chocolate souffl\\u00e9 was ordinary, the caramel somewhat better.   perhaps this is petty, but coffee at $7 per person seems excessive.....\n\nin summation: i vacillate between three and four stars.  we spent $500 for dinner that was indeed good, but hardly stand-out.  i'm happy for the experience ; the view of the fountains, as everyone points out, can't be beat.  am i glad we came?  sure!  will we return?  nope.", 
            "there is no doubt that you go here for the view. \nyou can overlook the bellagio's water fountain show. \ni went there around 6:30 to see the view before and after the sunset. \nthe food is 3.5 stars. but the service 5 stars. \ni had a filet with <mark>Muscovy Duck Breast, Camargue Rice, Pistachio, Sauce Foie Gras</mark> and <mark>Rossini Style <mark>'The King' <mark>'The Queen' Broiled Beef Tenderloin Filet Mignon</mark></mark>, Foie Gras, Truffle Sauce</mark>. \nit was pretty good. \nnapoleon for the dessert was two thumbs up.", 
            "service was excellent, the food was great. \n\ni took my wife there for our anniversary, i reserved a table a head of time along with a dozen of red roses for the table. our waiter was very knowledgeable about the menu and gave honest opinions about the dishes that we had questions about. love the fact that i wasn't rushed to do anything. that's from looking over the menu to paying for the bill. the sommelier was very knowledgeable and a great help. although we ended up going with a cocktail she was truly a help. \n\nwe had tartar salmon, followed by creamy onion soup,  then for our main course my wife had \"the queen\" (<mark>'The King' <mark>'The Queen' Broiled Beef Tenderloin Filet Mignon</mark></mark>), while i had the neapolitan of rabbit. for sides dishes we shard a chessey potato dish and a mushroom spinach dish. then finished the night off with a grand marnier souffl\\u00e9. and because it was our anniversary they gave us a chocolate mousse desert, with a special writing in chocolate drizzle. \n\ni would definitely recommend this place to a friend.", 
            "i'm definitely a fan of this place! it's very pricey, so be aware. but i really loved it all. \n\nfirst and foremost - the service here is top notch! the waiter is professional, helpful and folded our napkins even when we went to use the restroom. \n\nomg - the food here is also great! we decided to be daring and order dessert first! yum! we shared the chocolate plate, which had like 5 different truffles on it and it was amazing. i brought 5 girls here for my bachelorette party! \n\ni got the queen <mark>'The King' <mark>'The Queen' Broiled Beef Tenderloin Filet Mignon</mark></mark>. it was delicous. i also got it with <mark>Classic Potato Gratin</mark>, which was a la carte, and very traditional french. \n\nthe bread is to die for!!! and the butter too! \n\ni also go the berry drink, and loved it!", 
            "delicious dinner with a fantastic view.\n\nwe went in for dinner before catching or flight back home and did have time to spare, therefore we had to skip appetizer and dessert in the interest of time.\n\nservice was prompt and our server was friendly. when we mentioned we were catching a flight they seemed to step on it and got our food out pretty quickly, and handled the check with remarkable speed.\n\nthe overall the meal was very good. my only complaint would be the value proposition, which was an issue for me in many of the restaurants we visited. you pay a lot of money for good or ok food. some of these places, like the eiffel, have redeeming qualities that i'm sure are factored into the prices.\n\nthe setting is very romantic, red & white decor with mellow music and dim lighting.\n\nnote: if there is a party going on at the club the music will reach the restaurant. some may find that annoying.\n\nwe had a window table that offered a fantastic view of the strip. the half circle tables allow guests to sit close together while enjoying the view with no effort. if you're lucky, or if you plan it, you can get a table right across from the bellagio and get to see the water show while enjoying your dinner. on any other table the view will still be great.\n\nthe corn soup was unimpressive. the lamb and the <mark>'The King' <mark>'The Queen' Broiled Beef Tenderloin Filet Mignon</mark></mark> were cocked perfectly, and were savory and tender. the side of potatoes au gratin wad good, the mushrooms but so much.\n\nif you have the budget, and are looking for a romantic and impressive venue with good food, the eiffel is a sure bet.", 
            "i read plenty of reviews on here before finally deciding to book, i was also close to cancelling my reservation because of them but i'm glad i didn't. leading up to the reservation they send you a text message asking you to confirm. when you do they will respond and ask you if you have any preferences, whether or not you'll be celebrating anything and would like to know if you want win/champagne or even a rose on your table which is nice. the view was great, we had a half circled table facing the water show at the bellagio, the server (rebecca) was awesome, really outgoing and over all made our dining experience even better since she was personable. the food was about the best french cuisine i've ever had, i ordered a <mark>Prime Aged New York Steak</mark>, my wife got the <mark>'The King' <mark>'The Queen' Broiled Beef Tenderloin Filet Mignon</mark></mark>, of course we got the veggies and potatoes etc but what really sealed the deal for us was the caramel souffle. they also have a photographer that will take a picture at your table or with a view of outside that charges $25 for the picture (price is tacked onto your bill) so you can expect to spend close to $300 or so with a few drinks, your meal and the picture not including the tip. overall though you are paying for a really good meal and an experience which makes it all worthwhile.", 
            "we didn't get to choose what we ordered since we did a group menu, but it was delicious nonetheless. we all had the <mark>'The King' <mark>'The Queen' Broiled Beef Tenderloin Filet Mignon</mark></mark> which was good, not great, but the appetizers were the ones that were super delicious. i love fois gras and their appetizer with jam was astounding. super delicious. somewhat built up by the waiters who said this was the best they've ever had (tough bill to live up to!) but it was super good nonetheless. i don't think waiters should necessarily say that, because anything other than best ever is disappointing. i'd love to try the other items by coming back. i also expected, for some reason, for this to be at the top of the eiffel tower but it's only a few floors up. good view of the bellagio fountain though!", 
            "my bae and i had one of the best meals at the eiffel tower restaurant located in the paris hotel. we had made reservations weeks in advance.\n\na very romantic place where we had a window view of the las vegas strip. from the hostess that guided us up the elevator to our waiter--the staff was so helpful and accommodating.\n\nwe started off with our regular hennessy and two seafood platters. the platters included, lobster, crab, oysters and clams. the meat easily came out of the shells. i don't think i have ever had crab meat come out that easy. very good start to our meal.\n\nthe <mark>'The King' <mark>'The Queen' Broiled Beef Tenderloin Filet Mignon</mark></mark> was cooked a perfect medium rare and accompanied by a side of (classic) <mark>Classic Potato Gratin</mark>. \n\nwe finished our dinner with a pumpkin souffl\\u00e9 and espressos. a very romantic and enjoyable time. great food, date and view--what else can you ask for?"

            "out of all the meals that i had here in vegas this was my favorite, it was my first time eating in a french restaurant. we were gonna dine at one of the most fanciest places in all of las vegas, it was me, my dad, mike and his wife martha, joe and his wife deb (joe treated everyone to dinner) and paul and his wife linda (a table of 8). located on the 11th floor of the paris, we took the elevator up and when we walked in we saw the kitchen staff hard at work preparing dinner then we saw this big extraordinary, elegant room and you get a nice view overlooking the bellagio fountains outside. \nwe sat down and while making our decisions for appetizers were treated to a lovely amuse-bouche (french for amusing the mouth, to wake up your palate, with a bite-sized appetizer) it was a shot glass filled with <mark><mark>Lemon Parsley Butter, Bearnaise, Bordelaise, Green Peppercorn, Black Truffle</mark>, Stone Ground Corn, Celery Root</mark> mousseline (mousseline is a creamy soup-like sauce when you fold whipped cream into hollandaise) it was topped with some chopped celery for some texture (a nice way to start the meal and to wake up the palate). for my appetizer i got the new york state <mark>Muscovy Duck Breast, Camargue Rice, Pistachio, Sauce Foie Gras</mark> which was sitting on a crispy alsace spice cake with quince compote and petite mache (<mark>Muscovy Duck Breast, Camargue Rice, Pistachio, Sauce Foie Gras</mark>, which is what i call meaty butter, melts in your mouth, quince a tart fruit, similar to a pear in appearance but has the similar taste and texture to an apple, spice cake was a nice crunchy little wafer spiced with cinnamon and mache a leafy green that has a nutty flavor, it was awesome). \n\nmy dad got the lobster bisque with lobster flan, celery and a brioche crouton (rich, smooth creamy soup with a flan in the center made from lobster stock, you get some crunch from the celery, and then you take a bite of that crispy brioche crouton, its spectacular). everyone else at the shared 2 different salads, the 1st one was a tuscan kale salad, door county dried cherries, cherry tomatoes, quinoa croutons, toasted pecans and finished with a balsamic vinaigrette (so much going on in that salad, crisp, earthy kale, sweetness from the cherries, tartness from the cherry tomatoes, you get crunch from both the croutons and pecans and you get acidity from the vinaigrette). the 2nd one was a non-traditional caesar salad with a dressing made from anchovies, capers and garlic (i honestly don't know what was non-traditional about that salad and i thought the dressing was a tad bit too salty for my taste). \nfor our drinks, while everyone else was mostly having red wine or chardonnay, me and martha partook in one of their signature cocktails: the eiffel affair (consisting of blueberry vodka, cr\\u00e8me de cassis, cointreau, rose nectar, some champagne for that fizzy and bubbly effect and topped off with some fresh berries). \nfor our entrees: i had the rabbit with braised carrots confit and mustard jus (my first time eating rabbit, so moist and tender like chicken, bite from the carrots and sweetness from the mustard jus, they use dijon mustard). my dad and paul had the pan seared pork chop with spiced braised apples and with a calvados sauce (juicy pork, the apples go so well with pork and the calvados sauce was sweet tasting, calvados is an apple brandy), mike got the roasted rack of lamb with tomato tart and <mark>Roasted Rack of Lamb, Tomato Tart, Tarragon Jus</mark> (the bones were beautifully frenched ), martha got the red snapper with razor clams, fingerling potatoes, tomato confit and finished with a shellfish bouillon (the fish had a nice crispy skin), deb and linda had the roasted chicken with apricot, quinoa pilaf and moroccan spices (i love roasted chicken, so flavorful). joe got the char <mark>'The King' <mark>'The Queen' Broiled Beef Tenderloin Filet Mignon</mark></mark> with a <mark>Rossini Style <mark>'The King' <mark>'The Queen' Broiled Beef Tenderloin Filet Mignon</mark></mark>, Foie Gras, Truffle Sauce</mark> (his was the most expensive).\n then we ordered dessert: i got the white chocolate banana elysee (it was named after a building in france, it was sliced bananas and white chocolate disks stacked on top of each other surrounded by a moat of a chocolate/vanilla sauce mixture and at the top there be a little ball made of caramelized sugar, normally i don't eat bananas but this was so damn good, it was the most stunning dessert i've ever eaten, it looked like a spaceship and boy did i take it to my leader, my stomach), mike and martha got the chocolate hazelnut a la parisienne with vanilla ice cream (it resembled a bear claw, mike and martha seemed to enjoy, but i thought it was bitter and after 2 bites i couldn't take anymore), joe and deb got the raspberry napoleon with a vanilla blanc manger and red fruit sorbet (stacked beautifully) and paul and linda got the classic cr\\u00e8me brulee (a bit of a clich\\u00e9). \n\neverything was amazing, but i had to delete the pictures that i took here due to the flash on my camera not working so after calling the restaurant a couple times (10) linda (one of the hostesses) and sharon (one of the general managers) were kind enough to help me out and to email me the pictures. also more thing my dad says you should adjust the lighting cuz it was very dim to him. i really had a nice time here, i'll be sure to come here again the next time i'm in vegas !!!", 
            "this is one of our favorite spots on the strip to have lunch and see a magnificent view of the bellagio fountains.  perched upon the 12th floor or so the swank restaurant and full bar offer pent house style atmosphere.\n\nprices are upscale with most lunch entrees ranging from $16 to $36.  we sampled the following items:\n\nlamb burger: a thick 1/2 pound crazy juicy mouthful of wonderfulness! using moroccan spices red peppers, onions and yellow squash this burger was one to remember.  potato chips were served on the side $18.\n\neiffel tower burger a classic well cooked yummy burger also served with potato chips.  the burger was good but not in the same class as the lamb burger $16\n\nmushroom pasta: fresh spaghetti noodles with a light sauce <mark>Gratinee Creamed Spinach and Mushroom</mark>. great flavor and just the right size portion $18\n\nfrench cream of onion soup; creamy onion soup, i prefer the original version $6\n\nlunch was also served with a <mark><mark>Lemon Parsley Butter, Bearnaise, Bordelaise, Green Peppercorn, Black Truffle</mark>, Stone Ground Corn, Celery Root</mark> puree which was a delicious bite and the some of the best baguettes ever!\n\nsince we were there to celebrate my daughters birthday she was presented with a beautiful chocolate mousse along with milk chocolates and jelly candies.\n\nservice was outstanding and although the prices were high it was well a great dining experience.  i highly recommend coming for lunch.\n\nnote: the bellagio fountains start at 12 or 1pm on the weekends."

            "surprised my husband with dinner here for his birthday.  fabulous view of the las vegas strip.  we lucked out and caught the only bellagio fountain show of the evening - due to high winds.  \n\nthe only thing that bugged me was that in this classy restaurant, there are still those people who don't even try to dress up a little.  ripped jeans and a tank top?  come on.  don't mind me - that's just a pet peeve of mine.\n\ndinner was excellent.  any time there's escargot on the menu, you know it will end up in front of me.  yum!  dinner consisted of steak for both of us.  <mark>'The King' <mark>'The Queen' Broiled Beef Tenderloin Filet Mignon</mark></mark> for me, bone in rib eye for him.  both were cooked to perfection and topped with <mark>Classic Potato Gratin</mark> and sauteed mushrooms.  we were stuffed, but no birthday is complete without dessert.  somehow we managed to down a grand marnier souffle and the apple strudel before rolling ourselves to the casino.", 
            "now *this* is more like it. ultra spendy? you bet. but totally worth it. \n\ni loved everything about this place, and was so, so, so glad we decided to splurge here on our last night in vegas. with no res, we came up the elevator, gave our names and only had to wait about 15 minutes at the bar before we had a seat. the bartender was hilarious & sweet, and the hostess carried our wine over and seated us in a large, plush booth. \n\nthe view = incredible. this place is mid-way up the faux eiffel tower, facing the bellagio - so we got to see the water show more than a few times while we ate. \n\nthe food = even more incredible. we started off with the blue cheese souffl\\u00e9 pudding, walnut pecan petite salad. holy god, that was good. for entrees, we had the <mark>Prime Aged New York Steak</mark>, braised celery heart, <mark>Broiled 22 oz. Bone-in Ribeye, Roasted Bone Marrow</mark>, cabernet reduction and the filet of sea bass, fingerlings, double smoked bacon, crispy potato, petit mache. plus, we shared the <mark>Classic Potato Gratin</mark>. it was all amazing. and they aren't messin' around with the portions. everything was as filling as it was delicious. \n\nto finish off, the special eiffel tower souffl\\u00e9s in chocolate and raspberry. they take 30 minutes to make, so we had the foresight to order them before our meal and they were just perfect. the waiter does this fancypants thing where he pours the cream and chocolate into them at your table and they get all big & fluffy. mmm. mmmm. \n\nthe topper: our *very* french waiter was great! constantly checked up on us, made funny jokes, and didn't even blink when i spilled water all over the table. in fact, he moved us to another! \n\nall in all - just the best. i would for sure splurge to go here again. it was romantic and beautiful and i left completely satisfied.",

            "my fianc\\u00e9 treated me to a romantic dinner during our trip to las vegas.  we stayed at the paris hotel so we decided to try the eiffel tower restaurant.  he made reservations on www.opentable.com. this restaurant requires a credit card for reservations and if canceled they will charge $50 to your cc.  however, if you need to make changes you can call the restaurant directly rather than going through opentable.\n\nwe were seated next to the floor-to-ceiling window that boasted a beautiful view of bellagio's water show. very romantic.\n\nwe started off with a bottle of ros\\u00e9 champagne.  their wine list is spectacular, it's more like a book.  after flipping through 10+ pages i decided to go back to the front and picked a bottle. =p  we also wanted an order of fresh oysters on the half shell but the restaurant did not receive any 'good quality' oysters that day so they weren't available. \n\nhis:\nsaut\\u00e9ed veal medallions with braised vegetables & <mark>'Faux Gras', Abalone Mushroom, Sunchoke Puree, Spiced Apples, Wild Forest Mushrooms</mark> = 4 stars\n\nhers:\n<mark>'The King' <mark>'The Queen' Broiled Beef Tenderloin Filet Mignon</mark></mark> with lemon parsley butter sauce = 4 stars\n\nshared:\n<mark>Classic Potato Gratin</mark> = 2 stars\nchocolate souffl\\u00e9 = 5 stars\n\nmy <mark>'The King' <mark>'The Queen' Broiled Beef Tenderloin Filet Mignon</mark></mark> was cooked to perfection and paired well w/the lemon parsley butter sauce.  it was much bigger than i expected and even though my fianc\\u00e9 had a few bites, i still couldn't finish it.  i tried his dish and the veal medallions were tender and soft. very delectable sauce w/veggies too.\n\nthe side of <mark>Classic Potato Gratin</mark> was reasonably priced at $9 but it was below average.  my version of this dish is 10x better, i'm not kidding.   to end the meal, we went with a chocolate souffl\\u00e9 and it was absolutely divine!!  they had many versions of the souffl\\u00e9, such as: banana souffl\\u00e9, grand marnier souffl\\u00e9, pistachio souffl\\u00e9, and a couple more that escape my mind.\n\nservice was top-notch.  from the moment we got on the elevator to the moment we left. 5+ stars for great customer service & attentiveness.\n\n\non a side note: we returned to the eiffel tower restaurant the next evening to have drinks at the bar.  they have a cocktail called \"eiffel affair\" and at $20 a pop it was worth every penny!  it resembled a sangria except that it was sparkling and 100x better.  it is also mixed with stoli blueberi which gives it a nice kick. must try!", 
            "the eiffel tower restaurant sits on the 11th floor of the paris' eiffel tower replica in las vegas; it provides a decor, atmosphere and dining experience that is fitting with its name (which you may either enjoy or find cheesy depending on your likes/dislikes).\n\na private glass elevator takes guests up to the restaurant (kind of an interesting view of floors and activity on the way up and the way back down).  the elevators opens up to the kitchen where the chefs plate the food.\n\nthe restaurant utilizes an old-fashioned dining room--plush red seating and white tablecloth--but the stodginess of it is cut dramatically by the view and utilization of the eiffel tower's metal legs within the restaurant.\n\nthe tables are strategically placed so that many tables have a great view of the strip (with the primary attraction being the bellagio fountains).  lots of big floor-to-ceiling windows create the great view.  the metal framework cuts into the restaurant and it gives it kind of an art deco feel.  the art deco feel with the old-fashioned decor really make this place feel like a restaurant from another era.\n\nthey started us off with a cream soup amuse bouche that was okay but not great.  the complimentary bread was also okay but not memorable.\n\nwe had some appetizers.  the lobster pain perdu was kind of like a lobster bread souffle.  it was okay though not great.  we also had some sea scallops that were served in a wine sauce with onions.  the scallops dish was also just okay.  the scallops were tender and seasoned right.  i've had much better though in terms of scallops (both in outside sear and moistness) as well as the accompanying sauces and sides.\n\nwe also had a little bit of their cold seafood platter, which included lobster, shrimp, crab, oysters, and clams.  this is not my favorite type of starter (i would rather have hot seafood where the chefs get a little more creative in how they garnish/sauce/cook the seafood).  everything was okay, but nothing really stood out here.\n\ni had the venison chop as my entree.  the venison chop had a nice red color, but it was not that juicy.  the meat was tender enough and had a decent though not spectacular flavor.  the huckleberry reduction sounded good, but it did not really do much here (not a particularly prominent flavor on the plate).\n\nthe main side to the venison chop was an oatmeal cake.  this is the second time i've had oatmeal with dinner (the other time was bistro lq).  this would not be my favorite side--not bad (definitely tastes like oatmeal).  the plate also featured black trumpet mushrooms and these were pretty good.  they had a nice crunch to them.\n\ni also tried one of the a la carte slides--<mark>Classic Potato Gratin</mark>.  it was kind of lukewarm.  the potatoes were tender but a little bland (and lacked a creamy cheesy flavor).\n\nwhile almost all of the food was average, the dessert was a real winner.  i had the chocolate souffle and it was probably one of the best chocolate souffles i've had.  it had a great chocolate flavor (they served it with a chocolate ganache, which was also good).  what separated the chocolate souffle was the texture.  very nicely baked.  great texture and great lift.  chocolate souffles are hard to get right.  they are typically dry, spongy or liquidy.  this one though was pretty close to perfect.\n\ni also had some vanilla ice cream, which was creamy but pretty standard stuff.\n\nservice was good in terms of getting the food out at a good pace even though the restaurant was incredibly busy (which also caused the restaurant to be quite warm and loud).  i felt though that the waiter was not as good as some of the other waiters i've had recently.  he did a good enough job, but i felt he was a little stuffy.  i think he could have been a little more personable and relaxed.\n\nlas vegas restaurants are typically overpriced and eiffel tower restaurant is a pretty good example of that.  the food here would be in the same price range as some of the most expensive and best restaurants in l.a.  even when comparing eiffel tower restaurant to other pricey vegas restaurants, eiffel tower restaurant still feels very overpriced.  the prices here are similar to mesa grill, but the flavors at mesa grill are much better (mesa grill uses better ingredients too).\n\neiffel tower restaurant makes a great souffle and i would come back for that.  the food, however, is overpriced and average (despite having the backing of prominent chef jean joho, who also operates the michelin starred everest in chicago).  even though i am not a big fan of las vegas restaurants, i think you could do much better on the strip than eiffel tower restaurant.\n\ni walked here, but i imagine they have complimentary valet parking or self-parking like the other big vegas casinos.", 
            "my friends from oman were in town and asked me about the eiffel tower, so i checked on yelp of course. the 3 of us went for dinner on 3/12/12 and it was wonderful. omg it was really really awesome!\nthe sommelier quickly came to recommend a nice red, which was spot on, we had 2 bottles. the selection of breads was delivered with a big smile. jennifer, the manager, came to welcome us and i mentioned her good job at replying to yelpers' reviews. we were just so excited to be at the eiffel tower restaurant that night! \nvalentino, our waiter, was patient, as we were unsure what to order. he made some suggestions and we quickly decided. i was sure to mention that i'm allergic to shellfish, and it was noted immediately.\nwhile our meals were prepared we received some kind of cold soup in a tiny glass, i enjoyed it more than my friends. then we each received a trio of tiny appetizers, which was unexpected and delicious.\nfor appetizer we ordered: \ncold <mark>Muscovy Duck Breast, Camargue Rice, Pistachio, Sauce Foie Gras</mark> - rich, smooth and velvety.\npepper marinated raw beef - beef carpaccio to perfection.\ntrilogy of imported <mark>Royal <mark>Golden <mark>Trilogy of Imported Osetra Caviar</mark></mark></mark> - with different little toasts/pancakes to serve it on, simply delicious, something i had never had.\nfor main course we ordered:\nmuscovy duck breast - my friend ate it before i could try it, so it must have been great! it certainly looked good!\nboneless organic rabbit - super tender pieces of breast, the rabbit sausage was a bit salty but sausage generally is, still easy to eat though.\nrack of lamb - a refined combination of flavors and juicy tender lamb.\nwe accompanied these dishes with the <mark>Classic Potato Gratin</mark> <mark>Gratinee Creamed Spinach and Mushroom</mark> which were great sides to our main meals.\nwe felt too full to do dessert, but somehow a tray of sorbets made it to our table, and it was certainly refreshing!\none of my friends had an after dinner liqueur i can't remember which, but it completed his meal.\ni hope my friends took good care of our servers, cuz i didn't get a chance to look at the bill. it was one of the best meals i've had in a long time. i sure hope i get a chance to come back as there are so many things on the menu i would love to try!", 
            "really nice view. the waiter was really sweet, flirted a couple of times :) i had a tomato salad which melted right on my mouth. for main i had aged parmesan crusted chicken w/ <mark>Classic Potato Gratin</mark>, vegetables, it was delicious. romantic place.", 
            "i took my husband and some of his family here for a reunion meal, and everyone loved the experience.  laurent, the restaurant manager whom i contacted by email before our visit, ensured that we had a fabulous window table with an awesome view of the bellagio fountains.  our wait staff gave us attentive, patient service.  and the chefs provided delicious meals.  my husband deemed his salmon with <mark>Slow Roasted Filet of Pacific Salmon, Pinot Noir Sauce</mark> \"the best salmon ever.\"  i was a huge fan of the grand marnier souffle and the expensive ($18) specialty cocktails.  our four guests ordered versions of the <mark>'The King' <mark>'The Queen' Broiled Beef Tenderloin Filet Mignon</mark></mark>, and all seemed pleased except for the one who ordered her filet medium well (it was more well done, and therefore tougher, than she had expected it to be).  all of the sides (<mark>Classic Potato Gratin</mark>, green beans, brussels sprouts, <mark>Gratinee Creamed Spinach and Mushroom</mark> spaetzle) were tasty.  the maine lobster salad was very good, though it's worth noting that it contained far less kale than i had expected, just a little taste rather than salad-like greens.  the meal was, of course, seriously expensive ($717 for the six of us, including tax and the mandatory 18% gratuity (the gratuity was, i assume, mandatory because we were a larger group)).  we knew that going in (the menu, with prices, is available on the restaurant's website), however, so we were not unpleasantly surprised.  if you can afford to ignore the cost, eating at the eiffel tower restaurant at paris las vegas is a fun, tasty, memorable experience (the views truly are unforgettable).", 
            "it was our first visit. we got lost, it was so hard to find this place but it was worth it. very pricey but delicious french dish. the restaurant is up towards the building, we had to take the elevator by the receptionist. the bathrooms had employees serving us with paper towels, offering perfumes and waiting for tips. the service was really good and friendly. \n\nwe had the beef wellington and roasted chicken and <mark>Classic Potato Gratin</mark>. they were all good. but i didn't like the potato croquette. the desert souffl\\u00e9 was good also. prepare to have a fat bill even for a couple. i spent more than $300. half a dozen roses cost $30 and a small photo cost $25. i would still comeback coz i liked the food.", 
            "i surprised my wife by taking her here for our 15th wedding anniversary on 6/24/2014.  what a great restaurant.  they sat us by the windows looking over the fountain.  our server, david c., was very nice and treated us with respect.  i ordered the seared scallops and the halibut.  my wife ordered the lobster and pinot salmon with the <mark>Classic Potato Gratin</mark>.  everything was cooked to perfection.  the caramel souffle was phenomenon.  the supervisor, mr. lyle tolhurst, came to our table to congratulate us.  very nice guy.  thank you for everything.  i will definitely come back and will bring my entire family.  a night that i will always remember.",

            "my husband and i dined here the other night to celebrate my birthday and what a great experience it was! i had called about a week in advance to make a reservation. to my surprise, they asked for my credit card number over the phone, which i have never done before. this guarantees your reservation, and if you cancel i believe they charge $50 to your card. a dress code is also enforced, although the woman i spoke to over the phone told me that jeans are allowed as long as they are not ripped up. \n\nas others have already mentioned, you take the (small) elevator to the 11th floor where the restaurant is located. the elevator opens up in front of the kitchen. as soon as we arrived, one of the employees said \"what are you doing in the kitchen?\" he then gave us a warm greeting and walked us to where we would check in. \n\nwe had a great table by the window with a awesome view! my husband and i thought the restaurant would be higher up than it actually was, but it was perfect! we really enjoyed the view of the bellagio fountains (every 15 minutes) and the strip. \n\nwhat we ordered for dinner:\n-maine peekey toe crab salad: with cucumber and black sesame seeds. very light and tasty with a vinaigrette type of dressing. good choice for an appetizer!\n\n-char <mark>'The King' <mark>'The Queen' Broiled Beef Tenderloin Filet Mignon</mark></mark>: with lemon parsley butter. it was cooked the way i wanted and easy to cut into pieces. it wasn't the best steak i have ever eaten, but i still enjoyed it. i also felt that the butter was too thick and it took a while to melt down. \n\n-<mark>Prime Aged New York Steak</mark>: my husband ordered this. he pretty much felt the same way i did about my steak. it was good, but definitely not the best.\n\n-<mark>Galette of Potato Anna</mark>: as our side order. it was basically thinly sliced potatoes that were layered on a plate. not much to say about it, but there's nothing wrong with potatoes cooked with butter!\n\nfor dessert:\n-chocolate souffle: after we ordered our dinner, our server asked us if we wanted to order a souffle because it takes about 30 minutes for them to prepare it. it was interesting when they brought it to our table. first they make a hole in the center of the souffle, then they pour in the chocolate sauce inside. i was a bit disappointed because it wasn't as good as i was hoping it to be. the cake was very moist and fluffy, but i felt that it needed more chocolate sauce.\n\n-i was surprised with a complimentary chocolate mousse for my birthday! it tasted great and i definitely enjoyed it more than the chocolate souffle! i also liked how they served it on a plate with \"happy birthday\" written in chocolate sauce!\n\nservice was top notch! our server was pierre. he was friendly, entertaining, and very attentive. he made us laugh, smile, and really wanted us to enjoy our dinner! also there is a photographer that walks around asking if you would like to take a picture with the illuminated paris balloon in the background. we decided why not, and liked how it came out. we paid $24 for a 5x7 photo. ouch. i know, but it was worth it for us!\n\nmy only complaint is that the tables are packed in very close together. the aisles are also very narrow, so it takes a while to pass by other tables and to get out. \n\nour bill was expensive! but we definitely enjoyed the experience and our night here! hopefully the food will be better the second time around if we ever come back!", 
            "we got there about 15 minutes early. we were in a hurry because we had to go to see the show zarkana and we were hoping to go upstairs to see the view from the top after dinner. even though the restaurant was pretty empty because it was about 5 o'clock, we were still asked to wait until our reservation at 5:15, which was fine but annoying because it was empty. \nwe got seated and the waitress came around and we were escorted to our seats, which overlooked the bellagio fountain. we were given our choice of bread, which was delicious and a sample of soup. that was nice too. \nwhen we were looking at the menu, there was something i had a question about. when i asked, she talked to me like i was a moron. lady, i'm in pharmacy school not a 2 year old. that kind <mark>Galette of Potato Anna</mark> me. anyways we ordered our food and that was delicious. my friend got the veal medallions and i can't remember the name of what i got. they were both great though! \n i felt like the man who was offering bread checked back with us about the food more often than the waitress did. anyways we had told her in the beginning that we were pressed for time and we told her we didn't want dessert and requested the check. she brought over the check and told us to enjoy the show. we had about 20 minutes to spare before we would have to head over to the show and thought we would be able to make it to the roof top, but she didn't even come back after we waited around for 10 minutes. we asked the man that was serving the bread to get her and finally we could leave. unfortunately it was too late and we couldn't go to the top. it was pretty annoying, if she knew we are pressed for time then she should have grabbed the checkbook from us right away. \n\nbottom line: food = excellent, waitstaff = ehh not my fave.", 
            "we celebrated a special occasion with a fantastic dinner in a front row window table overlooking the bellagio fountains. we arrived a little early for our reservation but the hostess stated our table was ready.  the wait staff was friendly and each member was attentive from the choice of breads to refilling water glasses to following up on the satisfaction of our meal.\nthe pace was unhurried and just right. \n\nthe <mark>'The King' <mark>'The Queen' Broiled Beef Tenderloin Filet Mignon</mark></mark> was cooked to perfection and delicious. we shared the <mark>Galette of Potato Anna</mark>, crispy sliced buttery potatos and the green beans almondine that was fresh and al dente. both side dishes are ample in size and perfect for sharing. the wild snapper filet had a crispy skin with a moist and tender inside. the fish was served on a bed of belgium endive along side confit orange with a bordelaise sauce. this entree was just supurb. \n\nwe were offered 3 complementry desserts. first a small chocolate mousse topped with whip cream and a slice of chocolate served on a plate with \"happy anniversary\" piped in chocolate around the rim. very smooth. the second dessert was an artist pallid with 6 different sorbets and in the center a large strawberry incased in hardened sugar. this dessert was over the top. third we were then presented with and able to choose from an assortment of petit fours. so glad we did not order dessert off the menu.\nthe entire restaurant staff contributed to making this a very special experience. with the night time view of las vegas blvd.10 stories below it was like going to the theater.  \n\nwe have been big fans of lettuce entertain you restaurants from their beginning with r.j. grunts in chicago over 40 years ago. thanks rich melman, keep the great restaurants coming."

            "this is an ultra-swanky - if not necessarily \"classy\" - upscale restaurant at the heart of the strip.  i mean, how can a restaurant located on the landing of a fake eiffel tower in an amusement park hotel on the strip in las vegas truly ever be considered classy? it couldn't. anyhow, my dad, stepsister, her friend and i came here for dad's birthday a few weeks ago because he had always wanted to try it. you ride up an elevator to the restaurant and anti-climactically emerge into what amounts to the kitchen.  the layout of the restaurant is in tiers with booths facing out to the windows and a spectacular panoramic view of the bellagio and its fountains.  the service is quite attentive, however the head waiter was just a tad bit creepy in his mannerisms and tone.  now, the food is where this restaurant loses two stars because, although obviously quality ingredients, it just wasn't what you'd expect when you're laying out this kind of cash.  appetizers were fair: cynthia is right, the carpaccio is excellent, however, being a fan of fast food, it struck me as glorified arby's meat.  i dunno. the scallop appie only came with two (for 20 bucks). the surf n' turf consisted of a very good fillet, but topped only with a small amount of baked crab meat, not the lobster tail that one would typically expect.  the sauces were just fair.  my stepsister's friend had the whole lobster, the presentation of which was odd: it was upside down and laid open on the plate, with spinach leaves <mark>Gratinee Creamed Spinach and Mushroom</mark> tucked under the meat. weird. everything is a la carte, so you lay out more shells for the side dishes.  the potatoes au gratin were quite good, but the sauteed mushrooms a bit flavorless and gummy.  so all in all, have dinner here if its a super special occasion and someone else (such as dad) is footing the bill.", 
            "not one bit of snootiness at this french restaurant. everyone was very friendly!\n\nour group had 5:30 p.m. reservations and we were running late, but they were very accommodating and didn't mind at all. (10 girls sharing 2 bathrooms = running late!)\n\nwe were greeted by a spunky french guy when the elevator doors opened. we requested that he take a group picture of us and he was happy to do so with 3 different cameras. our waiter was very nice.\n\nambience was nice and the view was awesome.\n\neveryone enjoyed her food. i got the char <mark>'The King' <mark>'The Queen' Broiled Beef Tenderloin Filet Mignon</mark></mark> with b\\u00e9arnaise sauce, which i recommend. other things that the girls tried that they loved and would recommend:\n\n*baked alaskan halibut, braised vegetables, tomato confit, pistou bouillon\n*filet of sea bass, fingerlings, double smoked bacon, crispy potato, petit mache\n*semi-boneless roasted chicken, green beans, crispy potatoes\n*saut\\u00e9ed pork chop, mushroom, cracked corn, celery\n* great side order: gratin\\u00e9e <mark>Gratinee Creamed Spinach and Mushroom</mark>\n\n5 stars for service, friendliness, quality of food!", 
            "went here for an anniversary on my last trip to vegas, and had a great dinner.  made reservations for 6:15pm on a friday night and got seated right away.  we even got a window table with a view of the bellagio fountains.  \n\nwe ordered some cocktails that were from their cookbook, so we decided to try them.  i cant remember what they were called, but they were good. \n\nthe avocado cold soup thing that they brought out was great, it was crisp and for lack of a better description, tasted like a super fresh, smooth quacamole. \n\nwe split the heirloom tomato salad, which was so light, yet so flavorful. it was so good, we had to try to make it at home when we got back.  it had heirloom tomatoes, avocado, radish and some celery leaves.  the dressing was tomato water with a basil oil.  so good. \n\nthe bread guy that comes around is great.  he does his job well, maybe a little too well.  i was full off the bread before the meal even came. \n\nfor dinner, we ordered the <mark>'The King' <mark>'The Queen' Broiled Beef Tenderloin Filet Mignon</mark></mark> and the beef wellington.  the filet was tender and flavorful, and cooked just right.  they tell you in advance that the wellington cant be cooked to order, because they have to cook it until the puff pastry is done, which is good for those that dont already know that.  we also ordered the <mark>Gratinee Creamed Spinach and Mushroom</mark> and the au gratin potatoes.  the <mark>Gratinee Creamed Spinach and Mushroom</mark> were delicious, and the potatoes were decent. they just didnt \"wow\" me.  \n\nwhile ordering your meal, the server asks you if you will be ordering a souffle, because they have to put the order in early since they take time to cook.  we read reviews on yelp that said you have to try the souffle, so we chose the chocolate one.  it was light and had just the right amount of flavor.  next time, i think i'd like to try the raspberry one, if it is in season. the waiter was super nice, and he brought out this cute chocolate...thing...on a plate that said happy anniversary in chocolate.  \n\nsince it was a nice night out, we bought tickets to go up to the top of the eiffel tower, and it was super convenient that we could buy them through the restaurant.  we also bought a copy of their cookbook, so that we could learn to make that addicting tomato salad at home.  our bill came out to just under $300, for 2 people.  not too bad considering we paid $35 for the cookbook and $30 for the eiffel tower tickets. \n\nthe only reason i am deducting one star, is that the downstairs staff isnt very friendly, and when we had trouble finding the elevator to go up to the restaurant, this elevator control lady was rude, telling us that this was only the down elevator and to stop pressing the button.", 
            "i have two sets of comments here, one for the general public, and the other for the truly discriminating foodie.\n\nfirst, if you're looking for a lovely dining experience, you won't be disappointed.  everything that came out of the kitchen was presented beautifully, the pacing was good, the ambiance, lovely.  probably 'nuff said here, but if you're a foodie, read on.\n\ni have to lead with the wired, secret service earpieces the waitstaff sported.  as you exit the elevator, you're facing the state of the art kitchen, and beehive efficient staff.  if you have lead time on your reservation, do request a table overlooking the bellagio's fountains.  it's a mesmerizing view.  casual diners, stop here.  foodies, read on.\n\nnow for the prix fixe.  98 pp for the meal, an additional 69 pp for the wine pairings, and if you're dining as a couple, you will both need to opt in. \n\nthe amuse bouche was the prelude, and consisted of an onion vichyssoise with a white fish top that was divine.  after this there were three petits of smoked salmon, <mark>Muscovy Duck Breast, Camargue Rice, Pistachio, Sauce Foie Gras</mark>, <mark>Gratinee Creamed Spinach and Mushroom</mark> streudel.  the <mark>Muscovy Duck Breast, Camargue Rice, Pistachio, Sauce Foie Gras</mark> was served atop an almost meringue-light crouton, but it was still too much bread to balance the <mark>Muscovy Duck Breast, Camargue Rice, Pistachio, Sauce Foie Gras</mark>. \n\nfrom there off to the first course - a lobster salad over cucumber papaya relish, paired with a feuillatte blush champagne.  this is, of course, where my palate first deviates from the sommelier's, as i didn't find the blush, well, necessary.  i would have been perhaps happier with a light champagne or chardonnay/chablis sparkling.  lobster, in my opinion, should always be the star of the show. \n\nthe next course was the butternut squash bisque, and that pairing was literally too close for comfort.  no, really, the pinot gris was astoundingly similar to the soup.  in this case, i would have looked for a little more contrast.  the soup was quite wonderful.\n\nsea bass was served next, over a bed of smoky tomato quinoa that was nothing short of brilliant (the quinoa; not the bass, which i actually found a little leathery and over-done.)  a quintessentially russian river chardonnay was served; i would have gone for something un-oaked and less buttery.\n\ni love it when a restaurant *knows* how the beef should be cooked; just a few degrees shy of medium rare.  paired with the perfect ferrari-carano blend, these tiny prime beef roulades were absolutely top-notch.  prime beef roulade, horseradish mousseline and a nod to brussels sprouts\n\ni can't comment on the dessert wine, as they are not to my taste, and beyond my scope. clos uroulat.\n\nwhat i can tell you is to scratch the apple streudel with cinnamon ice cream right off your list of considerations - the pastry was tough enough to need a knife, and the filling, totally forgettable.  way too heavy-handed on the raw sugar as well.   by contrast, however, the white chocolate banana elysium (i believe they called it), was a work of art (photo attached).\n\nif you got to the end of this whole review, without thinking i'm  certifiable, you better link to me.  i want to read your reviews, too.\n\noverall, the restaurant experience was excellent, and someplace i could recommend without hesitation.\n\nbon appetit!", 
            "i came for lunch during restaurant week. i found the menu to be very limited. however, the meal was delicious. i asked if i could get a vegetarian plate instead of the flat iron steak dinner and the chef happily obliged. oddly, for me, the things i enjoyed the least were the complimentary mushroom flan (blah, only was to describe it) and the baked puffed dinner roll (lackluster, not a french baked treat i was looking forward to). the appetizer for the menu was a small salad and a nice size portion of spinach strussel. that was very good. my lunch entree (the one the chef made special for me) was crepes stuffed with artichokes <mark>Gratinee Creamed Spinach and Mushroom</mark> and onions with a marinara sauce and basil pesto (?). it was very tasty. the dessert was also very good. i didnt think i would like basil flavored ice cream but it was refreshing and hit the spot after lunch. overall i enjoyed my meal but i dont think it's a place i would come back to. for what they charge, there are much better places that i'd rather go to.", 
            "my friends from oman were in town and asked me about the eiffel tower, so i checked on yelp of course. the 3 of us went for dinner on 3/12/12 and it was wonderful. omg it was really really awesome!\nthe sommelier quickly came to recommend a nice red, which was spot on, we had 2 bottles. the selection of breads was delivered with a big smile. jennifer, the manager, came to welcome us and i mentioned her good job at replying to yelpers' reviews. we were just so excited to be at the eiffel tower restaurant that night! \nvalentino, our waiter, was patient, as we were unsure what to order. he made some suggestions and we quickly decided. i was sure to mention that i'm allergic to shellfish, and it was noted immediately.\nwhile our meals were prepared we received some kind of cold soup in a tiny glass, i enjoyed it more than my friends. then we each received a trio of tiny appetizers, which was unexpected and delicious.\nfor appetizer we ordered: \ncold <mark>Muscovy Duck Breast, Camargue Rice, Pistachio, Sauce Foie Gras</mark> - rich, smooth and velvety.\npepper marinated raw beef - beef carpaccio to perfection.\ntrilogy of imported <mark>Royal <mark>Golden <mark>Trilogy of Imported Osetra Caviar</mark></mark></mark> - with different little toasts/pancakes to serve it on, simply delicious, something i had never had.\nfor main course we ordered:\nmuscovy duck breast - my friend ate it before i could try it, so it must have been great! it certainly looked good!\nboneless organic rabbit - super tender pieces of breast, the rabbit sausage was a bit salty but sausage generally is, still easy to eat though.\nrack of lamb - a refined combination of flavors and juicy tender lamb.\nwe accompanied these dishes with the <mark>Classic Potato Gratin</mark> <mark>Gratinee Creamed Spinach and Mushroom</mark> which were great sides to our main meals.\nwe felt too full to do dessert, but somehow a tray of sorbets made it to our table, and it was certainly refreshing!\none of my friends had an after dinner liqueur i can't remember which, but it completed his meal.\ni hope my friends took good care of our servers, cuz i didn't get a chance to look at the bill. it was one of the best meals i've had in a long time. i sure hope i get a chance to come back as there are so many things on the menu i would love to try!", 
            "this place was recommended to me by a friend the first time i went to vegas and was not able to go. on my recent trip to vegas i definitely had to go. we made our reservations for dinner early while we strolled through the casino. the woman made it very clear that there was a dress code. we arrived for dinner 30 minutes before our reservation but were seated anyways. i couldn't believe the view its breath taking. between all the vegas lights and the bellagio fountain show about every half hour i was mesmerized. when the menu came i was very intimidated and surprised at how small it was. the prices were very up there. this is the most expensive restaurant i have ever been to in my whole entire life i'm not much of a food critic. i ordered the <mark>'The King' <mark>'The Queen' Broiled Beef Tenderloin Filet Mignon</mark></mark> in the b\\u00e9arnaise sauce with the <mark>Gratinee Creamed Spinach and Mushroom</mark>, the waiter did an excellent job answering my questions and helping me choose a wine. my boyfriend ordered the flatiron steak. we received an asparagus mousse compliments of the chef which i thought was very sweet i'm not sure if they do this for everyone. the food is a decent amount and all of it was delicious nothing out of this world though. i recommend it for a romantic intimate dinner a man even proposed to his wife while we were there (she said yes) it really was one of the most amazing views. the check came out to about $200 including tip. for the money i feel like we could've gone to another swanky vegas restaurant and gotten a better dinner but it's just one of those things you have to experience. i was scared of a snotty establishment but the staff were all sweet and helpful.", 
            "our one year anniversary dinner! made reservation at 8, changed to 9:30, still requested a window seat with bellagio fountain and strip views, host girl was so nice, gave us a window seat before 9:30, great job! i had a specialty cocktail at the bar, red velvet, it was so yummy! sweet but strong, liked it a lot. \n\ni can't even describe how amazing the views were.... i had photos of that, please check them out! our waiter greeted us very friendly, gave us wine list first, expensive bottles of wine, red, white, sparkling, i didn't see one bottle less than $70, we ordered bottle of champagne around $100, it was so good! we took time to look through the menu while sipping on our champagne. \n\ntheir complimentary bread was a big tray, server carry it around for dining people to choose what kind of bread we want, they gave us a creamy soup as dipping sauce,  butter too. i didn't like the cold bread and soup, but it was a great dipping sauce, bread tasted so delicious with it.\n\nour amazing food:\n<mark>Trio of American Caviar</mark>, golden whitefish, american sturgeon, salmon roe, 28 grams each, with creme fraiche, chives, blinis and toast: they were heavenly delicious! beautiful presentation! we enjoyed every single bit of it very much\n\ncream of mushrooms soup, wild rice galette, crispy shallots: so delicious, soup was very flavorful\n\nmaine lobster salad, roasted butter squash, wilted kale, old cider vinaigrette: the kale was so yummy! the lobster was very tender and flavorful, loved loved it! \n\nfricasse of escargot, sweetbreads, fennel, farm raised poached egg, pinot noir jus: the escargot was so tender, but not very flavorful, the poached egg was perfect, i still loved it cause i wanted something light as entree for that night. \n\nchar <mark>'The King' <mark>'The Queen' Broiled Beef Tenderloin Filet Mignon</mark></mark>, red wine sauce: hubby asked for extra red wine sauce, he said the filet was one of the best he has ever had for a very very long time! he absolutely loved the red wine sauce!\n\n<mark>Gratinee Creamed Spinach and Mushroom</mark>: too creamy to our liking, but still yummy\n\nwe didn't order desert, the portions were really big for french cuisine! but the restaurant gave us chocolate mousse for our anniversary! they even put chocolate \"happy anniversary\" on the plate.... aww... it was just too sweet and beautiful! \n\ni was so happy for our memorable anniversary dinner, with beautiful views from our seat, over the top service, tasty champagne, delicious food, what more could i ask?.... it was just amazing! $350 dinner was very well worth it....\n\na perfect restaurant for romantic dinner date or special occasions!", 
            "i took my husband and some of his family here for a reunion meal, and everyone loved the experience.  laurent, the restaurant manager whom i contacted by email before our visit, ensured that we had a fabulous window table with an awesome view of the bellagio fountains.  our wait staff gave us attentive, patient service.  and the chefs provided delicious meals.  my husband deemed his salmon with <mark>Slow Roasted Filet of Pacific Salmon, Pinot Noir Sauce</mark> \"the best salmon ever.\"  i was a huge fan of the grand marnier souffle and the expensive ($18) specialty cocktails.  our four guests ordered versions of the <mark>'The King' <mark>'The Queen' Broiled Beef Tenderloin Filet Mignon</mark></mark>, and all seemed pleased except for the one who ordered her filet medium well (it was more well done, and therefore tougher, than she had expected it to be).  all of the sides (<mark>Classic Potato Gratin</mark>, green beans, brussels sprouts, <mark>Gratinee Creamed Spinach and Mushroom</mark> spaetzle) were tasty.  the maine lobster salad was very good, though it's worth noting that it contained far less kale than i had expected, just a little taste rather than salad-like greens.  the meal was, of course, seriously expensive ($717 for the six of us, including tax and the mandatory 18% gratuity (the gratuity was, i assume, mandatory because we were a larger group)).  we knew that going in (the menu, with prices, is available on the restaurant's website), however, so we were not unpleasantly surprised.  if you can afford to ignore the cost, eating at the eiffel tower restaurant at paris las vegas is a fun, tasty, memorable experience (the views truly are unforgettable).", 
            "my wife and i made the trek to vegas for memorial day to celebrate an early anniversary.  initially we had reserved at picasso across at the bellagio, but with the heavy traffic we were forced to find other options.  we've been to vegas countless times so we finally decided to try the eiffel tower restaurant.  i have to say, it exceeded my expectations.  the dining room was a great rendition of those parisian brasseries.  although there were a few open seats that faced the window, the hostess could not accommodate us due to prior reservations.  we were pretty hungry so at that point, it wasn't worth the wait.  \n\nas it turns out, this was a bit of a serendipitous turn as we were waited on by one of the best waiters i've experienced in quite a while in rodney.  from listening to our tastes, he was able to recommend us two delicious red wines that paired perfectly with the dinner selection that we chose. \n\nbefore we even started, we were served a nice amuse bouche of chilled avocado puree.  it was a nice palate cleanser and a welcome bite after such a long drive in.\n\nwanting to maintain that french theme, we chose the fricassee of wild escargot, potato, sweet garlic souffle and the roasted <mark>Muscovy Duck Breast, Camargue Rice, Pistachio, Sauce Foie Gras</mark>, rhubarb compote, alsace spice croutons for appetizers.  both were quite tasty with a nice balance of flavors.  the <mark>Muscovy Duck Breast, Camargue Rice, Pistachio, Sauce Foie Gras</mark> had a great compote that offset the richness of the <mark>Muscovy Duck Breast, Camargue Rice, Pistachio, Sauce Foie Gras</mark> itself.  escargot is definitely an acquired taste, but that said, the fricassee was equally delicious over the bed of potato.\n\nin between, rodney continually checked on us and talked with us like old friends that haven't seen each other for a long time.  \n\nthe main course itself, we chose the <mark>Muscovy Duck Breast, Camargue Rice, Pistachio, Sauce Foie Gras</mark> and the boneless farm raised rabbit, braised carrots confits, mustard jus.  just delicious.  i looked for both of these entrees in paris last fall and to my surprise, i just had to come to vegas for some real french food.  the duck was perfectly cooked and the rice had a very pleasant hint of orange folded with it.  the rabbit itself was slightly crispy on the outside and the meat itself was quite tender.  (those who have never had rabbit before, it tastes like chicken mostly but it does have another unique flavor to it)  in addition we decided to supplement with the potato croquettes and the gratin\\u00e9e <mark>Gratinee Creamed Spinach and Mushroom</mark>.  (we also learned from one of the french staff that croquettes are not french).  amazing.  slightly crispy on the outside and the middle is similar to a mashed potato texture, its something i haven't had before.  the only minus points were the creamed spinach was a little too oily for my liking.\n\nsave room for the souffle.  its a can't miss.  we chose the pistachio (btw, i love all things pistachio - macaroons, froyo, etc.) but i can imagine the other flavors being just as good.  the dessert itself is quite light and the souffle itself has a texture similar to sponge cake.\n\nafterwards, rodney surprised us with a plate commemorating our 2nd anniversary with a chocolate mousse in the center.  at that point, i was quite full, but i did manage to get a small taste of it.  as with the rest of the meal, delicious.\n\nin closing, as someone who visits vegas on a consistent basis, i look forward to celebrating our future events at the eiffel tower restaurant and would recommend others as well to experience the authentic french food and delicious desserts.", 
            "this is one of our favorite spots on the strip to have lunch and see a magnificent view of the bellagio fountains.  perched upon the 12th floor or so the swank restaurant and full bar offer pent house style atmosphere.\n\nprices are upscale with most lunch entrees ranging from $16 to $36.  we sampled the following items:\n\nlamb burger: a thick 1/2 pound crazy juicy mouthful of wonderfulness! using moroccan spices red peppers, onions and yellow squash this burger was one to remember.  potato chips were served on the side $18.\n\neiffel tower burger a classic well cooked yummy burger also served with potato chips.  the burger was good but not in the same class as the lamb burger $16\n\nmushroom pasta: fresh spaghetti noodles with a light sauce <mark>Gratinee Creamed Spinach and Mushroom</mark>. great flavor and just the right size portion $18\n\nfrench cream of onion soup; creamy onion soup, i prefer the original version $6\n\nlunch was also served with a <mark><mark>Lemon Parsley Butter, Bearnaise, Bordelaise, Green Peppercorn, Black Truffle</mark>, Stone Ground Corn, Celery Root</mark> puree which was a delicious bite and the some of the best baguettes ever!\n\nsince we were there to celebrate my daughters birthday she was presented with a beautiful chocolate mousse along with milk chocolates and jelly candies.\n\nservice was outstanding and although the prices were high it was well a great dining experience.  i highly recommend coming for lunch.\n\nnote: the bellagio fountains start at 12 or 1pm on the weekends.", 
            "this was my second visit and as always the ambiance here is upscale and romantic.  a good vantage point of vegas and if you're in the right spot you get a marvelous view of the bellagio fountains.  however, unless only 2 people are dining, the vantage point is mediocre for the fountains.\n\ndinner was delicious.  we only ordered entrees as we had to run to a show.\n\nbeef wellington:  takes approximately 30 minutes but was worth it.  very delicious at medium rare but make sure to ask for the sauce on the side as it can be a bit overwhelming.  \n\nroasted chicken was delish.  it's a large portion and the veggies were cooked just right.\n\nsalmon and the duck were also very good.\n\nsides:  \nclassic au gratin was dry. \ncreamed corn was not good.  it was like a creamy polenta and i hate polenta.  blah!!\n<mark>Gratinee Creamed Spinach and Mushroom</mark> were a hit for the entire table!!\n\nthe downer for this restaurant is the service.  most of the wait staff looks confused and or rushed.  a large table next to us definitely wanted to have a good time and celebrate however, the waiter was clueless.  our waitress was not friendly and was very curt and short with us.  a real shame for such a beautiful restaurant with good food.\n\ni have to say that i truly enjoyed the food here however, based upon the experience with the waitstaff, the eiffel tower restaurant will not be at the top of my list for a nice dinner out.  there are too many other options in vegas that have great food and great service.", 
            "by far this was the best meal we had in all of vegas.  the place is located on the 11th floor of the eifel tower in the paris hotel/casino.  the view was spectacular and the restaurant is glamorous.  we had the best service.  we ordered the pairing, where we get different wines for each course.  but since we had a 4 hour drive, we opted for no wine.  the food was wonderful.   my appetizer was warmed seasoned shrimp over a light sauce.  my boyfriend had the <mark>Gratinee Creamed Spinach and Mushroom</mark> strudel.  he said it just melted in his mouth.  my shrimp was delicious.  his main course was a smoked salmon over egg omelet with crunchy potato strings and capers.     i had the marinated steak over potatoes with poached egg.  omg  the flavors were fantastic.  we thought heaven had come to earth.   our dessert was a souffl\\u00e9 with grand marniere   along with a topping of strawberry ice cream with diced pistachios and fresh strawberries.  it all was great.  please visit this wonderful place.", 
            "had dinner on 12/30, 6:30 pm, a day before new years. despite the busy time of year and day, my wife and i were seated by 6:40 pm.  received a window seat, however, it was on the south side (vs more desirable street side facing bellagio.)  view was nice, but, more reserved.  recommend requesting street side with your reservation.\n\nwife ordered surf and turf which was a tender steak and stuffed crab ravioli.  steak was good (a bit salty), the crab ravioli better.  loved the sauce.  \n\ni ordered the rack of lamb which was delicious.  waiter commented this was new zealand imported lamb vs the more common us lamb, so it was less gamey.  i notice the flavor difference prior to his informing me, so he was right on there.  i only miss the  minty sauce some restaurants typically include with lamb.  \n\naccompaniment, ordered the cream <mark>Gratinee Creamed Spinach and Mushroom</mark>. this was delicious particularly with the sourdough bread that was brought fresh periodically throughout the meal. \n\nour only complaint was that we were not able to use our players card  dinning credits there, as they indicated they are not an official lv paris hotel restaurant.  seemed strange as they are in the eiffel tower within the hotel.", 
            "awesome pre valentines dinner. we arrived right at 4:30 took a few minutes for them to finish setting up and seat us.maria was our server she was very knowledgeable of the menu. the food was phenomenal. we would've preferred a better seat to see the bellagio water show. i don't know if paying 50 dollars just to reserve that particular seat was worth it. our view was blocked a little.the meal was pricey which was  to be expected but the food was amazing so for us it was a nice treat. i recommend the lamb and beef wellington. the lamb just melts in your mouth.we shared the <mark>Classic Potato Gratin</mark> <mark>Gratinee Creamed Spinach and Mushroom</mark> as our sides.  which were also amazing. we will definitely return.", 
            "this restaurant was absolutely wonderful. from the minute we entered the service was exceptional. we were immediately taken care of, and checked on quite frequently (without it being overbearing). we got the last window table and i'm really glad we did (try to request this in advance, if possible...it's well worth it) because the view is lovely and you can see the bellagio fountain show all throughout dinner. the food portions were more than enough, especially if you get some of their accompaniments (we got the <mark>Classic Potato Gratin</mark> & <mark>Gratinee Creamed Spinach and Mushroom</mark>). believe it or not, we didn't even have room for dessert! everything was delicious, perfectly cooked (although the duck may have been slightlyyyy over-cooked but still great), even the bread & butter was tasty!\n\ni would definitely go back for a special occasion, and would highly recommend."
