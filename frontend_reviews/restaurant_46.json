            "every time i come to vegas i always stop here at least once on my trip.  its not far off the strip and you get some of the best tofu and fish you can get in vegas.  i recommend lots of items.  ask what is best but for sure you should get the miso soup and both cold and hot tofu.  its homemade and taste unbelievable. other hot picks are the..\n\n1. kobe beef both plates\n2. <mark>Rakus Tofu</mark>\n3.mushroom wrapped with bacon\n4.fish sashimi special (ask for it)\n\nand the list goes on and on.  stay off the cheesy vegas strip restaruants and do your self a favor and give this place a try whether your a local or just visiting vegas.  cheers", 
            "so much food, not enough belly room!  this dining establishment is a hidden gem located within a busy plaza in chinatown.  i had called weeks prior to the date of arrival trying to get a reservation.  unfortunately, no one picked up my three phone call attempts on various days.  that was very disappointing.  \n\non saturday night, the gf and i decided to come here in hopes of scoring a table without reservations.  we were greeted by the hostess, and she said we would be able to sit at the bar in about ten minutes.  five minutes pass and we ask her if we would be able to get a table instead.  she says no, and that they are booked for the night.  then, a couple minutes later, she tells us someone who made reservations did not show up!  \n\nthe menu is one page, front and back, with lots of options that will make your mouth water.  we decided on the infamous <mark>Rakus Tofu</mark>, <mark>Juicy Deep Fried Chicken</mark>, <mark>Crispy Asparagus Okaki</mark>, corn potato, butter sauted scallop, foie gras don, soboro don, and the waygu beef sashimi.  \n\nthe tofu was no joke.  it was the freshest i have ever eaten.  the ingredients used to pair  with the tofu complimented each other perfectly.  make sure to try the green tea salt because that is what the chef recommended first.  out of all the dishes, the plating on this one was the most creative.  the asparagus came next, accompanied by the corn potato.   the asparagus coated in the tempura batter was mind blowing.  the outside was so crunchy, and was a pleasant surprise.  the corn potato was my favorite dish.  never could a dish be so simple, yet so elegantly presented.  i do not know how they did it, but hats off to them.  \n\nnext up was the waygu beef sashimi, buttered scallop, andthe <mark>Juicy Deep Fried Chicken</mark>.  the waygu slices were ultra thin, and such top tier cuts.  i practically ate the whole thing, and still wanted more!  the scallop was served on its shell, and the light sauce drizzled on top was very good.  the scallop itself was a tad bit chewy, and there were two hard mystery pieces that needed to be spat out.  the juicy, <mark>Juicy Deep Fried Chicken</mark> was very good.  although i wished it had been more crispy, it was definitely juicy.  i would have enjoyed it more had there been no chewy tendons in some bites.  \n\nthe foie gras don and soboro don came out last.  the foie gras was everything one could hope for, and so much more.  the buttery duck was well worth the wait.  the sauce that went with it was so good.  the soboro don was just okay.  i could have done without the pickled mustard, and there was no sauce to go with the dish.  \n\noverall, i am definitely impressed by this place.  i will also have to check out raku sweets as well!"

            "it takes a lot to really impress me. ichiza is one of my favorites. but i came here with an open mind. when we ate here it was definitely an experience. the place is small and limited seating. but i can understand how they make really good money. the decor is modern japanese. the food was way good. we ordered a lot of different foods. i didn't try the fois gras because my roommate doesn't agree eating it. so out of respect i didn't do it. but most of the specials we did order.\n<mark>Yellowtail Carpaccio</mark> - not really carpaccio - it was more sashimi in a spicy sweet sauce. definitely fantastic and fresh tasting.\npompona - <mark>Fried Ice Fish</mark> with broiled squid steak in a dashi broth. wow. i killed the head and tail. ate it bones and all.\nbamboo shoots. - never had it fresh and tasted like corn and charred grill, sweet and outstanding. ordered 2\nkobe miso skewer - ordered a bunch...wtf - it was bananas.....\nblue fin tuna - 18 dollars - from japan - amazing!\nrock cod - yes looked fun and interactive served with radish and we tore that fish up. it was fresh and sweet and perfect. $30\nkurobata pork cheek. ordered 5 of them \nmushroom and bacn - yumo\nchicken thighs - eh i liked ichiza better\nscallop....was bananas b-a-n-a-n-a-s\ntakana inari - pretty good with the green stuff in it.\nkobe beef with garlic....mmmmmmm\ngrilled duck with soy..............omfg  num num num\nbtw order rice by the pot - we ordered a bunch of rice - and 2 dollars a bowl adds up....", 
            "my fiance and i went to raku last night around 9 pm.  we had reservations and were sat right away.  the ambiance of the place reminds us of a small japanese eatery with a clean and simple decor.  the server addressed our drink order right away and we began to place our order.\n\n<mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark>-deep fried tofu served in a soy based broth and salmon egg /seaweed/green onion garnish.\noden- fish cake, radish, house tofu in fish broth and spicy mustard.\nasparagus wrapped with bacon skewers.\nika (squid) sashimi from japan.\ngrilled ika (squid)\nnagasaki grilled mackerel with grated radish\nfoie gras rice bowl\njapanese bluefina tuna sashimi\n<mark>Yellowtail Carpaccio</mark>\nthe dishes we really enjoyed were the <mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark>, blue fin tuna and the mackerel.  the bill was around $185 with tip for 2 people. we just ordered a bunch of different dishes to try but i think the next time it will be cheaper because we ordered a lot of specials.  we recommend this place for all who enjoy japanese high end drinking foods.", 
            "you havent had <mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark> till uve eaten it at raku. \n\nhomemade tofu -- made by the hands of an eighty-year old japanese granny (alright, i dont know who made e tofu, but its good) -- dipped in egg, fried to a fluffy pillow of goodness and floating amongst ikura in a soy-based broth.\n\nimagine rolling the tofu in ur mouth against the ikura -- its like an explosion of textures and flavors. \n\ni think i jizzed in my pants. \n\nthe fluffy cheesecake was another star. its more mousse-like than to cake but still very good. the tofu and cheesecake alone are worth 5 stars.\n\nthe kobe beef w wasabi,  <mark>Yellowtail Carpaccio</mark>, grilled rice balls, and bacon wrapped everything on sticks were gd, but paled in comparison to the the tofu and cheesecake.", 
            "honestly 3.5, but i'm trying to be fair to this place since we weren't being adventurous enough and didn't really try anything that exciting! perhaps it's a true 4 star if you like tofu, urchin, etc. i'll preface this by saying i do truly hate tofu, so i'm going to wait to try this famous tofu another time when i have a tofu lover in-tow. i couldn't justify spending the money on it if it turned out to taste like normal tofu!\n\n<mark>Yellowtail Carpaccio</mark> - decent, but for $11 i wasn't super impressed. it tasted fresh, but it wasn't melt in your mouth amazing or anything. \n\npork cheek - again ,pretty good, but i much prefer pork belly myself. we ordered  1 order for 2 of us and weren't all that anxious to get another one. \n\nlamb chop - very tasty. would i come back here just for this lamb chop? no, but i can say it was prepared perfectly. \n\nduck - i think this may have been my favorite. sad there were only 3 tiny bites on it. \n\nkobe with garlic - fiance's fav. i've had better kobe elsewhere, but it did taste good. \n\nfoie gras - i do love foie gras, so i loved this.. but.... it doesn't compare to the interesting creative foie gras preparations i've had at ogden, nobu, etc. where's my peanut foam or pomegranate jelly? it was well prepared, but i can say that about 90% of the foie gras i've eaten in my life. with a cut this fatty you need acid or a starch to cut it, but this was just fat on a plate. \n\nwe wanted to try the potato-corn thingy, but they were out. \n\ncost: $60 for 2 of us, we definitely left still hungry. definitely be sure to ask the price on the specials - most of the ones we were considering were $18+++.", 
            "this place was fantastic!  it is so different from the standard japanese food we see in the us.  the plates are all small, so you get lots of different flavors.  the service was excellent, and we enjoyed every single part of the sake flight.\n\nmy personal favorites from the menu:\nraku's pickels (especially the radish)\n<mark>Yellowtail Carpaccio</mark>\nfried tofu in broth\nsalmon\nasparagus wrapped in bacon\nenoki wrapped in bacon\ngrilled rice ball in dashi", 
            "raku reminds me that i'm in vegas, grossly overpriced for a lot of stuff. but if you're willing to be fork over the cash, you will no doubt get quality, just don't expect to get value out of your meal.\n\n* foie gras \n\nooooo    m          m   ggggg\no         o    m m   m m  g     \no         o    m    m    m  g   g    g\nooooo    m           m  ggggg\n\nsays it all. its one of those things you just don't want to know what it is or how its obtain, but is good.\n\n* <mark>Yellowtail Carpaccio</mark> - fresh, clean, and refreshing taste. personally i think ichiza's yellowtail tar tar taste much better and cheaper as well.\n\n* enoki mushroom + bacon - bacon tends to be salty, but somehow raku was able to take the saltyness out of the bacon so it doesn't overpower the enoki mushroom. nicely executed item.\n\n* sawagani (japanese river crab) - this has a lot of wow factor when you first see it. the novelty quickly wears off when you eat them. nothing really special about them in the taste department. the bigger crabs have less flavor than the smaller ones because all you get is shell on the big ones.\n\n* uni + seaweed miso soup - the uni was incredibly fresh and has a surprising sweetness to them. the seaweed miso soup didn't overpower the taste of the uni. if they served this nigri style, it would taste even more awesome. \n\n* kobe beef + wasabi - good, but not the melt in your mouth taste i come to expect with kobe beef. the wasabi was also very light tasting.\n\n* kobe beef liver - you think you're getting kobe beef for the first few bites, than when you're about to swallow you get the liver taste. a good item to get even to get even if you don't like liver.\n\n* lamb chop - perfectly cooked medium rare. very tasty and just juicy. how can wynn & texas de brazil fail so badly cooking lamb.\n\n* rice balls - miso flavored riceballs. $5 for 2. nothing special and so not worth it.\n\n* drunken garlic clams - fresh clams with a good broth. this is reminiscence of the equally tasting stuff at naked fish.\n\n* lava cake - its a lava cake. nothing really special from the other lava cakes i've tried before.\n\n* cinnamon + chocolate pudding - this is like milk with chocolate and cinnamon remnants. the waitress said to mix well and i did. a lighter chunky version of chocolate milk?\n\n* cheesecake - cheesecake tends to be very heavy in cheese taste, but it was beaten so it tastes very light, but still taste the cheese. it makes you feel like you can eat this all day and not feel guilty about it. the lightness of the cheese works on this desert. \n\nthe wait staff is very friendly, helpful, and attentive. nothing more you can ask from the wait staff.\n\nbut service isn't perfect. when you're eating at raku, expect to stay 1 hour at the minimum since food comes out very slow at first. but if you do order a lot of items, they come out one right after another. reservations is absolutely required, i've been denied numerous times till i finally went during the middle of the week. \n\nladies, if a guy asks you where you want to eat, ichiza or raku and he's paying, say raku and bash your eyelashes and smile at him. guys, don't even mention raku no matter what kind of cute looks she may give you, you're wallet will thank you!\n\nraku has good food, but you pay a steep price for the ambiance and each item that isn't really that special compared to ichiza. raku is a lot more consistent than ichiza, but ichiza has the advantage of being able to try multiple things when you be lucky to get 1 item at raku.", 
            "simply the best asian food in las vegas hands down. try the asparagus, and dont forget the <mark>Yellowtail Carpaccio</mark>. the tofu in hot broth is godly!!!", 
            "without question, one of the best meals of my life.\n\nwe made reservations for 6:30 on a wednesday for 5 and i'm so thankful we did so.\n\nwe ordered so much i must highlight some of the best:\n\n<mark>Yellowtail Carpaccio</mark>: phenomenally fresh is not even a great enough way to describe the perfection and grade of the hamachi. on the night we went, one of the specials was fatty tuna or  \"oh toro\" after experiencing the hamachi- i almost couldn't fathom any fish tasting greater but this special; unfortunately we didn't order it as it was a bit on the $$$$ side.\n\nthe raw liver was chewy and rich and even better with a bit of green tea sea salt.\n\nthe green tea noodle soup is a dish you absolutely cannot skip- this was a favorite among everyone.\n\nthey also had a special of small soft shell crabs (picture included above) \"sawagani\" which you eat whole- i have had this once before at rising sun in village square, but haven't seen it anywhere since- i must say this is something the adventurous will not want to miss.\n\nthe kobe beef tendon was beyond rich- we only needed two orders of this, but had gotten three. it was incredibly thick and fatty- so good, but i could only handle one piece maybe even half, and one order comes with 2.\n\nalso don't miss out on the crispy asparagus, beef intestine, uni, ground chicken portabella. kobe beef fillet with wasabi\n\nthe only thing i didn't like was the pork ear- some at my table did enjoy this dish though.\n\nthe green tea (sake based) cocktail, was extremely delicious and recommended for anyone who doesn't like to sip on those amazing junmai daiginjos they offer.\n\nall around for such an incredible meal i would have paid twice what our bill came out to. incredible authentic japanese experience.", 
            "raku is one of the most unique restaurants you will find in las vegas.  the location is in a small strip-mall in chinatown, an area west of the strip that has become a sort of hotspot for favorite restaurants of local foodies.  not only is raku in a very small strip-mall, but it's located in the very back corner of the strip-mall, barely visible from the road.  the restaurant is very small, maybe 15 tables at most, and is usually very crowded, so make sure to make reservations.  \n\nwhile i have had one very bad experience here due to the service, i am too loyal to great food to hate this restaurant.  i also have had too many great experiences here to let bad service ruin it for me.  but nonetheless, this should be an example of how good the food is here.  it is what brought me back after that bad experience, and i am glad it did.  \n\nthe food at raku is amazing, that's the best way i can put it.  the menu mostly consists of different skewers of meats, seafood, and vegetables.  all of them are made with the highest quality ingredients, and simply grilled over japanese charcoal grills.  it won't sound fancy, but the flavors are so profound and so noticeable that you will appreciate their simplicity.  i have dined at raku around 10 times now, and have compiled a list of my favorite dishes to get here.  \n-<mark>Yellowtail Carpaccio</mark>: thin slices of raw yellowtail, much like sashimi.  my favorite yellowtail comes from ichiza, but every time i come to raku, i question if this is my favorite.  either way, it will be some of the best yellowtail you have ever had, so definitely try it.  \n-duck w/ balsamic soy\n-foie gras: some of the best foie gras i've ever had, and that's saying a lot.  \n-kobe outside skirt w/ garlic: toasted garlic on top of the very flavorful skirt steak.  \n-kobe beef filet w/ wasabi: one of the best things on the menu.  fresh wasabi grated on top of the very tender, flavorful filet.  get this!\n-kurobuta pork cheek: some of the best pork you will eat.  the small layers of fat are caramelized perfectly on the grill, creating a lot of great flavor in the meat. \n-lamb chop\n-yellowtail: simply grilled yellowtail that is very tender, and perfectly cooked.  fish of this quality needs no sauce as it melts in your mouth.  \n-salmon: just like the yellowtail, melts in your mouth.  \n-chicken breast wrapped in skin: chicken that is wrapped in its own skin and grilled until the skin is crispy.  \n-juicy, deep-<mark>Juicy Deep Fried Chicken</mark>\n-chicken thigh\n\nthere are many other great items, but these are the staple items that i think are a must.  the only problem with raku is that it can get very expensive.  the portions of each skewer are not very large, and you will need several to get full.  the prices are anywhere from $2 for each chicken thigh skewer to $14 for the foie gras.  so when you get a lot of these skewers, it can add up.  i usually come to raku for a special occasion, or a time that i am expecting to spend around $50-$75/ person.  and to be honest, it could easily end up being $100/ person if you want sake, and they have a very good selection of sake.  \n\ndo not bring your own wine in, as they do not allow it, and are very stubborn about not allowing it, as well.  their wine list is terrible, yet for some reason they refuse to have a corkage fee.  when we went in one time, they tried to tell us it was illegal, which was clearly a lie because i've brought wine into many restaurants around las vegas, including other places in chinatown.  but just know ahead of time to either drink sake, or drink bad wine.  they definitely won't let you bring your own.  \n\nthe service can be very good or very bad.  as is the case with many asian restaurants, the service is not very good unless you are asian or a regular.  i've had bad service here, and i've had pretty good service here, but service doesn't matter too much as long as i can get my foie gras!  \n\nand much like most of the other best restaurants in chinatown, raku is open very late, until 2 am i believe.  so \"it's getting late\" isn't an excuse not to go here.", 
            "this is probably my favorite part of my last vegas trip.  expect to spend, but expect to enjoy.\n\ni am going to dive right into the things we tried.  everybody else has already mentioned everything else, so we'll go with my opinions on a few things that i still clearly remember:\n\n+ fried homemade tofu... bomb!  this was amazing.  we started with the homemade (nonfried) tofu and this easily 1 upped it! (it was double the price though)\n\n+pork ear:  so good, perfectly cooked so it was nice and crunchy.  texture was perfect, so good...\n\n+kobe beef tendon:  when you hear tender, you imagine tender.  now imagine something even more tender yet still has enough texture to keep you happy and knowing that it's tendon.  amazing!\n\n+<mark>Yellowtail Carpaccio</mark>:  really fresh, tasty, not fishy at all!  the dip it comes with is very strong so be conservative about it.  you don't want to overpower the star!\n\n+hamachi sashimi:  it was on their special board.  this was amazing.  $20 for 6 pieces of sashimi.  expensive.  but worth it!  it was a nice and fatty cut of fish.  definitely worth it.\n\n+kobe fillet with garlic: this was good, but almost not worth it.\n\n+duck with balsamic vinegrette: amazing.  duck was prefect and the vinegrete complimented the duck so well.\n\n+pork cheeks: i can't believe i initially forgot this!!!  this is my friend's must have here.  so good!  pure pork fat with tender meat.  god.  i want to go back, now.\n\n-xxx wrapped in bacon:  eh.  this has been overdone.  even though it tastes good, i'd rather get it at cheaper places (tastes the same).  i'd get the other menu items before gettign this stuff.\n\nwe ordered quite a bit more, but these were most memorable.  some things were better some worse than things mentioned here.  definitely something to add to your bucket list!", 
            "4.5 stars\n\nraku is one of the off-strip las vegas restaurants i hear most about. raku's charcoal-grilled robata is one of the restaurant's specialties, but they also offer a variety of fresh fish and an assortment of cold and hot plates. before going in, i asked around for recommendations and the answers i got spanned the whole menu. clearly, the restaurant does a lot of things well.\n\nwe ordered a bunch of things in no particular order, but started with an amuse from the kitchen.\n\ntaiwanese spinach, enoki mushrooms, shitake mushrooms, bonito flakes - light and refreshing, this was a nice start to the meal.\n\nbluefin tuna sashimi - the restaurant has a chalkboard of daily specials, and this was one of them. oh my goodness...this was fantastic. exceptionally flavored and really tender, this was so good. easily better than much of the toro (and this wasn't toro) i've had in other restaurants; it briefly reminded me of urasawa.\n\n<mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark> - this homemade tofu was very good - soft and delicate with a subtle but present soy flavor. prepared agedashi style, the umami-rich broth was also very good.\n\n<mark>Crispy Fried Shrimp</mark> - the shrimp here were crispy as advertised and moist on the inside. nothing special really, but good. i'm never really sure if i'm supposed to eat these sort of things in its entirety, shell-on; but we did in this case.\n\n<mark>Crispy Asparagus Okaki</mark> - another crispy dish, i enjoyed the contrasting tenderness of the asparagus with the crispy rice cracker breading. there was a nuttiness to the breading, which i thought also went well with the vegetable.\n\n<mark>Juicy Deep Fried Chicken</mark> - this was a little bit unique as it seemed to be chicken that was rolled up, then fried and cut. juicy on the inside and crispy on the outside - no complaints here.\n\n<mark>Yellowtail Carpaccio</mark> - the fish was good here, but the bluefin spoiled me a bit as it didn't seem as special. still, the wasabi and yuzukosho did a nice job of brightening up the yellowtail in this dish.\n\nfish of the day - yellowback seabream - this was one of the fish of the day, served whole. it was a pretty small dish with only about 8 chunks of white flesh. it was very good though, with a crispy exterior from the deep frying.\n\n<mark>Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard</mark> - the custard was silky smooth with a fairly subtle foie gras flavor. very comforting. the piece of duck breast on top was pretty good too.\n\nwe proceeded with a number of robata-grilled dishes.\n\nbutter saut\\u00e9ed scallop with soy sauce - the scallop (served in its shell) was cooked well, but i thought the butter was a little overpowering here.\n\nchicken thigh - this was the first piece where i could really get a sense of the charcoal grill flavor. there was a smoky char on the chicken, and it was moist and flavorful. really simple and really good.\n\nkobe beef filet with wasabi - again, a good smoky flavor from the grill paired with some really flavorful tenderloin. surprisingly juicy and flavorful. i liked the fresh wasabi as well, countering the rich meat. delicious!\n\nkurobuta pork cheek - i was surprised to find this rather chewy, kind of like a chicken gizzard. maybe i just haven't really had cheek in this type of preparation. it was well-marbled, and the porky flavor was present.\n\nkobe beef tendon - not my favorite. i never really like the tendon though, and this was like a big blob of gooey tendon. so meltingly tender, i wasn't sure if i was biting into fat or tendon. i think this was probably a very good preparation, but it's not my thing.\n\nduck with balsamic soy sauce - an interesting dish here - the duck was prepared well, and the balsamic soy and fresh onions did a good job of cutting through some of the richness.\n\napple marinated lamb chop - tender and juicy, this was a damn good lamb chop. i'm not sure if i got any apple flavor though, but i didn't mind.\n\nkobe beef outside skirt with garlic - really good. exceedingly tender and flavorful, with a nice garlic touch.\n\ni had high expectations for raku and i wasn't disappointed. in fact, it exceeded them. after dining at places from joel robuchon and jose andres, it was nice to get something rather simple with clean, familiar flavors. almost like a detox, if you will. the raw fish preparations (ooh the bluefin!) and the robata-grilled items stood out most to me, but it was a well-rounded meal.", 
            "we went here for my boyfriend's birthday, and it was a lovely experience. \n\neverything is cooked/prepared perfectly. the ingredients are fresh and tasty. the ambiance and design are classy and comfortable. \n\nfor one of the more \"expensive\" restaurants it's decently priced.\nmy favorite part of the meal was actually the cheapest dish we ordered: the <mark>Yellowtail Carpaccio</mark>.", 
            "delicious food, great ambiance and service. their <mark>Yellowtail Carpaccio</mark> was sooo delicious. i liked their cold tofu slightly more than their agedashi. they had their own special sauces for the tofu, and the waitress explained everything. went at 1 am too. their special, grilled sea bass, was also yummy. and their dessert, green tea creme brulee with green tea ice cream - scrumptious. green tea soba was a perfect end to the meal (before the dessert).", 
            "when you start off knowing that all the major players eat here, you know you're in for a meal of a lifetime. not only does raku serve beautifully executed food, it's a bargain at 10+ courses for only $50pp. the icing on the cake is knowing that you may run into joel robuchon, guy savoy, or even mario batali in his orange crocs. raku is the only place that has managed to \"wow\" me even more on the second visit as compared to the first. and that's not discounting the first meal because that was exquisite in and of itself. however on the second visit, raku was able to re-invent itself and offer even more delectables and a considerably different tasting menu that wowed my palate even more.\n\nthe restaurant is unassuming, located in a strip mall in chinatown. the decor is minimal with two bathrooms with serious personality. the service is unfussy but genuine and you can tell that they take great care in plating and execution without taking it too seriously. the flavors are clean and emphasis is on using only the best ingredients. all of the components of each dish are well thought out and serve a purpose. the results are nothing short of amazing.\n\nmy favorites are as follows:\n*<mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark> - homemade tofu melts in your mouth and the broth is heavenly, literally out of this world!\n*<mark>Juicy Deep Fried Chicken</mark> - amazingly <mark>Juicy Deep Fried Chicken</mark> wrapped in <mark>Juicy Deep Fried Chicken</mark> skin...need i say more...\n*<mark>Crispy Asparagus Okaki</mark> - the crispy fry on the outside of the asparagus adds the perfect crunch and toasted rice flavor to add incredible depth. add some green tea salt to bring out the flavors even more\n*dried tatmi <mark>Dried Tatami Sardine Salad</mark> - ceasar salad kicked up a notch, great briny and cheesy flavor\n*kurobuta pork cheek robata - juicy and great grill flavor from the robata\n*<mark>Fried Ice Fish</mark> - beautifully <mark>Fried Ice Fish</mark> served whole with fish nuggets in again, heavenly broth\n*enoki mushroom wrapped in bacon robata - it's wrapped with bacon...need i say more\n*<mark>Yellowtail Carpaccio</mark> - sashimi was incredibly fresh\n*grape tomatoes robata - so simple but simply delicious...add the green tea salt and you're going to be impressed and want to try to make it at home\n*salmon ikura don - beautifully presented and then served into individual portions. the ikura pops in your mouth to bring the taste of the ocean to the salmon rice.\n*udon noodle with <mark>Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard</mark> soup - the broth as well as the noodles were amazing\n*eel don with gobo - again, served with heavenly broth. the gobo added great depth by bringing a bit of earthy bitterness to balance the salty and sweet.\n*<mark>Crispy Fried Shrimp</mark> - fried little shrimpies, delicious.. \n*sorbet of the season - so simple, a strawberry sorbet with condensed milk. the combination makes the sorbet take on a creamy texture and the fruit flavor packs a good punch to end the meal. the kiwi one was delicious as well \n\n\nthe things i would forgo to save room for the things above:\nchicken thigh robata\nchicken breast wrapped with chicken skin robata\nkobe beef outside skirt with garlic robata\n<mark>Tofu Salad</mark> \"caprese\" with seaweed, tomatoes, and dried fishies", 
            "great spot -- definitely worth a short trip from the strip.\n\ni had pretty high expectations going on, but those expectations were actually exceeded. there are so many dishes that i would still love to come back and try, but my favorites were:\n\nuni with salmon roe and <mark>Poached Egg</mark>\n<mark>Yellowtail Carpaccio</mark>\nkobe filet with wasabi\nudon with <mark>Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard</mark>\noyakodon\n\nthe hot and cold tofus were also excellent. \n\nprices are very reasonable given the quality.\n\ncall in advance for reservations!",

            "amazing restaurant! everything was fresh and unique.  i was impressed by everything on their menu.  first of all, since it's been almost a year since foie gras was banned in california, of course that jumped off their menu, and was the first thing that i wanted to order.  but there were so many other mouth watering dishes!  good thing there were 4 of us in our group, so we could order practically everything!\n\ndefinitely check out their daily specials.  there's going to be something terrific on there.  the day i went, we ordered:\n- grilled alaskan king crab\n- uni udon - a must have if you like uni!!!!!!\n- blue fin tuna sashimi\n\nitems on their regular menu that we had:\n- <mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark>: fresh tofu, and served in a whole block\n- <mark>Sashimi Salad</mark>: ridiculously fresh sashimi!\n- <mark>Yellowtail Carpaccio</mark>\n- <mark>Poached Egg</mark> with uni and salmon roe\n- <mark>Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard</mark>\n- kobe beef fillet with wasabi: we had to order this with all of the reviews that mentioned it, but it didn't live up to the hype. :( good but not phenomenal.\n- kurobata pork cheek : a must order!\n- duck with balsamic soy sauce: very tasty!\n- butter sauteed scallop with soy sauce\n- enoki mushroom wrapped with bacon\n- japanese shishito peppers\n\nto finish off an amazing meal, we had to have dessert.  the green tea creme brulee was the perfect way to end the meal!\n\ni never knew about raku before, but i am raving about it now.  i won't be able to take a vegas trip without stopping by, now.", 
            "i remember the first time i visited which was at least a year or two ago. i was with a small group of friends and we decided to try what seemed to be a tasting menu with a sake pairing with each course. this roughly ran us around $100 a person, but definitely well worth it!\n \nmost recently as my second time, it was pricey for small tapas portions but none the less it was just as wonderful as the first besides no longer offering the sake pairing.. no worries though i didn't allow me to get discouraged. i did however noticed they still offered the chef special tasting menu - $75/$100 - the price difference is based on \"quality\" of food. instead we decided to order off the menu using previous reviews as a guide.\n\nwarning tip* \nbe careful of the board the server brings to the table with no prices. they are \"specials\" especially for your wallet...a small sized cooked sea bass filet - $25, and kanpachi sashimi $23. if your willing to pay, i say go for it but don't be surprised when you see your bill at the end. \n\ni first ordered a refreshing citrusy 750ml bottle of sake for the table - $55. pricey and delishious. i later found out it has a lower alcohol content too. (probably wouldn't order again; however it was nice to taste and try)\n\nthe kobe beef filet skewers are a must! - $12ea (a little steep but i guess quality over quantity), <mark>Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard</mark> was delish - $12 , <mark>Yellowtail Carpaccio</mark> was decent however nothing different than what you can get at any sushi bar in town - $12, enoki mushroom wrapped in bacon was a pleaser for me however not for my other guests (i personally love mushrooms) - $3, half <mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark> was a must try because it was raved as being fresh and homemade (no disappointment there) - $7.50, scallop w/soy sauce was tender and not over cooked (unfortunately there was only one piece) - $7.00, we decided to try kobe beef liver sashimi...texture and all were definitely not my cup of tea. at least i can say i've tried it once and only once.\n\nfor dessert we ordered fluffy cheesecake (by far my favorite) yum! - $6, green tea creme br\\u00fbl\\u00e9e and a strawberry sorbet (both were alright) \nend of the meal the bill was - $275 for four plus a 20% tip. \n\noverall, it met my high expectations as before, with their ambiance, quality of food and my own personal tastebud experience. this place is definitely a hidden vegas treasure off the strip.", 
            "<mark>Yellowtail Carpaccio</mark> is amazing. waygu beef is done quite rare so it's a bit too chewy.", 
            "we waited an hour for a table. then waited and waited for dishes to come. it told 2 hours to get a handful of skewers and four dishes. it was excellent food and i would go back for sure.\n\nit's kind of an izakaya but not really since it's more upscale than that, the service is painfully slow and they serve dish they wouldn't have in a japanese izakaya.\n\nwe went there at 9:30 without a reservation. the host said he could seat us in 30 minutes so we told him we would go to sweets raku next door and have dessert first. it seemed like a good plan but then he called not 10 minutes after we started eating our first dessert course to say our table was really so we missed that opportunity since we could abandon our food at sweet raku.\n\nwe got back to raku at 10:30 and waited for a table and waited and waited, once it got past 30 minutes we should have left but it became a game to see just when we would get a table. it was 11:30 when we got seated and 1:45am when we finished. the service was incredibly slow. in the first 45 minutes we only got three dishes-one every 15 minutes. i've been izakayas in japan and in north america so i know that the ones in north america are very different and far more upscale and slow than the common ones in japan. usually if i spend that much time in one in japan it's because there has been lots of drinking and lots of food.\nbut the food, the food was good enough that i would go back and would recommend it to a diner with time to spare. the foie gras chawanmushi was awesome. we got a special of grilled langoustines that wasn't over cooked and served whole. the <mark>Yellowtail Carpaccio</mark> as well as the grilled yellowtail was good. i don't know if the tofu was the freshest i've ever had but it was really excellent in terms of texture. the cost was pretty reasonable, 100 dollars for two people without alcohol. they mixed up our orders twice. towards the end there was a table of regulars that came in and they got served immediately and got 6 dishes in less than 30 minutes meanwhile there were two tables with reservations that had to wait with us and they waited quite a bit. so don't expect fair or quick service. i wouldn't recommend raku for a vegetarian as many of the vegetable dishes have fish stock or other animal products in the prep. it's wheelchair accessible but not well designed for it. it's wasn't too noisy and the lighting is decent.", 
            "the <mark>Yellowtail Carpaccio</mark> was melt in your mouth fresh. my boyfriend won't stop talking about the color and consistency of the blue fin tuna. try the top level sake, it's worth it. our waitress offered a comparison taste test of the different sakes, which was a welcome education and made it a great experience. will be coming back. make your reservation early it's hard to get in on a whim.",

            "food and service top notch. could not have been better. chairs were a bit uncomfortable hence the knockoff of a star. did i mention this restaurant serves its menu as small sharing plates? the food ordered was for two people. \nin no particular order we enjoyed:\nraku tofu 1/2 order\n<mark>Yellowtail Carpaccio</mark>\niberico pork\n<mark>Juicy Deep Fried Chicken</mark>\nkurobuta pork belly\nbuttered scallops with soy\nmatsutake grill\nportabella stuff with asajime chicken\nduch with balsamic soy sauce.\nour favorites were the tofu, scallops, duck with balsamic, and the yellow tail carpaccio. each dish was absolutely tasty and had various spices served with the dishes to highlight the dishes. \nonly a few seats so reservations are a must. if you don't pig out, (we did) try the raku sweets in the next building for some amazingly crafted and beautiful to look at and better to taste dessert offerings.", 
            "i love this place. \n\nit's so good. we came by right when they opened for dinner, since we didn't have reservations and they were accommodating (or we totally lucked out). the place is really small, so reservations are recommended. \n\nthey have three rotating board specials so you might see different specials being presented to different tables. if you ask, they will bring the other ones around to show you. \n\nwe went a little nuts with our ordering, but mostly everything was amazing. \n\nraku's tofu: \n- wasn't expecting to fall in love with this, i mean it's just tofu right? wrong. it was really good with the different seasoning options. it's tofu, but it's different. worth trying out if you come here since it's made in house. \n\n<mark>Yellowtail Carpaccio</mark>: \nmust get. it was just fresh and simple and delicious. \n\nbuttered scallop: \nthis was so good. the flavors were amazing and complemented the scallop. that butter sauce was so good, i wish i had something to sop it up. actually, my friend loved it so much she picked up the shell to drink the sauce. \n\n<mark>Poached Egg</mark> with sea urchin and salmon roe: \nit's a really rice dish, but it's amazing. we shared this, but i could have easily eaten this on my own. i thought it was going to be a little too fishy but everything was fresh and the flavors melded well together. \n\n<mark>Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard</mark>: \nso good. rich, but so good. we shared this as well, but easily could have eaten our own. the flavors of the fois gras came through but wasn't too heavy, probably balanced by the egg. \n\nagedashi kama: \namazing. the fish was piping hot and moist. i thought i had tried a really good hamachi kama at another restaurant in sf, but this one tops it for sure. it was just really flavorful and delicious. \n\nkobe beef outside skirt with garlic:\namazing. the beef was tender and perfectly cooked. the flavors were on point. \n\nkobe beef tendon: \nthis was a little different from what i expected. i'm used to tendon in soups, so i don't eat dry tendon often, but it was delicious nonetheless. \n\nkurobuta pork cheek: \ndelicious. the flavor was slight and smoky. some places overcook it and make it chewy but this was perfect. \n\nbluefin sashimi:\nprepared three different ways, fresh, grilled, wrapped in sushi. all three ways were delicious, mainly because the fish was so fresh. you can really taste the freshness. \n\nbeef waygu sashimi: \nsounded amazing, but it was a disappointment. the meat was really chewy and it wasn't as good as the kobe outside skirt with garlic we ordered. \n\nfluffy cheesecake: \nwe were intrigued by the description. we even poked at it when it came to the table, but the description of a \"mousse cheesecake\" is fitting. it's just really good. i'd order this again. it didn't feel heavy at all. \n\nwe also ordered a different sashimi option but it wasn't nearly as good as the bluefin. i think our two disappointing items were the beef waygu sashimi and the other fish sashimi option. \n\ni'll definitely come back here. it was a pricey but delicious dinner. worth every penny."

            "the first thing that strikes me is i like the intimacy of the place. its located near chinatown, but off of spring mountain hidden behind some other generic plaza, near savers. you can't really just stumble on this place. you need to be told about it. someone needs to take you there. \n\nthe dining area is just large enough to accommodate maybe six small parties and then five at the bar. i wouldn't recommend parties more than four. \n\nwe got there at 10p and we had the whole restaurant to ourselves. an hour later, the joint had filled in. \n\nthe decor is very modern japanese with wood accents and a beautiful ceramic wall behind the bar. \n\nall of the front of house staff speaks japanese and are very knowledgeable about the food and drink menus. \n\nthis is the kind of place you would take a businessman from japan to to entertain and impress. i wonder if they never want to arrive for this reason. keepin' it exclusive. \n\nthey don't served any sushi. mostly everything is either grilled or cooked hot pot-style (oden). \n\nright off the bat, order five dishes per two people and then as things wind down, order as neeed. its izakaya, so portions are small and pricey. my favorites are oden with mochi in aburaage, the scallop thing, kobe fillet, yellowtail collar, pork cheek, and fresh tofu with tomato, konbu, and iriko. \n\nthey also have asparagus or cherry tomato wrapped in bacon, grilled salmon, grilled musubi, grilled corn (wtih the cob hollowed out, stuffed with potato ... i don't know how they do it). \n\nsome of their more exotic items include foie gras ($12 for not even a mouthful) , kobe liver, grilled tendon (pork?), beef tongue cooked or carpaccio, chicken stick dipped in <mark>Poached Egg</mark>, duck with balsamic vinegar. \n\nthe grilled items are all good and all, but they all have teriyaki drizzled all over them. i love teriyaki, but that's kind of cheating. \n\ntheir desserts are all really good, too. i've tried the watermelon sorbet, chocolate bubbly, cheesecake, and lave cake with green tea ice cream. i can't pick a favorite. the lave cake is really light for a lava cake. but order it like 15 minutes ahead. the cheesecake is japanese-style: steamed and fluffy. the watermelon sorbet. just try it. \n\nto eat enough to fill you, you'll rack up a pretty hefty bill.the four of us last night, took it up to $340. bring a big wallet. don't bring a big appetite. i think traditionally, izakayas are drinking establishments with food to accompany food. not the other way around. we're doin it wrong! \n\n* off the strip, non casino", 
            "i've only done las vegas \"buffets\" on the strip... everyone always want to go to the usual big buffets - don't get me wrong, they are wonderful, and the planning of what combination of food best maximizes tastes & value is both an art and a science that i can appreciate...\n\nthis trip, however, was different... one of my good friends (she's an awesome event planner in vegas) decided that it's about time i get a real taste of where the foodies really eat in las vegas...\n\ncue: raku. it's located in an unassuming strip mall where random asian places are located.\n\nit's a small little place, very cozy. one realizes you can't rush things here, the food, the ambiance... is chill, relax. zen. things happen when they do.\n\nwe were in between a wave of tables, so my friend and i waited about 45 minutes for our table. without reservations, on a saturday night, we couldn't complain...\n\nthis is a japanese fusion tapas place - the portions aren't huge, so you can order different things to try and get a taste, and always order more...\n\n---------------------------------------------------\n\nalways asks for today's specials... they have all the specials listed on a chalkboard and the cute japanese waitresses patiently explain what each one is. we ordered my friend's favorites (a foodie trusts another foodie after all) and i was famished...\n\nwhat is this??? the chef sent over a grilled ground chicken skewer on the house! they felt bad we had to wait so long for a table, this started off the night just right. tender, juicy ground chicken, full of flavor but silky smooth, grilled on a skewer and glazed gently with a sweet, sticky sauce lightly. wow, i hadn't thought ground anything can taste like this.\n\nthe next item is tuna belly minced up mixed with flavor oils and minced green onion. the fish is so fresh, it does not even remind me of fish... it tastes of refreshing ocean, and i can feel the breeze...\n\nwe had the sea urchin on soup... i like sea urchin but it is an aquire taste, and it's floating gently on the soup makes one appreciate the delicate urchin and the gentleness of the warm soup that cradles the urchin taste.\n\nwe tried the grilled pork cheeks skewers (get a skewer per person, this is so tasty!) - it tastes like bite size bacon bits with chunks of meat.\n\nwe also had the bacon wrapped enoki mushrooms... how can anything bacon wrap go wrong, really?\n\nnext up is the slippery dish... at least my friend calls it that. a light broth acts as the canvas, floating on top is little mushroom, thinly sliced okra, salmon roes, sliced japanese radish of some kind, <mark>Poached Egg</mark> and sea urchin. everything on this dish is a bit 'slimey' in texture, but all different. it's a complex layering of texture that plays well with each other. (on the other hand, if you hate slimey food, you might not want to get this one)\n\nthen came the favorites of the night...\n\nfoie gras savory steam <mark>Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard</mark> - with a light sauce on top and a piece of duck graces the top of this. the <mark>Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard</mark> was silky smooth, and the richness of foie gras... i had never imagined foie gras can complement the egg so well!!!!!!\n\ngrilled foie gras... a generous portion (for tapas) seared on a grill (smokey flavor!) and gently glazed with a miso-sweet sauce...\n\n\nif you are still reading - we were 2 girls who had all this food. at this point we were done... so full. can't move.\n\nbut dessert calls, and my friend has never tried dessert here.\n\nwe decided to finish the meal off with some 'light dessert' (hahahah light. right). so we ordered the seasonal sorbet, which turned out to be asian pear sorbet.\nwow. it was sweet, juicy, refreshing... the best of an asian pear. it's as if they took the asian pear and froze it and then grind it up into granita... they also drizzled some light condensed milk-cream into the sorbet halfway down the cup. sooo good. a perfect way to finish off a 5 star meal.\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------\n\ni love raku. it's unique, it's interesting. every single plate, from appertizer skewers to dessert, had thought behind it. it's like when you hear music that makes you move with it. when you sit in front of a sunset and life just makes sense. every dish conveyed a message.\n\nlife is way too short to not try this place when you're in town. raku's food touched my soul....\n\n5 stars. absolutely. (pics of the food uploaded to the raku yelp page on top here)", 
            "full review w/ pics in blog.\n\nbeginning first with some appetizers my first choice was <mark>Poached Egg</mark> with sea urchin and salmon roe.  arriving after a short wait and in an ample portion the dish consisted of a cool broth with a warm <mark>Poached Egg</mark> paired with a creamy uni tongue and given a myriad of flavors and textures from a \"soup\" of snappy mountain yams, earthy hon-shimeji mushrooms, salty salmon roe, and pungent green onions.  breaking the egg and stirring the broth it thickened quickly giving the whole dish a mellow and creamy texture that paired beautifully with the fresh uni and other ingredients - at $7 this may have been the most affordable uni i'd ever experienced with such great taste and honestly i would go back to raku just to experience this dish again.\n\narriving shortly after my first plate was finished - and with an explanation of all the little jars and bottles in front of me (a matcha sea salt, a house made soy, a japanese pepper + rice vinegar, and a chili infused oil) - seafood with bonito guts pickled in salt looked and smelled much better than the name would arouse in one's imagination.  as others have mentioned, i really do not understand how this dish was a mere $6.  a heaping bowl filled with a mix of sashimi yellowfin, jackfish, salmon, mackerel, and sprouts each fish was extremely fresh and the sprouts lent some texture to the fleshy-melt-in-your-mouth fishes.  topping the dish, according to my young server, was a combination of the house soy and the vinegar.  adding a bit more soy to the already salty mix made the flavor perfect, in my opinion, though i do believe the dish could have benefited from some daikon or perhaps a crisp starch to add a bit more texture.\n\nthe next dish - well, let's just say it was so good that i ordered a second portion as my main course.  entitled simply <mark>Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard</mark> with foie gras the dish looked simple enough - a miso broth with scallions and a piece of robata duck floating in the broth.  what laid beneath the broth, however, was the true treasure of the dish - a rich and hearty chawanmushi (<mark>Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard</mark>) laden with ample accents of foie gras.  when stirred up with the wooden spoon the foie tones rose amply to the palate with the whole dish tasting like the combination of a sweet <mark>Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard</mark> and an unctuous foie gras terrine.  while the grilled duck added a fine degree of texture to the dish, i personally thought the duck was a slight bit gamey - not bad, just not perfect.  \n\nseeing this dish also offered in the noodle section as an udon accompaniment i inquired from my server as to whether i could get that dish as a main course, but instead substitute the robata foie gras for the duck.  not quite understanding my question my server went and got another server who understood perfectly, asked the chef, and assured me this would be no problem.  receiving this dish after my robata choices and just before dessert i would strongly suggest anyone who attends raku try this substitution for two reasons - number one, the manner in which the robata grill's high temperatures crisps the foie gras exterior while leaving the center fatty and smooth is unlike anything i've previously experienced - the charring actually mellows the foie all on its own and the texture is more \"firm,\" not unlike the roasted version i had at blackbird in chicago, actually.  number two - those udon noodles served thin and cold to be dunked into a broth of foie gras, <mark>Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard</mark>, and more foie gras...think \"chicken soup\" in its perfect form.\n\nbetween my two foie dishes i decided to indulge in a couple of raku's robata skewers - chicken breast with skin.  fresh organic chicken wrapped in its own skin and cooked to crispy this dish presented some of the most <mark>Juicy Deep Fried Chicken</mark> i've had in some time while the addition of the skin added a crisp \"crackle\" without any breading - better than the colonel without all the carbs and oil.  adding first the soy and then the salt i have to say i was quite impressed by the manner in which the matcha's bitter texture worked with the savorieness of the chicken and salt.\n\nrobata course two was kurobuta pork cheek and it, like the chicken, was excellent.  typically quite fatty the high heat of the grill managed to melt the collagen perfectly while burning off some of the fat and only mildly crisping the skin.  the 'rarest' pork i've had since the chop at babbo i found this to be my favorite, tastewise, of the robtata items and would compare it favorably to some of the better pork belly dishes i've had in terms of taste, texture, and fat to meat ratio.\n\nthe third robata course was something i've never eaten - pigs ears.  sure i've had trotters, tail, tete, belly, cheek, and all the standard cuts - but not ear.  as others have stated - wow.  crispy and salty on the outside, fatty next, and a thin chewy layer of cartilage in the middle - almost a 5-layer sandwich with each layer giving a different taste and texture experience.", 
            "a true gem hidden off the vegas strip.  a co-worker recommended this place after eating here every night during his stay here.  i've eaten here once a week so far. \n\nthe izakaya style food is so unique, flavors i've never had before.\n\nmy favorites are the <mark>Poached Egg</mark> with sea urchin and ikura with yamaimo, and of course the homemade tofu special (one is cold and the other is agedashi style). the cold special udon with foie gras chawanmushi style in broth was just exquisite.\n\ni always eat way too much that i can never fit in the desserts i want to try out - fluffly cheesecake. well i'll be sure to try it next week i'm there.  finding hidden gems like this place makes it bearable working here every week on a project in vegas.\n\nby the way, this place closes at 3am!!! and it looks like the owner is expanding his restaurant to the space next door.", 
            "amy c. i must thank you.  i thank you from the bottom of my heart.  you were the last droplets of water in my canteen that got me across the desert and showed me safe passage through las vegas, and helped me avoid the massive amount buffet food and pricey celebrity chef endorsed restaurants that line the strip.  i never expected to find, japanese food that would not only cure my cravings, but also cure my homesickness of living out of a suitcase in a hotel.\n\nwe ordered quite a bit of items, and reviewing my photos, we came  pretty close to about 17 dishes between the three of us, and boy we left full!  i enjoyed each dish that came out but i will highlight a few that were so good, that they almost knocked me out of my seat. \n\nthe <mark>Poached Egg</mark> with sea urchin and salmon roe was from the cold appetizer section, what more could you ask for, three eggs from three different animals are in this dish, throw in nameko mushrooms, and thin slices of okra in a light soy based sauce, you get a dish with an amazing texture.  i'm sure it the type of texture that can horrify some people who aren't used to it, because of the slimy texture that all these ingredients bring to the table, but just by pouring this on our rice, the flavors, the textures it all worked.  i grew up with this texture, and i was instantly swept up in waves of nostalgia from my childhood as i ate this dish.  i loved this dish.\n\nthe fried homemade tofu in hot broth, agedashi dofu is another dish that i love.  and i've had great ones, and quite a few not so great ones, but this one was delicious, it had the consistency and texture you can only get from homemade tofu, additionally, they choose to keep it in a larger block rather then to cut it into smaller cubes for the purpose of allowing you to actually be able to taste the tofu, with the crispy fried batter, swimming in a tentsuyu broth with green onion, salmon roe and nameko mushrooms.  \n\nyaki onigiri was great and i liked how they did the traditional soy sauce one, but then did another one sandwiched in between shiso leaves and a little miso paste.  the only little critique i had on the soy sauce one was i wished they cooked it on the robata grill a little longer, i do like to getting a little char on it and i love to munch on the little crispy bits of rice on my onigiri.  but that is just a personal preference of mine.  \n\ngrilled duck with balsamic soy sauce - the duck was perfectly cooked, it had a little color inside and the balsamic soy sauce provided a nice seasoning and acidity to the dish.\n\nkobe beef fillet with wasabi - i had this in a few steakhouses back in japan.  it took me back.\n\npotato with corn - this dish perplexed me and all of my dinner companions.  it was delicious, but more so we were in deep conversation during the consumption of this and for the duration of our trip, \"how in the world did he do this?\"  we have a couple of ideas in principal, but how the person who did this and executed it so flawlessly, we are honestly still at a loss.  i think just order it, try it and you will see what we were on about. \n\nfor dessert we the sorbet flavors of the day, they had a mandarin sorbet and watermelon sorbet.  i would probably have to say that their sorbet had larger ice crystals, (leading to a texture more similar to a granita siciliana) compared to a sorbet which has smaller ice crystals creating a much smoother texture.  definitions of texture aside, both sorbets were very good and was a nice way to cleanse the pallet.  we also ordered the meltin' and creamy chocolate cake, on our server's recommendation, they make this one to order and they need at least 15-20 minutes to make this dessert, we were in no rush, we were enjoying our meal.  it was basically a molten chocolate cake, and with our first cut with the spoon, it gushed out.  the cake was dense and moist, with the molten fudge inside, and a little green tea ice cream, which complemented the dessert.\n\noverall, i wouldn't have expected to find a restaurant like this all the way out in vegas.  we came for a late dinner, so we had no line, but now that i know that they serve food like this, it's going to be worth the wait.  now if you are the type of person where the words \"all you can eat\" or \"the world's biggest\" sounds appealing, i'm not sure this is the place for you.  but if you like a little variety, and enjoy eating in a tapas style (little plates), believe me, you will leave here full and very satisfied... added bonus you don't have to win big in vegas to eat here, prices for what you get are extremely reasonable.  \n\nthis hidden gem, requires a car or taxi to get off the beaten path in las vegas but it was worth the effort.  i can't wait to go back.  (i already have a wish list on things i want to try next time....)\n\nthank you amy c.!  you saved me.", 
            "omg...i agreed with most of the reviewers that this is the best, the absolute best japanese restaurant...\nfrom the special menu board, we ordered:\n\n-2 sake sampler\n-blue fin tuna sashimi: \n-fried iced fish\n-<mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark>:\n-kobe beef kalbi w/ garlic\n\nfrom the regular menu:\n-<mark>Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard</mark> with foie gras\n-fried pigs ear\n-kobe beef w/ wasabi\n-<mark>Crispy Fried Shrimp</mark>\n-seafood w/ bonito gut\n-oden-daikon, seaweed, deep fried bean curd, stuffed napa cabbage\n-<mark>Poached Egg</mark> w/ sea urchin & salmon roe\n-green tea cream brulee\n\ni must say everything was darn good w/ the exception of oden...first class service, each dish is unique & authentic.....man, i wish i had discover this place earlier...will definite visit every time i come to vegas.",

            "forget korean tacos, hello japanese tapas!\n\nthis was one of my favorite meals in sin city and it was off the strip, tucked in a mini-mall. i was surprised at how hot this restaurant was on yelp because it was tiny and unpretentious... unlike the rest of lv. we had the: \n\n- <mark>Poached Egg</mark> with sea urchin and salmon roe\n- fried homemade tofu in hot broth\n- kobe beef fillet with wasabi\n- kurobuta pork cheek\n- foie gras\n- enoki mushroom wrapped with bacon\n- cold udon noodle with <mark>Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard</mark> soup\n- fluffy cheesecake\n\neverything was small but incredibly flavorful. all the meats danced and melted on my tongue. you know a restaurant is a winner when it can charge $10 for tofu and i can leave without bitching, whining, or crying. the only item that i wouldn't order again is the cheesecake, but then again--i should've known better than to get that at a charcoal grill.\n\ni wish raku would move to sf... because i'm not that interested in relocating to lv.", 
            "one word:  outstanding!!!\n\ndiscovering raku is like learning how to play craps for the first time and winning a ton of money at the same time!  i certainly felt like a winner after having dined at raku ... and much like my first experience with the game of craps ... i cannot wait to go back and play / eat some more!\n\nraku is best known for their tapas style dishes that consist mostly of high-quality meat on skewers grilled over \"japanese charcoal\".  the food was outstanding ... and we certainly tried as many small dishes as we can possibly fit into our stomachs the night we visited.  a couple of my favorites included the following:  bacon wrapped asparagus, <mark>Poached Egg</mark> with uni and salmon roe, kobe beef liver, live uni with udon, fried tofu in hot broth, and the grilled foie gras.  the home-made tofu in hot broth was truly amazing - i would definitely say that it was the best preparation of tofu that i have ever had ... it'll take the pepsi challenge against any other tofu on the planet any ol' day of the freakin' week - that's for sure. the live uni (that was alive up until a few seconds before they serve it to you on the plate) was equally as good especially when mixed with the thin udon noodles.  lastly ... who would've thought that foie gras would taste so amazingly good coming out of a japanese restaurant ... certainly not i.\n\nthere are so many great restaurants that are popping out in vegas that i find it difficult to come back for a second visit despite how good my first experience was.  bouchon for breakfast is certainly an exception and raku will soon fall into that category.  i cannot wait to sample some more of their extensive menu despite the temptation of other restaurants in sin city.  i just hope that, unlike my subsequent visits to the craps table, i continue to win at raku grill.", 
            "of course i would find a dying need to write my first review a day before my test on fungal agents/vaccinations/immunosuppressants. typical. this is an upgrade from my last procrastination activity though- online shoe browsing. \n\neveryone has already commented on how this is located in some obscure, dark corner of a strip mall so i'll skip onto the juicy stuff.\n\nso, the first negative thing i have to note is that my body went through an msg overload after we left the restaurant. my bf and i must have been on the brink of dehydration for hours after the meal (no thanks to the casinos- there are zero water fountains on the strip), but judging from the volume of food we had & the inescapable dashi seasoning in japanese food, that sounds about right. we had a feast. and all for ~$60 for 2. \n\nhighlights: \n<mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark>- fried on the outside for some bite and texture, so buttery soft on the inside, sitting in dashi broth. \n\nkobe beef tendon- a thousand times yes! this was our favorite. the tendon was fresh and just melts in your mouth. \n\nkurobuta pork cheek\n\nchicken breast wrapped with chicken skin- salted, crispy skin + juicy morsel of chicken. \n\nfluffy cheesecake- ok, the description is really lacking here. its really a mousse of cheesecake sitting on top of a thin layer of very finely cubed fruit! and on top of a dark chocolate? cookie crust, garnished with some raspberries, a little raspberry sauce, and green tea powder. it was so light and refreshing, i savored every single bite. \n\nskip: \n<mark>Poached Egg</mark> w/sea urchin & salmon roe- the description fails to say it basically sits in a mucous-y okra broth. \n\npotato corn- i get the novelty but once you get over wondering how this came to be, you realize youre getting ripped for a small morsel of bland veggies. \n\nbutter saut\\u00e9ed scallop with soy sauce- salty, small, a smidgen overcooked, $7.00. i mean, with that price you could buy two orders of the beef tendon...\n\ntips: \n- call for reservations. a party of 4 was turned away in the beginning of the night and was told that it was completely booked for the night. it was a tuesday so yeah, plan ahead. \n- the bathroom's cute. it's got a cute forest theme going on. \n\nvery very memorable meal. i have tons of pictures (not sure how to upload) but i'm already moving on to my next procrastination activity- dexter.",

            "raku raku i am so in love with you! i hope to return many times! i dined here last week to celebrate my birthday with a friend who was also celebrating hers. she had been there a few times before so she was more familiar with the menu. we enjoyed:\n\ncocktails: green tea sake cocktail and a lychee sake cocktail. amazing!!! the lychee flavored one was sweet and smooth and glided down my throat. my friend said the green tea one was equally delish. (we were shocked to find out that they were only $6 each when we got our bill).\n\npork cheek: it was clearly a fatty piece of meat grilled to perfection. there was no greasiness, no gelatinous masses, just firm texture and awesome flavor. \n\ntofu: we ordered half cold and half in the hot broth. my friend knew she liked them both and could split the order like that. the cold tofu was nicely complemented by the different ingredients it is served with. you can add your own homemade salt, fresh ginger, seaweed, etc. it was fun seeing how much fresh ginger i could actually handle in one bite. the texture of the tofu is creamy yet firm and yielding. the hot tofu was firmer around the edges and a much richer taste derived from the broth it's floating in. they were both equally gratifying. they each satisfied a different craving, one: light creamy and spiced with added flavors, the other: warm, rich and robust. \n\n<mark>Poached Egg</mark> with see urchin and salmon roe: this was probably my favorite dish. i loved the intermingling of the delicate flavors of the very basic egg yolk, the salty salmon roe and the subtly sweet sea urchin. the tiny button mushrooms in the broth were a perfect accompaniment. i loved the few pieces of okra and the flavor it added to the overall dish. it was a very well executed play on texture and flavor. \n\nenoki mushrooms wrapped in bacon: wow, not only were they a treat for the eyes, but a treat for the taste buds as well. the smoky grill flavor really shined through these little morsels. \n\nsawagani (japanese river crab): the crabs were very crunchy! they had a nice flavor as well, but i would say the novelty here is the crunchiness and the sight of them all lined up. \n\nasparagus tempura: this was not the normal tempura batter i'm used to, but more of a nutty rice crispy texture. the asparagus was al dente (just like i like it) and the nutty flavor combined with the asparagus was a match made in heaven. \n\nblue fin tuna sashimi: melt in your mouth, creamy fresh fish! i've never tasted better! this was well worth the $25 price.\n\ngreen tea ice cream: it was creamy and deliciously sweet. \n\nthe sights and smells of this place make it a restaurant with not only amazing food but amazing atmosphere as well. i thoroughly enjoyed the prompt and courteous service. i can't wait to go back!!!",

            "of all the cities, bars, restaurants and otherwise i've indulged my way through as a result of yelp-scouting, raku sits alone as my shining star. a few come close (uchi in austin comes to mind) but none quite capture the same balance of satisfaction vs. value vs. location that raku does. it is, my greatest yelp. \n\nwhen you can ride 200 reviews to a nearly flawless five star rating i feel little need to chronicle the intricacies of the place. just know that it's about a $10 cab ride (each way) from the strip, is quite small (with a couple of quaint private rooms) so reservations are recommended and it hands down serves the best food i've had in sin city until an honest 3am. \n\ni was in vegas this past week for an extended bachelor party and had narrowed down my \"must-do\" list to raku from an initial pool of about 12 reccomendations on yelp. while i eventually did manage to hit 3 or 4 candidate restaurants i suspected that i might only have one shot at a chance to steal away from the guys (not foodies) and see what the place was all about. it absolutely did not disappoint. \n\ni grabbed a seat at the five or six occupancy bar and immediately made friends with a cute japanese girl who as it turned out was something of a fixture. she helped me through the menu (and three bottles of sake) from 11pm until after 3am as well as acted as intermediatary between myself and the owner. whether or not he actually spoke english or just found my position amusing i don't know, but even without speaking to each other directly he was a cheery and fun guy. \n\nto satisfy my own memory i'll try and list everything i had. all were amazing, a few spectacular.\n\n-seafood with bonito guts pickled in salt\n-fresh kobe beef liver with garlic (had it sashimi style, also available seared)\n-<mark>Poached Egg</mark> with sea urchin and salmon roe\n-fried homemade tofu in hot broth (best tofu i've ever had, in amazing broth with salmon roe)\n-raku's tofu (unfried version of above, served with green tea salt and spicy vinegar, had a half portion of each)\n-steamd <mark>Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard</mark> with foie gras (holy crap, maybe my favorite)\n-chicken thigh (perfectly seasoned and grilled, on skewers, wow)\n-mushrooms (small, brown and marinated then grilled, don't remember much else)\n-ayu kanro-ni (caramely whole river fish marinated in soy/sake/mirin and wrapped in banana leaf)\n-crispy chicken knees (sort of a chewier version of pork cracklins'...dude!)\n-some sort of sweet/salty rice cracker sticks\n-asparagus grilled and crusted with rice cracker\n-asian pear sorbet (holy freaking crap...utterly amazing)\n\ndishes ran anywhere from $3 up to about $12 for the foie gras and kobe liver. with three bottles of sake (no idea what they were, my dining companion picked three different ones), approx. 15 dishes (i'm forgetting a few), a $40 tip and some cash to the chef behind the grill/bar, i was still out of there for just a little over $200. \n\nmy best advice if you find yourself within 200 miles of vegas is eat here, at all costs, if you're at all into japanese pub food. it's the best experience i've had in this country. if you speak any japanese this is a great place to use it. that can be a mistake at most of the nice/trendy sushi places around the us where the majority of employees hail from other parts of asia. but at raku a boisterous \"itadakimasu!\" will be greeted with cheers; everyone is straight out of nihon.\n\noh and don't miss the specials board, 10 or so off-menu options that comprised most of my favorite selections.", 
            "we had an amazing meal here on wednesday night.   it was my second time here.  the first time was before they did the renovation.   it's a lot bigger now (yay!) \nwe started off with a bottle of demon slayer one of my favorite sakes.   \nwe ordered a bunch of stuff off the specials board.  the portion sizes are great.  the sashimi special came with about 8 pieces of regular pieces and 3 or four smaller thinner pieces.  the shima aji sashimi, so delicious and melted in my mouth!  i will go back just for the shima aji...sooo good. \nthe kobe beef tataki, amazing!  tender and flavorful.  came with about 10 pieces of beef.    \nwe also got the braised pork belly which makes my mouth water just thinking about it right now! it came with 4 pieces of pork belly with a sauce drizzled on top in a broth with some greens.   the last thing we got off the specials board was the ayu kanroni.  hmm...we got it because it sounded interesting, but it wasn't our favorite. it was a whole marinated sweet fish that was cold.  it wasn't bad, just different, i think i was expecting a hot dish.    \nwe got the <mark>Poached Egg</mark> with sea urchin which is a visually stunning dish and tasty as well.  from the grill we got shishito peppers and chicken breast with skin.  both tasty as well.  unfortunately they were out of the corn stuffed with potato.  for dessert we ordered green tea creme brulee and green tea ice cream.  we didn't realize the creme brulee already comes with a scoop of ice cream. but both were sooo good!  \nso an amazing dinner for 2 with a big bottle of sake and dessert came out to $140.  what a great deal!  \nno celebrity chef spottings this time, but last time rick moonen from top chef masters was sitting next to us!", 
            "this might be our favorite restaurant experience of all time.  hidden in a strip mall, raku instantly surprises you with decor that is modern and stylish and yet reminiscent of a traditional restaurant in japan.\n\nthe food is truly amazing here.  a mix of standard and original dishes, smartly conceived, and expertly prepared with very fresh ingredients.  every offering is an adventure in flavor and texture.  i've often wondered what it must be like to sit at the judges' table of the original iron chef, but i can't imagine it's much better than having a meal at raku.\n\nsome highlights:\n\n<mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark>: creamy and smooth tofu delicately fried and served in a savory broth.  loved it, and i don't even particularly like tofu.\n\n<mark>Poached Egg</mark> with sea urchin and salmon roe, with okra and daikon and mushrooms and broth: so much contrast between the different ingredients, and yet it all makes for a great dish.\n\n<mark>Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard</mark>: heavenly.\n\ngrilled foie gras: sinful.\n\n<mark>Sashimi Salad</mark>: very fresh fish on a bed of greens, lovely dressing, crispy fried onion topping.\n\nfluffy cheesecake: beautifully presently, wonderfully light.  a sublime finish.\n\nthe wait staff was very welcoming, friendly, responsive, and helpful.  on top of everything else, the portions are relatively large, and the prices are quite affordable for the quality of food.  my wife and i had about 9 different dishes, were totally satisfied, and made it out with a total bill under $100.\n\nvisit both restrooms.  very pleasant and surprising.\n\nif you're in vegas, forgo the restaurants on the strip and visit raku.", 
            "raku is what i would call las vegas' most avant garde japanese izakaya in the city. the food at the restaurant is about as authentic and minimal as any restaurant on the japanese islands themselves. the chef of the restaurant is well renowned for making his own tofu and soy sauce and the dedication to his craft shows in every dish that is served in raku. \n\nthe ambiance of the place is cozy while maintaining an air of exclusiveness that most patrons seem to relish in. although it's no longer the prized hidden jewel of the city, most people that give raku frequent patronage still regard the small restaurant as a secret treasure. \n\nthe menu is interesting and filled with unique ingredients that are designed for more sophisticated palates. if fois gras, beef liver, sea urchins, tendons, and pork ears are all new to your culinary vocabulary, raku might not be the place for you.\n\nthe \"<mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark>\" is the must have item on the menu. traditionally, <mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark> is a type of battered tofu that is fried until the outside is golden brown and then served with tentsuyu broth, grated daikon (type of asian radish), and bonito flakes. the raku specialty way of making <mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark> is unrivaled with any other restaurant in the city that offers the same selection.\n\nthe <mark>Poached Egg</mark> with uni (sea urchin) and ikura (salmon caviar), is another absolute favorite. the silky and rich smoothness of the uni paired with the buttery thickness of the bursting egg yolk goes perfectly with the salty pop given off by the ikura. \n\nraku offers a decent selection of japanese sake for you to sample. a lot of women tend to love the sparkling sakes that they offer here. as a note of advice to all sake drinkers, do not order hot sake or ask them to heat a bottle of cold sake. the japanese heat lower grade sake to mask its flaws. anytime one heats alcohol, it renders the characteristics of the alcohol obsolete and thus any sake served hot is because it is ultimately a low quality sake that isn't worth drinking cold.", 
            "so glad we trusted the reviews and came here! such a find!\n\na cute little place with lovely service. we ordered the fresh tofu (out of this world, a must order), the crispy <mark>Juicy Deep Fried Chicken</mark> (so good), sashimi, whole black snapper, pork intestine, pork ear (yum!), <mark>Poached Egg</mark> with sea urchin (this was really great). and the sake recommendation was delightful. \n\na fantastic experience!!",

            "yes it's true, the restaurant has an air of la snob. \n\ndon't even think about walking in without an reservation, it's impossible to get a seat even though a lot of seats may look empty. apparently, there are \"reservations.\" we saw this happen to many people and we also attempted at it once.\n\nwe were 10 minutes early for our reservation but since the restaurant hadn't technically \"opened\" yet, we were made to wait outside in the grimy chinatown sidewalk. which was fine. then we saw 4 international guests walk out of the restaurant fully fed and intoxicated. these guys were probably friends with the chef/owner or were especially special guests because the staff were farewelling them and all this fancy stuff. this was fine too. so we were the only 2 waiting outside and finally the restaurant had opened but we weren't sure if we could enter because the door was still closed and the hostess didn't invite us in. so we waited some more and finally we thought screw it let's go inside. we got in and there was no \"thank you for waiting\" courtesy and the chef was standing around in his undershirt. finally, we got seated and i have to admit i started dinner a little bit aggravated and unsure why i was here. \n\nthe cold service was quickly forgotten as i dove into our first dish (kanpachi), then our second, then our third, fourth, fifth...twelveth. the food was ridiculously delicious -- japanese food taken to another level! the service gets better once you are seated and you order food. the waitress describes and food and is polite.\n\nmy favorite items:\n1. raku's tofu - homemade, best tofu i've ever eaten\n2. <mark>Sashimi Salad</mark> - the dressing is superb\n3. kobe beef outside skirt with garlic - obviously this is going to be awesome!\n4. butter saut\\u00e9ed scallop with soy sauce - i wished i ordered more of this dish. sharing one was simply not enough for me!\n5. daily special: kanpachi - super fresh\n6. daily special: blue crab miso soup - you can actually taste both ingredients.\n\nmaybe will order again:\n1. melting chocolate cake - if i have room, i'd order this again\n2. green tea creme brulee - this one was standard, nothing special\n\nwouldn't order again:\n1. <mark>Poached Egg</mark> with sea urchin and salmon roe - visually and ideally appealing but the texture creeped me out. i thought i was eating really flavorful phlegm. \n2. <mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark> - raku's tofu was better because the simple ingredients enhanced the tofu. the agedashi was a bit overpowered by sauce. \n3. oyako don chicken and egg - i don't think it's a dish you should order at a restaurant like this\n4. oyster isobeyaki - the way it was grilled made the oyster way too chewy for my taste. and, i didn't like the crispy seaweed accompanying it. \n\nalso, if you have time check out my photos of all the things we ate!", 
            "this place is a must if you are a foodie and you are in vegas.  we were in vegas for a week and decided to find restaurants off the strip.  we were so happy to find this place and enjoyed everything they had to offer.  <mark>Poached Egg</mark> with sea urchin was just amazing and enoki mushroom wrapped in bacon is delicious.  i really am impressed with the owner/chef who walks around checking and tasting some dishes with his chopsticks and spoon on his shoulder.  scallop, fresh tofu, and even house sake tastes so great, my next visit to vegas, i took my co-workers there.\n\nvery clean, great bathroom, atmosphere, and awesome desert, this place is a hidden gem in vegas.", 
            "my wife and i began our 10 year anniversary weekend with visit to raku as we drove into vegas at 1:45 am on friday night (saturday morning, actually).  fortunately for us, the kitchen was making its last call and we still had time to order.\n\nbest dishes:\n<mark>Poached Egg</mark> with sea urchin (salmon roe, jalapeno, mushrooms, mountain root in soba broth served cold) - amazing well constructed with a perfectly <mark>Poached Egg</mark> and various layers of flavor that all worked together.  a bargain at $9.\nfoie gras chawanmushi (<mark>Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard</mark> with a hint of foie gras, smoked duck and black truffle) - creamy, rich, delicious!  $10\n<mark>Juicy Deep Fried Chicken</mark> (six medallions of chicken, fried, over a bed of baby spinach) - we weren't going to order this, but our waitress highly recommended it, and we're glad she did. $9\nenoki mushroom with bacon - great flavor from the grill and a thick, lean, juicy cut of bacon. $2.80 for two.\nkamo grilled duck (with balsamic soy sauce) - tender, well seasoned, and not gamey at all.\n\ngood dishes:  <mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark>, momo chicken thigh, grilled veal\n\ndisappointing:  kobe beef with wasabi (surprisingly ordinary), tontoro kurobuta pork cheek (too fatty for our taste), <mark>Sashimi Salad</mark> (expected more from raku)\n\nregarding some topics raised by other reviewers:\nprice.  we thought the prices were quite reasonable for a restaurant of this quality.\nservice.  for the most part, the wait staff was pleasant and informative.  they were not very attentive - we did have to ask for refills, etc.  but, because the restaurant was small and not crowded, it was fairly easy to get their attention.\n\noverall, this was a great meal and a fantastic way to start our 10th anniversary weekend.", 
            "i can validate this place is the hot spot for the top chefs in town.  not only did we enjoy a delicious, innovative meal, but we dined right after andrew zimmern from bizzare foods was there eating and filming his show!  he even gave us tips on what to eat.  in summary, he said we couldn't go wrong with pretty much anything on the menu, and he was right.\n\nwe ate crispy asparagus encrusted w/ japanese crackers, sea urchin with <mark>Poached Egg</mark> and roe, foie gras rice bowl, duck skewer w/ balsamic soy sauce, kobe beef filet w/ wasabi, skewer of chicken fat and homemade fried tofu in broth. to top off the evening, i spent some quality time in the japanese washroom complete with an aquarium and heated seat toilet w/ bidet and dryer. what a way to end our trip.  that part of town is way-cool (chinatown) and i want to go back to raku, then eat my way down the road, stopping off at each place for a snack.", 
            "i am in love with this place.  i am jealous of everyone who is going to vegas or will be going to vegas since they have the opportunity to eat at raku while i'm at home, reminiscing my memories of how fabulous this meal was and how i would like to go again.  \n\nwe ordered a variety of dishes - each being very delicious and mouthwatering.  the stand out dishes we had that night would be:\n\n1)  oden - oh how subtle yet so flavorful the broth is.  i loved being able to customize what goes inside the oden.  \n2)  foie gras with glazed soy-base sauce - i typically don't like foie gras but the soy sauce glaze and the grill made the meat so flavorful and very delicious way.  so good.\n3)  <mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark> - the tofu was freshly made and just melted in your mouth.  \n\nthough truthfully, everything that we ordered was so amazing.  the one dish i really wanted to try but they ran out of was the <mark>Poached Egg</mark> with sea urchin and salmon roe.  i'm hoping to get that the next time i'm in vegas!", 
            "i came without a reservation on thursday evening around 7:30 pm and lucked out - i  was seated at the counter.\n\ni hadn't ordered the omakase here before so went that route. here's what i received:\n<mark>Tofu Salad</mark> with seaweed - refreshing \namberjack sashimi with sliced radish - incredible!\nrobata grilled cherry tomatoes - yummy\nyellowtail skewer with soy based sauce and minced daikon - awesome tasting\n<mark>Juicy Deep Fried Chicken</mark> with spinach - crispy on the outside so tender and flavorful\nkobe beef skewer with garlic - stellar\nib\\u00e9rico de bellota pork skewer - best pork i've eaten\ncold green soba noodles with <mark>Poached Egg</mark> - so refreshing\n\nas previous encounters at raku, i was totally satisfied and content with the quality, taste and value of my dinning experience. the service here is stellar. yes the meal took over a 90 minutes but everything is prepared to order. my only con that evening was i was unable to finish my soba noodles bc i was to full!", 
            "i ate at raku at the recommendation of my friend ryan.  raku is located off spring mountain road in chinatown. let me start by saying that this place has amazing food. we arrived promptly at around midnight but didnt actually get seated til about 12:30am or so.  it would have been five stars had their service been better. \n\nwe started with a salad of some sort, which was fresh and marinaded and was delightful.  we then had the iberico carpaccio, which had the iberico with a layer of gelatinous fat on top and melts away when you eat it.  it was one of the highlights of the night. it was a special so when we tried to order it again later that night, it was sold out. \nthe <mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark> was delicious. soft tofu with a good broth that provides the tofy with alot of flavor.  <mark>Poached Egg</mark> with sea urchin was a hit, it includes <mark>Poached Egg</mark>, sea urchin, okra, mushrooms, salmon roe, in a broth. kobe beef filet was tender and the wasabi touch was the right amount of spice to the kobe beef. the chicken teba wing had a good crust and was tender and flavorful.  the toro tataki was soft and buttery and was fantastic but we had gotten the last order.  the pork cheek was fatty and full of flavor.  the negitoro was ok and didnt blow me away like most of the other dishes.  <mark>Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard</mark> was excellent.", 
            "pretty amazing. \n\nwe roll in thursday night past midnight. i'm pretty sure we were the only fatties there when we were done eating.   my favorite includes the grilled rice ball (pure bliss!), green tea soba noodles, and the uni, with <mark>Poached Egg</mark>, daikon and mushroom.  it had a wonderful texture of silky, soft, crunchy, smoky, sweet and creamy.  quite delicious.   everything is super fresh...super pure, neatly presented... as i would agree with my friend yee, the plate served here is a work of art.  our friend knew exactly what to order...so pretty much everything he ordered was spot on.  \n\ni can go on and on and on.... the next time i go back, i def want to hit up their omakase.  it's unfortunate we didn't have much time. my only regret is not being able to take my time... everything felt a bit rushed...\n\nraku is off the strip of vegas...nothing fancy, but definitely not to be missed...", 
            "this place was one of the better places we had the opportunity to enjoy during our vegas trip (although i almost killed myself when i leaned on what i thought was the hostess stand and almost busted my behind).\n\nthe waitstaff was pleasant, friendly, and very helpful.  one of them went through the entire specials board and explained each and every dish, which was really nice.\n\nwe ordered the following:\n\n<mark>Poached Egg</mark> with uni and salmon roe\ntoday's ohitashi\n<mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark>\ntsukune skewer\nkobe beef skirt with garlic skewer\nkobe beef tendon skewer\nkurobuta pork cheek skewer\npork ear\napple marinated lamb chop \nsaikyoyaki special\nveal skewer special\nmelting chocolate cake\nfluffy cheesecake\n\nmy bf could not bring himself to try the egg with uni and salmon roe only because of the slimey texture of it all, but he did try everything else (i loved the dish by the way).  we loved everything  except for the kobe beef tendon...a little too fatty, rich, mushy, sticky for our taste.  everything else was yum-o!\n\nthis place is a short cab ride from the vegas strip and the waitress will call a cab for you when you're finished with your meal...now that's service.  we would defitnitely go back!  i'm so glad i found the izakaya in vegas......i thought i can only have it in nyc!", 
            "following other postings, i made my reservations plenty early (10 days ahead).  service was good.  they did take the time to explain the whole specials menu from which we picked 3-4 items and the rest from the regular menu.  surprisingly, some of the simpliest dishes were the best including bacon wrapped tamatoes and mushrooms.  i had the <mark>Poached Egg</mark> with ikura and uni just to try something on the expensive side.  good but not much more spetacular than what you'd expect from such ingredients.  the stars of the night was the lamb chops, kurobota pork cheeks, and <mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark>...in that order.  everything else was still good but i may come back next time and get nothing but lamb chops.    will definitely go again as there were plenty on the menu still to be tried.", 
            "i've been reading all the wonderful reviews and great press that raku has gotten and have been dreaming of visiting for about 3 years. finally, for my birthday this year, i got my husband to take me.\nwe made reservations, and it's a good thing we did because the restaurant is tiny - like maybe 20 diners can sit down at tables and 4 more at the bar, tiny. we got an early table (hey, we have a little baby at home!) and we saw two groups come and leave because they couldn't get a table.\nfirst, the drinks: an excellent selection of sake with a very informative menu, and a handful of bottled japanese beers (and not just asahi, either!). we both had new beers and they were both good; prices were average ($7-8).\nfor our meal, we started with the oft-reviewed hot and cold tofus. i thought the cold was really delicious, and the green tea salt and house soy sauce really made the dish pop. the hot was just meh. we didn't finish it. my husband is a miso soup lover, so he got a bowl of it and it was good, but just miso soup. it was packed with tofu, so after that, we were feeling kinda tofu-ed out. next up were the specials (a blue-fin tuna and a yellowtail dish). they were both really good and the dishes completely came together with all the accompaniments. i always like blue-fin tuna and yellowtail, but these dishes were a cut above. almost up to nobu status, i think. \nthen we branched out with something kind of adventurous - uni with <mark>Poached Egg</mark> and salmon roe. wow, it was so mushy and runny, i had to force down the second bite - ew (but that's just me). finally, we got the <mark>Juicy Deep Fried Chicken</mark> (good, but not the best <mark>Juicy Deep Fried Chicken</mark> i've had by a long shot) and the skewers of duck (thumbs up for that one). \nthe final bill came out to about $135 with tip.\nmy overall thought is that it's good and i'm really glad i went to experience it once, but i'll probably never go back since i didn't love all the food and it's expensive. \nalso, i'm not sure, but i may not be cut out to eat the food they actually eat in japan.", 
            "loved the foie gras yakitori (since ca banned it, this is heaven!), age tofu was out of this world and they made the tofu in house fresh, topped with ikura <mark>Sunomono - Cucumber And Seaweed</mark> and the broth was just nice, not too salty or sweet. very delicate! <mark>Poached Egg</mark> with sea urchin and ikura was very tasty and super duper fresh! chicken teba wing was juicy and crispy on the outside, nice. kurobuta pork cheek was the best, tender and not too salty, and crispy. oden was just ok, i had better one. the butter sauteed scallop with soy sauce was devine (a bit small for $7). we came at 11:30 midnight because they were super small and busy. a lot of items were sold out, so bummed. we wanted to try the <mark>Juicy Deep Fried Chicken</mark>, <mark>Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard</mark>, kobe beef tongue, oyakodon, green soba, the little hot pot on small fire stove, and <mark>Crispy Fried Shrimp</mark>. oh, they had 2 bathrooms, the prettiest i have ever seen! the sea ocean theme with aquarium and nice ocean ceiling, lighting and wall, and nice bedat seat. the other bathroom was a jungle theme with rose petals, big tree trunk and leaves flowers ceiling, with bird chipping music, so soothing! a definite must try in vegas!!!!",

            "been here 2 times now and both times they were equally amazing. this last time i made a reservation for 4 ppl and it was funny because when you make a reservation they tell you that your party has 2.5 hours to dine and they hold your reservation for 15 mins past the reso time otherwise they give up the table. anyhow arrived early and table was ready. server came over right away and greeted from entire restaurant staff including sushi chef when we sat down. server explained specials in detail and was quite knowledgeable about the sake list which was a nice surprise. in fact we were debating between 3 sakes so she brought out a shot glass of each one and the bottle so we could try all 3. amazing touch of service that takes up time for the server and costs them $ but being all about service they still do that. one of the best touches i have seen in quite a long time. highly impressed. server gave great recommendations about the food and they were all right on point. <mark>Poached Egg</mark> with uni wow amazing!!! scallop in butter great flavors slightly overcooked but still great dish. age dashi tofu was terrific and they gave bowls and small spoons for all of us. sashimi is some of the freshest in town in my eyes and ive been to most japanese restaurants in las vegas including high end ones on strip. foie gras = one of the best things ive had in town hands down top 15 dishes in town. but then again 3 of the other dishes are also foie from other restaurants.\n\nall food was spectacular, they bring dishes out in a nice time frame so your not overwhelmed with food and the hot food wont get cold sitting on the table. service was great, they filled up water glasses consistently which is one of the main things i look for in restaurants. friendly service and they checked up on the table throughout the meal. great job changing out plates when necessary and gave us all bowls and small spoons like i mentioned for certain courses such as the tofu course. overall it was amazing and no they didnt kick us out after 2.5 hours. definitely will go again soon. side note they always say see you later when leaving some restaurants drop the check and thats it but not this one. its the little things raku does and does right.", 
            "in a city where i've had subpar asian eats, my experiences at raku has been on another level. when it was first recommended to me, i expected it to be part of the strip like any other high end eatery, and one that was in the confines of a casino resort. instead, it is a japanese establishment in the splendors of chinatown.\n\nmy expectations were surprisingly low the first time around. i haven't had incredible experiences of the japanese kind in vegas just yet, plus i was less likely to put faith in a place that was more asian fusion than pure japanese as raku seems to be. and in the seediness of chinatown no less? i was already beginning to doubt its $$$$ rating.\n\nbut thankfully, my expectations were not only met but exceeded in every way. everything was truly spectacular, from the small plates to the entrees and it was hard to pass up anything considering how fresh and tasty it all was. stars of the initial evening were bold cuts of sashimi, namely blue fin tuna, coupled by an incredible array of tofu dishes and one dish that would make any seafood lover salivate: fresh uni with salmon roe, topped off by a perfectly <mark>Poached Egg</mark>.\n\nit has been several visits since then and all is right with the world. client dinners have been nothing short of amazing and my personal escapades have resulted in a lot of experimentation with the menu. i've become enamored with a live uni udon, their daily blue crab miso soup, and their array of skewered meats. kobe beef, chicken skin, and pork cheek have been favorites in all izakaya circles.\n\nthe service, ambiance, and overall visits have been excellent to the t. las vegas is lucky to be home to so many wonderful establishments, but raku is certainly one of their shiniest gems in the desert. 5 stars and nothing less.", 
            "no doubt, one of the best meals i have ever had!\n\n\n--started off with the <mark>Poached Egg</mark> with sea urchin and salmon roe.  personally, i am a big fan of uni so i had to get this dish.  i thought it was great but the sliminess especially when mixed altogether with nameko mushrooms and okras definitely took a little getting used to.  only if there were more texture to counter the offputting consistency, this dish would have been excellent.\n\n--next was <mark>Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard</mark>.  this dish was really interesting since i have never had foie gras integrated with <mark>Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard</mark> before.  the taste is on point with that creamy foie gras texture one would look for.  i decided to give the duck topping to my girl since i annihilated the robata grilled duck.  she said i missed out and should order another so that i could give it a try.\n\n--their <mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark> received rave reviews so we decided to give it a try.  the dish itself has great flavors and the fact that it is homemade makes it that much better!\n\n--also ordered a couple items from their robata grill menu:  \nkobe beef fillet with wasabi [alright]\nkobe beef liver [good]\nkurobuta pork cheek [really good]\npork ear [good]\nduck with balsamic soy sauce [life changing]\n\n--ended the meal with green tea cr\\u00e8me brul\\u00e9e and hot tea.\n\n\noverall experience?  raku is definitely one of the top contenders for japanese cuisine in las vegas.  i enjoyed how great the service was especially since their employees were friendly and helpful--explained everything regarding the restaurant's menu and other daily specials.  as far as the ambiance goes, dining at this place made me feel as if i were actually at a restaurant in japan while eating some really great authentic japanese cuisine.  the restaurant itself is quite small so make sure you make a reservation.  i would certainly come back to try some of their off-menu dishes and maybe even try their \"omakase\" menu.  oh yea, did anybody else notice that huge tree in the bathroom?! ha", 
            "raku is one of my favorite restaurants for a number of reasons.  great things happen when i eat here and the food is excellent. to celebrate a special occasion, i went here. we were considering getting the omakase for $100/person but that's like a lottery - you don't know what items you'll get. although i've never had anything i didn't like from this place, we had specific things we wanted to try. \n\nmy faves:\nkobe beef filet with wasabi, kobe beef outside skirt with garlic, duck with balsamic soy sauce, foie gras with glazed soy-base sauce, asparagus with bacon, enoki mushroom wrapped with bacon and green tea creme brulee. i love their blue fin sashimi but we didn't order that this time.\n\naside from my faves, we also tried raku's homemade tofu, juicy deep-<mark>Juicy Deep Fried Chicken</mark>, <mark>Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard</mark>, chicken breast wrapped with chicken skin, kobe beef silver skin, iberico pork and kanpachi kama.\n\nhomemade tofu:\ncan be ordered in half or full portions. comes with ginger, green onions and bonito. the texture of the tofu is so different from all the tofu i've ever had. it has the consistency of formed cottage cheese. 4.5/5\n\njuicy deep-<mark>Juicy Deep Fried Chicken</mark>:\ncrispy skin, juicy fatty chicken. absolutely delicious! 5/5\n\n<mark>Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard</mark>:\nthis dish has the same broth as in <mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark>. this chawanmushi has a mild foie gras taste to it and has a piece of duck on top. 5/5\n\nchicken breast wrapped with chicken skin:\nslightly crisp chicken skin seasoned with salt. for some reason, i really liked the simplicity of this dish. 5/5\n\nkobe beef silver skin:\na bit oily and sweet. this is the skin of a cow put on a skewer and grilled. 4/5\n\niberico pork:\ni love jamon iberico and i was thinking this would be similar. but this is actual chunks of pork with a yummy sauce and grilled. 5/5\n\nkanpachi kama:\nperfectly grilled amberjack collar with a nice ponzu/soy dipping sauce. although i was not in the mood for fish, i still think this is the best kama in town. very meaty, moist (terrible word) and perfectly cooked. 5/5\n\nalthough the last time we went here, they didn't have 2 items we wanted: <mark>Poached Egg</mark> w/ sea urchin and salmon roe and, hamachi kama. they also changed their decor. they replaced hello kitty with a pig with a big mouth - creepy looking mofo! i'd still come back here regardless...", 
            "small place! reservations highly recommended!\nthey turned away 6 parties as  i was there because they could not accomadate.\n\ndecor : very cute dark lighting woodsy feel. very nice intimate setting.\n\nthink tapas. small bites but a whole lot of flavor. =d\n\nfoie gras w/soy sauce glaze - yum! omg! if i could describe this correctly, it is like a melt in your mouth with a soft glaze and crispy outer shell. like perfect! so good!\n\nkurobuta pork cheek skewer - yum. the cheek is soo meaty and juicy and good. =d\n\nkobe beef filet skewer w/ wasabi - yes please! the meat the meat seasoned perfectly, it was so good. the wasabi mind you was real wasabi w/ real bits in there to clear up those sinuses!! \n\n<mark>Poached Egg</mark> custard with uni - good. <mark>Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard</mark> was very light and fluffy. made perfectly, topped with uni and some daikon? radishes. it was good, but i felt like the uni portion was very small comparable to the egg proportion. the daikon radish, gave it some texture, but i am not sure if it complemented the dish as much. i iked the okra slices. =d yay for okra!\n\n<mark>Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard</mark> - ehh. i felt like the egg overpowered the foie gras taste, but you can still taste it. it was a large proportion of egg to foi gras. it was still good, but not as great.\n\nscallop w/soy sauce glaze - good. i liked the scallop with presentation. it was cooked perfectly, however i felt the soy sauce glaze was a little salty with the scallop, but it was still good. \n\nwagyu beef sashimi w/raw wasabi & beef infused soy sauce - omg. heaven. so good. the meat was like butter where it just melts in your mouth and isn't too overpowering with the wasabi. the wasabi was very good. the soy sauce was infused with beef as well. whatttt!!! you can actually taste the flavors.\n\ngreen tea creme brulee - good! yum. it is actual green tea creme brulee. the texture was perfect and the green tea flavor did not overpower. it was very good.\n\ni would have went to sweets by raku next door, but it was closed by the time i finished dinner. find the big spoon on the wall since they don't have a sign yet.\n\noverall: definitely coming back. comparable price & quality wise, it is about the same price as a vegas buffet, but man,  the quality is just superior. this place is totally worth it over a buffet anyday. i still dream of the food. it's not weird right? ^__^", 
            "since my initial visit during their first year opened, i've been back a handful of times and felt it was time i updated my review.  \n\nraku is the kind of place we usually reserve for special occasions and recommend to out of town guests.  our most recent visit was only last week as the husband and i celebrated our five year wedding anniversary.\n\nwe attempted to make reservations on the same day and the only opening they had was at 9:00 pm.  we did a walk in to hopefully land a cancellation spot or two of the coveted five counter seats, and it was only a 30 minute wait for the counter seats!  sweet!  but yes, make reservations way in advance, especially if you have a larger party or it's a weekend.\n\nthe thing to look out for is the specials board.  they usually list about 5-6 items on there that range from raw to cooked items.  the weirdest part about this board is that it will change during your visit there.  during our 2-3 hour dinner, we saw some things sell out and get replaced with something else.  the waitstaff doesn't mention the newer items, so it's something you just have to look out for.  (for example, oysters were not listed on the specials board but the party sitting next to us ended up ordering the last giant oyster.  they were seated after us and only knew about it because the oyster was sitting on ice right in front of them!  they had squid on ice too, but it wasn't listed on the specials board!)  so, not only are you keeping your eyes out for the changing specials board but you have to see what's fresh and on ice that day!  we do get a few cooked items and although they are good, the raw fish choices are always the best!\n\nthese days we skip the robata grill items, not because they aren't tasty but we like to focus on the more unique items.  \n\none of our most favorite items is the <mark>Crispy Asparagus Okaki</mark> ($5).  it's a simple asparagus that's been dredged in rice crackers and deep-fried.  i don't know why it's so good but it just is.  and when you add a little of their matcha salt, oh my gawd!  i just love it.\n\nanother item we had on this last visit include the <mark>Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard</mark> ($10).  there's a piece of duck that lays on top of this dish, and it's actually duck liver they use, not goose.  the foie gras is already mixed in with the egg, so it gives the whole dish a rich egg taste.  \n\n<mark>Poached Egg</mark> with sea urchin and salmon roe ($9) is another unusual pairing, mostly because of the mountain yam that gives this dish a slimy texture.  you break up the egg and mix it all together, but you can't help but notice the slimy effect from the mountain yam.  it's a tasty nonetheless.  \n\nthe kobe beef liver sashimi ($9.50) is something that not everyone would enjoy.  the husband isn't usually a fan of liver, except served foie gras style, but he was game.  and it did still lend a livery taste, but it's something that you have to try once.\n\ni always enjoy homemade tofu and raku's tofu (whole $5.50) does not disappoint.  they server theirs with bonito shavings, ginger, and scallions.\n\nthe four condiments placed on every table should not go ignored, especially the green tea salt and their own soy sauce.  yum!\n\nsince they expanded, their bathrooms are indeed something to look at.  first off, it's so clean and pristine and holds one of the cleanest fish tanks you'll ever see on spring mountain! \n\nservice on our last few visits have been much better compared to my first visit.  the waitress that took care of us at the counter never let my water glass go empty and she was always letting us know when our food was coming so we weren't waiting too long and giving us clean plates too.\n\nmy only real gripe was this: although i usually love sitting at the counter so i can watch the chefs at work, i also can't overlook things that probably shouldn't be seen by dining guests.  one of the prep guys at the counter sneezed into his hands and continued prepping the food.  i was totally turned off by this, especially because there was a sink right behind him.  it wasn't too long after when the husband said to me that we weren't going to be ordering anymore cold foods.  when i inquired as to why, he said he noticed the same prep guy just cough into his hands and continue working.  yes, a sneeze and cough into the very bare hands that were prepping the food.  yuck.\n\nnonetheless, we still do love raku and would continue recommending it.  but alas, those basic hygiene issues need to be addressed!  \n\n4.5 stars.", 
            "simply amazing! one of the best restaurants i have ever eaten in. the <mark>Poached Egg</mark> with sea urchin and salmon roe, the <mark>Sashimi Salad</mark>, and the kobe beef and iberico pork are a must.", 
            "best japanese restaurant in vegas...well i've only tried this one but i am sure a lot of people will agree. we had the hamachi collar, kinki sashimi and grilled, foie gras on a skewer, <mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark>, foie gras and tofu, butter sauteed scallop with soys sauce, direct flamed eggplant, <mark>Poached Egg</mark> with sea urchin and salmon roe, and some kobe and pork skewers. it was a very memorable food experience and i have no problem suggesting this restaurant for it's high quality food and service. be sure to check it out if you are in vegas and want to eat more than just sushi rolls for japanese food.", 
            "each presentation of food transcended to pure art in both flavor and aesthetics. \n\nthis was one the finest evenings of food i have ever experienced. \n\ntotally unexpected - unbelievably enjoyable. \n\ni did not have one singular taste that was not transformative, but among my favorites: \n\n- <mark>Poached Egg</mark> with sea urchin and salmon roe\n- butter saut\\u00e9ed scallop with soy sauce\n- yellowtail with glazed soy-based sauce\n\nwhen it is my time to hang on the gallows - i will choose raku as my last meal.", 
            "two words - deliciously expensive.\n\nso our group walked in at 12:30 am on sunday without booking and we had to wait about 15 minutes to get seated. there was a 2 hours dining limit. \n\n<mark>Poached Egg</mark> with sea urchin and salmon roe ($9) - definitely not a dish everyone can accept because of the sea urchin's unique taste, but personally i thought the dish had an interesting texture (gooey and slimy) and a very subtle taste (a bit sweet and a bit salty). overall, a very neat dish.\n\nenoki mushroom w/ bacon ($3 each) - *munch munch munch* chewy and flavorful and it smelled delicious.  \n\nkurobuta pork cheek ($4.25 each) - best order of the night. so chewy, so tender, so juicy, and so mind-blowingly good. \n\n<mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark> (half, $7.5) - not my favorite dish, but it wasn't too bad. slightly fried homemade tofu with dashi broth = very refreshing taste.\n\napple marinated colorado lamb chop ($16) - my goodness, this gotta be the single biggest lamb chop i've ever seen. probably the 2nd best lamb chop i've had and one of the most succulent and smoky lamb chop ever. \n\nkobe beef tendon ($3.5 each) - crispy tendon with rich and fatty taste. i personally liked cheek a bit better, but tendon was really good too. \n\ndefinitely one of the best izakaya i've tried so far. this place is definitely a bit more expensive than your typical izakaya places, but you are essentially paying for quality and not quantity. if some people are willing to spend $50 for vegas buffets, then i don't see why price would be an issue here. after all - this is las vegas right =)?", 
            "located way off the strip in an unassuming shopping center, you'd probably miss this restaurant if you blinked. luckily, the stellar reviews made in part by my fellow yelpers piqued my interest in finding this elusive favorite. now locating the place is a challenge in itself but landing a reservation is equally exhausting!\nas fate would have it, i landed a 9pm dining reservation. woot! little did i know, however, that a reservation merely meant when you arrived, you'd be relegated to waiting an additional 10-15minutes for your seat. \nthat being said, i took the opportunity to park it at the sidebar to glance over the extensive menu while guzzling down a bottle of asahi with shots of chilled nigori. \nhonestly, by the time i was seated, i was about three sheets to the wind! i know, i'm a cheap date.\n\nnow onto the food shall we?\n\ni went with the server's recommendations as well as my seasoned yelp buddies' choices who've had successful dining experiences here previously...\n\nnegitoro blue fin 35$ fresh and buttery slices of blue fin tuna with a cast of delectable condiments that left my taste buds doing a happy dance! trust me, the experience is virtually umami x 10! \n\nwagyu sashimi 20$ - thinly sliced filets of premium rare wagyu beef with a hint of wasabi on top and accompanied with a special savory soy dipping sauce. the first bite was like velvet on my tongue and the mouthfeel was literally like butter melting in my mouth. superb!\n\n<mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark> 7.50$ 1/2 order -a delightful dish with compelling flavors and an irresistibly soft texture that had me pining for more \n\nbutter saut\\u00e9ed scallop 7$ x2 - my favorite dish of the evening. the butter poached scallops were soft and supple with an incredibly mouthwatering garlicky flavor and fluffy texture. absolutely amazing!\n\nenoki mushroom & bacon 3$ x2 come on now, we know everything tastes better with bacon and this was no exception. just order it and thank me later.\n\nchicken wrapped chicken skin 3x2 -tender chunks of chicken breast wrapped in succulent chicken skin. an indulgent  experience that is second to none \n\n<mark>Poached Egg</mark> with sea urchin & salmon roe full cast of delectable ingredients that left my taste buds in a tailspin of delight. intriguing enjoyable and texturally fascinating! \n\nother notable dishes included:\nkobe garlic skirt 7.50 x2\nkurobuta pork cheek 4.25$ x2\n<mark>Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard</mark> 10\nduck in balsamic 4.50$ x2\niberico pork 10 x2\nnigori 40$ well worth it! imo i bought 2 bottles :)\n\nall in all, i had a great dining experience at raku and it's safe to say i'd gladly return to enjoy their enticing small plates again and, of course, to imbibe in their spirits!\n\nhappy eats!",

            "my husband looks for any excuse to leave town, so we recently visited las vegas.  the main focus on our venture was to get away, relax, and seek some good eats.  we found raku on yelp and decided to make a reservation.  our reservation was made 2 weeks in advance while they were booked out, but were going to squeeze us in.  i highly recommend making reservations.  that night the hostess had to turn away several people. \n\ni did not go to raku with expectations because my husband picks the restaurant and i tag along.  the atmosphere was nice, but nothing out of the ordinary.  the service was prompt and attentive.  it was hard to choose from the menu because everything sounded so good.  we ended up ordering a lot.   everything was very good, but a few things were more memorable then others.  the dishes that stood out most were the garlic skirt steak, the house made tofu, the apple marinated lamb chop, the foie steamed egg duck broth with udon, and the green tea soba with <mark>Poached Egg</mark>.  the flavors and preparation for these items were fantastic.  i personally appreciated the tofu and the soba noodles most because they taste like they were skillfully made from scratch.  the tofu had so much depth and richness.  they provide you with green tea salt and some house made soy sauce to sprinkle or dip the tofu in.  it was so simple yet flavorful.  a part of me wanted to order  tofu to go and pour some honey over it.  i imagine it would also make a good dessert tofu.  the soba had a very nice texture and the green tea flavor worked well.  i think it is one of the best soba noodles i've had outside of japan.  \n\nwe were both very satisfied with our experience for it felt as if we were eating food in japan. we will definitely return in the future.", 
            "i'm from the midwest area, which authentic japanese dining is very limited. everytime i visit vegas ( at least twice per year), i would make a reservation for raku. the restaurant is limited in space and highly rcmd reservation (they usually seat reservation in one of the private booth/room). rcmd checking out the bathroom which has a fish tank and heated toilet.  i've been to raku for few times and these reviews are based on all the items i've tried. sometimes, there may be a language barrier and was difficult to understand the type of fish or entree for the daily special. \n\nskewers: the price on the menu is for one skewer. skewers are cooked over a special type of charcoal from japan, therefore you would really taste a bbq/charcoal flavor in the meat.\n\nkobe tendon - rcmd sharing this skewer with others. the tendon which is good fat, would melt like butter in your mouth. don't consume too much of it because it very heavy in taste. i would just take a bite of it for sampling. \n\nkobe beef filet with wasabi - $12 a skewer for kobe filet which was a thick cut. it was good, but it was okay. maybe it was too well done, i prefer medium rare. personally, i think the kobe skirt which was thinly sliced tasted better.\n\nkobe beef outside skirt $8- one of my favorite skewer, the beef was tender and tad of charcoal taste to it. not too overdone and just right. \n\nbeef tongue - delicious and it's a bit crispy and bouncy to the taste, \n\nkurobuta pork cheek - very tasty. love it.\n\nchicken - i always order the wrong chicken or  different chicken skewer but it's all tender and juicy,\n\nyellowtail $7 - good deal for a tasty filet of yellowtail with glazed sweet sauce over it. it was flaming delicious. \n\neggplant - direct flamed eggplant that was covered with bonito flake. it was not spectacular, but average.\n\nregular food item:\nraku tofu - home made tofu that is nicely presented. i usually sprinkle with the matcha sea salt and bit of the house soy sauce. my usual appetizer that i order every time.\n\nudon with <mark>Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard</mark> soup - the udon is served cold in a basket and i think it's homemade because it's not the typical thick udon. the foie gras is infused in the <mark>Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard</mark>. you dip the cold udon into the warm <mark>Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard</mark> soup. sooo hearty... unfortunately, i flll up on the skewer and never have room for the udon.\n\n<mark>Poached Egg</mark> with sea urchin and salmon roe - pretty much everything mixed together in a small bowl. it's all raw and raw. the taste was okay and fresh, but not amazing. the texture was slimy been there, done that.. ill try something else next time\n\n<mark>Juicy Deep Fried Chicken</mark> - <mark>Juicy Deep Fried Chicken</mark> and the chicken was juicy and tender. \n\ngrilled rice ball -  a ball of rice that is fried on the outside. cool concept, but i'll skip it and save room for the skewers.\n\ndaily chef's special:\nrock fish - the whole fish was served in chunks of sashimi which was sweet and extremely fresh. my friend and i finished the whole fish. soy sauce and wasabi is not needed, just chew it raw!!!  it's very reasonable for $45. later, the bones of the fish was fried and served. this is one of my favorite fish.\n\nwagyu beef sukiyaki - do you know how difficult to find a restaurant that serves sukiyaki the right way? most place would just dump the meat and the vegetable in a bowl and serve it.  raku does it just like how it's done in tokyo! the vegetable are cooking over a pot of charcoal claypot and the raw meat is placed atop and simmers to your liking. the waiter would crack a raw egg in a bowl and it's used for dipping for the meat. love it and i wish there was more meat to it.\n\noverall, one of my favorite robata grill. after the meal, it's pretty heavy and you might to drink some alcohol with your meal. the plaza that this restaurant is located is a foodie paradise. in this plaza, there is sweets raku, monta ramen, kung fu tea, snowflake shavery ice, kabuto, japanese curry, and japanese italian noodle (not sure of the name).", 
            "they really live up to the hype. even though they were busy the service was still really good and the servers were very attentive.  now on to the food. \nwe had the yellowtail belly, soba with <mark>Poached Egg</mark>, kobe beef skewers and the pork belly. \nfirst the yellowtail was so good. it was cut into pieces with a crunchy, salty skin and no bone making it so easy an delicious to eat. \nthe soba with <mark>Poached Egg</mark> was good too. i just love egg with anything so the fact that it comes with a perfectly poached one just makes it that much better. the kobe beef skewers were so so tender just as you would expect. but now the killer was their pork belly. i believe it's kurobuta pork belly. that might not be spelled right but close enough for you to find it on the menu. you need to get this. it is absolutely the best pork belly i have ever had. it just melts right when it hits your mouth. it's perfect with a bite of rice. i could just come order three of these and be happy. we also got the creme br\\u00fbl\\u00e9e which was pretty good. not like the best i've ever had but definitely good. all in all worth every hype, wait, and penny.", 
            "a definite must-return! \n\nreservations are highly recommended. my friend and i dined in on a weekday and the place was packed. the two of us were overly ecstatic and over-ordered upon being seated: \n\nwe ordered three items off the appetizer section. raku's tofu is homemade as is the soy sauce. it is a delicacy that should not be skipped. the <mark>Poached Egg</mark> with sea urchin and salmon roe were very fresh, but i was not a fan of the slimy texture. \nthe butter sauteed scallop with soy sauce arrived on half of a clam shell. it was perfectly glazed and seared. \n\nas for the robata grill, we ordered various skewers. the chicken thigh was not what i wanted but nonetheless, the meat was tender and succulent. the yellowtail glazed with soy-based sauce was done in medium. for $7, it is well worth it and can be shared among two people. the kurobuta pork intestine was exceptionally soft and without a slight sense of gaminess. the kurobuta pork cheek arrived with a shimmer resembling fatty meat. but the texture was crisp and the flavors were perfect. i would definitely order this one again.\n\nit does not end there. we also ordered the kobe beef outside skirt with garlic and kobe beef tendon. i am not a big fan of garlic, but i made the exception without regret. if you're feeling in need of collagen, get a skewer of tendon all to yourself. if you are not particularly fond of the soft, gelatin, melt-in-your-mouth texture, share it with somebody!\n\nlast but not least, we ended our meal with the udon with foie gras and <mark>Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard</mark> soup. unlike most thick-cut udon noodles, this one resembles angel hair. the udon is served separately in a tiny basket with a generous piece of foie gras floating atop the bowl of warm broth. i was pretty full from the items above but this was not something to turn away from. \n\nthe damage was done at approximately $50 per person.", 
            "this is one of the best meals i've had in a while. the quality of the food is quite remarkable. it's off the beaten path in a non pretentious environment, making it a truly spectacular hidden gem.\n\nthe small menu comprises a handful of small cold and hot dishes along with some grilled items. very small for an izakaya, but there is good reason.  the focus is more on the quality of the ingredients used, which \n\nto start, i had the house made tofu and <mark>Poached Egg</mark> with ikura and uni.  the tofu was  purely transcendent.  it's creamy, dense, and when paired with their house brewed soy sauce, out of this world.  the three way of eggs was really interesting.  our waiter was kind enough to show us how to eat these dishes.\n\nin addition to the regular menu, they also had a selection of sashimi.  when we ordered the japanese amberjack, we had pieces from the belly and the loin, showing the different tastes and textures of the fish.\n\nthe highlight of the night was the <mark>Juicy Deep Fried Chicken</mark>.  the chicken was so succulent that i nearly cried. there was also some spinach salad on the bottom to balance out the richness.\n\nthere are very few meals that have rocked my socks off and this is one of them.",

            "so glad i got to try this place!\n\nwhat i ate:\n- raku's tofu: honestly, this was my favorite dish of the night. it was so simple, but soooo tasty, especially when paired with the various condiments found on the table - the aged soy sauce, the sea salt, etc. the tofu was so fresh. the texture was like a firm custard or a panna cotta. i wanted to order another one just for myself. \n- <mark>Poached Egg</mark> with sea urchin and salmon roe: so, i loved this dish soooo much, but it wasnt perfect for me. i mean, i love everything in this dish. even the mountain yam, with it's ooey gooey texture was nice in this dish. but for me, this would have been perfect over a nice bowl of fresh white rice, with just a drizzle of the aged soy sauce. that would have been my perfect dish. it was still great to eat though. it was ooey from the mountain yam (if you havent had it before it has that slimy texture, similar to okra, but it crunchy like an apple), the bursts of sea salt freshness from the uni, the salty umami pops from the salmon roe, the creaminess from the <mark>Poached Egg</mark>. it was really delicious, but i would love this over a bowl of white rice. \n- <mark>Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard</mark>: this was probably the other contender for my favorite dish of the night. the <mark>Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard</mark> was sooooo ... omg, let me wipe the drool from my face. it was so creamy and silken and salty and full of umami flavor from the foie gras. the little piece of foie on the top was tender. it came in a tiny little bowl, and i wanted more, so much more. \n- (special) grilled langostine: yes. this was tasty. sweet and tender, and a bit smokey from the grill. \n- kobe beef filet w/wasabi: i loved the fresh wasabi. it complimented the tender beef so well\n- kobe beef outside skirt w/garlic: do you love garlic? do you love beef? then you should get this skewer. the fried garlic was a tasty little garlic chip, the beef tender\n- kobe beef liver: i was not a fan, but i'm not a fan of liver in general. i'm not that cultured i suppose. it was just a bit too gritty and irony for me, but my two dining buddies loved it. more for them!\n- butter sauteed sea scallop with soy sauce: this was absolutely decadent! the scallop was perfectly cooked, but it was the soy sauce butter that made this sooo tasty. it was almost too salty, but i didnt care. wanted to eat them all \n- mushroom w/bacon: cooked to perfection\n\npros:\n- food: i really wanted to try everything on this menu! i definitely want to come back and get the omakase tasting menu\n- service was spot on, typical of a japanese restaurant\n- quality of the food was exquisite\n- decor: i really liked how this place was decorated. it was dark and intimate, the tables were of wood. it was nice. \n\ncons:\n- small. tiny. seriously, very small restaurant. two small dining rooms, one counter where you could sit in front of the cooks. this isnt the place to bring your six other friends. best to bring a date or just a few other friends\n- reservations are hard to come by. actually, no it wasnt hard, but when we made reservations a month in advance, the first time that was available was 1030 at night. i found it amusing that a family was there around that same time asking for a table, and being turned away, next the next available seating time was at 130am. so my advice make a rez! \n- pricey. yes. but... not pricey. admittedly this was our second dinner of the night (fatty status oink oink!), but i thought for the quality of the food we got, and the thoughtfulness in which the food was prepared, the price point was just right. though i've never had it, i would think that the omakase tasting menu would be the best bang for your buck!\n\nwould i come again? yes! already planning my next meal here",

            "another visit to raku and had another stellar experience at the kitchen bar.  one thing that i tried to do different this time was to order things i've haven't had before.  even though i've been to raku five times already, there were still plenty more things on and off their menu that i've yet to try.\n\non to the food.  so pretty much everything except for the last two items were all new dishes for me.\n\nmushoom salad complimentary appetizer -- http://bit.ly/1bcj0l6\nthis was their amuse-bouche for the day.  i love mushrooms so this was a very good way to start off my dinner.\n\n<mark>Poached Egg</mark> with sea urchin and salmon roe -- http://bit.ly/1gyp7jq\nnot only was this appetizer photogenic, it was really good!  of course anything with a runny egg is good in my book.  and the uni and roe combo was creamy and surprisingly not too salty.  i'd would definitely order this again!\n\nbraised abalone special with dashi gravy -- http://bit.ly/1ex5nsv\nthis was off of their specials board.  and i'm glad i ordered it.  i have never had abalone before so this was a new experience for me.  the abalone was grilled, sliced up, and smothered with gravy.  i was thinking that it was going to have a very strong fishy taste, but that wasn't the case.  it was almost like eating a lobster or monkfish where it had a chewy texture and it would take a long time to chew out the flavor which had a lot of umami thanks to the dashi gravy.  delicious!\n\ngrilled langoustine -- http://bit.ly/1gxvpda\nas i was eating my appetizer, i was peering over to their seafood table behind the bar and saw these amazing looking langoustines.  i had to have one so immediately ordered it.  it was good!  the langoustine was grilled to perfection where it was easily removable from the shell and the meat was very tender and flavorful.  it was worth the impulsive splurge.\n\nduck with balsamic soy sauce -- http://bit.ly/1i4mpol\ni ordered this last time i here and it was still just as good.  the duck was grilled nicely and had a very rich flavor with the balsamic soy sauce.\n\ngrilled foie gras with black garlic and glazed soy-based sauce -- http://bit.ly/1ncae7d\nwhat better way to finish my meal off than with a stick of their famous grilled foie gras.  it actually has been a while since i last ordered this so i figured it was worth another go around.  they really don't hold back with the portion size as you can see from the pic.  it's a very generous sized piece of foie gras.  and it was so good.  i love how they include a piece of black garlic to give it a more intense flavor.  i'll be alternating between this and their <mark>Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard</mark> from now on.  as much as i'd like to have both as the same time, it'd be better for me to keep them separate since they're equally rich and exquisite.\n\nraku does it again for me with their great service and impressive dishes.  i'm so happy to see that business is still doing well for them.  reservations are still hard to get here as i found that out from another customer that she made her reservation almost a month in advance.  hopefully with their recently announced expansion, it'll be much easier to get a reservation and should provide more tables for walk-ins as well.  there's still plenty more for me to try at raku, so expect another review from me in the near future.",

            "love it. definite must-go when you're vegas! i can see why other chefs come here to dine -- the dishes are well balanced, flavorful and in small portions (izakaya/robata of course), so you can order many to try!\n\nwe went here to celebrate the bf's birthday; i made reservations about a month in advance (via phone only). reservations is recommended as the place is small/intimate, and i believe max seating would be for a party of 5-6. \n\ni love their house-made salt, chili, and sauces. they were all delicious! and even though its not needed on any of their dishes, it subtly elevates each bite. the description on the tray is also a very nice touch.\n\nservice is wonderful. i don't think you can go wrong with any dish you order - lamb chop, kobe beef, anything with foie gras, crispy asparagus, etc... yum!\n\np.s. they were out of the sea urchin and <mark>Poached Egg</mark> dish when we were there, the only disappointment of the evening. just gives me even more of a reason to go back :)\n\nohh! and save room for dessert. raku sweets is in the same shopping complex and almost just as wonderful.", 
            "4.5 stars\n\nduring my last trip to vegas in january, i wanted to try raku, but i couldn't get a same day reservation. this last trip, i made sure to call ahead and reserve a spot. we had dinner here on thursday, july 9th at 10pm. we were a party of 5 and shared everything.\n\nwe all got hot tea: hoji cha tea ($2.50ea) and a bottle of sake to share: shichihonyari \"seven spears men\", junmai nama genshu, prefecture: shiga ($80 bottle). description of sake from menu: \"this is a very drinkable but complex limited released unpasteurized sake has the prototypical sake brewery aroma that is like a wet collection of steamed rice, green grasses, yeast and green apples. a nama that actually tastes like rice, which is a rarity these days.\" i don't know much about sake, but this was dry enough for me to drink. and i was sold when they said limited release!\n\nspecials:\n*wagyu sashimi ($20)\n*bluefin / negitoro ($31)\n*king crab ($20)\n\ni loved the wagyu and sashimi! these were my favorites out of the specials. the wagyu melted in my mouth and the sashimi was super fresh. i'd skip the king crab next time as it was just a grilled leg. it was good, but nothing special.\n\ncold dish:\n*kobe beef liver sashimi ($9.50)\n*<mark>Yellowtail Carpaccio</mark> ($12)\n*<mark>Poached Egg</mark> with sea urchin and salmon roe ($9) x2\n\n<mark>Yellowtail Carpaccio</mark> is a must! so tender. the uni dish is super rich. i enjoyed the first bite, but it needed something to cut through the richness as i continued eating it. i wasn't a fan of the liver sashimi as raw liver isn't really appealing to me.\n\nhot dish:\n*<mark>Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard</mark> ($10) x2\n*agedashi fish belly: hamachi belly ($18), agadashi belly (+$5)\n\ni was in heaven with the steam <mark>Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard</mark>. omg! the silky custard with the delicately seared foie?! sooo good! all flavors i adore. the agedashi fish belly was okay. i thought it wasn't crispy enough and a little mushy. though i'm not sure if we waited too long to eat it. sake will do that to you!\n\nrobata grill:\n*kobe beef outside skirt with garlic ($7.50) x3\n*kurobuta pork cheek ($4.25) x3\n*duck with balsamic soy sauce ($4.50) x3\n*foie gras with glazed soy-based sauce ($17.50) x3\n\nfor 5 people, 3 skewers per order were perfect. we were here to try a bunch of dishes, so half a skewer allowed for a bite or two of each item. i'm a foie addict, so of course i loved the foie! seared to perfection. i also loved the pork cheek. super tender. i also enjoyed the beef and duck. i honestly don't think you can go wrong with any of the skewers they offered. all had a nice smoky flavor and were delicious!\n\nrice/noodle/soup:\n*cold green tea soba with <mark>Poached Egg</mark> ($8.50)\n\nthis was my least favorite dish. i don't really enjoy cold noodles, so i didn't find this appetizing at all. i think cold noodles are supposed to be refreshing, but i just don't get it. i've enjoyed korean cold noodles from time to time, but they have a nice vinegar and spicy flavor. this didn't have that.\n\nyay, i finally tried raku! did it live up to the hype?! definitely with certain dishes! i adored all the foie, carpaccio, sashimi and skewers. some missed the mark for me, but i think it was more about taste preference than anything else. i'm a little sad we didn't try any of their tofu as i believe that is one of their specialties. next time raku, next time!", 
            "raku is the place to go to if you want to try something different. it's really all about \"quality over quantity\". the only reason why i gave 4 stars and not 5 was because our <mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark> didn't come out until towards the end even though it's an \"appetizer\". also, i made the mistake of ordering the <mark>Poached Egg</mark> with uni and salmon roe, it just wasn't for me. although, make sure to order the <mark>Juicy Deep Fried Chicken</mark>! honestly, the best piece of chicken i've ever eaten lol. the <mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark> is a must and so is the kobe beef with wasabi. best dish of the night was the alaskan king crab, the freshest and sweetest crab meat i've ever tasted (it was one of their specialty dishes for that night). shout out to my sister for treating us to dinner. she real af for that.", 
            "rsvpd a few days in advance for dinner at 6:30 on a thursday. we didn't need to wait once we arrived, and luckily got seated towards the quieter back. \n\nwhat we got:\n\n<mark>Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard</mark>- love steamed scrambled egg, chinese people eat it with cooking wine, but their foie gras infusion was killer. great texture too. the only thing i don't like about foie gras, well one of the things, is the livery aftertaste. the custard still had that aftertaste. \n\nfoie gras skewer- for $17 it didn't disappoint. literally melt in your mouth! could've been enough for four i think, but our foie gras aficionado finished it off for us. \n\ngreen tea cold noodle - nice, simple dish that contrasted with the rich, flavorful dishes we ordered afterward. i don't know what the process is for serving cold dishes first, but i would've appreciated this cold noodle more after eating the foie gras. light dish in contrast to the heavy richness of the foie gras. \n\nscallop - served in a hot shell. i didn't think it was amazing. \n\nsea urchin with salmon roe- i'm not a uni fan, but this combo with the <mark>Poached Egg</mark> was awesome. sweet, light, gooey, & interesting textures (bubble like roe & mushrooms held together by the gooey egg yolk). like how the yolk balanced out the uni. \n\n<mark>Sashimi Salad</mark> - that was delicious. i loved the sashimi with the miso dressing. refreshing way to whet our appetites. \n\nraku tofu- you can dress it two ways, and i preferred the chives + soy sauce way. the more i ate it the hungrier i got - so as an appetizer it did its job (making us hungrier and ready for the heartier meat dishes). \n\niberian pork skewers - a special at $10/skewer. i thought it was a tad undercooked, but the meat was definitely tender and fatty. not a huge fan though and prob won't order it again. \n\nwaygu beef sashimi - aka raw beef. after eating this i realized i like my beef cooked medium rare. the beef was tender, but really chewy due to the fat on it. like people in my party were having trouble eating it it was so chewy. at $20 a plate, i'd skip this at the next go round. \n\n<mark>Juicy Deep Fried Chicken</mark>: dark chicken meat cooked like a pot roast, but with a thin crispy skin (like roast duck skin except with chicken). chicken was underdone. truth be told, we only ordered it bc the table next to us ordered it and i'm a fattie that loves me some <mark>Juicy Deep Fried Chicken</mark>. \n\noverall: i generally thought everything needed some salt (not the green tea salt on the table), and most of the red meats and \"other white meats\" could've been cooked slightly more. \n\nservice was very polite, though slightly over attentive. i'm not used to someone constantly coming by your table, switching out your plates after every two dishes, etc. \n\nand it's a very clean restaurant! i read in a cooking book (kitchen confidential) that you can tell how clean a kitchen is by how clean the bathrooms are. the bathroom here was very clean, very japanese (ie super high tech toilets that required actual reading to operate) with an aquarium! i guess they were trying to make us feel like we were in an aquarium too with the blue walls & tile (i'm analyzing this bathroom waaaay too much...).", 
            "a tapas place for us big kids. an extensive menu is offered as well as a daily specials board. the service is a bit slow but the informative and attentive staff makes up for it.\n\nthe restaurant itself is low lit in the second room. if you want it to be a silver bit more bright, request the bar or table seating in the front. \n\neach table comes with information cards explaining the homemade soy sauce and salts.  i was a bit bummed that the one on my table was missing that evening but that's forgivable since i was easily able to grab the empty table's set to read. \n\ni really appreciate the bowls/ plates/spoons change with each dish that comes out. you can tell they take great pleasure in the details of the craftsmanship and  process of each dish.  \n\nwhat was ordered:\n\n<mark>Poached Egg</mark> with sea urchin and salmon roe - i need two orders of this. one egg is not meant for sharing! yum yum!\nchicken breast wrapped with chicken skin - not bad, the chicken meat was a bit dry. i would probably leave room for other items to try on my next visit\nkobe beef outside skirt with garlic - can't go wrong with tender beef and garlic\nkurobuta pork cheek - tasty. it has a nice texture to the bite\n<mark>Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard</mark> - order it! make sure one per person if you are a foie fan. the custard is silky and the foie is melted into the broth \nkobe beef silver skin - not too memorable - i would skip \nfoie gras don- unlike the custard version, this one is a whole slice of the lobe and it's perfect to savor \ngrilled rice ball in broth(add toppings: salmon for the broth) - the layer of rice, ikura and fish is to my liking and they make just right. note- might be considered bland to some\nraku's tofu - offered in two sizes and freshly prepared. they are known for the silky freshness of the tofu and the seasoned condiments that you sprinkle on each bite.  my dining parter did not appreciate it as much as i did. i think if you love tofu, it's worth a try. and yes, truly an experience.\n\nall i know now is that i must hurry on back!\n\n\nwhat you need to know: \n\n-- rsvp is recommended.  in fact, i insist that you do make one as people start queuing up 30 minutes before the restaurant even opens\n-- bar seating is the only area not reserved. first come first serve for bar seating. if you arrive at opening with reservations, you'll have a good chance scoring a seat \n-- they are open until 3am\n-- restaurant has two sections and one bar area \n-- definitely consider the daily specials board\n-- just steps over from sweets raku. (so leave room if you are a dessert lover like myself)\n-- parking is ample in a plaza", 
            "unexpectedly impressed!  will come back tomorrow in a heartbeat! service and food were outstanding, and the price, unbelievable!\n\nstarted with raku tofu, housemade and as silken as they can come, with bonito flakes, scallions and garlic on the side (a must)! we also had wagyu beef sashimi (loved it), kobe beef liver sashimi (hub's favorite), <mark>Poached Egg</mark>, uni and salmon roe (omg!), <mark>Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard</mark> (foie gras in every bite), ikura don (went well with everything), <mark>Juicy Deep Fried Chicken</mark> (oh so tender, juicy and tasty), pork cheeks (flavorful), pig ears (crunchy) and kobe beef tendons (my dessert!). where can you find all these delectable dishes??? not in sf!!  \n\ni like how the waitress let us know in what order the food should be eaten (cuz we kept asking for the ikura bowl and the <mark>Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard</mark> that they held back), from tofu, salad, cold dishes, grilled items to rice bowls.   and which of the special sauce and seasonings to use that is available on each table.\n\nordered a bottle of domaine du chalet pouilly fuisse to wash all that yumminess down!  our first meal of a 7-day stay....boy, it's gonna be hard to beat!", 
            "this place has an art of combining different flavors and bringing it all together in a dish. every dish was memorable and delicious! i ate here for the first time a month ago and still remember all the dishes! lol.  it seems a base for a majority of the dishes was miso but it was very very subtle.  we started off with their house made tofu which was just delicious! i could eat the tofu just by itself. perfect firmness and texture. it's a flavor taste palette where you go one by one, adding the ginger first-taste, seaweed&ginger next-taste, and then seaweed&ginger&soy sauce-taste.  a definite must try!  next we went with a cold dish, the <mark>Poached Egg</mark> with sea urchin and salmon roe.  the dish was absolutely delicious and all kinds of taste buds on my tongue! sea urchin doesn't overpower the dish at all and adds character to the plate.  the foie gras with glazed soy-based sauce was very yummy. it was very fatty and rich, melt in your mouth, fall apart on the touch.  finishing off with cold green tea soba with <mark>Poached Egg</mark> cold noodles really hit the spot.  it's a very very light dish and the <mark>Poached Egg</mark> adds richness to the dish.  we topped our dinner off with a bottle of yoshinogawa echigo junkai sake and of course sapparo. the sake itself is not too overpowering and is considerably light/crisp.  the body itself goes down smoothly.", 
            "delicious! we were visiting vegas from new jersey and this was our favorite meal, and the cheapest. i had called two days prior for reservations but they were fully booked. they did say that we could try coming in right at opening to see if they could accommodate us. we had a flight to catch that night but chanced it anyway - showed up 10 minutes before opening where there was already a small line about 8 people deep. we luckily got a table. amongst the 4 of us - one had shellfish allergies, another did not eat sushi/anything raw. they were very cautious and reassuring about the shellfish allergy and tailored his meal accordingly. and there were a bunch of options on the menu for my friend who doesn't eat raw food. the two guys got the premium omakase ($100) while we girls ordered a la carte. we all thoroughly enjoyed our meal. my favorite dishes were the <mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark>, <mark>Poached Egg</mark> with sea urchin and salmon roe, the kobe strip, and the foie gras bowl. they make their own raku \"salt\" which you can buy - but unfortunately we forgot. i think i may call them and see if i can have them ship it. we will definitely be back.", 
            "small and dainty place. reservations are highly recommended. food here was amazing. we ordered the raku tofu to start, and it did not disappoint. we also ordered the <mark>Poached Egg</mark> with uni, which i thought was just okay... for the skewers, we ordered filet with wasabi, filet with garlic, bacon wrapped enoki, balsamic duck, and seared scallops. everything was cooked to perfection! the scallops especially, were seasoned and cooked really well. the sauce to the bacon wrapped enoki was delicious! i couldn't get enough of it. for dessert, we had the fluffy cheesecake. yum! can't wait to be back.", 
            "i visited the place based on review here. the foie gras bowl was very good and so was the <mark>Poached Egg</mark> with uni and ikura.\nas a visitor to the city, it was nice as the atmosphere was different than the strip. there is a shaved ice place in the same mall, which is a good dessert to chase the good food here.", 
            "i love this place. \n\nit's so good. we came by right when they opened for dinner, since we didn't have reservations and they were accommodating (or we totally lucked out). the place is really small, so reservations are recommended. \n\nthey have three rotating board specials so you might see different specials being presented to different tables. if you ask, they will bring the other ones around to show you. \n\nwe went a little nuts with our ordering, but mostly everything was amazing. \n\nraku's tofu: \n- wasn't expecting to fall in love with this, i mean it's just tofu right? wrong. it was really good with the different seasoning options. it's tofu, but it's different. worth trying out if you come here since it's made in house. \n\n<mark>Yellowtail Carpaccio</mark>: \nmust get. it was just fresh and simple and delicious. \n\nbuttered scallop: \nthis was so good. the flavors were amazing and complemented the scallop. that butter sauce was so good, i wish i had something to sop it up. actually, my friend loved it so much she picked up the shell to drink the sauce. \n\n<mark>Poached Egg</mark> with sea urchin and salmon roe: \nit's a really rice dish, but it's amazing. we shared this, but i could have easily eaten this on my own. i thought it was going to be a little too fishy but everything was fresh and the flavors melded well together. \n\n<mark>Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard</mark>: \nso good. rich, but so good. we shared this as well, but easily could have eaten our own. the flavors of the fois gras came through but wasn't too heavy, probably balanced by the egg. \n\nagedashi kama: \namazing. the fish was piping hot and moist. i thought i had tried a really good hamachi kama at another restaurant in sf, but this one tops it for sure. it was just really flavorful and delicious. \n\nkobe beef outside skirt with garlic:\namazing. the beef was tender and perfectly cooked. the flavors were on point. \n\nkobe beef tendon: \nthis was a little different from what i expected. i'm used to tendon in soups, so i don't eat dry tendon often, but it was delicious nonetheless. \n\nkurobuta pork cheek: \ndelicious. the flavor was slight and smoky. some places overcook it and make it chewy but this was perfect. \n\nbluefin sashimi:\nprepared three different ways, fresh, grilled, wrapped in sushi. all three ways were delicious, mainly because the fish was so fresh. you can really taste the freshness. \n\nbeef waygu sashimi: \nsounded amazing, but it was a disappointment. the meat was really chewy and it wasn't as good as the kobe outside skirt with garlic we ordered. \n\nfluffy cheesecake: \nwe were intrigued by the description. we even poked at it when it came to the table, but the description of a \"mousse cheesecake\" is fitting. it's just really good. i'd order this again. it didn't feel heavy at all. \n\nwe also ordered a different sashimi option but it wasn't nearly as good as the bluefin. i think our two disappointing items were the beef waygu sashimi and the other fish sashimi option. \n\ni'll definitely come back here. it was a pricey but delicious dinner. worth every penny.", 
            "omg food is intricately prepared and to die for! every bite had so much flavor and there was not a single item that my group did not like. be prepared to spend $$$ if you want a filling meal though. \n\nhighly recommend the beef tongue, pork cheek, and enoki bacon skewers. uni with <mark>Poached Egg</mark> was also stellar.  will be back to try more of the menu!\n\ncall between the hours of 2:30-4:30 to make a reservation. reservations are a must!"

            "wow...what a place.  it's tiny, interesting looking interior-wise with chocolate walls and low lighting that make everyone look good.  walls are lined with banquettes -- and tables in the middle can be pushed together for large groups -- but remember, this place is tiny, and the tables don't turn quickly at all.  we were there for two and a half hours and only 1 table left.  the only \"leaving\" is when folks head outside to smoke.\n\nwhat i loved was that my husband had taken a group here a few weeks ago (brett below) was with him...and they had a monumental meal that made him feel guilty he'd not taken me first so we went last night and i thought it was spectacular with one lapse in service and food to knock one star off 5, but it was still dynamite.  \n\nthey were out of unfiltered sake which made him pout, but our server made an excellent recommendation on a bottle that we loved -- only problem was it went down too easily, and since they were low, wouldn't sell us a second...mid meal....\n\nstarted with skewered cherry tomatoes -- lightly salted that were still amazingly cool in the center.  we both could have eaten a pound of these.  we had a japanese version of caprese salad that blew my mind <mark>Sunomono - Cucumber And Seaweed</mark> for basil, sliced tomatoes, the creamiest tofu ever for mozzarella and for interest on top - and to take it so over the top that i was in awe -- teeny tiny baby eels that were fried to crispy sprinkled lightly on top.  he sprinkled green tea salt on the top and i was blown away.  \n\nthe <mark>Sashimi Salad</mark> with tuna and salmon, spinach and dressing of soy, yuzu and crispy shallots was to die for on such a hot night.\n\nthen we had fried octopus -- wow.  flavors that exploded in your mouth -- really satisfying and so simple.\n\nwhole <mark>Crispy Fried Shrimp</mark> were great and made for great comedy at the table -- a la bean on vacance in france a la gare...  if you saw the movie, you'll get the reference since you eat these whole -- we liked them much more than bean did. \n\nthis was where things fell apart -- where we'd had food coming out -- small plates -- timed perfectly...suddenly the brakes hit hard and the whole restaurant came to a standstill.  i jokingly said mused that the chef left to buy cigarettes...because seriously nothing came out of the kitchen for about 30 minutes.  \n\nthen magically, things slowly began to fire again...next we had foie gras skewers, terrific baby lamb chops and some raku seaweed and turnips, then some lovely chicken thighs, then a special dashi broth with snapper, shitake mushrooms, japanese eggplant and a lovely okra...then out came two of my favorites -- a chawanmushi with duck and foie gras and dashi broth -- yowza...absolutely mind blowing.  the flavor combination was amazing -- the smokey duck, the sweetness of the dashi, the creaminess of the cusard, the richness of the foie...just terrific...then skewers  of shishito peppers  -- if you've never had these and you like green chilis these rock.   \n\nthen we had one final dish that interestingly was my least favorite -- ground chicken on chopsticks that looked like corndogs but had oddly very little flavor...  or maybe i'd hit the wall...either way, we were officially maxed out -- the bill -- huge -- $240 before tip -- but that was with $100 in sake alone -- and the plates while numerous, were very very tiny...\n\nbut we loved it and i highly recommend checking it out... in true izakaya fashion this place is open late.  go with friends to taste and try everything -- order pitchers of beer, sake, have fun.  it's a great addition to town.", 
            "raku has been getting quite a buzz from the las vegas community, especially because it's one of those off-the-strip type places meant just for locals.  it's a japanese restaurant that specializes more in yakitori and street food.  (as other have mentioned, they do offer some sashimi, but that's not why you come here.)\n\nwith a party of four, we got to try a bunch of different things:\n\n* raku's tofu ($4) - highly recommended by our waiter since he said they are the only one in vegas that makes their own.  it's uniquely presented as a homemade tofu and comes with sides of grated ginger, scallions, and bonito shavings.  the texture and taste can be a bit surprising at first as it's definitely not your commercial tofu. but once you add a bit of the sides, and a little soy, it tastes pretty good actually.\n\n* sea urchin <mark>Sunomono - Cucumber And Seaweed</mark> with soup ($4) - presented in an individual bowl, two coils of uni rest on a bed of seaweed in a light broth.  the uni was good, and a bit different because of the warmth of the broth.  i enjoyed this dish and would get it again.\n\n* daikon radish and soft fish cake oden ($1.50/pp) - their oden menu consists of ordering individual pieces and they are all placed together as they have been stewing.  the daikon was less than memorable, something i wouldn't have ordered on my own nor again.  the fish cake was good though, although not something i particularly crave.  the side of hot wasabi mustard adds some much needed heat and taste to this dish.  definitely use it.\n\n* kobe beef fillet with wasabi ($9/pp) - expensive, but good.  depending on how the wasabi hits your mouth, it can be a shot up your nose or an enjoyable piece of meat.\n\n* kobe beef outside skirt with garlic ($6) - the crispy slices of fried garlic is what makes this beef really good.  i think it's actually tastier than the kobe beef fillet with wasabi.\n\n* chicken breast wrapped with chicken skin ($2.50/pp) - chicken breast is always boring to me, but what makes this enjoyable would probably be the fatty chicken skin.  the big f enjoyed this, but it's not something i would order again.\n\n* chicken wing ($1.50) - i personally didn't get a taste, but the guys in my party enjoyed it.\n\n* grilled duck with balsamic soy sauce ($4) - the duck was very tasty and had a nice sauce to it.  cooked well and enjoyable.\n\n* mushroom wrapped with bacon ($2/pp) - mushroom and bacon, need i say more? good stuff.\n\n* kurobuta pork cheeks ($2.50) - this is really good stuff, really fatty bad for you stuff i'm sure, but really good!  eat it when it's hot!\n\n* enoki mushroom wrapped in bacon ($2.50) - the enoki adds a slightly different taste and texture that makes it really enjoyable to eat.  both the bottom and top of the mushroom are texturally different as well.\n\n* ground chicken portabella ($3.50) - grilled portabellas are always good, add some chicken and seasonings and you can't go wrong.\n \n* lamb chop ($5) - the waiter claimed their lamb chops were fabulous and had people returning just for them. and i do admit, they were really good.  nicely cooked to a medium rare and juicy!\n\n* grilled rice ball ($5 for two) - the soy sauce grilled rice ball is tastier than the rice ball wrapped in the green leaf, so we ordered just this one.  \n\nwe tried ordering the potato with corn ($2.50), but they just ran out, same for the foie gras ($12).  they have daily specials that sound interesting, but be sure to ask about the price.\n\nservice was okay.  with about three wait staff people, i had to ask for my tea to be refilled almost every single time.  (they should have just left the pot for me after my fourth refill.)  they also never bothered refilling our water.  with all the sodium, liquids were necessary!\n\nthe menu is simple, but can be a bit overwhelming your first time there.  we found the whole oden (dashi broth pot) menu to be a bit daunting with the per piece charge and probably wouldn't have ordered anything from here if it were just the big f and i.  the robata grill menu is where it's all out.  however, since they charge per skewers, you'll end up ordering the $28 kobe beef steak and not realize it!  their rice/noodle/soup menu sounds good, but worries me when i read \"bite size salmon roe bowl\" for $10.  is it really bite-size?\n\nin regards to the bathroom, i didn't see what the big deal was.  sure, it's aesthetically pleasing with bird sounds and fake flowers.   but nothing worth making a special visit out of it.  it's a new restaurant and a new bathroom, therefore it's clean!\n\nas recommended, make reservations.  it wasn't really necessary last friday evening when we went, but it does fill up and people do take their time.  so i would definitely try to make reservations if my party is more than two.  \n\noverall, we did enjoy our experience here, but found it to be quite expensive.  $150 for 4, including tip and tax, with no alcohol seems a bit costly.  (none of us were 'full' since we headed over to luv-it's for dessert!)\n\n3.5 stars.\n\n(pics posted!)", 
            "he heard so many things about this place and always wanted to try it. so i surprised him and took him there for his birthday. we had about 14 dishes totalling about $125 for our entire bill. plus i called and made a reservation and told them it was his birthday...and we got the private dining room plus they came out with a dessert for him at the end. \n\nwe had so many dishes...\n\nfried homemade tofu in hot broth (<mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark>) - you have to got try!!! the broth is sooo tasty and yummy!!\nkobe beef outside skirt with garlic - to die for!!! the garlic chips are awesome, and you can taste the quality in the kobe beef\nkobe beef liver - i'm not really a liver kind of girl or anything that tastes or smells gamey, but my bf loved it!\ngrilled duck with balsamic soy sauce - not as impressed as i thought i would've been\nfoie gras - i wish my bf never told me what this really was. it was good until he told me it was duck liver; then i felt the texture hit the roof of my mouth and i just couldn't do it. but it was good to say the least.\nbutter saut\\u00e9ed scallop with soy sauce - all i can say is omg!!!! it is one of the best things i had tasted!\nsea urchin <mark>Sunomono - Cucumber And Seaweed</mark> with soup - i'm not into the sea urchin stuff, but my bf swallowed in in 0.2 seconds and loved it!\n\nand a few of their specials\nred snapper sashimi - omg!!!! best red snapper i've ever tasted\nmini crabs - this little creatures were amazing! surprisingly. if you're not into eating something that's looking straight at you, don't get it. but if you're ok with it, i say try it!\niwana (i think that's what it was called; it was a little grilled fish) - yummy!!\n\nand for dessert\nfluffy cheesecake - really soft, but tastes more like a brick of straight cream cheese\ngreen tea brulee - so goooddd! lol!\n\n**oh and we started off with the sake sampler for $14...it was good!\n\nthe money spent was worth trying all of these dishes! they were amazing!!! you just need to try it! it's delicious!", 
            "i was here over the weekend and i already miss the food. we had reservations, so there was no wait. our servers were attentive and friendly, and the food was amazing! everything we had was really fresh and cooked just right. i have no complaints. our bill came out to be $240.00 including tax and tip for a party of 3 (no alcohol). well worth it for and great dining experience. i can't wait to go back!\n\nsome recommendations:\nsteam clams with sake \nuni <mark>Sunomono - Cucumber And Seaweed</mark> soup\nkobe beef filet with wasabi robata\nkobe beef skirt with garlic robata\nenoki mushroom wrapped with bacon\nbite size foie gras bowl\nfluffy cheesecake", 
            "when the lights go out on the strip, where do the chefs and restaurant staff go to eat?\n\nraku! \n\nwell what can i say? obviously, people working in the restaurant industry have very good and discerning taste. \n\nif you come to raku expecting to eat maki rolls, you will be disappointed. japanese cuisine is so much more beyond maki rolls. no, japanese don't eat sushi everyday.\n\nraku has many items as part of the daily special that are written on a portable blackboard. our server brought the board to our table and went through each of them. we ended up ordering many items from the specials because they were too good to pass up on.\n\nhighlights from the specials:\n\n*seigo (japanese sea bass)*\nchoose 2 out of 3 methods of preparation: sashimi, grilled, fried.\nthe order is for a whole fish. based on our chosen method of sashimi and grilled, half of it was delicately sliced into sashimi. the other half was grilled to perfection (head and tail included)\n\n*bai gai (japanese sea snail)*\nsuch beautiful snail shells! our server told us that the snails are first cooked for 7-8 hrs until tender and then they are steamed to order.\n\n*kushi (kobe beef tongue)*\nsmall pieces came on a yakitori stick. drizzled with intensely flavorful sauce.\n\n*kakuni (pork belly)*\nbraised until very tender. we ate up both meat and fat without guilt.\n\nitems we ordered from the regular menu which were equally amazing:\n\n*raku tofu*\nthis is their signature housemade tofu. our server told us that raku makes their tofu fresh everyday. the tofu was unlike any other we've had. the texture was extremely creamy. it is meant to be sprinkled with some green tea salt made with mushroom <mark>Sunomono - Cucumber And Seaweed</mark>. and then enjoyed with soy sauce, scallions, and bonito flakes.\n\n*<mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark>*\nalso uses the housemade tofu, slightly fried on the outside, and served with dashi sauce, roe, tiny mushrooms, and japanese chilli paste on the side.\n\n*<mark>Juicy Deep Fried Chicken</mark>*\nthis is similar to karaage (<mark>Juicy Deep Fried Chicken</mark> cutlets). the chicken was unbelievably moist and it was fried until it just crossed over from rare to cooked. i don't know how the chefs timed it that well, but it sure prevented an overcooked and dry meat.\n\n*oden (fish cakes)*\nwe selected several types of fish cakes that were served in dashi broth. other items we chose were daikon and pork intestines. oden is especially popular in winter in japan.\n\nif you're visiting vegas and have no access to a car like us, we hopped into a cab from our hotel and raku is just a short ride away. we called for a cab after we were done with dinner. no hassle. make reservations!", 
            "loved the foie gras yakitori (since ca banned it, this is heaven!), age tofu was out of this world and they made the tofu in house fresh, topped with ikura <mark>Sunomono - Cucumber And Seaweed</mark> and the broth was just nice, not too salty or sweet. very delicate! <mark>Poached Egg</mark> with sea urchin and ikura was very tasty and super duper fresh! chicken teba wing was juicy and crispy on the outside, nice. kurobuta pork cheek was the best, tender and not too salty, and crispy. oden was just ok, i had better one. the butter sauteed scallop with soy sauce was devine (a bit small for $7). we came at 11:30 midnight because they were super small and busy. a lot of items were sold out, so bummed. we wanted to try the <mark>Juicy Deep Fried Chicken</mark>, <mark>Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard</mark>, kobe beef tongue, oyakodon, green soba, the little hot pot on small fire stove, and <mark>Crispy Fried Shrimp</mark>. oh, they had 2 bathrooms, the prettiest i have ever seen! the sea ocean theme with aquarium and nice ocean ceiling, lighting and wall, and nice bedat seat. the other bathroom was a jungle theme with rose petals, big tree trunk and leaves flowers ceiling, with bird chipping music, so soothing! a definite must try in vegas!!!!", 
            "after being disappointed with carnevino and resigned to bouchon, possibly that my expectations for the food town that is las vegas were a wee bit too high. it casted doubts on my joel robuchon, which is not something i will readily admit, considering it's a 3-michelin star place, and one of his only restaurants in the states. but i did, because i knew i needed to choose between his place at the mgm grand, or raku, the sushi place off strip that anthony bourdain dinedwith penn jilette on parts unknown. \n\nso raku is the choice i made - a sushi house that does take reservations, but not for the bar - a sushi house that is dark and small, with some hidden doors that i can only assume meant deliciousness.\n\nwe sat in the back for around 10 minutes before being seated at the sushi bar - the bar one of the more unusual ones i've seen. there is no glass case of already sliced fish, a display to choice from, but instead a display behind them like a fish market - whole fish that were recently purchased, staring at us while we're served.\n\nthey were polite until the hostess and one of the chefs realized that while i was no expert or aficionado, i wasn't an amateur either. after that, they were curious and attentive. they serve not one single roll - which was something i delighted in - so i ordered omakase. mr. v choose small a la carte meals.\n\nhe ordered a range of dishes that both swim on this earth and walk its hard grounds.\n\n-one scallop dish that was seared very softly served in its own shell, with a mixture of soy sauce, ponzu, and scallions.  \n-mushroom wrapped in bacon - not very japanese like, except for the ponzu basted on the mushroom tops, and devoured nonetheless.\n-kobe beef skewers in a dark, sticky sweet plum sauce, each bit just a morsel bigger than a bite, hot and soft, like butter in your mouth.\n-foie gras over house made tofu, swimming in a miso-like broth, topped with impossibly thin sliced scallions and sea salt.\n-pork short ribs that were more than just ala carte - piping hot, sticky salty sweet sauce that pooled around the bones after eaten, falling off after just one tender nibble.\n \nhis were delicious.\n\nmine are more difficult to remember, as when ordering omakase, they just keep bringing out food and happiness.\n\n-housemade tofu that was simply something i had never had before, prepared as it was. raku is known for it, so it makes sense that a large slice of the buttery soft white tofu was served - with ginger, fish flakes, scallions, sea salt, and soy sauce for dipping. i wanted to use my fingers, but alas, kept to the sticks.\n-tuna, salmon, and kanpachi sashimi with the customary bits of ginger (not touching), radish, <mark>Sunomono - Cucumber And Seaweed</mark> tucked neatly under each of the trios laid out. each piece was cold and had the nice meaty-fatty texture that one wants of sashimi from their chef.\n-grilled chicken skewers basted with a ponzu/soy sauce mixture that brought out the fatty bits of charred skin.\n-kobe beef skewers that i nibbled on and shared with mr. v.\n-foie gras skewers, which i'm such are a luxury in itself, as how am i supposed to eat them when they are so soft and gelatinous? dipped in a warm and sticky soy sauce, they were surely one of the richest foods i'd ever had - as it was my first time with foie gras.\n-kanpachi sashimi order (which was not omakase, but my own separate order - yes, i can eat that much) - it was of last meal caliber, and something i could've easily eaten every day. soft, never chewy, cool to the touch, just the right about of fatty white lines, melting as only fresh fish could.\n-ikura served over rice - ikura, singlehandedly one of my favorite foods as well - beautifully round salmon eggs that held so much saltwater that they were little bursts of ocean with every bite.\n-cheesecake fluff with a sliver of plum sauce, raspberry sauce, and a cross between chocolate and hazelnut crumbles.\n\nthis was the meal i was looking for when i came to vegas, and i'm not at all sorry i had to go off strip in order to get it. we were there from opening, which was 6pm to around 8:30pm. never once did i feel we had to leave, or were rushed, but that could've been the hostess impressed with my bottomless pit of a stomach."

            "raku is great.  there are some fantastic dishes, like their housemade tofu, their <mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark> (often run as a special, but pretty much has become a daily offering), the pork cheeks, the green tea soba, and their soy sauce!  (i think i heard once that they make it themselves?)  the only menu item i stay away from is the pickles-- i normally love oshinko, but i don't really like the pickles at raku because they're bland.\n\nthere are only a couple drawbacks.  first, the speed at which you get your food can be inconsistent.  last time i was there, we had to wait a good 45 minutes before we saw any food.  some times the food comes out very slowly, other times it's ok.  don't eat here if you're in a hurry-- we usually take a couple of hours for a meal.\n\nsecond, this is not a place i would be able to eat very often simply because much of the food is very salty and fatty.  don't get me wrong, i love salty and fatty, but a little goes a long way and it gets overwhelming at times.  for this reason, i don't eat here more than once a month.\n\nthird, some of the grilled items are cooked inconsistently.  the first time i ate at raku i was blown away by the beef tendon, which was very fatty and slightly gelatinous, but grilled and charred (so it was crispy and slightly bitter), and served with a sweet sauce.  delicious.  i've since ordered it several times, and it's never the same.  the last time i ate their (a few days ago), i swear it didn't go anywhere near a grill, so it was just pure fat and it was gross.\n\nnonetheless, this place is still one of my favorite restaurants i enjoy regularly!  very popular for locals in the restaurant biz.", 
            "try the tofu!  if they have a tofu special, get it!  they had the <mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark> as a special and it was absolutely yummy.  it came with fish eggs and spicy chili sauce on the side.  the best!\n\nwe also had the kobe filet with wasabi and it is all that the other reviewers have made it out to be, and more.\n\nit's hard to find good soba in this town and they did it perfectly.  it comes with bonito, fish eggs, shaved carrots and daikon.  very flavorful.\n\nanything with foie gras is terrific (and unique in a japanese restaurant) and the foie gras soup with noodles was no exception. \n\nthe only beer that they seem to have is sapporo on tap but i ain't complaining.  you can get a pitcher for $24 and that's enough for two big beer drinkers.\n\ndesserts are awesome and come with free barley tea, which is yummy and apparently unlimited because they just kept pouring.  we had the green tea creme brulee and the bubbling pudding.  both were excellent.\n\nthe restroom is also very interesting, as others have said.  fresh flower petals on the floor and the toilet tank.  fake flowers all over the ceiling and little birds chirping.  my husband said there was a $5 bill when he went in and asked me if that was part of the ambiance.  i don't think so.  either someone thought that they needed to tip or were really careless with their money.  he just left it there.  the decor was so random, he figured it was part of the scenery.  :)\n\nthe service was terrific.  i'm not sure what problems other people had, but the servers there were very good and responsive. \n\nfinally, make reservations!  it is really tiny and people who just show up have to wait (although they do give you free food if you wait really long... the table next to us waited about 45 minutes and got free shrimp).  we made reservations the day before with no problem.  but this may change because they just got the james beard award for best new restaurant in vegas.\n\nnext time i will see if we can get omakase and the sake tasting.  they have a sake tasting for $14.  you get three different kinds of sake.  but after a whole pitcher of sapporo, we were done.  i'll update if we manage to implement operation omakase.",

            "getting away from the strip just to have japanese bar food?  prior to coming to las vegas, i read a very small article on travel and leisure magazine about this place.  since it was up the street from the hotel i am staying, this trip transported me to japan via a strip mall.  i got in just as it opened and welcomed me ( in japanese) .  being the first customer there i recognized this is a small place(31 seats). reservations are a must .  but when you get in, be prepared to be amazed by the food presented at the table ( or bar).  anything  that you order will astound your taste buds, especially if  you order from the specials menu. their signature item is the <mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark>- tofu made in house with dashi broth, tiny mushrooms, fish eggs and a little hot sauce on rim of the bowl.  this will redefine what tofu should taste like- soft and silky smooth.  the kobe beef skewers were awesome: two skewers, one laced with garlic, the other  in miso.  but the third special item, negi toro, was sublime (toro chopped up fine to a near paste); combined with real wasabi and homemade soy sauce(yes, homemade, not kikkoman). service was exceptional and very friendly as if you were a long time customer.  definitely worth the flight back to vegas to eat again. p.s. check out the bathroom.", 
            "after all the reviews and all the buzz i decided to stop by and try this place. the place is small, i mean small but it was nice, very comfortable, cozy atmosphere. it is a challenge to locate this place but once you find it give yourself a boy/girl scout patch.\n\nthe food was delicious. my meal consisted of kobe beef skewers with wasabi, lamb chops, yellowtail tuna, <mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark>, pork belly, pork cheek skewers and foie grois. the menu was quite immense and the prices were not bad at first glance but everything adds up quick. the only thing i did not like is that some of the dishes started to taste similar due to the fact that it had the same base of sweet soy. the alcohol mark up was a bit high so be careful with your alcohol. overall, it was a great experience.\n\nps\n\nmake sure you ask the server how much the \"specials of the day\"  cost. they bring you a chalkboard with all the specials that sound so appetizing and you end up ordering a lot. . just be careful because it may surprise you when you get your check.",

            "located a short but beautiful cab ride away from the strip, through what i think of as little asia, sits raku at the back of a strip mall. it can be difficult to see raku from the street, where it is tucked away. in my mind i am calling the neighborhood little asia because the retail and dining options of china, japan, thailand, vietnam and more all merge together in shiny brightly lit strip malls merging as one long neon streak as your taxi zooms toward its destination.\n\nour server's husband was sitting at the bar with us, and it turns out he is a sake rep. it was a bit like sitting with our own personal sake sommelier. he works for world sake imports, and kindly and deftly guided us through a couple of beautiful sakes. i really have never met a sake i didn't like, so i am an easy and willing victim. we started with a 10 oz bottle of \"\" dewazakura \"sakura boy\". light and lovely, without any of the distinguishing melon flavors i sometimes love in a cold sake. this was slightly dry and linear and it was great.\n\nover our shoulder, we spied someone eating a beautiful giant squid dish that was not on the regular menu. the main body of the squid was served as sashimi, while the upper tentacles were marinated and grilled.  i love a little squid sashimi, and this was not a little. it can be hard to chew, so be careful how much you put in your mouth at once.  the tentacles were marvelous however, and we had no problem gobbling these down.\n\nanother item not on the regular menu you will find online, is a kurobuta pork belly in a dark sauce. delicious and incredibly fatty. in most western restaurants i find the pork belly to be cooked so that the fat is served more solid. the flavors here are delicious, but the meat fell from the flesh readily making it easy to separate the muscle from fat. please, don't hate me. each bite was still thoroughly embedded in silky fatty flavorful tissue. however, the amount of fat in the dish altogether was a little overwhelming. bitter greens on the side were psychotically and deliciously infused with fat and sauce. my mouth waters for them.\n\nhands down my favorite dish of the evening was the <mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark>. zomg. what? how have i never had this before? where can i get a los angeleno equivalent? the soft tofu here is homemade, served in a hot savory/sweet broth with green onions, ginger and ikura on top. i want a vat of this. i want to roll around in it like a dog. want.\n\nthe second bottle our new friend suggested was dewasansan junmai ginjo. this bottle exhibited more of the fruitlike flavors i love. it is so beautiful i treated myself to a glass a couple nights later at restaurant charlie, despite the fact that trotter's booze mark up is ass-rapingly ridiculous. $40 for a glass of veuve cliquot yellow label. really? i understand a healthy booze mark-up to cover costs, but trotter may have lost his mind a little. i digress. this is a fantastic sake, anytime, anywhere at any price (kinda).\n\nthe last item we nommed on was suggested by our friend the sake rep. a chicken breast wrapped in skin, from the robata.this was outstanding. the most succulent, tantalizing piece of chicken i have ever put in my mouth. it needed no sauce and no formal introduction.\nsuch a beautiful little breast of chicken, protected from the hot fires of the grill by an insulating piece of chicken skin.\n\ni was sent to raku by tony of sinosoul, as a sort-of challenge. he has deep disdain for the open door izakaya in monterey park, and i liked it quite a bit. my answer to this challenge is that one cannot compare the open door to raku, it is apples to oranges. the open door is a lovely little spot for fairly white-washed but yummy japanese pub food. raku is excellent, much more authentic food of the same genre but perhaps not always to the tastes of people who enjoy their food less exotic.", 
            "i must have drove past this place a million times without knowing the value of this restaurant. this clandestine restaurant is truly a diamond in the rough. raku seats 30 bodies max which is surprising because the korean bbq next door can seat 200 ghosts easy.  to say raku is the savior of their plaza is an understatement.\n\nthe ambiance:\ntight quarters, intimate, romantic, urban chic. you truly feel special the fact that you are the one getting served while the eyes of hundreds and vying for your spot. \n\nthe food:\nthe dishes speak for themselves. chef endo is my hero for crafting such wonderful treats. every dish feels like a million bucks.  the homemade <mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark> in soy sauce is like heaven. blue fin tuna special is as fresh as catching it yourself.  anything from the robata grill is fantastic. \n\nthe cost:\nso call me snooty for not loving the flavors of something non-organic. i prefer to pay more for organic free-range because i feel safe for my body.  corn fed things are not appealing to me. i live in vegas so i understand the glam but i still do not agree with the motto: \"well it's vegas, so let's hike up the price 100% so people think it's really quality.\" so for raku, the price is fair to my standards. presentation + quality of ingredient + creativity of flavors = $9 <mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark>. \n\nwoo hoo i found my favorite restaurant in vegas.", 
            "the <mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark> is the best thing i've eaten in las vegas in over four years. out of this world! here's how you eat it... first, enjoy the broth without mixing in the little toppings sitting on the puffy tofu cloud. this is a dish that morphs in flavor as you eat it. so, broth then broth + tofu (careful - extremely hot when it first is set before you). then as you eat your way around the garnish-toppings, toss in a little of the roe and toasted seaweed, and green onion. as you complete the dish, you'll notice the flavors changing as the broth is flavored with those little items. \n\nso simple, so heavenly. i dare anyone who doesn't like tofu to not love this dish. phenomenal.\n\npork cheek - very yummy with robata flavor. duck + balsamic, also tasty, but only three pieces. chicken in baby portabella - ok.\n\nbill: $20. still kinda hungry, but the <mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark> will bring me back.", 
            "the <mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark> is the best tofu preparation i've ever had; i can usually take or leave tofu, but this dish seduced me. i will never go to vegas again without stopping here to have some more of it. also the foie gras was excellent, as were the kobe beef, the pork belly, sashimi, everything.  the service was friendly and efficient; the wait staff were happy to explain menu items in detail; what they did not do was tell us the price of the specials on the board as they described them.  we foolishly ordered one of each, only to find when we got the check that they had each been $32!  they also charged me $30 each for my two glasses of house chardonnay.  that part we were able to straighten out, but i wonder about people who don't check their bill carefully.  i wouldn't like to think that they make this kind of error too often.  the food though, was to die for and the friendliness of their farewells to every party made this a wonderful experience over all.  ordering all the specials at $32 each was our mistake, we should have asked the price i guess.  each of the specials was perfect so we were happy to have had them anyway.", 
            "this place is one of my favorite restaurants !  the first few months that it first opened, i was coming here every few days.  it was costly , but well worth it.  costly , only because i would always get a bottle of sake and order some items off their special  menu.   that said, meals here are reasonable.\n       tofu wasn't one of my fav foods until  i tried it here.  their <mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark> and <mark>Tofu Salad</mark> are incredible !   fresh and oh so creamy (waitress said tofu is made daily ).  the other dishes i always get are lamb chops, fois gras , chicken breast w/skin, ground chicken , kobe beef w/wasabi, <mark>Sashimi Salad</mark>, and meat intestines in soup.  i usually get a few other items, but these are my core.", 
            "i finally made it here!!!!  i went with a group of 6, so we got a chef's tasting menu for $35 per head (pretty sweet deal).  i got the roasted green iced tea to start.  the food just kept coming so i hope i can remember it all.  i will have to come back with less than 5 people so i can order a la carte next time.\n\nwhen i got here, i sort of recognized the sushi chef, and he looked at me, but i could not place him.  he came out to talk to me, and remembered me from being a regular at the ka before the ka went waaaay downhill more than a year ago!  i was impressed.  his name is hiro.  he was so kind and also came out to greet me before i left.\n\nblah i know everyone has read that i don't eat pork, so i let everyone else eat the bacon-wrapped asparagus and pork cheek.  i did eat everything else though...fluke sashimi with ankimo (fish liver) and crunchy part of fish with spicy daikon, green onions, and ponzu.  sliced thin like you see fugu sliced.  what's not to like?  homemade tofu (like velvety cream) \"caprese\" with seaweed and tomatoes, <mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark> with ikura, fish gutted at our table with daikon then the bones and head were fried and returned, skewered chicken wrapped in its skin - sooo juicy, skewered tender medium rare beef with garlic chips, nut-crusted tempura asparagus, <mark>Juicy Deep Fried Chicken</mark> skin with spinach leaves and miso..the grand finale was a rice dish served in this big pot where the bottom crisped up the rice (we likey!!) with ikura, salmon flake, green onions, veggies...mmmmmm!!!  i am probably missing something.  we got hot tea at the end too.  service was great, place is really small and intimate.  extra points for matcha salt and shichimi togarashi on the tables!!!  i will definitely come back (who wouldn't?)", 
            "i went to raku really excited to try their food, only to find out their menu was quite limited for vegetarians. i made an exception that night in terms of eating benito fish (which i found out was in most japanese dishes, even the ones most ppl think of as vegetarian, including me), but even then there wasn't that many choices. \n\nthe <mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark> was excellent and the best i've ever had and i've had a lot of them. really delicious.\n\ni also had the grilled rice balls (miso and soya sauce). the miso one was quite good but the soya one felt a bit dry on the outside and didn't taste much.\n\nthe grilled tomatoes were pretty good and had a very strong bbq taste to them which my wife loved. idem for the asparagus.\n\nthe corn and potato dish was good, but nothing special.\n\ni had a good sake that tasted very light and fruity and complimented the food very well. i normally don't like sake (and alcohol in general) but this one, i liked. it's the first one on the sake menu under the 30% section.\n\ni might have had a couple of other things but i forget... i rate raku a 4 because what i had was just good but i also feel like i missed out on all the best they have to offer because of my vetegerianism. it really felt like an authentic japanese restaurant with traditional food and i just got a fraction of the culinary experience they offer. so i wouldn't find it fair to give them a lower rating.",

            "i really liked raku.  the place was very small and intimate, and the servers were really polite and helpful.  the decor has a very contemporary look, with dark wood tones.  they have a beautiful bathroom, with individually arranged flower petals on the far corner, and leaves and vines all over the ceiling.  very pretty.  \n\nthe regular menu has many treats, and the prices are really very low, though of course the portions are equally small.  much of the menu consists of robata-grilled skewer dishes, so they're fairly small, but they also mostly run about $4 or $5, with the really expensive things being stuff like kobe beef or foie gras.   something especially of note is the <mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark>, which is insanely good.  even if you don't like tofu, you'll like this tofu.  the special menu is where lots of interesting things are, which are different every day.  of note was a squid dish whose name i can't recall, but was amazing.\n\nchicken breast with chicken skin was amazing, enoki mushroom wrapped with bacon was good, kobe beef with wasabi was good, absolutely loved the duck skewers, and adored the <mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark>.  \n\nhow much you spend is directly dependent on how you buy the food, so pick and choose the things you most want to try if you're on a budget.  \n\nhighly recommended, especially for a romantic dinner for two.",

            "raku is a young restaurant, only two years old, but is quickly becoming popular because the food is exquisite and incredibly sophisticated, and the prices are absolutely reasonable.\n\nbefore i continue i'd like to give you an idea of how desirable this tiny restaurant is becoming. we walked in at 6:20, less than a half hour after they opened for service. we didn't have a reservation, but were lucky to get two seats at the five person bar that looks into the kitchen (this may have been a 'bad' seat to some, but i couldn't imagine a better one). not more than ten minutes after we sat down a guy walked in and asked the following questions (remember this is monday). q: 'do you serve alcohol?' a: just beer and wine; q: do you have sushi? a: no sir. q: can we get a table? a: for how many? eight people he responded. a: uh, no(sweetly, but without a hint of hesitation). the fact that he thought he could get a table for eight seemed utterly preposterous, and actually was. plus, he obviously thought this was sushi roku in caesar's, a common confusion amongst tourists. as we left at around eight o'clock, we overheard another gentleman. q: table for two? r: not until 10 pm. bottom line: make a reservation!\n\nnow for the food. i can best describe the dishes at raku as 'japanese tapas.' most of the items are done in individual portions on a robata grill (see description on blog)) or are enough for each person to have a couple of bites, more or less. we ordered the <mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark> (home-made deep-fried tofu in dashi broth), <mark>Sashimi Salad</mark> (they don't have sushi, yet sashimi is quite prevalent), bacon wrapped enoki mushrooms, kurobuta pork cheek, and steamed clams. when you order you're not sure what dish will come out when, but you can guarantee it won't come out quickly and you won't care once you try it. the <mark>Sashimi Salad</mark> ($9) came first tonight, and was the perfect start to the meal. it consisted of ridiculously fresh salmon, toro (tuna), and yellowtail (hamachi) on a bed of baby spinach, topped off with crunchy fried onions. the dressing consisted of three unique sauces that converge at the bottom of the bowl by the time you finish, enhanced by a swipe of a creamy and spicy fourth sauce on the side of the bowl. it's really hard to describe it without using the words 'oh my god.' then we had the <mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark> ($9), another dish best described with the words 'oh my god.' the different elements that make up this dish clearly exemplify the talents of the chef/owner, abriya raku. first of all, the tofu is made in house, and will make you think differently of tofu ever after. you can see how it might be easy to be a vegetarian if you could eat this on a regular basis. the dashi broth is sweet with intense flavor, and the mini accoutrement such as the baby mushroom heads (a variety i can't identify) floating on the surface, and the beads of salmon roe just pop in your mouth providing complimentary bursts of goodness. next we moved onto our bacon wrapped enoki mushrooms ($2.50) and kurobuta pork cheek ($2.50), both cooked on the robata grill. somehow this grill imparts an indescribable flavor into the food, even though the marking from it is subtle. my husband described it best: \"you could put s*** on that grill and it would come out tasting great.\" you'll be happy to know s*** isn't on the menu of interesting items like beef gut soup, but i think he's right. we finished with the steamed clams ($12), a special for the evening, which were the least impressive dish of the night. the broth was gentle in flavor without being dull, and the dish definitely showcased the clams themselves. the problem, however, is that manila clams aren't that exciting on their own and kind of need a powerful sauce to make them better (i.e the clams at cafe chloe or panna thai). this was the only dish we probably wouldn't order again, not because it was bad, but because so many other items shouldn't be passed up.\n\nthe last thing i would like to talk about are the condiments on the table. most dishes don't require them, but i think you should still try them to broaden your horizons. the soy sauce (bottle at back right) is a unique blend of five different imported kinds and will make you re-think soy sauce the way the tofu made you re-think tofu. the bottle in front of that is a chili sprinkle to add a little heat if you like, and to the left of that is special salt based on the sun-dried sea salt made in the classic shiota style. behind that is aged vinegar with peppers. each of them is constructed with care and love, and if there is that much effort spent on the condiments, it is only obvious that every other dish on the menu will be prepared with the same level of passion and expertise. if there is only one restaurant i've recommended that you must try, this is it.",

            "raku, how do i love thee?  let me count the ways...\n\nhaving read the extremely positive reviews by fellow yelp-ers, we cabbed over to raku on a monday for the 1st dinner of our recent vegas trip. we figured that the restaurant should be able to accommodate us given that our small party and it's a monday night; but we were wrong. raku is a restaurant popular amongst locals and you'd be wise to make a reservation in advance. the hostess initially told us that all the tables were booked and turned us away; we told her that we are quick eaters. ;) in the end, the manager gave us a table that is booked for a time slot 2 hours later. it's great to see that they respect and honor reservations.\n\nover the 1.5 hours we were at raku, we enjoyed every bit of it. i love that we could order individual servings of oden and yakitori skewer sticks at reasonable prices, much like how food is ordered at oden bar, yakitori bars in japan. home-made sauces (e.g. their own soy sauce) are available at the table. our waitress gave excellent recommendations.  the whole experience is well-paced and not rushed. \n\ndishes we loved -\n* home-made tofu: when our waitress asked whether we'd like the home-made tofu served regularly or fried. my husband and i blurted out different answers at the same time (!). the restaurant was nice to accommodate serving the tofu two ways so that we were able to experience both..and they both turned out to be delicious!  the raku tofu (non-fried version) sported natural flavors of the tofu, while the fried version tasted a little like <mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark> and came in a yummy broth.\n* sashimi: who would think that at an inland city offered such fresh raw fish?  we ordered the shiro ebi (white shrimp) sashimi and hirame sashimi. both were super sweet from their freshness and we got quite a bit of hirame from one order!\n* grill/yakitori skewers: you pretty much can't go wrong with any of their grill skewers. i especially liked the kurobuta pork cheek, foie gras, enoki wrapped in bacon skewers.\n* green tea cr\\u00e8me brul\\u00e9e: remember to save room for dessert!  the green tea cr\\u00e8me brul\\u00e9e was divine!\n\nwe can't wait till we return to raku again.  chef endo, please consider opening a place in the san francisco bay area!", 
            "for the atmosphere, the value, the consistency of the flavorful food and spectacular service, it really doesn't get better than this in vegas. \n\npork ears: grilled, slightly chewy and the cartilage is yummy.\n\nraku tofu: in-house fresh tofu turned over onto a plate with the basket's moulding still on the tofu. the tofu comes with very finely minced ginger and green onion. they recommend adding some soy sauce. the tofu is smooth and unbelievably soft. it's the best tofu i've ever had.\n\n<mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark>: fried tofu, very light batter, so it's crisp and not tough. it comes on top of a light soy-based sauce.\n\nconch: this was a special; it was expensive and not particularly tasty. it was also chewy. however, it's nice that they have specials on their blackboard menus, presented by the servers at your table-side.\n\nchicken wings: the chicken wings are flavorful and grilled on their binchyo charcoal grill. this kind of charcoal really gives the food a different flavor than other charcoal. \n\nskewers: there are many different kinds of skewers and they are all grilled on the same type of binchyo charcoal grill. nothing was disappointing, so you must bring many friends and try all the different skewers they have to offer, from chicken gizzard to bacon wrapped around scallop to shrimp. the skewer section has much to offer.\n\noden: i tried two different kinds of oden, but i wouldn't be surprised that all the other odens also taste very delicious. the two that i tried included the one with mochi wrapped in tofu skin with some daikon accompanying this delicious \"rice bag\" and a sweet vegetable broth. the other one was the oden with tendon. the tendon is perfect, comes with daikon also and is in the same vegetable broth. on the side of the oden bowl is a dash of srirracha and a dash of horse radish paste for you to add to the dish up to your liking. \n\nchicken tsukuni: this should be in the skewer section, but it's special enough to be in its own category. it's like chicken meatballs on a skewer and is very addictive. you might want more than one.\n\ngreen tea ice cream: good ice cream, weird combo that it came with chocolate sauce, but that might just be me.", 
            "a great place to go off the strip! this is a popular late night spot, so make  sure you have reservations or you will be turned away. the food here is delicious. they have an extensive menu and specials list. the skewers come to your table hot off the grill and is seasoned perfectly. <mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark> is amazing! the tofu itself is homemade and comes to you piping hot. i could eat this all by myself. a great place to try out a little bit of everything.", 
            "superb, says this sf/la couple. we were trying to keep the bill down so we ordered everything off the regular menu -- our bill was $80 without drinks, tax, or tip, and we were stuffed.\n\nbest dishes:\n\n<mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark>\nmushroom and bacon\n<mark>Crispy Fried Shrimp</mark>\nbrown sugar pudding", 
            "still delicious, still intimate, still one of the best in vegas.\n\nwe hit up raku again now that they've expanded, allowing a few more people to experience this fantastic place at a single time.  do yourself a favor and don't walk in - you likely won't get a table.  even on a tuesday, at 6pm.  they're likely booked to 11 by then.  reserve your table a day or so in advance and get in your 2 guaranteed hours of amazing food and intimate setting.\n\nthis time, we once again ordered the <mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark>, because... you can't not order it.  even if you don't like tofu, you will love this dish.\n\na special we tried this time were the small fresh crabs, lightly fried and served posed on a small long dish, as if they're in a little procession of deliciousness... right into your mouth.  they're maybe each as big as a 50 cent piece.  you pop the entire thing into your mouth and chew.  in a word - amazing.  i'm not a big crab lover, but these were tasty, well seasoned, and delicious.  the shell on them is so light there's no worry of impaling your mouth with a piece of them.  my wife devoured them and we almost ordered seconds.  she talked about them on the way home.  the next day.  just order them if they're available.\n\nthe core dishes that we re-visited from our previous trips are still excellent.  this time we also got 3 sake tasting special to sample with the meal and i was impressed not only with the choices (a filtered, an unfiltered, and a flavored one) but how inexpensive it was for the sampler ($14).  a good value and more than enough to keep a great mood through your meal.\n\nas an update to my last post, i must say that raku's desserts are quite excellent.  we've tried the different sorbets, the melty chocolate cake, the bubbly milk pudding, and they've all been wonderful.  now if they only offered a honey toast dessert....\n\nraku is continuing proof of a growing array of excellent restaurants that you don't have to walk through a casino to find here in vegas.  don't miss it!", 
            "his review is on.  it's delicious!  it's my favorite restaurant in vegas.  it's affordable.  the sake selection is great.  atmosphere, comfortable.  open late.\ni love the bacon wrapped asparagus and bacon wrapped enoki mushrooms.  i got brave and tried the kobe tendon which was delicious.  it taste like teriyaki mochi.  they are always out of the foi grois so i never get to taste that.  i love the salmon, and the hirami sashim (a special).  <mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark> is delicious!  chicken breast with chicken skin, and kobe beef with garlic is delic too.",

            "wow.\n\ni made late night reservations for raku on a thursday night.  as a fan of nearby ichiza and their izakaya cuisine, i had heard that raku served similar fare but was even better.  i was skeptical, but my sister swore by the place as well, having visited raku along with some foodie friends of hers.  if it hadn't been for her insistence, i'm not sure i would have squeezed a visit in my busy schedule.\n\ni am so glad i did.  \n\nthe taxi driver took us for a 10 minute drive off the strip into chinatown where raku is located.  a stereotypical strip mall store front greets you but inside the decor is modern and clean despite the small interior space.  patrons were at every table and it's clear late night dining is their strength as they open til 2 am.    \n\nafter a brief wait, our seats opened and we began to peruse the extensive menu.  grilled yakitori items, oden broths, appetizers, and plentiful drinking choices greeted us.  our plan of attack was simple: try a few things, get a few drinks, and continue as warranted.\n\nhours later, i had come to a clear conclusion : raku is quite simply the best japanese restaurant i have ever been to and one of the best restaurants period that i have ever enjoyed.  as a huge fan of this type of japanese cuisine, the preparation and presentation of all the dishes blew me away and it's been a long time since i've enjoyed a meal quite as much as i enjoyed this one.  kudos to my sis.  \n\na few standouts from among the 13 dishes i had:\n\nhouse-made cold and hot <mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark> - supremely fresh and soft with a hint of sweetness, i enjoyed both presentations.  the cold version is served with their signature green tea sea salt and their raku house soy sauce.  both taste completely unlike any condiment you've had and enhance the cold tofu wonderfully.  the hot tofu is served in a rich oden broth and served with salmon roe.  need i say more?\n\nbeef tendon oden broth and meat intestine oden broth - $1.50 each.  are you kidding me???  $1.50?!?!  that's it???  the single serving of tendon and intestine was flavorful, tender, and complemented wonderfully by the fantastic oden broth they make in house here.  i could order bowls of this stuff and stay all day.\n\nshima aji sashimi - fantastic cuts, served in three ways - on top of fresh seaweed, on top of soft glass noodles, and on top of a sauce.  fresh as can be....how do they get that in the dessert?\n\nnagareko - braised abalone in broth.  one of the most tender abalones i've tasted and not the least bit overdone.  a strong delicious broth of seaweed accompanied it and enhanced the abalone flavor and aroma.  top notch special.\n\ngrilled enoki mushroom with bacon, asparagus with bacon, and grilled chicken yakitori - i've had yakitori at many places, most notable sumika in los altos, but this was the best i've ever had.  fantastic flavors, super tender, and absolutely crispy high quality bacon.  it simply is another level beyond yakitori i've had before.  can't beat the $2-3 yakitori prices either (besides kobe beef)\n\nseafood with bonito guts - a favorite at kappo nami nami in mountain view, bonito guts are salted bonito intestines that go wonderfully with sake.   their version is mixed with high quality sashimi and uni.  \n\nbesides the food highlights, the drink menu is outstanding and goes wonderfully with the food.  fusion cocktails, japanese specialty beers, and an extensive sake litter  the menu.  but it was the wonderful hot house sake that i loved for both it's sweetness and it's modest $7 price per bottle.  \n\nif there are any misses at raku, they are the oyakodon (the one dish that disappointed....egg slightly overdone) and the desserts (interesting but not mindblowing).  otherwise, raku is one of the best japanese restaurants i've had and i immediately wanted to return the next day.  they have long been a top yelp restaurant and even been named restaurant of the year.  the hype matched the reality.  for you norcal japanese fans, think of the best of gochi, sumika, kappo nami nami combined and at even better prices and better quality.  i'm not sure you'll find food this good except in japan.  it's simply that great.  \n\nreservations are a must and late night dining is encouraged to avoid crowds.  raku accepts credit cards, including american express.", 
            "my husband and i fought over the uni soup, pork cheek, <mark>Fried Ice Fish</mark>,  <mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark>, and... well, almost everything! we're definitely going back next time we're in vegas!", 
            "sono resutoran wa totemo riipa desu ne? \n\nit's a small space in an otherwise unassuming shopping center with several other restaurants, including a korean bbq and monta noodle house. walking in, it's a relaxing space with lots of warm colored, glossy wood tables and intimate lighting. the decor is much nicer than you would anticipate from the surrounding neighborhood. they've recently received a bit of media praise and when we went there was only bar seating available despite it being after 1 am. our party of 2 had no problem with that and were seated by a cute waitress. it being the night before halloween, they were all in costume! fun! plus, everyone was speaking real japanese back and forth, from the waitress to the kitchen staff, not just pretending. \n\nwe were told we only had a half hour or so to order, so we gave the menu a run down and got to it. we started with a 10 oz bottle of cold sake. our waitress suggested that we try junmai ginjo 'dewazakura oka', a cherryblossom scented sake with a clean, smooth floral flavor and slight hints of fruit. i also ordered a green tea, which was forgotten, but i'll forgive them since it was packed and she may have thought i just changed my mind when we got the sake. our bottle was $18 and was enough for the two of us to share over our meal without becoming perilously incapacitated. because sake is a sobriety ninja like that, it'll slap you silly when you don't expect it to if you're not careful!\n\nthe food:\n- uni in seaweed soup: the uni was sublimely sweet and creamy with a warm exterior from the rich dashi-type broth. it was presented in an adorable wooden bowl with the uni nestled among the seaweed like eggs in a nest. the seaweed was well prepared, with a firm texture and bite. i hate slimy seaweed and this was definitely well prepared quality wakame.  - $4\n- <mark>Sashimi Salad</mark>: 3 types of sashimi on tender baby spinach leaves with a savory/sweet dressing, crisped shallots or bonito & a smear of a spicy paste on the side that could be mixed into the salad. it was light and refreshing, with sweet pieces of fish. when served, the waitress told us which pieces were what, a nice attention to detail that i appreciate. high spinach to fish ratio, but it's $9 and it was the largest dish we were served.\n- kobe beef filet with wasabi: j's favorite, for sure. i really enjoyed this! the piece was roughly 4\" long and 1/2\"x1\" on a skewer with a thin line of wasabi along top. the meat was perfectly cooked and melted as i bit into it. i would go back for this item alone. at $9.50 for a relatively small portion of meat, it's not exactly budget dining, but it's a lovely option to have and still much more affordable than any of the premier steak houses.\n- kobe beef skirt with garlic: also fabulous, though it's hard to say if i liked this or the wasabi one better. this had a different grain and so a different overall mouth feel, but still melted apart as i bit into it. the flavor was great, clean, quality beef with crispy pieces of garlic in a row along the top. at $6 it's a little more affordable than the filet, and i can see ordering many rounds of this item with some friends.\n- asparagus with bacon: 3 asparagus tips wrapped in small pieces of bacon and grilled. it's a simple idea and presented in a small portion. the asparagus still had a crisp bite and the bacon added a nice smoky flavor, but i don't know if i'd want to order this again. $2.50 for 3 bite size pieces of asparagus is a bit much for me. \n- house tofu, 1/2 hot & 1/2 cold: the cold tofu came out first. it had a consistency like mascarpone or creamy cheese, with a very cooling sensation in the body. it was served with lots of thin, flaky bonito, green onions and grated ginger as well as a small offering of sauces/salt that wait on the table. i enjoyed this dish a lot but the boy didn't. definitely a different beast than the cubes of tofu you can buy in most grocery stores. i topped it with all the plated options and a drizzle of the umeboshi spiked soy sauce. yuuuuum!\nthe hot tofu was fried, giving it an interesting textured skin and a creamy interior. the broth it came in was dark, with a rich mix of flavors. orbs of ikura floating on top with a few baby mushrooms in the broth provided great textural interest, especially the briny bursts of flavor the ikura provided in contrast with the creamy tofu interior. i like it better than many of the <mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark> i've had elsewhere and it stands unique from it's peers. $10 for the two tofu dishes, but it was a lot of tofu! this was easily the second largest order we recieved.\n- kurobuta pork cheek: skewered bits of crispy fatty meat. it has a different texture than some would probably like- with a texture that's an cross between gizzard [crunchy yet chewy, gristly, fatty] and bacon. it didn't taste greasy or heavy, and was recommended by our waitress. i liked it but it won't be the first thing i have to order upon returning. $2.50", 
            "hubby and i went here back in august and i haven't had a chance to write my review.  the chef worked up some sexy food.  the flavors of the food were amazing and reminded me of guu in vancouver.  however, raku takes this type of food to another level.  we ordered so much food but the most memorable was the <mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark>.  i think it's housemade.  there's a subtle sweetness to the tofu that leaves me wanting more and more.  dinner for two was around $150.  i recommend making a reservation since the place is small and usually packed.  i prefer the robata grill items over the sushi.   and if you must, check out the bathroom.  if you are a bird fan, well it might just be your thing but me... it was just a tad creepy.  -m2", 
            "i have to just say that i can't speak for what's on the menu.  my friends and i did a $50 omakase (chef's choice) and here's what came out:\n\n1.  salad with fresh hamachi, salmon and ahi sashimi.\n2.  caesar salad with crunchy shrimp (?) instead of croutons.\n3.  seki saba sashimi (the only type of saba you can eat raw).\n4.  bacon wrapped mushrooms.\n5.  yakitori (chicken) skewers.\n6.  pork butt skewers.  so yummy!\n7.  grilled salmon with ikura and daikon.\n8.  chicken popsicles.  it wasn't called that but it looked like a drumstick made with ground chicken and i didn't know the name of it.  lol\n9.  wagyu beef sticks with crispy garlic slices.\n10.  <mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark>.\n11.  uni with soba noodles and ikura, served in the uni shell.\n12.  super light and fluffy cheesecake, topped with raspberries.\n\nthat is by far, the best $50 omakase dinner i've ever had and would definitely recommend checking this place out.  next time, i'll have to look at the menu to see what can be ordered and what can't but i can't wait to go back and have been raving it about it to all my friends.  go!", 
            "i'm stoked that my 100th review will be for such a great restaurant!\n\ni have been wanting to try raku ever since i heard about it. the first couple times we tried to go, we called that day and they were booked until way past my bedtime. so we decided to plan ahead and made reservations a couple of weeks in advance. i wanted to make sure and try the best items so when we made our reservations, i requested the $75 omakase dinner. \n\nfor our first course we had the <mark>Sashimi Salad</mark>. this was one of my favorites of the night. it came with 2 dressings, one spicy and one sweet. the fish was high quality. the crisp onions on top provided a nice flavor and textural contrast. it was a lovely way to start our meal.\n\nnext we were served raku's tofu. they make their own tofu and it comes with bonito, green onion, and ginger. the waitress suggested using the green tea salt and soy sauce to season it as well. the soy sauce is homemade and has a slightly sweet flavor. the tofu had a creamy, smooth texture. i never imagined imagined eating plain tofu and liking it, but i did.\n\nfor our third course we had <mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark> which was deep fried tofu in a miso broth topped with salmon roe. it was exceptional. this was another of my favorites of the night. i don't know how they make tofu so delicious!\n\nnext up was grilled tomatoes. they had a nice charcoal grill flavor.\n\ncourse 5 was <mark>Juicy Deep Fried Chicken</mark>. it was served on a bed of spinach and had awesome crispy skin with sesame. it was indeed juicy and very tasty.\n\nwe then had asparagus with bacon. it consisted of 3 small spears of asparagus wrapped in bacon. the bacon had a nice smoky grilled flavor.\n\nour seventh course was butter sauteed scallop with soy sauce. the scallop was nicely cooked and the sweet soy sauce complemented the dish nicely. this was in my wife's top three dishes.\n\nour next dish was yellowtail with glazed soy-based sauce. it was served with minced radish. the radish made the dish go from good to great. it was a perfect pairing.\n\nnext up was chicken wrapped with skin. it was salty and was a great contrast to the previous slightly sweet courses. the skin was sinfully good.\n\nwe then were served kurobuta pork cheek. it was chewy and reminded me of steak fat. that might not sound appetizing, but it was really good.\n\nfor our 11th course we had kobe beef outside skirt with garlic. my wife loved how the garlic chips complemented by the beef. i liked it too, but by this time i was getting full.\n\nnext was another of my favorites, <mark>Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard</mark>. the custard was beautifully cooked. it was served in a delicious broth. though i was getting full by now, i couldn't stop eating it.\n\nafter that we were served tsukune grilled ground chicken. it looked like a chicken sausage. i was stuffed so i only ate a bite and took the rest home.\n\nwe then were given grilled rice balls. one was flavored with soy sauce and the other with miso. i only had a bite and packed the rest.\n\nlastly, we were given two desserts. first up was green tea creme br\\u00fbl\\u00e9e. the green tea ice cream was subtly flavored and just slightly sweet. it was a nice balance to creme br\\u00fbl\\u00e9e.\n\nour other dessert was cheesecake. it had raspberries hidden inside. i love raspberries, and when i ate the raspberry sitting on top of the cheesecake i exclaimed, \"that's a nice raspberry!\"  the cheesecake was fluffy and airy. it was served with a delicious raspberry sauce and green tea salt.\n\nplaying in the background was japanese elevator music, including a rendition of michael jackson's \"beat it\" which was pretty neat.\n\nthe bathroom has artificial grass on the floor, a fake tree growing up the wall, foliage on the ceiling, birds playing in the background, and flower petals on the floor. a must see!\n\nthe meal was definitely delicious, but i think we should have gone with a $50 omakase meal as there were about five too many courses. i well definitely go back! can't wait to try my favorites again and sample some new dishes!", 
            "excellent service marked by even better food. yui and maiko (?sp) are super sweet and explain everything to a t.\n\nit's a small place and reservations are recommended. every time my boyfriend and i walk in we are accommodated. so thats a plus. \n\nsake tasting is the way to go here as far as alcohol. the cold sake cocktails are also delicious.\n\nbe sure to order the deep fried housemade tofu with salmon roe and this amazing broth! (<mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark>) you will not regret it! it is awesome. another staple for me is the pork cheek skewers. those are delicious!\neven the simple things like boiled eggs or a kombu broth are good.\ni also had my first cold soba noodle experience here and it was great! it was so homey and comforting for something served cold.\nthere really isnt anything that isnt good on this menu.\n\nsome things can be pricey, but you can go as high or low as you want because they are small dishes. \n\ngreat place to unwind after work!", 
            "after seeing all the stellar reviews, i knew that j and i had to have our last meal in vegas together at raku (especially since we still had our rental car!). unfortunately, because j's flight was at 8:45, we ended up rushing through our meal.\n\nservice: fabulous. the staff was super accommodating, and took care of all our needs; they didn't even bat an eye when we asked them to rush our orders. 5 stars\n\nambiance: good amount of lighting. very cozy. i loved the extremely authentic vibe, and the fact that so many of the patrons were obvious regulars. \n\nfood: very good. we had:\n- kurobuta pork cheek: probably the worst of the grilled items we ordered. for whatever reason, the meat was extremely chewy, to the point of being inedible in some cases.\n- yellowtail: ooh so good. so well prepared-- seared on the outside and slightly rare on the inside, extremely tender and delicious. my fave of the night\n- homemade <mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark>: very unique, and when paired with ikura and the soy based broth... yum yum\n- balsalmic glazed duck: good, but nothing to write home about\n- beef tendon oden: extremely tender beef. i thought there would be more broth, but this was pretty tasty\n\noverall: i would love to dine at raku again... next time for a more leisurely meal. i reserve that 5th star for my visit in the future!", 
            "my boyfriend mentioned this place last year and i thought he said roku so i went to sushi roku. one year later, i've finally made it. please make a reservation because they will not take you without one. walk-ins are only accepted if a party does not show up and the likelihood of that happening is pretty slim. we tried to walk in on a tuesday with no luck but luckily got an early thurs reservation.\n\ni think we ordered about 1/2 the menu. i won't go through all the dishes but each and every single dish was solid. from the grill, i love their pork ears. they are fatty and crispy at the same time. they just melt in your mouth. you can also get half orders of the raku/<mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark>. the tofu here is absolutely amazing! it's very very smooth. raku's tofu is served cold with bonito shavings, ginger and scallions. <mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark> is lightly fried and served hot in a soy sauce like sauce. you have to try it both ways to get the full effect. \n\nmixed thoughts on the service. it feels like they usually have good service but slipped up tonight. we were seated and forgotten for a good 15 min before someone came to take our drink order and give us a second menu.  our reservation was for 6pm. at about 5 minutes to 8pm, our last order was served. we then wanted to place our last 1 grill item and dessert order. she said something to the likes of \"oh but you have this table to 8pm. they didn't tell you?\" uh...no. she was very nice about letting us stay but it was still an awkward exchange. another table near us was also politely kicked out. perhaps this was all because they had a big party that night. what's kind of neat is the waitress always asks if she can take your empty bowl even when it's clearly empty and by the side of the table. so polite!\n\nall in all, raku is a very well rounded restaurant. i definitely prefer this atmosphere over the foofy casino restaurants. for the same price, you get better quality food too.", 
            "raku continues to impress each and every time.  i took my fianc\\u00e9 for his birthday and chose the secret menu option of omakase.  okay, okay, it's not really secret, but i love calling unlisted menu options \"secret\".  i like pretend that i'm part of a secret foodie society of delicious food.  my first visit a couple years back was perfect.  this last visit just solidified how amazing raku can be in terms of the consistency and quality of its food.  it also helps that the service is always very efficient and friendly.\n\nfor omakase, there are three tiers to choose from $50/$75/$125.  being that it was it was for his birthday, i decided to go middle baller style - $75!\n\n1.  saba/mackerel sashimi - mackerel doesn't have the same reputation of its fatty counterpart of oh toro, but leave it to raku to take it up to to the highest notch of freshness.  just a tiny dab of wasabi and the tiniest dab of their house made soy sauce was the perfect combination of flavor.\n2.  <mark>Sashimi Salad</mark> with baby spinach, salmon, yellowtail - the best <mark>Sashimi Salad</mark> ever because the fish was perfectly fresh, the spinach perfectly crisp, the soy sauce dressing combined with deep fried onions (?) was texturally and flavor wise on point!\n3.  house tofu (chilled) with side of bonito flakes - we had this with a little bit of green tea infused salt.  this was our least favorite of the night because we usually like our tofu with sauce, so it was a little dry for our tastes.  however, for a purist tofu lover, this is probably a good dish to have this was pure soy goodness.\n4.  clams - these were simply cooked in a clay pot.  they were a bit on the salty side, but i definitely enjoyed the seafood enfused essence of the clam broth.\n5.  unagi salted and unagi with light glaze of kabayaki sauce - raku has introduced me to the true form of unagi.  i think that i've been eating poor representations of unagi slathered in way too much kabayaki sauce, but this time i know i had the real thing!  the dish consisted of delicately grilled fresh water eel, one side lightly salted, one side lightly glazed in kabayaki sauce.  fantastic.\n6. charcoal grill items (mushroom skewers, <mark>Juicy Deep Fried Chicken</mark> skewers, pork cheek skewers, kobe beef skewers) - premium ingredients with smoky flavors and not an ounce of dryness or chewiness!\n7. <mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark> - this is our favorite at raku, and it did not disappoint.  it is their house made tofu deep fried and presented in their broth.\n8. raspberry sorbet - i'm usually not a fruity flavor dessert kind of gal unless it's fresh cut fruit, so i definitely did not enjoy this to the fullest.  the sorbet was more icy than smooth, but definitely had some intense raspberry flavor.\n\nconclusion:  raku chews up other japanese restaurants and spits them out kindly, politely and with flourish.  they win hands down.", 
            "this might be our favorite restaurant experience of all time.  hidden in a strip mall, raku instantly surprises you with decor that is modern and stylish and yet reminiscent of a traditional restaurant in japan.\n\nthe food is truly amazing here.  a mix of standard and original dishes, smartly conceived, and expertly prepared with very fresh ingredients.  every offering is an adventure in flavor and texture.  i've often wondered what it must be like to sit at the judges' table of the original iron chef, but i can't imagine it's much better than having a meal at raku.\n\nsome highlights:\n\n<mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark>: creamy and smooth tofu delicately fried and served in a savory broth.  loved it, and i don't even particularly like tofu.\n\n<mark>Poached Egg</mark> with sea urchin and salmon roe, with okra and daikon and mushrooms and broth: so much contrast between the different ingredients, and yet it all makes for a great dish.\n\n<mark>Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard</mark>: heavenly.\n\ngrilled foie gras: sinful.\n\n<mark>Sashimi Salad</mark>: very fresh fish on a bed of greens, lovely dressing, crispy fried onion topping.\n\nfluffy cheesecake: beautifully presently, wonderfully light.  a sublime finish.\n\nthe wait staff was very welcoming, friendly, responsive, and helpful.  on top of everything else, the portions are relatively large, and the prices are quite affordable for the quality of food.  my wife and i had about 9 different dishes, were totally satisfied, and made it out with a total bill under $100.\n\nvisit both restrooms.  very pleasant and surprising.\n\nif you're in vegas, forgo the restaurants on the strip and visit raku.", 
            "i give this place 3.5 stars, but i don't think yelp allows me to give half stars.  however, i would lean to a 4 than a 3 star.  i would recommend this place to someone that has never been to this style of japanese restaurant.  it's just i've been to better ones in los angeles.\n\nthe kobe beef was ok.  the cheap price made it palatable, in terms of kobe beef prices.  the kobe beef skirt steak was better for me than the kobe beef with wasabe.  i guess i like the garlic taste better on the skirt steak versus the wasabe. \n\nthe duck with balsamic vinegar was really good.  it was very soft and juicy.  i would recommend anyone to try this dish.  \n\ni would also recommend trying the crispy/crunchy asparagus.  i would normally order the asparagus wrapped with bacon, but the crispy asparagus was surprisingly good.\n\ni tried both kinds of tofu and both were pretty good.  the cold tofu was delicious.  it was soft and melted in your mouth.  the <mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark> was good, but i liked the cold tofu better.\n\none thing i was disappointed about this place was that they did not have quail egg wrapped in bacon, which is normally served at these restaurants. \n\nif you plan to go to this place, make a reservation at least a week ahead.", 
            "raku is what i would call las vegas' most avant garde japanese izakaya in the city. the food at the restaurant is about as authentic and minimal as any restaurant on the japanese islands themselves. the chef of the restaurant is well renowned for making his own tofu and soy sauce and the dedication to his craft shows in every dish that is served in raku. \n\nthe ambiance of the place is cozy while maintaining an air of exclusiveness that most patrons seem to relish in. although it's no longer the prized hidden jewel of the city, most people that give raku frequent patronage still regard the small restaurant as a secret treasure. \n\nthe menu is interesting and filled with unique ingredients that are designed for more sophisticated palates. if fois gras, beef liver, sea urchins, tendons, and pork ears are all new to your culinary vocabulary, raku might not be the place for you.\n\nthe \"<mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark>\" is the must have item on the menu. traditionally, <mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark> is a type of battered tofu that is fried until the outside is golden brown and then served with tentsuyu broth, grated daikon (type of asian radish), and bonito flakes. the raku specialty way of making <mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark> is unrivaled with any other restaurant in the city that offers the same selection.\n\nthe <mark>Poached Egg</mark> with uni (sea urchin) and ikura (salmon caviar), is another absolute favorite. the silky and rich smoothness of the uni paired with the buttery thickness of the bursting egg yolk goes perfectly with the salty pop given off by the ikura. \n\nraku offers a decent selection of japanese sake for you to sample. a lot of women tend to love the sparkling sakes that they offer here. as a note of advice to all sake drinkers, do not order hot sake or ask them to heat a bottle of cold sake. the japanese heat lower grade sake to mask its flaws. anytime one heats alcohol, it renders the characteristics of the alcohol obsolete and thus any sake served hot is because it is ultimately a low quality sake that isn't worth drinking cold.", 
            "good to try something other than sushi, ramen, or udon. the food was delicious and the service was good. i recommend the <mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark> and the duck.  two really great dishes. \n\nthe real question is, would i make this a regular spot? ...no. sorry. there's something fun but not filling about constant small plates. the prices are a little high but not unreasonable. (three people/85% full/$150) i agree with other yelpers that the rave reviews may be from people who haven't experienced a robata grill or good oden. honestly, i would rather head next door to monta, order tonkatsu ramen and kimchi fried rice and be happy, full, and save $120 bucks!", 
            "a definite dining experience!!!\nthings i absolutely loved:\n<mark>Sashimi Salad</mark> -  loved the salad dressing... and the hint of spiciness!\n<mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark> - super yum... a little fishy with the salmon roe, great texture of their homemade tofu, warm, great broth!\n<mark>Juicy Deep Fried Chicken</mark> - heavenly!!!  i don't know how they cook this, but it's the most moist <mark>Juicy Deep Fried Chicken</mark> ever!!!  and the fried skin around it just makes everything ridiculously good... and of course the spinach with dressing only adds to the flavor and the experience... definitely my favorite!\n\ni also absolutely loved their restroom... the decor creates an ambiance!  everyone must visit the restroom... \n\nthings that were good:\nkobe beef w/ garlic - it was good... definite quality!\nraku's tofu - it's a very interesting texture... it's homemade tofu... at first, it tasted very thick (kinda like whipped cream cheese)... but it is good, especially with bonito flakes, green onions, ginger, & soy sauce!\nduck w/ balsamic soy sauce - it's different than typical duck.. almost didn't taste like duck.. it was tasty!\nmushroom w/ bacon - anything w/ bacon is good... need i say more?\ngreen apple cocktail - it was good, sweet... almost like green apple martini but couldn't taste the alcohol\n\nthings that were interesting:\nfluffy cheesecake - consistency of whipped cream cheese... kind of good, but my taste palate was confused because it didn't taste quite like cheesecake... it was very smooth, tasted better w/ green tea powder... not sure if i liked it or not... \ntangerine orange sorbet - it was like shaved iced w/ orange syrup.. it was refreshing and tasty but once again, not what i expected of sorbet... \n\noverall, i was very pleased with my dining experience... and i would definitely go back!", 
            "4.5 stars\n\nraku is one of the off-strip las vegas restaurants i hear most about. raku's charcoal-grilled robata is one of the restaurant's specialties, but they also offer a variety of fresh fish and an assortment of cold and hot plates. before going in, i asked around for recommendations and the answers i got spanned the whole menu. clearly, the restaurant does a lot of things well.\n\nwe ordered a bunch of things in no particular order, but started with an amuse from the kitchen.\n\ntaiwanese spinach, enoki mushrooms, shitake mushrooms, bonito flakes - light and refreshing, this was a nice start to the meal.\n\nbluefin tuna sashimi - the restaurant has a chalkboard of daily specials, and this was one of them. oh my goodness...this was fantastic. exceptionally flavored and really tender, this was so good. easily better than much of the toro (and this wasn't toro) i've had in other restaurants; it briefly reminded me of urasawa.\n\n<mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark> - this homemade tofu was very good - soft and delicate with a subtle but present soy flavor. prepared agedashi style, the umami-rich broth was also very good.\n\n<mark>Crispy Fried Shrimp</mark> - the shrimp here were crispy as advertised and moist on the inside. nothing special really, but good. i'm never really sure if i'm supposed to eat these sort of things in its entirety, shell-on; but we did in this case.\n\n<mark>Crispy Asparagus Okaki</mark> - another crispy dish, i enjoyed the contrasting tenderness of the asparagus with the crispy rice cracker breading. there was a nuttiness to the breading, which i thought also went well with the vegetable.\n\n<mark>Juicy Deep Fried Chicken</mark> - this was a little bit unique as it seemed to be chicken that was rolled up, then fried and cut. juicy on the inside and crispy on the outside - no complaints here.\n\n<mark>Yellowtail Carpaccio</mark> - the fish was good here, but the bluefin spoiled me a bit as it didn't seem as special. still, the wasabi and yuzukosho did a nice job of brightening up the yellowtail in this dish.\n\nfish of the day - yellowback seabream - this was one of the fish of the day, served whole. it was a pretty small dish with only about 8 chunks of white flesh. it was very good though, with a crispy exterior from the deep frying.\n\n<mark>Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard</mark> - the custard was silky smooth with a fairly subtle foie gras flavor. very comforting. the piece of duck breast on top was pretty good too.\n\nwe proceeded with a number of robata-grilled dishes.\n\nbutter saut\\u00e9ed scallop with soy sauce - the scallop (served in its shell) was cooked well, but i thought the butter was a little overpowering here.\n\nchicken thigh - this was the first piece where i could really get a sense of the charcoal grill flavor. there was a smoky char on the chicken, and it was moist and flavorful. really simple and really good.\n\nkobe beef filet with wasabi - again, a good smoky flavor from the grill paired with some really flavorful tenderloin. surprisingly juicy and flavorful. i liked the fresh wasabi as well, countering the rich meat. delicious!\n\nkurobuta pork cheek - i was surprised to find this rather chewy, kind of like a chicken gizzard. maybe i just haven't really had cheek in this type of preparation. it was well-marbled, and the porky flavor was present.\n\nkobe beef tendon - not my favorite. i never really like the tendon though, and this was like a big blob of gooey tendon. so meltingly tender, i wasn't sure if i was biting into fat or tendon. i think this was probably a very good preparation, but it's not my thing.\n\nduck with balsamic soy sauce - an interesting dish here - the duck was prepared well, and the balsamic soy and fresh onions did a good job of cutting through some of the richness.\n\napple marinated lamb chop - tender and juicy, this was a damn good lamb chop. i'm not sure if i got any apple flavor though, but i didn't mind.\n\nkobe beef outside skirt with garlic - really good. exceedingly tender and flavorful, with a nice garlic touch.\n\ni had high expectations for raku and i wasn't disappointed. in fact, it exceeded them. after dining at places from joel robuchon and jose andres, it was nice to get something rather simple with clean, familiar flavors. almost like a detox, if you will. the raw fish preparations (ooh the bluefin!) and the robata-grilled items stood out most to me, but it was a well-rounded meal.", 
            "i dined at raku at about 10pm on a tuesday night and really enjoyed my meal.  \n\nthe pitcher of beer came with chilled glasses so that's always a plus.\n\nthe aji sashimi on special was good but i really liked their in house made wasbi and soy sauce.  very yummy!\n\nnext came the fried ebi balls (also a special) and they were like deep fried har gau dumplings.  light and tasty.\n\nthen came the items we ordered from the robata grill - chicken wings, enoki mushrooms wrapped in bacon, and kurobota pork cheeks.  i'm a big robata fan so i loved all 3 of these choices.  the wing in particular was very meaty and so tender and flavorful.\n\nthe best dish of the night was probably the <mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark>.  i even drank up all of the broth it came in!\n\nthe <mark>Juicy Deep Fried Chicken</mark> was also a winning dish.\n\nbut i do have deduct 1 star for service.  one of the older ladies wasn't the friendliest and then they also forgot our grilled musubi order.  when we reminded them about it, it came out way too late.", 
            "it took so many attempts to finally try raku.  one failed reservation and one failed late night arrival (kitchen closed like 10 mins before i got there), later, i finally got a reservation... for 10pm at night.\n\ni was hoping for an early dinner time to party after but honestly, i had to try raku and was not disappointed at all.\n\nevery dish ordered was amazing but there is a list of must-try items:\n\n1. half n half order of the amazing <mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark> and cold house made tofu.  the agedashi broth was delicious and the tofu had the perfect fried coating.  the star of this dish was the cold tofu.  the texture was like panna cotta and melted in your mouth.  combined with the delicious sauces and spice blends on the table... a party in the mouth.\n\n2. <mark>Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard</mark>.  honestly it may sound a little off putting or an interesting dish, but holy crap.  this is a rich dish and not for the faint of heart, but the richness and sweetness of the <mark>Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard</mark> combined with the salty flavor of the foie gras was divine.\n\n3. kobe beef outside skirt with garlic.  kobe is always good and combined with the crispy garlic slice made for a great spicy/rich and crunchy/tender balance of flavor and texture.\n\n4. enoki mushroom wrapped bacon.  take one part bacon and one part mushroom and you have such a delicious dish.  the enoki provides a surprising crunch and the bacon fat singsssssss.  this is a deceptively complex dish exploding with flavor.\n\n5. duck with balsamic soy sauce.  the sauce on this dish is lick-the-plate good.  what else is there to know?\n\nmy only wish is i had multiple stomachs like a cow to consume the entire menu.", 
            "i read a lot of reviews and knew this was a place to visit.  we first tried to visit it last saturday right when they opened at 6pm.  \"no reservation??  sorry -- no openings until after midnight!\"  wow.  i guess that makes sense since there are only about 10 tables in the entire joint.  i felt like a rejected girlfriend.  i needed to get in now.  but with two kids -- what are the chances that my babysitter and an opening at raku align!??!  low and behold -- it was tonight.   we made a reservation for 8:30pm after a networking event.  they were booked up but gave us the counter over the phone.  \n\nwe arrived 30 minutes early hoping we could work our way in.  they sent us to the \"bar\" first.  the bar is just that -- a walnut, natural wood bar.  but there was no bartender or booze there.  you just wait until it's time while propping your elbow up on the walnut.  luckily, we didn't wait long (otherwise, the non-bar \"bar\" would have made me mad!).  plus, we were seated at a real table (not the counter).  usually, i would prefer the counter (a la sushi bar) but this one was just a counter without action to watch.  i think the only main advantage to the counter is to socialize with other diners (which i might add all seem to be really cool, smart people -- a rare find for so many in one location in vegas!).\n\nwe didn't know what to order but took a few recommendations from other yelp reviews.  i can't remember the intricate names of each -- but here's my layman's descriptions of our highlights:\n\n-hot asparagus with crunchy coating (my favorite thing ever.  economical and awesome).\n-blue fin sashimi ( a pricey special at $25 - but some of the best sashimi i've ever had)\n-<mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark> (it really is an amazing, almost dessert-like treat in a savory broth)\n-yellowtail skewers.  i usually think it is a shame to cook yellowtail - but i didn't feel that way this time around.\n-butter scallop - it was okay, but not as special as the other items.\n-green tea creme brulee.  the bomb.  a great finish to the evening.\n\ni thought all of these reviews were hype - i'm happy to say i was wrong.  every moment i spent dining at raku has made me a better person.  i will talk about this experience nonstop to my peers.  if you like japanese food, you need to go here to make yourself a better person.",

            "\"raku haiku\"\n\nroasted iced green tea\nyum fatty deliciousness\nsolo at raku\n\n\"ode to fatty deliciousness and overindulgence\"\n\nmy return to raku took almost 2 years, but it came when i debated going to restaurant week anywhere, trying central at caesars where i was before this, or getting back here finally.  the calling came to me after i saw central's menu and was bored by it.  i drove over and had a bit of an odd time getting a spot at the bar which had 3 empty seats due to a reservation people had later in the night.  finally after standing for awhile, i got seated at the bar.  in the mean time, chef hiro-san came out from the kitchen to say hello - it had been so long but he remembered me again.  i knew i was in good hands on the grill!  the chef behind the counter gave me a free starter salad with shiitakes, bonito flake, and what appeared to be chinese celery or fennel.  i hate celery and it tasted neutral so it probably was fennel :)\n\ni ordered off the specials first (without seeing any prices, woops!) - first, kinae dai sashimi = golden snapper...with house-made pickled ginger shreds.  it was beautifully bright red and tasty, but definitely a lean fish and ironically the most expensive thing i ordered (when i saw the bill later).  it was my only non-fatty item and so great that i tried it as it was fresh that day, but i liked everything else better.\n\nnext came the kushiage tofu special, a new dish.  it is a lightly fried tofu topped with uni and a dashi broth.  when it was presented to me, i was told to stir everything together.  this totally is a dish for me since i love tofu, i love <mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark>, and i love uni.  made for me!\n\nthirdly, my favorite dish of the night - i told my waiter (also from the ka days) that i love fatty fish and he told me they had salmon belly.  i said okay, but how i love hamachi!  he checked and lo and behold, one hamachi belly left!  he hooked it up bigtime!  grilled hamachi belly with crispy skin topped with green onion, shredded daikon on the side, and ponzu dipping sauce (i added togarashi to it mmm!) - this was so off the hook that i almost exclaimed that out loud!  fatty, crispy, soft, salty, citrus-y....need i say more?  i would do this again and again!\n\nafter all of that, i opted for the foie gras don - i didn't even notice the back of the main menu until that and i knew i was rich-dish-mish accomplished (rhyme fo sho) so i was done.  i got a rich glazed serving of foie atop rice and shredded lettuce.  lettuce was a bit odd but i ate up everything because the sauce seeped into the rice.  in the end i was given a cup of hot roasted green tea.\n\nno joke, total indulgence.  but totally worth it.  if i can get back here and not go bankrupt, it will be kushiage tofu and hamachi belly should they have it.  ooooh-mami!", 
            "when you start off knowing that all the major players eat here, you know you're in for a meal of a lifetime. not only does raku serve beautifully executed food, it's a bargain at 10+ courses for only $50pp. the icing on the cake is knowing that you may run into joel robuchon, guy savoy, or even mario batali in his orange crocs. raku is the only place that has managed to \"wow\" me even more on the second visit as compared to the first. and that's not discounting the first meal because that was exquisite in and of itself. however on the second visit, raku was able to re-invent itself and offer even more delectables and a considerably different tasting menu that wowed my palate even more.\n\nthe restaurant is unassuming, located in a strip mall in chinatown. the decor is minimal with two bathrooms with serious personality. the service is unfussy but genuine and you can tell that they take great care in plating and execution without taking it too seriously. the flavors are clean and emphasis is on using only the best ingredients. all of the components of each dish are well thought out and serve a purpose. the results are nothing short of amazing.\n\nmy favorites are as follows:\n*<mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark> - homemade tofu melts in your mouth and the broth is heavenly, literally out of this world!\n*<mark>Juicy Deep Fried Chicken</mark> - amazingly <mark>Juicy Deep Fried Chicken</mark> wrapped in <mark>Juicy Deep Fried Chicken</mark> skin...need i say more...\n*<mark>Crispy Asparagus Okaki</mark> - the crispy fry on the outside of the asparagus adds the perfect crunch and toasted rice flavor to add incredible depth. add some green tea salt to bring out the flavors even more\n*dried tatmi <mark>Dried Tatami Sardine Salad</mark> - ceasar salad kicked up a notch, great briny and cheesy flavor\n*kurobuta pork cheek robata - juicy and great grill flavor from the robata\n*<mark>Fried Ice Fish</mark> - beautifully <mark>Fried Ice Fish</mark> served whole with fish nuggets in again, heavenly broth\n*enoki mushroom wrapped in bacon robata - it's wrapped with bacon...need i say more\n*<mark>Yellowtail Carpaccio</mark> - sashimi was incredibly fresh\n*grape tomatoes robata - so simple but simply delicious...add the green tea salt and you're going to be impressed and want to try to make it at home\n*salmon ikura don - beautifully presented and then served into individual portions. the ikura pops in your mouth to bring the taste of the ocean to the salmon rice.\n*udon noodle with <mark>Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard</mark> soup - the broth as well as the noodles were amazing\n*eel don with gobo - again, served with heavenly broth. the gobo added great depth by bringing a bit of earthy bitterness to balance the salty and sweet.\n*<mark>Crispy Fried Shrimp</mark> - fried little shrimpies, delicious.. \n*sorbet of the season - so simple, a strawberry sorbet with condensed milk. the combination makes the sorbet take on a creamy texture and the fruit flavor packs a good punch to end the meal. the kiwi one was delicious as well \n\n\nthe things i would forgo to save room for the things above:\nchicken thigh robata\nchicken breast wrapped with chicken skin robata\nkobe beef outside skirt with garlic robata\n<mark>Tofu Salad</mark> \"caprese\" with seaweed, tomatoes, and dried fishies", 
            "finally had the opportunity to bust my raku cherry with three friends visiting from out of town, and when you have a group of folks walk in with no appetite from a heavy late lunch and still managed to complete a meal with their taste buds completely blown away, it is clearly a sign of just pure amazing food.  we had a taste of a few items from each section (appetizers, robata grill, and noodles/rice/soups), and can hardly wait to return for more.  i was so inspired that i composed a raku haiku for each of our selections:\n\n\"<mark>Sashimi Salad</mark>\"\nfresh slice of the sea\ndeep-fried onions paired with greens\nperfect start to meal\n\n\"<mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark>\"\nhouse made soybean dream\namazing broth, chili, roe\nten dollars well spent\n\n\"apple marinated lamb chop\"\nsucculent two chops\naromatically juicy\nno shame to gnaw bone\n\n\"soboro don- seasoned ground chicken\"\nquail yolk atop rice\nmix ingredients and share\ncomfort food at its best\n\n\"grilled rice ball\"\ntwo nuggets of art\nfragrant mint countervailed with crunch\ncomplements all meats\n\n\"asparagus\"\ncrispy rice coating\nperfect balance in texture\nveggie laced with crack\n\n\"kobe beef skirt steak\"\nribeye pales to you\nwhere have you been all my life?\nmelt in your mouth joy\n\n\"pork cheek\"\nbacon's lost cousin\ni feel guilty eating this...\nyet i cannot stop", 
            "visited vegas and my friend insisted we eat here.\nhands down, the best japanese food i have had in the us.\n\nwe did not go with the tasting menu but did choose a lot from the daily specials.\nthe fish specials, they will sashimi have the fish and you can grill or fry the remaining. \n\nif you like sea urchin and ikura, you must try the \"<mark>Poached Egg</mark> with sea urchin and salmon roe\" this was a my favorite.\n\nthe raku tofu and <mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark> ( made by them) were simple and delicious.\n\nthis is a grill house so be sure to try the kobe skewer.\n\nthese portions are good for sharing as a couple. everything was light, balanced and not too heavy so you can order different things and get a good tasting.\n\nsave room for the deserts. we tried all of them, favorite was the fluffy cheese cake. and the melting chocolate cake ( it comes out at it should, not like a over cooked piece of brownie that most places serve).", 
            "my wife and kids finally made it up to vegas and we had reservations for an early dinner at raku.  i've heard so many good things about this place so i had to see for myself.  overall we had a good meal an i'd love to come back again.  the <mark>Juicy Deep Fried Chicken</mark> was just that.......juicy.  it was sooo good.  and the skin was very crispy still yet.  <mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark> wad also excellent.  that dash/soy broth was amazing.  the butter sauteed scallop with soy was also amazing as well.  the kobe skirt with garlic was great as well with the perfect amount of garlicky goodness in each bite.  a few dishes didn't quite do it for us though.  the chicken breast wrapped with chicken skin....meh.  the kurobuta pork cheek wad tougher than i had imagined it shouldn't been.  and the grilled rice ball in broth ( we ordered it with salmon) had a touch too much shiso flavor for me.  overall, we enjoyed the meal and will let my parents know about this place for the next time they travel to vegas.", 
            "we love this place!  we were so bummed to miss the saki tasting event. on friday night we took nicole since it was her last night in vegas. we ate at otto earlier and planned on finishing it off big.  we usually order something from the board, but i guess we did it too big at otto.  ha!  anyways, we ordered all over the place (as usual) starting with raku tofu & <mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark>. the tomatoes are a must!  i always order the green chilis & pork cheek too. the scallops were amazing!  we actually did order something from the board - the oysters. these things were huge!  like on steroids huge!  others at my table had them both slightly grilled & fresh, and the presentation was so pretty & impressive.  i skipped the saki this time (they have an extensive saki list), as well as the beer. i over did it. but i am so happy i did!\n\ni didn't give it 5 stars this time because another patron got sick at her table and she stayed there....getting sick. it was very awkward, her friends brought in plastic bags for her to ummm....you know. i don't understand why she wasn't taken to the restroom, outside, or anywhere else?  i felt bad for her. i also felt uncomfortable - no one needs to see that while eating dinner. i have no doubt the staff were uncomfortable as well. how do restaurants handle these types of situations?", 
            "we came here around 9:30 pm on a saturday and the little restaurant was packed full.  \n\nfood: 5 \nthe <mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark> was a little strange - instead of cubes, it was one big patty of tofu.  it wasn't crispy (i usually like my agedashi to be crispy), but the broth was delicious. the ikura don was pretty standard, just ikura over rice, but the quality of the ikura was very good, and there was a lot of it for $10.  the buttered scallops were tasty, but overpriced at $7 per scallop! don't think i'd get those again. the green tea soba had a great flavor and was cooked very al dente, just how i like it.  the skirt steak with fried garlic was probably my favorite.  the meat was tender and cut up bite-sized, the sauce was absolutely scrumptious, and the garlic slices brought out the flavor of the meat.  my family also ordered the chicken wings, the uni/ikura/<mark>Poached Egg</mark> dish, the pork cheek, and the grilled oysters, but i didn't eat any of those, so i can't comment.  however, they all liked those dishes very much.\n\nservice: 4\nour food took a long time to come out, but i understand because it was all so intricately prepared.  the waitresses were helpful, but they could have been more attentive about our water.\n\nambiance: 3\nmy only complaints about this place are that it's very small and cramped, it's a little too dark, and the chairs/benches are hard and uncomfortable.  they were also playing some shamisen music, which is normally fine, but it was really loud.", 
            "we drove to vegas on thursday night and i was yelping on the car looking for a sushi restaurant in vegas. raku was popped up w/ highest rating and late open. we got there at 1:00am and it was only us and another table. this is what we ordered : <mark>Sashimi Salad</mark>, foie gras, grilled kobe beef, tongue, liver, and tendon, home made  <mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark>. the food was so good, fresh and good portion. \n\n i love brown sugar plum wine there.  the waitress was nice enough to bring out the bottle so i could take the pix ( i'm still looking to buy it when i'm back to oc but no sign yet) \n\ni wanted to make the reservation for 10  courses kaiseki meal but it is 3 day advanced reservation.  i definitely would come back for this", 
            "yes it's true, the restaurant has an air of la snob. \n\ndon't even think about walking in without an reservation, it's impossible to get a seat even though a lot of seats may look empty. apparently, there are \"reservations.\" we saw this happen to many people and we also attempted at it once.\n\nwe were 10 minutes early for our reservation but since the restaurant hadn't technically \"opened\" yet, we were made to wait outside in the grimy chinatown sidewalk. which was fine. then we saw 4 international guests walk out of the restaurant fully fed and intoxicated. these guys were probably friends with the chef/owner or were especially special guests because the staff were farewelling them and all this fancy stuff. this was fine too. so we were the only 2 waiting outside and finally the restaurant had opened but we weren't sure if we could enter because the door was still closed and the hostess didn't invite us in. so we waited some more and finally we thought screw it let's go inside. we got in and there was no \"thank you for waiting\" courtesy and the chef was standing around in his undershirt. finally, we got seated and i have to admit i started dinner a little bit aggravated and unsure why i was here. \n\nthe cold service was quickly forgotten as i dove into our first dish (kanpachi), then our second, then our third, fourth, fifth...twelveth. the food was ridiculously delicious -- japanese food taken to another level! the service gets better once you are seated and you order food. the waitress describes and food and is polite.\n\nmy favorite items:\n1. raku's tofu - homemade, best tofu i've ever eaten\n2. <mark>Sashimi Salad</mark> - the dressing is superb\n3. kobe beef outside skirt with garlic - obviously this is going to be awesome!\n4. butter saut\\u00e9ed scallop with soy sauce - i wished i ordered more of this dish. sharing one was simply not enough for me!\n5. daily special: kanpachi - super fresh\n6. daily special: blue crab miso soup - you can actually taste both ingredients.\n\nmaybe will order again:\n1. melting chocolate cake - if i have room, i'd order this again\n2. green tea creme brulee - this one was standard, nothing special\n\nwouldn't order again:\n1. <mark>Poached Egg</mark> with sea urchin and salmon roe - visually and ideally appealing but the texture creeped me out. i thought i was eating really flavorful phlegm. \n2. <mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark> - raku's tofu was better because the simple ingredients enhanced the tofu. the agedashi was a bit overpowered by sauce. \n3. oyako don chicken and egg - i don't think it's a dish you should order at a restaurant like this\n4. oyster isobeyaki - the way it was grilled made the oyster way too chewy for my taste. and, i didn't like the crispy seaweed accompanying it. \n\nalso, if you have time check out my photos of all the things we ate!", 
            "another excellent time at raku. everything, including the service, is excellent. however, my only complaint about raku occurs before you even get there...\n\nthe reservation process at raku needs help. i understand this is a hot place, but i fail to understand the restriction on placing reservations only between 1400 and 1700 hours, then not answering the phone at all after 1700 hours. the voice mail message also says no reservations by message or email, and there is no web-based system like open table here either. worse, the person taking the reservation wants all my personal info, and repeatedly warns me that there are other reservations and i have to be out by a certain time. this is dangerously close to serious pretentious snooty-ville, and i am hoping and praying that raku does not fall victim to its own success and get too arrogant for its own good. customer service first please. i realize american restaurants like to flip tables as fast as possible, but telling a customer to leave by a certain time is highly rude. worse, i heard this said to a few other customers while i was there in-person. wow.\n\ni happened to be out of the country, and i stayed up until midnight just to make the call at raku during their limited reservation window. yeah, i'm a little miffed at this and maybe being too much of a whiner, but all is forgiven because...\n\nall that being said, the food and service here is consistently stellar, and i will put up with this level of reservation combativeness as long as it doesn't get any worse. \n\nbtw, for all that reservation work, the place was 75% empty and remained so while we were there from 1830 to 2000 on a thursday night. wtf?\n\nmy review remains: highly recommended\n\n(sake flight, asahi draft, two white pear martinis, two <mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark>, <mark>Crispy Fried Shrimp</mark>, kobe liver, pork ear, beef tendon, boiled egg, sunomono: $85)", 
            "the last time i went with jin n. and mira a., and we couldn't stop talking about the kurobuta pork cheek and the <mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark>. i also tried the raw beef liver with garlic for the first time and it was surprisingly good. \n\nthe green tea soba noodles and the salmon rice kamameshi were great too (off menu), but too much carbs. i'd rather stick to the awesome proteins here.", 
            "my wife and i began our 10 year anniversary weekend with visit to raku as we drove into vegas at 1:45 am on friday night (saturday morning, actually).  fortunately for us, the kitchen was making its last call and we still had time to order.\n\nbest dishes:\n<mark>Poached Egg</mark> with sea urchin (salmon roe, jalapeno, mushrooms, mountain root in soba broth served cold) - amazing well constructed with a perfectly <mark>Poached Egg</mark> and various layers of flavor that all worked together.  a bargain at $9.\nfoie gras chawanmushi (<mark>Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard</mark> with a hint of foie gras, smoked duck and black truffle) - creamy, rich, delicious!  $10\n<mark>Juicy Deep Fried Chicken</mark> (six medallions of chicken, fried, over a bed of baby spinach) - we weren't going to order this, but our waitress highly recommended it, and we're glad she did. $9\nenoki mushroom with bacon - great flavor from the grill and a thick, lean, juicy cut of bacon. $2.80 for two.\nkamo grilled duck (with balsamic soy sauce) - tender, well seasoned, and not gamey at all.\n\ngood dishes:  <mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark>, momo chicken thigh, grilled veal\n\ndisappointing:  kobe beef with wasabi (surprisingly ordinary), tontoro kurobuta pork cheek (too fatty for our taste), <mark>Sashimi Salad</mark> (expected more from raku)\n\nregarding some topics raised by other reviewers:\nprice.  we thought the prices were quite reasonable for a restaurant of this quality.\nservice.  for the most part, the wait staff was pleasant and informative.  they were not very attentive - we did have to ask for refills, etc.  but, because the restaurant was small and not crowded, it was fairly easy to get their attention.\n\noverall, this was a great meal and a fantastic way to start our 10th anniversary weekend.", 
            "so there we were, our first night in for the weekend in vegas and starving. we headed to chinatown from the rio, reluctant as i've always been the typical tourist that is attached to the strip like a naked stripper is on me, but obviously my reluctance was misplaced. after being ripped off by a local cabby, we found ourselves at an asian inspired strip mall. every store front was either japanese or chinese and in the corner was raku, our destination for the evening.\n\n\nthe restaurant, with its low ambient lighting and small room was very intimate. the customary japanese greeting was very much appreciated and we were seated at a well sized table right across from the sushi bar. the server came over, took our drinks and in broken english tried to explain the specials. it is a good thing that most were written on a chalk board that she brought to the table, although it didn't help much that all that was written was the english phonetic spellings of the japanese name of the dish.\n\n\nwe settled on order a variety of tapas that were quite delicious and although i don't remember exactly what the japanese names were, you'll easily be able to find them on the menu should you decide to head there and try it yourself. i've decided to only mention a few that really stuck out in my mind that i think is a must have when dining there. i wish that i had more time and a larger stomach to try more choices, but that may have to wait until the next visit.\n\nwe had an order of the <mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark> which was superb. a must try. it was well seasoned and beyond comparison to what i would find back home in calgary and might i even say, vancouver. along side was the hot version of their tofu, also well accept in my mouth and i think a worthwhile try.\n\n\nthe blue fin tuna was exquisite. a rare food item here in canada, it was a sashimi that could not be refused. priced at almost around $20 it was an expensive but delicious treat to try this not so common fish. presentation was fantastic and only added to the appeal. on the plate were these salted seaweed pieces that added just the right amount of compliment to bring out the flavours.\n\n\nthe tsukune was a make shift chicken drum stick. it is pretty much ground up chicken with spices added and then re-pressed on to a tongue-depressor like stick. surprisingly quite delicious even though it reminded me of eating a corn dog at the local fair but with a presentation made for a connoisseur of corn dogs.\n\n\nlastly, my favourite item of all, the kobe beef tendon. words can not describe the best tendon that i've ever had any where. for those of you who are not a huge fan of soft squishiness in your mouth, i would avoid this dish, but for those of you who can appreciate tendon this is a must have and if anything, the one and only reason to visit raku a second time. the most tender and well proportioned piece of tendon skewered and grilled. the flavour was perfect with a hint of the grill and simply melted in your mouth. i highly recommend this.\n\n\nthe overall cost of the visit was just over a hundred for two of us including two beers and about 6 tapas. this is a great place and despite being off the strip and in a bit of a shady neighbourhood (which i'm sure it wasn't, it was just my impression) i would definitely recommend a visit. compared to the strip and its similar offerings, raku beats them all out by far.\n\nreservation recommended.", 
            "i am in love with this place.  i am jealous of everyone who is going to vegas or will be going to vegas since they have the opportunity to eat at raku while i'm at home, reminiscing my memories of how fabulous this meal was and how i would like to go again.  \n\nwe ordered a variety of dishes - each being very delicious and mouthwatering.  the stand out dishes we had that night would be:\n\n1)  oden - oh how subtle yet so flavorful the broth is.  i loved being able to customize what goes inside the oden.  \n2)  foie gras with glazed soy-base sauce - i typically don't like foie gras but the soy sauce glaze and the grill made the meat so flavorful and very delicious way.  so good.\n3)  <mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark> - the tofu was freshly made and just melted in your mouth.  \n\nthough truthfully, everything that we ordered was so amazing.  the one dish i really wanted to try but they ran out of was the <mark>Poached Egg</mark> with sea urchin and salmon roe.  i'm hoping to get that the next time i'm in vegas!", 
            "we love robata grill, so raku seemed a must visit on our latest trip to las vegas.  \n\nfirst, the service at raku was slow.  not just slow, but mind-numbingly slow.  our meal lasted three hours, including an inexplicable half hour delay between the first appetizer of fresh tofu and our next course of blue fin tuna sashimi.  since this was our first visit, i'm not ready to pass judgment.  but in any case, i probably wouldn't recommend you visit raku if you are on a tight timeline.  but if you are going to provide slow service, you better make sure it is good -- and raku came through.  although she steered us to the \"safer\" menu items, our server was friendly, helpful, and, when she was around, attentive.  when she wasn't, we were on our own for large stretches of time, or offered the wrong dish by one of the other servers who consistently confused our table.\n\nhowever, the food overwhelmed any service issues.  it was, in a word, amazing!  we started with the fresh tofu -- it had the consistency of ricotta but what drove it to the next level were the myriad layers of flavor added by the various condiments.  although i never thought i would say it about a \"plain\" tofu dish, this is a must have.\n\nthe blue fish tuna sashimi special was also very good.  it was fresh and delicious but while we enjoyed it, it probably wasn't even close to the level of the tofu.  combine that with the near extinction of blue fin tuna and the price, and it probably won't be on our next order.  same with the sea snail, which was interesting, but not especially flavorful.  and while we are big fans of eel, the unagi teriyaki was not as good as the ones available at other restaurants.\n\nthe fried flying fish and <mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark> reinvigorated our meal.  both were excellent. and the accompanying broth was delicious to the last drop.  it typified our experience at raku, where the multiple layers of texture and flavor combine to create a large complex symphony.  \n\nthe grilled skewers were also great.  the tomato with bacon and enoki mushroom with bacon were exactly why we love robata grill.  the only other vegetable we ordered, the <mark>Crispy Asparagus Okaki</mark>  was also excellent.  the beef outside skirt with garlic was good, the duck with balsamic soy sauce was better, and the foie gras with glazed soy-base sauce was absolutely, melt-in-your-mouth amazing.  the pork cheek was also good, but the pork ear was a little bit to chewy and cartilaginous to be our cup of tea.  surprisingly, the tsukune-grilled ground chicken was bland -- a let down compared to the rest of the meal.\n\nwe finished off with the green tea creme brulee, which was the perfect dessert.  not too rich or thick, it was exactly what we needed after the rich skewers we had just eaten.  and it had the same depth of flavors that we had enjoyed in the other dishes.  i also recommend you try the sake flight.  it was interesting and all of the sakes were excellent -- you can order most of them by the glass, as well as by the bottle, if you find one that you like.\n\noverall, raku was a great, if lengthy experience.  we will try the kaiseki meal (and make sure we have a four hours to spare) the next time we visit.", 
            "where do i start? should i begin with the atmosphere, the warm service, or the delicious food? ...because that's all that you get here. and it's such a good combination.\n\nthe meal started with their <mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark>, which was then split into two halves--the original <mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark> (hot) and cold tofu traditionally served with their green tea salt, homemade soy sauce, and ginger, as per our waitress' recommendation. i loved the <mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark> (the warm, sweet sauce it sits in--yum!) but i thought the cold tofu tasted better and was so much more enjoyable to eat, what with being able to sprinkle green tea sea salt and garnish it with seaweed and stuff. nonetheless, solid appetizer either way, definitely recommend!\n\nour list of the other selects: iberico pork, enoki mushroom wrapped with bacon, asparagus wrapped with bacon, kobe beef outside skirt with garlic, duck with balsamic soy sauce, butter saut\\u00e9ed scallop with soy sauce, and tsukune (grilled, ground chicken). everything tasted delicious, but the ones that stood out were:\n\n-iberico pork: holy cow, you have to ask yourself and really think hard: how can pork belly get any better? right? pork belly anything anywhere is delicious... but this one, from spain, organic pork belly... i don't know man, it's wondrous. juicy, tender, just the right amount of fat and meat. careful, though, it's $10 a skewer and we ordered four without knowing!\n\n-enoki mushroom with bacon: again, another solid dish you can find anywhere, but the bacon has such a smokey flavor that it brings out the best of enoki and makes it better than the ones you've tried anywhere else. a must order.\n\n-butter saut\\u00e9ed scallop: my favorite!! ugh, i die. sauteed to perfection~ with just enough \"raw-ness\" in the center... doused and double doused, probably, in that insanely mouthwatering-but-not-overwhelming garlic butter sauce. one order (two pieces of scallop) = $7. pricey, but worth it, i think...\n\n-duck with balsamic soy sauce: a really good dish, even for non-duck lovers. tender, juicy, flavorful. balsamic soy sauce adds a nice dimension to it. recommended!", 
            "i am fully aware of how yelpers in general have an unconditional and unwavering love for this place, just like i'm very aware of the \"yelpers love us\" sticker on the door. the reviews were one of the reasons we decided to come to this place, however, its also one of the few times that i have disagreed with the raving reviews of yelp.\n\nwe came here about 1 am on a wednesday morning and even though there were open seats, they still felt that we should wait before being seated. 10 minutes later, we were seated at one of the open seats.\n\nfrom the onset, the service was a bit slow. our server asked if we were ready to order right away, but we asked for a minute. it was only after about 15 minutes of waiting we decided to flag our server to order. the food also came slowly but that wasn't really the issue.\n\nso down to the food. we ordered:\n\n1) aohata nabe: this was basically a fish stew. this was 40 dollars and my least favorite item that we ordered. it wasn't bad, but it wasn't particularly good either.\n\n2) <mark>Tofu Salad</mark>: this simple item was probably one of my favorites. it's 7 dollars and pretty flavorful with their green tea salt.\n\n3) <mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark>: i know that this item is all that yelpers rave about, and it was good, but cooome on... its not that good! 10 dollars. actually, i thought it was just \"ok.\"\n\n4) <mark>Crispy Asparagus Okaki</mark>. this was actually really good. it tasted like asparagus with japanese cracker crumbs. 5 dollars.\n\n5) <mark>Juicy Deep Fried Chicken</mark>: simple <mark>Juicy Deep Fried Chicken</mark> served much like a sushi roll. these tasted great. 9 dollars.\n\n6) tsukune: the ground chicken was my 2nd least favorite. just very ehh. $3.50.\n\n7) enoki mushroom w/ bacon: this was probably my favorite item of the night, simple yet very tasty. $2.80.\n\n8) scallop w/ soy sauce: the scallop was amazing, especially with the sauce that it comes in. loved this. 7 dollars.\n\nwe tried to order the pork belly but they were out.\n\nall in all, perhaps because of the raving reviews, this place was a slight disappointment. from the slow service to the aohata nabe, things were just a bit off with the whole experience. \n\nthe food, in general, is good, but its not that good. this experience reminds the moment when walking out of the movie theaters after watching hunger games. overrated. i'm saying this as a person that loves japanese food (and i'm not talking about california rolls as japanese food), but real authentic japanese food.\n\nif you're in the mood for tasty no-frills chinese/malaysian food at about 1/6 of the price, go to big wong, only a few feet away from raku.", 
            "no question, this is a 5 star establishment. i seriously have hated tofu most my life, but the <mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark> was probably the best thing i ate in the city of las vegas over a 3 day stay. so amazing. i'd suggest coming with friends and sampling the menu like we did, gives you the opportunity to try more of the amazing menu items. \n\ni'll likely be back for a second visit in less than a week and i live 5 hours away, its that good", 
            "seriously good  japanese comfort food (robata grill) combined with outstanding artistry.\n\nfor starters, <mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark>.  sublime; fried house made tofu bathed in a heavenly flavored dashi base topped with briny salmon roe.\n\nfrom the robata grill, kurobuta pork cheeks (face, not butt, sweet porky goodness),  enoki mushrooms wrapped in bacon (smoky richness), \"kobe\" fillet with wasabi (tender, wasabi brings out a mineral earthiness and sweetness), \"kobe\" skirt with garlic (razor thin slivers of garlic mixes with melting beef fat), and if they have it, teriyaki foie (orgasmic flavor explosion that goes on and on).\n\nfinally, the kaiseki meals are incredible.  they feature small portions of the best of the robata grill mixed with delicacies not offered anywhere else on the menu.  some of the dishes are out there.  one night offered sea snails another foie chawanmushi.  both surprisingly delicious.  keep an open mind.  the progression of courses in flavors, textures, and temperature is well thought out.  well worth the $100 or $150.  \n\nnote:  three day advance reservations required for the kaiseki and all members of your group need to order it.\n\ntip:  always ask if there are any off the menu specials.  depending on how much they \"like\" you, you may be in for a real treat (sorry, it's an asian thing).\n\ngood selection of sake at all quality and price levels. \n\nneedless to say, highly recommended.", 
            "i ate at raku at the recommendation of my friend ryan.  raku is located off spring mountain road in chinatown. let me start by saying that this place has amazing food. we arrived promptly at around midnight but didnt actually get seated til about 12:30am or so.  it would have been five stars had their service been better. \n\nwe started with a salad of some sort, which was fresh and marinaded and was delightful.  we then had the iberico carpaccio, which had the iberico with a layer of gelatinous fat on top and melts away when you eat it.  it was one of the highlights of the night. it was a special so when we tried to order it again later that night, it was sold out. \nthe <mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark> was delicious. soft tofu with a good broth that provides the tofy with alot of flavor.  <mark>Poached Egg</mark> with sea urchin was a hit, it includes <mark>Poached Egg</mark>, sea urchin, okra, mushrooms, salmon roe, in a broth. kobe beef filet was tender and the wasabi touch was the right amount of spice to the kobe beef. the chicken teba wing had a good crust and was tender and flavorful.  the toro tataki was soft and buttery and was fantastic but we had gotten the last order.  the pork cheek was fatty and full of flavor.  the negitoro was ok and didnt blow me away like most of the other dishes.  <mark>Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard</mark> was excellent.", 
            "so very wonderful. raku was unlike any japanese i'd had and i loved everything about this place. \n\nwe had 8:30 reservations on a sunday night and watched them have to turn people away without reservations or tell them that the wait was around 2 hours. so i would definitely get a reservation because the place is so small and popular. it is in a strip mall in chinatown but once you get in it is lovely. great atmosphere with super sweet staff saying things to you in japanese when you enter and exit while you just smile and nod like you know what just happened. i also like the touch of the chopsticks resting on little chunks of charcoal on the tables. staff was super helpful with our order and checked to make sure every dish was to our liking.\n\nso we started with the grilled cherry tomatoes which sounds pretty basic but was fantastic. they were so smoky and salty. seriously good. we also got the crispy asparagus which had maybe a panko crust. also fantastic was a grilled squid from the specials board, miso soup, and grilled rice balls. the table favorites were the <mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark> and butter seared scallop. the flavor on both was just amazing.\n\nit was a really great, unique place and fantastic dining experience. everything was well done with great attention to detail. if you have the chance go to this place.", 
            "this place was one of the better places we had the opportunity to enjoy during our vegas trip (although i almost killed myself when i leaned on what i thought was the hostess stand and almost busted my behind).\n\nthe waitstaff was pleasant, friendly, and very helpful.  one of them went through the entire specials board and explained each and every dish, which was really nice.\n\nwe ordered the following:\n\n<mark>Poached Egg</mark> with uni and salmon roe\ntoday's ohitashi\n<mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark>\ntsukune skewer\nkobe beef skirt with garlic skewer\nkobe beef tendon skewer\nkurobuta pork cheek skewer\npork ear\napple marinated lamb chop \nsaikyoyaki special\nveal skewer special\nmelting chocolate cake\nfluffy cheesecake\n\nmy bf could not bring himself to try the egg with uni and salmon roe only because of the slimey texture of it all, but he did try everything else (i loved the dish by the way).  we loved everything  except for the kobe beef tendon...a little too fatty, rich, mushy, sticky for our taste.  everything else was yum-o!\n\nthis place is a short cab ride from the vegas strip and the waitress will call a cab for you when you're finished with your meal...now that's service.  we would defitnitely go back!  i'm so glad i found the izakaya in vegas......i thought i can only have it in nyc!", 
            "following other postings, i made my reservations plenty early (10 days ahead).  service was good.  they did take the time to explain the whole specials menu from which we picked 3-4 items and the rest from the regular menu.  surprisingly, some of the simpliest dishes were the best including bacon wrapped tamatoes and mushrooms.  i had the <mark>Poached Egg</mark> with ikura and uni just to try something on the expensive side.  good but not much more spetacular than what you'd expect from such ingredients.  the stars of the night was the lamb chops, kurobota pork cheeks, and <mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark>...in that order.  everything else was still good but i may come back next time and get nothing but lamb chops.    will definitely go again as there were plenty on the menu still to be tried.", 
            "wish we could visit here more often....we spend too much money when we do though because everything is good....\n\nsalmon kamameshi is a must have!!! i believe that even thouse who do not enjoy salmon can enjoy salmon kamameshi.  foie gras is distinctly japanese and very well done. house made <mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark> melts in your month. you can tell their dashi and house made tofu are very good. \n\nthis is not the place to go if you are in the hurry or if you are looking for a standard american-japanese restaurant. \n\neverything about this restaurant is wonderful except a not-so-friendly manager lady. i try to ignore the fact but it annoys me sometimes.", 
            "when the lights go out on the strip, where do the chefs and restaurant staff go to eat?\n\nraku! \n\nwell what can i say? obviously, people working in the restaurant industry have very good and discerning taste. \n\nif you come to raku expecting to eat maki rolls, you will be disappointed. japanese cuisine is so much more beyond maki rolls. no, japanese don't eat sushi everyday.\n\nraku has many items as part of the daily special that are written on a portable blackboard. our server brought the board to our table and went through each of them. we ended up ordering many items from the specials because they were too good to pass up on.\n\nhighlights from the specials:\n\n*seigo (japanese sea bass)*\nchoose 2 out of 3 methods of preparation: sashimi, grilled, fried.\nthe order is for a whole fish. based on our chosen method of sashimi and grilled, half of it was delicately sliced into sashimi. the other half was grilled to perfection (head and tail included)\n\n*bai gai (japanese sea snail)*\nsuch beautiful snail shells! our server told us that the snails are first cooked for 7-8 hrs until tender and then they are steamed to order.\n\n*kushi (kobe beef tongue)*\nsmall pieces came on a yakitori stick. drizzled with intensely flavorful sauce.\n\n*kakuni (pork belly)*\nbraised until very tender. we ate up both meat and fat without guilt.\n\nitems we ordered from the regular menu which were equally amazing:\n\n*raku tofu*\nthis is their signature housemade tofu. our server told us that raku makes their tofu fresh everyday. the tofu was unlike any other we've had. the texture was extremely creamy. it is meant to be sprinkled with some green tea salt made with mushroom <mark>Sunomono - Cucumber And Seaweed</mark>. and then enjoyed with soy sauce, scallions, and bonito flakes.\n\n*<mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark>*\nalso uses the housemade tofu, slightly fried on the outside, and served with dashi sauce, roe, tiny mushrooms, and japanese chilli paste on the side.\n\n*<mark>Juicy Deep Fried Chicken</mark>*\nthis is similar to karaage (<mark>Juicy Deep Fried Chicken</mark> cutlets). the chicken was unbelievably moist and it was fried until it just crossed over from rare to cooked. i don't know how the chefs timed it that well, but it sure prevented an overcooked and dry meat.\n\n*oden (fish cakes)*\nwe selected several types of fish cakes that were served in dashi broth. other items we chose were daikon and pork intestines. oden is especially popular in winter in japan.\n\nif you're visiting vegas and have no access to a car like us, we hopped into a cab from our hotel and raku is just a short ride away. we called for a cab after we were done with dinner. no hassle. make reservations!", 
            "i always get the beef tendon, uni with ikura, foie and rice bowl, and anything different from the chalkboard specials that the server goes over at the table.the <mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark> is a must as well!", 
            "just the fact that we dropped in at 10pm on a whim and the fact that they were able to seat us within the next 5 minutes were certainly deserving of star in its own. \n\nwe are no strangers to this type of cuisine, so we were excited to see if the hype surrounding raku is legit. ordered a little bit of everything: <mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark>, kobe beef liver, pork cheek, pork ear, duck w/ balsamic soy sauce, foie gras w/ soy sauce, buttered scallop w/ soy sauce, sea urchin w/ seaweed soup, and a couple of their sashimi specials. everything was delicious and well-presented! \n\ntiming was a little bit off and the service kind of dwindled down. it was going great at the beginning, but there was a bit of a wait for the rest of our orders, then they all came at the same time. we didn't really care at the time, but for me, it's all about the details. also, i thought the specials, while certainly fresh and top quality, were still a tad expensive compared to what i had in the past. next time, we'll probably stick to the menu and save my sashimi cravings when i'm in kabuto.", 
            "one star off for the service. the group next to mine had the waitress at there table 4 times for every time they came to ours. granted they were busy but i get the feeling that they are always busy. \n\ni want to take a half star off because of the price being a bit much for some of the items. beware of the specialty items they are not given prices unless you ask and they can be surprising when you see the bill. \n\nall that being said the food is good. the bluefin toro was fresh and well portioned. the scallops were awesome and so was the foie gras. i wish i could just order anything on their menu with the fois gras spread on it. :) \n\nthe green tea brulee was ok nothing extraordinary. \n\nthe saki list is amazing and has a good variety of prices to it. \n\noh and the <mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark> is a must! it takes awhile to prepare but well worth it!", 
            "raku broke through the glass ceiling of my expectations of what a great meal is in las vegas. my companion and i made reservations on a saturday night and there were no open ones until 9:30 - i would recommend reservations early as the waitress said that she couldn't see any open seats when we called at 6. \n\nupon walking in we were told to sit at some high chairs near the back while we waited for a table to be cleared. we examined the room, noting the cleanliness and deliberateness of the space and after a minute or two were taken to a table. \n\nwith some cash to blow and empty stomachs to fill we began to pick out some things on the menu that instantly caught our eye - <mark>Sashimi Salad</mark>, yellow-tail carpaccio, <mark>Juicy Deep Fried Chicken</mark>, a miso soup (i always have to order one), kobe beef skirt with garlic, scallop with soy sauce, duck with balsamic soy sauce, and mushrooms to start off the night.\n\nthe food came out in a more logical way than we ordered it. first, the <mark>Sashimi Salad</mark> was insanely good! the fish, greens and dressing complimented each other very well giving us a balanced start to our meal. the yellow-tail carpaccio came out as we were finishing the salad; the yellow-tail was fresh, had amazing texture and simply was astounding. the <mark>Juicy Deep Fried Chicken</mark> was very rich - i had a hard time eating more than one (although my companion easily scarfed down the rest of them!). despite my love for miso soup i find that they never vary between restaurants too much - raku's soup will be noted in having tiny, whole mushroom and large chunks of tofu. kobe beef skirt with garlic was tender and juicy with a great flavor. my companion really loved the duck; i found it quite tasty as well. the mushrooms made a great appearence by breaking up the flow of all the meat/fish dishes we had been having. \n\nand then there was the scallop. oh man, that scallop was revolutionary. the waitress dropped off the scallop served inside of the shell with soy sauce on top; my companion and i split it and were amazed at the light sweetness, the soft texture and the overall quality of the dish. \n\nwe were full. and then we noticed - the menu contains a few items with a red symbol next to them. i asked the waitress what that meant and she explained those were the specialties of raku. specialties? and we hadn't tried the restaurant's specialties? despite our full stomachs we continued onward to order <mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark> and tsukene ground chicken. we agreed both far exceeded our expectations - i had never tried tofu that has been prepared better and i could eat the ground chicken every day for the rest of my life (a guy can dream, right?). \n\nand then the finisher, the end, the encore of the concert, the final chapter in a book, the last mile of the marathon - dessert. green tea creme brulee with green tea ice cream on top. our stomachs were exploding before we got this, we devoured the whole thing and deliberated very seriously on getting another one. we decided against it only because we had reached stomach capacity. \n\nthe food can be costly if you order a lot. however, the experience was well worth the $76.80 subtotal for two people tasting that much food. \n\namazing atmosphere, quality ingredients, fantastic company (your mileage may vary), professionally prepared and plated with great service - everything that anyone wants in a dining experience. \n\nhave you noticed how much i loved this place? i'm having a hard time even explaining - it's like having an adrenaline rush and remembering how fun, exciting, interesting and amazing the experience was wihtout having any more words to share with others than \"try it yourself.\" you will be super happy that you did and have an awesome time.", 
            "i've been wanting to eat here for a couple years now. this past wednesday i invited angela to come with me.\n\ni called the night before and made a reservation for 1900. i asked for the omikase menu and was told they have a $75 and a $100 (per person) menu. people actually opt for the $75? seriously, if you're going to go out and eat and do something like this, go all out.\n\nso i chose the $100. it's a 10 course meal. i asked if that was enough food and she assured me it would be. \n\nwe came early, about 20 minutes early but they had a table for us. we got one of their private booths which i'm guessing we only got it because we came early. \n\noh yeah, i possibly should have started this review with saying that this place might be the best japanese restaurant i have ever, ever been to.\n\ni honestly don't remember every single meal we got but it was all amazing. i'll list them and discuss what i thought was the best thing.\n\nwe were given grilled cherry tomatoes, four different types of sashimi, grilled kobe beef, grilled pork, homemade cold tofu, <mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark> in broth, green tea creme brule, cheese cake and a hot pot with kobe beef in a red bean broth. the last thing was our 11th course as we still wanted another dish after the 10 though honestly, i think we were good and full after the 10 but the food was so good we wanted to try one more dish.\n\na lot of their food comes from organic farms. this is important because the best thing we had was our grilled pork. it's prepared, medium. yep, not fully cooked. the waitress told us the pigs are only fed acorns. it. was. god-like. i couldn't believe pork could taste so good especially cooked medium. way better than even the kobe beef. the homemade tofu, crazy good. crazy good. the condiments on the table are even amazing. they make their own soy sauce and it's the best soy sauce i've ever had. they have some kind of wasabi salt. i've never even heard of such a thing. outstanding. our last dish, the hot pot, they gave us two raw eggs. i'm thinking that we're going to crack these eggs into the broth. totally wrong. we're told to crack the eggs into our bowls, scramble it, and then use it as dipping sauce for the food that comes out of the hot pot! again, the eggs are organic. taste was amazing. and made complete sense as the broth is really sweet, remember it's red bean based so the raw egg totally balances the taste. so awesome. seriously, so awesome. and i mean all the food we had was so awesome. actually, it's awesome. if i could, i'd eat here every week. well, i promised myself that next time i come here i'll either omikase at the sushi bar or i'll do the kaiseki which you need to make a reservation 3 days in advance for! did i mention the word awesome?", 
            "this is the place to go when in vegas! it's even open super late! but drunk bar hoppers please stay away from this zen gem! \n it's great to actually find a restaurant that takes pride in its' food and service, since there is so much flashiness and high priced menus nearby on the strip.\n\nthe specials each night are very interesting and well worth the taste... make sure you check the prices. some items are out of the normal price range. \n\n<mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark> is a must to end the meal. warm, comforting, a bit of crisp, and incredibly fresh.\n\nthe <mark>Poached Egg</mark>, sea urchin, and salmon roe is a small dish, but huge in flavor! very rich; this dish filled me up quickly and was surprisingly very satisfying (especially because westerners are not use to slimy textures... get over it!!).\n\n<mark>Yellowtail Carpaccio</mark> was stunningly beautiful; the fish is so rich in color and flavor. \n\nbasically everything we had was very fresh, tasty, and prepared with care.\n\nservice was spot on. sushi chefs are very nice when sitting at the bar, and are very good and thoroughly explaining the unique dishes that come.  servers refresh plates often, and provide hand towels after eating the sticky kama. friday night they were a little more behind on service; i'd recommend the calm weekdays for perfect service... however, they are better than most restaurants. \n\nthey end with a little toasty tea. i love that little touch!", 
            "this little plaza off the strip is a real gem.  we came to this plaza twice during our trip and also hit up kabuto for sushi.  check out my review here: \n\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz/kabuto-las-vegas#hrid:amqnghz303ggdnb2u9fg_q\n\nafter this trip, i'm really going to focus on finding great restaurants off the strip since there are so many great restaurants at much more reasonable prices off the strip.\n\nraku is a fancy take on a traditional izakaya and is some of the best representation of the genre that i've had.  service was attentive, even though it took a little bit for them to warm up and get our orders going.  \n\nwe shared a number of dishes and that's really the only way to eat at a place like this.  order a bunch of small plates and robata yaki items and just indulge.  some of the highlights for me in no particular order were:\n\n- housemade tofu (both cold and <mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark> styles)\n- pork cheek skewer (a great alternative to the typical pork belly as this has more of an even marbling making)\n\n- sukiyaki with australian a5 wagyu  (there was only 3 ounces of the wagyu and that is really all was needed.  the slices were served cooking gently in the pot and were ready to eat within seconds.  with the fat content of the a5, it really doesn't hurt to have it just cooked through because you do want that fat to melt in your mouth.  normally i would never let my beef slices get past a pink/medium.)\n\n- foie skewer with soy glaze (the glaze was a bit too much for my taste, but coming from california, i'll take all the foie i can get)\n\na couple of items weren't as exciting, but that is what makes the small plates format of an izakaya so nice because you are bound to find something you like.  the tsukune and <mark>Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard</mark> were a bit disappointing.  the tsukune definitely lacked flavor, but was very tender considering it was pure ground white meat chicken.  i will judge all tsukune by those served by shinsengumi in la and this was definitely a cut below.  the <mark>Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard</mark> sounded like it should be a hit, but sadly lacked foie flavor and wasn't as delicate as most good chawanmushis.\n\nall in all, this is definitely a recommended detour from the strip.  you aren't going to get food like this at a reasonable price on the strip.  be sure to make reservations well ahead and get yourself out here.", 
            "amazing restaurant! everything was fresh and unique.  i was impressed by everything on their menu.  first of all, since it's been almost a year since foie gras was banned in california, of course that jumped off their menu, and was the first thing that i wanted to order.  but there were so many other mouth watering dishes!  good thing there were 4 of us in our group, so we could order practically everything!\n\ndefinitely check out their daily specials.  there's going to be something terrific on there.  the day i went, we ordered:\n- grilled alaskan king crab\n- uni udon - a must have if you like uni!!!!!!\n- blue fin tuna sashimi\n\nitems on their regular menu that we had:\n- <mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark>: fresh tofu, and served in a whole block\n- <mark>Sashimi Salad</mark>: ridiculously fresh sashimi!\n- <mark>Yellowtail Carpaccio</mark>\n- <mark>Poached Egg</mark> with uni and salmon roe\n- <mark>Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard</mark>\n- kobe beef fillet with wasabi: we had to order this with all of the reviews that mentioned it, but it didn't live up to the hype. :( good but not phenomenal.\n- kurobata pork cheek : a must order!\n- duck with balsamic soy sauce: very tasty!\n- butter sauteed scallop with soy sauce\n- enoki mushroom wrapped with bacon\n- japanese shishito peppers\n\nto finish off an amazing meal, we had to have dessert.  the green tea creme brulee was the perfect way to end the meal!\n\ni never knew about raku before, but i am raving about it now.  i won't be able to take a vegas trip without stopping by, now.", 
            "it's taken me a long time to getting around to this review, but i needed to dedicate time to properly raving about this wonderful meal. i visited on 04/11/2013 with my fiance ruben and our cousin daisy (visiting from the bay area). we were sat in a private dining area and it was so cool and intimate. i was really glad i made that reservation a couple months in advance!\n\nwe tried the raku's tofu: housemade tofu that was super silky served with fresh grated ginger, green onions, and katsuoboshi. then topped with some of raku's soy sauce (japanese daijingo soy sauce blended with japanese plum). simple and tasty. also, the <mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark>: their housemade tofu lightly fried and presented in a bowl of warm dashi broth and topped with green onions, ikura, and nori. and for an extra kick, some hot chili paste placed on the rim of your bowl. really, really great. i'm a big fan of tofu so i could be happy eating raku's tofu all night, but this <mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark> is a party of flavors in your mouth.\n\nwe also tried the tempura asparagus, kanpachi sashimi (special), blue fin tuna sashimi (special), salmon with ikura oroshi, enoki mushroom wrapped in bacon, direct-flamed eggplant (served with katsuoboshi), duck with balsamic soy sauce, kobe beef filet with wasabi, apple marinated lamb chop, grilled rice balls, yellowtail with glazed soy-based sauce, and <mark>Juicy Deep Fried Chicken</mark>. their yuzu sake is really delicious.\n\nmy favorites were the tofu dishes, the sashimi specials, enoki mushroom with bacon (this was so good, we ordered it twice), and apple marinated lamp chop (we ordered two of these as well).\n\nour meal was spectacular. we had so much fun with all the dishes and the service was wonderful. there are so many selections and everything was, at the least exciting, and at the best, amazing. i would compare the experience to enjoying tapas with great friends. same idea with sharing small plates and that's just always a blast in my book. the food was wonderful, i seriously can't wait to go back and try some of their other amazing concoctions!", 
            "mr says ... o-m-a-k-a-s-e!!!\n\nmrs says ... the wait time was a bit exhausting to me because it was already after midnight local time and my body clock was eastern time. this place was packed at midnight but it's a foretelling that we're in for a fabulous treat.\n\nwait time can be a pain but don't fret and keep your cool. patience is a virtue and you will not be disappointed. \n\ntry and get the omakase - at least one from your party. omakase is the chef's choice from the menu which is shareable with everyone in your party. our server was very good in explaining what's what. moreover, our server must have informed the chef what dish we have ordered because we did not get any duplicate or same dish from the omakase. we basically tried every dish from the menu.\n\nthe house tofu is a must must have. i think i can finish a whole <mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark>. \n\nraku is food artwork. highly recommended for those visiting vegas. this is like the cirque du soleil of japanese charcoal grill.", 
            "i remember the first time i visited which was at least a year or two ago. i was with a small group of friends and we decided to try what seemed to be a tasting menu with a sake pairing with each course. this roughly ran us around $100 a person, but definitely well worth it!\n \nmost recently as my second time, it was pricey for small tapas portions but none the less it was just as wonderful as the first besides no longer offering the sake pairing.. no worries though i didn't allow me to get discouraged. i did however noticed they still offered the chef special tasting menu - $75/$100 - the price difference is based on \"quality\" of food. instead we decided to order off the menu using previous reviews as a guide.\n\nwarning tip* \nbe careful of the board the server brings to the table with no prices. they are \"specials\" especially for your wallet...a small sized cooked sea bass filet - $25, and kanpachi sashimi $23. if your willing to pay, i say go for it but don't be surprised when you see your bill at the end. \n\ni first ordered a refreshing citrusy 750ml bottle of sake for the table - $55. pricey and delishious. i later found out it has a lower alcohol content too. (probably wouldn't order again; however it was nice to taste and try)\n\nthe kobe beef filet skewers are a must! - $12ea (a little steep but i guess quality over quantity), <mark>Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard</mark> was delish - $12 , <mark>Yellowtail Carpaccio</mark> was decent however nothing different than what you can get at any sushi bar in town - $12, enoki mushroom wrapped in bacon was a pleaser for me however not for my other guests (i personally love mushrooms) - $3, half <mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark> was a must try because it was raved as being fresh and homemade (no disappointment there) - $7.50, scallop w/soy sauce was tender and not over cooked (unfortunately there was only one piece) - $7.00, we decided to try kobe beef liver sashimi...texture and all were definitely not my cup of tea. at least i can say i've tried it once and only once.\n\nfor dessert we ordered fluffy cheesecake (by far my favorite) yum! - $6, green tea creme br\\u00fbl\\u00e9e and a strawberry sorbet (both were alright) \nend of the meal the bill was - $275 for four plus a 20% tip. \n\noverall, it met my high expectations as before, with their ambiance, quality of food and my own personal tastebud experience. this place is definitely a hidden vegas treasure off the strip.", 
            "we walked in around midnight without a reservation and got seated in 5 minutes. i really didn't do much research before going there. it was recommended to me as a \"sushi\" place. um, they don't do sushi. no nigiri at all. just the most beautiful sashimi (yes, in the middle of the desert, how do they do that?!) we've ever had. we had the yellow tail carpaccio. we also had <mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark>, rice cakes (soy sauce and wasabi flavored), and every fois gras dish they had on the menu. it was all spectacular. the grilled fois gras was perfect, the rice in the fois gras don was like no other rice i've ever had and the fois <mark>Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard</mark> was a work of art. so delicious, the custard is infused with fois gras and topped with tidbits of rare duck breast. it made for the best midnight snack we've ever had. next time we will make reservations and have the kobe feef skewers.", 
            "make sure you have time to eat here, it takes a while for the food to come out. i could eat the kobe beef with fresh wasabi all day. the <mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark> was excellent, even my fianc\\u00e9 (who doesn't really like tofu) really enjoyed it. i will be back next time i'm in vegas!", 
            "no doubt, one of the best meals i have ever had!\n\n\n--started off with the <mark>Poached Egg</mark> with sea urchin and salmon roe.  personally, i am a big fan of uni so i had to get this dish.  i thought it was great but the sliminess especially when mixed altogether with nameko mushrooms and okras definitely took a little getting used to.  only if there were more texture to counter the offputting consistency, this dish would have been excellent.\n\n--next was <mark>Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard</mark>.  this dish was really interesting since i have never had foie gras integrated with <mark>Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard</mark> before.  the taste is on point with that creamy foie gras texture one would look for.  i decided to give the duck topping to my girl since i annihilated the robata grilled duck.  she said i missed out and should order another so that i could give it a try.\n\n--their <mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark> received rave reviews so we decided to give it a try.  the dish itself has great flavors and the fact that it is homemade makes it that much better!\n\n--also ordered a couple items from their robata grill menu:  \nkobe beef fillet with wasabi [alright]\nkobe beef liver [good]\nkurobuta pork cheek [really good]\npork ear [good]\nduck with balsamic soy sauce [life changing]\n\n--ended the meal with green tea cr\\u00e8me brul\\u00e9e and hot tea.\n\n\noverall experience?  raku is definitely one of the top contenders for japanese cuisine in las vegas.  i enjoyed how great the service was especially since their employees were friendly and helpful--explained everything regarding the restaurant's menu and other daily specials.  as far as the ambiance goes, dining at this place made me feel as if i were actually at a restaurant in japan while eating some really great authentic japanese cuisine.  the restaurant itself is quite small so make sure you make a reservation.  i would certainly come back to try some of their off-menu dishes and maybe even try their \"omakase\" menu.  oh yea, did anybody else notice that huge tree in the bathroom?! ha", 
            "everything is mini tapas style so you can taste a little bit of everything. definitely try the <mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark>. we went with a half order but wish we would've ordered a whole.\n\namazing: \nyellowtail skewer, kobe with wasabi, <mark>Ken Salad</mark>, chicken breast with skin, foies gras with soy, miso soup, shishito peppers .\n\neh:\nscallop was overcooked and salty, pork cheek was too fatty, cheesecake and green tea brulee were ok. \n\ntiny little restaurant but excellent decor and service. definitely reserve ahead of time otherwise sit at the bar if you're lucky. a vegas staple for us.", 
            "raku is one of my favorite restaurants for a number of reasons.  great things happen when i eat here and the food is excellent. to celebrate a special occasion, i went here. we were considering getting the omakase for $100/person but that's like a lottery - you don't know what items you'll get. although i've never had anything i didn't like from this place, we had specific things we wanted to try. \n\nmy faves:\nkobe beef filet with wasabi, kobe beef outside skirt with garlic, duck with balsamic soy sauce, foie gras with glazed soy-base sauce, asparagus with bacon, enoki mushroom wrapped with bacon and green tea creme brulee. i love their blue fin sashimi but we didn't order that this time.\n\naside from my faves, we also tried raku's homemade tofu, juicy deep-<mark>Juicy Deep Fried Chicken</mark>, <mark>Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard</mark>, chicken breast wrapped with chicken skin, kobe beef silver skin, iberico pork and kanpachi kama.\n\nhomemade tofu:\ncan be ordered in half or full portions. comes with ginger, green onions and bonito. the texture of the tofu is so different from all the tofu i've ever had. it has the consistency of formed cottage cheese. 4.5/5\n\njuicy deep-<mark>Juicy Deep Fried Chicken</mark>:\ncrispy skin, juicy fatty chicken. absolutely delicious! 5/5\n\n<mark>Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard</mark>:\nthis dish has the same broth as in <mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark>. this chawanmushi has a mild foie gras taste to it and has a piece of duck on top. 5/5\n\nchicken breast wrapped with chicken skin:\nslightly crisp chicken skin seasoned with salt. for some reason, i really liked the simplicity of this dish. 5/5\n\nkobe beef silver skin:\na bit oily and sweet. this is the skin of a cow put on a skewer and grilled. 4/5\n\niberico pork:\ni love jamon iberico and i was thinking this would be similar. but this is actual chunks of pork with a yummy sauce and grilled. 5/5\n\nkanpachi kama:\nperfectly grilled amberjack collar with a nice ponzu/soy dipping sauce. although i was not in the mood for fish, i still think this is the best kama in town. very meaty, moist (terrible word) and perfectly cooked. 5/5\n\nalthough the last time we went here, they didn't have 2 items we wanted: <mark>Poached Egg</mark> w/ sea urchin and salmon roe and, hamachi kama. they also changed their decor. they replaced hello kitty with a pig with a big mouth - creepy looking mofo! i'd still come back here regardless...", 
            "small tiny place that you have to make reservations for way in advance. my mom made a reservation for us 2 weeks in advance, and if you're late..within 15 minutes they will give your table to somebody else. \n\nlocated in a small tiny corner in chinatown. we got there about 10 minutes before our reservation time, but we were assisted to sit down right away. the food itself takes quite a long time to arrive. we were there for almost 2 hours. it took about a good 45 minutes for the first plate to come out. \n\ni actually prefer shin sen gumi yakitori over this place. the taste isn't as strong as theirs. but, overall it's pretty good. \n\npopeye salad $8- spinach and bacon (mainly), decently good. a little too salty, but a good salad nonetheless!\n\n<mark>Crispy Asparagus Okaki</mark> $5- delicious. super crunchy, and it actually tasty cheesy! nom nom. \n\n<mark>Juicy Deep Fried Chicken</mark> $9- not a favorite. didn't have too much flavor to it, and it was strangely chewy. slightly warm as well. \n\n<mark>Fried Ice Fish</mark> $8.50- frowning as i write this. i don't like fish, and i don't like seeing multiple tiny fishes fried up whole. i ate like 3.. d: no gusta.\n\n<mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark> $11- pretty good! i just didn't like the fish eggs inside, but overall it was a good and flavored dish!\n\nmomo chicken thigh $2.75 each- err, it was a little too pink for my liking, and it was kind of fatty. it was okay \n\ntsukune $3.50 each- shin sen's is much tastier. this one comes as like a drumstick, and i had to keep adding more togarashi. not enough sauce. \n\nharami kobe beef skirt $7.50 each- delicious! comes with grunchy garlic chips. mmm, super tasty!\n\nyakionigiri $5.00 (comes with 2)- it was..okay. lol\n\nscallop with soy sauce $7.00- not sure how this tasted. didn't eat this one!\n\nasparagus with bacon $3.00- comes with 3 pieces, pretty good. \n\nasahi $7.00\n\numeshu $12.00 (super delicious!)\n\noverall, the flavor was almost there, and i didn't think it was the greatest.",

            "the chef here uses a special traditional japanese charcoal that is completely different from american charcoal, to grill pork cheek, mountain trout and a long list of fireside cooking at this elegant izakaya.\n\non my research on the charcoal - it is chemical free, almost smoke free and burns threes times hotter than the regular charcoal for up to 4-5 hours. the lack of chemicals and incredible high heat preserves it's natural juices.\n\ntry the <mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark> - it's a silken house-made tofu topped with salmon roe - it's to die for.", 
            "my wife and i are both japanese and consider this place to be one of the few in vegas to get real japanese food. the <mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark> is great, and i swear they import the asahi straight from japan (japanese beer in this country is really watered down). stuck mostly with the yakitori, so can't say much about the sashimi but he seems meticulous so i'm sure it's great. be prepared to spend some $$ if you're looking to get full though. otherwise plan a trip to in-n-out on your way home lol.", 
            "my third visit to raku was a completely different experience than my last two visits in that this was my first time coming here solo.  because of this, i wasn't able to order as much food since i had no one to share around.  however, from what i ordered during this trip, it was plenty enough to still impress and satisfy me.\n\n<mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark> -- http://bit.ly/1favknu\nthe first two times i visited i had tried their housemade raku tofu and had been amazed by it both times.  so this time i ordered it agedashi style because for one thing, it looks awesome in the photos, and the other is that everything is elevated to awesomer status when it's deep fried.\n\n<mark>Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard</mark> -- http://bit.ly/1h53vde\nyou didn't think i was gonna leave raku, or all of vegas, without getting my foie gras fix since it's banned in my home state of ca.  i had this dish last time i went to raku, but the big difference with this visit is that i got to have this all to myself......bwahahahah!\n\nwagyu sukiyaki -- http://bit.ly/iihiyx\nthis was on the no.1 item on the top of their specials board.  that meant that they wanted you to order it!  like most of the items on the board there is no price listed so you know you're gonna fork up the dollars.  i've never had grade a5 wagyu before so this was my splurge of my entire trip.\n\nthe sukiyaki is cooked right in front of you on top of a bed of their special smoke free charcoal (http://bit.ly/iihcaz).  took about 5 mins to cook.\n\nthere's a lot going on with this pot, first you have the a5 wagyu on top, and underneath all that goodness, you have the housemade raku tofu with clear noodles and veggies.  the trippy part for me was that they give you a raw egg in a small bowl with which you must crack and beat to use for dipping sauce for the beef.  this may be sensitive to some folks, but i had good faith in their product so i went with it and it actually went well with the wagyu beef.  the only minor caveat i had with this dish was that the sukiyaki broth was a little too much on the sweet side.  but that is a really minor complaint because i totally enjoyed this dish.  at $45, for probably the most expensive sukiyaki i've ever had, it was worth every penny!!\n\nraku has done it again to impress me with their top notch service and incredible food.  it has shown me that whether you come in with a group or dine in solo, you'll have an awesome experience no matter what!!  i'll be back again soon!!!", 
            "absolutely fabulous! le cirque, this is how it's done. fabulous service, pride in what they serve, well seasoned food, could not fault it. \nwe tried both the house tofu which was, as someone else described it... like a delicate soft ricotta cheese... but this was better than that... unlike any other tofu i have tried, and the accompaniments really favored the tofu, second on the list was the <mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark>, in a well seasoned broth, delicious. \nan outstanding seared foie gras in a soy based glazed sauce, and although there was evidence of a very small vein, it was so deliciously done, well seared and seasoned, i can certainly overlook it. the kobe beef with garlic was tender and so flavorful, the chicken thigh simple but yummy. also tried the refreshing vinegary cucumber & seaweed with a lighter than expected vinegary taste, and lastly we tried the <mark>Juicy Deep Fried Chicken</mark>, which was delicious, but a bit too pink in the middle for my liking and safety. \nwe missed going to sweets raku afterwards, due that we had $50 worth of jean phillip pastries to go back to", 
            "raku is excellent.  i've been about 3 times now, and each time is solid.  i love great izakaya styled restaurants and used to live in japan, so raku had a high bar to meet.  and it has.  but, some dishes are much better than others.  \n\ngeneral rule of thumb: the grilled meat dishes are excellent -- pork, duck, steak you name it.  this is what they do best.  the fish is hit or miss.  going forward, i don't think i'll be ordering fish from raku.  i'm not sure how they do their sourcing, but my experience with the fish has been a bit splotchy.  the grilled vegetables are all solid.  not anything to write home about but solid.  the tofu dishes are freshly made and also very good.  i love <mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark>, and theirs is one of the best i've had.  anything with foie gras -- also very good.  the uni is very fresh and excellent (despite their splotchy record with their fish)\n\nfor dessert, the green tea creme br\\u00fbl\\u00e9e is excellent -- definitely get it.  \n\nyou'll need to make reservations well in advance but it's worthwhile.  great cozy, modern ambiance.",

            "two words - deliciously expensive.\n\nso our group walked in at 12:30 am on sunday without booking and we had to wait about 15 minutes to get seated. there was a 2 hours dining limit. \n\n<mark>Poached Egg</mark> with sea urchin and salmon roe ($9) - definitely not a dish everyone can accept because of the sea urchin's unique taste, but personally i thought the dish had an interesting texture (gooey and slimy) and a very subtle taste (a bit sweet and a bit salty). overall, a very neat dish.\n\nenoki mushroom w/ bacon ($3 each) - *munch munch munch* chewy and flavorful and it smelled delicious.  \n\nkurobuta pork cheek ($4.25 each) - best order of the night. so chewy, so tender, so juicy, and so mind-blowingly good. \n\n<mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark> (half, $7.5) - not my favorite dish, but it wasn't too bad. slightly fried homemade tofu with dashi broth = very refreshing taste.\n\napple marinated colorado lamb chop ($16) - my goodness, this gotta be the single biggest lamb chop i've ever seen. probably the 2nd best lamb chop i've had and one of the most succulent and smoky lamb chop ever. \n\nkobe beef tendon ($3.5 each) - crispy tendon with rich and fatty taste. i personally liked cheek a bit better, but tendon was really good too. \n\ndefinitely one of the best izakaya i've tried so far. this place is definitely a bit more expensive than your typical izakaya places, but you are essentially paying for quality and not quantity. if some people are willing to spend $50 for vegas buffets, then i don't see why price would be an issue here. after all - this is las vegas right =)?", 
            "located way off the strip in an unassuming shopping center, you'd probably miss this restaurant if you blinked. luckily, the stellar reviews made in part by my fellow yelpers piqued my interest in finding this elusive favorite. now locating the place is a challenge in itself but landing a reservation is equally exhausting!\nas fate would have it, i landed a 9pm dining reservation. woot! little did i know, however, that a reservation merely meant when you arrived, you'd be relegated to waiting an additional 10-15minutes for your seat. \nthat being said, i took the opportunity to park it at the sidebar to glance over the extensive menu while guzzling down a bottle of asahi with shots of chilled nigori. \nhonestly, by the time i was seated, i was about three sheets to the wind! i know, i'm a cheap date.\n\nnow onto the food shall we?\n\ni went with the server's recommendations as well as my seasoned yelp buddies' choices who've had successful dining experiences here previously...\n\nnegitoro blue fin 35$ fresh and buttery slices of blue fin tuna with a cast of delectable condiments that left my taste buds doing a happy dance! trust me, the experience is virtually umami x 10! \n\nwagyu sashimi 20$ - thinly sliced filets of premium rare wagyu beef with a hint of wasabi on top and accompanied with a special savory soy dipping sauce. the first bite was like velvet on my tongue and the mouthfeel was literally like butter melting in my mouth. superb!\n\n<mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark> 7.50$ 1/2 order -a delightful dish with compelling flavors and an irresistibly soft texture that had me pining for more \n\nbutter saut\\u00e9ed scallop 7$ x2 - my favorite dish of the evening. the butter poached scallops were soft and supple with an incredibly mouthwatering garlicky flavor and fluffy texture. absolutely amazing!\n\nenoki mushroom & bacon 3$ x2 come on now, we know everything tastes better with bacon and this was no exception. just order it and thank me later.\n\nchicken wrapped chicken skin 3x2 -tender chunks of chicken breast wrapped in succulent chicken skin. an indulgent  experience that is second to none \n\n<mark>Poached Egg</mark> with sea urchin & salmon roe full cast of delectable ingredients that left my taste buds in a tailspin of delight. intriguing enjoyable and texturally fascinating! \n\nother notable dishes included:\nkobe garlic skirt 7.50 x2\nkurobuta pork cheek 4.25$ x2\n<mark>Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard</mark> 10\nduck in balsamic 4.50$ x2\niberico pork 10 x2\nnigori 40$ well worth it! imo i bought 2 bottles :)\n\nall in all, i had a great dining experience at raku and it's safe to say i'd gladly return to enjoy their enticing small plates again and, of course, to imbibe in their spirits!\n\nhappy eats!", 
            "this has probably been one of the most enjoyable dining experiences i've had this year.\n\nas the other reviews state, it's off the beaten path and i was a little confused when my driver took me to a place in what looked like a strip mall. i asked him a couple times if he was sure we were in the right place.\n\nthere were seven of us and we were promptly sat in the back dining area, where we all had the omakase. we ordered some other specialties as well. but some of my favorite dishes were the wagyu beef sashimi with wasabi, <mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark> (and i normally never really eat tofu, but the flavor was spectacular), <mark>Poached Egg</mark> with sea urchin and roe, and the sashimi was so fresh and prepared perfectly. \n\ni know we ordered a few different bottles of sake, and i wish i could remember the name of it, but there was one that i believe was a junmai ginjo that was phenomenal.\n\ni highly suggest venturing away from the strip to come try this place, it's well worth it.", 
            "i had such high expectations from all the five star reviews,  but i left disappointed. we had a reservation for friday night at 10 pm,  but we didn't need one. there are only 7 tables,  so the place is very intimate. \n\npros: the service was excellent.  very friendly.   we had some plum sake that was rather expensive ($16 for a very small glass) but was very good. \n\ncons: this place is very expensive, so don't come here starving.  don't be fooled by the small price tags.  the portions are equally small.  for instance,  the $3 asparagus wrapped in bacon was the equivalent of maybe one whole asparagus spear. and the $7 scallop was one scallop.  \n\nthe food was all good. but nothing was amazing,  and nothing that i can rave about.  the flavor was good but nothing that was unique. we had:\n\n<mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark>: just ok.  we didn't finish it. \n\ngrilled snapper. very very expensive ($28) for very little fish,  and while it was cooked well,  it was grilled fish,  with no sauce or any special seasoning to make it stand out. just plain grilled fish.  rather boring. \n\nenoki mushrooms wrapped in bacon.  my favorite dish, it was very good. \n\npork cheek: my other favorite dish.  very tender and. flavorful. \n\nchicken wrapped in chicken skin.  good,  but just tasted like regular grilled chicken you cook at home. no special seasoning. .. nothing special. \n\nscallop in soy sauce.   good, but boring. .. for 7 bucks a scallop i expected wow.  \n\nand a few more dishes that were again good, but plain and nothing special. \n\ni won't be back. if the prices were better,  i would,  but for what they charge i expect to be wowed and i unfortunately wasnt.",

            "i came across raku from andrew zimmern. i was watching a random youtube video about las vegas eats, and mr. zimmern swears raku as an anti-vegas destination with some of the best japanese food around. i immediately dropped everything and headed off the strip. raku, located in a dismal looking strip mall in las vegas' very own chinatown, concentrates on good quality japanese cuisine. more of a japanese \"tapas\" bar, most of their items are shared amongst the table. most people associate japanese cuisine with sushi. chef and owner, mitsuo endo showcases a menu with japanese cuisine as an all-inclusive whole. there is no sushi on the menu, though there is raw fish and sashimi. everything is masterfully prepared and they use only the best ingredients.\n\nwe started things off with the uni soup. this was a simple dish that was so refreshing. the broth was soy sauce based and had a subtle seafood essence. filled with seaweed and a few slivers of uni, it was an interesting soup. the uni was flavorful and mellow -- the warm soup made it more toned down and silky. i don't it that is a good thing, but it was delicious. this was a great start to an awesome late night eat.\n\nwe ordered the pork belly to feed the carnivore within. it wasn't necessarily special. the quality and bite of the pork belly was a lot better though. most places will just put some thinly sliced pork belly on a stick, grill it and call it day. raku's was thicker, and more meaty. all in all, it was a deliciously cooked yakitori -- no sauce needed.\n\nsome of the best things i have ever eaten was raku's <mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark>. it is probably the best tofu i ever had. some sad days, i would be home alone. i'd open up a tub of tofu, microwave it, make some kind of soy sauce concoction, and pour it over the tofu. for what it was, it was tasty and i was happy. this <mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark> really changed my life. the tofu is made daily, in house. the fried exterior had a little crispiness with a hint of chewiness. inside, it was completely different -- smooth and silky, and custard like. the broth in itself makes this dish so good. i don't know what was in it, but soy sauce, rice wine vinegar and dashi was definitely in the mix. there was a smudge of red pepper puree on the bowl for a bit of spice. topped with ikira (salmon roe), scallions, and nori, the tofu dish was complex, yet perfectly balanced.\n\nwe ended things with one of my favorite chicken dishes of all time. the <mark>Juicy Deep Fried Chicken</mark>, as they call it, was exactly what the name suggests -- it was juicy. it was deep fried, and it's...chicken. the thigh meat is rolled up skin on, battered, and then fried. the roll is cut up into slices and then served on some vinaigrette dressed spinach. the vinaigrette on the spinach helped with the fatty chicken. as the picture shows, the chicken is a bit pink in the center -- might be a little alarming for sensitive types. for me though, the chicken was so juicy and flavorful -- probably achieved from this near \"medium well\" cooking. it was an exceptional dish in both flavor and texture.\n\nif you want to eat at raku, make reservations. i was given the stink eye when i walked in and said i didn't have reservations. luckily, i was seated within 10 minutes as long as we ate \"quickly.\" most likely, that won't happen to you unless you make a reservation for this small 48 seater restaurant. i was very impressed with the food at raku. the ingredients are of the highest quality and simply prepared. even the water is treated with respect, filtered with a giant charcoal log. details like this, with a passion for perfection makes raku very special. it's not just some japanese restaurant off the strip. it's possibly one of the best in the country.", 
            "the food was just good. i think the 2 dishes that stood out was the homemade <mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark> and egg/ uni/ikura/yamaimo appetizer. the sashimi cuts of the day were also on point!  the sake selection was great . i read rave reviews on the skewers but i just thought they were so so...  a tad bland.. and really  expensive!  the one thing i did not like about this place is how the food is served. i get that the skewers are made to order and the meats all cook at different times, but i really was not expecting dinner to be over 2 hrs long. each dish and skewer came one at a time.. i think it would have been a much more satisfying meal if the skewers came somewhat all together. like i said before. the price point is a bit high .. and some people in party left hungry. :/", 
            "locals favorite? its off the strip. \n\ngood food. good ingredients. good atmosphere!\n\nwe ordered:\nuni tofu with salmon roe- that was delicious\nwagyu beef skewers- lil overrated. its just ok!\n<mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark>- pretty good\n<mark>Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard</mark>- good stuff. very rich!\n<mark>Yellowtail Carpaccio</mark>- good\nthey were all pretty good. not exceptional! \n\n\nbut--- if u want a side of hotsauce, its $2 for a dab!! what?!!\nif you are a hotsauce lover, don't be mad! lol\nfyi: <mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark> came with a dab of hot sauce on the side, it was part of the dish and i didn't just ask for it to ruin the dish or the palate. i simply wanted little more! \n\nservice was ok, they are busy so don't expect like 5 star service!!", 
            "5 stars from a visitor's perspective where restaurants get one chance to make an impression. were i a resident, i might rate it a 4 because of price, crowded quarters, and long waits for tables. but compared to the strip, the prices and the taste seemed heaven-sent.\n\ni went here because i had seen the tofu touted on one of those \"best places i've ever eaten...\" kind of shows. so my expectations were high. i will confess that i liked the <mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark>, but i didn't find it as mind-blowing as others. it was good, but i order agedashi a lot when i eat at sushi joints, and this wasn't the best i've had. that said, i'm not putting it down. it was good.\n\nmy favorite of the night was the kobe beef filet with wasabi. you gotta savor the small bites because there aren't many on the skewer and they are tiny. but as mentioned above, compared to the prices on the strip and the mostly sub-par food i'd had elsewhere, this was excellent. here my run-down of dishes we tried:\n-miso soup (really good)\n-<mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark> (good)\n-kobe beef filet with wasabi (excellent)\n-grilled duck (decent)\n-scallop with soy sauce (good)\n-takana inari (good according to my daughter who loves inari)\n-carpaccio hamachi (very good)\n-kobe beef skirt with garlic (ok--not much flavor)\n\ntiny portions, tiny restaurant. great service. better food than i'd had anywhere on the strip (minus gordon ramsay's steak). well worth a visit when you're in vegas. all of the above plus a sprite for my daughter was $74.70. sure as heck beats $60 for a lousy club sandwich from wolfgang puck!\n\nand by all means, make sure you walk a few doors down and try out sweets raku after dinner. combined, raku and sweets raku are a food experience.", 
            "i was so thrilled to try this place out, but i didn't leave here super pleased. :(\n\nbefore i start this review, i must say that i am not a fan of seafood aka raw fish aka fish aka most of the things on the menu. i prefer cooked foods, chicken, vegetables and red meat. so dun, dun dun, i tried the hiyashi chawanushi, <mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark>, <mark>Crispy Asparagus Okaki</mark>, <mark>Juicy Deep Fried Chicken</mark>, kobe beef filet, kobe beef skirt, grilled duck, and eggplant. \n\nhiyashi chawanushi: this dish was a daily special. i believe it was an <mark>Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard</mark> with crab and something else on top. like i said above, i'm not a fan of seafood, and this dish had such a fishy taste to it. i gagged a little after trying it, and i couldn't get rid of the fishy taste it left in my mouth. we left 90% of it left, because the dish itself was overwhelming.\n\n<mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark>: i have to agree with all the other yelpers. the best and most fresh tofu. get this!\n\n<mark>Crispy Asparagus Okaki</mark>: this dish comes with pieces of asparagus breaded with rice cracker. very delectable. \n\n<mark>Juicy Deep Fried Chicken</mark>: the best dish. like its name, it was six pieces of extremely mouthwatering chicken on a bed of spinach. the chicken itself was superb. the spinach and the sauce complimented the chicken. i definitely recommend this!\n\nkobe beef filet with wasabi/kobe beef skirt with garlic: very nice cuts of kobe beef. i liked the garlic one more, because all i could taste was wasabi and no meat. \n\ngrilled duck: i can't remember much about the duck except for its tangy aftertaste and chewiness. bleh, i guess i was expecting something different. thank goodness they present each table with tea afterwards, because i could not stand the aftertaste.\n\neggplant. grilled eggplant sprinkled with a ton of dried ginger. the eggplant was soft and appetizing, but the ginger ruined it for me. the ginger itself has a strong flavor, and i thought there was just too much ginger on there. i still ate it, but i took off most of the ginger.  \n\nof the eight dishes, i would only come back for the tofu, asparagus and <mark>Juicy Deep Fried Chicken</mark>. maybe we just ordered the wrong things, but i would not come back here. :c", 
            "ok so i just gave trattoria nakamura ya 5 stars and now i'm giving raku 5? \n\ndifferent types of cuisines in the same plaza and when i go to vegas next i'm going here again.  but probably not trattoria mainly bc i'm not as much into pasta. \n\nwe had a party of 5 and ordered the raku tofu, <mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark>, pork cheek skewers, kobe beef liver, kobe beef with garlic flank, fois <mark>Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard</mark>, grilled rice ball with salmon, <mark>Juicy Deep Fried Chicken</mark> and a few other things i'm forgetting but they were all awesome. they tell you the different ways to try everything, sometimes plain first then with their special green tea salt or one of the other special condiments. i'm a sucker for food on a stick...\n\ni wish i could've eaten more but we were full. the only disappointing thing was they didn't have the iberico pork that night. considering we ordered 10 things and paid $25/pp, were full and really enjoyed it there's nothing that would stop me from going back. i wish this place was in my hood, i'd go weekly.", 
            "this was the best dinner i have had in years. we were very lucky to get a reservation at the last minute, the hostess was very sweet and accommodating! the space itself is small, tastefully decorated, and feels like a step outside of vegas entirely- it's quietly luxurious, with intimate tables and dimmed lighting. the minute we sat down, our waiter came over and explained the specials, one of which we decided to order, the sukiyaki. we started with the raku tofu, which you would have to be crazy not to try. it is unlike anything i have ever experienced. the wait staff explain how best to enjoy it (first with some green tea salt, then with some ginger, green onion, and bonito flakes with a bit of soy sauce), and it is unbelievably delicious and silky. even if you don't usually like tofu, i highly recommend trying this! we also tried the <mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark>, which was equally delicious and served in a perfectly seasoned broth with nori flakes and salmon roe, and a little spot of chili sauce on the side of the bowl to be used sparingly. next we tried the kobe beef with garlic, which was another huge hit- incredibly flavorful, tender, just perfect. i am no steak expert, but my boyfriend is, and he was just as blown away as i was. we had the crispy <mark>Juicy Deep Fried Chicken</mark>, which was served on top of a bed of spinach dressed with what i think was a soy vinaigrette- amazing. then came the duck in a balsamic soy glaze, which is another must-order here- again, completely unlike anything i've ever tasted. we shared one stuffed small portobello, which was outstanding, and then came the sukiyaki. if they have this special when you visit, i cannot recommend it highly enough. it comes with eggs, which you crack into your own bowl and then use as a dipping sauce- i didn't do that part, but the sukiyaki itself was just unreal. the broth was perfect, not too salty but by no means bland, and there were noodles, tofu, greens, japanese eggplant, and the most amazing, thin sliced beef either of us had ever tasted. we made the mistake of ordering one too many things, and by the time the grilled rice balls (aka onigiri but without the nori) arrived, we were both right on the verge of being too full. if you are a fan of really high quality rice, you will love these- one is brown rice and flavored with bonito flakes, and one is white rice with a shinto leaf wrapped around it. both are of course fantastic, but for us they weren't the stars of the evening the way the tofu and beef had been. and of course it wasn't over, we ordered the fluffy cheesecake- both of us gasped when we tried it. it is like eating a cheesecake cloud. it is the lightest, fluffiest cheesecake that exists on earth, i am sure of it. even if you decide to follow up your meal with a trip to sweets raku (it was closed when we went, otherwise we probably would have gone- next time for sure!), this is another must. on top of the beyond amazing food, they have a fantastic wine and sake list, and the service was truly exceptional. warm, attentive, prompt, helpful- it felt like we were being spoiled! i seriously can't recommend raku highly enough. we will be coming back all the time!", 
            "some of the best japanese food outside of japan! the food here is superb. i went with a friend when we were in vegas. raku is totally worth the drive of the strip. we ordered a bunch of robata, or charcoal grilled delicacies from simple bacon wrapped enoki mushrooms, to tsukune stuffed portobello mushrooms. all were delicious. the yellowtail glazed with soy sauce was amazing. however my favorite was the <mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark>. the tofu is homemade and one of the best i've had. the tofu is fried and placed in a light broth that was so good i wanted to drink it straight from the bowl! other delicious items were the chazuke, the foie gras chawanmushi udon, and the yuzu sake. \nthis restaurant is popular with foodies and chefs on their off hours, so you know it's good. the service can be a bit slow but that's only because everything is cooked perfectly on a charcoal grill. so to deal with that just order a bunch of things to share and make sure to bring good company!",

            "i've only done las vegas \"buffets\" on the strip... everyone always want to go to the usual big buffets - don't get me wrong, they are wonderful, and the planning of what combination of food best maximizes tastes & value is both an art and a science that i can appreciate...\n\nthis trip, however, was different... one of my good friends (she's an awesome event planner in vegas) decided that it's about time i get a real taste of where the foodies really eat in las vegas...\n\ncue: raku. it's located in an unassuming strip mall where random asian places are located.\n\nit's a small little place, very cozy. one realizes you can't rush things here, the food, the ambiance... is chill, relax. zen. things happen when they do.\n\nwe were in between a wave of tables, so my friend and i waited about 45 minutes for our table. without reservations, on a saturday night, we couldn't complain...\n\nthis is a japanese fusion tapas place - the portions aren't huge, so you can order different things to try and get a taste, and always order more...\n\n---------------------------------------------------\n\nalways asks for today's specials... they have all the specials listed on a chalkboard and the cute japanese waitresses patiently explain what each one is. we ordered my friend's favorites (a foodie trusts another foodie after all) and i was famished...\n\nwhat is this??? the chef sent over a grilled ground chicken skewer on the house! they felt bad we had to wait so long for a table, this started off the night just right. tender, juicy ground chicken, full of flavor but silky smooth, grilled on a skewer and glazed gently with a sweet, sticky sauce lightly. wow, i hadn't thought ground anything can taste like this.\n\nthe next item is tuna belly minced up mixed with flavor oils and minced green onion. the fish is so fresh, it does not even remind me of fish... it tastes of refreshing ocean, and i can feel the breeze...\n\nwe had the sea urchin on soup... i like sea urchin but it is an aquire taste, and it's floating gently on the soup makes one appreciate the delicate urchin and the gentleness of the warm soup that cradles the urchin taste.\n\nwe tried the grilled pork cheeks skewers (get a skewer per person, this is so tasty!) - it tastes like bite size bacon bits with chunks of meat.\n\nwe also had the bacon wrapped enoki mushrooms... how can anything bacon wrap go wrong, really?\n\nnext up is the slippery dish... at least my friend calls it that. a light broth acts as the canvas, floating on top is little mushroom, thinly sliced okra, salmon roes, sliced japanese radish of some kind, <mark>Poached Egg</mark> and sea urchin. everything on this dish is a bit 'slimey' in texture, but all different. it's a complex layering of texture that plays well with each other. (on the other hand, if you hate slimey food, you might not want to get this one)\n\nthen came the favorites of the night...\n\nfoie gras savory steam <mark>Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard</mark> - with a light sauce on top and a piece of duck graces the top of this. the <mark>Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard</mark> was silky smooth, and the richness of foie gras... i had never imagined foie gras can complement the egg so well!!!!!!\n\ngrilled foie gras... a generous portion (for tapas) seared on a grill (smokey flavor!) and gently glazed with a miso-sweet sauce...\n\n\nif you are still reading - we were 2 girls who had all this food. at this point we were done... so full. can't move.\n\nbut dessert calls, and my friend has never tried dessert here.\n\nwe decided to finish the meal off with some 'light dessert' (hahahah light. right). so we ordered the seasonal sorbet, which turned out to be asian pear sorbet.\nwow. it was sweet, juicy, refreshing... the best of an asian pear. it's as if they took the asian pear and froze it and then grind it up into granita... they also drizzled some light condensed milk-cream into the sorbet halfway down the cup. sooo good. a perfect way to finish off a 5 star meal.\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------\n\ni love raku. it's unique, it's interesting. every single plate, from appertizer skewers to dessert, had thought behind it. it's like when you hear music that makes you move with it. when you sit in front of a sunset and life just makes sense. every dish conveyed a message.\n\nlife is way too short to not try this place when you're in town. raku's food touched my soul....\n\n5 stars. absolutely. (pics of the food uploaded to the raku yelp page on top here)", 
            "full review w/ pics in blog.\n\nbeginning first with some appetizers my first choice was <mark>Poached Egg</mark> with sea urchin and salmon roe.  arriving after a short wait and in an ample portion the dish consisted of a cool broth with a warm <mark>Poached Egg</mark> paired with a creamy uni tongue and given a myriad of flavors and textures from a \"soup\" of snappy mountain yams, earthy hon-shimeji mushrooms, salty salmon roe, and pungent green onions.  breaking the egg and stirring the broth it thickened quickly giving the whole dish a mellow and creamy texture that paired beautifully with the fresh uni and other ingredients - at $7 this may have been the most affordable uni i'd ever experienced with such great taste and honestly i would go back to raku just to experience this dish again.\n\narriving shortly after my first plate was finished - and with an explanation of all the little jars and bottles in front of me (a matcha sea salt, a house made soy, a japanese pepper + rice vinegar, and a chili infused oil) - seafood with bonito guts pickled in salt looked and smelled much better than the name would arouse in one's imagination.  as others have mentioned, i really do not understand how this dish was a mere $6.  a heaping bowl filled with a mix of sashimi yellowfin, jackfish, salmon, mackerel, and sprouts each fish was extremely fresh and the sprouts lent some texture to the fleshy-melt-in-your-mouth fishes.  topping the dish, according to my young server, was a combination of the house soy and the vinegar.  adding a bit more soy to the already salty mix made the flavor perfect, in my opinion, though i do believe the dish could have benefited from some daikon or perhaps a crisp starch to add a bit more texture.\n\nthe next dish - well, let's just say it was so good that i ordered a second portion as my main course.  entitled simply <mark>Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard</mark> with foie gras the dish looked simple enough - a miso broth with scallions and a piece of robata duck floating in the broth.  what laid beneath the broth, however, was the true treasure of the dish - a rich and hearty chawanmushi (<mark>Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard</mark>) laden with ample accents of foie gras.  when stirred up with the wooden spoon the foie tones rose amply to the palate with the whole dish tasting like the combination of a sweet <mark>Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard</mark> and an unctuous foie gras terrine.  while the grilled duck added a fine degree of texture to the dish, i personally thought the duck was a slight bit gamey - not bad, just not perfect.  \n\nseeing this dish also offered in the noodle section as an udon accompaniment i inquired from my server as to whether i could get that dish as a main course, but instead substitute the robata foie gras for the duck.  not quite understanding my question my server went and got another server who understood perfectly, asked the chef, and assured me this would be no problem.  receiving this dish after my robata choices and just before dessert i would strongly suggest anyone who attends raku try this substitution for two reasons - number one, the manner in which the robata grill's high temperatures crisps the foie gras exterior while leaving the center fatty and smooth is unlike anything i've previously experienced - the charring actually mellows the foie all on its own and the texture is more \"firm,\" not unlike the roasted version i had at blackbird in chicago, actually.  number two - those udon noodles served thin and cold to be dunked into a broth of foie gras, <mark>Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard</mark>, and more foie gras...think \"chicken soup\" in its perfect form.\n\nbetween my two foie dishes i decided to indulge in a couple of raku's robata skewers - chicken breast with skin.  fresh organic chicken wrapped in its own skin and cooked to crispy this dish presented some of the most <mark>Juicy Deep Fried Chicken</mark> i've had in some time while the addition of the skin added a crisp \"crackle\" without any breading - better than the colonel without all the carbs and oil.  adding first the soy and then the salt i have to say i was quite impressed by the manner in which the matcha's bitter texture worked with the savorieness of the chicken and salt.\n\nrobata course two was kurobuta pork cheek and it, like the chicken, was excellent.  typically quite fatty the high heat of the grill managed to melt the collagen perfectly while burning off some of the fat and only mildly crisping the skin.  the 'rarest' pork i've had since the chop at babbo i found this to be my favorite, tastewise, of the robtata items and would compare it favorably to some of the better pork belly dishes i've had in terms of taste, texture, and fat to meat ratio.\n\nthe third robata course was something i've never eaten - pigs ears.  sure i've had trotters, tail, tete, belly, cheek, and all the standard cuts - but not ear.  as others have stated - wow.  crispy and salty on the outside, fatty next, and a thin chewy layer of cartilage in the middle - almost a 5-layer sandwich with each layer giving a different taste and texture experience.",

            "three words - live uni udon.  say whaaat??\n\nyeah, you heard me.  raku sacrifices the lives of innocent sea urchin to serve you their deliciously sweet roe mixed with thin udon in a cool dashi (?) broth.  the whole thing is topped off with salmon eggs, green onions and a chiffonade of shiso.  all this is presented from within the still beautiful (but now deceased) sea urchin shell.\n\nother noteworthy dishes:  <mark>Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard</mark> topped with a seared piece of duck breast.  my husband was too tired to eat his so i ended up eating about one and a half before the richness got to me and i had to stop.  \n\ntheir homemade tofu is always a must - you can get it half \"agedashi\" and half served cold.\n\nskewers:  salmon, pork cheek, tendon...drooooool....\n\nif they have it on the specials menu, you must get the <mark>Fried Ice Fish</mark> - deep fried whole tiny fishies. when sprinkled with the lemon wedge and the green tea house salt, it's amazing.  \n\ni tried to get them to sell me their salt (green tea powder, roasted salt and shitake powder is what the waitress told me) but apparently it's proprietary.  poo!  well...that just means we have to keep going back to have more.\n\nsmall place, seats about 35 people, i would, including at the bar.  stays open late so it's perfect for a 2nd dinner! :d", 
            "forget korean tacos, hello japanese tapas!\n\nthis was one of my favorite meals in sin city and it was off the strip, tucked in a mini-mall. i was surprised at how hot this restaurant was on yelp because it was tiny and unpretentious... unlike the rest of lv. we had the: \n\n- <mark>Poached Egg</mark> with sea urchin and salmon roe\n- fried homemade tofu in hot broth\n- kobe beef fillet with wasabi\n- kurobuta pork cheek\n- foie gras\n- enoki mushroom wrapped with bacon\n- cold udon noodle with <mark>Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard</mark> soup\n- fluffy cheesecake\n\neverything was small but incredibly flavorful. all the meats danced and melted on my tongue. you know a restaurant is a winner when it can charge $10 for tofu and i can leave without bitching, whining, or crying. the only item that i wouldn't order again is the cheesecake, but then again--i should've known better than to get that at a charcoal grill.\n\ni wish raku would move to sf... because i'm not that interested in relocating to lv.", 
            "delicious & expensive!\n\ni had:\ncold udon noodle with <mark>Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard</mark> soup: $16 \n---- it made by a very unique way \n\nfried homemade tofu in hot broth: $9\n---- it's so special and few ways to eat it\n\nfoie gras: $14 \n---- very small piece but super expensive\n\nsalmon special \n---- i love this one the most but still personally think it's too oily on the side\n\nif you are coming from las vegas blvd, pass 15 fwy and chinatown and keep going, right after you pass decature, there is a korea plaza on your right... just make a turn and this place is on the left corner of this plaza ( you will see a big massage sign 1st )!", 
            "i wonder if this place has any connection to the original raku that opened up in vancouver?  it's certainly in line with the string of izakaya's we have up here.\n\nraku is classier, less trendy and boisterous than the vancouver izakaya's, but the food is solid.  \n\nof the hits, the foie gras with <mark>Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard</mark> appetizer - the custard is the winner, subtly foie flavoured and so silky.  the foie gras on top was a bit tough with a layer of fat.  made for a chewy mouthful instead of one that should have melted with the custard.\n\nthe deep-<mark>Crispy Fried Shrimp</mark> special were great - crackly, salty, fresh.  eat the shell, eat the head - leave the eyeballs.  \n\ntheir home-made tofu is also a winner.  we tried it both ways, cold - served in a half moon, with green tea salt and agedashi hot fried - served in a nice broth and garnished with salmon roe.  \n\nthe kobe beef with wasabi skewer was nicely smokey and tender.  not as much marbling as i would have liked.  \n\ntheir red snapper sashimi special was amazingly fresh.  i was impressed, i wasn't expecting to find that kind of quality here. \n\ntheir green tea creme brulee is well-executed, served with green tea ice cream and whipped cream that i could have done without.  their bubbly brown sugar pudding is interesting.  the bubbly part comes from frothed up milk?  it's quite bland, you need to eat it with the jelly-like brown sugar pudding.\n\nthis place would be great as a first-date night.  service was first-rate, clearing dishes at almost every round of food.", 
            "thank you, yelp.  the reviews intrigued me, and i had three of the best meals of my life.  my tastes are on the adventurous side, so i ordered many items i had never heard of.  all were wonderful.  i highly recommend the fried homemade tofu in hot broth and the <mark>Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard</mark> with foie gras.  i enjoyed  several of the grilled selections, especially the chicken breast wrapped in chicken skin and the potato with corn ( a visual surprise).\n\ni ordered many of the daily specials and felt well rewarded.  these items can cost as much as $30, so it is worth asking the price.  \n\ni usually go to lotus of siam when in vegas, but raku stole my heart (stomach?) this trip.", 
            "so happy o be back here again after our first visit almost a year ago!  it's def my favorite restaurant off the strip!!!  many famous chefs come here after work and you know the restaurant is good when it's japanese owned and with japanese customers!!  my fav are the housemade tofu half & half, <mark>Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard</mark> w/ foie gras, grill chicken w/ skin, grill kobe beef w/ garlic, grill pok belly, <mark>Poached Egg</mark> w/ sea urchin, beef tendon oden, and basically all other grill stuff.  everything is amazing here including their homemade greentea salt and soy sauce!", 
            "of all the cities, bars, restaurants and otherwise i've indulged my way through as a result of yelp-scouting, raku sits alone as my shining star. a few come close (uchi in austin comes to mind) but none quite capture the same balance of satisfaction vs. value vs. location that raku does. it is, my greatest yelp. \n\nwhen you can ride 200 reviews to a nearly flawless five star rating i feel little need to chronicle the intricacies of the place. just know that it's about a $10 cab ride (each way) from the strip, is quite small (with a couple of quaint private rooms) so reservations are recommended and it hands down serves the best food i've had in sin city until an honest 3am. \n\ni was in vegas this past week for an extended bachelor party and had narrowed down my \"must-do\" list to raku from an initial pool of about 12 reccomendations on yelp. while i eventually did manage to hit 3 or 4 candidate restaurants i suspected that i might only have one shot at a chance to steal away from the guys (not foodies) and see what the place was all about. it absolutely did not disappoint. \n\ni grabbed a seat at the five or six occupancy bar and immediately made friends with a cute japanese girl who as it turned out was something of a fixture. she helped me through the menu (and three bottles of sake) from 11pm until after 3am as well as acted as intermediatary between myself and the owner. whether or not he actually spoke english or just found my position amusing i don't know, but even without speaking to each other directly he was a cheery and fun guy. \n\nto satisfy my own memory i'll try and list everything i had. all were amazing, a few spectacular.\n\n-seafood with bonito guts pickled in salt\n-fresh kobe beef liver with garlic (had it sashimi style, also available seared)\n-<mark>Poached Egg</mark> with sea urchin and salmon roe\n-fried homemade tofu in hot broth (best tofu i've ever had, in amazing broth with salmon roe)\n-raku's tofu (unfried version of above, served with green tea salt and spicy vinegar, had a half portion of each)\n-steamd <mark>Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard</mark> with foie gras (holy crap, maybe my favorite)\n-chicken thigh (perfectly seasoned and grilled, on skewers, wow)\n-mushrooms (small, brown and marinated then grilled, don't remember much else)\n-ayu kanro-ni (caramely whole river fish marinated in soy/sake/mirin and wrapped in banana leaf)\n-crispy chicken knees (sort of a chewier version of pork cracklins'...dude!)\n-some sort of sweet/salty rice cracker sticks\n-asparagus grilled and crusted with rice cracker\n-asian pear sorbet (holy freaking crap...utterly amazing)\n\ndishes ran anywhere from $3 up to about $12 for the foie gras and kobe liver. with three bottles of sake (no idea what they were, my dining companion picked three different ones), approx. 15 dishes (i'm forgetting a few), a $40 tip and some cash to the chef behind the grill/bar, i was still out of there for just a little over $200. \n\nmy best advice if you find yourself within 200 miles of vegas is eat here, at all costs, if you're at all into japanese pub food. it's the best experience i've had in this country. if you speak any japanese this is a great place to use it. that can be a mistake at most of the nice/trendy sushi places around the us where the majority of employees hail from other parts of asia. but at raku a boisterous \"itadakimasu!\" will be greeted with cheers; everyone is straight out of nihon.\n\noh and don't miss the specials board, 10 or so off-menu options that comprised most of my favorite selections.", 
            "i took my hubby here for his birthday together with our two kids. husband is japanese (born and raised in japan) and really enjoys authentic japanese food, which is overall very hard to find in the us.\n\nbased on the yelp reviews i decided to give this a try. called for a reservation pretty late and was given the table by the door. maybe not the best table in the restaurant, but we really wanted to do so we decided to take it. upon arriving, we were given another table as another customer had cancelled. great!\n\nnow the food; we ordered several dishes and all were really spectacular. some that stood out were:\n\n- fried homemade tofo  ...  this is the best tofu and stock i have ever tasted. all is homemade, the tofu, dashi soup, etc ... no msg's used which is so nice and the flavors are so well balanced and mild.\n- kobe beef tendon ... just think about butter melting in your mouth ... so tender and juicy ... the best of the best.\n- foie gras flavored <mark>Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard</mark> ... a little different from what you would find in japan, but again the flavors were so well balanced.\n\nyou will notice that you will eat less of this food as the flavors are so satisfying and the food takes some time to come out as all is made fresh. we spend about $100 for two adults and two children. well worth the money!\n\noverall an incredible experience at a very reasonable price and well worth a five star! will sure to go back when visiting vegas in the future and would definitely recommend this to everyone who really enjoys top quality authentic homemade japanese food.", 
            "i'm stoked that my 100th review will be for such a great restaurant!\n\ni have been wanting to try raku ever since i heard about it. the first couple times we tried to go, we called that day and they were booked until way past my bedtime. so we decided to plan ahead and made reservations a couple of weeks in advance. i wanted to make sure and try the best items so when we made our reservations, i requested the $75 omakase dinner. \n\nfor our first course we had the <mark>Sashimi Salad</mark>. this was one of my favorites of the night. it came with 2 dressings, one spicy and one sweet. the fish was high quality. the crisp onions on top provided a nice flavor and textural contrast. it was a lovely way to start our meal.\n\nnext we were served raku's tofu. they make their own tofu and it comes with bonito, green onion, and ginger. the waitress suggested using the green tea salt and soy sauce to season it as well. the soy sauce is homemade and has a slightly sweet flavor. the tofu had a creamy, smooth texture. i never imagined imagined eating plain tofu and liking it, but i did.\n\nfor our third course we had <mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark> which was deep fried tofu in a miso broth topped with salmon roe. it was exceptional. this was another of my favorites of the night. i don't know how they make tofu so delicious!\n\nnext up was grilled tomatoes. they had a nice charcoal grill flavor.\n\ncourse 5 was <mark>Juicy Deep Fried Chicken</mark>. it was served on a bed of spinach and had awesome crispy skin with sesame. it was indeed juicy and very tasty.\n\nwe then had asparagus with bacon. it consisted of 3 small spears of asparagus wrapped in bacon. the bacon had a nice smoky grilled flavor.\n\nour seventh course was butter sauteed scallop with soy sauce. the scallop was nicely cooked and the sweet soy sauce complemented the dish nicely. this was in my wife's top three dishes.\n\nour next dish was yellowtail with glazed soy-based sauce. it was served with minced radish. the radish made the dish go from good to great. it was a perfect pairing.\n\nnext up was chicken wrapped with skin. it was salty and was a great contrast to the previous slightly sweet courses. the skin was sinfully good.\n\nwe then were served kurobuta pork cheek. it was chewy and reminded me of steak fat. that might not sound appetizing, but it was really good.\n\nfor our 11th course we had kobe beef outside skirt with garlic. my wife loved how the garlic chips complemented by the beef. i liked it too, but by this time i was getting full.\n\nnext was another of my favorites, <mark>Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard</mark>. the custard was beautifully cooked. it was served in a delicious broth. though i was getting full by now, i couldn't stop eating it.\n\nafter that we were served tsukune grilled ground chicken. it looked like a chicken sausage. i was stuffed so i only ate a bite and took the rest home.\n\nwe then were given grilled rice balls. one was flavored with soy sauce and the other with miso. i only had a bite and packed the rest.\n\nlastly, we were given two desserts. first up was green tea creme br\\u00fbl\\u00e9e. the green tea ice cream was subtly flavored and just slightly sweet. it was a nice balance to creme br\\u00fbl\\u00e9e.\n\nour other dessert was cheesecake. it had raspberries hidden inside. i love raspberries, and when i ate the raspberry sitting on top of the cheesecake i exclaimed, \"that's a nice raspberry!\"  the cheesecake was fluffy and airy. it was served with a delicious raspberry sauce and green tea salt.\n\nplaying in the background was japanese elevator music, including a rendition of michael jackson's \"beat it\" which was pretty neat.\n\nthe bathroom has artificial grass on the floor, a fake tree growing up the wall, foliage on the ceiling, birds playing in the background, and flower petals on the floor. a must see!\n\nthe meal was definitely delicious, but i think we should have gone with a $50 omakase meal as there were about five too many courses. i well definitely go back! can't wait to try my favorites again and sample some new dishes!", 
            "this might be our favorite restaurant experience of all time.  hidden in a strip mall, raku instantly surprises you with decor that is modern and stylish and yet reminiscent of a traditional restaurant in japan.\n\nthe food is truly amazing here.  a mix of standard and original dishes, smartly conceived, and expertly prepared with very fresh ingredients.  every offering is an adventure in flavor and texture.  i've often wondered what it must be like to sit at the judges' table of the original iron chef, but i can't imagine it's much better than having a meal at raku.\n\nsome highlights:\n\n<mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark>: creamy and smooth tofu delicately fried and served in a savory broth.  loved it, and i don't even particularly like tofu.\n\n<mark>Poached Egg</mark> with sea urchin and salmon roe, with okra and daikon and mushrooms and broth: so much contrast between the different ingredients, and yet it all makes for a great dish.\n\n<mark>Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard</mark>: heavenly.\n\ngrilled foie gras: sinful.\n\n<mark>Sashimi Salad</mark>: very fresh fish on a bed of greens, lovely dressing, crispy fried onion topping.\n\nfluffy cheesecake: beautifully presently, wonderfully light.  a sublime finish.\n\nthe wait staff was very welcoming, friendly, responsive, and helpful.  on top of everything else, the portions are relatively large, and the prices are quite affordable for the quality of food.  my wife and i had about 9 different dishes, were totally satisfied, and made it out with a total bill under $100.\n\nvisit both restrooms.  very pleasant and surprising.\n\nif you're in vegas, forgo the restaurants on the strip and visit raku.", 
            "4.5 stars\n\nraku is one of the off-strip las vegas restaurants i hear most about. raku's charcoal-grilled robata is one of the restaurant's specialties, but they also offer a variety of fresh fish and an assortment of cold and hot plates. before going in, i asked around for recommendations and the answers i got spanned the whole menu. clearly, the restaurant does a lot of things well.\n\nwe ordered a bunch of things in no particular order, but started with an amuse from the kitchen.\n\ntaiwanese spinach, enoki mushrooms, shitake mushrooms, bonito flakes - light and refreshing, this was a nice start to the meal.\n\nbluefin tuna sashimi - the restaurant has a chalkboard of daily specials, and this was one of them. oh my goodness...this was fantastic. exceptionally flavored and really tender, this was so good. easily better than much of the toro (and this wasn't toro) i've had in other restaurants; it briefly reminded me of urasawa.\n\n<mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark> - this homemade tofu was very good - soft and delicate with a subtle but present soy flavor. prepared agedashi style, the umami-rich broth was also very good.\n\n<mark>Crispy Fried Shrimp</mark> - the shrimp here were crispy as advertised and moist on the inside. nothing special really, but good. i'm never really sure if i'm supposed to eat these sort of things in its entirety, shell-on; but we did in this case.\n\n<mark>Crispy Asparagus Okaki</mark> - another crispy dish, i enjoyed the contrasting tenderness of the asparagus with the crispy rice cracker breading. there was a nuttiness to the breading, which i thought also went well with the vegetable.\n\n<mark>Juicy Deep Fried Chicken</mark> - this was a little bit unique as it seemed to be chicken that was rolled up, then fried and cut. juicy on the inside and crispy on the outside - no complaints here.\n\n<mark>Yellowtail Carpaccio</mark> - the fish was good here, but the bluefin spoiled me a bit as it didn't seem as special. still, the wasabi and yuzukosho did a nice job of brightening up the yellowtail in this dish.\n\nfish of the day - yellowback seabream - this was one of the fish of the day, served whole. it was a pretty small dish with only about 8 chunks of white flesh. it was very good though, with a crispy exterior from the deep frying.\n\n<mark>Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard</mark> - the custard was silky smooth with a fairly subtle foie gras flavor. very comforting. the piece of duck breast on top was pretty good too.\n\nwe proceeded with a number of robata-grilled dishes.\n\nbutter saut\\u00e9ed scallop with soy sauce - the scallop (served in its shell) was cooked well, but i thought the butter was a little overpowering here.\n\nchicken thigh - this was the first piece where i could really get a sense of the charcoal grill flavor. there was a smoky char on the chicken, and it was moist and flavorful. really simple and really good.\n\nkobe beef filet with wasabi - again, a good smoky flavor from the grill paired with some really flavorful tenderloin. surprisingly juicy and flavorful. i liked the fresh wasabi as well, countering the rich meat. delicious!\n\nkurobuta pork cheek - i was surprised to find this rather chewy, kind of like a chicken gizzard. maybe i just haven't really had cheek in this type of preparation. it was well-marbled, and the porky flavor was present.\n\nkobe beef tendon - not my favorite. i never really like the tendon though, and this was like a big blob of gooey tendon. so meltingly tender, i wasn't sure if i was biting into fat or tendon. i think this was probably a very good preparation, but it's not my thing.\n\nduck with balsamic soy sauce - an interesting dish here - the duck was prepared well, and the balsamic soy and fresh onions did a good job of cutting through some of the richness.\n\napple marinated lamb chop - tender and juicy, this was a damn good lamb chop. i'm not sure if i got any apple flavor though, but i didn't mind.\n\nkobe beef outside skirt with garlic - really good. exceedingly tender and flavorful, with a nice garlic touch.\n\ni had high expectations for raku and i wasn't disappointed. in fact, it exceeded them. after dining at places from joel robuchon and jose andres, it was nice to get something rather simple with clean, familiar flavors. almost like a detox, if you will. the raw fish preparations (ooh the bluefin!) and the robata-grilled items stood out most to me, but it was a well-rounded meal.", 
            "time for an update!  since my last review i've been to the sake tasting and had the kaiseki menu. \n\nfirst, the sake tasting.  this happened back in february.  $45 for ayce raku food plus all the sake and sapporo you can drink!  all the tables are reorganized for a cocktail-type service.  the food is freshly cooked and is served at the bar buffet style in the front of the restaurant.  small servings of tofu, various skewers of meat from the robata grill, asparagus wrapped in bacon, all the good stuff.  the staff just keeps cooking and bringing food out.  it was from 10pm to 2am, which is not the best time for me, but it was worth it!  not too crowded.  we made a reservation but they accepted walk-ins too.  people come and go as they please so that helps.  the sake servers are really knowledgeable.  i learned a lot.  i really, really hope they do this again but i have not seen another announcement for this since the last one in february.  such a good deal and so much fun, too!\n\nsecond, i had the 15-course kaiseki menu earlier this month.  this is not for the faint of heart or those who are in a hurry.  it's $150 per person and they need at least 3 days notice.  you need to make a reservation and they take your credit card number because they actually start preparing your meal 3 days in advance!  the website says it takes about 3 hours to complete.  ours took around 3.5 hours.  it was an awesome experience!  the menu changes each time but here are some of the highlights: homemade tofu served with roe, sashimi, <mark>Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard</mark>, a sampling of their appetizers including <mark>Juicy Deep Fried Chicken</mark> and crispy asparagus, steak and garlic cooked on a really hot stone, and fluffy cheesecake.  i've downloaded pics if you are interested.  definitely come hungry.  i didn't eat all day.  there is also a $100 10-course menu.\n\nthis is my favorite restaurant in all of las vegas.  once i get off my stupid diet, i'm going here.", 
            "ok, there are 260+ reviews with average of about 4.5 star rating, so i don't think there is anything i can add that hasn't been said before.  one word - delicious.\n\nwe love raku so much that we went back the 2nd night for dinner during our short vegas stay.  i have not been wow'd so much during a single meal.  i love the <mark>Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard</mark>, the bacon wrapped tomato (and i don't like tomato usually), the beef tartar... i can go on and on and on and on...\n\none thing i want to note is that the service was excellent.  the servers really took their time to explain the dish and suggest ways to add flavor/sauce to them.  all around, great food, great experience, great service, and love the atmosphere!", 
            "i've been here countless times, even twice in 1 night because the food was so good. i would suggest making a reservation atleast a few days or weeks in advance. they are only open for dinner, so if you decide last minute call right when they open and i've been able to grab either a late dinner (after 10) or at the bar. they are usualy very busy and packed though, but because of their small size they can't accommodate a large volume.\n\nthey have their staple foods like wasabi kobe beef, bacon wrapped asparagus, their 1/2 cold 1/2 fried tofu, and of course their daily specials. i always try to get atleast 1 dish off their specials. be sure to get any of their whole fish whenever it's offered. they serve half of it sashimi style and the pieces literally melt in your mouth. the other half they threw on the grill and it was so moist. i am not a fan of foie gras but i tried some of their <mark>Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard</mark> a friend ordered and it was delicious. i don't think i've ever been disappointed with a dish i've ordered from here and i've almost tried everything. i would say the average price is about $30-40 per person unless you include alcohol then it will go up. i'm hoping to hit their 15-course the next time i'm in vegas and will update if i do.", 
            "it took so many attempts to finally try raku.  one failed reservation and one failed late night arrival (kitchen closed like 10 mins before i got there), later, i finally got a reservation... for 10pm at night.\n\ni was hoping for an early dinner time to party after but honestly, i had to try raku and was not disappointed at all.\n\nevery dish ordered was amazing but there is a list of must-try items:\n\n1. half n half order of the amazing <mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark> and cold house made tofu.  the agedashi broth was delicious and the tofu had the perfect fried coating.  the star of this dish was the cold tofu.  the texture was like panna cotta and melted in your mouth.  combined with the delicious sauces and spice blends on the table... a party in the mouth.\n\n2. <mark>Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard</mark>.  honestly it may sound a little off putting or an interesting dish, but holy crap.  this is a rich dish and not for the faint of heart, but the richness and sweetness of the <mark>Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard</mark> combined with the salty flavor of the foie gras was divine.\n\n3. kobe beef outside skirt with garlic.  kobe is always good and combined with the crispy garlic slice made for a great spicy/rich and crunchy/tender balance of flavor and texture.\n\n4. enoki mushroom wrapped bacon.  take one part bacon and one part mushroom and you have such a delicious dish.  the enoki provides a surprising crunch and the bacon fat singsssssss.  this is a deceptively complex dish exploding with flavor.\n\n5. duck with balsamic soy sauce.  the sauce on this dish is lick-the-plate good.  what else is there to know?\n\nmy only wish is i had multiple stomachs like a cow to consume the entire menu.",

            "when you start off knowing that all the major players eat here, you know you're in for a meal of a lifetime. not only does raku serve beautifully executed food, it's a bargain at 10+ courses for only $50pp. the icing on the cake is knowing that you may run into joel robuchon, guy savoy, or even mario batali in his orange crocs. raku is the only place that has managed to \"wow\" me even more on the second visit as compared to the first. and that's not discounting the first meal because that was exquisite in and of itself. however on the second visit, raku was able to re-invent itself and offer even more delectables and a considerably different tasting menu that wowed my palate even more.\n\nthe restaurant is unassuming, located in a strip mall in chinatown. the decor is minimal with two bathrooms with serious personality. the service is unfussy but genuine and you can tell that they take great care in plating and execution without taking it too seriously. the flavors are clean and emphasis is on using only the best ingredients. all of the components of each dish are well thought out and serve a purpose. the results are nothing short of amazing.\n\nmy favorites are as follows:\n*<mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark> - homemade tofu melts in your mouth and the broth is heavenly, literally out of this world!\n*<mark>Juicy Deep Fried Chicken</mark> - amazingly <mark>Juicy Deep Fried Chicken</mark> wrapped in <mark>Juicy Deep Fried Chicken</mark> skin...need i say more...\n*<mark>Crispy Asparagus Okaki</mark> - the crispy fry on the outside of the asparagus adds the perfect crunch and toasted rice flavor to add incredible depth. add some green tea salt to bring out the flavors even more\n*dried tatmi <mark>Dried Tatami Sardine Salad</mark> - ceasar salad kicked up a notch, great briny and cheesy flavor\n*kurobuta pork cheek robata - juicy and great grill flavor from the robata\n*<mark>Fried Ice Fish</mark> - beautifully <mark>Fried Ice Fish</mark> served whole with fish nuggets in again, heavenly broth\n*enoki mushroom wrapped in bacon robata - it's wrapped with bacon...need i say more\n*<mark>Yellowtail Carpaccio</mark> - sashimi was incredibly fresh\n*grape tomatoes robata - so simple but simply delicious...add the green tea salt and you're going to be impressed and want to try to make it at home\n*salmon ikura don - beautifully presented and then served into individual portions. the ikura pops in your mouth to bring the taste of the ocean to the salmon rice.\n*udon noodle with <mark>Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard</mark> soup - the broth as well as the noodles were amazing\n*eel don with gobo - again, served with heavenly broth. the gobo added great depth by bringing a bit of earthy bitterness to balance the salty and sweet.\n*<mark>Crispy Fried Shrimp</mark> - fried little shrimpies, delicious.. \n*sorbet of the season - so simple, a strawberry sorbet with condensed milk. the combination makes the sorbet take on a creamy texture and the fruit flavor packs a good punch to end the meal. the kiwi one was delicious as well \n\n\nthe things i would forgo to save room for the things above:\nchicken thigh robata\nchicken breast wrapped with chicken skin robata\nkobe beef outside skirt with garlic robata\n<mark>Tofu Salad</mark> \"caprese\" with seaweed, tomatoes, and dried fishies", 
            "raku, quite simply, is my favorite japanese restaurant in the world.  \n\nfeaturing a diverse menu of grilled, stewed, and cooked japanese items, raku features equally diverse price points for dining as well.  order exclusively off the robata grill and stewed menu and you can easily eat for under $20/person.   feel more adventurous and trusting of the chef at $45/person and you'll leave feeling full and satisfied while trying more exotic fare.  or finally opt for a formal kaiseki menu (3 day advance order) and you'll have a divine japanese food experience that will challenge any set menu you've probably ever had.  \n\nno matter what price point you select, raku's constant will be exceptionally prepared food.   people have called even the priciest meals here true bargains and it makes everything else simply a steal. \n\nthe drink selection that pairs well with the food is equally diverse and just as price friendly.  bottles of quality sake, japanese beer, and cocktails range from amazingly under $10 to well north of $150.  anyone can truly eat here and  if i lived closer i'd be having regular weekday meals, special celebratory meals, as well as any weekly meal i could sneak in. \n\nsome standouts from our most recent meal:\n\n<mark>Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard</mark> with smoked duck and black truffle - representing the clear high end, this dish utilizes almost every high priced ingredient in a chef's repertoire.  the flavor was divine as the <mark>Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard</mark> was cooked perfectly and presented in a gorgeous empty egg shell.  the black truffle was a decadent, but much appreciated, addition. \n\nkobe beef seared over hot rock with garlic - perfectly presented on a bed of hot rocks, the kobe beef is seared to perfection.  the thinly sliced garlic adds the minimal flavoring needed. \n\ndaikon and beef tendon oden - the other end of the price spectrum and the most affordable items on the menu at $1.50 and $2 respectively.   ultimate comfort food...perfectly sliced and tender beef tendon and stewed daikon radish served in a perfect broth complimented by a small wallop of japanese mustard.  \n\nfresh oyster served with minced okra, seasoned scallions and uni - again the presentation was perfect as the oyster was shelled and delicately sliced before being placed back in the shell.  the fresh uni and seasoned scallions perfectly counteracted the brininess of the oyster. \n\noverall, my meal at raku was one i had looked forward to all year and it did not disappoint.   while we indulged for a special occasion, we still found amazing bargains in the oden stew and the extensive sake selection.  \n\nraku is truly a special restaurant and their dedication to top quality food is evident the moment you sit down and notice that every condiment (ie: salt, pepper, chili oil, soy sauce) is house made.   it only gets better from there. \n\nfor those who love comparisons, i can attest for me that my meals here have been better than some of my favorite japanese restaurants in the past, including, but not limited to: gochi (cupertino), sumika (los altos), nobu (hk), momofuku (nyc), morimoto (ca) and many more.  yes, many of those places are great but i love raku even more. i still can't believe it's in vegas!\n\nraku accepts all credit cards, including american express.", 
            "kaiseki with sake pairing is the way to go!\n\ni have been hearing about the kaiseki menu and i finally had a chance to experience it.  kaiseki is an artistic and gracious japanese seasonal course cuisine.  raku offers 2 kaiseki options: 10 courses or 15 courses.  i ordered the 15 course kaiseki with sake pairing.  all the dishes were beautifully and artistically presented.  they were uniquely flavored yet all blends together like a harmony.  i don't know the name of each dish but i am going to try to describe some my personal highlights in the order of the course (good thing i took pictures to help me remember):\n\nhighlight 1: i believe it was course 2 - a platter of 9 different bite size items (1. salmon on egg york, one of my favorites, it just smelts in your mouth; 2. flash fried asparagus, one of the all time favorites at raku; 3. duck skewer which is tender and perfectly seasons)\n\nhighlight 2: course 3 - the dish came in a white ceramic box with a floral design on the lid.  it was perfected wrapped and presented. when it was served, i felt like a kid on christmas morning waiting to open my present.  inside the box, it was a piece of super fresh and delicious tofu.  the tofu was paired/garnished with ikura (salmon roe) and fresh green tea powder.  i was never a fan of ikura but the ikura here was super fresh. the cold and silky tofu was enhance by the ikura, which was like a burst of fresh and cold liquid with a faint hint of the sea and it was mixed with the slightly sweet yet dry green tea powder... i don't know how to better describe it except to tell you it was heavenly...\n\nhighlight 3: dobin mushi (tea pot soup) - the soup is literally cooked in a tea pot filled with a piece of chicken, a piece of fish, mushroom, and 2 ginko beans.  this is a very traditional japanese soup. this dish is seasonal because of the special type of mushroom (i don't remember what it is called).  i enjoyed the soup, although i thought a small piece of lime would enhance the flavor further (plus thats the way i've always had it in asia).\n\nhighlight 4: flute & blue fin tuna - it was sooo cute that i cried a little... for the fact that it was so heavenly and for the fact that my children will probably not have a chance to experience this deliciousness \n\nhighlight 5: glazed chicken thigh.  i don't remember what the chicken thigh was glazed with, but it tasted like it was brined and then boiled.  the chicken was sliced into thin slices and garnished with two roman tomatoes.  it is the most perfectly cooked, juicy, and tender chicken i've ever had!  the chicken was serviced with a reduction sauce.. it was so good that my friends licked their plates!!!\n\nhighlight 6: <mark>Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard</mark> - omg if there's food in heaven... this would be it!  the dish was served in a whole egg shell with the top sliced off leaving a little opening big enough for you to dig your little spoon into it to spoon out a mouthful of yumminess.  there is a small piece of foie gras on top of the custard... i wish there were more...  :-9\n\nhighlight 7: uni shooter (this is my favorite!!!  you must have this when you visit raku).  the dish is served in a martini glass and it was soo fantastically delicious!  there were small pieces of different things... (i know i'm not describing it well) but all the textures and flavor.. it was seriously a party in my mouth!!!\n\nhighlight 8: kobe beef covered with garlice slices on a hot stone flambed with xo.  the meat was tender and sweet.  i was afraid that the meat was going to be tough being on the hot stone and having it flambed in front of me, but to my surprise, it was perfectly cooked.  the xo and the garlic nicely seasoned and caramelized the beef when flambed while the hot stone brown the meat on the other side.  to die for!\n\nthere were a few dishes that i was not overly impressed about (scoring 7.5 out of 10 versus 10 out of 10), but over all, the entire meal was great.\n\nwe had a different sake for every 3 dishes.  we started with a sparkling sake, it was almost like a sweet sparking wine. it was very yummy... i like my sake dry, so i would have loved it at the end of the saiseki.\n\nthe service was great.  we had our own private room and it really enhanced the ambiance.  the service was great.  the server describes each dish carefully.  he provided information on the food, how it was cooked, where certain items were from, which made the dish unique, as well as how to eat them (for example of the tofu dish in highlight 2 to take each bite of the tofu by dipping it in the green tea powder along with a ikura to create the optimal experience).\n\nour reservation was at 8:00pm and we did not finish dinner until 3 and half hours later at 11:30. it was a great experience and i would highly recommended for special occasions since i got a little sticker shocked when i got the bill for $350 for just my share =d", 
            "thank you, raku, for such a delightful dinner, though it would probably be more suitable to describe it as a wonderful experience. everything from your great service to dish presentation to flavor was impeccable.  \n\nthe meal started with a wonderful <mark>Sashimi Salad</mark>.  the sashimi pieces were big and the dressing was uniquely good.  then came the homemade tofu, which had great texture and the homemade soy sauce and sauces complemented it well.  my favorite condiment was the green tea salt with the tofu.\n\nthe robata items were perfectly cooked.  the bacon you use to wrap around the mushrooms, asparagus wasn't too salty as is the usual problem for me at other robata restaurants.   the enoki was cooked to a chewy perfection, as was the pork cheek, beef tendon, shishito, chicken wings.  \n\nof all the items, i think i loved the <mark>Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard</mark> the most.  the texture, the taste, and the presentation.  \n\nthe oden soup base was refreshing and you can add items to it a la carte.  we opted for the daikon, chikuwa, bean curd with mochi inside, and uni (which comes separately with wakame).  the meal was ended delightfully with a grilled onigiri in broth.  perfect ending to a perfect meal.  thank you!\n\nps.  the bathroom is also super nice.  love the aquarium!!", 
            "delicious! my husband and i had been trying to eat here for the last 3 years but we either would for get the name or forget to make reservations. we celebrated our 2nd yr anniversary and it was definitely special. i like to describe it as japanese tapas, super fresh and yummy! here are the definite must haves:\n*<mark>Crispy Fried Shrimp</mark> as an appetizer you get about 8 and they are great!\n*kobe beef outside skirt with garlic\n*kobe beef fillet with wasabi- the wasabi is super taste and not harsh at all\n*butter saut\\u00e9ed scallop with soy sauce- get your own you wont want to share this was our #1 pick\n*portabella stuffed with ground chicken-\n*udon noodle with <mark>Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard</mark> soup- creamy and delicious definite worth the price. \n\nthe staff is so nice they explain things very well and don't leave with out checking out their bathrooms, they are awesome)", 
            "my wife and i began our 10 year anniversary weekend with visit to raku as we drove into vegas at 1:45 am on friday night (saturday morning, actually).  fortunately for us, the kitchen was making its last call and we still had time to order.\n\nbest dishes:\n<mark>Poached Egg</mark> with sea urchin (salmon roe, jalapeno, mushrooms, mountain root in soba broth served cold) - amazing well constructed with a perfectly <mark>Poached Egg</mark> and various layers of flavor that all worked together.  a bargain at $9.\nfoie gras chawanmushi (<mark>Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard</mark> with a hint of foie gras, smoked duck and black truffle) - creamy, rich, delicious!  $10\n<mark>Juicy Deep Fried Chicken</mark> (six medallions of chicken, fried, over a bed of baby spinach) - we weren't going to order this, but our waitress highly recommended it, and we're glad she did. $9\nenoki mushroom with bacon - great flavor from the grill and a thick, lean, juicy cut of bacon. $2.80 for two.\nkamo grilled duck (with balsamic soy sauce) - tender, well seasoned, and not gamey at all.\n\ngood dishes:  <mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark>, momo chicken thigh, grilled veal\n\ndisappointing:  kobe beef with wasabi (surprisingly ordinary), tontoro kurobuta pork cheek (too fatty for our taste), <mark>Sashimi Salad</mark> (expected more from raku)\n\nregarding some topics raised by other reviewers:\nprice.  we thought the prices were quite reasonable for a restaurant of this quality.\nservice.  for the most part, the wait staff was pleasant and informative.  they were not very attentive - we did have to ask for refills, etc.  but, because the restaurant was small and not crowded, it was fairly easy to get their attention.\n\noverall, this was a great meal and a fantastic way to start our 10th anniversary weekend.", 
            "i have heard that they have started a kaiseki course, so i have been curious and wanting to try it out, but given that my last experience here was merely a-ok, i have dragged my feet until recently, but here are my thoughts after trying it out.  \n\nfirst of all, kaiseki literally means \"stone in the bosom\".  this originates from zen buddhist monks keeping a warmed stone in the bosom to endure cold and hunger during their training as they were not allowed to eat much in the afternoon.  occasionally they are allowed to eat small portions of rice poridge, and such small meals originated the name \"kaiseki\", as something to wade off hunger.\n\nkaiseki then transformed to offerings during formal tea ceremonies, and then after hundreds of years it has evolved  into what we consider kaiseki ryori now, which is a multi course formal dinner offered almost eclusively in ryoutei,  as it inherits a spirit of the tea ceremony, the focus is on service and offering the best that can be offered at the time to serve the customer, the spirit of \"ichigo ichie\".  \n\nas i consider raku as sort of a high-end izakaya like place, and certainly not a ryoutei, i was curious as to how they can pull off a kaiseki course, but here is how it went.  i had to make the reservation at least 3 days in advance, and the choices were 10 or 15-course dinner, and i was told to expect it to take at least 3 hours.  as i had to arrange for a baby sitter, i just went for a 10 course meal.\n\nin japan, ryoutei or high-end japanese restaurant (something like kiccho comes to mind) serves their guests in private tatami rooms, which isn't quite possible here, but at least they led us to a private room-like space toward the back of the restaurant, which is nice.  it was walled off except for the entrance part, so it is a bit more than a booth to give us some privacy.\n\nwe ordered some bottled water from japan as well as a small bottle of sake as my wife and i don't drink that much, and the course started with yuzu flavored sake aperitif and then:\n1) hotaruika (firefly squid) sumiso-ae\n2) large plate with <mark>Crispy Asparagus Okaki</mark>, salmon with egg yolk, corn/potato, grilled egg plant, grilled duck, yamaimo mousse, and fois <mark>Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard</mark>.  \n3) squid and ikura with uni sauce\n4) soup with chicken tsukune and cherry blossom leaf\n5) sashimi of hatsu-gatsuo (early season bonito) and sayori (japanese half beak)\n6) miso glazed grilled huedai (star snapper)\n7) fried aji (japanese jack mackerel) in dashi with eringi mushrooms\n8) baby abalone\n9) kobe beef steak on hot stone\n10) shima aji namerou with rice and takana (striped jack tartar).\n11) desert of fresh cheese mousse \n\nwhew!!  it sounds like a lot, and it is a lot, but that took us more than 3 hours.  was it good?  yes.  am i thrilled to go back and try it again?  no.  \n\nperhaps that is the reason why i live here and despite all the raves i hear and read about raku, this was my second visit.  \n\ni just think that it was a strech (to say it nicely) to call it kaiseki.  there are a few things that bothered me and distracted from the meal.  \n\nthere was a group of young kids wearing baseball caps, with baggy shorts and wife beaters talking very loudly, dropping f-bombs left and right who were sitting relatively close to us.  although we were in a semi-private booth-like space, this was distracting.  do i blame them?  no, because as i said before, i consider raku to be a high-end izakaya, and not a ryotei.  however, this is not quite the setting that i find appropriate to serve kaiseki, which has zen buddhism and tea ceremony in origin.  it has to be in a serene, zen-like space, and raku is not it.\n\nin any kaiseki, there must be a balance of food from sea/land/mountain.  as you can see on the menu, 7 out of the 10 ingredients are seafood and the balance is hopelessly lacking.\n\none of the very important aspects of serving kaiseki food is \"ma\" or spacing.  3 and a half hours for this meal?  my wife and i felt that this meal dragged way, way too long, and the consideration for ma was absolutely lacking.\n\none other concern was that my wife has a food allergy to shrimps/clams.  i was actually surprised that they didn't ask me that when i made the reservation and i forgot to mention it, but when i mentioned it at dinner, i was told that \"oh, we don't do kaiseki for people with allergies\"....i told them that's ok, as i will be happy to eat her shrimps and clams, and the only thing that she couldn't eat happened to be abalone, no big deal.  however, this strays so so far away from the spirit of kaiseki which should inherit the spirit of \"ichigo-ichie\", which is at the heart of sadou, or tea ceremony as well a zen buddhism.  \n\nin summary, i have a very difficult time calling this meal \"kaiseki\".  the food was good although not exactly \"great\" either, and kaiseki is not only about the food, but more importantly the experience, and as a whole, the experience was lacking and it was not something that i am yearning to go back for more.", 
            "the chefs of today may well be the van goghs of our time. the care and precision of modern food presentation has made some of the creations on our plates incredible edible works of art.\n\nthe japanese have the art of food presentation imbued in their food culture and they really put their heart and soul into making their food a feast for the eyes as well as the stomach.\n\non my visit to las vegas last september, i was starting to feel a bit jaded about eating at the big corporate named restaurants on the strip and sought out a dinner spot more in keeping with being a locals' favourite. a yelp search threw up raku and a quick check with local yelp friend emily r confirmed that it was one of her favourite spots in town.\n\ni was especially drawn to their kaiseki menu, where they create a unique menu based on the best ingredients available that day. a quick phone call secured  my dinner reservation and as requested on their website, i pre-ordered the kaiseki menu.\n\nmy taxi dropped outside raku, which is located in a non-descipt small off-strip mall. any initial fears about the unprepossessing surroundings were soon dispelled by the warm welcome i received on entering the restaurant. there was a general hubbub of conviviality in the restaurant all evening with many customers obviously being happy regulars.\n\ni bagged a seat at my favourite place to sit in a restaurant - at the counter watching the chefs at work. i was able to chat to the main chef all evening, who was very happy to engage and explain things to me about my unfolding gastronomic adventure.\n\nevery dish was a work of art and there were quite a few new flavours for my palate to savour.\n\n1. mounta<mark>Veggie Pork Intestine In Pot</mark> croquettes in dashi broth\n\n2. eight mini treasures, including creations such as tofu skin with wasabi and egg with sashimi\n\n3. the house signature homemade silken tofu with salmon roe and homemade green tea salt and soya sauce\n\n4. fluke sashimi and liver with spring radish and grated onion dipped <mark>Veggie Pork Intestine In Pot</mark> sauce\n\n5. japanese/spanish mackarel marinated in yuzu\n\n6. foie gras/<mark>Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard</mark>/summer truffle served in an egg shell\n\n7. eel with shisho pepper\n\n8. uni with egg\n\n9. kobe beef on hot rock flamed with hennessy xo sauce\n\n10. mixed tuna over rice\n\n11. panna cota\n\nas you can see, the list of ingredients is like a who's who of the best ingredients to pass one's lips. everything was a delight to eat.\n\n i love the way that japanese cookery has given exquisite food presentation to the west but in return, the has given them ingredients like foie gras to cook with.\n\nservice was always with a smile all evening.\n\nthe final touch of class came at the end of my meal when the chef confessed that normally, they don't do the kaiseki menu for only one person due to the large amount of prep time involved but as i was visiting from london, they made an exception.\n\narigato, aburiya raku!", 
            "i ate at raku at the recommendation of my friend ryan.  raku is located off spring mountain road in chinatown. let me start by saying that this place has amazing food. we arrived promptly at around midnight but didnt actually get seated til about 12:30am or so.  it would have been five stars had their service been better. \n\nwe started with a salad of some sort, which was fresh and marinaded and was delightful.  we then had the iberico carpaccio, which had the iberico with a layer of gelatinous fat on top and melts away when you eat it.  it was one of the highlights of the night. it was a special so when we tried to order it again later that night, it was sold out. \nthe <mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark> was delicious. soft tofu with a good broth that provides the tofy with alot of flavor.  <mark>Poached Egg</mark> with sea urchin was a hit, it includes <mark>Poached Egg</mark>, sea urchin, okra, mushrooms, salmon roe, in a broth. kobe beef filet was tender and the wasabi touch was the right amount of spice to the kobe beef. the chicken teba wing had a good crust and was tender and flavorful.  the toro tataki was soft and buttery and was fantastic but we had gotten the last order.  the pork cheek was fatty and full of flavor.  the negitoro was ok and didnt blow me away like most of the other dishes.  <mark>Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard</mark> was excellent.", 
            "nom nom nom raku is probably one of the best japanese restaurants in town.\n\nif you consider yourself a foodie, you must check out this spot. it is an avant garde japanese restaurant unlike anything else in town. there is no ayce sushi, or sake machine like you find in other restaurants. instead, you find a small cozy eatery tucked away on the western part of chinatown.\n\n the food is minimalistic but delicious. the chef makes his own soy sauce and tofu which is practically unheard of at most japanese restaurants. there is quite a bit of skewers = \"meat on a stick\" which is totally not a bad thing. the bacon wrapped enoki mushrooms are a must try. the <mark>Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard</mark> udon noodle soup is unlike anything i have ever tried. the texture, taste, and quality is something you find at a high-end restaurant on the strip. similar dishes have been done before but not like this. they offer a large selection of sake which is a often necessary addition to any proper japanese meal.\n\nmore and more people are discovering raku which usually means that lines and wait times can be long on the weekends. the place is pretty small so the amount of diners is definitely limited. on top of that raku can get very pricey. top-shelf ingredients like foie gras, sea urchin, and caviar command higher prices.", 
            "raku was a unique experience for our family.  we love sushi and japanese cuisine in general but this was on another level.\n\nit is very pricey but that is to be expected for the freshness and presentation of their food.  we had numerous dishes but some of our favorites were the fois <mark>Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard</mark>, the grilled duck, and the yellowtail sashimi.",

            "loved the foie gras yakitori (since ca banned it, this is heaven!), age tofu was out of this world and they made the tofu in house fresh, topped with ikura <mark>Sunomono - Cucumber And Seaweed</mark> and the broth was just nice, not too salty or sweet. very delicate! <mark>Poached Egg</mark> with sea urchin and ikura was very tasty and super duper fresh! chicken teba wing was juicy and crispy on the outside, nice. kurobuta pork cheek was the best, tender and not too salty, and crispy. oden was just ok, i had better one. the butter sauteed scallop with soy sauce was devine (a bit small for $7). we came at 11:30 midnight because they were super small and busy. a lot of items were sold out, so bummed. we wanted to try the <mark>Juicy Deep Fried Chicken</mark>, <mark>Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard</mark>, kobe beef tongue, oyakodon, green soba, the little hot pot on small fire stove, and <mark>Crispy Fried Shrimp</mark>. oh, they had 2 bathrooms, the prettiest i have ever seen! the sea ocean theme with aquarium and nice ocean ceiling, lighting and wall, and nice bedat seat. the other bathroom was a jungle theme with rose petals, big tree trunk and leaves flowers ceiling, with bird chipping music, so soothing! a definite must try in vegas!!!!", 
            "great spot -- definitely worth a short trip from the strip.\n\ni had pretty high expectations going on, but those expectations were actually exceeded. there are so many dishes that i would still love to come back and try, but my favorites were:\n\nuni with salmon roe and <mark>Poached Egg</mark>\n<mark>Yellowtail Carpaccio</mark>\nkobe filet with wasabi\nudon with <mark>Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard</mark>\noyakodon\n\nthe hot and cold tofus were also excellent. \n\nprices are very reasonable given the quality.\n\ncall in advance for reservations!",

            "we did the 15 course kaiseki with premium sake and water pairings.\nmind-blowing doesn't even encompass the greatness of this meal. i'd put this in the top 5 meals of my life. the kaiseki is seasonal and changes, so i won't bother going into all the details... and my pictures were dim and blurry due to lighting, so i'm a bit embarrassed. the service was wonderful. we were seated in a small private room with a paper screen door. two servers served us and seemed available at a moments notice any time. the pairings were phenomenal, but i will say opting for as much sake as we did was probably a bit excessive. another note: unless you really are capable of doing the 15 courses you need to be prepared to either not eat all of some of the latter courses, or have an immense appetite. i consider myself someone who has a pretty big appetite (i've been known to do multiple tasting dinners in one night and then go for late night snacks afterwords), but this was just... too much. when i go back i'll probably either opt for the 10 course, or pace myself and remember i can't possibly finish everything. the last several meat courses were basically about 1/2 the size of full sized entrees. i would also ask to skip the hot sake pairing as that i simply do not enjoy hot sake, period. the owner came and met us and talked for a while, out server translated, and he was so happy and friendly he walked us to the cab and bowed to us as we drove away. fantastic experience. i believe pairings were equal to the cost of the meal per person, so it ended up around $300/pp ++. well worth it.\n\nhighlights: \"kobe\" beef cooked on a stone and flamb\\u00e9ed with cognac, <mark>Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard</mark>, beef tendon, agadashi tofu (perhaps the 2nd best dish), yuba (tofu skin) with uni <mark>Veggie Pork Intestine In Pot</mark> (imo the best dish of the night), cold house tofu.\n\nyou could also go and just do ala carte izakaya style grilled meats and be sublimely happy. the binchotan charcoal and charred meats on skewers is also a wonderful experience. raku is an amazing place. you can spend a lot, or a little and its all just what you want out of it, but be sure it will not disappoint. \n\nvery highly recommended.", 
            "this little plaza off the strip is a real gem.  we came to this plaza twice during our trip and also hit up kabuto for sushi.  check out my review here: \n\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz/kabuto-las-vegas#hrid:amqnghz303ggdnb2u9fg_q\n\nafter this trip, i'm really going to focus on finding great restaurants off the strip since there are so many great restaurants at much more reasonable prices off the strip.\n\nraku is a fancy take on a traditional izakaya and is some of the best representation of the genre that i've had.  service was attentive, even though it took a little bit for them to warm up and get our orders going.  \n\nwe shared a number of dishes and that's really the only way to eat at a place like this.  order a bunch of small plates and robata yaki items and just indulge.  some of the highlights for me in no particular order were:\n\n- housemade tofu (both cold and <mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark> styles)\n- pork cheek skewer (a great alternative to the typical pork belly as this has more of an even marbling making)\n\n- sukiyaki with australian a5 wagyu  (there was only 3 ounces of the wagyu and that is really all was needed.  the slices were served cooking gently in the pot and were ready to eat within seconds.  with the fat content of the a5, it really doesn't hurt to have it just cooked through because you do want that fat to melt in your mouth.  normally i would never let my beef slices get past a pink/medium.)\n\n- foie skewer with soy glaze (the glaze was a bit too much for my taste, but coming from california, i'll take all the foie i can get)\n\na couple of items weren't as exciting, but that is what makes the small plates format of an izakaya so nice because you are bound to find something you like.  the tsukune and <mark>Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard</mark> were a bit disappointing.  the tsukune definitely lacked flavor, but was very tender considering it was pure ground white meat chicken.  i will judge all tsukune by those served by shinsengumi in la and this was definitely a cut below.  the <mark>Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard</mark> sounded like it should be a hit, but sadly lacked foie flavor and wasn't as delicate as most good chawanmushis.\n\nall in all, this is definitely a recommended detour from the strip.  you aren't going to get food like this at a reasonable price on the strip.  be sure to make reservations well ahead and get yourself out here.", 
            "this was by far one of the best meals i've ever had in vegas!  it was one of the first times i've ever gone off the strip for a meal and i'm sure glad i did.  the service was outstanding (our waitress was so sweet!), the food was spectacular, and we had a very private table in the back which made our experience so nice.\n\nwe relied heavily on other yelpers in our ordering so we were impressed, like others, with the angeldesh (sp?) tofu, kobe beef skewers, <mark>Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard</mark>, seared foie gras, and something else that had uni, ikura, egg, mushrooms, and more -- that last dish might not be a great choice for a food newbie, but if you love adventurous weird food then you should definitely try it!  \n\nall in all, a fantastic meal that rivaled even some of the best meals i had while travelling in japan last year.  i will definitely be back, raku!", 
            "amazing restaurant! everything was fresh and unique.  i was impressed by everything on their menu.  first of all, since it's been almost a year since foie gras was banned in california, of course that jumped off their menu, and was the first thing that i wanted to order.  but there were so many other mouth watering dishes!  good thing there were 4 of us in our group, so we could order practically everything!\n\ndefinitely check out their daily specials.  there's going to be something terrific on there.  the day i went, we ordered:\n- grilled alaskan king crab\n- uni udon - a must have if you like uni!!!!!!\n- blue fin tuna sashimi\n\nitems on their regular menu that we had:\n- <mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark>: fresh tofu, and served in a whole block\n- <mark>Sashimi Salad</mark>: ridiculously fresh sashimi!\n- <mark>Yellowtail Carpaccio</mark>\n- <mark>Poached Egg</mark> with uni and salmon roe\n- <mark>Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard</mark>\n- kobe beef fillet with wasabi: we had to order this with all of the reviews that mentioned it, but it didn't live up to the hype. :( good but not phenomenal.\n- kurobata pork cheek : a must order!\n- duck with balsamic soy sauce: very tasty!\n- butter sauteed scallop with soy sauce\n- enoki mushroom wrapped with bacon\n- japanese shishito peppers\n\nto finish off an amazing meal, we had to have dessert.  the green tea creme brulee was the perfect way to end the meal!\n\ni never knew about raku before, but i am raving about it now.  i won't be able to take a vegas trip without stopping by, now.", 
            "if there is ever such thing as near perfect restaurant, raku would be it. the staff were extremely friendly. the food is all fairly priced. i love the variety of their foei gras creation, but i have to say that my favourite was the steam <mark>Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard</mark> foei gras!!! great presentation!! the food tastes as good as it looks. normally i hate the white meat chicken breast. however, the chef at raku somehow manage to make the tough white meant into soft and mellow meat. i definitely fell in love with this place. the only downside to this place is that you have to get a reservation and the food is kinda slow. but i am willing to overlook these cons as the food make up for them. so 5 stars!!!!", 
            "i remember the first time i visited which was at least a year or two ago. i was with a small group of friends and we decided to try what seemed to be a tasting menu with a sake pairing with each course. this roughly ran us around $100 a person, but definitely well worth it!\n \nmost recently as my second time, it was pricey for small tapas portions but none the less it was just as wonderful as the first besides no longer offering the sake pairing.. no worries though i didn't allow me to get discouraged. i did however noticed they still offered the chef special tasting menu - $75/$100 - the price difference is based on \"quality\" of food. instead we decided to order off the menu using previous reviews as a guide.\n\nwarning tip* \nbe careful of the board the server brings to the table with no prices. they are \"specials\" especially for your wallet...a small sized cooked sea bass filet - $25, and kanpachi sashimi $23. if your willing to pay, i say go for it but don't be surprised when you see your bill at the end. \n\ni first ordered a refreshing citrusy 750ml bottle of sake for the table - $55. pricey and delishious. i later found out it has a lower alcohol content too. (probably wouldn't order again; however it was nice to taste and try)\n\nthe kobe beef filet skewers are a must! - $12ea (a little steep but i guess quality over quantity), <mark>Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard</mark> was delish - $12 , <mark>Yellowtail Carpaccio</mark> was decent however nothing different than what you can get at any sushi bar in town - $12, enoki mushroom wrapped in bacon was a pleaser for me however not for my other guests (i personally love mushrooms) - $3, half <mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark> was a must try because it was raved as being fresh and homemade (no disappointment there) - $7.50, scallop w/soy sauce was tender and not over cooked (unfortunately there was only one piece) - $7.00, we decided to try kobe beef liver sashimi...texture and all were definitely not my cup of tea. at least i can say i've tried it once and only once.\n\nfor dessert we ordered fluffy cheesecake (by far my favorite) yum! - $6, green tea creme br\\u00fbl\\u00e9e and a strawberry sorbet (both were alright) \nend of the meal the bill was - $275 for four plus a 20% tip. \n\noverall, it met my high expectations as before, with their ambiance, quality of food and my own personal tastebud experience. this place is definitely a hidden vegas treasure off the strip.", 
            "we walked in around midnight without a reservation and got seated in 5 minutes. i really didn't do much research before going there. it was recommended to me as a \"sushi\" place. um, they don't do sushi. no nigiri at all. just the most beautiful sashimi (yes, in the middle of the desert, how do they do that?!) we've ever had. we had the yellow tail carpaccio. we also had <mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark>, rice cakes (soy sauce and wasabi flavored), and every fois gras dish they had on the menu. it was all spectacular. the grilled fois gras was perfect, the rice in the fois gras don was like no other rice i've ever had and the fois <mark>Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard</mark> was a work of art. so delicious, the custard is infused with fois gras and topped with tidbits of rare duck breast. it made for the best midnight snack we've ever had. next time we will make reservations and have the kobe feef skewers.", 
            "no doubt, one of the best meals i have ever had!\n\n\n--started off with the <mark>Poached Egg</mark> with sea urchin and salmon roe.  personally, i am a big fan of uni so i had to get this dish.  i thought it was great but the sliminess especially when mixed altogether with nameko mushrooms and okras definitely took a little getting used to.  only if there were more texture to counter the offputting consistency, this dish would have been excellent.\n\n--next was <mark>Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard</mark>.  this dish was really interesting since i have never had foie gras integrated with <mark>Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard</mark> before.  the taste is on point with that creamy foie gras texture one would look for.  i decided to give the duck topping to my girl since i annihilated the robata grilled duck.  she said i missed out and should order another so that i could give it a try.\n\n--their <mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark> received rave reviews so we decided to give it a try.  the dish itself has great flavors and the fact that it is homemade makes it that much better!\n\n--also ordered a couple items from their robata grill menu:  \nkobe beef fillet with wasabi [alright]\nkobe beef liver [good]\nkurobuta pork cheek [really good]\npork ear [good]\nduck with balsamic soy sauce [life changing]\n\n--ended the meal with green tea cr\\u00e8me brul\\u00e9e and hot tea.\n\n\noverall experience?  raku is definitely one of the top contenders for japanese cuisine in las vegas.  i enjoyed how great the service was especially since their employees were friendly and helpful--explained everything regarding the restaurant's menu and other daily specials.  as far as the ambiance goes, dining at this place made me feel as if i were actually at a restaurant in japan while eating some really great authentic japanese cuisine.  the restaurant itself is quite small so make sure you make a reservation.  i would certainly come back to try some of their off-menu dishes and maybe even try their \"omakase\" menu.  oh yea, did anybody else notice that huge tree in the bathroom?! ha", 
            "this place is becoming popular with foodie tourists visiting vegas. make sure to make a reservation. speaking of reservations, the food here is very... reserved. \n\nbecause of our large party, they requested we have a kaiseki (set course of small dishes.) with each dish, you get one item, say, a tofu dish, a tiny bit of garnish, and sometimes a seasoning. the dishes are simple, giving the chef nowhere to hide poor ingredients or poor technique.\n\nthat said, this \"pure\" style of cooking is not for everyone. for example, i found the hokkaido hairy crab very fresh, but delicate, lacking in flavor compared to dungeness, rock or blue. it was served steamed with no sauce.\n\ni've had kaiseki in japan, where the dishes are also simply prepared, but with much more detail to flavor combinations: for example, a simple mushroom dish would come with 1 large bean and one vegetable in a simple sauce. but together, they made the dish. simple but complex.\n\nat least with the kaiseki at raku don't expect to be wowed: it's just too simple. however, some of the stuff on the regular menu looked much more interesting: uni in <mark>Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard</mark>, for example.",

            "since my initial visit during their first year opened, i've been back a handful of times and felt it was time i updated my review.  \n\nraku is the kind of place we usually reserve for special occasions and recommend to out of town guests.  our most recent visit was only last week as the husband and i celebrated our five year wedding anniversary.\n\nwe attempted to make reservations on the same day and the only opening they had was at 9:00 pm.  we did a walk in to hopefully land a cancellation spot or two of the coveted five counter seats, and it was only a 30 minute wait for the counter seats!  sweet!  but yes, make reservations way in advance, especially if you have a larger party or it's a weekend.\n\nthe thing to look out for is the specials board.  they usually list about 5-6 items on there that range from raw to cooked items.  the weirdest part about this board is that it will change during your visit there.  during our 2-3 hour dinner, we saw some things sell out and get replaced with something else.  the waitstaff doesn't mention the newer items, so it's something you just have to look out for.  (for example, oysters were not listed on the specials board but the party sitting next to us ended up ordering the last giant oyster.  they were seated after us and only knew about it because the oyster was sitting on ice right in front of them!  they had squid on ice too, but it wasn't listed on the specials board!)  so, not only are you keeping your eyes out for the changing specials board but you have to see what's fresh and on ice that day!  we do get a few cooked items and although they are good, the raw fish choices are always the best!\n\nthese days we skip the robata grill items, not because they aren't tasty but we like to focus on the more unique items.  \n\none of our most favorite items is the <mark>Crispy Asparagus Okaki</mark> ($5).  it's a simple asparagus that's been dredged in rice crackers and deep-fried.  i don't know why it's so good but it just is.  and when you add a little of their matcha salt, oh my gawd!  i just love it.\n\nanother item we had on this last visit include the <mark>Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard</mark> ($10).  there's a piece of duck that lays on top of this dish, and it's actually duck liver they use, not goose.  the foie gras is already mixed in with the egg, so it gives the whole dish a rich egg taste.  \n\n<mark>Poached Egg</mark> with sea urchin and salmon roe ($9) is another unusual pairing, mostly because of the mountain yam that gives this dish a slimy texture.  you break up the egg and mix it all together, but you can't help but notice the slimy effect from the mountain yam.  it's a tasty nonetheless.  \n\nthe kobe beef liver sashimi ($9.50) is something that not everyone would enjoy.  the husband isn't usually a fan of liver, except served foie gras style, but he was game.  and it did still lend a livery taste, but it's something that you have to try once.\n\ni always enjoy homemade tofu and raku's tofu (whole $5.50) does not disappoint.  they server theirs with bonito shavings, ginger, and scallions.\n\nthe four condiments placed on every table should not go ignored, especially the green tea salt and their own soy sauce.  yum!\n\nsince they expanded, their bathrooms are indeed something to look at.  first off, it's so clean and pristine and holds one of the cleanest fish tanks you'll ever see on spring mountain! \n\nservice on our last few visits have been much better compared to my first visit.  the waitress that took care of us at the counter never let my water glass go empty and she was always letting us know when our food was coming so we weren't waiting too long and giving us clean plates too.\n\nmy only real gripe was this: although i usually love sitting at the counter so i can watch the chefs at work, i also can't overlook things that probably shouldn't be seen by dining guests.  one of the prep guys at the counter sneezed into his hands and continued prepping the food.  i was totally turned off by this, especially because there was a sink right behind him.  it wasn't too long after when the husband said to me that we weren't going to be ordering anymore cold foods.  when i inquired as to why, he said he noticed the same prep guy just cough into his hands and continue working.  yes, a sneeze and cough into the very bare hands that were prepping the food.  yuck.\n\nnonetheless, we still do love raku and would continue recommending it.  but alas, those basic hygiene issues need to be addressed!  \n\n4.5 stars.", 
            "my third visit to raku was a completely different experience than my last two visits in that this was my first time coming here solo.  because of this, i wasn't able to order as much food since i had no one to share around.  however, from what i ordered during this trip, it was plenty enough to still impress and satisfy me.\n\n<mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark> -- http://bit.ly/1favknu\nthe first two times i visited i had tried their housemade raku tofu and had been amazed by it both times.  so this time i ordered it agedashi style because for one thing, it looks awesome in the photos, and the other is that everything is elevated to awesomer status when it's deep fried.\n\n<mark>Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard</mark> -- http://bit.ly/1h53vde\nyou didn't think i was gonna leave raku, or all of vegas, without getting my foie gras fix since it's banned in my home state of ca.  i had this dish last time i went to raku, but the big difference with this visit is that i got to have this all to myself......bwahahahah!\n\nwagyu sukiyaki -- http://bit.ly/iihiyx\nthis was on the no.1 item on the top of their specials board.  that meant that they wanted you to order it!  like most of the items on the board there is no price listed so you know you're gonna fork up the dollars.  i've never had grade a5 wagyu before so this was my splurge of my entire trip.\n\nthe sukiyaki is cooked right in front of you on top of a bed of their special smoke free charcoal (http://bit.ly/iihcaz).  took about 5 mins to cook.\n\nthere's a lot going on with this pot, first you have the a5 wagyu on top, and underneath all that goodness, you have the housemade raku tofu with clear noodles and veggies.  the trippy part for me was that they give you a raw egg in a small bowl with which you must crack and beat to use for dipping sauce for the beef.  this may be sensitive to some folks, but i had good faith in their product so i went with it and it actually went well with the wagyu beef.  the only minor caveat i had with this dish was that the sukiyaki broth was a little too much on the sweet side.  but that is a really minor complaint because i totally enjoyed this dish.  at $45, for probably the most expensive sukiyaki i've ever had, it was worth every penny!!\n\nraku has done it again to impress me with their top notch service and incredible food.  it has shown me that whether you come in with a group or dine in solo, you'll have an awesome experience no matter what!!  i'll be back again soon!!!", 
            "we ordered the following items:\nyellow tail sashimi special\n<mark>Ken Salad</mark>\nhouse-made tofu\ngrilled rice balls\nkobe beef fillet with wasabi\npork cheek\nbacon wrapped enoki\ngreen tea creme brulee\n<mark>Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard</mark>\nbrown sugar plum sake\n\na lot of these items are new to me and i think they are greatly designed and well executed. the pork cheek tastes really good, tender, juicy/fatty and full of flavor. bacon wrapped enoki is pretty good too, but as it is somewhat quite common and am item hard to mess up. i did not have the sashimi, but i was told it was good. i was told the brown sugar plum sake is one of the best. the <mark>Ken Salad</mark> is well balanced and i like the combinations. the house-made tofu is creamy and smooth. the green tea creme brulee is very tasty as well. \n\nthe cons i can think of include\nthe foie gras is somewhat chewy and tough for some reason. but the egg definitely has good flavor and very tender. \nthe koke beef is somewhat stringy and grainy. i was expect something more juicy and tender. the amount of wasabi is probably too much as well. it overpowers the beef and i can not talk or open my eyes for probably two minutes. \nthe entire restaurant is very compact and one table of guests have been talking very loudly over some not very classy topics. but i guess there is nothing you can do about it.\n\noverall, i like their food. the price is definitely in the $$$ category. two of us spend $140 on the dinner.", 
            "raku is without a doubt my favorite restaurant in vegas. there are definitely hit and miss dishes in terms of giving 5 stars but overall i've always walked away very pleased eating here. the catch is you must come with at least 4 people that way you can get a feel of the most dishes. their menu is a bit overwhelming even for a seasoned japanese food eater. \n\nwhat i always get and blows me away every time, the chilled udon with <mark>Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard</mark> soup. it's insanely good in many levels: texture, temperature, flavor, and serious umami. \n\ninteresting enough their kanpachi sashimi is the best i've had. it's served chilled and has great texture and flavor.", 
            "oh las vegas izakaya places close at 3am. that's so awesome, since i didn't have time to eat until 11:30pm. this is a solid 4.5.\n\ni didn't even notice this place when i went to monta ramen next time. but how awesome to have two yummy shops in the same small outdoor plaza. \n\ni bookedmarked this place a few months ago and was looking for a snack at 11:30pm. good thing this place opens so late. no wait for bar seating on late  thursday night. reviewed the menu and chose a few snacks.\n\nchicken thigh $2.75 for 1 skewer [5 of 5] - delicious and <mark>Juicy Deep Fried Chicken</mark> meat. very tender and had this nice charcoal smell. it was perfectly roasted. \nkurobuta pork cheek $4.25 for 1 skewer [5 of 5] - delicious and juicy pork meat. the slice of roast meat was sensational.\nkobe beef tendon $3.50 for 1 skewer [4 of 5] - first time having roast tendon and it was delicious. the charrrrr taste and gooey tendon was wonderful. it is a little different from the typical meats, but worth trying. i really enjoyed it, but i also enjoy tendon.\nudon noodle with <mark>Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard</mark> soup $18 [4 of 5] - interesting concept. fusing the foie gras into a custard. then pouring light soy sauce into the custard to serve as the cold udon dipping sauce. i liked the idea, but the custard didn't physically work well as a dipping sauce. i think the pieces separately work better - <mark>Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard</mark> and a simple cold udon with a light and sweet dipping soy sauce. as a side note, the place used skinny udon noodle, which was very clever for dipping. \ngreen tea cr\\u00e8me brul\\u00e9e $6 [4 of 5] - presented with creme brulee and ice cream. it was matcha heaven. very enjoyable and rather delightful size for $6. \n\nthis place was cute. i wish i was more hungry so i could try more items from the menu. also, after i visited the restuarant, i saw a small clip of raku on anthony bourdain's parts unknown - las vegas. that was pretty cool. will be going back to try other dishes and skewers.", 
            "located way off the strip in an unassuming shopping center, you'd probably miss this restaurant if you blinked. luckily, the stellar reviews made in part by my fellow yelpers piqued my interest in finding this elusive favorite. now locating the place is a challenge in itself but landing a reservation is equally exhausting!\nas fate would have it, i landed a 9pm dining reservation. woot! little did i know, however, that a reservation merely meant when you arrived, you'd be relegated to waiting an additional 10-15minutes for your seat. \nthat being said, i took the opportunity to park it at the sidebar to glance over the extensive menu while guzzling down a bottle of asahi with shots of chilled nigori. \nhonestly, by the time i was seated, i was about three sheets to the wind! i know, i'm a cheap date.\n\nnow onto the food shall we?\n\ni went with the server's recommendations as well as my seasoned yelp buddies' choices who've had successful dining experiences here previously...\n\nnegitoro blue fin 35$ fresh and buttery slices of blue fin tuna with a cast of delectable condiments that left my taste buds doing a happy dance! trust me, the experience is virtually umami x 10! \n\nwagyu sashimi 20$ - thinly sliced filets of premium rare wagyu beef with a hint of wasabi on top and accompanied with a special savory soy dipping sauce. the first bite was like velvet on my tongue and the mouthfeel was literally like butter melting in my mouth. superb!\n\n<mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark> 7.50$ 1/2 order -a delightful dish with compelling flavors and an irresistibly soft texture that had me pining for more \n\nbutter saut\\u00e9ed scallop 7$ x2 - my favorite dish of the evening. the butter poached scallops were soft and supple with an incredibly mouthwatering garlicky flavor and fluffy texture. absolutely amazing!\n\nenoki mushroom & bacon 3$ x2 come on now, we know everything tastes better with bacon and this was no exception. just order it and thank me later.\n\nchicken wrapped chicken skin 3x2 -tender chunks of chicken breast wrapped in succulent chicken skin. an indulgent  experience that is second to none \n\n<mark>Poached Egg</mark> with sea urchin & salmon roe full cast of delectable ingredients that left my taste buds in a tailspin of delight. intriguing enjoyable and texturally fascinating! \n\nother notable dishes included:\nkobe garlic skirt 7.50 x2\nkurobuta pork cheek 4.25$ x2\n<mark>Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard</mark> 10\nduck in balsamic 4.50$ x2\niberico pork 10 x2\nnigori 40$ well worth it! imo i bought 2 bottles :)\n\nall in all, i had a great dining experience at raku and it's safe to say i'd gladly return to enjoy their enticing small plates again and, of course, to imbibe in their spirits!\n\nhappy eats!", 
            "what brought us in: a multitude of different sounding foie gras dishes.\n\nto start with, the foie gras was a disappointment. out of everything we had here it was my least favorite. we decided to go out on a limb and order the steamed foie gras with <mark>Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard</mark> dish. it came out last, although i believe it was the very first thing we ordered (odd). this foie gras was probably one of the most disappointing pieces of foie gras i have ever had. it tasted much more like a breast of duck grilled. the <mark>Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard</mark> had a smooth texture and was sitting in what tasted to me like miso soup. ($10)\n\nmoving on, we ordered \"off menu\" from their chalkboard specials. so, we went all out, because why not? we ordered the monk fish which came in a bowl swathed in some sort of brown jello. the jello had a taste i just could not come to terms with while the monk fish was much like a fish pate, but my friend said it looked like cat food. ($10)\n\nnext - wagyu beef sashimi - 6 very thinly cut pieces. mouth-watering and delicious. absolutely superb, but i would have liked to have had 6 more. ($20)\n\non to the skewered items we shared. kobe beef with wasabi - also delicious, just like the wagyu, only this time, grilled with a distinct flavor and of course, it was great quality meat. pork cheek - also delicious, i am a fan of fatty items like this. \n\nthat's all she wrote. we skipped dessert because we were afraid it would come out in tiny portions and we were ready to go because we had already spent a buttload of money and we were still hungry.\n\nthe food is superb quality, obviously. presentation is perfect. but i just did not feel as though it was worth the money i spent to still be hungry afterward. i think this was one of those, \"well, we tried it, so that's all.\" types of places for myself and my friend. \n\nthe restaurant itself it small, but decorations and seating and ambiance are pluses in my book for a restaurant of this size. service was also good, our waters were kept filled and everything came out in a timely manner (save for the foie gras).\n\nmake a rez, as we were there on a wednesday night without one, and although they allowed us to have a table we were given a time limit on how long we could be there.\n\nmy overall return factor is low, unless i plan to take a client here to impress them and use my company credit card for the bill.", 
            "try the korubuta pork cheek, sirloin skirt steak with garlic, chicken with skin, soooo yummy; grilled tendon (very tender & melts in your mouth). onaki mushroom wrapped in bacon, best agedashi & raku tofu!  best robata in lv. cures my cravings for the <mark>Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard</mark> - which is my all time favorite :)", 
            "food\nthe omakase: it was ten dishes, very delicious for the most part, except for the fish, because the bone was in it and they were annoying to eat. i did not like the fish also because the face was look straight at me. glad they only gave us one fish to share. stuff i did enjoy \nfoie gras bowl: simple rice bowl with teriyaki and what looked like a full duck liver, which was tender and delicious as solid butter. \nhouse made tofu: interesting experience, it was cold, and had salt and dips that were also interesting. imagine a flavorless ice cream with salty toppings. sounds like a bad experience, but it was good. \nthe sashimi was good, i liked how our waitress told us how to eat the different types of fish, and which sauces and salts the fish were intended to be eaten with. \nthere were other dishes, but each omakase is different based on the chef, but i think these three things were standard\nthe dessert was pretty awesome the cream cheese with strawberry sauce on the side was delicious.\nthe service: very nice waitress,  very helpful with the menu. lots of water refills and lots of checking up on us. i loved how she told us how the chef intended for us to enjoy each dish. added to the experience.\nthe restaurant: the decor was a typical japanese restaurant. nothing special about it. it was standard. the bathroom had a cool looking sink though. the tables had a cool slot for the menu. it was an actual slit made just for the menu, so we could pick it up to look at and it would not be in our way. very innovative i thought. \n\nall in all i want to come back and try other things like <mark>Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard</mark>.", 
            "a very intimate and flavor intense dining experience. it's not a place to go if you' re rushed. they really take their time on bringing out the dishes, it's even borderline too slow. we ordered about over 10 dishes but it would take about 30-40min just for 3 dishes to come out. i really wanted to try more dishes, but obviously 2hours was not enuff time, and since we were running short on time we weren't even halfway to being full. nonetheless, we did enjoy what little bites we did have. \n\nhighlights: fois <mark>Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard</mark>, oyster, hamaci carpaccio,uni w/ <mark>Poached Egg</mark> and iwagaki oysters. \n\nyou really can't go wrong w/ any of their dishes. since it is tapas style you do get to try a lot of unique dishes, but only complaint is that portions are small, so it would take a lot to feel satisfied (especially for big eaters such as myself).",

            "raku is hands down one of the best japanese restaurants i've been to in the us. i've been to raku for about three times now and i make it a point to order different items from the menu each time. for me, their most stellar items on the menu are the <mark>Ken Salad</mark>, the foie gras chawan mushi (<mark>Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard</mark>), and the wagyu sukiyaki (on special menu). their grill items were also consistently very good. my friends and i also loved the buttered saut\\u00e9ed hotate (scallops) and the <mark>Fried Ice Fish</mark>, but those are items you can easily find at other gourmet japanese restaurant so if you have to plan your meal, i would go for the <mark>Ken Salad</mark>, the chawan mushi, 2-3 grilled items (we loved the kurobuta pork cheek), and the sukiyaki ($40-50). be prepared to spend upwards of $50 per person.\n\nthe not so nice thing about raku is their service. they are courteous but not attentive. we had to try and catch the servers' attention several times before being approached. they also didn't run us through their special menu until after i asked if they were still serving their wagyu sukiyaki. getting a reservation at this place is an absolute nightmare. the receptionist is fond of saying sorry no and does not offer any options (ie. no suggestions of other vacant times nor information on tables that are reserved for walk ins). on one occasion, we arrived 5 minutes late and after making us wait almost 10 mins, the receptionist then told us they couldn't sit us because the next table reservation was in 20mins. mind you, that was at 6pm, and 2/3rd of the place was still empty. if you want a table at raku, better call and reserve at least 3-4 days in advance. a vegas trip simply isn't complete without a visit to this appetite fulfilling place !", 
            "i was so thrilled to try this place out, but i didn't leave here super pleased. :(\n\nbefore i start this review, i must say that i am not a fan of seafood aka raw fish aka fish aka most of the things on the menu. i prefer cooked foods, chicken, vegetables and red meat. so dun, dun dun, i tried the hiyashi chawanushi, <mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark>, <mark>Crispy Asparagus Okaki</mark>, <mark>Juicy Deep Fried Chicken</mark>, kobe beef filet, kobe beef skirt, grilled duck, and eggplant. \n\nhiyashi chawanushi: this dish was a daily special. i believe it was an <mark>Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard</mark> with crab and something else on top. like i said above, i'm not a fan of seafood, and this dish had such a fishy taste to it. i gagged a little after trying it, and i couldn't get rid of the fishy taste it left in my mouth. we left 90% of it left, because the dish itself was overwhelming.\n\n<mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark>: i have to agree with all the other yelpers. the best and most fresh tofu. get this!\n\n<mark>Crispy Asparagus Okaki</mark>: this dish comes with pieces of asparagus breaded with rice cracker. very delectable. \n\n<mark>Juicy Deep Fried Chicken</mark>: the best dish. like its name, it was six pieces of extremely mouthwatering chicken on a bed of spinach. the chicken itself was superb. the spinach and the sauce complimented the chicken. i definitely recommend this!\n\nkobe beef filet with wasabi/kobe beef skirt with garlic: very nice cuts of kobe beef. i liked the garlic one more, because all i could taste was wasabi and no meat. \n\ngrilled duck: i can't remember much about the duck except for its tangy aftertaste and chewiness. bleh, i guess i was expecting something different. thank goodness they present each table with tea afterwards, because i could not stand the aftertaste.\n\neggplant. grilled eggplant sprinkled with a ton of dried ginger. the eggplant was soft and appetizing, but the ginger ruined it for me. the ginger itself has a strong flavor, and i thought there was just too much ginger on there. i still ate it, but i took off most of the ginger.  \n\nof the eight dishes, i would only come back for the tofu, asparagus and <mark>Juicy Deep Fried Chicken</mark>. maybe we just ordered the wrong things, but i would not come back here. :c",

            "what can i honestly say about raku that probably hasn't already been said? the food was elegant and well executed, though some of the dishes had less than outstanding flavor overall. the service was pleasant, though the pacing on that night was difficult. we couldn't get a reservation that night, but we showed up at opening and got seated at the bar - really not a bad deal because you do get to watch the chefs in motion.\n\nwhile i sampled many dishes, these were my main hits and misses...\n\nby and far the most unique and pleasant flavor of the evening was the udon noodle with <mark>Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard</mark> soup - extremely rich and flavorful with a unique style to it. thin cold udon noodles weren't exactly my favorite idea - i actually felt like a warm noodle soup would be fine. but still, there was an amazing depth of flavor with this dish, and a unique presentation on top of it.\n\nthe hamachi kama was a huge piece of fish collar with a ton of flavor and was very tender. this was also a great value being priced under 20 dollars for the amount of fish on the actual plate.\n\nthe kobe beef liver sashimi was something i really tried on a whim - really kind of unique in that it has a slimy but incredibly smooth texture, i wasn't sure i loved the flavor but the special salt they had at the table side really helped enhance what was already there. it was unique, but i doubt i'd try it again.\n\nwhile the kobe beef outside skirt with garlic was really good, i didn't really enjoy the fillet with wasabi - it was too lean and the wasabi overwhelmed the flavor. the tsukune-grilled ground chicken was a bit of a disappointment as well - i've had similar at kyara and it was no better nor any different. the duck and lamb were each average to me - the duck had a good texture, but i didn't care for the presentation or the overall flavor. the lamb was marinated which really covers up the flavor of the lamb and because it was an apple marinade, it came out rather sweet.\n\none of the highlights of the evening was the dessert - a fluffy cheese cake which had a texture closer to a cloud rather than the heavy cheese cake that is typical. the sweetness was muted as well, but it was still absolutely delicious.\n\nunfortunately i felt that the service was a little less than stellar because the pacing of the dishes was rather iffy. after the appetizers, we waited about 20 minutes for the hamachi kama, and then suddenly all the grilled items were coming out faster than we could eat.\n\nstill, i had some very memorable bites of food here that i will think back upon for a while. it was pricey, but definitely not astronomical by any means.", 
            "after two more visits to raku since my last review, it deserves another update.  i'm not going to dive too much into this review because you all already know this place is good, especially if you've read my past reviews.  service is still top notch and the food is still impeccable.\n\nbut i will share with you some of the highlights during those two visits.\n\nraku tofu --  http://bit.ly/1zaxexb\nno matter how many times i order this, i'm always blown away by how creamy raku's cold tofu is.\n\n<mark>Juicy Deep Fried Chicken</mark> -- http://bit.ly/1p0x6cd\nthis is not your usual chicken karaage.  it's better!  it's literally very juicy and very flavorful along with the crispy skin.\n\n<mark>Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard</mark> -- http://bit.ly/1zayovv\nalong with the raku tofu, this is still a must order and also my personal favorite.\n\nfoie gras rice bowl --  http://bit.ly/1kev43i\nbig hunk of foie gras over rice.  it's a good thing to order if you don't get the custard.\n\nduck with balsamic soy --  http://bit.ly/1v66omu\ni saw this on their facebook page and it looked and sounded really good.  the duck was cooked nicely.\n\nkobe beef w/ wasabi --  http://bit.ly/1zaxrtc\ntheir kobe beef yakitori are always amazing.  and this one of course has a nice kick with the fresh wasabi.\n\noyako don --  http://bit.ly/1v666fd\nif you've followed my reviews and pics before, you probably know that lately i've been on an oyako don hunt.  raku's is good and filling, but pretty much is the same as the other places i've had it, and that's not a bad thing.\n\nalso on a side note, i don't think i've actually mentioned this before in my past reviews, but their toilet is awesome!  -- http://bit.ly/1v65k8o\nit has a heated seat and cleaning controls are above the handrail.  it's an experience you have to try!  seriously!\n\nas you can see raku still delivers and is still my favorite japanese restaurant of all time.  i was a little worried when anthony bourdain taped his show here thinking that the added exposure would make it harder to land a table here but that hasn't been the case with my last pair of visits.  for that i'm glad because for me, a foodie trip to vegas without raku would be so incomplete.", 
            "i'm from the midwest area, which authentic japanese dining is very limited. everytime i visit vegas ( at least twice per year), i would make a reservation for raku. the restaurant is limited in space and highly rcmd reservation (they usually seat reservation in one of the private booth/room). rcmd checking out the bathroom which has a fish tank and heated toilet.  i've been to raku for few times and these reviews are based on all the items i've tried. sometimes, there may be a language barrier and was difficult to understand the type of fish or entree for the daily special. \n\nskewers: the price on the menu is for one skewer. skewers are cooked over a special type of charcoal from japan, therefore you would really taste a bbq/charcoal flavor in the meat.\n\nkobe tendon - rcmd sharing this skewer with others. the tendon which is good fat, would melt like butter in your mouth. don't consume too much of it because it very heavy in taste. i would just take a bite of it for sampling. \n\nkobe beef filet with wasabi - $12 a skewer for kobe filet which was a thick cut. it was good, but it was okay. maybe it was too well done, i prefer medium rare. personally, i think the kobe skirt which was thinly sliced tasted better.\n\nkobe beef outside skirt $8- one of my favorite skewer, the beef was tender and tad of charcoal taste to it. not too overdone and just right. \n\nbeef tongue - delicious and it's a bit crispy and bouncy to the taste, \n\nkurobuta pork cheek - very tasty. love it.\n\nchicken - i always order the wrong chicken or  different chicken skewer but it's all tender and juicy,\n\nyellowtail $7 - good deal for a tasty filet of yellowtail with glazed sweet sauce over it. it was flaming delicious. \n\neggplant - direct flamed eggplant that was covered with bonito flake. it was not spectacular, but average.\n\nregular food item:\nraku tofu - home made tofu that is nicely presented. i usually sprinkle with the matcha sea salt and bit of the house soy sauce. my usual appetizer that i order every time.\n\nudon with <mark>Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard</mark> soup - the udon is served cold in a basket and i think it's homemade because it's not the typical thick udon. the foie gras is infused in the <mark>Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard</mark>. you dip the cold udon into the warm <mark>Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard</mark> soup. sooo hearty... unfortunately, i flll up on the skewer and never have room for the udon.\n\n<mark>Poached Egg</mark> with sea urchin and salmon roe - pretty much everything mixed together in a small bowl. it's all raw and raw. the taste was okay and fresh, but not amazing. the texture was slimy been there, done that.. ill try something else next time\n\n<mark>Juicy Deep Fried Chicken</mark> - <mark>Juicy Deep Fried Chicken</mark> and the chicken was juicy and tender. \n\ngrilled rice ball -  a ball of rice that is fried on the outside. cool concept, but i'll skip it and save room for the skewers.\n\ndaily chef's special:\nrock fish - the whole fish was served in chunks of sashimi which was sweet and extremely fresh. my friend and i finished the whole fish. soy sauce and wasabi is not needed, just chew it raw!!!  it's very reasonable for $45. later, the bones of the fish was fried and served. this is one of my favorite fish.\n\nwagyu beef sukiyaki - do you know how difficult to find a restaurant that serves sukiyaki the right way? most place would just dump the meat and the vegetable in a bowl and serve it.  raku does it just like how it's done in tokyo! the vegetable are cooking over a pot of charcoal claypot and the raw meat is placed atop and simmers to your liking. the waiter would crack a raw egg in a bowl and it's used for dipping for the meat. love it and i wish there was more meat to it.\n\noverall, one of my favorite robata grill. after the meal, it's pretty heavy and you might to drink some alcohol with your meal. the plaza that this restaurant is located is a foodie paradise. in this plaza, there is sweets raku, monta ramen, kung fu tea, snowflake shavery ice, kabuto, japanese curry, and japanese italian noodle (not sure of the name).", 
            "a definite must-return! \n\nreservations are highly recommended. my friend and i dined in on a weekday and the place was packed. the two of us were overly ecstatic and over-ordered upon being seated: \n\nwe ordered three items off the appetizer section. raku's tofu is homemade as is the soy sauce. it is a delicacy that should not be skipped. the <mark>Poached Egg</mark> with sea urchin and salmon roe were very fresh, but i was not a fan of the slimy texture. \nthe butter sauteed scallop with soy sauce arrived on half of a clam shell. it was perfectly glazed and seared. \n\nas for the robata grill, we ordered various skewers. the chicken thigh was not what i wanted but nonetheless, the meat was tender and succulent. the yellowtail glazed with soy-based sauce was done in medium. for $7, it is well worth it and can be shared among two people. the kurobuta pork intestine was exceptionally soft and without a slight sense of gaminess. the kurobuta pork cheek arrived with a shimmer resembling fatty meat. but the texture was crisp and the flavors were perfect. i would definitely order this one again.\n\nit does not end there. we also ordered the kobe beef outside skirt with garlic and kobe beef tendon. i am not a big fan of garlic, but i made the exception without regret. if you're feeling in need of collagen, get a skewer of tendon all to yourself. if you are not particularly fond of the soft, gelatin, melt-in-your-mouth texture, share it with somebody!\n\nlast but not least, we ended our meal with the udon with foie gras and <mark>Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard</mark> soup. unlike most thick-cut udon noodles, this one resembles angel hair. the udon is served separately in a tiny basket with a generous piece of foie gras floating atop the bowl of warm broth. i was pretty full from the items above but this was not something to turn away from. \n\nthe damage was done at approximately $50 per person.", 
            "a must-eat when i go to las vegas.  i can probably go on about a lot of these items, but my absolute fave go-to's would be: \n1.  <mark>Sashimi Salad</mark> (cannot rave enough about this)\n2.  <mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark> (it's homemade tofu!)\n3.  <mark>Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard</mark> (don't ask. just eat)\n\nthey always have different special items everyday as well that are pretty good too.  i have heard people rave about the omakase but have not yet tried.  maybe next time!",

            "so glad i got to try this place!\n\nwhat i ate:\n- raku's tofu: honestly, this was my favorite dish of the night. it was so simple, but soooo tasty, especially when paired with the various condiments found on the table - the aged soy sauce, the sea salt, etc. the tofu was so fresh. the texture was like a firm custard or a panna cotta. i wanted to order another one just for myself. \n- <mark>Poached Egg</mark> with sea urchin and salmon roe: so, i loved this dish soooo much, but it wasnt perfect for me. i mean, i love everything in this dish. even the mountain yam, with it's ooey gooey texture was nice in this dish. but for me, this would have been perfect over a nice bowl of fresh white rice, with just a drizzle of the aged soy sauce. that would have been my perfect dish. it was still great to eat though. it was ooey from the mountain yam (if you havent had it before it has that slimy texture, similar to okra, but it crunchy like an apple), the bursts of sea salt freshness from the uni, the salty umami pops from the salmon roe, the creaminess from the <mark>Poached Egg</mark>. it was really delicious, but i would love this over a bowl of white rice. \n- <mark>Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard</mark>: this was probably the other contender for my favorite dish of the night. the <mark>Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard</mark> was sooooo ... omg, let me wipe the drool from my face. it was so creamy and silken and salty and full of umami flavor from the foie gras. the little piece of foie on the top was tender. it came in a tiny little bowl, and i wanted more, so much more. \n- (special) grilled langostine: yes. this was tasty. sweet and tender, and a bit smokey from the grill. \n- kobe beef filet w/wasabi: i loved the fresh wasabi. it complimented the tender beef so well\n- kobe beef outside skirt w/garlic: do you love garlic? do you love beef? then you should get this skewer. the fried garlic was a tasty little garlic chip, the beef tender\n- kobe beef liver: i was not a fan, but i'm not a fan of liver in general. i'm not that cultured i suppose. it was just a bit too gritty and irony for me, but my two dining buddies loved it. more for them!\n- butter sauteed sea scallop with soy sauce: this was absolutely decadent! the scallop was perfectly cooked, but it was the soy sauce butter that made this sooo tasty. it was almost too salty, but i didnt care. wanted to eat them all \n- mushroom w/bacon: cooked to perfection\n\npros:\n- food: i really wanted to try everything on this menu! i definitely want to come back and get the omakase tasting menu\n- service was spot on, typical of a japanese restaurant\n- quality of the food was exquisite\n- decor: i really liked how this place was decorated. it was dark and intimate, the tables were of wood. it was nice. \n\ncons:\n- small. tiny. seriously, very small restaurant. two small dining rooms, one counter where you could sit in front of the cooks. this isnt the place to bring your six other friends. best to bring a date or just a few other friends\n- reservations are hard to come by. actually, no it wasnt hard, but when we made reservations a month in advance, the first time that was available was 1030 at night. i found it amusing that a family was there around that same time asking for a table, and being turned away, next the next available seating time was at 130am. so my advice make a rez! \n- pricey. yes. but... not pricey. admittedly this was our second dinner of the night (fatty status oink oink!), but i thought for the quality of the food we got, and the thoughtfulness in which the food was prepared, the price point was just right. though i've never had it, i would think that the omakase tasting menu would be the best bang for your buck!\n\nwould i come again? yes! already planning my next meal here", 
            "favorite dishes of the night were the <mark>Yellowtail Carpaccio</mark>, blue fin tuna sashimi, foi gras skewers and the wagyu with garlic chips. all excellent.\n\n cooked yellowtail, cooked liver, liver sashimi, and duck was pretty good. didn't really enjoy the foi <mark>Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard</mark> surprisingly... considering how many people recommended it. we thought the foi gras skewers were much much better. the pig ear and intestine were too chewy for us but we aren't used to eating those cuts. for any chicken lovers the thigh was very juicy and flavorful. \n\nfor your first time i would recommend ordering one order of multiple items so you can try a lot and decide what you like enough to get more of next time!", 
            "raku is one of those vegas-exclusive dining experiences every local has to have at least once. i lived here nearly a year and a half and finally found an occasion worthy of a family dinner at raku. \n\nappetizers\nraku's tofu: worth at least trying, great silky texture\nkobe beef liver sashimi: there's no getting around the strong liver taste, it's not for everyone. the roasted garlic chips add flavor and texture.\n<mark>Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard</mark>: great dish, minimal foie but still very enjoyable. there was also some roe in this that we hadn't expected.\n<mark>Poached Egg</mark> with sea urchin and salmon roe: this dish wasn't for me at all. i like <mark>Poached Egg</mark>, and urchin, and roe, but this didn't come together and the egg was closer to raw than poached.\n<mark>Juicy Deep Fried Chicken</mark>: an incredible introduction to the wonderful chicken dishes raku's kitchen puts out, even the spinach garnish was delicious\n\nrice & noodle\ngrilled rice ball in broth with salmon: great pick. light broth that tasted more like a tea due to the steeped seaweed in the dish. rice retains the grilled texture despite being soaked in broth. salmon surcharge was $3 but piece of fish was the size of a thumb nail, didn't contribute anything to the flavor.\n\nrobata\nchicken thigh & chicken breast wrapped with chicken skin: the chicken robata dishes were my favorites, with a smoky grilled taste and juicy beyond belief\nkobe beef filet with wasabi: the beef was good, but i'm not a fan of wasabi so that kind of ruined this for me\nkobe beef tendon: nope. not happening. too adventurous for me.\npork ear: tasty with lots of texture. server recommends their spicy table sauce, which was basically a punch of straight-up pepper. i'd recommend it without.\nduck with balsamic soy sauce: ordered two of these knowing i'd love it, and i did. lacked the gamey taste that turns a lot of people off to duck. good choice.\ntomato with bacon & mushroom with bacon: i'm not generally a bacon fan, but adding a veggie into the mix somehow does it for me. \n\ndessert\nfluffy cheesecake: i'm not a dessert fan, and found this a bit too cheesy for me, but when you get to the raspberry filling? oh man, all bets are off. \n\nabove meal was under $200 with a carafe of ashahi ($30) and tip, and enough for three to share happily. service was just okay, polite and professional but detached and didn't make a connection or any recommendations even when we mentioned it was our first visit. make sure to take at least one trip to the bathroom, it's beautiful.\n\nwe made reservations a few days in advance, and staff were awesome about calling us back when they were unable to pick up. reservations secure your table for 15 minutes (show up on time!), and you get the table for 2 hours. toward the end of the night (11pm?) people were able to walk-in for bar seats.", 
            "i went in to our meal with very high hopes. i  normally disappointed when the hype is big. i must say this place is better than i thought it would be. i love that you can order almost like tapas. pick and choose your very own perfect tasting menu. \n\nwe order \nraw:\nsashimi \nuni w/<mark>Poached Egg</mark>\n\ngrill: \npork cheeks \nskirt steak with garlic chips \nfilet with wasabi. the most tender filet i've ever had at a japanese charcoal restaurant. \nduck in soy  i would skip this one. not enough fat rendered. \nchicken breast wrapped in chicken skin. \ngrill seared scallop with soy \n\ntofu/custards: \n<mark>Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard</mark>\ntofu agedashi amazing! \n\nwe left very full and very please. the only mistake was i wish i booked dinner friday and saturday. enjoy", 
            "another visit to raku and had another stellar experience at the kitchen bar.  one thing that i tried to do different this time was to order things i've haven't had before.  even though i've been to raku five times already, there were still plenty more things on and off their menu that i've yet to try.\n\non to the food.  so pretty much everything except for the last two items were all new dishes for me.\n\nmushoom salad complimentary appetizer -- http://bit.ly/1bcj0l6\nthis was their amuse-bouche for the day.  i love mushrooms so this was a very good way to start off my dinner.\n\n<mark>Poached Egg</mark> with sea urchin and salmon roe -- http://bit.ly/1gyp7jq\nnot only was this appetizer photogenic, it was really good!  of course anything with a runny egg is good in my book.  and the uni and roe combo was creamy and surprisingly not too salty.  i'd would definitely order this again!\n\nbraised abalone special with dashi gravy -- http://bit.ly/1ex5nsv\nthis was off of their specials board.  and i'm glad i ordered it.  i have never had abalone before so this was a new experience for me.  the abalone was grilled, sliced up, and smothered with gravy.  i was thinking that it was going to have a very strong fishy taste, but that wasn't the case.  it was almost like eating a lobster or monkfish where it had a chewy texture and it would take a long time to chew out the flavor which had a lot of umami thanks to the dashi gravy.  delicious!\n\ngrilled langoustine -- http://bit.ly/1gxvpda\nas i was eating my appetizer, i was peering over to their seafood table behind the bar and saw these amazing looking langoustines.  i had to have one so immediately ordered it.  it was good!  the langoustine was grilled to perfection where it was easily removable from the shell and the meat was very tender and flavorful.  it was worth the impulsive splurge.\n\nduck with balsamic soy sauce -- http://bit.ly/1i4mpol\ni ordered this last time i here and it was still just as good.  the duck was grilled nicely and had a very rich flavor with the balsamic soy sauce.\n\ngrilled foie gras with black garlic and glazed soy-based sauce -- http://bit.ly/1ncae7d\nwhat better way to finish my meal off than with a stick of their famous grilled foie gras.  it actually has been a while since i last ordered this so i figured it was worth another go around.  they really don't hold back with the portion size as you can see from the pic.  it's a very generous sized piece of foie gras.  and it was so good.  i love how they include a piece of black garlic to give it a more intense flavor.  i'll be alternating between this and their <mark>Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard</mark> from now on.  as much as i'd like to have both as the same time, it'd be better for me to keep them separate since they're equally rich and exquisite.\n\nraku does it again for me with their great service and impressive dishes.  i'm so happy to see that business is still doing well for them.  reservations are still hard to get here as i found that out from another customer that she made her reservation almost a month in advance.  hopefully with their recently announced expansion, it'll be much easier to get a reservation and should provide more tables for walk-ins as well.  there's still plenty more for me to try at raku, so expect another review from me in the near future.", 
            "raku! yes! i will come back to vegas just to eat here. brace yourself, this is gonna be a long one (can't stop gushing).\n\nfor starters, you have to make a reservation, i suggest a few days in advance because it's a small place. their sake list is impressive and they offer quite a selection by the glass. i just asked my server for a recommendation, and he steered me in the right direction.\n\nwe started with a whole order of the raku tofu.... tofu has been ruined for me as i will never look at it again the same way. it was creamy, flavorful and mind-blowing. they serve it with a heap of bonito flakes, chive and ginger. they also offer an array of wonderful condiments. a house blended soy sauce (with plum), a hot pepper infused sake condiment, shichimi (a flavorful spice blend) and green tea salt with seaweed and shiitake powder (quite possibly the best salt ever made). green tea salt + raku tofu = unbelievable!\n\nnext we had some breaded deep fried asparagus. sounds like nothing special, right? oh so wrong. perfectly cooked asparagus breaded with something interesting. (the texture and taste was like those savory glazed asian rice snacks, i'm going to say it was that). perfectly crunchy.. perfectly seasoned.. best aparagus i've ever had hands down. add some green tea salt and you're in heaven.\n\nnext came some bacon wrapped enoki mushrooms. my friend loved them, but they were my least favorite part of the meal. it's a texture thing..\n\nmake sure to check out the specials. if i had not, i wouldn't have experienced one of the best bites in my life. iberico pork roasted on the robata grill... for those unfamiliar, iberico is a spanish pig that roams freely, munching on acorns. extremely expensive, and hard to find where i'm from. $10/skewer says all. i was seriously not expecting to be this blown away. one bite in, i'm sure my face said it all. we probably sounded like fools, pretty much having foodgasms with each bite. 1) the meat was astonishingly perfectly cooked.. med rare, some char but not too much. 2) the flavor. not only was the rich, nuttiness of the meat present, but they had to have brined it or something. it was seasoned throughout.. if they still have this available when you go.... do yourself a favor.\n\nnext we had the pork cheek. absolutely wonderful, wish we would have had it before the iberico.. because nothing could beat that.. so we thought.\n\nnext came our <mark>Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard</mark>. we thought it would simply be that. nope. delicately <mark>Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard</mark>, topped with a thin layer of house made dashi and a very thinly sliced piece of duck breast (that, once again, was a perfect mr, given that it was only 1/4 of an inch thick.. skills). one bite and it brought tears to our eyes it was so good. the umami of that dish was unfathomable. the custard was silky and served at the perfect temperature. the foie was there, but not until the end and it played so well with the other flavors. this was the best part of the meal, hands down.\n\nwhile eating the custard, our duck with balsamic glaze arrived. we tried a piece, wonderful of course, then mixed the duck with the custard. i even drizzled some balsamic glaze in there... and it got even better.\n\nto finish, we had the kobe beef tendon. great flavor, smooth. but once again, the texture got me.\n\nservice was on point. we never waited more than 5 minutes in between courses. and he answered all of our questions. \n\nthis was hands down, one of the best meals i have ever had. oh and guess what? with all that food (with multiples of each) 2 glasses of ($10) sake and a beer it cost us $95 before tip.. save your money, skip robuchon come to raku and enjoy yourself even more!\n\ngreen tea offered at the end of each meal as well.", 
            "finally\n\ni have had raku in my cross hairs for many, many years.  the idea of finding parking in an extremely under sized lot without street parking and waiting outside in the sweltering heat amongst smoking fiends was an absolute deterrent.  but lately my commute schedule forces me to look for restaurants opened pass midnight.  gambled that a midnight attempt during a thursday would be in our favor. good thing i made the call first hand from mccarran and followed up with a reservation.  without having to wait, we were seated promptly in the first dining room that includes the vista of the bar, kitchen service window and everyone entering the restaurant.  the other half or adjacent room has at least one private room and other seating arrangements plus their single unisex restroom.\n\nthe two sided menu is cleverly sandwiched in glass and housed in a slot holster at each table.  majority of the diners are newbies and studiously referencing to their smartphones for eye catching suggestions on yelp.  don't be embarrassed. ... we're doing the same too.  there are just too many tempting menu items. we ordered seven items with the <mark>Juicy Deep Fried Chicken</mark> as a last moment add on and eighth and last item.\n\n\ncold  dishes:\n\nhomemade tofu - raku whole order served with a side of chili garlic sauce and japanese mustard green ... uniquely raku's .... dense, slightly cream like experience\n\nwaygu beef sashimi with special blended soy sauce (not on menu, by request only) ...  beef eater's dream come true\n\n<mark>Yellowtail Carpaccio</mark> served with special , soy sauce blend topped with yuzu and daikon ... every table ordered\n\n<mark>Poached Egg</mark> with sea urchin and salmon roe ...  you will live to be 110 years old ... very popular amongst male diners\n\n\nhot dishes:\n\nkurobuta pork belly with spinach and mustard on top ... must eat together with all ingredients for total satisfaction\n\n<mark>Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard</mark> with grilled duck on top ... is your tongue long enough to touch the bottom of your cup ?\n\n<mark>Juicy Deep Fried Chicken</mark> (not on menu, by request only)  ...  assured  a filling and grand experience\n\nrobata grill butter sauteed scallop ... only dish that failed to stoke my taste buds ... scallop was over cooked and partially chewy and tough.\n\nunfortunately, the very pretty lady reading the chalkboard specials had a very thick japanese accent and we didn't understand most of what she was attempting to promote. the ambiance is simple and strong, while ceiling p<mark>Veggie Pork Intestine In Pot</mark> table lighting greatly assisted in reading the small print on the menu and made food photography a cinch.  all in all it was a very memorable dining experience and essentially fulfillled my expectations of what is deemed refined japanese cuisine.\n\nthis is my review #666.", 
            "this place is amazing! i made a reservation about 3 weeks in advance for my birthday. they called the day of to reconfirm. \nthe pricing for everything is very good and everything tasted delicious! \nwe asked to see the specials of the day but those didn't show prices unless you ask for them. \na lot of the menu had foie in it (yum!!). they also serve one type of dish at a time and wait for you to finish before bringing the next item. we got almost 2-4 of everything and it worked out well. \nmy favorites were the raku tofu, <mark>Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard</mark>, and kobe liver tartare. the flavors on those dishes were wow. the liver was fresh and melt in your mouth and is topped with raw garlic slices. the tofu was very silky and they gave specific instructions on how to eat and what to pair with it. the <mark>Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard</mark> has got to be one of the best of tasted. it has foie on the top and a lot of the flavor mixed in.\nsome of the other dishes we got were okra, eggplant, pork, tendon, scallop, salmon, foie, and foie bowl. everything was seasoned properly maybe except for the eggplant (too much ginger). \ntheir pitchers of beer carry around 6-8 glasses, which is very good for the price. \nthe service was also excellent. our waters were constantly being refilled and plates taken away or replaced. \noverall i had a very good birthday dinner here; we ordered just the right amount of food and everything was delicious. \nalso! check out the bathrooms...there's two of them and they're cleaned and decorated and super cool. \n\np.s. use the matcha salt on everything!!!",

            "4.5 stars\n\nduring my last trip to vegas in january, i wanted to try raku, but i couldn't get a same day reservation. this last trip, i made sure to call ahead and reserve a spot. we had dinner here on thursday, july 9th at 10pm. we were a party of 5 and shared everything.\n\nwe all got hot tea: hoji cha tea ($2.50ea) and a bottle of sake to share: shichihonyari \"seven spears men\", junmai nama genshu, prefecture: shiga ($80 bottle). description of sake from menu: \"this is a very drinkable but complex limited released unpasteurized sake has the prototypical sake brewery aroma that is like a wet collection of steamed rice, green grasses, yeast and green apples. a nama that actually tastes like rice, which is a rarity these days.\" i don't know much about sake, but this was dry enough for me to drink. and i was sold when they said limited release!\n\nspecials:\n*wagyu sashimi ($20)\n*bluefin / negitoro ($31)\n*king crab ($20)\n\ni loved the wagyu and sashimi! these were my favorites out of the specials. the wagyu melted in my mouth and the sashimi was super fresh. i'd skip the king crab next time as it was just a grilled leg. it was good, but nothing special.\n\ncold dish:\n*kobe beef liver sashimi ($9.50)\n*<mark>Yellowtail Carpaccio</mark> ($12)\n*<mark>Poached Egg</mark> with sea urchin and salmon roe ($9) x2\n\n<mark>Yellowtail Carpaccio</mark> is a must! so tender. the uni dish is super rich. i enjoyed the first bite, but it needed something to cut through the richness as i continued eating it. i wasn't a fan of the liver sashimi as raw liver isn't really appealing to me.\n\nhot dish:\n*<mark>Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard</mark> ($10) x2\n*agedashi fish belly: hamachi belly ($18), agadashi belly (+$5)\n\ni was in heaven with the steam <mark>Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard</mark>. omg! the silky custard with the delicately seared foie?! sooo good! all flavors i adore. the agedashi fish belly was okay. i thought it wasn't crispy enough and a little mushy. though i'm not sure if we waited too long to eat it. sake will do that to you!\n\nrobata grill:\n*kobe beef outside skirt with garlic ($7.50) x3\n*kurobuta pork cheek ($4.25) x3\n*duck with balsamic soy sauce ($4.50) x3\n*foie gras with glazed soy-based sauce ($17.50) x3\n\nfor 5 people, 3 skewers per order were perfect. we were here to try a bunch of dishes, so half a skewer allowed for a bite or two of each item. i'm a foie addict, so of course i loved the foie! seared to perfection. i also loved the pork cheek. super tender. i also enjoyed the beef and duck. i honestly don't think you can go wrong with any of the skewers they offered. all had a nice smoky flavor and were delicious!\n\nrice/noodle/soup:\n*cold green tea soba with <mark>Poached Egg</mark> ($8.50)\n\nthis was my least favorite dish. i don't really enjoy cold noodles, so i didn't find this appetizing at all. i think cold noodles are supposed to be refreshing, but i just don't get it. i've enjoyed korean cold noodles from time to time, but they have a nice vinegar and spicy flavor. this didn't have that.\n\nyay, i finally tried raku! did it live up to the hype?! definitely with certain dishes! i adored all the foie, carpaccio, sashimi and skewers. some missed the mark for me, but i think it was more about taste preference than anything else. i'm a little sad we didn't try any of their tofu as i believe that is one of their specialties. next time raku, next time!", 
            "rsvpd a few days in advance for dinner at 6:30 on a thursday. we didn't need to wait once we arrived, and luckily got seated towards the quieter back. \n\nwhat we got:\n\n<mark>Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard</mark>- love steamed scrambled egg, chinese people eat it with cooking wine, but their foie gras infusion was killer. great texture too. the only thing i don't like about foie gras, well one of the things, is the livery aftertaste. the custard still had that aftertaste. \n\nfoie gras skewer- for $17 it didn't disappoint. literally melt in your mouth! could've been enough for four i think, but our foie gras aficionado finished it off for us. \n\ngreen tea cold noodle - nice, simple dish that contrasted with the rich, flavorful dishes we ordered afterward. i don't know what the process is for serving cold dishes first, but i would've appreciated this cold noodle more after eating the foie gras. light dish in contrast to the heavy richness of the foie gras. \n\nscallop - served in a hot shell. i didn't think it was amazing. \n\nsea urchin with salmon roe- i'm not a uni fan, but this combo with the <mark>Poached Egg</mark> was awesome. sweet, light, gooey, & interesting textures (bubble like roe & mushrooms held together by the gooey egg yolk). like how the yolk balanced out the uni. \n\n<mark>Sashimi Salad</mark> - that was delicious. i loved the sashimi with the miso dressing. refreshing way to whet our appetites. \n\nraku tofu- you can dress it two ways, and i preferred the chives + soy sauce way. the more i ate it the hungrier i got - so as an appetizer it did its job (making us hungrier and ready for the heartier meat dishes). \n\niberian pork skewers - a special at $10/skewer. i thought it was a tad undercooked, but the meat was definitely tender and fatty. not a huge fan though and prob won't order it again. \n\nwaygu beef sashimi - aka raw beef. after eating this i realized i like my beef cooked medium rare. the beef was tender, but really chewy due to the fat on it. like people in my party were having trouble eating it it was so chewy. at $20 a plate, i'd skip this at the next go round. \n\n<mark>Juicy Deep Fried Chicken</mark>: dark chicken meat cooked like a pot roast, but with a thin crispy skin (like roast duck skin except with chicken). chicken was underdone. truth be told, we only ordered it bc the table next to us ordered it and i'm a fattie that loves me some <mark>Juicy Deep Fried Chicken</mark>. \n\noverall: i generally thought everything needed some salt (not the green tea salt on the table), and most of the red meats and \"other white meats\" could've been cooked slightly more. \n\nservice was very polite, though slightly over attentive. i'm not used to someone constantly coming by your table, switching out your plates after every two dishes, etc. \n\nand it's a very clean restaurant! i read in a cooking book (kitchen confidential) that you can tell how clean a kitchen is by how clean the bathrooms are. the bathroom here was very clean, very japanese (ie super high tech toilets that required actual reading to operate) with an aquarium! i guess they were trying to make us feel like we were in an aquarium too with the blue walls & tile (i'm analyzing this bathroom waaaay too much...).", 
            "a tapas place for us big kids. an extensive menu is offered as well as a daily specials board. the service is a bit slow but the informative and attentive staff makes up for it.\n\nthe restaurant itself is low lit in the second room. if you want it to be a silver bit more bright, request the bar or table seating in the front. \n\neach table comes with information cards explaining the homemade soy sauce and salts.  i was a bit bummed that the one on my table was missing that evening but that's forgivable since i was easily able to grab the empty table's set to read. \n\ni really appreciate the bowls/ plates/spoons change with each dish that comes out. you can tell they take great pleasure in the details of the craftsmanship and  process of each dish.  \n\nwhat was ordered:\n\n<mark>Poached Egg</mark> with sea urchin and salmon roe - i need two orders of this. one egg is not meant for sharing! yum yum!\nchicken breast wrapped with chicken skin - not bad, the chicken meat was a bit dry. i would probably leave room for other items to try on my next visit\nkobe beef outside skirt with garlic - can't go wrong with tender beef and garlic\nkurobuta pork cheek - tasty. it has a nice texture to the bite\n<mark>Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard</mark> - order it! make sure one per person if you are a foie fan. the custard is silky and the foie is melted into the broth \nkobe beef silver skin - not too memorable - i would skip \nfoie gras don- unlike the custard version, this one is a whole slice of the lobe and it's perfect to savor \ngrilled rice ball in broth(add toppings: salmon for the broth) - the layer of rice, ikura and fish is to my liking and they make just right. note- might be considered bland to some\nraku's tofu - offered in two sizes and freshly prepared. they are known for the silky freshness of the tofu and the seasoned condiments that you sprinkle on each bite.  my dining parter did not appreciate it as much as i did. i think if you love tofu, it's worth a try. and yes, truly an experience.\n\nall i know now is that i must hurry on back!\n\n\nwhat you need to know: \n\n-- rsvp is recommended.  in fact, i insist that you do make one as people start queuing up 30 minutes before the restaurant even opens\n-- bar seating is the only area not reserved. first come first serve for bar seating. if you arrive at opening with reservations, you'll have a good chance scoring a seat \n-- they are open until 3am\n-- restaurant has two sections and one bar area \n-- definitely consider the daily specials board\n-- just steps over from sweets raku. (so leave room if you are a dessert lover like myself)\n-- parking is ample in a plaza", 
            "unexpectedly impressed!  will come back tomorrow in a heartbeat! service and food were outstanding, and the price, unbelievable!\n\nstarted with raku tofu, housemade and as silken as they can come, with bonito flakes, scallions and garlic on the side (a must)! we also had wagyu beef sashimi (loved it), kobe beef liver sashimi (hub's favorite), <mark>Poached Egg</mark>, uni and salmon roe (omg!), <mark>Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard</mark> (foie gras in every bite), ikura don (went well with everything), <mark>Juicy Deep Fried Chicken</mark> (oh so tender, juicy and tasty), pork cheeks (flavorful), pig ears (crunchy) and kobe beef tendons (my dessert!). where can you find all these delectable dishes??? not in sf!!  \n\ni like how the waitress let us know in what order the food should be eaten (cuz we kept asking for the ikura bowl and the <mark>Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard</mark> that they held back), from tofu, salad, cold dishes, grilled items to rice bowls.   and which of the special sauce and seasonings to use that is available on each table.\n\nordered a bottle of domaine du chalet pouilly fuisse to wash all that yumminess down!  our first meal of a 7-day stay....boy, it's gonna be hard to beat!", 
            "if you come without ordering a <mark>Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard</mark> all for yourself you are crazy. it might be the most delicious thing i've ever eaten. the kobe beef with garlic skewer was extremely tender and also amazing. the enoki mushroom wrapped in bacon is not to be missed. those mushrooms are the best. the homemade tofu has great texture but no flavor. get an order if you really like tofu and load on those seasonings/toppings. this spot is an absolute gem.", 
            "very busy.  we came in at 1pm and found some 3 seats at the bar table and it was snatched up in 15 mins.  the place is not big, so better make reservations.  they open till 3am, with 2am for last order.  \n\nlove the sashimi or the fresh seafood.  we had the live tenaga ebi and kanpachi, so fresh and full of flavor.  their house made green tea salt and soy sauce are also delish!  super good to go with their house made tofu.  the beef dishes are also tasty, we tried the raw beef liver and the wagyu sashimi, both have so much flavor and texture.  \n\nthe disappointing dishes are tenaga ebi miso soup; too spicy and the claws are hard to spoon out the meat and <mark>Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard</mark> as the foie gras tasted like cooked liver, too over cooked and not fatty at all.  \n\nwe observed our neighbor eating an omakase meal, i have to say our individual orders are better than the omakase.", 
            "my favorite japanese restaurant!!!!! i can't believe i haven't written a review here. my husband and i never fail to visit raku whenever we are in vegas. we plan trips to vegas because we get raku cravings. we were introduced to raku through a highly regarded japanese chef and now this has become a restaurant we recommend to all our friends who visit vegas. it has seemingly become busier/more popular in the past several years (they opened a dessert restaurant in the same plaza about 2 years ago)--good for them!!!  we usually visit late at night--after midnight--to avoid making a reservation. they used to close at 3am but i believe they close earlier now, at 2am. \n\nsome of my absolute favorite dishes include the agedashi (homemade) tofu, <mark>Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard</mark> foie gras udon, their wagyu (a5!) sukiyaki, garlic kobe beef, oyster +caviar, bluefin tuna and another off-the-menu dish. the quality of their food is amazing, they always have imported specials so each time you come there is something unique. they have an phenomenal omakase with no set menu, which is the only thing we get when we visit. love, love, love raku!", 
            "i love this place. \n\nit's so good. we came by right when they opened for dinner, since we didn't have reservations and they were accommodating (or we totally lucked out). the place is really small, so reservations are recommended. \n\nthey have three rotating board specials so you might see different specials being presented to different tables. if you ask, they will bring the other ones around to show you. \n\nwe went a little nuts with our ordering, but mostly everything was amazing. \n\nraku's tofu: \n- wasn't expecting to fall in love with this, i mean it's just tofu right? wrong. it was really good with the different seasoning options. it's tofu, but it's different. worth trying out if you come here since it's made in house. \n\n<mark>Yellowtail Carpaccio</mark>: \nmust get. it was just fresh and simple and delicious. \n\nbuttered scallop: \nthis was so good. the flavors were amazing and complemented the scallop. that butter sauce was so good, i wish i had something to sop it up. actually, my friend loved it so much she picked up the shell to drink the sauce. \n\n<mark>Poached Egg</mark> with sea urchin and salmon roe: \nit's a really rice dish, but it's amazing. we shared this, but i could have easily eaten this on my own. i thought it was going to be a little too fishy but everything was fresh and the flavors melded well together. \n\n<mark>Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard</mark>: \nso good. rich, but so good. we shared this as well, but easily could have eaten our own. the flavors of the fois gras came through but wasn't too heavy, probably balanced by the egg. \n\nagedashi kama: \namazing. the fish was piping hot and moist. i thought i had tried a really good hamachi kama at another restaurant in sf, but this one tops it for sure. it was just really flavorful and delicious. \n\nkobe beef outside skirt with garlic:\namazing. the beef was tender and perfectly cooked. the flavors were on point. \n\nkobe beef tendon: \nthis was a little different from what i expected. i'm used to tendon in soups, so i don't eat dry tendon often, but it was delicious nonetheless. \n\nkurobuta pork cheek: \ndelicious. the flavor was slight and smoky. some places overcook it and make it chewy but this was perfect. \n\nbluefin sashimi:\nprepared three different ways, fresh, grilled, wrapped in sushi. all three ways were delicious, mainly because the fish was so fresh. you can really taste the freshness. \n\nbeef waygu sashimi: \nsounded amazing, but it was a disappointment. the meat was really chewy and it wasn't as good as the kobe outside skirt with garlic we ordered. \n\nfluffy cheesecake: \nwe were intrigued by the description. we even poked at it when it came to the table, but the description of a \"mousse cheesecake\" is fitting. it's just really good. i'd order this again. it didn't feel heavy at all. \n\nwe also ordered a different sashimi option but it wasn't nearly as good as the bluefin. i think our two disappointing items were the beef waygu sashimi and the other fish sashimi option. \n\ni'll definitely come back here. it was a pricey but delicious dinner. worth every penny."

            "the chefs of today may well be the van goghs of our time. the care and precision of modern food presentation has made some of the creations on our plates incredible edible works of art.\n\nthe japanese have the art of food presentation imbued in their food culture and they really put their heart and soul into making their food a feast for the eyes as well as the stomach.\n\non my visit to las vegas last september, i was starting to feel a bit jaded about eating at the big corporate named restaurants on the strip and sought out a dinner spot more in keeping with being a locals' favourite. a yelp search threw up raku and a quick check with local yelp friend emily r confirmed that it was one of her favourite spots in town.\n\ni was especially drawn to their kaiseki menu, where they create a unique menu based on the best ingredients available that day. a quick phone call secured  my dinner reservation and as requested on their website, i pre-ordered the kaiseki menu.\n\nmy taxi dropped outside raku, which is located in a non-descipt small off-strip mall. any initial fears about the unprepossessing surroundings were soon dispelled by the warm welcome i received on entering the restaurant. there was a general hubbub of conviviality in the restaurant all evening with many customers obviously being happy regulars.\n\ni bagged a seat at my favourite place to sit in a restaurant - at the counter watching the chefs at work. i was able to chat to the main chef all evening, who was very happy to engage and explain things to me about my unfolding gastronomic adventure.\n\nevery dish was a work of art and there were quite a few new flavours for my palate to savour.\n\n1. mounta<mark>Veggie Pork Intestine In Pot</mark> croquettes in dashi broth\n\n2. eight mini treasures, including creations such as tofu skin with wasabi and egg with sashimi\n\n3. the house signature homemade silken tofu with salmon roe and homemade green tea salt and soya sauce\n\n4. fluke sashimi and liver with spring radish and grated onion dipped <mark>Veggie Pork Intestine In Pot</mark> sauce\n\n5. japanese/spanish mackarel marinated in yuzu\n\n6. foie gras/<mark>Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard</mark>/summer truffle served in an egg shell\n\n7. eel with shisho pepper\n\n8. uni with egg\n\n9. kobe beef on hot rock flamed with hennessy xo sauce\n\n10. mixed tuna over rice\n\n11. panna cota\n\nas you can see, the list of ingredients is like a who's who of the best ingredients to pass one's lips. everything was a delight to eat.\n\n i love the way that japanese cookery has given exquisite food presentation to the west but in return, the has given them ingredients like foie gras to cook with.\n\nservice was always with a smile all evening.\n\nthe final touch of class came at the end of my meal when the chef confessed that normally, they don't do the kaiseki menu for only one person due to the large amount of prep time involved but as i was visiting from london, they made an exception.\n\narigato, aburiya raku!", 
            "japanese in  las vegas?  okay, let's give it a try-i thought.  so i went.  \n\nvery good izakaya.  the chefs are trained by the head chef who has major skilss from japan and from being a chef at megu.  megu to me is a bit more flash than elegance, but here i go.  many things were very good, with a few minor disapointments. the head chef was trained in kaiseki which is amongst the highest forms of japanese cuisine.  \n\nrobata:  \nkurubuta pork cheak-this was great, with a real charcoal flavor from what i suspect is authentic japanese charcoal.  this pork cheak was more tough than some, but was a wonderful texture and flavor. \n\nkobe beef liver;  i am not a big liver fan, but this was great.  usually well done cooking destroys kobe beef, but not here.  \n\nkobe tendon-this was the best tendon i have ever had.  i think it was braised first or something to soften the toughness.  it was rich and buttery with delicious flavor of soyu and mirin. \n\nchicken skin and breast meet-this was so-so-breast meet tends to be a bit dry and so it was here.  i would have preferred a greater array of chicken choices than this-perhaps chicken skin alone, or wish bone, or something much more exotic. \n\noden: \npork intestine:  great flavors.  very earthy and comfoting. i think the soup needed a bit more mustard for my taste, but i could easily have asked. \n\ndaikon:  what's to say here.\n\nsashimi:  \njapanese sea bass;  okay, but not out of this world.  fish wasn't as flavorful or well textured as i would have liked.\n\ngreen tea soba: \nthis soba came pre-dressed, so there wasn't a dipping sauce.  the texture was perfect-cold and firm. i had to ask for some wasabe for what seemed to me to be some needed balance, but perhaps i don't properly understand this dish.\n\nvegetables <mark>Veggie Pork Intestine In Pot</mark>: \nvery nice, the ponzu seemed to use real yuzu, instead of lemon.  there was a bit too much of the dried bonito on top.  it sounds like they get very very good bonito from japan.  would have loved to try the miso soup to see. \n\nsoyu:  \ntheir recipe for soyu had a bit too much mirin or sugar for my taste.  reminded me of megu, and i have always sort of wondered if megu isn't a bit americanized. \n\nwasabe:  \nwasn't the usual fake stuff of sushi houses; it was the frozen stuff from the pacific northwest which is quite good. \n\nthere was probably more.  the assistant chef-who works in the front of the bar- was quite well trained in the u.s., though he was japanese.  the chef owner was in the back cooking, while this chef was at the bar preparing food.  didn't have the deep food knowlege of a major chef, but was quite good nonetheless.  the sake was very decent and reasonably priced.   there were supporting chefs who were latin american or mexican.  \n\nthis place is really worthwhile, and it can be very hard to get into. the chef has some serious skills and trains his people quite well.  consider a \"kaiseki\" meal here if you go.  probably nice to see what the chef can do with that.", 
            "we did the 15 course kaiseki with premium sake and water pairings.\nmind-blowing doesn't even encompass the greatness of this meal. i'd put this in the top 5 meals of my life. the kaiseki is seasonal and changes, so i won't bother going into all the details... and my pictures were dim and blurry due to lighting, so i'm a bit embarrassed. the service was wonderful. we were seated in a small private room with a paper screen door. two servers served us and seemed available at a moments notice any time. the pairings were phenomenal, but i will say opting for as much sake as we did was probably a bit excessive. another note: unless you really are capable of doing the 15 courses you need to be prepared to either not eat all of some of the latter courses, or have an immense appetite. i consider myself someone who has a pretty big appetite (i've been known to do multiple tasting dinners in one night and then go for late night snacks afterwords), but this was just... too much. when i go back i'll probably either opt for the 10 course, or pace myself and remember i can't possibly finish everything. the last several meat courses were basically about 1/2 the size of full sized entrees. i would also ask to skip the hot sake pairing as that i simply do not enjoy hot sake, period. the owner came and met us and talked for a while, out server translated, and he was so happy and friendly he walked us to the cab and bowed to us as we drove away. fantastic experience. i believe pairings were equal to the cost of the meal per person, so it ended up around $300/pp ++. well worth it.\n\nhighlights: \"kobe\" beef cooked on a stone and flamb\\u00e9ed with cognac, <mark>Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard</mark>, beef tendon, agadashi tofu (perhaps the 2nd best dish), yuba (tofu skin) with uni <mark>Veggie Pork Intestine In Pot</mark> (imo the best dish of the night), cold house tofu.\n\nyou could also go and just do ala carte izakaya style grilled meats and be sublimely happy. the binchotan charcoal and charred meats on skewers is also a wonderful experience. raku is an amazing place. you can spend a lot, or a little and its all just what you want out of it, but be sure it will not disappoint. \n\nvery highly recommended.", 
            "raku is my absolute favorite izakaya. i have been coming here for few years. it's time to write a review. \n\nservice: depending upon the server, some servers are bit snobby which i did not care for at all. sometimes i get lucky and get the better service. also, i don't like the fact that they give you time limit. this is not ayce!!!i understand they are very busy and need their tables  turnover but i just not a fan. i went few days ago, i think the server told us it's time for our last call after 1.5 hours or earlier. those are the reasons i didn't give 5 stars. \n\nfood: i love their food. five star on their food. here are some of my favorite:\n\n1. uni with mounta<mark>Veggie Pork Intestine In Pot</mark>, <mark>Poached Egg</mark> and salmon roe. i love love love this dish. for some reason, the combination of those items together along with the sauce in there makes this dish so heavenly. \n\n2. raku homemade tofu: if you like tofu, then you would love their homemade tofu. i like to eat it with their green tea sea salt along with all the condiments that comes with it. \n\n3. hamachi kama: they have the best hamachi kama in town. they are like 3 times bigger than the regular hamachi kama you order in other places but also 3 times the price. it's around 45 dollars. i think it's worth it, if you have party of three at least. otherwise it might be too big for two people. \n\n4. pork cheek yakitori: i normally don't like pork but their pork cheeks are so juicy and yummy! \n\n5, <mark>Juicy Deep Fried Chicken</mark>: one of my favorite <mark>Juicy Deep Fried Chicken</mark>. they rolled up the chicken thigh and fried it. yum yum yum! \n\n6. kobe beef outside skirt with garlic/ kobe beef fillet fresh wasabi: i like both of these. they are both very tender and juicy. \n\nthese are my must ordered items every time. as far as for their sashimi, i think they are pretty good for the most part. i had the not so fresh sashimi before though. \n\neven though it's hard to get reservation and with the snobby service, i will continue to come and try other items because i love their food so much", 
            "finally\n\ni have had raku in my cross hairs for many, many years.  the idea of finding parking in an extremely under sized lot without street parking and waiting outside in the sweltering heat amongst smoking fiends was an absolute deterrent.  but lately my commute schedule forces me to look for restaurants opened pass midnight.  gambled that a midnight attempt during a thursday would be in our favor. good thing i made the call first hand from mccarran and followed up with a reservation.  without having to wait, we were seated promptly in the first dining room that includes the vista of the bar, kitchen service window and everyone entering the restaurant.  the other half or adjacent room has at least one private room and other seating arrangements plus their single unisex restroom.\n\nthe two sided menu is cleverly sandwiched in glass and housed in a slot holster at each table.  majority of the diners are newbies and studiously referencing to their smartphones for eye catching suggestions on yelp.  don't be embarrassed. ... we're doing the same too.  there are just too many tempting menu items. we ordered seven items with the <mark>Juicy Deep Fried Chicken</mark> as a last moment add on and eighth and last item.\n\n\ncold  dishes:\n\nhomemade tofu - raku whole order served with a side of chili garlic sauce and japanese mustard green ... uniquely raku's .... dense, slightly cream like experience\n\nwaygu beef sashimi with special blended soy sauce (not on menu, by request only) ...  beef eater's dream come true\n\n<mark>Yellowtail Carpaccio</mark> served with special , soy sauce blend topped with yuzu and daikon ... every table ordered\n\n<mark>Poached Egg</mark> with sea urchin and salmon roe ...  you will live to be 110 years old ... very popular amongst male diners\n\n\nhot dishes:\n\nkurobuta pork belly with spinach and mustard on top ... must eat together with all ingredients for total satisfaction\n\n<mark>Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard</mark> with grilled duck on top ... is your tongue long enough to touch the bottom of your cup ?\n\n<mark>Juicy Deep Fried Chicken</mark> (not on menu, by request only)  ...  assured  a filling and grand experience\n\nrobata grill butter sauteed scallop ... only dish that failed to stoke my taste buds ... scallop was over cooked and partially chewy and tough.\n\nunfortunately, the very pretty lady reading the chalkboard specials had a very thick japanese accent and we didn't understand most of what she was attempting to promote. the ambiance is simple and strong, while ceiling p<mark>Veggie Pork Intestine In Pot</mark> table lighting greatly assisted in reading the small print on the menu and made food photography a cinch.  all in all it was a very memorable dining experience and essentially fulfillled my expectations of what is deemed refined japanese cuisine.\n\nthis is my review #666."

            "* last meal worthy *\n\nwhen it comes to fine dining, i typically will only visit a place once in vegas since with all the high-end restaurants on the strip and local spots, there's plenty to go around but i have dined at raku on several occasions and will continue to go back.\n\ni enjoy the atmosphere, rockstar bathrooms, and the overall simplicity to feature its food.\n\nthere are plenty reviews describing the menu so i will just list what i believe are the must have's:\n\n<mark>Sashimi Salad</mark>\nfresh tofu served cold and agadashi\nkobe beef outside skirt with garlic\nkurobuta pork cheek\napple marinated lamb chop\nbutter sauteed scallop with soy sauce\n<mark>Crispy Asparagus Okaki</mark>\ngrilled rice ball\nand lots of beer to wash it down.\n\nthis place is the sh1t - i always over order because i want to eat everything.\n\nmy advice is to select a few of the must have's so each person gets an individual item and then for others you want to try, just share so you can try more variety.\n\ni can't find a fault with this place....definitely one of vegas's best!", 
            "4.5 stars\n\nraku is one of the off-strip las vegas restaurants i hear most about. raku's charcoal-grilled robata is one of the restaurant's specialties, but they also offer a variety of fresh fish and an assortment of cold and hot plates. before going in, i asked around for recommendations and the answers i got spanned the whole menu. clearly, the restaurant does a lot of things well.\n\nwe ordered a bunch of things in no particular order, but started with an amuse from the kitchen.\n\ntaiwanese spinach, enoki mushrooms, shitake mushrooms, bonito flakes - light and refreshing, this was a nice start to the meal.\n\nbluefin tuna sashimi - the restaurant has a chalkboard of daily specials, and this was one of them. oh my goodness...this was fantastic. exceptionally flavored and really tender, this was so good. easily better than much of the toro (and this wasn't toro) i've had in other restaurants; it briefly reminded me of urasawa.\n\n<mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark> - this homemade tofu was very good - soft and delicate with a subtle but present soy flavor. prepared agedashi style, the umami-rich broth was also very good.\n\n<mark>Crispy Fried Shrimp</mark> - the shrimp here were crispy as advertised and moist on the inside. nothing special really, but good. i'm never really sure if i'm supposed to eat these sort of things in its entirety, shell-on; but we did in this case.\n\n<mark>Crispy Asparagus Okaki</mark> - another crispy dish, i enjoyed the contrasting tenderness of the asparagus with the crispy rice cracker breading. there was a nuttiness to the breading, which i thought also went well with the vegetable.\n\n<mark>Juicy Deep Fried Chicken</mark> - this was a little bit unique as it seemed to be chicken that was rolled up, then fried and cut. juicy on the inside and crispy on the outside - no complaints here.\n\n<mark>Yellowtail Carpaccio</mark> - the fish was good here, but the bluefin spoiled me a bit as it didn't seem as special. still, the wasabi and yuzukosho did a nice job of brightening up the yellowtail in this dish.\n\nfish of the day - yellowback seabream - this was one of the fish of the day, served whole. it was a pretty small dish with only about 8 chunks of white flesh. it was very good though, with a crispy exterior from the deep frying.\n\n<mark>Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard</mark> - the custard was silky smooth with a fairly subtle foie gras flavor. very comforting. the piece of duck breast on top was pretty good too.\n\nwe proceeded with a number of robata-grilled dishes.\n\nbutter saut\\u00e9ed scallop with soy sauce - the scallop (served in its shell) was cooked well, but i thought the butter was a little overpowering here.\n\nchicken thigh - this was the first piece where i could really get a sense of the charcoal grill flavor. there was a smoky char on the chicken, and it was moist and flavorful. really simple and really good.\n\nkobe beef filet with wasabi - again, a good smoky flavor from the grill paired with some really flavorful tenderloin. surprisingly juicy and flavorful. i liked the fresh wasabi as well, countering the rich meat. delicious!\n\nkurobuta pork cheek - i was surprised to find this rather chewy, kind of like a chicken gizzard. maybe i just haven't really had cheek in this type of preparation. it was well-marbled, and the porky flavor was present.\n\nkobe beef tendon - not my favorite. i never really like the tendon though, and this was like a big blob of gooey tendon. so meltingly tender, i wasn't sure if i was biting into fat or tendon. i think this was probably a very good preparation, but it's not my thing.\n\nduck with balsamic soy sauce - an interesting dish here - the duck was prepared well, and the balsamic soy and fresh onions did a good job of cutting through some of the richness.\n\napple marinated lamb chop - tender and juicy, this was a damn good lamb chop. i'm not sure if i got any apple flavor though, but i didn't mind.\n\nkobe beef outside skirt with garlic - really good. exceedingly tender and flavorful, with a nice garlic touch.\n\ni had high expectations for raku and i wasn't disappointed. in fact, it exceeded them. after dining at places from joel robuchon and jose andres, it was nice to get something rather simple with clean, familiar flavors. almost like a detox, if you will. the raw fish preparations (ooh the bluefin!) and the robata-grilled items stood out most to me, but it was a well-rounded meal.", 
            "my wife's friend raved about this place, so i had to check it out during my most recent business trip to vegas. having lived in japan, i set the bar for japanese cuisine pretty high. raku met and surpassed all of my expectations.\n\nthe restaurant is extremely small - book reservations well in advance or you have no shot getting in as a walk-in. the japanese staff was very courteous and seated me at the sushi bar. the clientele was colorful to say the least - i was sandwiched between a raku fanatic from the east coast and an asian girl in a formal white dress who was simply off the hook.\n\nafter you're seated, the waitress will bring over a chalkboard with the specials of the day. they're all fresh and worth the money. fresh fish and meat dishes for the most part.\n\ntofu is the specialty of the house, and raku's adedashi tofu is without equal. it comes in a spicy broth with fresh mushrooms, seaweed and salmon eggs on top.\n\nas side dishes i had the <mark>Crispy Asparagus Okaki</mark>, kurobuta pork cheek, sauteed butter scallop and the kobe beef skirt steak with crispy garlic. they were all fantastic, and i wrapped up the meal with the green tea creme brulee, which was to die for.\n\nwatching the chefs work is one of the charms of raku. right before your eyes, they do everything from slicing fresh sashimi to ladeling out bowls of piping hot oden. what's more you can tell they're totally passionate about the cuisine.\n\nraku is a real vegas gem, and it's a good cab ride away from the strip. it's worth it.", 
            "when you start off knowing that all the major players eat here, you know you're in for a meal of a lifetime. not only does raku serve beautifully executed food, it's a bargain at 10+ courses for only $50pp. the icing on the cake is knowing that you may run into joel robuchon, guy savoy, or even mario batali in his orange crocs. raku is the only place that has managed to \"wow\" me even more on the second visit as compared to the first. and that's not discounting the first meal because that was exquisite in and of itself. however on the second visit, raku was able to re-invent itself and offer even more delectables and a considerably different tasting menu that wowed my palate even more.\n\nthe restaurant is unassuming, located in a strip mall in chinatown. the decor is minimal with two bathrooms with serious personality. the service is unfussy but genuine and you can tell that they take great care in plating and execution without taking it too seriously. the flavors are clean and emphasis is on using only the best ingredients. all of the components of each dish are well thought out and serve a purpose. the results are nothing short of amazing.\n\nmy favorites are as follows:\n*<mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark> - homemade tofu melts in your mouth and the broth is heavenly, literally out of this world!\n*<mark>Juicy Deep Fried Chicken</mark> - amazingly <mark>Juicy Deep Fried Chicken</mark> wrapped in <mark>Juicy Deep Fried Chicken</mark> skin...need i say more...\n*<mark>Crispy Asparagus Okaki</mark> - the crispy fry on the outside of the asparagus adds the perfect crunch and toasted rice flavor to add incredible depth. add some green tea salt to bring out the flavors even more\n*dried tatmi <mark>Dried Tatami Sardine Salad</mark> - ceasar salad kicked up a notch, great briny and cheesy flavor\n*kurobuta pork cheek robata - juicy and great grill flavor from the robata\n*<mark>Fried Ice Fish</mark> - beautifully <mark>Fried Ice Fish</mark> served whole with fish nuggets in again, heavenly broth\n*enoki mushroom wrapped in bacon robata - it's wrapped with bacon...need i say more\n*<mark>Yellowtail Carpaccio</mark> - sashimi was incredibly fresh\n*grape tomatoes robata - so simple but simply delicious...add the green tea salt and you're going to be impressed and want to try to make it at home\n*salmon ikura don - beautifully presented and then served into individual portions. the ikura pops in your mouth to bring the taste of the ocean to the salmon rice.\n*udon noodle with <mark>Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard</mark> soup - the broth as well as the noodles were amazing\n*eel don with gobo - again, served with heavenly broth. the gobo added great depth by bringing a bit of earthy bitterness to balance the salty and sweet.\n*<mark>Crispy Fried Shrimp</mark> - fried little shrimpies, delicious.. \n*sorbet of the season - so simple, a strawberry sorbet with condensed milk. the combination makes the sorbet take on a creamy texture and the fruit flavor packs a good punch to end the meal. the kiwi one was delicious as well \n\n\nthe things i would forgo to save room for the things above:\nchicken thigh robata\nchicken breast wrapped with chicken skin robata\nkobe beef outside skirt with garlic robata\n<mark>Tofu Salad</mark> \"caprese\" with seaweed, tomatoes, and dried fishies", 
            "we love robata grill, so raku seemed a must visit on our latest trip to las vegas.  \n\nfirst, the service at raku was slow.  not just slow, but mind-numbingly slow.  our meal lasted three hours, including an inexplicable half hour delay between the first appetizer of fresh tofu and our next course of blue fin tuna sashimi.  since this was our first visit, i'm not ready to pass judgment.  but in any case, i probably wouldn't recommend you visit raku if you are on a tight timeline.  but if you are going to provide slow service, you better make sure it is good -- and raku came through.  although she steered us to the \"safer\" menu items, our server was friendly, helpful, and, when she was around, attentive.  when she wasn't, we were on our own for large stretches of time, or offered the wrong dish by one of the other servers who consistently confused our table.\n\nhowever, the food overwhelmed any service issues.  it was, in a word, amazing!  we started with the fresh tofu -- it had the consistency of ricotta but what drove it to the next level were the myriad layers of flavor added by the various condiments.  although i never thought i would say it about a \"plain\" tofu dish, this is a must have.\n\nthe blue fish tuna sashimi special was also very good.  it was fresh and delicious but while we enjoyed it, it probably wasn't even close to the level of the tofu.  combine that with the near extinction of blue fin tuna and the price, and it probably won't be on our next order.  same with the sea snail, which was interesting, but not especially flavorful.  and while we are big fans of eel, the unagi teriyaki was not as good as the ones available at other restaurants.\n\nthe fried flying fish and <mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark> reinvigorated our meal.  both were excellent. and the accompanying broth was delicious to the last drop.  it typified our experience at raku, where the multiple layers of texture and flavor combine to create a large complex symphony.  \n\nthe grilled skewers were also great.  the tomato with bacon and enoki mushroom with bacon were exactly why we love robata grill.  the only other vegetable we ordered, the <mark>Crispy Asparagus Okaki</mark>  was also excellent.  the beef outside skirt with garlic was good, the duck with balsamic soy sauce was better, and the foie gras with glazed soy-base sauce was absolutely, melt-in-your-mouth amazing.  the pork cheek was also good, but the pork ear was a little bit to chewy and cartilaginous to be our cup of tea.  surprisingly, the tsukune-grilled ground chicken was bland -- a let down compared to the rest of the meal.\n\nwe finished off with the green tea creme brulee, which was the perfect dessert.  not too rich or thick, it was exactly what we needed after the rich skewers we had just eaten.  and it had the same depth of flavors that we had enjoyed in the other dishes.  i also recommend you try the sake flight.  it was interesting and all of the sakes were excellent -- you can order most of them by the glass, as well as by the bottle, if you find one that you like.\n\noverall, raku was a great, if lengthy experience.  we will try the kaiseki meal (and make sure we have a four hours to spare) the next time we visit.", 
            "i am fully aware of how yelpers in general have an unconditional and unwavering love for this place, just like i'm very aware of the \"yelpers love us\" sticker on the door. the reviews were one of the reasons we decided to come to this place, however, its also one of the few times that i have disagreed with the raving reviews of yelp.\n\nwe came here about 1 am on a wednesday morning and even though there were open seats, they still felt that we should wait before being seated. 10 minutes later, we were seated at one of the open seats.\n\nfrom the onset, the service was a bit slow. our server asked if we were ready to order right away, but we asked for a minute. it was only after about 15 minutes of waiting we decided to flag our server to order. the food also came slowly but that wasn't really the issue.\n\nso down to the food. we ordered:\n\n1) aohata nabe: this was basically a fish stew. this was 40 dollars and my least favorite item that we ordered. it wasn't bad, but it wasn't particularly good either.\n\n2) <mark>Tofu Salad</mark>: this simple item was probably one of my favorites. it's 7 dollars and pretty flavorful with their green tea salt.\n\n3) <mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark>: i know that this item is all that yelpers rave about, and it was good, but cooome on... its not that good! 10 dollars. actually, i thought it was just \"ok.\"\n\n4) <mark>Crispy Asparagus Okaki</mark>. this was actually really good. it tasted like asparagus with japanese cracker crumbs. 5 dollars.\n\n5) <mark>Juicy Deep Fried Chicken</mark>: simple <mark>Juicy Deep Fried Chicken</mark> served much like a sushi roll. these tasted great. 9 dollars.\n\n6) tsukune: the ground chicken was my 2nd least favorite. just very ehh. $3.50.\n\n7) enoki mushroom w/ bacon: this was probably my favorite item of the night, simple yet very tasty. $2.80.\n\n8) scallop w/ soy sauce: the scallop was amazing, especially with the sauce that it comes in. loved this. 7 dollars.\n\nwe tried to order the pork belly but they were out.\n\nall in all, perhaps because of the raving reviews, this place was a slight disappointment. from the slow service to the aohata nabe, things were just a bit off with the whole experience. \n\nthe food, in general, is good, but its not that good. this experience reminds the moment when walking out of the movie theaters after watching hunger games. overrated. i'm saying this as a person that loves japanese food (and i'm not talking about california rolls as japanese food), but real authentic japanese food.\n\nif you're in the mood for tasty no-frills chinese/malaysian food at about 1/6 of the price, go to big wong, only a few feet away from raku.", 
            "i have heard that they have started a kaiseki course, so i have been curious and wanting to try it out, but given that my last experience here was merely a-ok, i have dragged my feet until recently, but here are my thoughts after trying it out.  \n\nfirst of all, kaiseki literally means \"stone in the bosom\".  this originates from zen buddhist monks keeping a warmed stone in the bosom to endure cold and hunger during their training as they were not allowed to eat much in the afternoon.  occasionally they are allowed to eat small portions of rice poridge, and such small meals originated the name \"kaiseki\", as something to wade off hunger.\n\nkaiseki then transformed to offerings during formal tea ceremonies, and then after hundreds of years it has evolved  into what we consider kaiseki ryori now, which is a multi course formal dinner offered almost eclusively in ryoutei,  as it inherits a spirit of the tea ceremony, the focus is on service and offering the best that can be offered at the time to serve the customer, the spirit of \"ichigo ichie\".  \n\nas i consider raku as sort of a high-end izakaya like place, and certainly not a ryoutei, i was curious as to how they can pull off a kaiseki course, but here is how it went.  i had to make the reservation at least 3 days in advance, and the choices were 10 or 15-course dinner, and i was told to expect it to take at least 3 hours.  as i had to arrange for a baby sitter, i just went for a 10 course meal.\n\nin japan, ryoutei or high-end japanese restaurant (something like kiccho comes to mind) serves their guests in private tatami rooms, which isn't quite possible here, but at least they led us to a private room-like space toward the back of the restaurant, which is nice.  it was walled off except for the entrance part, so it is a bit more than a booth to give us some privacy.\n\nwe ordered some bottled water from japan as well as a small bottle of sake as my wife and i don't drink that much, and the course started with yuzu flavored sake aperitif and then:\n1) hotaruika (firefly squid) sumiso-ae\n2) large plate with <mark>Crispy Asparagus Okaki</mark>, salmon with egg yolk, corn/potato, grilled egg plant, grilled duck, yamaimo mousse, and fois <mark>Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard</mark>.  \n3) squid and ikura with uni sauce\n4) soup with chicken tsukune and cherry blossom leaf\n5) sashimi of hatsu-gatsuo (early season bonito) and sayori (japanese half beak)\n6) miso glazed grilled huedai (star snapper)\n7) fried aji (japanese jack mackerel) in dashi with eringi mushrooms\n8) baby abalone\n9) kobe beef steak on hot stone\n10) shima aji namerou with rice and takana (striped jack tartar).\n11) desert of fresh cheese mousse \n\nwhew!!  it sounds like a lot, and it is a lot, but that took us more than 3 hours.  was it good?  yes.  am i thrilled to go back and try it again?  no.  \n\nperhaps that is the reason why i live here and despite all the raves i hear and read about raku, this was my second visit.  \n\ni just think that it was a strech (to say it nicely) to call it kaiseki.  there are a few things that bothered me and distracted from the meal.  \n\nthere was a group of young kids wearing baseball caps, with baggy shorts and wife beaters talking very loudly, dropping f-bombs left and right who were sitting relatively close to us.  although we were in a semi-private booth-like space, this was distracting.  do i blame them?  no, because as i said before, i consider raku to be a high-end izakaya, and not a ryotei.  however, this is not quite the setting that i find appropriate to serve kaiseki, which has zen buddhism and tea ceremony in origin.  it has to be in a serene, zen-like space, and raku is not it.\n\nin any kaiseki, there must be a balance of food from sea/land/mountain.  as you can see on the menu, 7 out of the 10 ingredients are seafood and the balance is hopelessly lacking.\n\none of the very important aspects of serving kaiseki food is \"ma\" or spacing.  3 and a half hours for this meal?  my wife and i felt that this meal dragged way, way too long, and the consideration for ma was absolutely lacking.\n\none other concern was that my wife has a food allergy to shrimps/clams.  i was actually surprised that they didn't ask me that when i made the reservation and i forgot to mention it, but when i mentioned it at dinner, i was told that \"oh, we don't do kaiseki for people with allergies\"....i told them that's ok, as i will be happy to eat her shrimps and clams, and the only thing that she couldn't eat happened to be abalone, no big deal.  however, this strays so so far away from the spirit of kaiseki which should inherit the spirit of \"ichigo-ichie\", which is at the heart of sadou, or tea ceremony as well a zen buddhism.  \n\nin summary, i have a very difficult time calling this meal \"kaiseki\".  the food was good although not exactly \"great\" either, and kaiseki is not only about the food, but more importantly the experience, and as a whole, the experience was lacking and it was not something that i am yearning to go back for more.", 
            "i'll make this brief, because one of the previous reviewers just wrote a very comprehensive review of this little gem of a restaurant! \n\nthe housemade tofu is a revelation! first try it with the special hokkaido sea salt blend, and then with the shredded bonito and scallions and ginger, with a little bit of the homemade soy sauce drizzled on top. wow!\n\nwe tried dishes from all across the menu, from the <mark>Crispy Asparagus Okaki</mark> (fried with a crispy panko? crust) to the delicious kobe skewers -- thank you previous reviewer, you were so right about that beef -- to the whole fish prepared two ways. we chose sea bream, a very small, delicately flavored fish. it came sashimi'd first, then the other half of the fish was grilled. beyond delicious.\n\nmy kids are so jealous because raku had grilled rice balls, a real country-style treat that we used to have all the time when they were children. yum!\n\nthe service and atmosphere were wonderful. we sat in a kaiseiki room, which was an intimate dark wood booth. clientele ranged from locals (we overheard the staff greeting a regular saying they were worried because he always came in at 9 pm and he was a few minutes late!) to a group of japanese businessmen to a couple with a young baby. all were treated excellently and all seemed to really enjoy their experience at raku. we will be back.\n\nnote: it is a small restaurant, with about a dozen tables, so be sure to call in advance for reservations. it is a short taxi ride from the strip hotels, and the staff at the restaurant was more than happy to call a taxi for us at the end of our meal.", 
            "since this place is on so many \"top ten\" lists, i thought for sure that i was going to get a very expensive, maybe good experience. very pleased to be wrong on that front! staff was very helpful when explaining the menu and the items were all well prepared and extremely tasty. the standouts were the raku's tofu (get the full order--we got the half and ended up ordering it twice), the <mark>Sashimi Salad</mark> (very generous for the price), the duck with balsamic soy glaze, the enoki mushrooms with bacon and the <mark>Crispy Asparagus Okaki</mark>. we stuck mostly with the skewers and were surprisingly full given the small bites. and our check was not astronomical--a plus! this is now on our list of places to go in vegas.", 
            "small tiny place that you have to make reservations for way in advance. my mom made a reservation for us 2 weeks in advance, and if you're late..within 15 minutes they will give your table to somebody else. \n\nlocated in a small tiny corner in chinatown. we got there about 10 minutes before our reservation time, but we were assisted to sit down right away. the food itself takes quite a long time to arrive. we were there for almost 2 hours. it took about a good 45 minutes for the first plate to come out. \n\ni actually prefer shin sen gumi yakitori over this place. the taste isn't as strong as theirs. but, overall it's pretty good. \n\npopeye salad $8- spinach and bacon (mainly), decently good. a little too salty, but a good salad nonetheless!\n\n<mark>Crispy Asparagus Okaki</mark> $5- delicious. super crunchy, and it actually tasty cheesy! nom nom. \n\n<mark>Juicy Deep Fried Chicken</mark> $9- not a favorite. didn't have too much flavor to it, and it was strangely chewy. slightly warm as well. \n\n<mark>Fried Ice Fish</mark> $8.50- frowning as i write this. i don't like fish, and i don't like seeing multiple tiny fishes fried up whole. i ate like 3.. d: no gusta.\n\n<mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark> $11- pretty good! i just didn't like the fish eggs inside, but overall it was a good and flavored dish!\n\nmomo chicken thigh $2.75 each- err, it was a little too pink for my liking, and it was kind of fatty. it was okay \n\ntsukune $3.50 each- shin sen's is much tastier. this one comes as like a drumstick, and i had to keep adding more togarashi. not enough sauce. \n\nharami kobe beef skirt $7.50 each- delicious! comes with grunchy garlic chips. mmm, super tasty!\n\nyakionigiri $5.00 (comes with 2)- it was..okay. lol\n\nscallop with soy sauce $7.00- not sure how this tasted. didn't eat this one!\n\nasparagus with bacon $3.00- comes with 3 pieces, pretty good. \n\nasahi $7.00\n\numeshu $12.00 (super delicious!)\n\noverall, the flavor was almost there, and i didn't think it was the greatest.", 
            "my newest vegas obsession!  loved the food. hard to get in but worth the wait. definitely call for reservations.  \n\nwe picked several dishes from the menu but i plan to go back and try their omakase. the homemade tofu was amazing!  i prefer the raku over the agedashi, but both were great. the <mark>Crispy Asparagus Okaki</mark> and enoki wrapped in bacon were yummy. the <mark>Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard</mark> was rich but so good. \n\nwe were happily stuffed and only spent about $80 for 2 people and had sake.  great prices!  i can definitely spending more but mostly on sake!  the only thing we didn't try was the dessert :(  we were just too full... everything was so good we couldn't let any of the food go to waste.", 
            "since my initial visit during their first year opened, i've been back a handful of times and felt it was time i updated my review.  \n\nraku is the kind of place we usually reserve for special occasions and recommend to out of town guests.  our most recent visit was only last week as the husband and i celebrated our five year wedding anniversary.\n\nwe attempted to make reservations on the same day and the only opening they had was at 9:00 pm.  we did a walk in to hopefully land a cancellation spot or two of the coveted five counter seats, and it was only a 30 minute wait for the counter seats!  sweet!  but yes, make reservations way in advance, especially if you have a larger party or it's a weekend.\n\nthe thing to look out for is the specials board.  they usually list about 5-6 items on there that range from raw to cooked items.  the weirdest part about this board is that it will change during your visit there.  during our 2-3 hour dinner, we saw some things sell out and get replaced with something else.  the waitstaff doesn't mention the newer items, so it's something you just have to look out for.  (for example, oysters were not listed on the specials board but the party sitting next to us ended up ordering the last giant oyster.  they were seated after us and only knew about it because the oyster was sitting on ice right in front of them!  they had squid on ice too, but it wasn't listed on the specials board!)  so, not only are you keeping your eyes out for the changing specials board but you have to see what's fresh and on ice that day!  we do get a few cooked items and although they are good, the raw fish choices are always the best!\n\nthese days we skip the robata grill items, not because they aren't tasty but we like to focus on the more unique items.  \n\none of our most favorite items is the <mark>Crispy Asparagus Okaki</mark> ($5).  it's a simple asparagus that's been dredged in rice crackers and deep-fried.  i don't know why it's so good but it just is.  and when you add a little of their matcha salt, oh my gawd!  i just love it.\n\nanother item we had on this last visit include the <mark>Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard</mark> ($10).  there's a piece of duck that lays on top of this dish, and it's actually duck liver they use, not goose.  the foie gras is already mixed in with the egg, so it gives the whole dish a rich egg taste.  \n\n<mark>Poached Egg</mark> with sea urchin and salmon roe ($9) is another unusual pairing, mostly because of the mountain yam that gives this dish a slimy texture.  you break up the egg and mix it all together, but you can't help but notice the slimy effect from the mountain yam.  it's a tasty nonetheless.  \n\nthe kobe beef liver sashimi ($9.50) is something that not everyone would enjoy.  the husband isn't usually a fan of liver, except served foie gras style, but he was game.  and it did still lend a livery taste, but it's something that you have to try once.\n\ni always enjoy homemade tofu and raku's tofu (whole $5.50) does not disappoint.  they server theirs with bonito shavings, ginger, and scallions.\n\nthe four condiments placed on every table should not go ignored, especially the green tea salt and their own soy sauce.  yum!\n\nsince they expanded, their bathrooms are indeed something to look at.  first off, it's so clean and pristine and holds one of the cleanest fish tanks you'll ever see on spring mountain! \n\nservice on our last few visits have been much better compared to my first visit.  the waitress that took care of us at the counter never let my water glass go empty and she was always letting us know when our food was coming so we weren't waiting too long and giving us clean plates too.\n\nmy only real gripe was this: although i usually love sitting at the counter so i can watch the chefs at work, i also can't overlook things that probably shouldn't be seen by dining guests.  one of the prep guys at the counter sneezed into his hands and continued prepping the food.  i was totally turned off by this, especially because there was a sink right behind him.  it wasn't too long after when the husband said to me that we weren't going to be ordering anymore cold foods.  when i inquired as to why, he said he noticed the same prep guy just cough into his hands and continue working.  yes, a sneeze and cough into the very bare hands that were prepping the food.  yuck.\n\nnonetheless, we still do love raku and would continue recommending it.  but alas, those basic hygiene issues need to be addressed!  \n\n4.5 stars.", 
            "raku is one of the best japanese restaurants i've been to and way better than most japanese restaurants in san francisco.  everything prepared on the robata grill is exquisite - everything finishes with a smoky finish.  i especially loved the ibarico pork, duck breast with balsamic vinegar. other items like the <mark>Crispy Asparagus Okaki</mark>, onsen tamago with uni and ikura, <mark>Sashimi Salad</mark>, agedashi handmade tofu, foie gras don - all delicious.  very nice staff - service is japanese specialty.", 
            "i was so thrilled to try this place out, but i didn't leave here super pleased. :(\n\nbefore i start this review, i must say that i am not a fan of seafood aka raw fish aka fish aka most of the things on the menu. i prefer cooked foods, chicken, vegetables and red meat. so dun, dun dun, i tried the hiyashi chawanushi, <mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark>, <mark>Crispy Asparagus Okaki</mark>, <mark>Juicy Deep Fried Chicken</mark>, kobe beef filet, kobe beef skirt, grilled duck, and eggplant. \n\nhiyashi chawanushi: this dish was a daily special. i believe it was an <mark>Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard</mark> with crab and something else on top. like i said above, i'm not a fan of seafood, and this dish had such a fishy taste to it. i gagged a little after trying it, and i couldn't get rid of the fishy taste it left in my mouth. we left 90% of it left, because the dish itself was overwhelming.\n\n<mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark>: i have to agree with all the other yelpers. the best and most fresh tofu. get this!\n\n<mark>Crispy Asparagus Okaki</mark>: this dish comes with pieces of asparagus breaded with rice cracker. very delectable. \n\n<mark>Juicy Deep Fried Chicken</mark>: the best dish. like its name, it was six pieces of extremely mouthwatering chicken on a bed of spinach. the chicken itself was superb. the spinach and the sauce complimented the chicken. i definitely recommend this!\n\nkobe beef filet with wasabi/kobe beef skirt with garlic: very nice cuts of kobe beef. i liked the garlic one more, because all i could taste was wasabi and no meat. \n\ngrilled duck: i can't remember much about the duck except for its tangy aftertaste and chewiness. bleh, i guess i was expecting something different. thank goodness they present each table with tea afterwards, because i could not stand the aftertaste.\n\neggplant. grilled eggplant sprinkled with a ton of dried ginger. the eggplant was soft and appetizing, but the ginger ruined it for me. the ginger itself has a strong flavor, and i thought there was just too much ginger on there. i still ate it, but i took off most of the ginger.  \n\nof the eight dishes, i would only come back for the tofu, asparagus and <mark>Juicy Deep Fried Chicken</mark>. maybe we just ordered the wrong things, but i would not come back here. :c", 
            "so much food, not enough belly room!  this dining establishment is a hidden gem located within a busy plaza in chinatown.  i had called weeks prior to the date of arrival trying to get a reservation.  unfortunately, no one picked up my three phone call attempts on various days.  that was very disappointing.  \n\non saturday night, the gf and i decided to come here in hopes of scoring a table without reservations.  we were greeted by the hostess, and she said we would be able to sit at the bar in about ten minutes.  five minutes pass and we ask her if we would be able to get a table instead.  she says no, and that they are booked for the night.  then, a couple minutes later, she tells us someone who made reservations did not show up!  \n\nthe menu is one page, front and back, with lots of options that will make your mouth water.  we decided on the infamous <mark>Rakus Tofu</mark>, <mark>Juicy Deep Fried Chicken</mark>, <mark>Crispy Asparagus Okaki</mark>, corn potato, butter sauted scallop, foie gras don, soboro don, and the waygu beef sashimi.  \n\nthe tofu was no joke.  it was the freshest i have ever eaten.  the ingredients used to pair  with the tofu complimented each other perfectly.  make sure to try the green tea salt because that is what the chef recommended first.  out of all the dishes, the plating on this one was the most creative.  the asparagus came next, accompanied by the corn potato.   the asparagus coated in the tempura batter was mind blowing.  the outside was so crunchy, and was a pleasant surprise.  the corn potato was my favorite dish.  never could a dish be so simple, yet so elegantly presented.  i do not know how they did it, but hats off to them.  \n\nnext up was the waygu beef sashimi, buttered scallop, andthe <mark>Juicy Deep Fried Chicken</mark>.  the waygu slices were ultra thin, and such top tier cuts.  i practically ate the whole thing, and still wanted more!  the scallop was served on its shell, and the light sauce drizzled on top was very good.  the scallop itself was a tad bit chewy, and there were two hard mystery pieces that needed to be spat out.  the juicy, <mark>Juicy Deep Fried Chicken</mark> was very good.  although i wished it had been more crispy, it was definitely juicy.  i would have enjoyed it more had there been no chewy tendons in some bites.  \n\nthe foie gras don and soboro don came out last.  the foie gras was everything one could hope for, and so much more.  the buttery duck was well worth the wait.  the sauce that went with it was so good.  the soboro don was just okay.  i could have done without the pickled mustard, and there was no sauce to go with the dish.  \n\noverall, i am definitely impressed by this place.  i will also have to check out raku sweets as well!", 
            "what can i say that has not already been said. this place is awesome!\n\nwith that being said, i tried about half the items on the menu and here is my personal verdict. i liked the tofu, anyway you go it's all good! hiyashi style, agedofu style, or oyaji dofu, try them all, there all good! also the kobe beef skewer with wasabi on top, the bomb!!! also, i      won't eat sashimi unless it's off the boat kine fresh. all of their sashimi was super fresh, how can you do that in the middle of the desert? and how can i forget to mention that the <mark>Crispy Asparagus Okaki</mark> was super good, culinary magic!! the only gripe that i might have is that the foie gras on the foie gras chawan mushi was a little bit over cooked (chotto katakatta nei), but flavor was super good. i highly recommend this restaurant. i can go on forever, but i felt that each dish was made with \"aijo\" or with heart and love.\n\ni also want to give a shout out to johnathon the server, my \"hafu\" brother i met in vegas! you know the deal johnathon we \"hafu\" stick together. johnathon explained each dish that was brought to the table, and gave tips on the best or recommended way to enjoy each dish. he is a true asset to raku and serves their food with pride. ask for him as your your server.\n\ni am from hawaii and grew up in japan and can truly say this is some of the best food i have ever tasted in my life! thanks raku, i will see you again!"

            "my wife found out about this place through mixi which is kind of like a japanese myspace.  its only been open for 3 weeks and we've wanted to try another izakaya style place besides ichiza (which was packed for memorial day) so we gave this place a go.\n\nthe place is a bit small, not great for groups of over 4 but the atmosphere wasn't bad.  i guess i prefer jpop over koto music but it was fine.  their specialty is their yakitori (grilled on a stick) type stuff.  we went w/ the chicken thigh ($2 a piece), wasabi kobe beef ($9), asparagus bacon ($2) and the tsukune which is grilled ground chicken on a stick.  everything we had tasted awesome.  not sure what they're putting in their grill for the flavoring but its fantastic and addictive.  \n\nyou can definitely tell that the ingredients used here are of higher quality than ichiza but the menu is a lot smaller and aside from the yakitori, pricier too.  \n\nofcourse we weren't full from all the above so we tried some of the rice dishes along with oden (a winter food boiled in a soup..kinda like a hot pot).  my wife got the tororo don which is gooey potato mixed w/ soy sauce that she loves but i find inedible while i had the ikura don which is salmon roe eggs w/ seaweed on rice.  both of these cost around $10 a piece and the portions were pretty small.  just one small bowl of rice w/ the topping.  definitely disappointed w/ that.  my wife was also bummed that they didn't have natto.  \n\nthe oden was tasty though.  we ordered the chikuwa (fish stick), konnyaku and daikon which were all around $1.50-$2 a piece.\n\nthey only have sapporo beer but they do have a nice list of sake, shochu and wines which would make this a nice place for some beverages and small food.  i would also recommend just buying the pitcher of beer at $22 a pop as opposed to the $5 glass if your party plans on drinking at least 4 glasses.  you get a whole lot more w/ the pitcher!!!!!  \n\nthe bathroom was funny too as they only have a single unisex stall but they put a bunch of fake flowers on the ceiling w/ a speaker playing bird noises the entire time.  priceless.  \n\noverall, i would rate this place 3.5 stars but its closer to 4 than 3.   i am just sticking to the grilled stuff the next time we go back as the rice dish portions are way too overpriced.  a few tables ordered the <mark>Juicy Deep Fried Chicken</mark> ($8) which looked awesome too so maybe we'd get that next time.  they're open til 3am which is cool.  most patrons there were japanese..i think i was 1 out of 3 that weren't. \n\nso yeah..this is a good alternative to ichiza although i wouldn't say its better...just different.", 
            "full review w/ pics in blog.\n\nbeginning first with some appetizers my first choice was <mark>Poached Egg</mark> with sea urchin and salmon roe.  arriving after a short wait and in an ample portion the dish consisted of a cool broth with a warm <mark>Poached Egg</mark> paired with a creamy uni tongue and given a myriad of flavors and textures from a \"soup\" of snappy mountain yams, earthy hon-shimeji mushrooms, salty salmon roe, and pungent green onions.  breaking the egg and stirring the broth it thickened quickly giving the whole dish a mellow and creamy texture that paired beautifully with the fresh uni and other ingredients - at $7 this may have been the most affordable uni i'd ever experienced with such great taste and honestly i would go back to raku just to experience this dish again.\n\narriving shortly after my first plate was finished - and with an explanation of all the little jars and bottles in front of me (a matcha sea salt, a house made soy, a japanese pepper + rice vinegar, and a chili infused oil) - seafood with bonito guts pickled in salt looked and smelled much better than the name would arouse in one's imagination.  as others have mentioned, i really do not understand how this dish was a mere $6.  a heaping bowl filled with a mix of sashimi yellowfin, jackfish, salmon, mackerel, and sprouts each fish was extremely fresh and the sprouts lent some texture to the fleshy-melt-in-your-mouth fishes.  topping the dish, according to my young server, was a combination of the house soy and the vinegar.  adding a bit more soy to the already salty mix made the flavor perfect, in my opinion, though i do believe the dish could have benefited from some daikon or perhaps a crisp starch to add a bit more texture.\n\nthe next dish - well, let's just say it was so good that i ordered a second portion as my main course.  entitled simply <mark>Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard</mark> with foie gras the dish looked simple enough - a miso broth with scallions and a piece of robata duck floating in the broth.  what laid beneath the broth, however, was the true treasure of the dish - a rich and hearty chawanmushi (<mark>Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard</mark>) laden with ample accents of foie gras.  when stirred up with the wooden spoon the foie tones rose amply to the palate with the whole dish tasting like the combination of a sweet <mark>Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard</mark> and an unctuous foie gras terrine.  while the grilled duck added a fine degree of texture to the dish, i personally thought the duck was a slight bit gamey - not bad, just not perfect.  \n\nseeing this dish also offered in the noodle section as an udon accompaniment i inquired from my server as to whether i could get that dish as a main course, but instead substitute the robata foie gras for the duck.  not quite understanding my question my server went and got another server who understood perfectly, asked the chef, and assured me this would be no problem.  receiving this dish after my robata choices and just before dessert i would strongly suggest anyone who attends raku try this substitution for two reasons - number one, the manner in which the robata grill's high temperatures crisps the foie gras exterior while leaving the center fatty and smooth is unlike anything i've previously experienced - the charring actually mellows the foie all on its own and the texture is more \"firm,\" not unlike the roasted version i had at blackbird in chicago, actually.  number two - those udon noodles served thin and cold to be dunked into a broth of foie gras, <mark>Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard</mark>, and more foie gras...think \"chicken soup\" in its perfect form.\n\nbetween my two foie dishes i decided to indulge in a couple of raku's robata skewers - chicken breast with skin.  fresh organic chicken wrapped in its own skin and cooked to crispy this dish presented some of the most <mark>Juicy Deep Fried Chicken</mark> i've had in some time while the addition of the skin added a crisp \"crackle\" without any breading - better than the colonel without all the carbs and oil.  adding first the soy and then the salt i have to say i was quite impressed by the manner in which the matcha's bitter texture worked with the savorieness of the chicken and salt.\n\nrobata course two was kurobuta pork cheek and it, like the chicken, was excellent.  typically quite fatty the high heat of the grill managed to melt the collagen perfectly while burning off some of the fat and only mildly crisping the skin.  the 'rarest' pork i've had since the chop at babbo i found this to be my favorite, tastewise, of the robtata items and would compare it favorably to some of the better pork belly dishes i've had in terms of taste, texture, and fat to meat ratio.\n\nthe third robata course was something i've never eaten - pigs ears.  sure i've had trotters, tail, tete, belly, cheek, and all the standard cuts - but not ear.  as others have stated - wow.  crispy and salty on the outside, fatty next, and a thin chewy layer of cartilage in the middle - almost a 5-layer sandwich with each layer giving a different taste and texture experience.", 
            "i finally made it here!!!!  i went with a group of 6, so we got a chef's tasting menu for $35 per head (pretty sweet deal).  i got the roasted green iced tea to start.  the food just kept coming so i hope i can remember it all.  i will have to come back with less than 5 people so i can order a la carte next time.\n\nwhen i got here, i sort of recognized the sushi chef, and he looked at me, but i could not place him.  he came out to talk to me, and remembered me from being a regular at the ka before the ka went waaaay downhill more than a year ago!  i was impressed.  his name is hiro.  he was so kind and also came out to greet me before i left.\n\nblah i know everyone has read that i don't eat pork, so i let everyone else eat the bacon-wrapped asparagus and pork cheek.  i did eat everything else though...fluke sashimi with ankimo (fish liver) and crunchy part of fish with spicy daikon, green onions, and ponzu.  sliced thin like you see fugu sliced.  what's not to like?  homemade tofu (like velvety cream) \"caprese\" with seaweed and tomatoes, <mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark> with ikura, fish gutted at our table with daikon then the bones and head were fried and returned, skewered chicken wrapped in its skin - sooo juicy, skewered tender medium rare beef with garlic chips, nut-crusted tempura asparagus, <mark>Juicy Deep Fried Chicken</mark> skin with spinach leaves and miso..the grand finale was a rice dish served in this big pot where the bottom crisped up the rice (we likey!!) with ikura, salmon flake, green onions, veggies...mmmmmm!!!  i am probably missing something.  we got hot tea at the end too.  service was great, place is really small and intimate.  extra points for matcha salt and shichimi togarashi on the tables!!!  i will definitely come back (who wouldn't?)", 
            "love this place! i've been here twice in the last month or so and each visit gets better and better! \n\nmy favs:\n- <mark>Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard</mark> with foie gras\n- fried homemade tofu in hot broth\n- <mark>Juicy Deep Fried Chicken</mark>\n- chicken breast wrapped with chicken skin\n- potato with corn\n- fluffy cheesecake\n\nyou can easily spend over $50 for two people here but the food is yummy. make sure you book a reservation! the place is a bit small but  i didn't mind since the food speaks for itself. raku, you got me at moshi moshi!", 
            "raku is the type of restaurant that takes you out of vegas and into a corner restaurant in japan.  this is the most authentic japanese cuisine that we've tried, and a nice change from the regular japanese ramen and tempura that i usually love.\n\nfirst, the other yelpers are right--you do need a reservation to eat there, not matter what the day or time.  they are only open for dinner and open till 3am, so call that same day or in advance.  even if one seat is open and you come in without a reservation they may turn you away, so keep that in mind.\n\nwe walked in at 730 this evening and it was a full restaurant.  i assumed that it would be a yakitori restaurant, so i checked the menu and ordered a few things, which i'll go through in a minute.  first, the drinks were limited if you aren't drinking sake or beer.  according to our server, all they had for soda was coke, so my husband had a coke and i had water.  they explained all the specials of the day and their sake specials as well, giving us a few minutes to go through the menu.  \n\ntheir menu isn't large, so it's easy to choose a variety of things to try.  their appetizers are very familiar to me because we went through japan and had some of these things like cow intestines and sea urchin.  the grilled menu is nice and short, but with lots of variety, as is their soup and rice bowl sections.  here's what we ordered:\n\n-<mark>Juicy Deep Fried Chicken</mark> appetizer: very interesting.  they roll a boneless breast up with the skin on and deep fry it till the skin is almost dark brown.  i believe it's marinated slightly in shoyu, so it had good flavor.\n\n-asparagus tempura: it's my favorite thing out of the entire night!  the coating is small squares of potato or something.  it was delicious!!!\n\n-potato is dashi: very good broth.  you can't go wrong with dashi and we ate the potato with a spoon.  very good, and very light.  a wonderful starter.\n\n-kobe with wasabi: extremely tender and not overpowered with any seasoning.  the flavor of the meat is savory and lovely.  i couldn't see the marbling cause it was grilled well done, but very good.  the wasabi gave it that heat, which was a nice combination.\n\n-chicken breast: not on a stick like the kobe but sliced and served with a shoyu sauce.  very tender and very well seasoned.  here's the thing--in japan they serve chicken half done in most yakitori places on the street, so when this came with the chicken having a pink center i didn't mind.  if you're the type to shy away from medium-well chicken, this may not be your dish. \n\n-duck with balsamic: very nicely grilled so that the duck fat was crispy and melt-in-your-mouth good.  the balsamic was a perfect pairing with the green onion.  very good yakitori.\n\n-scallop in butter and miso: very tender, lovely butter flavor and the sauce was excellent.  served on the scallop's half shell, too.\n\n-yellowtail: very good and had the usual sauce on it, too. i love grilled yellowtail so this was nice.  some people think it's sacrilege to do that to yellowtail, but it's really, really good.\n\n-<mark>Fried Ice Fish</mark>: these are small fish, smaller then sardines and they tempura them.  they come in a bowl and it was yummy.  as long as you don't mind eating the little black eyes and tail, you should try it.  i liked it. salty and you can squeeze some lime on there.  \n\n-bite size chicken and egg bowl: it looks gross, to be honest, but the flavors are excellent. the rice with the sauce reminds me of how rice tastes when you mix bulgogi sauce in it.  i liked it.  warning: the egg is placed on the rice raw and then cooked chicken on top with more egg, so it's not fully cooked egg.  it's partially gelatinous still, so if you're weary of that, just a warning.\n\neverything tasted good and i even ordered another round of the asparagus tempura.  i wanted their fluffy cheesecake, but it takes 20 minutes to make, so if you want to try it when you go order it in advance.\n\noverall, it was a nice flashback of japan and a good experience.  would i go back?  probably not.  our tab was 100 bucks and some change, something i can't go spend daily.  for 2 people that was a lot of food, mind you, but still--i don't like paying 2-9 dollars for one skewer or one scallop.  \n\nin terms of service, it's fairly good. they clear you table throughout the whole experience, which is nice.  you need to put your glass out to the outside of the table to get refills of water, but you must ask for refills on coke.  it's by the bottle.  we had to ask for our check once, and when it didn't come we just gave another server our credit card.  other than that, their service during the entire meal is really good.  they even walk you out the door, which i thought was pleasant.\n\nif i want yakitori, i'll go to shisen, but if you want that authentic japanese experience you have to try this place.  it's good, but  the only thing i loved was the asparagus appetizer.  sorry to say, but the rest was just okay for me, but the flavor profiles were really good. \n\ntry it once.", 
            "this is my favorite restaurant in vegas. keep in mind i don't live here and haven't gotten to try everything but still hands down my favorite.  \n\nlike my friend heinz says, \"i'll bet on raku anytime against any japanese restaurant in the united states...  that's how awesome raku is!\" heinz introduced me and now every trip i go there i have to eat there. the best part is that it's open late!\n\nrumor has it, chef's from the restaurants on the strip go here to eat afterwards, and they were even offered to open up in one of the casinos but the owner preferred off-strip and turned down the offer.\n\nhere are my recommendations:\n- make reservations or you will be salivating in line\n- beef tendon: these are the best beef tendons ever. not only do they melt in your mouth but they have the grill taste infused. we order 8 typically. yes i'm serious, that good!\n- pork cheeks: sounds bad tastes awesome\n- bacon wrapped tomatoes: it's wrapped in bacon need i say more?\n- <mark>Juicy Deep Fried Chicken</mark>: asian like me and like dark meat? this one is for you. don't get bamboozled with the chicken breast w/ wrapped skin. <mark>Juicy Deep Fried Chicken</mark> better\n- agadashi tofu: homemade tofu good/healthy\n- fresh homemade tofu in hot broth: like the 1st but better because fried and in soup broth.\n- yellow tail carpaccio: good fresh!\n- specials: flown in tuna from japan - if they have this get it, it's better than toro.\n- bathroom: you got to use it, feels like you step into a tranquil garden with birds chirping and fake flowers but real rose petals on the floor. remember \"coming to america\" and rose petals?  you will see...\n\ni'm making myself hungry for it now.... i never go to vegas and not visit raku, it's that good. time to take another vegas trip!\n\nthey're really busy from when they open at 6 pm to 11 pm -- so if you want to chat with the chef or staff, come late. read heinz's post if you want more elegant descriptions.", 
            "little treats that really wakes your palate...\n\na friend of mine brought me here to try, he had read in the papers that the big casino chefs on the strip come here to unwind after work cuz the food is good.\n\nwell this place is totally delicious... we had this grilled mushroom with a pinch of salt on top, that's it just that, and it was just delicious. somehow the salt just blends slowly as you chew the mushroom and gives you a hint here and there, just enough to remind you it's not just plain mushroom, it's just masterfully done...\n\nthe <mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark>, wonderful, home made tofu, one big whole lump, deep fried, in a well balanced broth, and a hit of gojujang on the side of the bowl, nice touch, by far my favorite agedashi...\n\nthe pork belly tender in a sauce, just melts in your mouth, it's fatty so if you don't like fatty steer clear.\n\n<mark>Poached Egg</mark> with see urchin, just delicate food with soft texture, it's just like the food is caressing your tongue...\n\nthe <mark>Juicy Deep Fried Chicken</mark>, is hella crispy, it's breast cut thin then folded onto itself behind the skin then fried till crispy, crispy outside and tender just done inside, hmmm\n\npork cheek skewer, succulent, grilled to perfection, has a bit of fat on it, makes it flavorful, the fat also gets a bit crispy which is a nice touch, this one though eat while it's still hot, don't let the fat get cold...\n\nthere are specials nightly, the grilled squid is quite fresh and tender and sweet.\n\na must if you like izakaya food.", 
            "raku is one of the most unique restaurants you will find in las vegas.  the location is in a small strip-mall in chinatown, an area west of the strip that has become a sort of hotspot for favorite restaurants of local foodies.  not only is raku in a very small strip-mall, but it's located in the very back corner of the strip-mall, barely visible from the road.  the restaurant is very small, maybe 15 tables at most, and is usually very crowded, so make sure to make reservations.  \n\nwhile i have had one very bad experience here due to the service, i am too loyal to great food to hate this restaurant.  i also have had too many great experiences here to let bad service ruin it for me.  but nonetheless, this should be an example of how good the food is here.  it is what brought me back after that bad experience, and i am glad it did.  \n\nthe food at raku is amazing, that's the best way i can put it.  the menu mostly consists of different skewers of meats, seafood, and vegetables.  all of them are made with the highest quality ingredients, and simply grilled over japanese charcoal grills.  it won't sound fancy, but the flavors are so profound and so noticeable that you will appreciate their simplicity.  i have dined at raku around 10 times now, and have compiled a list of my favorite dishes to get here.  \n-<mark>Yellowtail Carpaccio</mark>: thin slices of raw yellowtail, much like sashimi.  my favorite yellowtail comes from ichiza, but every time i come to raku, i question if this is my favorite.  either way, it will be some of the best yellowtail you have ever had, so definitely try it.  \n-duck w/ balsamic soy\n-foie gras: some of the best foie gras i've ever had, and that's saying a lot.  \n-kobe outside skirt w/ garlic: toasted garlic on top of the very flavorful skirt steak.  \n-kobe beef filet w/ wasabi: one of the best things on the menu.  fresh wasabi grated on top of the very tender, flavorful filet.  get this!\n-kurobuta pork cheek: some of the best pork you will eat.  the small layers of fat are caramelized perfectly on the grill, creating a lot of great flavor in the meat. \n-lamb chop\n-yellowtail: simply grilled yellowtail that is very tender, and perfectly cooked.  fish of this quality needs no sauce as it melts in your mouth.  \n-salmon: just like the yellowtail, melts in your mouth.  \n-chicken breast wrapped in skin: chicken that is wrapped in its own skin and grilled until the skin is crispy.  \n-juicy, deep-<mark>Juicy Deep Fried Chicken</mark>\n-chicken thigh\n\nthere are many other great items, but these are the staple items that i think are a must.  the only problem with raku is that it can get very expensive.  the portions of each skewer are not very large, and you will need several to get full.  the prices are anywhere from $2 for each chicken thigh skewer to $14 for the foie gras.  so when you get a lot of these skewers, it can add up.  i usually come to raku for a special occasion, or a time that i am expecting to spend around $50-$75/ person.  and to be honest, it could easily end up being $100/ person if you want sake, and they have a very good selection of sake.  \n\ndo not bring your own wine in, as they do not allow it, and are very stubborn about not allowing it, as well.  their wine list is terrible, yet for some reason they refuse to have a corkage fee.  when we went in one time, they tried to tell us it was illegal, which was clearly a lie because i've brought wine into many restaurants around las vegas, including other places in chinatown.  but just know ahead of time to either drink sake, or drink bad wine.  they definitely won't let you bring your own.  \n\nthe service can be very good or very bad.  as is the case with many asian restaurants, the service is not very good unless you are asian or a regular.  i've had bad service here, and i've had pretty good service here, but service doesn't matter too much as long as i can get my foie gras!  \n\nand much like most of the other best restaurants in chinatown, raku is open very late, until 2 am i believe.  so \"it's getting late\" isn't an excuse not to go here.", 
            "awesome japanese food. recommend it for a late night dinner. get the fried tofu in broth and the crispy <mark>Juicy Deep Fried Chicken</mark> appetizer. surprised how fresh and tasty their sashimi was. only a 15 minute cab ride from city center.", 
            "i'm stoked that my 100th review will be for such a great restaurant!\n\ni have been wanting to try raku ever since i heard about it. the first couple times we tried to go, we called that day and they were booked until way past my bedtime. so we decided to plan ahead and made reservations a couple of weeks in advance. i wanted to make sure and try the best items so when we made our reservations, i requested the $75 omakase dinner. \n\nfor our first course we had the <mark>Sashimi Salad</mark>. this was one of my favorites of the night. it came with 2 dressings, one spicy and one sweet. the fish was high quality. the crisp onions on top provided a nice flavor and textural contrast. it was a lovely way to start our meal.\n\nnext we were served raku's tofu. they make their own tofu and it comes with bonito, green onion, and ginger. the waitress suggested using the green tea salt and soy sauce to season it as well. the soy sauce is homemade and has a slightly sweet flavor. the tofu had a creamy, smooth texture. i never imagined imagined eating plain tofu and liking it, but i did.\n\nfor our third course we had <mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark> which was deep fried tofu in a miso broth topped with salmon roe. it was exceptional. this was another of my favorites of the night. i don't know how they make tofu so delicious!\n\nnext up was grilled tomatoes. they had a nice charcoal grill flavor.\n\ncourse 5 was <mark>Juicy Deep Fried Chicken</mark>. it was served on a bed of spinach and had awesome crispy skin with sesame. it was indeed juicy and very tasty.\n\nwe then had asparagus with bacon. it consisted of 3 small spears of asparagus wrapped in bacon. the bacon had a nice smoky grilled flavor.\n\nour seventh course was butter sauteed scallop with soy sauce. the scallop was nicely cooked and the sweet soy sauce complemented the dish nicely. this was in my wife's top three dishes.\n\nour next dish was yellowtail with glazed soy-based sauce. it was served with minced radish. the radish made the dish go from good to great. it was a perfect pairing.\n\nnext up was chicken wrapped with skin. it was salty and was a great contrast to the previous slightly sweet courses. the skin was sinfully good.\n\nwe then were served kurobuta pork cheek. it was chewy and reminded me of steak fat. that might not sound appetizing, but it was really good.\n\nfor our 11th course we had kobe beef outside skirt with garlic. my wife loved how the garlic chips complemented by the beef. i liked it too, but by this time i was getting full.\n\nnext was another of my favorites, <mark>Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard</mark>. the custard was beautifully cooked. it was served in a delicious broth. though i was getting full by now, i couldn't stop eating it.\n\nafter that we were served tsukune grilled ground chicken. it looked like a chicken sausage. i was stuffed so i only ate a bite and took the rest home.\n\nwe then were given grilled rice balls. one was flavored with soy sauce and the other with miso. i only had a bite and packed the rest.\n\nlastly, we were given two desserts. first up was green tea creme br\\u00fbl\\u00e9e. the green tea ice cream was subtly flavored and just slightly sweet. it was a nice balance to creme br\\u00fbl\\u00e9e.\n\nour other dessert was cheesecake. it had raspberries hidden inside. i love raspberries, and when i ate the raspberry sitting on top of the cheesecake i exclaimed, \"that's a nice raspberry!\"  the cheesecake was fluffy and airy. it was served with a delicious raspberry sauce and green tea salt.\n\nplaying in the background was japanese elevator music, including a rendition of michael jackson's \"beat it\" which was pretty neat.\n\nthe bathroom has artificial grass on the floor, a fake tree growing up the wall, foliage on the ceiling, birds playing in the background, and flower petals on the floor. a must see!\n\nthe meal was definitely delicious, but i think we should have gone with a $50 omakase meal as there were about five too many courses. i well definitely go back! can't wait to try my favorites again and sample some new dishes!", 
            "raku continues to impress each and every time.  i took my fianc\\u00e9 for his birthday and chose the secret menu option of omakase.  okay, okay, it's not really secret, but i love calling unlisted menu options \"secret\".  i like pretend that i'm part of a secret foodie society of delicious food.  my first visit a couple years back was perfect.  this last visit just solidified how amazing raku can be in terms of the consistency and quality of its food.  it also helps that the service is always very efficient and friendly.\n\nfor omakase, there are three tiers to choose from $50/$75/$125.  being that it was it was for his birthday, i decided to go middle baller style - $75!\n\n1.  saba/mackerel sashimi - mackerel doesn't have the same reputation of its fatty counterpart of oh toro, but leave it to raku to take it up to to the highest notch of freshness.  just a tiny dab of wasabi and the tiniest dab of their house made soy sauce was the perfect combination of flavor.\n2.  <mark>Sashimi Salad</mark> with baby spinach, salmon, yellowtail - the best <mark>Sashimi Salad</mark> ever because the fish was perfectly fresh, the spinach perfectly crisp, the soy sauce dressing combined with deep fried onions (?) was texturally and flavor wise on point!\n3.  house tofu (chilled) with side of bonito flakes - we had this with a little bit of green tea infused salt.  this was our least favorite of the night because we usually like our tofu with sauce, so it was a little dry for our tastes.  however, for a purist tofu lover, this is probably a good dish to have this was pure soy goodness.\n4.  clams - these were simply cooked in a clay pot.  they were a bit on the salty side, but i definitely enjoyed the seafood enfused essence of the clam broth.\n5.  unagi salted and unagi with light glaze of kabayaki sauce - raku has introduced me to the true form of unagi.  i think that i've been eating poor representations of unagi slathered in way too much kabayaki sauce, but this time i know i had the real thing!  the dish consisted of delicately grilled fresh water eel, one side lightly salted, one side lightly glazed in kabayaki sauce.  fantastic.\n6. charcoal grill items (mushroom skewers, <mark>Juicy Deep Fried Chicken</mark> skewers, pork cheek skewers, kobe beef skewers) - premium ingredients with smoky flavors and not an ounce of dryness or chewiness!\n7. <mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark> - this is our favorite at raku, and it did not disappoint.  it is their house made tofu deep fried and presented in their broth.\n8. raspberry sorbet - i'm usually not a fruity flavor dessert kind of gal unless it's fresh cut fruit, so i definitely did not enjoy this to the fullest.  the sorbet was more icy than smooth, but definitely had some intense raspberry flavor.\n\nconclusion:  raku chews up other japanese restaurants and spits them out kindly, politely and with flourish.  they win hands down.", 
            "do they make anything that isn't great. i've nearly tried everything on the menu and it's all been fantastic. my top 4 that i order each time i'm there - crispy asparagus, adegashi tofu, <mark>Juicy Deep Fried Chicken</mark>, soy-glazed foie gras. i always end with the foie because it's my favorite dish there and it never disappoints. the crispy asparagus makes you shake your head and question that your really eating asparagus because i guarantee that you've never tasted some with so much flavor. i really can't say anything bad about this place, it's a las vegas hidden treasure and a rarity to find such high quality off the strip.", 
            "this place definitely earns it's 4 1/2 stars. my meal was pretty much amazing. out of all the things we ordered there was only one thing that wasn't up to par and that is pretty much my fault ( i ordered the grilled rice ball in broth, i like the crunchiness of the grilled rice ball and i'm not huge on fish broth. so if you put two things i'm not fond of, the food is meh..)\n\n-ken 2 salad..had a nice mixture of veggies, chicken, salad dressing, and the <mark>Juicy Deep Fried Chicken</mark> skin mmm...\n-the tofu here is soo good.. fresh tofu with the green tea salt. omg\n-<mark>Juicy Deep Fried Chicken</mark> is just that, juicy deep fried goodness\n-kurobata pork cheek, tender and juicy\n-<mark>Crispy Fried Shrimp</mark> was tail and head on which wasn't what i expected, but i still ate it and enjoyed it thoroughly\n-kobe beef outside skirt steak with garlic yum! i had to order a second round\n-foie gras with glazed soy based sauce- my cousin said this was really good but super rich (as to be expected)\n-butter saut\\u00e9ed scallop with soy sauce-  omg..had to do a second round on this one too. it was amazingly tasty and cooked to perfection, like a medium rare..mmmm....\n-enoki mushroom wrapped with bacon- was enjoyed by my dining partners\n-oden with deep fried bean curd with mochi inside- really enjoyed by me... the mochi just oozed out of the yummy fried goodness\n-oden with pork intestine,beef tendon,chikuwa - fish sausage was gobbled down by my friend\n-yummy miso soup- had the delicious tofu\n\ndessert\nmelting chocolate cake- yum, flavors were good but i found the cake a bit dense for my tastes\ngreen tea cr\\u00e8me brul\\u00e9e-yummy... green tea\n\ndefinitely putting this restaurant in my normal rotation of places to go eat in vegas...i want to try the kaiseki dinner next time it looked so amazing every time they brought a dish out for another table",

            "4.5 stars\n\nraku is one of the off-strip las vegas restaurants i hear most about. raku's charcoal-grilled robata is one of the restaurant's specialties, but they also offer a variety of fresh fish and an assortment of cold and hot plates. before going in, i asked around for recommendations and the answers i got spanned the whole menu. clearly, the restaurant does a lot of things well.\n\nwe ordered a bunch of things in no particular order, but started with an amuse from the kitchen.\n\ntaiwanese spinach, enoki mushrooms, shitake mushrooms, bonito flakes - light and refreshing, this was a nice start to the meal.\n\nbluefin tuna sashimi - the restaurant has a chalkboard of daily specials, and this was one of them. oh my goodness...this was fantastic. exceptionally flavored and really tender, this was so good. easily better than much of the toro (and this wasn't toro) i've had in other restaurants; it briefly reminded me of urasawa.\n\n<mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark> - this homemade tofu was very good - soft and delicate with a subtle but present soy flavor. prepared agedashi style, the umami-rich broth was also very good.\n\n<mark>Crispy Fried Shrimp</mark> - the shrimp here were crispy as advertised and moist on the inside. nothing special really, but good. i'm never really sure if i'm supposed to eat these sort of things in its entirety, shell-on; but we did in this case.\n\n<mark>Crispy Asparagus Okaki</mark> - another crispy dish, i enjoyed the contrasting tenderness of the asparagus with the crispy rice cracker breading. there was a nuttiness to the breading, which i thought also went well with the vegetable.\n\n<mark>Juicy Deep Fried Chicken</mark> - this was a little bit unique as it seemed to be chicken that was rolled up, then fried and cut. juicy on the inside and crispy on the outside - no complaints here.\n\n<mark>Yellowtail Carpaccio</mark> - the fish was good here, but the bluefin spoiled me a bit as it didn't seem as special. still, the wasabi and yuzukosho did a nice job of brightening up the yellowtail in this dish.\n\nfish of the day - yellowback seabream - this was one of the fish of the day, served whole. it was a pretty small dish with only about 8 chunks of white flesh. it was very good though, with a crispy exterior from the deep frying.\n\n<mark>Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard</mark> - the custard was silky smooth with a fairly subtle foie gras flavor. very comforting. the piece of duck breast on top was pretty good too.\n\nwe proceeded with a number of robata-grilled dishes.\n\nbutter saut\\u00e9ed scallop with soy sauce - the scallop (served in its shell) was cooked well, but i thought the butter was a little overpowering here.\n\nchicken thigh - this was the first piece where i could really get a sense of the charcoal grill flavor. there was a smoky char on the chicken, and it was moist and flavorful. really simple and really good.\n\nkobe beef filet with wasabi - again, a good smoky flavor from the grill paired with some really flavorful tenderloin. surprisingly juicy and flavorful. i liked the fresh wasabi as well, countering the rich meat. delicious!\n\nkurobuta pork cheek - i was surprised to find this rather chewy, kind of like a chicken gizzard. maybe i just haven't really had cheek in this type of preparation. it was well-marbled, and the porky flavor was present.\n\nkobe beef tendon - not my favorite. i never really like the tendon though, and this was like a big blob of gooey tendon. so meltingly tender, i wasn't sure if i was biting into fat or tendon. i think this was probably a very good preparation, but it's not my thing.\n\nduck with balsamic soy sauce - an interesting dish here - the duck was prepared well, and the balsamic soy and fresh onions did a good job of cutting through some of the richness.\n\napple marinated lamb chop - tender and juicy, this was a damn good lamb chop. i'm not sure if i got any apple flavor though, but i didn't mind.\n\nkobe beef outside skirt with garlic - really good. exceedingly tender and flavorful, with a nice garlic touch.\n\ni had high expectations for raku and i wasn't disappointed. in fact, it exceeded them. after dining at places from joel robuchon and jose andres, it was nice to get something rather simple with clean, familiar flavors. almost like a detox, if you will. the raw fish preparations (ooh the bluefin!) and the robata-grilled items stood out most to me, but it was a well-rounded meal.", 
            "time for an update!  since my last review i've been to the sake tasting and had the kaiseki menu. \n\nfirst, the sake tasting.  this happened back in february.  $45 for ayce raku food plus all the sake and sapporo you can drink!  all the tables are reorganized for a cocktail-type service.  the food is freshly cooked and is served at the bar buffet style in the front of the restaurant.  small servings of tofu, various skewers of meat from the robata grill, asparagus wrapped in bacon, all the good stuff.  the staff just keeps cooking and bringing food out.  it was from 10pm to 2am, which is not the best time for me, but it was worth it!  not too crowded.  we made a reservation but they accepted walk-ins too.  people come and go as they please so that helps.  the sake servers are really knowledgeable.  i learned a lot.  i really, really hope they do this again but i have not seen another announcement for this since the last one in february.  such a good deal and so much fun, too!\n\nsecond, i had the 15-course kaiseki menu earlier this month.  this is not for the faint of heart or those who are in a hurry.  it's $150 per person and they need at least 3 days notice.  you need to make a reservation and they take your credit card number because they actually start preparing your meal 3 days in advance!  the website says it takes about 3 hours to complete.  ours took around 3.5 hours.  it was an awesome experience!  the menu changes each time but here are some of the highlights: homemade tofu served with roe, sashimi, <mark>Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard</mark>, a sampling of their appetizers including <mark>Juicy Deep Fried Chicken</mark> and crispy asparagus, steak and garlic cooked on a really hot stone, and fluffy cheesecake.  i've downloaded pics if you are interested.  definitely come hungry.  i didn't eat all day.  there is also a $100 10-course menu.\n\nthis is my favorite restaurant in all of las vegas.  once i get off my stupid diet, i'm going here.", 
            "i dined at raku at about 10pm on a tuesday night and really enjoyed my meal.  \n\nthe pitcher of beer came with chilled glasses so that's always a plus.\n\nthe aji sashimi on special was good but i really liked their in house made wasbi and soy sauce.  very yummy!\n\nnext came the fried ebi balls (also a special) and they were like deep fried har gau dumplings.  light and tasty.\n\nthen came the items we ordered from the robata grill - chicken wings, enoki mushrooms wrapped in bacon, and kurobota pork cheeks.  i'm a big robata fan so i loved all 3 of these choices.  the wing in particular was very meaty and so tender and flavorful.\n\nthe best dish of the night was probably the <mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark>.  i even drank up all of the broth it came in!\n\nthe <mark>Juicy Deep Fried Chicken</mark> was also a winning dish.\n\nbut i do have deduct 1 star for service.  one of the older ladies wasn't the friendliest and then they also forgot our grilled musubi order.  when we reminded them about it, it came out way too late.", 
            "i don't give five star reviews lightly. in fact, i kind of don't even want to write this review because more people will start going here and it will get even harder to get a reservation. but here we go:\n\nthis place is magic.\n\ni know what you're thinking: \"i don't believe in magic\" except you will after you visit raku. imagine homemade tofu that tastes like clouds and childhood, sitting in a warm broth and topped with wisps of dashi and irreverent bursts of roe with just the tiniest little swirl of sweet chili paste. i would happily eat their age dashi weekly if i could, perhaps even daily. the kurubata menu is filled with lots of little taste teasers -- i especially loved the butter poached scallops and the <mark>Juicy Deep Fried Chicken</mark>. similarly, raku's specials are amazing: our last visit, we were treated to flying fish two ways, as sashimi and also deep-fried in a broth. the fried preparation was fantastic, but the sashimi was paper thin and so fresh and delicate that it was almost like eating fruit slices rather than fish. i just might be ruined for other sashimi for life, always thinking about what could have been.\n\nthis is what i'm saying. magic.\n\nthe best part of raku is the price: a similar meal on the strip would be hundreds of dollars, but two people can eat extremely well at raku for under a hundred dollars, including drinks. \n\none caveat: make a reservation, as this is a tiny place, and it's very unlikely that you could walk in and get a table.", 
            "this japanese robata is consider to be on of the top restaurants in las vegas.  there are relatively few tables and a small counter with chairs so we secured advance reservations several days prior to our departure for las vegas.  we started off with bacon wrapped asparagus ($2.80, 3 forks) which was tasty, but too stringy, kobe beef skirt steak with garlic ($7.50, 4 forks) and cucumber with 3 types of seaweed salad ($5, 3 forks).  our next order included grilled rice balls which proved to a real yawner ($5, 2forks), <mark>Juicy Deep Fried Chicken</mark> ($9, 4.5 forks) and a very micro sized piece of yellowtail with soy sauce ($5, 3 forks). although the entire meal was good, nothing stood out as memorable and i felt the price points were too high.", 
            "so glad we trusted the reviews and came here! such a find!\n\na cute little place with lovely service. we ordered the fresh tofu (out of this world, a must order), the crispy <mark>Juicy Deep Fried Chicken</mark> (so good), sashimi, whole black snapper, pork intestine, pork ear (yum!), <mark>Poached Egg</mark> with sea urchin (this was really great). and the sake recommendation was delightful. \n\na fantastic experience!!", 
            "as a japanese-born foodie, i would highly recommend this restaurant. this was my first time going, and i would definitely go back again. \n\nservice is so-so, but i think we went at a fairly busy time, and reservations are highly recommended. plan on spending a fair amount of time, and don't be too concerned if the service is a little slow. i would rather spend time and enjoy the food anyway. \n\nhave the <mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark>, asparagus bacon, buttered scallops, beef tataki, enoki bacon, <mark>Juicy Deep Fried Chicken</mark> (boneless), even the miso soup was great too with nameko.",

            "wow. for my husband's birthday we enjoyed a self selected 21 item dinner for $130. it was amazing. first we started with a saki sampler - who knew saki came in more flavors that green apple?!? after the saki we very delicious items to include crispy <mark>Juicy Deep Fried Chicken</mark>, grilled duck breast, daikon, grilled tomato and asparagus, pork cheek, lamb chop... omg, the list goes on and ends with a great chocolate lava cake! awesome waiter, andrew, and friendly staff.", 
            "when you start off knowing that all the major players eat here, you know you're in for a meal of a lifetime. not only does raku serve beautifully executed food, it's a bargain at 10+ courses for only $50pp. the icing on the cake is knowing that you may run into joel robuchon, guy savoy, or even mario batali in his orange crocs. raku is the only place that has managed to \"wow\" me even more on the second visit as compared to the first. and that's not discounting the first meal because that was exquisite in and of itself. however on the second visit, raku was able to re-invent itself and offer even more delectables and a considerably different tasting menu that wowed my palate even more.\n\nthe restaurant is unassuming, located in a strip mall in chinatown. the decor is minimal with two bathrooms with serious personality. the service is unfussy but genuine and you can tell that they take great care in plating and execution without taking it too seriously. the flavors are clean and emphasis is on using only the best ingredients. all of the components of each dish are well thought out and serve a purpose. the results are nothing short of amazing.\n\nmy favorites are as follows:\n*<mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark> - homemade tofu melts in your mouth and the broth is heavenly, literally out of this world!\n*<mark>Juicy Deep Fried Chicken</mark> - amazingly <mark>Juicy Deep Fried Chicken</mark> wrapped in <mark>Juicy Deep Fried Chicken</mark> skin...need i say more...\n*<mark>Crispy Asparagus Okaki</mark> - the crispy fry on the outside of the asparagus adds the perfect crunch and toasted rice flavor to add incredible depth. add some green tea salt to bring out the flavors even more\n*dried tatmi <mark>Dried Tatami Sardine Salad</mark> - ceasar salad kicked up a notch, great briny and cheesy flavor\n*kurobuta pork cheek robata - juicy and great grill flavor from the robata\n*<mark>Fried Ice Fish</mark> - beautifully <mark>Fried Ice Fish</mark> served whole with fish nuggets in again, heavenly broth\n*enoki mushroom wrapped in bacon robata - it's wrapped with bacon...need i say more\n*<mark>Yellowtail Carpaccio</mark> - sashimi was incredibly fresh\n*grape tomatoes robata - so simple but simply delicious...add the green tea salt and you're going to be impressed and want to try to make it at home\n*salmon ikura don - beautifully presented and then served into individual portions. the ikura pops in your mouth to bring the taste of the ocean to the salmon rice.\n*udon noodle with <mark>Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard</mark> soup - the broth as well as the noodles were amazing\n*eel don with gobo - again, served with heavenly broth. the gobo added great depth by bringing a bit of earthy bitterness to balance the salty and sweet.\n*<mark>Crispy Fried Shrimp</mark> - fried little shrimpies, delicious.. \n*sorbet of the season - so simple, a strawberry sorbet with condensed milk. the combination makes the sorbet take on a creamy texture and the fruit flavor packs a good punch to end the meal. the kiwi one was delicious as well \n\n\nthe things i would forgo to save room for the things above:\nchicken thigh robata\nchicken breast wrapped with chicken skin robata\nkobe beef outside skirt with garlic robata\n<mark>Tofu Salad</mark> \"caprese\" with seaweed, tomatoes, and dried fishies", 
            "my wife and kids finally made it up to vegas and we had reservations for an early dinner at raku.  i've heard so many good things about this place so i had to see for myself.  overall we had a good meal an i'd love to come back again.  the <mark>Juicy Deep Fried Chicken</mark> was just that.......juicy.  it was sooo good.  and the skin was very crispy still yet.  <mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark> wad also excellent.  that dash/soy broth was amazing.  the butter sauteed scallop with soy was also amazing as well.  the kobe skirt with garlic was great as well with the perfect amount of garlicky goodness in each bite.  a few dishes didn't quite do it for us though.  the chicken breast wrapped with chicken skin....meh.  the kurobuta pork cheek wad tougher than i had imagined it shouldn't been.  and the grilled rice ball in broth ( we ordered it with salmon) had a touch too much shiso flavor for me.  overall, we enjoyed the meal and will let my parents know about this place for the next time they travel to vegas.", 
            "i heard great things of the sake tasting so decided to come at the lure of unlimited drink and eats for $45. \n\nthere was about 20 sakes to try as well as light/dark asahi. sake isn't a spirit i am well versed in but know enough to see some of these are quality items. i was impressed with some of the smoothness and flavor of some of these and makes me rethink about adding a daiginjo sake into our spirit collection. \n\nthe buffet ranged from-\n\nrobatas: filet w/ garlic, chicken thigh, pork belly, bacon enoki, mushroom, tomato.\noden: 3kinds of fishcake, soybean curd wrapped mochi, beef tendons, chicken meatballs, seaweed, noodles, potato, radish. \napps: asparagus wrapped in panko/nuts, tempura <mark>Fried Ice Fish</mark>, <mark>Juicy Deep Fried Chicken</mark>, roast beef, tofu with tomato, cold tofu, whole <mark>Crispy Fried Shrimp</mark>, chopped seafood with/pickled bonito guts, sashimi w/ ponzu, baby radish to dip in fermented bean paste or mustard.\ndessert: brown sugar custard/jelly in condense milk with a dried goji berry.\n\ni probably missed a few things, but these were recurring items. i can see the quality of the food here definitely. the oden beef tendons are some of the best i've had. the robatas definitely get the special flavor of the binchotan charcoal imparted on them. the tofu has superb texture. \n\nnow the rub of this event- it was disneyland status wait. we waited to pay. we waited for food. no food was up there a few times we went so it was another wait for anything to come out. we waited to get to seat in one of the limited seating areas. the layout makes for intimate dining but is not very good for banquet style as many of the aisles are narrow and tables/areas aren't made for maximum utility. you can come later, but a lot of the food has been already attacked and i don't know how freshly made a ton of it will be. since it's usually pretty pricey to eat here, i probably did get my moneys worth even though i wouldn't say i was neither too drunk or too full by the time we decided to go already. \n\nthe food was good, but i don't know if i was floored by it enough to justify regular pricing. it's probably significantly better when it's not made in larger plates, but some i got straight from the kitchen piping hot. i also think i'm forever disappointed by my izakaya style meals here on out as none can top an epic night at shunju in roppongi for me. \n\nthere are some more gourmet items i'm still dying to try, so i will be back for a regular dining experience to try the more unique offerings and skip the basics this buffet has served.", 
            "my wife and i began our 10 year anniversary weekend with visit to raku as we drove into vegas at 1:45 am on friday night (saturday morning, actually).  fortunately for us, the kitchen was making its last call and we still had time to order.\n\nbest dishes:\n<mark>Poached Egg</mark> with sea urchin (salmon roe, jalapeno, mushrooms, mountain root in soba broth served cold) - amazing well constructed with a perfectly <mark>Poached Egg</mark> and various layers of flavor that all worked together.  a bargain at $9.\nfoie gras chawanmushi (<mark>Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard</mark> with a hint of foie gras, smoked duck and black truffle) - creamy, rich, delicious!  $10\n<mark>Juicy Deep Fried Chicken</mark> (six medallions of chicken, fried, over a bed of baby spinach) - we weren't going to order this, but our waitress highly recommended it, and we're glad she did. $9\nenoki mushroom with bacon - great flavor from the grill and a thick, lean, juicy cut of bacon. $2.80 for two.\nkamo grilled duck (with balsamic soy sauce) - tender, well seasoned, and not gamey at all.\n\ngood dishes:  <mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark>, momo chicken thigh, grilled veal\n\ndisappointing:  kobe beef with wasabi (surprisingly ordinary), tontoro kurobuta pork cheek (too fatty for our taste), <mark>Sashimi Salad</mark> (expected more from raku)\n\nregarding some topics raised by other reviewers:\nprice.  we thought the prices were quite reasonable for a restaurant of this quality.\nservice.  for the most part, the wait staff was pleasant and informative.  they were not very attentive - we did have to ask for refills, etc.  but, because the restaurant was small and not crowded, it was fairly easy to get their attention.\n\noverall, this was a great meal and a fantastic way to start our 10th anniversary weekend.", 
            "as with everyone else's review please make reservations.  we walked in with no reservation and luckily got into a 1 hour window for a table.  arrived at 6pm.  we mainly came here for a the raku fresh tofu.  service is a slow so don't expect to leave quickly unless they are trying to get you out before the next party arrives.  \n  the condiments are all homemade and must be tried with the tofu.  \n\nordered\nraku tofu (fantastic one of the best i've had)\n<mark>Juicy Deep Fried Chicken</mark> (crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside)\nenoki mushroom wrapped with bacon (tasty )\njapanese shishito pepper (gives a nice kick)\niberco ham skewer (tastes like bacon and oh so good)\n\nthe food here is great with plenty of flavors to give you a wild experience.  so if you've got the time to pull yourself away from the strip for a bit then come on down.\n\nwould i go back? you bet your pastrami i would!",

            "i am fully aware of how yelpers in general have an unconditional and unwavering love for this place, just like i'm very aware of the \"yelpers love us\" sticker on the door. the reviews were one of the reasons we decided to come to this place, however, its also one of the few times that i have disagreed with the raving reviews of yelp.\n\nwe came here about 1 am on a wednesday morning and even though there were open seats, they still felt that we should wait before being seated. 10 minutes later, we were seated at one of the open seats.\n\nfrom the onset, the service was a bit slow. our server asked if we were ready to order right away, but we asked for a minute. it was only after about 15 minutes of waiting we decided to flag our server to order. the food also came slowly but that wasn't really the issue.\n\nso down to the food. we ordered:\n\n1) aohata nabe: this was basically a fish stew. this was 40 dollars and my least favorite item that we ordered. it wasn't bad, but it wasn't particularly good either.\n\n2) <mark>Tofu Salad</mark>: this simple item was probably one of my favorites. it's 7 dollars and pretty flavorful with their green tea salt.\n\n3) <mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark>: i know that this item is all that yelpers rave about, and it was good, but cooome on... its not that good! 10 dollars. actually, i thought it was just \"ok.\"\n\n4) <mark>Crispy Asparagus Okaki</mark>. this was actually really good. it tasted like asparagus with japanese cracker crumbs. 5 dollars.\n\n5) <mark>Juicy Deep Fried Chicken</mark>: simple <mark>Juicy Deep Fried Chicken</mark> served much like a sushi roll. these tasted great. 9 dollars.\n\n6) tsukune: the ground chicken was my 2nd least favorite. just very ehh. $3.50.\n\n7) enoki mushroom w/ bacon: this was probably my favorite item of the night, simple yet very tasty. $2.80.\n\n8) scallop w/ soy sauce: the scallop was amazing, especially with the sauce that it comes in. loved this. 7 dollars.\n\nwe tried to order the pork belly but they were out.\n\nall in all, perhaps because of the raving reviews, this place was a slight disappointment. from the slow service to the aohata nabe, things were just a bit off with the whole experience. \n\nthe food, in general, is good, but its not that good. this experience reminds the moment when walking out of the movie theaters after watching hunger games. overrated. i'm saying this as a person that loves japanese food (and i'm not talking about california rolls as japanese food), but real authentic japanese food.\n\nif you're in the mood for tasty no-frills chinese/malaysian food at about 1/6 of the price, go to big wong, only a few feet away from raku.", 
            "i've been reading all the wonderful reviews and great press that raku has gotten and have been dreaming of visiting for about 3 years. finally, for my birthday this year, i got my husband to take me.\nwe made reservations, and it's a good thing we did because the restaurant is tiny - like maybe 20 diners can sit down at tables and 4 more at the bar, tiny. we got an early table (hey, we have a little baby at home!) and we saw two groups come and leave because they couldn't get a table.\nfirst, the drinks: an excellent selection of sake with a very informative menu, and a handful of bottled japanese beers (and not just asahi, either!). we both had new beers and they were both good; prices were average ($7-8).\nfor our meal, we started with the oft-reviewed hot and cold tofus. i thought the cold was really delicious, and the green tea salt and house soy sauce really made the dish pop. the hot was just meh. we didn't finish it. my husband is a miso soup lover, so he got a bowl of it and it was good, but just miso soup. it was packed with tofu, so after that, we were feeling kinda tofu-ed out. next up were the specials (a blue-fin tuna and a yellowtail dish). they were both really good and the dishes completely came together with all the accompaniments. i always like blue-fin tuna and yellowtail, but these dishes were a cut above. almost up to nobu status, i think. \nthen we branched out with something kind of adventurous - uni with <mark>Poached Egg</mark> and salmon roe. wow, it was so mushy and runny, i had to force down the second bite - ew (but that's just me). finally, we got the <mark>Juicy Deep Fried Chicken</mark> (good, but not the best <mark>Juicy Deep Fried Chicken</mark> i've had by a long shot) and the skewers of duck (thumbs up for that one). \nthe final bill came out to about $135 with tip.\nmy overall thought is that it's good and i'm really glad i went to experience it once, but i'll probably never go back since i didn't love all the food and it's expensive. \nalso, i'm not sure, but i may not be cut out to eat the food they actually eat in japan.", 
            "when the lights go out on the strip, where do the chefs and restaurant staff go to eat?\n\nraku! \n\nwell what can i say? obviously, people working in the restaurant industry have very good and discerning taste. \n\nif you come to raku expecting to eat maki rolls, you will be disappointed. japanese cuisine is so much more beyond maki rolls. no, japanese don't eat sushi everyday.\n\nraku has many items as part of the daily special that are written on a portable blackboard. our server brought the board to our table and went through each of them. we ended up ordering many items from the specials because they were too good to pass up on.\n\nhighlights from the specials:\n\n*seigo (japanese sea bass)*\nchoose 2 out of 3 methods of preparation: sashimi, grilled, fried.\nthe order is for a whole fish. based on our chosen method of sashimi and grilled, half of it was delicately sliced into sashimi. the other half was grilled to perfection (head and tail included)\n\n*bai gai (japanese sea snail)*\nsuch beautiful snail shells! our server told us that the snails are first cooked for 7-8 hrs until tender and then they are steamed to order.\n\n*kushi (kobe beef tongue)*\nsmall pieces came on a yakitori stick. drizzled with intensely flavorful sauce.\n\n*kakuni (pork belly)*\nbraised until very tender. we ate up both meat and fat without guilt.\n\nitems we ordered from the regular menu which were equally amazing:\n\n*raku tofu*\nthis is their signature housemade tofu. our server told us that raku makes their tofu fresh everyday. the tofu was unlike any other we've had. the texture was extremely creamy. it is meant to be sprinkled with some green tea salt made with mushroom <mark>Sunomono - Cucumber And Seaweed</mark>. and then enjoyed with soy sauce, scallions, and bonito flakes.\n\n*<mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark>*\nalso uses the housemade tofu, slightly fried on the outside, and served with dashi sauce, roe, tiny mushrooms, and japanese chilli paste on the side.\n\n*<mark>Juicy Deep Fried Chicken</mark>*\nthis is similar to karaage (<mark>Juicy Deep Fried Chicken</mark> cutlets). the chicken was unbelievably moist and it was fried until it just crossed over from rare to cooked. i don't know how the chefs timed it that well, but it sure prevented an overcooked and dry meat.\n\n*oden (fish cakes)*\nwe selected several types of fish cakes that were served in dashi broth. other items we chose were daikon and pork intestines. oden is especially popular in winter in japan.\n\nif you're visiting vegas and have no access to a car like us, we hopped into a cab from our hotel and raku is just a short ride away. we called for a cab after we were done with dinner. no hassle. make reservations!",

            "i'm not a huge fan of yakitori but i would have to say that this is probably the best place that i've ever had for yakitori.  if you love yakitori, you should definitely try this place out if you're in vegas.  \n\nreservations are really hard to get and i'm not sure why they are so strict on their reservations.  we had our reservation for 11:30pm on a wednesday night (before 4th of july) and we called to try to move it up earlier but the earliest they would give us was 11pm.  we got there around 11pm and the place was empty.  pretty much only 25% filled.  it's not a huge place by any means so it was weird that it was so empty when all i kept hearing about was the long wait.  it did get packed toward the end of the night around 12:30am-1am when we left.  \n\nwe sat down and ordered the following (must orders are ranked first):  \n\n<mark>Juicy Deep Fried Chicken</mark> - this is a must order.  if you go here and you don't want to order anything else that i listed, you have to at least try this dish.  it's amazing!!!!  we ordered two of these to split between four people.  it comes with 6 pieces but it's so good that you will be wanting more.  i'm salivating just thinking about it.    \n\nfoie gras with glazed soy based sauce - must order if you like foie gras.  i don't like foie gras and therefore, i don't eat it but my husband loved it.  it comes in a small size but it's perfect for two to share.  \n\nkobe beef tendon - this is another must order.  i don't even like tendon but we ordered this to try and it was melt in your mouth yummy goodness.  it's definitely a must try even if you don't like tendon.  \n\niberico pork - another must order.  it's iberico pork, need i say anything more?  \n\nchicken thigh - similar to other places but still moist and juicy and still really good for yakitori.  \n\nagadashi tofu - this dish is very similar to what you can get at other places, this was probably the better tofu of the two tofu dishes that are offered.  we all agreed that this was the better tofu of the two but it's tofu.  so nothing that unique about it.  \n\nasparagus with bacon - similar to other places, it's asparagus and bacon.  you can't really do much else with that combo.  \n\nraku's tofu - this tofu was really bland and you're supposed to eat it with the seasonings that are provided to you at your table.  if anything, there wasn't really anything unique about this tofu.  i would order the agadashi tofu over this one.  \n\ndirect flamed eggplant - this was unique and different but it was pretty bland.  i would have to say it was the worst dish of the night.  you can put some flavorings and seasonings on it to make it taste better but it was just plain.  \n\nthe portion sizes are small so if you have four people, it's good to get 2 skewers of each item to share.  plus, this place is pretty pricey as well so be prepared to drop some serious cash but for some good food.   definitely on my list of places to go when in vegas!", 
            "it's taken me a long time to getting around to this review, but i needed to dedicate time to properly raving about this wonderful meal. i visited on 04/11/2013 with my fiance ruben and our cousin daisy (visiting from the bay area). we were sat in a private dining area and it was so cool and intimate. i was really glad i made that reservation a couple months in advance!\n\nwe tried the raku's tofu: housemade tofu that was super silky served with fresh grated ginger, green onions, and katsuoboshi. then topped with some of raku's soy sauce (japanese daijingo soy sauce blended with japanese plum). simple and tasty. also, the <mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark>: their housemade tofu lightly fried and presented in a bowl of warm dashi broth and topped with green onions, ikura, and nori. and for an extra kick, some hot chili paste placed on the rim of your bowl. really, really great. i'm a big fan of tofu so i could be happy eating raku's tofu all night, but this <mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark> is a party of flavors in your mouth.\n\nwe also tried the tempura asparagus, kanpachi sashimi (special), blue fin tuna sashimi (special), salmon with ikura oroshi, enoki mushroom wrapped in bacon, direct-flamed eggplant (served with katsuoboshi), duck with balsamic soy sauce, kobe beef filet with wasabi, apple marinated lamb chop, grilled rice balls, yellowtail with glazed soy-based sauce, and <mark>Juicy Deep Fried Chicken</mark>. their yuzu sake is really delicious.\n\nmy favorites were the tofu dishes, the sashimi specials, enoki mushroom with bacon (this was so good, we ordered it twice), and apple marinated lamp chop (we ordered two of these as well).\n\nour meal was spectacular. we had so much fun with all the dishes and the service was wonderful. there are so many selections and everything was, at the least exciting, and at the best, amazing. i would compare the experience to enjoying tapas with great friends. same idea with sharing small plates and that's just always a blast in my book. the food was wonderful, i seriously can't wait to go back and try some of their other amazing concoctions!", 
            "amazing restaurant and a must eat at place when in las vegas - make sure you make a reservation. possibly the best japanese restaurant i have ever been to. we order from their vast menu of izakaya style dishes and every dish is usually delicious. if you go, you must try their homemade tofu and <mark>Juicy Deep Fried Chicken</mark>. be prepared for a long dinner though - it's not somewhere to go if you are in a rush.", 
            "raku is one of my favorite restaurants for a number of reasons.  great things happen when i eat here and the food is excellent. to celebrate a special occasion, i went here. we were considering getting the omakase for $100/person but that's like a lottery - you don't know what items you'll get. although i've never had anything i didn't like from this place, we had specific things we wanted to try. \n\nmy faves:\nkobe beef filet with wasabi, kobe beef outside skirt with garlic, duck with balsamic soy sauce, foie gras with glazed soy-base sauce, asparagus with bacon, enoki mushroom wrapped with bacon and green tea creme brulee. i love their blue fin sashimi but we didn't order that this time.\n\naside from my faves, we also tried raku's homemade tofu, juicy deep-<mark>Juicy Deep Fried Chicken</mark>, <mark>Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard</mark>, chicken breast wrapped with chicken skin, kobe beef silver skin, iberico pork and kanpachi kama.\n\nhomemade tofu:\ncan be ordered in half or full portions. comes with ginger, green onions and bonito. the texture of the tofu is so different from all the tofu i've ever had. it has the consistency of formed cottage cheese. 4.5/5\n\njuicy deep-<mark>Juicy Deep Fried Chicken</mark>:\ncrispy skin, juicy fatty chicken. absolutely delicious! 5/5\n\n<mark>Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard</mark>:\nthis dish has the same broth as in <mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark>. this chawanmushi has a mild foie gras taste to it and has a piece of duck on top. 5/5\n\nchicken breast wrapped with chicken skin:\nslightly crisp chicken skin seasoned with salt. for some reason, i really liked the simplicity of this dish. 5/5\n\nkobe beef silver skin:\na bit oily and sweet. this is the skin of a cow put on a skewer and grilled. 4/5\n\niberico pork:\ni love jamon iberico and i was thinking this would be similar. but this is actual chunks of pork with a yummy sauce and grilled. 5/5\n\nkanpachi kama:\nperfectly grilled amberjack collar with a nice ponzu/soy dipping sauce. although i was not in the mood for fish, i still think this is the best kama in town. very meaty, moist (terrible word) and perfectly cooked. 5/5\n\nalthough the last time we went here, they didn't have 2 items we wanted: <mark>Poached Egg</mark> w/ sea urchin and salmon roe and, hamachi kama. they also changed their decor. they replaced hello kitty with a pig with a big mouth - creepy looking mofo! i'd still come back here regardless...", 
            "i've been here at least 8 times.  they never failed in making the meals memorable.  keep in mind the plates are vary small, one bite per person.  so be prepared to order a lot.  i love the <mark>Juicy Deep Fried Chicken</mark>, <mark>Fried Ice Fish</mark>, blue fin tuna sashimi , tofu adegashi, mushroom w bacon, scallop in butter sauce, lamb rack, skirt steak.\nif your party has more than 4 people, they will put you in the room in the back and make the omakase meal for $65/pp.  with such exquisite flavor and taste, i think it's worth every penny.\ni always take friends and family there every time they come into town.", 
            "i went to raku for the first time as a treat to some out-of-town friends. i had heard good things about the restaurant, and was curious to try it.\nthe restaurant is small inside, with beautiful japanese decorations. the table we sat at had glass in the center, with tea ceremony pieces within. very pretty! \nthe best food items were the house made tofu with green tea salt (yummy), the <mark>Juicy Deep Fried Chicken</mark> appetizer, and the most delicious green tea creme brulee! \nthere are a variety of sake and liquors to order, as well as house made ice tea which is very good. would definately recommend this to all japanese food lovers, can not wait to come again!", 
            "small tiny place that you have to make reservations for way in advance. my mom made a reservation for us 2 weeks in advance, and if you're late..within 15 minutes they will give your table to somebody else. \n\nlocated in a small tiny corner in chinatown. we got there about 10 minutes before our reservation time, but we were assisted to sit down right away. the food itself takes quite a long time to arrive. we were there for almost 2 hours. it took about a good 45 minutes for the first plate to come out. \n\ni actually prefer shin sen gumi yakitori over this place. the taste isn't as strong as theirs. but, overall it's pretty good. \n\npopeye salad $8- spinach and bacon (mainly), decently good. a little too salty, but a good salad nonetheless!\n\n<mark>Crispy Asparagus Okaki</mark> $5- delicious. super crunchy, and it actually tasty cheesy! nom nom. \n\n<mark>Juicy Deep Fried Chicken</mark> $9- not a favorite. didn't have too much flavor to it, and it was strangely chewy. slightly warm as well. \n\n<mark>Fried Ice Fish</mark> $8.50- frowning as i write this. i don't like fish, and i don't like seeing multiple tiny fishes fried up whole. i ate like 3.. d: no gusta.\n\n<mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark> $11- pretty good! i just didn't like the fish eggs inside, but overall it was a good and flavored dish!\n\nmomo chicken thigh $2.75 each- err, it was a little too pink for my liking, and it was kind of fatty. it was okay \n\ntsukune $3.50 each- shin sen's is much tastier. this one comes as like a drumstick, and i had to keep adding more togarashi. not enough sauce. \n\nharami kobe beef skirt $7.50 each- delicious! comes with grunchy garlic chips. mmm, super tasty!\n\nyakionigiri $5.00 (comes with 2)- it was..okay. lol\n\nscallop with soy sauce $7.00- not sure how this tasted. didn't eat this one!\n\nasparagus with bacon $3.00- comes with 3 pieces, pretty good. \n\nasahi $7.00\n\numeshu $12.00 (super delicious!)\n\noverall, the flavor was almost there, and i didn't think it was the greatest.", 
            "absolutely fabulous! le cirque, this is how it's done. fabulous service, pride in what they serve, well seasoned food, could not fault it. \nwe tried both the house tofu which was, as someone else described it... like a delicate soft ricotta cheese... but this was better than that... unlike any other tofu i have tried, and the accompaniments really favored the tofu, second on the list was the <mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark>, in a well seasoned broth, delicious. \nan outstanding seared foie gras in a soy based glazed sauce, and although there was evidence of a very small vein, it was so deliciously done, well seared and seasoned, i can certainly overlook it. the kobe beef with garlic was tender and so flavorful, the chicken thigh simple but yummy. also tried the refreshing vinegary cucumber & seaweed with a lighter than expected vinegary taste, and lastly we tried the <mark>Juicy Deep Fried Chicken</mark>, which was delicious, but a bit too pink in the middle for my liking and safety. \nwe missed going to sweets raku afterwards, due that we had $50 worth of jean phillip pastries to go back to", 
            "in town for a bachelor party and the bachelor and his brother are both chefs so i knew when they set up a reservation at this place that it was upon good research and recommendation. \n\nwe received 7 courses in total, each better than the last. as we waited for dinner to begin we enjoyed sake as well as the ambience. the bathrooms in raku where really breathtaking. unfortunately just before dinner they were both occupied and my friend was forced to quietly vomit in a private corner.  very accommodating, indeed. \n\nfirst up was a tofu dish. i don't typically enjoy tofu but this was different. it was a soft tofu that was perfectly seasoned, and the condiments were perfectly paired. in fact, perfect condiments were the theme of dinner. such a seemingly small detail but when done right it goes a long way! all at the table enjoyed the tofu with the exception of my friend who had been busy eradicating his upper gi tract of any free radicals since we sat down. he excused himself to the bathroom to seek solitude in the cool grass floor covering and  the warm heated toilet. \n\nnext out was the fish. i'm not well versed in fish so i won't attempt to rehash all the sashimi that we enjoyed but it was all well cut, presented, and of course delicious. once again the condiments were perfect. the pickled ginger was a fresh take on ginger for me.  at this point the sake was really flowing and our friend returned. i fed him a piece of tuna and he found it so tasty his body immediately began telling him he should make room for more, so after ordering him a ginger ale we excused him to step outside and take some air.\n\nthe lamb chops- my goodness. i don't think i've ever had them so succulent before! fortunately for us our friend was still enjoying the night air, so we had one to spare. as we speculated wether or not our friend would quietly disappear into a taxi cab outside we divided his chop and all the meat quickly disappeared. against all odds our friend returned and next up was the whole fried flying fish. \n\nthe meat of the flying fish was wonderful, but i was feeling bold and went after the fish skeleton. whole <mark>Fried Ice Fish</mark> skeleton is delightfully crunchy and the cheek of the head is arguably the best part of the fish. we quickly layer waste to two entire fish and when the frenzy was over only the fins remained. i hope i have a chance to enjoy flying fish again'\n\nnext came the beef. when our friend saw the kobe beef yakatori with wasabi on top he was so excited he couldn't stop himself from evacuating his stomach right there at the table. we'd later take advantage of an extra foie gras courtesy of our friend. it turns out that when you're slouched over in your chair with your forehead against the cool wallpapered wall of a restaurant and slyly booting on the floor next to your chair, it makes you think about life, it makes you feel generous and you share more food with your friends. \n\nas dinner wound down and we finished all the sake, our friend finally turned the corner and was able to eat some <mark>Juicy Deep Fried Chicken</mark>. we enjoyed the company of our waitress and the family atmosphere. we enjoyed a few more dishes but i'll leave the reader to explore the menu on their own. you really must go to raku!  food was a+, restaurant was beautiful, and the staff was private and polite! cheers!", 
            "i could sum up the review for this place in one word: no. or in three words: no, no, no. \n\ni'm told that ordering a meal a la carte is actually quite decent. judging by our actual omakase experience, however, i'm incredibly skeptical. for starters, most of us were still hungry after our meal, even after filling up all day on beers, cupcakes, hotdogs, candy, sake, hawaiian bbq, korean bbq, you name it. additionally, the only dish that brought out any sort of excited response from our group of eight was this plain <mark>Juicy Deep Fried Chicken</mark> dish -- and even that quickly turned into a discussion of real <mark>Juicy Deep Fried Chicken</mark>: kfc vs. popeyes. everything else was immediately forgettable. i was still wondering when \"the good part\" of meal was actually starting when they announced that the final dish was being brought out. easily the worst omakase experience i've ever had anywhere. i'd sooner go to mcdonald's and order a burger-flipping-high-school-kid's choice tasting menu. \n\nbut even with average food in small quantities, we could have had a decent meal and left. nope. we were forced to wait an ungodly amount of time between each dish being presented. i'm talking ten minutes as an absolute minimum between the time our plates were cleared and the time a new dish was brought out. and since each \"dish\" is really just a tiny booger on a plate, that meant a lot of hangry people. to make the wait even more unbearable, there was horrible jazz music playing at barely-audible volume. this made us all incredibly sleepy and disinterested in conversation or food. it all just felt incredibly forced, like we were supposed to believe our meal was way more epic than it actually was due to the sheer amount of time spent in the establishment. really doesn't work.\n\nnot sure what people mean about the absolutely necessary reservations. we showed up at 7pm on saturday night and left after 9pm. i would think that should be the prime dinner period. less than half the restaurant was occupied the entire time.", 
            "this tapas styled restaurant has some exquisite reviews and we can understand why.\n\nfirst of all, the place is on the pricier side.  don't be fooled by the modest prices listed on the menu because the portions are tiny and the price is per individual item.  for example, the delicious kobe filet kabob with wasabi is 12 bucks for 1 skewer!  unless you want to share one small skewer with your date, you will need to purchase at least 2.  \n\nsecondly, it would be a smart idea to obtain a reservation because you will have to wait a long time if you attempt to walk in.  we walked in the minute they opened at 6pm in order to secure a spot.  we were seated next to the hostess and you won't believe the douchebags who try to weasel their way into getting a table without a reservation...i think i've heard all excuses/tricks in the book.  everything from the typical \"hows it going bro\" approach to someone claiming that they have a reservation the following day and wanted to check the place out today.  that guy was caught in his own web of lies, trying to spit out an answer when the host asked him what the name and time was on the reservation haha.\n\nthe food is definitely phenomenal, made with care.  everything we ordered was solid.\n\n- kobe fillet skewers with wasabi.  tender beef skewer with a thin line of wasabi, giving it just enough kick.  great hint of charcoal flavor.\n\n- enoki mushrooms wrapped in bacon.  love this one.  i love the fact that the bacon didn't fall apart.  expertly prepared.\n\n- cherry tomato wrapped in bacon.  anything wrapped in bacon tastes great\n\n- lamb chop.  the sauce was phenomenal...sweet, yet a hint of the japanese charcoal grill flavor.\n\n- <mark>Juicy Deep Fried Chicken</mark>.  the presentation is pretty solid.  chicken breast meat prepared to look like a sushi roll.  skin on chicken tastes great.\n\n- fluffy cheesecakes.  this was definitely our favorite dessert.  they must have some kind of magical mixer that can blend the ingredients so it tastes fluffy, yet dense enough to remind me of the cheesecake consistency\n\n- green tea creme brule.  this is pretty solid as well.  not too sweet.\n\neven though we gave this place 4 stars, i don't think we will be back unless we have some out of town friends who love unique japanese cuisine.  its a little pricey and there's too many places that provide similar foodie satisfaction at half the price in vegas.", 
            "oh las vegas izakaya places close at 3am. that's so awesome, since i didn't have time to eat until 11:30pm. this is a solid 4.5.\n\ni didn't even notice this place when i went to monta ramen next time. but how awesome to have two yummy shops in the same small outdoor plaza. \n\ni bookedmarked this place a few months ago and was looking for a snack at 11:30pm. good thing this place opens so late. no wait for bar seating on late  thursday night. reviewed the menu and chose a few snacks.\n\nchicken thigh $2.75 for 1 skewer [5 of 5] - delicious and <mark>Juicy Deep Fried Chicken</mark> meat. very tender and had this nice charcoal smell. it was perfectly roasted. \nkurobuta pork cheek $4.25 for 1 skewer [5 of 5] - delicious and juicy pork meat. the slice of roast meat was sensational.\nkobe beef tendon $3.50 for 1 skewer [4 of 5] - first time having roast tendon and it was delicious. the charrrrr taste and gooey tendon was wonderful. it is a little different from the typical meats, but worth trying. i really enjoyed it, but i also enjoy tendon.\nudon noodle with <mark>Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard</mark> soup $18 [4 of 5] - interesting concept. fusing the foie gras into a custard. then pouring light soy sauce into the custard to serve as the cold udon dipping sauce. i liked the idea, but the custard didn't physically work well as a dipping sauce. i think the pieces separately work better - <mark>Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard</mark> and a simple cold udon with a light and sweet dipping soy sauce. as a side note, the place used skinny udon noodle, which was very clever for dipping. \ngreen tea cr\\u00e8me brul\\u00e9e $6 [4 of 5] - presented with creme brulee and ice cream. it was matcha heaven. very enjoyable and rather delightful size for $6. \n\nthis place was cute. i wish i was more hungry so i could try more items from the menu. also, after i visited the restuarant, i saw a small clip of raku on anthony bourdain's parts unknown - las vegas. that was pretty cool. will be going back to try other dishes and skewers.", 
            "i came across raku from andrew zimmern. i was watching a random youtube video about las vegas eats, and mr. zimmern swears raku as an anti-vegas destination with some of the best japanese food around. i immediately dropped everything and headed off the strip. raku, located in a dismal looking strip mall in las vegas' very own chinatown, concentrates on good quality japanese cuisine. more of a japanese \"tapas\" bar, most of their items are shared amongst the table. most people associate japanese cuisine with sushi. chef and owner, mitsuo endo showcases a menu with japanese cuisine as an all-inclusive whole. there is no sushi on the menu, though there is raw fish and sashimi. everything is masterfully prepared and they use only the best ingredients.\n\nwe started things off with the uni soup. this was a simple dish that was so refreshing. the broth was soy sauce based and had a subtle seafood essence. filled with seaweed and a few slivers of uni, it was an interesting soup. the uni was flavorful and mellow -- the warm soup made it more toned down and silky. i don't it that is a good thing, but it was delicious. this was a great start to an awesome late night eat.\n\nwe ordered the pork belly to feed the carnivore within. it wasn't necessarily special. the quality and bite of the pork belly was a lot better though. most places will just put some thinly sliced pork belly on a stick, grill it and call it day. raku's was thicker, and more meaty. all in all, it was a deliciously cooked yakitori -- no sauce needed.\n\nsome of the best things i have ever eaten was raku's <mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark>. it is probably the best tofu i ever had. some sad days, i would be home alone. i'd open up a tub of tofu, microwave it, make some kind of soy sauce concoction, and pour it over the tofu. for what it was, it was tasty and i was happy. this <mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark> really changed my life. the tofu is made daily, in house. the fried exterior had a little crispiness with a hint of chewiness. inside, it was completely different -- smooth and silky, and custard like. the broth in itself makes this dish so good. i don't know what was in it, but soy sauce, rice wine vinegar and dashi was definitely in the mix. there was a smudge of red pepper puree on the bowl for a bit of spice. topped with ikira (salmon roe), scallions, and nori, the tofu dish was complex, yet perfectly balanced.\n\nwe ended things with one of my favorite chicken dishes of all time. the <mark>Juicy Deep Fried Chicken</mark>, as they call it, was exactly what the name suggests -- it was juicy. it was deep fried, and it's...chicken. the thigh meat is rolled up skin on, battered, and then fried. the roll is cut up into slices and then served on some vinaigrette dressed spinach. the vinaigrette on the spinach helped with the fatty chicken. as the picture shows, the chicken is a bit pink in the center -- might be a little alarming for sensitive types. for me though, the chicken was so juicy and flavorful -- probably achieved from this near \"medium well\" cooking. it was an exceptional dish in both flavor and texture.\n\nif you want to eat at raku, make reservations. i was given the stink eye when i walked in and said i didn't have reservations. luckily, i was seated within 10 minutes as long as we ate \"quickly.\" most likely, that won't happen to you unless you make a reservation for this small 48 seater restaurant. i was very impressed with the food at raku. the ingredients are of the highest quality and simply prepared. even the water is treated with respect, filtered with a giant charcoal log. details like this, with a passion for perfection makes raku very special. it's not just some japanese restaurant off the strip. it's possibly one of the best in the country.",

            "raku is my absolute favorite izakaya. i have been coming here for few years. it's time to write a review. \n\nservice: depending upon the server, some servers are bit snobby which i did not care for at all. sometimes i get lucky and get the better service. also, i don't like the fact that they give you time limit. this is not ayce!!!i understand they are very busy and need their tables  turnover but i just not a fan. i went few days ago, i think the server told us it's time for our last call after 1.5 hours or earlier. those are the reasons i didn't give 5 stars. \n\nfood: i love their food. five star on their food. here are some of my favorite:\n\n1. uni with mounta<mark>Veggie Pork Intestine In Pot</mark>, <mark>Poached Egg</mark> and salmon roe. i love love love this dish. for some reason, the combination of those items together along with the sauce in there makes this dish so heavenly. \n\n2. raku homemade tofu: if you like tofu, then you would love their homemade tofu. i like to eat it with their green tea sea salt along with all the condiments that comes with it. \n\n3. hamachi kama: they have the best hamachi kama in town. they are like 3 times bigger than the regular hamachi kama you order in other places but also 3 times the price. it's around 45 dollars. i think it's worth it, if you have party of three at least. otherwise it might be too big for two people. \n\n4. pork cheek yakitori: i normally don't like pork but their pork cheeks are so juicy and yummy! \n\n5, <mark>Juicy Deep Fried Chicken</mark>: one of my favorite <mark>Juicy Deep Fried Chicken</mark>. they rolled up the chicken thigh and fried it. yum yum yum! \n\n6. kobe beef outside skirt with garlic/ kobe beef fillet fresh wasabi: i like both of these. they are both very tender and juicy. \n\nthese are my must ordered items every time. as far as for their sashimi, i think they are pretty good for the most part. i had the not so fresh sashimi before though. \n\neven though it's hard to get reservation and with the snobby service, i will continue to come and try other items because i love their food so much", 
            "i had bookmarked raku for awhile now and i was ecstatic when i finally had the chance to come here.  get a reservation!! and do not come here if you are really really hungry.  that's my warning to all the guys out there.  my friend and i arrived at 630pm.  raku opens at 6pm.  okay, all the tables are full.  hostess estimates the wait is 30-45 minutes.  we did not get seated until 8pm!  total torture because the mall had a top rated ramen shop and a famous chinese restaurant.\n\neach dish takes around 5 minutes to come out and it comes out individually, which is the style of izakaya.  thus, my stomach digested each dish before the next one even came out.  my hunger level stayed the same.  all the dish were delicious though.  maybe because of the wait but i like to think everything was cooked carefully.  my favorite dishes were: enoki mushroom with bacon, <mark>Juicy Deep Fried Chicken</mark>, and the bluefin sashimi special they had.  thankfully, i ordered an oyako don (chicken and egg) to satisfy my hunger.  \n\nservice was okay.  i didn't like being told that we had to finish by 930pm as we were being seated, despite waiting for over 1.5 hours.  i debated between a 3 or a 4 star rating.  i gave raku 4 stars because it is not your average japanese restaurant.  the food is definitely high tier.  i would just come here with a reservation next time.", 
            "i was so thrilled to try this place out, but i didn't leave here super pleased. :(\n\nbefore i start this review, i must say that i am not a fan of seafood aka raw fish aka fish aka most of the things on the menu. i prefer cooked foods, chicken, vegetables and red meat. so dun, dun dun, i tried the hiyashi chawanushi, <mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark>, <mark>Crispy Asparagus Okaki</mark>, <mark>Juicy Deep Fried Chicken</mark>, kobe beef filet, kobe beef skirt, grilled duck, and eggplant. \n\nhiyashi chawanushi: this dish was a daily special. i believe it was an <mark>Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard</mark> with crab and something else on top. like i said above, i'm not a fan of seafood, and this dish had such a fishy taste to it. i gagged a little after trying it, and i couldn't get rid of the fishy taste it left in my mouth. we left 90% of it left, because the dish itself was overwhelming.\n\n<mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark>: i have to agree with all the other yelpers. the best and most fresh tofu. get this!\n\n<mark>Crispy Asparagus Okaki</mark>: this dish comes with pieces of asparagus breaded with rice cracker. very delectable. \n\n<mark>Juicy Deep Fried Chicken</mark>: the best dish. like its name, it was six pieces of extremely mouthwatering chicken on a bed of spinach. the chicken itself was superb. the spinach and the sauce complimented the chicken. i definitely recommend this!\n\nkobe beef filet with wasabi/kobe beef skirt with garlic: very nice cuts of kobe beef. i liked the garlic one more, because all i could taste was wasabi and no meat. \n\ngrilled duck: i can't remember much about the duck except for its tangy aftertaste and chewiness. bleh, i guess i was expecting something different. thank goodness they present each table with tea afterwards, because i could not stand the aftertaste.\n\neggplant. grilled eggplant sprinkled with a ton of dried ginger. the eggplant was soft and appetizing, but the ginger ruined it for me. the ginger itself has a strong flavor, and i thought there was just too much ginger on there. i still ate it, but i took off most of the ginger.  \n\nof the eight dishes, i would only come back for the tofu, asparagus and <mark>Juicy Deep Fried Chicken</mark>. maybe we just ordered the wrong things, but i would not come back here. :c", 
            "ok so i just gave trattoria nakamura ya 5 stars and now i'm giving raku 5? \n\ndifferent types of cuisines in the same plaza and when i go to vegas next i'm going here again.  but probably not trattoria mainly bc i'm not as much into pasta. \n\nwe had a party of 5 and ordered the raku tofu, <mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark>, pork cheek skewers, kobe beef liver, kobe beef with garlic flank, fois <mark>Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard</mark>, grilled rice ball with salmon, <mark>Juicy Deep Fried Chicken</mark> and a few other things i'm forgetting but they were all awesome. they tell you the different ways to try everything, sometimes plain first then with their special green tea salt or one of the other special condiments. i'm a sucker for food on a stick...\n\ni wish i could've eaten more but we were full. the only disappointing thing was they didn't have the iberico pork that night. considering we ordered 10 things and paid $25/pp, were full and really enjoyed it there's nothing that would stop me from going back. i wish this place was in my hood, i'd go weekly.", 
            "this was the best dinner i have had in years. we were very lucky to get a reservation at the last minute, the hostess was very sweet and accommodating! the space itself is small, tastefully decorated, and feels like a step outside of vegas entirely- it's quietly luxurious, with intimate tables and dimmed lighting. the minute we sat down, our waiter came over and explained the specials, one of which we decided to order, the sukiyaki. we started with the raku tofu, which you would have to be crazy not to try. it is unlike anything i have ever experienced. the wait staff explain how best to enjoy it (first with some green tea salt, then with some ginger, green onion, and bonito flakes with a bit of soy sauce), and it is unbelievably delicious and silky. even if you don't usually like tofu, i highly recommend trying this! we also tried the <mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark>, which was equally delicious and served in a perfectly seasoned broth with nori flakes and salmon roe, and a little spot of chili sauce on the side of the bowl to be used sparingly. next we tried the kobe beef with garlic, which was another huge hit- incredibly flavorful, tender, just perfect. i am no steak expert, but my boyfriend is, and he was just as blown away as i was. we had the crispy <mark>Juicy Deep Fried Chicken</mark>, which was served on top of a bed of spinach dressed with what i think was a soy vinaigrette- amazing. then came the duck in a balsamic soy glaze, which is another must-order here- again, completely unlike anything i've ever tasted. we shared one stuffed small portobello, which was outstanding, and then came the sukiyaki. if they have this special when you visit, i cannot recommend it highly enough. it comes with eggs, which you crack into your own bowl and then use as a dipping sauce- i didn't do that part, but the sukiyaki itself was just unreal. the broth was perfect, not too salty but by no means bland, and there were noodles, tofu, greens, japanese eggplant, and the most amazing, thin sliced beef either of us had ever tasted. we made the mistake of ordering one too many things, and by the time the grilled rice balls (aka onigiri but without the nori) arrived, we were both right on the verge of being too full. if you are a fan of really high quality rice, you will love these- one is brown rice and flavored with bonito flakes, and one is white rice with a shinto leaf wrapped around it. both are of course fantastic, but for us they weren't the stars of the evening the way the tofu and beef had been. and of course it wasn't over, we ordered the fluffy cheesecake- both of us gasped when we tried it. it is like eating a cheesecake cloud. it is the lightest, fluffiest cheesecake that exists on earth, i am sure of it. even if you decide to follow up your meal with a trip to sweets raku (it was closed when we went, otherwise we probably would have gone- next time for sure!), this is another must. on top of the beyond amazing food, they have a fantastic wine and sake list, and the service was truly exceptional. warm, attentive, prompt, helpful- it felt like we were being spoiled! i seriously can't recommend raku highly enough. we will be coming back all the time!", 
            "raku is sooooo yummyly-bomb! like the big kind of yummyly-bomb. \n\nbe sure to make reservations though because the place is small and very popular and a lot of the time it's hard to get a seat showing up unannounced. so make a reservation to be on the safe side.\n\nmy boyfriend and i have only been once. primarily because when we went, we ordered a ton of stuff and our bill for just the two of us was $$$$$, so we had to limit ourselves.\n\nwe started we the kobe liver sashimi which was recommended to us by a friend, but it was definitely not our cup of tea. raw liver, which tastes resembled a penny lingering in my mouth, was only bearable due to the crispy garlic and small drop of oil on top. i can say i tried it, but we most likely never order it again. we also tried the special of the day which was a ahi toro sashimi. that was a little pricey but well worth it. the toro is the fattier part of the tuna belly and boy did it melt in your mouth. so amazing.\n\nnext came the foie gras with the soy-glazed base as well as the kobe skirt steak with garlic. this was the first time i've tried foie gras and if that's what all foie gras taste like, holy cow! i've just hopped on the foie gras train to the party in my mouth. we also ordered the <mark>Juicy Deep Fried Chicken</mark> and that was delicious as well. everything we order was on point (excluding that liver sashimi but that was my fault for wanting to be adventurous and thinking i'd like raw beef liver, so i don't hold it against raku).\n\ni hope we can return so to try more tasty treats! \n\noh yeah, we also have to check out sweets raku a couple of doors down. it's their dessert joint.", 
            "i loved the dessert place sweets raku so much that i had to try its sister restaurant.  it did not dissapoint!  i'm from san francisco which is a pretty high culinary bar.  this place exceeded my expectations from the decor, to the service, to the food!  kudos!  i loved the kobe tendon (could've eaten 5 but settled on sharing 2).  we loved the foie gras, kurobuto pork cheek, buttered scallop, <mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark>, asparagus/bacon, <mark>Juicy Deep Fried Chicken</mark>, etc...  i don't think you can go wrong with anything here!  we didn't try the soups, sukiyaki, or raw fish.",

            "after two more visits to raku since my last review, it deserves another update.  i'm not going to dive too much into this review because you all already know this place is good, especially if you've read my past reviews.  service is still top notch and the food is still impeccable.\n\nbut i will share with you some of the highlights during those two visits.\n\nraku tofu --  http://bit.ly/1zaxexb\nno matter how many times i order this, i'm always blown away by how creamy raku's cold tofu is.\n\n<mark>Juicy Deep Fried Chicken</mark> -- http://bit.ly/1p0x6cd\nthis is not your usual chicken karaage.  it's better!  it's literally very juicy and very flavorful along with the crispy skin.\n\n<mark>Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard</mark> -- http://bit.ly/1zayovv\nalong with the raku tofu, this is still a must order and also my personal favorite.\n\nfoie gras rice bowl --  http://bit.ly/1kev43i\nbig hunk of foie gras over rice.  it's a good thing to order if you don't get the custard.\n\nduck with balsamic soy --  http://bit.ly/1v66omu\ni saw this on their facebook page and it looked and sounded really good.  the duck was cooked nicely.\n\nkobe beef w/ wasabi --  http://bit.ly/1zaxrtc\ntheir kobe beef yakitori are always amazing.  and this one of course has a nice kick with the fresh wasabi.\n\noyako don --  http://bit.ly/1v666fd\nif you've followed my reviews and pics before, you probably know that lately i've been on an oyako don hunt.  raku's is good and filling, but pretty much is the same as the other places i've had it, and that's not a bad thing.\n\nalso on a side note, i don't think i've actually mentioned this before in my past reviews, but their toilet is awesome!  -- http://bit.ly/1v65k8o\nit has a heated seat and cleaning controls are above the handrail.  it's an experience you have to try!  seriously!\n\nas you can see raku still delivers and is still my favorite japanese restaurant of all time.  i was a little worried when anthony bourdain taped his show here thinking that the added exposure would make it harder to land a table here but that hasn't been the case with my last pair of visits.  for that i'm glad because for me, a foodie trip to vegas without raku would be so incomplete.", 
            "i'm from the midwest area, which authentic japanese dining is very limited. everytime i visit vegas ( at least twice per year), i would make a reservation for raku. the restaurant is limited in space and highly rcmd reservation (they usually seat reservation in one of the private booth/room). rcmd checking out the bathroom which has a fish tank and heated toilet.  i've been to raku for few times and these reviews are based on all the items i've tried. sometimes, there may be a language barrier and was difficult to understand the type of fish or entree for the daily special. \n\nskewers: the price on the menu is for one skewer. skewers are cooked over a special type of charcoal from japan, therefore you would really taste a bbq/charcoal flavor in the meat.\n\nkobe tendon - rcmd sharing this skewer with others. the tendon which is good fat, would melt like butter in your mouth. don't consume too much of it because it very heavy in taste. i would just take a bite of it for sampling. \n\nkobe beef filet with wasabi - $12 a skewer for kobe filet which was a thick cut. it was good, but it was okay. maybe it was too well done, i prefer medium rare. personally, i think the kobe skirt which was thinly sliced tasted better.\n\nkobe beef outside skirt $8- one of my favorite skewer, the beef was tender and tad of charcoal taste to it. not too overdone and just right. \n\nbeef tongue - delicious and it's a bit crispy and bouncy to the taste, \n\nkurobuta pork cheek - very tasty. love it.\n\nchicken - i always order the wrong chicken or  different chicken skewer but it's all tender and juicy,\n\nyellowtail $7 - good deal for a tasty filet of yellowtail with glazed sweet sauce over it. it was flaming delicious. \n\neggplant - direct flamed eggplant that was covered with bonito flake. it was not spectacular, but average.\n\nregular food item:\nraku tofu - home made tofu that is nicely presented. i usually sprinkle with the matcha sea salt and bit of the house soy sauce. my usual appetizer that i order every time.\n\nudon with <mark>Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard</mark> soup - the udon is served cold in a basket and i think it's homemade because it's not the typical thick udon. the foie gras is infused in the <mark>Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard</mark>. you dip the cold udon into the warm <mark>Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard</mark> soup. sooo hearty... unfortunately, i flll up on the skewer and never have room for the udon.\n\n<mark>Poached Egg</mark> with sea urchin and salmon roe - pretty much everything mixed together in a small bowl. it's all raw and raw. the taste was okay and fresh, but not amazing. the texture was slimy been there, done that.. ill try something else next time\n\n<mark>Juicy Deep Fried Chicken</mark> - <mark>Juicy Deep Fried Chicken</mark> and the chicken was juicy and tender. \n\ngrilled rice ball -  a ball of rice that is fried on the outside. cool concept, but i'll skip it and save room for the skewers.\n\ndaily chef's special:\nrock fish - the whole fish was served in chunks of sashimi which was sweet and extremely fresh. my friend and i finished the whole fish. soy sauce and wasabi is not needed, just chew it raw!!!  it's very reasonable for $45. later, the bones of the fish was fried and served. this is one of my favorite fish.\n\nwagyu beef sukiyaki - do you know how difficult to find a restaurant that serves sukiyaki the right way? most place would just dump the meat and the vegetable in a bowl and serve it.  raku does it just like how it's done in tokyo! the vegetable are cooking over a pot of charcoal claypot and the raw meat is placed atop and simmers to your liking. the waiter would crack a raw egg in a bowl and it's used for dipping for the meat. love it and i wish there was more meat to it.\n\noverall, one of my favorite robata grill. after the meal, it's pretty heavy and you might to drink some alcohol with your meal. the plaza that this restaurant is located is a foodie paradise. in this plaza, there is sweets raku, monta ramen, kung fu tea, snowflake shavery ice, kabuto, japanese curry, and japanese italian noodle (not sure of the name).",

            "i have been coming to raku for almost 10 years and what i truly love about raku is that every single time i dine here .. it's always consistently delicious! this is by far one of my favorite restaurants in lv or even in the united states. \n\nmy husband and i both love raku and we both have very different loves.\n\nmy must orders: pouched egg w uni and salmon roe ; raku or <mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark> ; foie gras \n\nhis must orders : pig ear ; teba wings ; chicken breast w chicken skin; \n\nours loves : tendon ; <mark>Juicy Deep Fried Chicken</mark> ; miso soup ; and fluffy cheesecake ! \n\nwhat can we say : we love raku !!! we loved it so much we had our wedding cake fr them!", 
            "raku is one of those vegas-exclusive dining experiences every local has to have at least once. i lived here nearly a year and a half and finally found an occasion worthy of a family dinner at raku. \n\nappetizers\nraku's tofu: worth at least trying, great silky texture\nkobe beef liver sashimi: there's no getting around the strong liver taste, it's not for everyone. the roasted garlic chips add flavor and texture.\n<mark>Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard</mark>: great dish, minimal foie but still very enjoyable. there was also some roe in this that we hadn't expected.\n<mark>Poached Egg</mark> with sea urchin and salmon roe: this dish wasn't for me at all. i like <mark>Poached Egg</mark>, and urchin, and roe, but this didn't come together and the egg was closer to raw than poached.\n<mark>Juicy Deep Fried Chicken</mark>: an incredible introduction to the wonderful chicken dishes raku's kitchen puts out, even the spinach garnish was delicious\n\nrice & noodle\ngrilled rice ball in broth with salmon: great pick. light broth that tasted more like a tea due to the steeped seaweed in the dish. rice retains the grilled texture despite being soaked in broth. salmon surcharge was $3 but piece of fish was the size of a thumb nail, didn't contribute anything to the flavor.\n\nrobata\nchicken thigh & chicken breast wrapped with chicken skin: the chicken robata dishes were my favorites, with a smoky grilled taste and juicy beyond belief\nkobe beef filet with wasabi: the beef was good, but i'm not a fan of wasabi so that kind of ruined this for me\nkobe beef tendon: nope. not happening. too adventurous for me.\npork ear: tasty with lots of texture. server recommends their spicy table sauce, which was basically a punch of straight-up pepper. i'd recommend it without.\nduck with balsamic soy sauce: ordered two of these knowing i'd love it, and i did. lacked the gamey taste that turns a lot of people off to duck. good choice.\ntomato with bacon & mushroom with bacon: i'm not generally a bacon fan, but adding a veggie into the mix somehow does it for me. \n\ndessert\nfluffy cheesecake: i'm not a dessert fan, and found this a bit too cheesy for me, but when you get to the raspberry filling? oh man, all bets are off. \n\nabove meal was under $200 with a carafe of ashahi ($30) and tip, and enough for three to share happily. service was just okay, polite and professional but detached and didn't make a connection or any recommendations even when we mentioned it was our first visit. make sure to take at least one trip to the bathroom, it's beautiful.\n\nwe made reservations a few days in advance, and staff were awesome about calling us back when they were unable to pick up. reservations secure your table for 15 minutes (show up on time!), and you get the table for 2 hours. toward the end of the night (11pm?) people were able to walk-in for bar seats.", 
            "finally\n\ni have had raku in my cross hairs for many, many years.  the idea of finding parking in an extremely under sized lot without street parking and waiting outside in the sweltering heat amongst smoking fiends was an absolute deterrent.  but lately my commute schedule forces me to look for restaurants opened pass midnight.  gambled that a midnight attempt during a thursday would be in our favor. good thing i made the call first hand from mccarran and followed up with a reservation.  without having to wait, we were seated promptly in the first dining room that includes the vista of the bar, kitchen service window and everyone entering the restaurant.  the other half or adjacent room has at least one private room and other seating arrangements plus their single unisex restroom.\n\nthe two sided menu is cleverly sandwiched in glass and housed in a slot holster at each table.  majority of the diners are newbies and studiously referencing to their smartphones for eye catching suggestions on yelp.  don't be embarrassed. ... we're doing the same too.  there are just too many tempting menu items. we ordered seven items with the <mark>Juicy Deep Fried Chicken</mark> as a last moment add on and eighth and last item.\n\n\ncold  dishes:\n\nhomemade tofu - raku whole order served with a side of chili garlic sauce and japanese mustard green ... uniquely raku's .... dense, slightly cream like experience\n\nwaygu beef sashimi with special blended soy sauce (not on menu, by request only) ...  beef eater's dream come true\n\n<mark>Yellowtail Carpaccio</mark> served with special , soy sauce blend topped with yuzu and daikon ... every table ordered\n\n<mark>Poached Egg</mark> with sea urchin and salmon roe ...  you will live to be 110 years old ... very popular amongst male diners\n\n\nhot dishes:\n\nkurobuta pork belly with spinach and mustard on top ... must eat together with all ingredients for total satisfaction\n\n<mark>Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard</mark> with grilled duck on top ... is your tongue long enough to touch the bottom of your cup ?\n\n<mark>Juicy Deep Fried Chicken</mark> (not on menu, by request only)  ...  assured  a filling and grand experience\n\nrobata grill butter sauteed scallop ... only dish that failed to stoke my taste buds ... scallop was over cooked and partially chewy and tough.\n\nunfortunately, the very pretty lady reading the chalkboard specials had a very thick japanese accent and we didn't understand most of what she was attempting to promote. the ambiance is simple and strong, while ceiling p<mark>Veggie Pork Intestine In Pot</mark> table lighting greatly assisted in reading the small print on the menu and made food photography a cinch.  all in all it was a very memorable dining experience and essentially fulfillled my expectations of what is deemed refined japanese cuisine.\n\nthis is my review #666.", 
            "hits: raku tofu, crispy asparagus, <mark>Yellowtail Carpaccio</mark>,  <mark>Juicy Deep Fried Chicken</mark>, bacon wrapped enoki mushroom, kobe steak with garlic, buttery scallop,  <mark>Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard</mark> soup\n\nmisses: the special snapper (too small and not a lot of meat), iberico pork wasn't as soft as i thought it would be, and <mark>Crispy Fried Shrimp</mark>. we did send back the iberico pork and they made us another one which was softer, but still i felt it wasn't worth the $10 per skewer. better off getting kobe steak.\n\np. s. remember to save room to go to raku sweets for dessert!", 
            "raku is the place to go to if you want to try something different. it's really all about \"quality over quantity\". the only reason why i gave 4 stars and not 5 was because our <mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark> didn't come out until towards the end even though it's an \"appetizer\". also, i made the mistake of ordering the <mark>Poached Egg</mark> with uni and salmon roe, it just wasn't for me. although, make sure to order the <mark>Juicy Deep Fried Chicken</mark>! honestly, the best piece of chicken i've ever eaten lol. the <mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark> is a must and so is the kobe beef with wasabi. best dish of the night was the alaskan king crab, the freshest and sweetest crab meat i've ever tasted (it was one of their specialty dishes for that night). shout out to my sister for treating us to dinner. she real af for that.", 
            "rsvpd a few days in advance for dinner at 6:30 on a thursday. we didn't need to wait once we arrived, and luckily got seated towards the quieter back. \n\nwhat we got:\n\n<mark>Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard</mark>- love steamed scrambled egg, chinese people eat it with cooking wine, but their foie gras infusion was killer. great texture too. the only thing i don't like about foie gras, well one of the things, is the livery aftertaste. the custard still had that aftertaste. \n\nfoie gras skewer- for $17 it didn't disappoint. literally melt in your mouth! could've been enough for four i think, but our foie gras aficionado finished it off for us. \n\ngreen tea cold noodle - nice, simple dish that contrasted with the rich, flavorful dishes we ordered afterward. i don't know what the process is for serving cold dishes first, but i would've appreciated this cold noodle more after eating the foie gras. light dish in contrast to the heavy richness of the foie gras. \n\nscallop - served in a hot shell. i didn't think it was amazing. \n\nsea urchin with salmon roe- i'm not a uni fan, but this combo with the <mark>Poached Egg</mark> was awesome. sweet, light, gooey, & interesting textures (bubble like roe & mushrooms held together by the gooey egg yolk). like how the yolk balanced out the uni. \n\n<mark>Sashimi Salad</mark> - that was delicious. i loved the sashimi with the miso dressing. refreshing way to whet our appetites. \n\nraku tofu- you can dress it two ways, and i preferred the chives + soy sauce way. the more i ate it the hungrier i got - so as an appetizer it did its job (making us hungrier and ready for the heartier meat dishes). \n\niberian pork skewers - a special at $10/skewer. i thought it was a tad undercooked, but the meat was definitely tender and fatty. not a huge fan though and prob won't order it again. \n\nwaygu beef sashimi - aka raw beef. after eating this i realized i like my beef cooked medium rare. the beef was tender, but really chewy due to the fat on it. like people in my party were having trouble eating it it was so chewy. at $20 a plate, i'd skip this at the next go round. \n\n<mark>Juicy Deep Fried Chicken</mark>: dark chicken meat cooked like a pot roast, but with a thin crispy skin (like roast duck skin except with chicken). chicken was underdone. truth be told, we only ordered it bc the table next to us ordered it and i'm a fattie that loves me some <mark>Juicy Deep Fried Chicken</mark>. \n\noverall: i generally thought everything needed some salt (not the green tea salt on the table), and most of the red meats and \"other white meats\" could've been cooked slightly more. \n\nservice was very polite, though slightly over attentive. i'm not used to someone constantly coming by your table, switching out your plates after every two dishes, etc. \n\nand it's a very clean restaurant! i read in a cooking book (kitchen confidential) that you can tell how clean a kitchen is by how clean the bathrooms are. the bathroom here was very clean, very japanese (ie super high tech toilets that required actual reading to operate) with an aquarium! i guess they were trying to make us feel like we were in an aquarium too with the blue walls & tile (i'm analyzing this bathroom waaaay too much...).", 
            "unexpectedly impressed!  will come back tomorrow in a heartbeat! service and food were outstanding, and the price, unbelievable!\n\nstarted with raku tofu, housemade and as silken as they can come, with bonito flakes, scallions and garlic on the side (a must)! we also had wagyu beef sashimi (loved it), kobe beef liver sashimi (hub's favorite), <mark>Poached Egg</mark>, uni and salmon roe (omg!), <mark>Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard</mark> (foie gras in every bite), ikura don (went well with everything), <mark>Juicy Deep Fried Chicken</mark> (oh so tender, juicy and tasty), pork cheeks (flavorful), pig ears (crunchy) and kobe beef tendons (my dessert!). where can you find all these delectable dishes??? not in sf!!  \n\ni like how the waitress let us know in what order the food should be eaten (cuz we kept asking for the ikura bowl and the <mark>Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard</mark> that they held back), from tofu, salad, cold dishes, grilled items to rice bowls.   and which of the special sauce and seasonings to use that is available on each table.\n\nordered a bottle of domaine du chalet pouilly fuisse to wash all that yumminess down!  our first meal of a 7-day stay....boy, it's gonna be hard to beat!", 
            "so much food, not enough belly room!  this dining establishment is a hidden gem located within a busy plaza in chinatown.  i had called weeks prior to the date of arrival trying to get a reservation.  unfortunately, no one picked up my three phone call attempts on various days.  that was very disappointing.  \n\non saturday night, the gf and i decided to come here in hopes of scoring a table without reservations.  we were greeted by the hostess, and she said we would be able to sit at the bar in about ten minutes.  five minutes pass and we ask her if we would be able to get a table instead.  she says no, and that they are booked for the night.  then, a couple minutes later, she tells us someone who made reservations did not show up!  \n\nthe menu is one page, front and back, with lots of options that will make your mouth water.  we decided on the infamous <mark>Rakus Tofu</mark>, <mark>Juicy Deep Fried Chicken</mark>, <mark>Crispy Asparagus Okaki</mark>, corn potato, butter sauted scallop, foie gras don, soboro don, and the waygu beef sashimi.  \n\nthe tofu was no joke.  it was the freshest i have ever eaten.  the ingredients used to pair  with the tofu complimented each other perfectly.  make sure to try the green tea salt because that is what the chef recommended first.  out of all the dishes, the plating on this one was the most creative.  the asparagus came next, accompanied by the corn potato.   the asparagus coated in the tempura batter was mind blowing.  the outside was so crunchy, and was a pleasant surprise.  the corn potato was my favorite dish.  never could a dish be so simple, yet so elegantly presented.  i do not know how they did it, but hats off to them.  \n\nnext up was the waygu beef sashimi, buttered scallop, andthe <mark>Juicy Deep Fried Chicken</mark>.  the waygu slices were ultra thin, and such top tier cuts.  i practically ate the whole thing, and still wanted more!  the scallop was served on its shell, and the light sauce drizzled on top was very good.  the scallop itself was a tad bit chewy, and there were two hard mystery pieces that needed to be spat out.  the juicy, <mark>Juicy Deep Fried Chicken</mark> was very good.  although i wished it had been more crispy, it was definitely juicy.  i would have enjoyed it more had there been no chewy tendons in some bites.  \n\nthe foie gras don and soboro don came out last.  the foie gras was everything one could hope for, and so much more.  the buttery duck was well worth the wait.  the sauce that went with it was so good.  the soboro don was just okay.  i could have done without the pickled mustard, and there was no sauce to go with the dish.  \n\noverall, i am definitely impressed by this place.  i will also have to check out raku sweets as well!", 
            "one of my favorite dining experiences, ever.  great food, great ambiance, great service.  when i visit vegas, i like getting away from the strip for at least one meal, and i'm glad i came here last vegas trip.  raku is a small japanese restaurant, so you'll want to make reservations in advance.  \n\nhere's what i had:\n-blue fin sashimi\n-<mark>Yellowtail Carpaccio</mark>\n-kobe beef filet with wasabi\n-wagyu beef sashimi\n-<mark>Juicy Deep Fried Chicken</mark>\n-<mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark>\n-buttered scallop\n\nthe blue fin was the best blue fin i've ever had.  the <mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark> was the best <mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark> i've ever had.  the kobe beef filet \" ... \" .  you get the point.  raku is legit.  come here and treat yourself.", 
            "food and service top notch. could not have been better. chairs were a bit uncomfortable hence the knockoff of a star. did i mention this restaurant serves its menu as small sharing plates? the food ordered was for two people. \nin no particular order we enjoyed:\nraku tofu 1/2 order\n<mark>Yellowtail Carpaccio</mark>\niberico pork\n<mark>Juicy Deep Fried Chicken</mark>\nkurobuta pork belly\nbuttered scallops with soy\nmatsutake grill\nportabella stuff with asajime chicken\nduch with balsamic soy sauce.\nour favorites were the tofu, scallops, duck with balsamic, and the yellow tail carpaccio. each dish was absolutely tasty and had various spices served with the dishes to highlight the dishes. \nonly a few seats so reservations are a must. if you don't pig out, (we did) try the raku sweets in the next building for some amazingly crafted and beautiful to look at and better to taste dessert offerings.", 
            "we made an impromptu trip to vegas but heard such good things about raku, we knew we wanted to check it out. so we called and asked if they had any openings for a party of 4 on friday or saturday. we lucked out and got reservations for 11:00pm on a friday night! score! \n\nwe did the small omakase (chef's choice) $75/person and omg it came with 11 dishes! we were so stuffed and it was so sad that we couldn't even eat all the delicious food. i have no idea what the $100 omakase would come with since i was extremely satisfied with the chef's choices we were given. \n\n1) homemade tofu- best i ever had. added a little of their special seasonings and the tofu just melted in my mouth. \n\n2) sashimi sampler platter- beautiful presentation and nice variety. \n\n3) <mark>Juicy Deep Fried Chicken</mark>- crispy and full of flavor\n\n4) bacon wrapped enoki- bite size and on skewers. \n\n5) small barracuda- light, soft and flavorful. the server sliced the fish opened and who would have thought this thin fish would be so meaty. \n\n6) kobe beef skewers with fried garlic- i actually thought these were a little tough but had good flavor. \n\n7) pork cheek- a little too fatty for me but some of the others in my group loved this so they ate my portion.\n\n8) agedashi salmon- the dashi had excellent flavor and i wish i had a bowl of hot rice to eat this with. \n\n9) tuna tartar- i actually with this one had come before the salmon so i could have the rice. but the tuna was placed on top of a thin layer of nori and on top of a hot cup of rice. so tasty!\n\n10) fluffy cheesecake- whatever this was it just melted in my mouth. soft, not too sweet, just perfect. \n\n11) strawberry sorbet- so fresh!\n\noverall, an excellent dining experience! plan to spend at least 2 hours to fully enjoy the food and ambiance!"

            "wow...what a place.  it's tiny, interesting looking interior-wise with chocolate walls and low lighting that make everyone look good.  walls are lined with banquettes -- and tables in the middle can be pushed together for large groups -- but remember, this place is tiny, and the tables don't turn quickly at all.  we were there for two and a half hours and only 1 table left.  the only \"leaving\" is when folks head outside to smoke.\n\nwhat i loved was that my husband had taken a group here a few weeks ago (brett below) was with him...and they had a monumental meal that made him feel guilty he'd not taken me first so we went last night and i thought it was spectacular with one lapse in service and food to knock one star off 5, but it was still dynamite.  \n\nthey were out of unfiltered sake which made him pout, but our server made an excellent recommendation on a bottle that we loved -- only problem was it went down too easily, and since they were low, wouldn't sell us a second...mid meal....\n\nstarted with skewered cherry tomatoes -- lightly salted that were still amazingly cool in the center.  we both could have eaten a pound of these.  we had a japanese version of caprese salad that blew my mind <mark>Sunomono - Cucumber And Seaweed</mark> for basil, sliced tomatoes, the creamiest tofu ever for mozzarella and for interest on top - and to take it so over the top that i was in awe -- teeny tiny baby eels that were fried to crispy sprinkled lightly on top.  he sprinkled green tea salt on the top and i was blown away.  \n\nthe <mark>Sashimi Salad</mark> with tuna and salmon, spinach and dressing of soy, yuzu and crispy shallots was to die for on such a hot night.\n\nthen we had fried octopus -- wow.  flavors that exploded in your mouth -- really satisfying and so simple.\n\nwhole <mark>Crispy Fried Shrimp</mark> were great and made for great comedy at the table -- a la bean on vacance in france a la gare...  if you saw the movie, you'll get the reference since you eat these whole -- we liked them much more than bean did. \n\nthis was where things fell apart -- where we'd had food coming out -- small plates -- timed perfectly...suddenly the brakes hit hard and the whole restaurant came to a standstill.  i jokingly said mused that the chef left to buy cigarettes...because seriously nothing came out of the kitchen for about 30 minutes.  \n\nthen magically, things slowly began to fire again...next we had foie gras skewers, terrific baby lamb chops and some raku seaweed and turnips, then some lovely chicken thighs, then a special dashi broth with snapper, shitake mushrooms, japanese eggplant and a lovely okra...then out came two of my favorites -- a chawanmushi with duck and foie gras and dashi broth -- yowza...absolutely mind blowing.  the flavor combination was amazing -- the smokey duck, the sweetness of the dashi, the creaminess of the cusard, the richness of the foie...just terrific...then skewers  of shishito peppers  -- if you've never had these and you like green chilis these rock.   \n\nthen we had one final dish that interestingly was my least favorite -- ground chicken on chopsticks that looked like corndogs but had oddly very little flavor...  or maybe i'd hit the wall...either way, we were officially maxed out -- the bill -- huge -- $240 before tip -- but that was with $100 in sake alone -- and the plates while numerous, were very very tiny...\n\nbut we loved it and i highly recommend checking it out... in true izakaya fashion this place is open late.  go with friends to taste and try everything -- order pitchers of beer, sake, have fun.  it's a great addition to town.", 
            "went here on a whim while in vegas for the weekend.  no reservations, we didnt realize how tiny it was and how popular it was.  they fit us in which was very much appreciated.  \nthis place is amazing!  \neverything we ordered was...whats another word for amazing? extraordinary!  \nseriously...the sake is perfectly ice cold, the beers are nice and cold. \nwe had:\nfried tofu in broth\nchicken portobella skewer\nkobe filet skewer\n<mark>Crispy Fried Shrimp</mark> (so amazing)\nand a squid special that was expensive but so different than anything we have ever had - the whole squid by the way - a pretty big one.\n\ni cant wait to go back to vegas just to return to this place.  in fact i want to move to vegas just so i can become a regular here.\n\nthe service is great the ambiance is good.  bathroom is super cute like others have said.  they put a lot of thought into the space and  it shows!\n\nvegas this weekend anyone?",

            "i wonder if this place has any connection to the original raku that opened up in vancouver?  it's certainly in line with the string of izakaya's we have up here.\n\nraku is classier, less trendy and boisterous than the vancouver izakaya's, but the food is solid.  \n\nof the hits, the foie gras with <mark>Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard</mark> appetizer - the custard is the winner, subtly foie flavoured and so silky.  the foie gras on top was a bit tough with a layer of fat.  made for a chewy mouthful instead of one that should have melted with the custard.\n\nthe deep-<mark>Crispy Fried Shrimp</mark> special were great - crackly, salty, fresh.  eat the shell, eat the head - leave the eyeballs.  \n\ntheir home-made tofu is also a winner.  we tried it both ways, cold - served in a half moon, with green tea salt and agedashi hot fried - served in a nice broth and garnished with salmon roe.  \n\nthe kobe beef with wasabi skewer was nicely smokey and tender.  not as much marbling as i would have liked.  \n\ntheir red snapper sashimi special was amazingly fresh.  i was impressed, i wasn't expecting to find that kind of quality here. \n\ntheir green tea creme brulee is well-executed, served with green tea ice cream and whipped cream that i could have done without.  their bubbly brown sugar pudding is interesting.  the bubbly part comes from frothed up milk?  it's quite bland, you need to eat it with the jelly-like brown sugar pudding.\n\nthis place would be great as a first-date night.  service was first-rate, clearing dishes at almost every round of food.", 
            "come.  eat.  enjoy.  \n\nprobably one of the best meals i have ever had, eaten in a small joint in a strip mall a few miles away from the strip.  about a 15 minute cab ride away, this place is absolutely worth every (well-priced) penny you'll spend here.\n\ni was a bit confused before i came, and i would have thought that this would have been addressed by some reviewers beforehand, but i'll give it a go.  the raku menu is full of single items (i.e., $1.50 for a chicken wing, $9 for a a strip of kobe steak, etc.)  there are also appetizers that can be ordered that are enough to share with the table.  or, if you're like me, you'll not want to share at all.\n\nhonestly, and i'm not saying this to be lazy, everything we ate was delicious.  there was fried tofu swimming in broth, chicken wings, fish, rice cakes, kobe beef with wasabi, and probably the best <mark>Crispy Fried Shrimp</mark> i have ever had.  \n\njust go.  you will not be disappointed.",

            "4.5 stars\n\nraku is one of the off-strip las vegas restaurants i hear most about. raku's charcoal-grilled robata is one of the restaurant's specialties, but they also offer a variety of fresh fish and an assortment of cold and hot plates. before going in, i asked around for recommendations and the answers i got spanned the whole menu. clearly, the restaurant does a lot of things well.\n\nwe ordered a bunch of things in no particular order, but started with an amuse from the kitchen.\n\ntaiwanese spinach, enoki mushrooms, shitake mushrooms, bonito flakes - light and refreshing, this was a nice start to the meal.\n\nbluefin tuna sashimi - the restaurant has a chalkboard of daily specials, and this was one of them. oh my goodness...this was fantastic. exceptionally flavored and really tender, this was so good. easily better than much of the toro (and this wasn't toro) i've had in other restaurants; it briefly reminded me of urasawa.\n\n<mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark> - this homemade tofu was very good - soft and delicate with a subtle but present soy flavor. prepared agedashi style, the umami-rich broth was also very good.\n\n<mark>Crispy Fried Shrimp</mark> - the shrimp here were crispy as advertised and moist on the inside. nothing special really, but good. i'm never really sure if i'm supposed to eat these sort of things in its entirety, shell-on; but we did in this case.\n\n<mark>Crispy Asparagus Okaki</mark> - another crispy dish, i enjoyed the contrasting tenderness of the asparagus with the crispy rice cracker breading. there was a nuttiness to the breading, which i thought also went well with the vegetable.\n\n<mark>Juicy Deep Fried Chicken</mark> - this was a little bit unique as it seemed to be chicken that was rolled up, then fried and cut. juicy on the inside and crispy on the outside - no complaints here.\n\n<mark>Yellowtail Carpaccio</mark> - the fish was good here, but the bluefin spoiled me a bit as it didn't seem as special. still, the wasabi and yuzukosho did a nice job of brightening up the yellowtail in this dish.\n\nfish of the day - yellowback seabream - this was one of the fish of the day, served whole. it was a pretty small dish with only about 8 chunks of white flesh. it was very good though, with a crispy exterior from the deep frying.\n\n<mark>Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard</mark> - the custard was silky smooth with a fairly subtle foie gras flavor. very comforting. the piece of duck breast on top was pretty good too.\n\nwe proceeded with a number of robata-grilled dishes.\n\nbutter saut\\u00e9ed scallop with soy sauce - the scallop (served in its shell) was cooked well, but i thought the butter was a little overpowering here.\n\nchicken thigh - this was the first piece where i could really get a sense of the charcoal grill flavor. there was a smoky char on the chicken, and it was moist and flavorful. really simple and really good.\n\nkobe beef filet with wasabi - again, a good smoky flavor from the grill paired with some really flavorful tenderloin. surprisingly juicy and flavorful. i liked the fresh wasabi as well, countering the rich meat. delicious!\n\nkurobuta pork cheek - i was surprised to find this rather chewy, kind of like a chicken gizzard. maybe i just haven't really had cheek in this type of preparation. it was well-marbled, and the porky flavor was present.\n\nkobe beef tendon - not my favorite. i never really like the tendon though, and this was like a big blob of gooey tendon. so meltingly tender, i wasn't sure if i was biting into fat or tendon. i think this was probably a very good preparation, but it's not my thing.\n\nduck with balsamic soy sauce - an interesting dish here - the duck was prepared well, and the balsamic soy and fresh onions did a good job of cutting through some of the richness.\n\napple marinated lamb chop - tender and juicy, this was a damn good lamb chop. i'm not sure if i got any apple flavor though, but i didn't mind.\n\nkobe beef outside skirt with garlic - really good. exceedingly tender and flavorful, with a nice garlic touch.\n\ni had high expectations for raku and i wasn't disappointed. in fact, it exceeded them. after dining at places from joel robuchon and jose andres, it was nice to get something rather simple with clean, familiar flavors. almost like a detox, if you will. the raw fish preparations (ooh the bluefin!) and the robata-grilled items stood out most to me, but it was a well-rounded meal.", 
            "ordered just about all the specials the night we went\n\nhouse made tofu is good!\n\nsashimi dishes were super fresh\n\ni think the best dish of the night was the last to come out, the grilled foie gras\n\nwow, it was literally melt in your mouth.  i went two weeks ago and i can still taste the foie gras\n\nthe <mark>Crispy Fried Shrimp</mark> ball special was the only average dish of the night\n\neverything else was top quality.\n\nservice was as expected for a place so small, no complaints from me here.", 
            "stunning. easily the best japanese in the city. \n\nservice, atmosphere, menu, and preparation all 10 out of 10. pretentiousness/glam factor: 1 or 2 out of 10. sake menu diverse, competent, and not insultingly priced-- a rarity. \n\n<mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark> is mind blowing. <mark>Crispy Fried Shrimp</mark> excellent. fois <mark>Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard</mark> and noddle number is one of the best things i've had in years. years! soft boiled egg was different and expertly prepared. finished it off with lychee sorbet and 2 asahi drafts along the way. \n\nperfection and excellence. quality here made me ignore the final bill. 100% satisfaction.", 
            "when you start off knowing that all the major players eat here, you know you're in for a meal of a lifetime. not only does raku serve beautifully executed food, it's a bargain at 10+ courses for only $50pp. the icing on the cake is knowing that you may run into joel robuchon, guy savoy, or even mario batali in his orange crocs. raku is the only place that has managed to \"wow\" me even more on the second visit as compared to the first. and that's not discounting the first meal because that was exquisite in and of itself. however on the second visit, raku was able to re-invent itself and offer even more delectables and a considerably different tasting menu that wowed my palate even more.\n\nthe restaurant is unassuming, located in a strip mall in chinatown. the decor is minimal with two bathrooms with serious personality. the service is unfussy but genuine and you can tell that they take great care in plating and execution without taking it too seriously. the flavors are clean and emphasis is on using only the best ingredients. all of the components of each dish are well thought out and serve a purpose. the results are nothing short of amazing.\n\nmy favorites are as follows:\n*<mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark> - homemade tofu melts in your mouth and the broth is heavenly, literally out of this world!\n*<mark>Juicy Deep Fried Chicken</mark> - amazingly <mark>Juicy Deep Fried Chicken</mark> wrapped in <mark>Juicy Deep Fried Chicken</mark> skin...need i say more...\n*<mark>Crispy Asparagus Okaki</mark> - the crispy fry on the outside of the asparagus adds the perfect crunch and toasted rice flavor to add incredible depth. add some green tea salt to bring out the flavors even more\n*dried tatmi <mark>Dried Tatami Sardine Salad</mark> - ceasar salad kicked up a notch, great briny and cheesy flavor\n*kurobuta pork cheek robata - juicy and great grill flavor from the robata\n*<mark>Fried Ice Fish</mark> - beautifully <mark>Fried Ice Fish</mark> served whole with fish nuggets in again, heavenly broth\n*enoki mushroom wrapped in bacon robata - it's wrapped with bacon...need i say more\n*<mark>Yellowtail Carpaccio</mark> - sashimi was incredibly fresh\n*grape tomatoes robata - so simple but simply delicious...add the green tea salt and you're going to be impressed and want to try to make it at home\n*salmon ikura don - beautifully presented and then served into individual portions. the ikura pops in your mouth to bring the taste of the ocean to the salmon rice.\n*udon noodle with <mark>Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard</mark> soup - the broth as well as the noodles were amazing\n*eel don with gobo - again, served with heavenly broth. the gobo added great depth by bringing a bit of earthy bitterness to balance the salty and sweet.\n*<mark>Crispy Fried Shrimp</mark> - fried little shrimpies, delicious.. \n*sorbet of the season - so simple, a strawberry sorbet with condensed milk. the combination makes the sorbet take on a creamy texture and the fruit flavor packs a good punch to end the meal. the kiwi one was delicious as well \n\n\nthe things i would forgo to save room for the things above:\nchicken thigh robata\nchicken breast wrapped with chicken skin robata\nkobe beef outside skirt with garlic robata\n<mark>Tofu Salad</mark> \"caprese\" with seaweed, tomatoes, and dried fishies", 
            "we attended the raku sake tasting event with a buffet for the price of $45.\n\npros\n1.) food:\n     -yellowtail and salmon sashima: very fresh, very good\n     -<mark>Crispy Fried Shrimp</mark> w/head attached:  flavorful\n     -bacon wrapped asparagus:  bacon goes well w/everything...good\n     -deep <mark>Fried Ice Fish</mark>:  nice snack to munch on\n     -raku oden:  i tried the beef tendon, daikon, taro noodles, and this awesome   thing with mochi in the middle...i wanna go back and have me a bowl of this deliciousness.\n     -pork cheek and kobe garlic skewers:  i will definitely come back to eat more of these skewers.\n    -lamb shank lollipop: very tender and juicy\n    -brown sugar pudding in milk, with a raisin:  i liked this very much, i had 4 bite-size servings of this.\n2.) service was great.  the staff were on their toes to clear out all the plates\n3.)there were many varieties of sakes, but my favorite was the riesling.  one small cup of this and i was good.  \n\ncons\n1.) venue:  small and cramped.  there were just so many people here.  \n2.) unorganized:  i had to keep going through the line to get food and there were times when i got to the front to get food, barely anything is there.  \n3.) there were people that didn't want to be civilized and wanted to just go up to the front and grab the food.  tsk tsk.\n\noverall, great event, great food, great times with great yelpers.  i'm a fan", 
            "i heard great things of the sake tasting so decided to come at the lure of unlimited drink and eats for $45. \n\nthere was about 20 sakes to try as well as light/dark asahi. sake isn't a spirit i am well versed in but know enough to see some of these are quality items. i was impressed with some of the smoothness and flavor of some of these and makes me rethink about adding a daiginjo sake into our spirit collection. \n\nthe buffet ranged from-\n\nrobatas: filet w/ garlic, chicken thigh, pork belly, bacon enoki, mushroom, tomato.\noden: 3kinds of fishcake, soybean curd wrapped mochi, beef tendons, chicken meatballs, seaweed, noodles, potato, radish. \napps: asparagus wrapped in panko/nuts, tempura <mark>Fried Ice Fish</mark>, <mark>Juicy Deep Fried Chicken</mark>, roast beef, tofu with tomato, cold tofu, whole <mark>Crispy Fried Shrimp</mark>, chopped seafood with/pickled bonito guts, sashimi w/ ponzu, baby radish to dip in fermented bean paste or mustard.\ndessert: brown sugar custard/jelly in condense milk with a dried goji berry.\n\ni probably missed a few things, but these were recurring items. i can see the quality of the food here definitely. the oden beef tendons are some of the best i've had. the robatas definitely get the special flavor of the binchotan charcoal imparted on them. the tofu has superb texture. \n\nnow the rub of this event- it was disneyland status wait. we waited to pay. we waited for food. no food was up there a few times we went so it was another wait for anything to come out. we waited to get to seat in one of the limited seating areas. the layout makes for intimate dining but is not very good for banquet style as many of the aisles are narrow and tables/areas aren't made for maximum utility. you can come later, but a lot of the food has been already attacked and i don't know how freshly made a ton of it will be. since it's usually pretty pricey to eat here, i probably did get my moneys worth even though i wouldn't say i was neither too drunk or too full by the time we decided to go already. \n\nthe food was good, but i don't know if i was floored by it enough to justify regular pricing. it's probably significantly better when it's not made in larger plates, but some i got straight from the kitchen piping hot. i also think i'm forever disappointed by my izakaya style meals here on out as none can top an epic night at shunju in roppongi for me. \n\nthere are some more gourmet items i'm still dying to try, so i will be back for a regular dining experience to try the more unique offerings and skip the basics this buffet has served.", 
            "delicious! my husband and i had been trying to eat here for the last 3 years but we either would for get the name or forget to make reservations. we celebrated our 2nd yr anniversary and it was definitely special. i like to describe it as japanese tapas, super fresh and yummy! here are the definite must haves:\n*<mark>Crispy Fried Shrimp</mark> as an appetizer you get about 8 and they are great!\n*kobe beef outside skirt with garlic\n*kobe beef fillet with wasabi- the wasabi is super taste and not harsh at all\n*butter saut\\u00e9ed scallop with soy sauce- get your own you wont want to share this was our #1 pick\n*portabella stuffed with ground chicken-\n*udon noodle with <mark>Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard</mark> soup- creamy and delicious definite worth the price. \n\nthe staff is so nice they explain things very well and don't leave with out checking out their bathrooms, they are awesome)", 
            "another excellent time at raku. everything, including the service, is excellent. however, my only complaint about raku occurs before you even get there...\n\nthe reservation process at raku needs help. i understand this is a hot place, but i fail to understand the restriction on placing reservations only between 1400 and 1700 hours, then not answering the phone at all after 1700 hours. the voice mail message also says no reservations by message or email, and there is no web-based system like open table here either. worse, the person taking the reservation wants all my personal info, and repeatedly warns me that there are other reservations and i have to be out by a certain time. this is dangerously close to serious pretentious snooty-ville, and i am hoping and praying that raku does not fall victim to its own success and get too arrogant for its own good. customer service first please. i realize american restaurants like to flip tables as fast as possible, but telling a customer to leave by a certain time is highly rude. worse, i heard this said to a few other customers while i was there in-person. wow.\n\ni happened to be out of the country, and i stayed up until midnight just to make the call at raku during their limited reservation window. yeah, i'm a little miffed at this and maybe being too much of a whiner, but all is forgiven because...\n\nall that being said, the food and service here is consistently stellar, and i will put up with this level of reservation combativeness as long as it doesn't get any worse. \n\nbtw, for all that reservation work, the place was 75% empty and remained so while we were there from 1830 to 2000 on a thursday night. wtf?\n\nmy review remains: highly recommended\n\n(sake flight, asahi draft, two white pear martinis, two <mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark>, <mark>Crispy Fried Shrimp</mark>, kobe liver, pork ear, beef tendon, boiled egg, sunomono: $85)", 
            "i would've gone 2 stars but the wifey said to go 3 so there it is. to start we both ended up with stomach aches last night from out meal at raku. not full on, blow out food poisoning but something definitely wasn't right and we both had belly aches. on to the food and review.\n\nas has been mentioned before the service you get at raku is beyond slow and extremely frustrating to deal with. this was at 6:30 and there were only about 15 other people in the place for reference.\n\nfood wise we started with a good but overpriced $12 salad. next was the whole <mark>Crispy Fried Shrimp</mark> which were pretty good but need a dipping sauce in my opinion. moving on we had tried the scallop which was ok but overcooked, we ordered another one later and it was overcooked as well. after that we got the fried pig ear and it was pretty good, different, and still pretty good.\n\nwe tried the kobe beef tendon which is a gelatinous, slightly chewy, oddly flavored piece of matter that we won't be getting again, ever. we had 2 different kinds of kobe skewer. the one with the garlic chips which was good and the other with wasabe which was very good!\n\nnext came the bluefin tuna sashimi special which was excellent! high quality, great flavor and melts in your mouth. then the guy next to us ordered cod sperm, seriously. what the hell, i gave it a shot and i don't know that i'll be rushing back to do so again. it had a creamy texture and tasted mostly of the ponzu sauce i'd dipped it in. it was ok but rather odd and it looked like golf ball sized brains!\n\nall in all we thought it was ok but won't be rushing back. plus 4 draft sapporo beers for 2 people and the bill came to $125.", 
            "there are certain times in life when food takes center stage.\n\nladies, and gents...raku is beyond that.\n\ni popped in on a whim the other night. countless coworkers would tell me about how this was the best restaurant in all of las vegas. i took it for granted, because people always say that about one restaurant or another. i guess i had to experience it for myself.\n\na friend and i stopped in without a reservation last week. it's a small restaurant and each of the tables (but one) was occupied. the dining room is small. it may remind you of the dining scene in san francisco or new york city. the kind of place that begs for your attention through it's subtle exterior.\n\nafter a short wait, we were seated at a nice table.\n\nwe ordered:\n\n-agadashi tofu -- so perfect and so good!\n-house tofu -- also amazing. next time i'd probably get half and half with agadashi.\n-black cod -- better than nobu. this was off the seasonal fish menu.\n-crispy asparagus -- perfectly cooked, crunchy, crispy delicious.\n-<mark>Crispy Fried Shrimp</mark> -- delicious. these are full shrimp. don't get grossed out by the shrimp heads.\n-green tea creme brulee -- the perfect ending to a fantastic meal.\n\nyour table will have some seasonings on it. a green tea salt. a chili powder. a sake chili thing. and soy sauce which is incredible and seasoned with plum. \n\nuse these seasonings. mix and match. they tend to provide a different experience with each mixture.\n\nthis one meal is a top five for me. i'm no stranger to food, and good food at that. this is the spot that is a must try when you are in vegas.\n\ntotal bill for two -- about 60 bucks.\n\nreturn timetable: immediate.",

            "this is my second time here and i love it. i always order their skewers and my favorite is kobe beef skirt with garlic! my allll time favorite doe is their <mark>Crispy Fried Shrimp</mark> and you can that whole with shell, head, and everythang. this time we decided to go with their special which was ishimochi fried with mushrooms. i was kind of disappointed that it was actually white croaker when i saw it. so i basically paid $32 for them to fry me a white croaker that costs $3 at the korean store. but whatever it was good.\n\ni would seriously only recommend purely getting the skewers as your main dishes because they know how to grill their skewers.",

            "three words - live uni udon.  say whaaat??\n\nyeah, you heard me.  raku sacrifices the lives of innocent sea urchin to serve you their deliciously sweet roe mixed with thin udon in a cool dashi (?) broth.  the whole thing is topped off with salmon eggs, green onions and a chiffonade of shiso.  all this is presented from within the still beautiful (but now deceased) sea urchin shell.\n\nother noteworthy dishes:  <mark>Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard</mark> topped with a seared piece of duck breast.  my husband was too tired to eat his so i ended up eating about one and a half before the richness got to me and i had to stop.  \n\ntheir homemade tofu is always a must - you can get it half \"agedashi\" and half served cold.\n\nskewers:  salmon, pork cheek, tendon...drooooool....\n\nif they have it on the specials menu, you must get the <mark>Fried Ice Fish</mark> - deep fried whole tiny fishies. when sprinkled with the lemon wedge and the green tea house salt, it's amazing.  \n\ni tried to get them to sell me their salt (green tea powder, roasted salt and shitake powder is what the waitress told me) but apparently it's proprietary.  poo!  well...that just means we have to keep going back to have more.\n\nsmall place, seats about 35 people, i would, including at the bar.  stays open late so it's perfect for a 2nd dinner! :d", 
            "raku is the type of restaurant that takes you out of vegas and into a corner restaurant in japan.  this is the most authentic japanese cuisine that we've tried, and a nice change from the regular japanese ramen and tempura that i usually love.\n\nfirst, the other yelpers are right--you do need a reservation to eat there, not matter what the day or time.  they are only open for dinner and open till 3am, so call that same day or in advance.  even if one seat is open and you come in without a reservation they may turn you away, so keep that in mind.\n\nwe walked in at 730 this evening and it was a full restaurant.  i assumed that it would be a yakitori restaurant, so i checked the menu and ordered a few things, which i'll go through in a minute.  first, the drinks were limited if you aren't drinking sake or beer.  according to our server, all they had for soda was coke, so my husband had a coke and i had water.  they explained all the specials of the day and their sake specials as well, giving us a few minutes to go through the menu.  \n\ntheir menu isn't large, so it's easy to choose a variety of things to try.  their appetizers are very familiar to me because we went through japan and had some of these things like cow intestines and sea urchin.  the grilled menu is nice and short, but with lots of variety, as is their soup and rice bowl sections.  here's what we ordered:\n\n-<mark>Juicy Deep Fried Chicken</mark> appetizer: very interesting.  they roll a boneless breast up with the skin on and deep fry it till the skin is almost dark brown.  i believe it's marinated slightly in shoyu, so it had good flavor.\n\n-asparagus tempura: it's my favorite thing out of the entire night!  the coating is small squares of potato or something.  it was delicious!!!\n\n-potato is dashi: very good broth.  you can't go wrong with dashi and we ate the potato with a spoon.  very good, and very light.  a wonderful starter.\n\n-kobe with wasabi: extremely tender and not overpowered with any seasoning.  the flavor of the meat is savory and lovely.  i couldn't see the marbling cause it was grilled well done, but very good.  the wasabi gave it that heat, which was a nice combination.\n\n-chicken breast: not on a stick like the kobe but sliced and served with a shoyu sauce.  very tender and very well seasoned.  here's the thing--in japan they serve chicken half done in most yakitori places on the street, so when this came with the chicken having a pink center i didn't mind.  if you're the type to shy away from medium-well chicken, this may not be your dish. \n\n-duck with balsamic: very nicely grilled so that the duck fat was crispy and melt-in-your-mouth good.  the balsamic was a perfect pairing with the green onion.  very good yakitori.\n\n-scallop in butter and miso: very tender, lovely butter flavor and the sauce was excellent.  served on the scallop's half shell, too.\n\n-yellowtail: very good and had the usual sauce on it, too. i love grilled yellowtail so this was nice.  some people think it's sacrilege to do that to yellowtail, but it's really, really good.\n\n-<mark>Fried Ice Fish</mark>: these are small fish, smaller then sardines and they tempura them.  they come in a bowl and it was yummy.  as long as you don't mind eating the little black eyes and tail, you should try it.  i liked it. salty and you can squeeze some lime on there.  \n\n-bite size chicken and egg bowl: it looks gross, to be honest, but the flavors are excellent. the rice with the sauce reminds me of how rice tastes when you mix bulgogi sauce in it.  i liked it.  warning: the egg is placed on the rice raw and then cooked chicken on top with more egg, so it's not fully cooked egg.  it's partially gelatinous still, so if you're weary of that, just a warning.\n\neverything tasted good and i even ordered another round of the asparagus tempura.  i wanted their fluffy cheesecake, but it takes 20 minutes to make, so if you want to try it when you go order it in advance.\n\noverall, it was a nice flashback of japan and a good experience.  would i go back?  probably not.  our tab was 100 bucks and some change, something i can't go spend daily.  for 2 people that was a lot of food, mind you, but still--i don't like paying 2-9 dollars for one skewer or one scallop.  \n\nin terms of service, it's fairly good. they clear you table throughout the whole experience, which is nice.  you need to put your glass out to the outside of the table to get refills of water, but you must ask for refills on coke.  it's by the bottle.  we had to ask for our check once, and when it didn't come we just gave another server our credit card.  other than that, their service during the entire meal is really good.  they even walk you out the door, which i thought was pleasant.\n\nif i want yakitori, i'll go to shisen, but if you want that authentic japanese experience you have to try this place.  it's good, but  the only thing i loved was the asparagus appetizer.  sorry to say, but the rest was just okay for me, but the flavor profiles were really good. \n\ntry it once.", 
            "my husband and i fought over the uni soup, pork cheek, <mark>Fried Ice Fish</mark>,  <mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark>, and... well, almost everything! we're definitely going back next time we're in vegas!", 
            "this isn't your ignorantly assumed fine dining japanese restaurant. its a rustic, classic, unpretentious and for the lack of a better word \"dank\" japanese joint. listen, when you've had japanese food all your life; and you've had it everywhere from nagasaki to osaka, the little corners and cracks in maui and oahu, from your japanese grandmother's table to your mother's and even all the los angeles trend setting chains like nobu, then you can make a legitimate argument to why raku is just all right. maaaaaaaan, it's a fantastic izakaya spot, tucked away in the heart of chinatown, its open until 2:00 am, it caters to industry people, the foodies, locals and newbies. the experience they offer you is simultaneously calm and adventurous. they define umami with their unassuming ohitashi and break barriers on simplicity with their konbu seaweed. i didn't even mention the meat and seafood---pork ear, chicken thigh, <mark>Fried Ice Fish</mark>, kurobuta pork cheek, kobe beef tendon....\nyou can't even compare a nobu to a raku. nobu is japanese with south american (mainly peruvian) influences. its the sh*t, no doubt, but don't be that \"dummie\"---give raku a little more credit.\n\n\n4.5", 
            "a favorite with local vegas chefs and celebrity foodies both for the extended hours (open 'til 3, and as an aside, i was offered a reservation when i called of 1:30, so apparently they aren't kidding around about catering to the kitchens and bars as they close) and the clean, simply adorned flavors.\n\nlong-braised pork belly appetizer with a bit of freshly mixed hot mustard. served in the cooking liquid, and it was heavenly. the fat was barely solid, and melted into a sauce the moment my tongue disturbed it.\n\nskewers, priced from $2 to $16. many less expensive are great, including the very simple asparagus skewer with a very understated, slightly sweet sauce. bacon-wrapped inoki mushrooms are not only filled with umami from the fungus, but also impossibly pretty. kurobuta pork cheek was sweet, lean, and had a deep pork taste. if forced to choose a dish among the regular favorites, that's the one.\n\noden broth with small bites. <mark>Fried Ice Fish</mark> cake and stuffed leaf of napa cabbage.\n\nflights of imported sake and biru, but no drinkers in our group. it appeared that they were doing brisk business on both. very reasonable, $45 nicely fed three of us.", 
            "when you start off knowing that all the major players eat here, you know you're in for a meal of a lifetime. not only does raku serve beautifully executed food, it's a bargain at 10+ courses for only $50pp. the icing on the cake is knowing that you may run into joel robuchon, guy savoy, or even mario batali in his orange crocs. raku is the only place that has managed to \"wow\" me even more on the second visit as compared to the first. and that's not discounting the first meal because that was exquisite in and of itself. however on the second visit, raku was able to re-invent itself and offer even more delectables and a considerably different tasting menu that wowed my palate even more.\n\nthe restaurant is unassuming, located in a strip mall in chinatown. the decor is minimal with two bathrooms with serious personality. the service is unfussy but genuine and you can tell that they take great care in plating and execution without taking it too seriously. the flavors are clean and emphasis is on using only the best ingredients. all of the components of each dish are well thought out and serve a purpose. the results are nothing short of amazing.\n\nmy favorites are as follows:\n*<mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark> - homemade tofu melts in your mouth and the broth is heavenly, literally out of this world!\n*<mark>Juicy Deep Fried Chicken</mark> - amazingly <mark>Juicy Deep Fried Chicken</mark> wrapped in <mark>Juicy Deep Fried Chicken</mark> skin...need i say more...\n*<mark>Crispy Asparagus Okaki</mark> - the crispy fry on the outside of the asparagus adds the perfect crunch and toasted rice flavor to add incredible depth. add some green tea salt to bring out the flavors even more\n*dried tatmi <mark>Dried Tatami Sardine Salad</mark> - ceasar salad kicked up a notch, great briny and cheesy flavor\n*kurobuta pork cheek robata - juicy and great grill flavor from the robata\n*<mark>Fried Ice Fish</mark> - beautifully <mark>Fried Ice Fish</mark> served whole with fish nuggets in again, heavenly broth\n*enoki mushroom wrapped in bacon robata - it's wrapped with bacon...need i say more\n*<mark>Yellowtail Carpaccio</mark> - sashimi was incredibly fresh\n*grape tomatoes robata - so simple but simply delicious...add the green tea salt and you're going to be impressed and want to try to make it at home\n*salmon ikura don - beautifully presented and then served into individual portions. the ikura pops in your mouth to bring the taste of the ocean to the salmon rice.\n*udon noodle with <mark>Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard</mark> soup - the broth as well as the noodles were amazing\n*eel don with gobo - again, served with heavenly broth. the gobo added great depth by bringing a bit of earthy bitterness to balance the salty and sweet.\n*<mark>Crispy Fried Shrimp</mark> - fried little shrimpies, delicious.. \n*sorbet of the season - so simple, a strawberry sorbet with condensed milk. the combination makes the sorbet take on a creamy texture and the fruit flavor packs a good punch to end the meal. the kiwi one was delicious as well \n\n\nthe things i would forgo to save room for the things above:\nchicken thigh robata\nchicken breast wrapped with chicken skin robata\nkobe beef outside skirt with garlic robata\n<mark>Tofu Salad</mark> \"caprese\" with seaweed, tomatoes, and dried fishies", 
            "raku, how do i love thee? let me count the ways:\n\n1. you hold sake tasting event with a buffet for the reasonable price of $45.\n2. you are generous with said items and beer.\n3. you have a friendly staff that can withstand the onslaught of ravenous yelpers.\n4. you are the reason i got to hang out with said yelpers.\n\nthose reasons were enough to clench my love for this place. i got the impression that these events are rare, so keep an eye out for it. definitely attend because a normal dinner can cost way more than $45.\n\nthe buffet line consisted of <mark>Fried Ice Fish</mark> (small anchovy size sea creatures, easily eaten like popcorn.), panko crusted asparagus, grilled asparagus skewers, bacon wrapped asparagus (a whole buffet of asparagus), bacon wrapped enoki mushrooms, grilled cherry tomatoes, mushrooms, garlic beef skewers, chicken thigh skewers, pork belly, pork cheeks, pig ears, sliced kobe beef, a plethora of oden, fried turkey or chicken (the staff kept saying something different), plenty of sashimi, and more. i found that the most basic of items such as the robata style cherry tomatoes and oden were my favorite of the night. the daikon was so tender and absorbed all the wonderful flavors of the soup. the beef tendon were melt in your mouth delicious as well. \n\nif that was not enough, there were more than 10 sakes to try, unlimited asahi and asahi dark. \n\nwith a large portion of their menu under my belt now, i want to try some of their noodle dishes.", 
            "we attended the raku sake tasting event with a buffet for the price of $45.\n\npros\n1.) food:\n     -yellowtail and salmon sashima: very fresh, very good\n     -<mark>Crispy Fried Shrimp</mark> w/head attached:  flavorful\n     -bacon wrapped asparagus:  bacon goes well w/everything...good\n     -deep <mark>Fried Ice Fish</mark>:  nice snack to munch on\n     -raku oden:  i tried the beef tendon, daikon, taro noodles, and this awesome   thing with mochi in the middle...i wanna go back and have me a bowl of this deliciousness.\n     -pork cheek and kobe garlic skewers:  i will definitely come back to eat more of these skewers.\n    -lamb shank lollipop: very tender and juicy\n    -brown sugar pudding in milk, with a raisin:  i liked this very much, i had 4 bite-size servings of this.\n2.) service was great.  the staff were on their toes to clear out all the plates\n3.)there were many varieties of sakes, but my favorite was the riesling.  one small cup of this and i was good.  \n\ncons\n1.) venue:  small and cramped.  there were just so many people here.  \n2.) unorganized:  i had to keep going through the line to get food and there were times when i got to the front to get food, barely anything is there.  \n3.) there were people that didn't want to be civilized and wanted to just go up to the front and grab the food.  tsk tsk.\n\noverall, great event, great food, great times with great yelpers.  i'm a fan", 
            "i heard great things of the sake tasting so decided to come at the lure of unlimited drink and eats for $45. \n\nthere was about 20 sakes to try as well as light/dark asahi. sake isn't a spirit i am well versed in but know enough to see some of these are quality items. i was impressed with some of the smoothness and flavor of some of these and makes me rethink about adding a daiginjo sake into our spirit collection. \n\nthe buffet ranged from-\n\nrobatas: filet w/ garlic, chicken thigh, pork belly, bacon enoki, mushroom, tomato.\noden: 3kinds of fishcake, soybean curd wrapped mochi, beef tendons, chicken meatballs, seaweed, noodles, potato, radish. \napps: asparagus wrapped in panko/nuts, tempura <mark>Fried Ice Fish</mark>, <mark>Juicy Deep Fried Chicken</mark>, roast beef, tofu with tomato, cold tofu, whole <mark>Crispy Fried Shrimp</mark>, chopped seafood with/pickled bonito guts, sashimi w/ ponzu, baby radish to dip in fermented bean paste or mustard.\ndessert: brown sugar custard/jelly in condense milk with a dried goji berry.\n\ni probably missed a few things, but these were recurring items. i can see the quality of the food here definitely. the oden beef tendons are some of the best i've had. the robatas definitely get the special flavor of the binchotan charcoal imparted on them. the tofu has superb texture. \n\nnow the rub of this event- it was disneyland status wait. we waited to pay. we waited for food. no food was up there a few times we went so it was another wait for anything to come out. we waited to get to seat in one of the limited seating areas. the layout makes for intimate dining but is not very good for banquet style as many of the aisles are narrow and tables/areas aren't made for maximum utility. you can come later, but a lot of the food has been already attacked and i don't know how freshly made a ton of it will be. since it's usually pretty pricey to eat here, i probably did get my moneys worth even though i wouldn't say i was neither too drunk or too full by the time we decided to go already. \n\nthe food was good, but i don't know if i was floored by it enough to justify regular pricing. it's probably significantly better when it's not made in larger plates, but some i got straight from the kitchen piping hot. i also think i'm forever disappointed by my izakaya style meals here on out as none can top an epic night at shunju in roppongi for me. \n\nthere are some more gourmet items i'm still dying to try, so i will be back for a regular dining experience to try the more unique offerings and skip the basics this buffet has served.", 
            "it's the bomb.  i went there twice and kept thinking about the food.  i can't wait to go there again.  every time i brought friends there, they were blown out of the water too.  make sure you order out from the board.  their sashimi is to die for.  order the blue fin tuna, it melts in my mouth.  \nthey are always busy though.  expect a wait, unless you make reservation ahead of time.  if you have a party of 5 and more, they make you have the fixed menu, so i always make sure i come in as 4 or less so i can order a la carte.  the lamb does not have any gamy taste.  the skewed chicken is great.  i like the <mark>Fried Ice Fish</mark> that looks like french fries, and taste like if not better than french fries.\nstrongly recomm this restaurant.  don't expect sushi, they even scold you if you ever think about sushi walking into this restaurant.  because they offer something way superior than sushi.", 
            "my husband now calls it his favorite restaurant in vegas!  first off, we have been discussing eating at raku for a long time.  i always send my customers there even though i had never eaten there. the truth i was a little apprehensive. i looked at the menu and i was frightened! i like to think i am adventurous when it comes to food, but alas  i am not!! i had a very bad episode trying uni for the first time. i don't get it. to me it's the worst thing i have ever put in my mouth and i drank a big gulp from a water bottle with cigarette butts in it one time, still not as bad as the uni. so as you can see my taste buds don't agree with some ingredients that people think are so damn great.\n\nanyway, from the beginning to the end our experience was awesome. the service was outstanding!! (yes, this is in china town!!) our server was so helpful, polite and inviting. she really made us feel welcomed. so did the rest of the staff when we walked in. nobody looked at us like who is this afro queen and the white man with her!! i forgot our servers name but i guess she went home because we ended our meal with another server. she was nice as well, but my first girl was over the top great! \n\non to the food, we ordered some sashimi from the daily special. i believe she said they got it in that day, yellowtail from somewhere, sorry don't remember. 35.00 dollars for seven pieces. i am not that into sashimi but i saw my husband's eyes light up (she made it sound so great) so i said get it!! and i am glad we did! it was delicious! we also got some shrimp ball thingies on the special, these were so tasty, we got a second order. i have included a picture of both. my husband is still talking about it and that he can pop those things in his mouth at anytime!! nice texture not over cooked just delicious.\n\nfrom the menu we ordered kobe beef fillet with wasabi, duck with balsamic soy sauce, butter sauteed scallop ,yellowtail with glazed soy based sauce,  enoki mushroom wrapped in bacon, <mark>Fried Ice Fish</mark> and i believe some soup with rice ball. that broth was the least of my favorites. it was nice and clean tasting but just not for me. i think i found it fishy. everything else was so yummy!!  i don't know what was my favorite. everything seemed to melt in my mouth. the <mark>Fried Ice Fish</mark> was good, i didn't love it as much as everything else, but my husband loved it. i will say and he agreed, if you like this eat it while it's hot because once it gets cold it's not so great.\n\nthe atmosphere is one of our favorites, no tvs!! it's cozy and so clean. the bathrooms are awesome make sure you check them both out. my husband was obsessing over the one with rose petals!  we started with a beer and a glass of wine. then we decided to get a bottle to share. i believe it was a pinot grigio and it was really good. our bill was about 158.00 without tip. a lot cheaper than we were expecting. we love love love it there and can't recommend it enough. it's just such a great dining experience!!", 
            "i've been here at least 8 times.  they never failed in making the meals memorable.  keep in mind the plates are vary small, one bite per person.  so be prepared to order a lot.  i love the <mark>Juicy Deep Fried Chicken</mark>, <mark>Fried Ice Fish</mark>, blue fin tuna sashimi , tofu adegashi, mushroom w bacon, scallop in butter sauce, lamb rack, skirt steak.\nif your party has more than 4 people, they will put you in the room in the back and make the omakase meal for $65/pp.  with such exquisite flavor and taste, i think it's worth every penny.\ni always take friends and family there every time they come into town.", 
            "small tiny place that you have to make reservations for way in advance. my mom made a reservation for us 2 weeks in advance, and if you're late..within 15 minutes they will give your table to somebody else. \n\nlocated in a small tiny corner in chinatown. we got there about 10 minutes before our reservation time, but we were assisted to sit down right away. the food itself takes quite a long time to arrive. we were there for almost 2 hours. it took about a good 45 minutes for the first plate to come out. \n\ni actually prefer shin sen gumi yakitori over this place. the taste isn't as strong as theirs. but, overall it's pretty good. \n\npopeye salad $8- spinach and bacon (mainly), decently good. a little too salty, but a good salad nonetheless!\n\n<mark>Crispy Asparagus Okaki</mark> $5- delicious. super crunchy, and it actually tasty cheesy! nom nom. \n\n<mark>Juicy Deep Fried Chicken</mark> $9- not a favorite. didn't have too much flavor to it, and it was strangely chewy. slightly warm as well. \n\n<mark>Fried Ice Fish</mark> $8.50- frowning as i write this. i don't like fish, and i don't like seeing multiple tiny fishes fried up whole. i ate like 3.. d: no gusta.\n\n<mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark> $11- pretty good! i just didn't like the fish eggs inside, but overall it was a good and flavored dish!\n\nmomo chicken thigh $2.75 each- err, it was a little too pink for my liking, and it was kind of fatty. it was okay \n\ntsukune $3.50 each- shin sen's is much tastier. this one comes as like a drumstick, and i had to keep adding more togarashi. not enough sauce. \n\nharami kobe beef skirt $7.50 each- delicious! comes with grunchy garlic chips. mmm, super tasty!\n\nyakionigiri $5.00 (comes with 2)- it was..okay. lol\n\nscallop with soy sauce $7.00- not sure how this tasted. didn't eat this one!\n\nasparagus with bacon $3.00- comes with 3 pieces, pretty good. \n\nasahi $7.00\n\numeshu $12.00 (super delicious!)\n\noverall, the flavor was almost there, and i didn't think it was the greatest.", 
            "in town for a bachelor party and the bachelor and his brother are both chefs so i knew when they set up a reservation at this place that it was upon good research and recommendation. \n\nwe received 7 courses in total, each better than the last. as we waited for dinner to begin we enjoyed sake as well as the ambience. the bathrooms in raku where really breathtaking. unfortunately just before dinner they were both occupied and my friend was forced to quietly vomit in a private corner.  very accommodating, indeed. \n\nfirst up was a tofu dish. i don't typically enjoy tofu but this was different. it was a soft tofu that was perfectly seasoned, and the condiments were perfectly paired. in fact, perfect condiments were the theme of dinner. such a seemingly small detail but when done right it goes a long way! all at the table enjoyed the tofu with the exception of my friend who had been busy eradicating his upper gi tract of any free radicals since we sat down. he excused himself to the bathroom to seek solitude in the cool grass floor covering and  the warm heated toilet. \n\nnext out was the fish. i'm not well versed in fish so i won't attempt to rehash all the sashimi that we enjoyed but it was all well cut, presented, and of course delicious. once again the condiments were perfect. the pickled ginger was a fresh take on ginger for me.  at this point the sake was really flowing and our friend returned. i fed him a piece of tuna and he found it so tasty his body immediately began telling him he should make room for more, so after ordering him a ginger ale we excused him to step outside and take some air.\n\nthe lamb chops- my goodness. i don't think i've ever had them so succulent before! fortunately for us our friend was still enjoying the night air, so we had one to spare. as we speculated wether or not our friend would quietly disappear into a taxi cab outside we divided his chop and all the meat quickly disappeared. against all odds our friend returned and next up was the whole fried flying fish. \n\nthe meat of the flying fish was wonderful, but i was feeling bold and went after the fish skeleton. whole <mark>Fried Ice Fish</mark> skeleton is delightfully crunchy and the cheek of the head is arguably the best part of the fish. we quickly layer waste to two entire fish and when the frenzy was over only the fins remained. i hope i have a chance to enjoy flying fish again'\n\nnext came the beef. when our friend saw the kobe beef yakatori with wasabi on top he was so excited he couldn't stop himself from evacuating his stomach right there at the table. we'd later take advantage of an extra foie gras courtesy of our friend. it turns out that when you're slouched over in your chair with your forehead against the cool wallpapered wall of a restaurant and slyly booting on the floor next to your chair, it makes you think about life, it makes you feel generous and you share more food with your friends. \n\nas dinner wound down and we finished all the sake, our friend finally turned the corner and was able to eat some <mark>Juicy Deep Fried Chicken</mark>. we enjoyed the company of our waitress and the family atmosphere. we enjoyed a few more dishes but i'll leave the reader to explore the menu on their own. you really must go to raku!  food was a+, restaurant was beautiful, and the staff was private and polite! cheers!", 
            "my boyfriend discovered raku while researching the top restaurants in las vegas. we were able to score a (late) reservation for 6 on a saturday night at 12am. we were told that groups of more than 5 are required to select the omakase menu for $75 per person. \n\ni was expecting to be blown away by the food here after reading numerous reviews of the restaurant. the verdict? the food was definitely over-hyped. we had a good meal but nothing really stood out. \n\nwe started with a tofu appetizer where the star of the dish was the green tea salt (which you can purchase here). other courses included a whole <mark>Fried Ice Fish</mark> in broth, various charcoal bbq skewers, soup, and assorted sashimi. all of the ingredients were high-quality but nothing really blew me away. \n\nwhen it came time for dessert, all we got was some fruit sorbet. i'm sorry but for $75 per person, i would have expected something better (green tea creme brulee, anyone?). overall, i might consider coming back and ordering a la carte items from the menu as i saw some interesting offerings. my advice -- steer clear of the omakase menu.", 
            "we came back from having visited a year previous.  this time we came as a party of eight (8).  the staff responded well to the challenge of having 2 diners arriving slightly tardy.  we had the 75$-level omakase.  this afforded us a stunning parade of 10 dishes, including (but not in exact order):\n\n- house-made tofu (raved over even by a noisy meatatarian)\n- sashimi - very fresh, very thin, very cleansing to the palate\n- ankimo (the only dish passed over by our dining entourage... if the server had not referred to it as monk fish liver as well as ankimo, he never would have known and would have enjoyed it)\n- popeye salad (this was a requested item from when we were making the reservations).  this is one of the best applications of spinach (bacon-y goodness at the bottom) that we really wanted to reprise last year's visit.\n- scallop, served with shell.  delicate, perfectly prepared\n- yakitori cherry tomatoes\n- kobe beef yakitori with a stripe of wasabi -- and yes, they proudly showed us their kobe beef importation license (at least, they did last year), so it wasn't \"american kobe,\" a/k/a wagyu\n- a miniature negitoro don (betty's favorite).  she kept saying it was a \"simple\" dish, but i think that the amount of work in dicing and seasoning this preparation perfectly makes it much more than simple.  simple concept, expert complex execution\n- yakitori pork cheek\n- <mark>Fried Ice Fish</mark> (i think, this part of the notes was smudged)\n\nall this followed by a pear sorbet w/condensed milk at the bottom of the bowl.\n\nwe had to show off the main rest room to the folks we dragged along who had never been before -- complete with fish tank.  it's not only clean, but visually stunning.  \n\nas charlie (the noisy meatatarian and erstwhile foodie) says (and we all agree), \"they respect the star product, doing just enough to enhance your enjoyment of it, never overpowering it.\"\n\nthanks raku folks -- another wonderful visit.", 
            "the best japanese meal i've ever had. we did the $75 omakase meal that came with about seven courses. pork cheeks, sashimi ocean trout, chrysanthemum pickled, whole <mark>Fried Ice Fish</mark>, roasted green tea, blue fun tuna, and home made tofu. incredible!", 
            "a bunch of friends on a weekend trip to vegas. we couldn't pass up checking out raku. we've heard that this place tends to be packed, so for our party of 16, we were able to snag reservations for 9 pm. yeah, it was pretty late, but with our huge party, options were limited. i'd recommend making reservations waaaay in advance. \n\nthe majority of us ended up getting the omakase. just one friend requested a gluten free/sugar free option (keto), which they were willing to accommodate. \n\njust a few of the items we sampled were: \n- housemade tofu\n- mixed sashimi platter \n- enochi mushroom wrapped in bacon\n- grilled tomato skewers\n- tsukune-grilled ground chicken\n- a whole <mark>Fried Ice Fish</mark>\n- kobe beef skirt with fried garlic slices\n- tea\n- watermelon ice\n\neach dish was presented beautifully. everything tasted delicious. truly japanese food well served. towards the end of the menu, i was pretty stuffed. \n\nflexible cooking options for folks on diet restrictions like gluten free, keto or paleo. just ask. in some instances, my friend who was doing keto ended up with better food choices. so jelly.\n\ni do plan on coming here, again. next time around i want to try their regular menu. i saw a few things that caught my eye and makes me want to go back. nom.", 
            "raku is hands down one of the best japanese restaurants i've been to in the us. i've been to raku for about three times now and i make it a point to order different items from the menu each time. for me, their most stellar items on the menu are the <mark>Ken Salad</mark>, the foie gras chawan mushi (<mark>Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard</mark>), and the wagyu sukiyaki (on special menu). their grill items were also consistently very good. my friends and i also loved the buttered saut\\u00e9ed hotate (scallops) and the <mark>Fried Ice Fish</mark>, but those are items you can easily find at other gourmet japanese restaurant so if you have to plan your meal, i would go for the <mark>Ken Salad</mark>, the chawan mushi, 2-3 grilled items (we loved the kurobuta pork cheek), and the sukiyaki ($40-50). be prepared to spend upwards of $50 per person.\n\nthe not so nice thing about raku is their service. they are courteous but not attentive. we had to try and catch the servers' attention several times before being approached. they also didn't run us through their special menu until after i asked if they were still serving their wagyu sukiyaki. getting a reservation at this place is an absolute nightmare. the receptionist is fond of saying sorry no and does not offer any options (ie. no suggestions of other vacant times nor information on tables that are reserved for walk ins). on one occasion, we arrived 5 minutes late and after making us wait almost 10 mins, the receptionist then told us they couldn't sit us because the next table reservation was in 20mins. mind you, that was at 6pm, and 2/3rd of the place was still empty. if you want a table at raku, better call and reserve at least 3-4 days in advance. a vegas trip simply isn't complete without a visit to this appetite fulfilling place !",

            "wow...what a place.  it's tiny, interesting looking interior-wise with chocolate walls and low lighting that make everyone look good.  walls are lined with banquettes -- and tables in the middle can be pushed together for large groups -- but remember, this place is tiny, and the tables don't turn quickly at all.  we were there for two and a half hours and only 1 table left.  the only \"leaving\" is when folks head outside to smoke.\n\nwhat i loved was that my husband had taken a group here a few weeks ago (brett below) was with him...and they had a monumental meal that made him feel guilty he'd not taken me first so we went last night and i thought it was spectacular with one lapse in service and food to knock one star off 5, but it was still dynamite.  \n\nthey were out of unfiltered sake which made him pout, but our server made an excellent recommendation on a bottle that we loved -- only problem was it went down too easily, and since they were low, wouldn't sell us a second...mid meal....\n\nstarted with skewered cherry tomatoes -- lightly salted that were still amazingly cool in the center.  we both could have eaten a pound of these.  we had a japanese version of caprese salad that blew my mind <mark>Sunomono - Cucumber And Seaweed</mark> for basil, sliced tomatoes, the creamiest tofu ever for mozzarella and for interest on top - and to take it so over the top that i was in awe -- teeny tiny baby eels that were fried to crispy sprinkled lightly on top.  he sprinkled green tea salt on the top and i was blown away.  \n\nthe <mark>Sashimi Salad</mark> with tuna and salmon, spinach and dressing of soy, yuzu and crispy shallots was to die for on such a hot night.\n\nthen we had fried octopus -- wow.  flavors that exploded in your mouth -- really satisfying and so simple.\n\nwhole <mark>Crispy Fried Shrimp</mark> were great and made for great comedy at the table -- a la bean on vacance in france a la gare...  if you saw the movie, you'll get the reference since you eat these whole -- we liked them much more than bean did. \n\nthis was where things fell apart -- where we'd had food coming out -- small plates -- timed perfectly...suddenly the brakes hit hard and the whole restaurant came to a standstill.  i jokingly said mused that the chef left to buy cigarettes...because seriously nothing came out of the kitchen for about 30 minutes.  \n\nthen magically, things slowly began to fire again...next we had foie gras skewers, terrific baby lamb chops and some raku seaweed and turnips, then some lovely chicken thighs, then a special dashi broth with snapper, shitake mushrooms, japanese eggplant and a lovely okra...then out came two of my favorites -- a chawanmushi with duck and foie gras and dashi broth -- yowza...absolutely mind blowing.  the flavor combination was amazing -- the smokey duck, the sweetness of the dashi, the creaminess of the cusard, the richness of the foie...just terrific...then skewers  of shishito peppers  -- if you've never had these and you like green chilis these rock.   \n\nthen we had one final dish that interestingly was my least favorite -- ground chicken on chopsticks that looked like corndogs but had oddly very little flavor...  or maybe i'd hit the wall...either way, we were officially maxed out -- the bill -- huge -- $240 before tip -- but that was with $100 in sake alone -- and the plates while numerous, were very very tiny...\n\nbut we loved it and i highly recommend checking it out... in true izakaya fashion this place is open late.  go with friends to taste and try everything -- order pitchers of beer, sake, have fun.  it's a great addition to town.",

            "raku is a young restaurant, only two years old, but is quickly becoming popular because the food is exquisite and incredibly sophisticated, and the prices are absolutely reasonable.\n\nbefore i continue i'd like to give you an idea of how desirable this tiny restaurant is becoming. we walked in at 6:20, less than a half hour after they opened for service. we didn't have a reservation, but were lucky to get two seats at the five person bar that looks into the kitchen (this may have been a 'bad' seat to some, but i couldn't imagine a better one). not more than ten minutes after we sat down a guy walked in and asked the following questions (remember this is monday). q: 'do you serve alcohol?' a: just beer and wine; q: do you have sushi? a: no sir. q: can we get a table? a: for how many? eight people he responded. a: uh, no(sweetly, but without a hint of hesitation). the fact that he thought he could get a table for eight seemed utterly preposterous, and actually was. plus, he obviously thought this was sushi roku in caesar's, a common confusion amongst tourists. as we left at around eight o'clock, we overheard another gentleman. q: table for two? r: not until 10 pm. bottom line: make a reservation!\n\nnow for the food. i can best describe the dishes at raku as 'japanese tapas.' most of the items are done in individual portions on a robata grill (see description on blog)) or are enough for each person to have a couple of bites, more or less. we ordered the <mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark> (home-made deep-fried tofu in dashi broth), <mark>Sashimi Salad</mark> (they don't have sushi, yet sashimi is quite prevalent), bacon wrapped enoki mushrooms, kurobuta pork cheek, and steamed clams. when you order you're not sure what dish will come out when, but you can guarantee it won't come out quickly and you won't care once you try it. the <mark>Sashimi Salad</mark> ($9) came first tonight, and was the perfect start to the meal. it consisted of ridiculously fresh salmon, toro (tuna), and yellowtail (hamachi) on a bed of baby spinach, topped off with crunchy fried onions. the dressing consisted of three unique sauces that converge at the bottom of the bowl by the time you finish, enhanced by a swipe of a creamy and spicy fourth sauce on the side of the bowl. it's really hard to describe it without using the words 'oh my god.' then we had the <mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark> ($9), another dish best described with the words 'oh my god.' the different elements that make up this dish clearly exemplify the talents of the chef/owner, abriya raku. first of all, the tofu is made in house, and will make you think differently of tofu ever after. you can see how it might be easy to be a vegetarian if you could eat this on a regular basis. the dashi broth is sweet with intense flavor, and the mini accoutrement such as the baby mushroom heads (a variety i can't identify) floating on the surface, and the beads of salmon roe just pop in your mouth providing complimentary bursts of goodness. next we moved onto our bacon wrapped enoki mushrooms ($2.50) and kurobuta pork cheek ($2.50), both cooked on the robata grill. somehow this grill imparts an indescribable flavor into the food, even though the marking from it is subtle. my husband described it best: \"you could put s*** on that grill and it would come out tasting great.\" you'll be happy to know s*** isn't on the menu of interesting items like beef gut soup, but i think he's right. we finished with the steamed clams ($12), a special for the evening, which were the least impressive dish of the night. the broth was gentle in flavor without being dull, and the dish definitely showcased the clams themselves. the problem, however, is that manila clams aren't that exciting on their own and kind of need a powerful sauce to make them better (i.e the clams at cafe chloe or panna thai). this was the only dish we probably wouldn't order again, not because it was bad, but because so many other items shouldn't be passed up.\n\nthe last thing i would like to talk about are the condiments on the table. most dishes don't require them, but i think you should still try them to broaden your horizons. the soy sauce (bottle at back right) is a unique blend of five different imported kinds and will make you re-think soy sauce the way the tofu made you re-think tofu. the bottle in front of that is a chili sprinkle to add a little heat if you like, and to the left of that is special salt based on the sun-dried sea salt made in the classic shiota style. behind that is aged vinegar with peppers. each of them is constructed with care and love, and if there is that much effort spent on the condiments, it is only obvious that every other dish on the menu will be prepared with the same level of passion and expertise. if there is only one restaurant i've recommended that you must try, this is it.", 
            "not your typical japanese restaurant.  this is a very authentic joint and you won't find california rolls and caterpiller rolls.  we've been there twice in 3 months and both times were great. \n\nlike most folks i highly recommend home made tofu in hot broth. my personal favorite is <mark>Sashimi Salad</mark>.  other great items include sweet corn with stuffed potato, bacon wrapped asparagus, kobe beef with wasabi, and chicken skewers wrapped in skin.  custard with fois gras was awesome.  the prices are reasonable and portions are small.  \n\nwe had a couple of special entrees but i was not impressed.  we had grilled eel from japan cooked two different ways (sweet sauce/salt and pepper). the dish was good but not great.  if it was $15-16 range i'd say it's worth it. it's not worth $30. i didn't like pigs ears either.  perhaps its an acquired taste.  \n\noden was good but nothing special. also try his soy sauce.  it's home made by the chef. it's the bomb!\n\ni also recommend sake samplers but unfortunately they decide which ones.  they tell you ahead of time so you can decide whether to go for it or not.  it usually include one or two from their regular section plus one from their premium section.   if you know what you want, then go with your personal favorite. \n\nfor dessert i had sweet sake and that was great. it's very sweet so be warned. it's not for everyone.", 
            "awesome restaurant. it has a nice ambiance with a homey feel from the cozy size of the place. the food is amazing and so is the service. ive been here twice so far and both times have been an experience to remember. must try their <mark>Sashimi Salad</mark>! the sushi quality is unreal. the salmon literally melts in your mouth! im planning on trying to come here for the <mark>Sashimi Salad</mark> at least once a week. so far, so good.\n\nps: i think it's better than sen of japan overall. :).", 
            "me, my wife and her best friend went to this place after watching pen and teller show at rio hotel. it was about 11 pm . there are 1 of 2 japanese restaurant closes at 3 am in the morning. and they are all located in chinatown. this place is alittle hard to find at night. \n\nwe loved the <mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark>, lamb chop, <mark>Sashimi Salad</mark>, and the mackerel. there was more.  the tofu was fresh and the shashimi was fresh too.", 
            "yes, this place rocks! you'll need reservations bc last night i saw the receptionist turning away many hungry souls. \n\nthe food was totally awesome, we started with the <mark>Sashimi Salad</mark>, home made tofu mix prepared hot and cold, chicken wing, kobe beef fillet with wasabi, lamb chop, grilled duck with balsamic soy sauce, and ended our meal with fish cake in hot broth. \n\nraku has a large selection of saki and imported asahi which i enjoyed with my meal. \n\nthere's so many items to choose from here and there's a chalkboard with daily specialized items. \n\nour waitress was super friendly and knowledgeable with the menu and description of the daily specials. the entire staff was very attentive. \n\ndon't miss out on this great restaurant when visiting las vegas you won't be disappointed.", 
            "i eat a lot of japanese food and have to say this is one of the best.  everything we had was awesome with some of the most amazing dishes being the house made cold tofu, <mark>Sashimi Salad</mark>, grill foie gras, foie gras bowl, yellowtail carpa, , grilled eggplant and green tea soba.  the quality of the ingredients is top notch.  i think this will be a must visit on every vegas trip.", 
            "the food here is beautiful, the atmosphere is wonderful,  and they have fish tanks embedded in the walls! this is not your typical japanese restaurant. \n\nwe started with the monthly sake sampler which was a treat for me because normally i just order the cheap hot sake offered at most japanese and sushi restaurants. this was a delicious start to our meal! \n\nwe then ordered: \n-<mark>Sashimi Salad</mark> (i absolutely loved this... my favorite dish all night)\n-raku's tofu (the first authentic house made tofu i've ever tried, don't expect a lot of flavor but they do have some accompaniment sauces)\n-fried homemade tofu in hot broth (<mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark>, i preferred this over the cold raku tofu)\n-kurobuta pork cheek (mind blowing! a must-try)\n-chicken thigh (eh, this was so-so)\n-grilled duck with balsamic soy sauce (delicious!)\n-asparagus wrapped with bacon (very good, but not much different than you'd have anywhere else)\n-kobe beef outside skirt with garlic (very enjoyable)\n-<mark>Poached Egg</mark> with sea urchin and salmon roe (this was the experimental dish my boyfriend urged us to order and try. definitely some interesting flavors! i'll be honest and say i don't find myself craving it :p )\n\nyou can view all of their dishes on their menu online which i find great for remembering what you ordered when you go back to review. www.raku-grill.com", 
            "sono resutoran wa totemo riipa desu ne? \n\nit's a small space in an otherwise unassuming shopping center with several other restaurants, including a korean bbq and monta noodle house. walking in, it's a relaxing space with lots of warm colored, glossy wood tables and intimate lighting. the decor is much nicer than you would anticipate from the surrounding neighborhood. they've recently received a bit of media praise and when we went there was only bar seating available despite it being after 1 am. our party of 2 had no problem with that and were seated by a cute waitress. it being the night before halloween, they were all in costume! fun! plus, everyone was speaking real japanese back and forth, from the waitress to the kitchen staff, not just pretending. \n\nwe were told we only had a half hour or so to order, so we gave the menu a run down and got to it. we started with a 10 oz bottle of cold sake. our waitress suggested that we try junmai ginjo 'dewazakura oka', a cherryblossom scented sake with a clean, smooth floral flavor and slight hints of fruit. i also ordered a green tea, which was forgotten, but i'll forgive them since it was packed and she may have thought i just changed my mind when we got the sake. our bottle was $18 and was enough for the two of us to share over our meal without becoming perilously incapacitated. because sake is a sobriety ninja like that, it'll slap you silly when you don't expect it to if you're not careful!\n\nthe food:\n- uni in seaweed soup: the uni was sublimely sweet and creamy with a warm exterior from the rich dashi-type broth. it was presented in an adorable wooden bowl with the uni nestled among the seaweed like eggs in a nest. the seaweed was well prepared, with a firm texture and bite. i hate slimy seaweed and this was definitely well prepared quality wakame.  - $4\n- <mark>Sashimi Salad</mark>: 3 types of sashimi on tender baby spinach leaves with a savory/sweet dressing, crisped shallots or bonito & a smear of a spicy paste on the side that could be mixed into the salad. it was light and refreshing, with sweet pieces of fish. when served, the waitress told us which pieces were what, a nice attention to detail that i appreciate. high spinach to fish ratio, but it's $9 and it was the largest dish we were served.\n- kobe beef filet with wasabi: j's favorite, for sure. i really enjoyed this! the piece was roughly 4\" long and 1/2\"x1\" on a skewer with a thin line of wasabi along top. the meat was perfectly cooked and melted as i bit into it. i would go back for this item alone. at $9.50 for a relatively small portion of meat, it's not exactly budget dining, but it's a lovely option to have and still much more affordable than any of the premier steak houses.\n- kobe beef skirt with garlic: also fabulous, though it's hard to say if i liked this or the wasabi one better. this had a different grain and so a different overall mouth feel, but still melted apart as i bit into it. the flavor was great, clean, quality beef with crispy pieces of garlic in a row along the top. at $6 it's a little more affordable than the filet, and i can see ordering many rounds of this item with some friends.\n- asparagus with bacon: 3 asparagus tips wrapped in small pieces of bacon and grilled. it's a simple idea and presented in a small portion. the asparagus still had a crisp bite and the bacon added a nice smoky flavor, but i don't know if i'd want to order this again. $2.50 for 3 bite size pieces of asparagus is a bit much for me. \n- house tofu, 1/2 hot & 1/2 cold: the cold tofu came out first. it had a consistency like mascarpone or creamy cheese, with a very cooling sensation in the body. it was served with lots of thin, flaky bonito, green onions and grated ginger as well as a small offering of sauces/salt that wait on the table. i enjoyed this dish a lot but the boy didn't. definitely a different beast than the cubes of tofu you can buy in most grocery stores. i topped it with all the plated options and a drizzle of the umeboshi spiked soy sauce. yuuuuum!\nthe hot tofu was fried, giving it an interesting textured skin and a creamy interior. the broth it came in was dark, with a rich mix of flavors. orbs of ikura floating on top with a few baby mushrooms in the broth provided great textural interest, especially the briny bursts of flavor the ikura provided in contrast with the creamy tofu interior. i like it better than many of the <mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark> i've had elsewhere and it stands unique from it's peers. $10 for the two tofu dishes, but it was a lot of tofu! this was easily the second largest order we recieved.\n- kurobuta pork cheek: skewered bits of crispy fatty meat. it has a different texture than some would probably like- with a texture that's an cross between gizzard [crunchy yet chewy, gristly, fatty] and bacon. it didn't taste greasy or heavy, and was recommended by our waitress. i liked it but it won't be the first thing i have to order upon returning. $2.50", 
            "raku never disappoints. the quality of food and service surpasses any japanese restaurant in vegas. venturing off the strip and the wait is worth it! there's no words to describe how great the menu is with genius offerings like potato inside a grilled corn. \n\nfavorites: grilled rice ball, <mark>Sashimi Salad</mark>, potato w/ corn, portabella mushroom, desserts!", 
            "i'm stoked that my 100th review will be for such a great restaurant!\n\ni have been wanting to try raku ever since i heard about it. the first couple times we tried to go, we called that day and they were booked until way past my bedtime. so we decided to plan ahead and made reservations a couple of weeks in advance. i wanted to make sure and try the best items so when we made our reservations, i requested the $75 omakase dinner. \n\nfor our first course we had the <mark>Sashimi Salad</mark>. this was one of my favorites of the night. it came with 2 dressings, one spicy and one sweet. the fish was high quality. the crisp onions on top provided a nice flavor and textural contrast. it was a lovely way to start our meal.\n\nnext we were served raku's tofu. they make their own tofu and it comes with bonito, green onion, and ginger. the waitress suggested using the green tea salt and soy sauce to season it as well. the soy sauce is homemade and has a slightly sweet flavor. the tofu had a creamy, smooth texture. i never imagined imagined eating plain tofu and liking it, but i did.\n\nfor our third course we had <mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark> which was deep fried tofu in a miso broth topped with salmon roe. it was exceptional. this was another of my favorites of the night. i don't know how they make tofu so delicious!\n\nnext up was grilled tomatoes. they had a nice charcoal grill flavor.\n\ncourse 5 was <mark>Juicy Deep Fried Chicken</mark>. it was served on a bed of spinach and had awesome crispy skin with sesame. it was indeed juicy and very tasty.\n\nwe then had asparagus with bacon. it consisted of 3 small spears of asparagus wrapped in bacon. the bacon had a nice smoky grilled flavor.\n\nour seventh course was butter sauteed scallop with soy sauce. the scallop was nicely cooked and the sweet soy sauce complemented the dish nicely. this was in my wife's top three dishes.\n\nour next dish was yellowtail with glazed soy-based sauce. it was served with minced radish. the radish made the dish go from good to great. it was a perfect pairing.\n\nnext up was chicken wrapped with skin. it was salty and was a great contrast to the previous slightly sweet courses. the skin was sinfully good.\n\nwe then were served kurobuta pork cheek. it was chewy and reminded me of steak fat. that might not sound appetizing, but it was really good.\n\nfor our 11th course we had kobe beef outside skirt with garlic. my wife loved how the garlic chips complemented by the beef. i liked it too, but by this time i was getting full.\n\nnext was another of my favorites, <mark>Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard</mark>. the custard was beautifully cooked. it was served in a delicious broth. though i was getting full by now, i couldn't stop eating it.\n\nafter that we were served tsukune grilled ground chicken. it looked like a chicken sausage. i was stuffed so i only ate a bite and took the rest home.\n\nwe then were given grilled rice balls. one was flavored with soy sauce and the other with miso. i only had a bite and packed the rest.\n\nlastly, we were given two desserts. first up was green tea creme br\\u00fbl\\u00e9e. the green tea ice cream was subtly flavored and just slightly sweet. it was a nice balance to creme br\\u00fbl\\u00e9e.\n\nour other dessert was cheesecake. it had raspberries hidden inside. i love raspberries, and when i ate the raspberry sitting on top of the cheesecake i exclaimed, \"that's a nice raspberry!\"  the cheesecake was fluffy and airy. it was served with a delicious raspberry sauce and green tea salt.\n\nplaying in the background was japanese elevator music, including a rendition of michael jackson's \"beat it\" which was pretty neat.\n\nthe bathroom has artificial grass on the floor, a fake tree growing up the wall, foliage on the ceiling, birds playing in the background, and flower petals on the floor. a must see!\n\nthe meal was definitely delicious, but i think we should have gone with a $50 omakase meal as there were about five too many courses. i well definitely go back! can't wait to try my favorites again and sample some new dishes!", 
            "what an experience! i'm really glad that i happened to read the \"quick tips\"  for this restaurant before and called ahead to make a reservation. too bad it was on our way there and for 12:00am for the first available but we ventured off to the palms for gambling and drinks. we tried many tapas plates that night but the ones that i remember were the <mark>Sashimi Salad</mark> (the best i've had yet), kobe beef outside skirt with garlic (just eh), foie gras with glazed soy-base sauce (great taste), asparagus with bacon (skip this) and miso soup. a plate is about $5 to $7 and small in size but if you are with other i'd suggest ordering several to taste many dishes. lastly, the bathroom is pretty cool.", 
            "i haven't always appreciated japanese food.  my native cuisine, vietnamese, undoubtedly shares some common ingredients with japanese but the philosophies of the two are quite different from one another.  vietnamese cuisine prioritizes the boldness of flavors whereas japanese cuisine respects the quality of ingredients.  either way, it took me some time to fall in love with the latter.\n\nnow that japanese food is such a favorite lover, it's difficult to only settle for mediocre encounters.  so i'm thankful to have had a rendezvous with raku one friday evening, since the exquisite tastes of that rendezvous have left me wanting more.  \n\ni couldn't help but think of the restaurant's decor in terms of a woman, who is stunningly beautiful but dressed in a sophisticated manner.  the restraint in sultriness also resonates in the food, presented like a thakoon silk gown draped across the body of thandie newton (for those who cannot extract a vision, google the gorgeous actress).  \n\nbeyond the presentation, the food tastes of superior quality that combined opposites of flavors.  grilled duck with balsamic soy sauce was buttery but clean.  <mark>Sashimi Salad</mark> had spinach and fresh fish that were fresh, crunchy, tender, and savory.  cold tofu and hot tofu were rich but airy, and melted in your mouth like pudding.\n\nfor some time, my foodie friends have been making fun of me for not having the raku flavors in my taste dictionary and now i agree with them about the pilgrimage that foodies have to make to raku.", 
            "raku continues to impress each and every time.  i took my fianc\\u00e9 for his birthday and chose the secret menu option of omakase.  okay, okay, it's not really secret, but i love calling unlisted menu options \"secret\".  i like pretend that i'm part of a secret foodie society of delicious food.  my first visit a couple years back was perfect.  this last visit just solidified how amazing raku can be in terms of the consistency and quality of its food.  it also helps that the service is always very efficient and friendly.\n\nfor omakase, there are three tiers to choose from $50/$75/$125.  being that it was it was for his birthday, i decided to go middle baller style - $75!\n\n1.  saba/mackerel sashimi - mackerel doesn't have the same reputation of its fatty counterpart of oh toro, but leave it to raku to take it up to to the highest notch of freshness.  just a tiny dab of wasabi and the tiniest dab of their house made soy sauce was the perfect combination of flavor.\n2.  <mark>Sashimi Salad</mark> with baby spinach, salmon, yellowtail - the best <mark>Sashimi Salad</mark> ever because the fish was perfectly fresh, the spinach perfectly crisp, the soy sauce dressing combined with deep fried onions (?) was texturally and flavor wise on point!\n3.  house tofu (chilled) with side of bonito flakes - we had this with a little bit of green tea infused salt.  this was our least favorite of the night because we usually like our tofu with sauce, so it was a little dry for our tastes.  however, for a purist tofu lover, this is probably a good dish to have this was pure soy goodness.\n4.  clams - these were simply cooked in a clay pot.  they were a bit on the salty side, but i definitely enjoyed the seafood enfused essence of the clam broth.\n5.  unagi salted and unagi with light glaze of kabayaki sauce - raku has introduced me to the true form of unagi.  i think that i've been eating poor representations of unagi slathered in way too much kabayaki sauce, but this time i know i had the real thing!  the dish consisted of delicately grilled fresh water eel, one side lightly salted, one side lightly glazed in kabayaki sauce.  fantastic.\n6. charcoal grill items (mushroom skewers, <mark>Juicy Deep Fried Chicken</mark> skewers, pork cheek skewers, kobe beef skewers) - premium ingredients with smoky flavors and not an ounce of dryness or chewiness!\n7. <mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark> - this is our favorite at raku, and it did not disappoint.  it is their house made tofu deep fried and presented in their broth.\n8. raspberry sorbet - i'm usually not a fruity flavor dessert kind of gal unless it's fresh cut fruit, so i definitely did not enjoy this to the fullest.  the sorbet was more icy than smooth, but definitely had some intense raspberry flavor.\n\nconclusion:  raku chews up other japanese restaurants and spits them out kindly, politely and with flourish.  they win hands down.",

            "i love their <mark>Sashimi Salad</mark> and pork cheeks.  they also have this green tea/salt that you can put on your skewers if you like, but you don't really need to as most things are seasoned well.\n\nscallops are my favorite and they have it nicely cooked and seasoned.  although we tried drinking the broth and it was salty but i'm not sure if you were meant to drink it or not.  \n\nthe servers were nice it does take a little time to get your food, but it's nice enviroment...meant for a slower pace dinner.  i recommend making a reservation or else you might not be seated depending on the time and day.  \n\nthey make their tofu fresh daily :) \n\nwe tried two desserts and i can't decide which one i like better...but they have cheesecake and chocolate cake.  portions are on the small end, but full of rich favor.  although the chocolate cake and green tea ice cream gets some getting used to but after a couple of bites i liked it :)",

            "finally had the opportunity to bust my raku cherry with three friends visiting from out of town, and when you have a group of folks walk in with no appetite from a heavy late lunch and still managed to complete a meal with their taste buds completely blown away, it is clearly a sign of just pure amazing food.  we had a taste of a few items from each section (appetizers, robata grill, and noodles/rice/soups), and can hardly wait to return for more.  i was so inspired that i composed a raku haiku for each of our selections:\n\n\"<mark>Sashimi Salad</mark>\"\nfresh slice of the sea\ndeep-fried onions paired with greens\nperfect start to meal\n\n\"<mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark>\"\nhouse made soybean dream\namazing broth, chili, roe\nten dollars well spent\n\n\"apple marinated lamb chop\"\nsucculent two chops\naromatically juicy\nno shame to gnaw bone\n\n\"soboro don- seasoned ground chicken\"\nquail yolk atop rice\nmix ingredients and share\ncomfort food at its best\n\n\"grilled rice ball\"\ntwo nuggets of art\nfragrant mint countervailed with crunch\ncomplements all meats\n\n\"asparagus\"\ncrispy rice coating\nperfect balance in texture\nveggie laced with crack\n\n\"kobe beef skirt steak\"\nribeye pales to you\nwhere have you been all my life?\nmelt in your mouth joy\n\n\"pork cheek\"\nbacon's lost cousin\ni feel guilty eating this...\nyet i cannot stop", 
            "thank you, raku, for such a delightful dinner, though it would probably be more suitable to describe it as a wonderful experience. everything from your great service to dish presentation to flavor was impeccable.  \n\nthe meal started with a wonderful <mark>Sashimi Salad</mark>.  the sashimi pieces were big and the dressing was uniquely good.  then came the homemade tofu, which had great texture and the homemade soy sauce and sauces complemented it well.  my favorite condiment was the green tea salt with the tofu.\n\nthe robata items were perfectly cooked.  the bacon you use to wrap around the mushrooms, asparagus wasn't too salty as is the usual problem for me at other robata restaurants.   the enoki was cooked to a chewy perfection, as was the pork cheek, beef tendon, shishito, chicken wings.  \n\nof all the items, i think i loved the <mark>Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard</mark> the most.  the texture, the taste, and the presentation.  \n\nthe oden soup base was refreshing and you can add items to it a la carte.  we opted for the daikon, chikuwa, bean curd with mochi inside, and uni (which comes separately with wakame).  the meal was ended delightfully with a grilled onigiri in broth.  perfect ending to a perfect meal.  thank you!\n\nps.  the bathroom is also super nice.  love the aquarium!!", 
            "we drove to vegas on thursday night and i was yelping on the car looking for a sushi restaurant in vegas. raku was popped up w/ highest rating and late open. we got there at 1:00am and it was only us and another table. this is what we ordered : <mark>Sashimi Salad</mark>, foie gras, grilled kobe beef, tongue, liver, and tendon, home made  <mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark>. the food was so good, fresh and good portion. \n\n i love brown sugar plum wine there.  the waitress was nice enough to bring out the bottle so i could take the pix ( i'm still looking to buy it when i'm back to oc but no sign yet) \n\ni wanted to make the reservation for 10  courses kaiseki meal but it is 3 day advanced reservation.  i definitely would come back for this", 
            "yes it's true, the restaurant has an air of la snob. \n\ndon't even think about walking in without an reservation, it's impossible to get a seat even though a lot of seats may look empty. apparently, there are \"reservations.\" we saw this happen to many people and we also attempted at it once.\n\nwe were 10 minutes early for our reservation but since the restaurant hadn't technically \"opened\" yet, we were made to wait outside in the grimy chinatown sidewalk. which was fine. then we saw 4 international guests walk out of the restaurant fully fed and intoxicated. these guys were probably friends with the chef/owner or were especially special guests because the staff were farewelling them and all this fancy stuff. this was fine too. so we were the only 2 waiting outside and finally the restaurant had opened but we weren't sure if we could enter because the door was still closed and the hostess didn't invite us in. so we waited some more and finally we thought screw it let's go inside. we got in and there was no \"thank you for waiting\" courtesy and the chef was standing around in his undershirt. finally, we got seated and i have to admit i started dinner a little bit aggravated and unsure why i was here. \n\nthe cold service was quickly forgotten as i dove into our first dish (kanpachi), then our second, then our third, fourth, fifth...twelveth. the food was ridiculously delicious -- japanese food taken to another level! the service gets better once you are seated and you order food. the waitress describes and food and is polite.\n\nmy favorite items:\n1. raku's tofu - homemade, best tofu i've ever eaten\n2. <mark>Sashimi Salad</mark> - the dressing is superb\n3. kobe beef outside skirt with garlic - obviously this is going to be awesome!\n4. butter saut\\u00e9ed scallop with soy sauce - i wished i ordered more of this dish. sharing one was simply not enough for me!\n5. daily special: kanpachi - super fresh\n6. daily special: blue crab miso soup - you can actually taste both ingredients.\n\nmaybe will order again:\n1. melting chocolate cake - if i have room, i'd order this again\n2. green tea creme brulee - this one was standard, nothing special\n\nwouldn't order again:\n1. <mark>Poached Egg</mark> with sea urchin and salmon roe - visually and ideally appealing but the texture creeped me out. i thought i was eating really flavorful phlegm. \n2. <mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark> - raku's tofu was better because the simple ingredients enhanced the tofu. the agedashi was a bit overpowered by sauce. \n3. oyako don chicken and egg - i don't think it's a dish you should order at a restaurant like this\n4. oyster isobeyaki - the way it was grilled made the oyster way too chewy for my taste. and, i didn't like the crispy seaweed accompanying it. \n\nalso, if you have time check out my photos of all the things we ate!", 
            "my wife and i began our 10 year anniversary weekend with visit to raku as we drove into vegas at 1:45 am on friday night (saturday morning, actually).  fortunately for us, the kitchen was making its last call and we still had time to order.\n\nbest dishes:\n<mark>Poached Egg</mark> with sea urchin (salmon roe, jalapeno, mushrooms, mountain root in soba broth served cold) - amazing well constructed with a perfectly <mark>Poached Egg</mark> and various layers of flavor that all worked together.  a bargain at $9.\nfoie gras chawanmushi (<mark>Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard</mark> with a hint of foie gras, smoked duck and black truffle) - creamy, rich, delicious!  $10\n<mark>Juicy Deep Fried Chicken</mark> (six medallions of chicken, fried, over a bed of baby spinach) - we weren't going to order this, but our waitress highly recommended it, and we're glad she did. $9\nenoki mushroom with bacon - great flavor from the grill and a thick, lean, juicy cut of bacon. $2.80 for two.\nkamo grilled duck (with balsamic soy sauce) - tender, well seasoned, and not gamey at all.\n\ngood dishes:  <mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark>, momo chicken thigh, grilled veal\n\ndisappointing:  kobe beef with wasabi (surprisingly ordinary), tontoro kurobuta pork cheek (too fatty for our taste), <mark>Sashimi Salad</mark> (expected more from raku)\n\nregarding some topics raised by other reviewers:\nprice.  we thought the prices were quite reasonable for a restaurant of this quality.\nservice.  for the most part, the wait staff was pleasant and informative.  they were not very attentive - we did have to ask for refills, etc.  but, because the restaurant was small and not crowded, it was fairly easy to get their attention.\n\noverall, this was a great meal and a fantastic way to start our 10th anniversary weekend.", 
            "how do we celebrate end of semester?  by eating, of course!  nick actually had a dream about raku the night before - guess you can imagine how much we were looking forward to it.\n\na pitcher of soporo and raku tofu started us off nicely.  we've learned to order a bunch of stuff right from the start and then add a bit as we go for the best rhythm.  from the board:  shrimp dumplings were beautifully delicate and oh-so-slightly seasoned; the pork ribs performed exactly as described (to tender they fell off the bone), and the whole fish (sorry, can't remember the name) was super fresh and delicate.\n\nmy regular grilled must-haves:  tomatoes, pork cheek, <mark>Juicy Deep Fried Chicken</mark> (no green chilies tonight - sad face).\n\n<mark>Sashimi Salad</mark> is always a treat, and the <mark>Crispy Fried Shrimp</mark> are crunchy goodness (yes, head to almost tail).  mmmm....", 
            "recently dined here and god damn it is freaking awesome ordered: aji shima, kobe with garlic, house tofu half fried / half regular, <mark>Sashimi Salad</mark>, foie gras, enoki with bacon, rice ball with salmon broth, green tea creme brulee.\n\neverything was delicious and the dessert - green tea creme brulee was just amazing the custard was also green tea! it is a must i will be back here again!", 
            "raku should be synonymous with mastered the technique cooking.\n\ntrue japanese, true skill, and too tasty!\n\nwhat you should good ranking:\n\n1. yellow-tail\n2. <mark>Sashimi Salad</mark>\n3. <mark>Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard</mark>\n4. home made tofu(half fried/natural)\n5. kobe beef garlic \n6. green tea creme brulee\n7. pork ears\n8. grilled asparagus\n9. grilled mushroom\n10. <mark>Juicy Deep Fried Chicken</mark>", 
            "raku broke through the glass ceiling of my expectations of what a great meal is in las vegas. my companion and i made reservations on a saturday night and there were no open ones until 9:30 - i would recommend reservations early as the waitress said that she couldn't see any open seats when we called at 6. \n\nupon walking in we were told to sit at some high chairs near the back while we waited for a table to be cleared. we examined the room, noting the cleanliness and deliberateness of the space and after a minute or two were taken to a table. \n\nwith some cash to blow and empty stomachs to fill we began to pick out some things on the menu that instantly caught our eye - <mark>Sashimi Salad</mark>, yellow-tail carpaccio, <mark>Juicy Deep Fried Chicken</mark>, a miso soup (i always have to order one), kobe beef skirt with garlic, scallop with soy sauce, duck with balsamic soy sauce, and mushrooms to start off the night.\n\nthe food came out in a more logical way than we ordered it. first, the <mark>Sashimi Salad</mark> was insanely good! the fish, greens and dressing complimented each other very well giving us a balanced start to our meal. the yellow-tail carpaccio came out as we were finishing the salad; the yellow-tail was fresh, had amazing texture and simply was astounding. the <mark>Juicy Deep Fried Chicken</mark> was very rich - i had a hard time eating more than one (although my companion easily scarfed down the rest of them!). despite my love for miso soup i find that they never vary between restaurants too much - raku's soup will be noted in having tiny, whole mushroom and large chunks of tofu. kobe beef skirt with garlic was tender and juicy with a great flavor. my companion really loved the duck; i found it quite tasty as well. the mushrooms made a great appearence by breaking up the flow of all the meat/fish dishes we had been having. \n\nand then there was the scallop. oh man, that scallop was revolutionary. the waitress dropped off the scallop served inside of the shell with soy sauce on top; my companion and i split it and were amazed at the light sweetness, the soft texture and the overall quality of the dish. \n\nwe were full. and then we noticed - the menu contains a few items with a red symbol next to them. i asked the waitress what that meant and she explained those were the specialties of raku. specialties? and we hadn't tried the restaurant's specialties? despite our full stomachs we continued onward to order <mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark> and tsukene ground chicken. we agreed both far exceeded our expectations - i had never tried tofu that has been prepared better and i could eat the ground chicken every day for the rest of my life (a guy can dream, right?). \n\nand then the finisher, the end, the encore of the concert, the final chapter in a book, the last mile of the marathon - dessert. green tea creme brulee with green tea ice cream on top. our stomachs were exploding before we got this, we devoured the whole thing and deliberated very seriously on getting another one. we decided against it only because we had reached stomach capacity. \n\nthe food can be costly if you order a lot. however, the experience was well worth the $76.80 subtotal for two people tasting that much food. \n\namazing atmosphere, quality ingredients, fantastic company (your mileage may vary), professionally prepared and plated with great service - everything that anyone wants in a dining experience. \n\nhave you noticed how much i loved this place? i'm having a hard time even explaining - it's like having an adrenaline rush and remembering how fun, exciting, interesting and amazing the experience was wihtout having any more words to share with others than \"try it yourself.\" you will be super happy that you did and have an awesome time.",

            "amazing restaurant! everything was fresh and unique.  i was impressed by everything on their menu.  first of all, since it's been almost a year since foie gras was banned in california, of course that jumped off their menu, and was the first thing that i wanted to order.  but there were so many other mouth watering dishes!  good thing there were 4 of us in our group, so we could order practically everything!\n\ndefinitely check out their daily specials.  there's going to be something terrific on there.  the day i went, we ordered:\n- grilled alaskan king crab\n- uni udon - a must have if you like uni!!!!!!\n- blue fin tuna sashimi\n\nitems on their regular menu that we had:\n- <mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark>: fresh tofu, and served in a whole block\n- <mark>Sashimi Salad</mark>: ridiculously fresh sashimi!\n- <mark>Yellowtail Carpaccio</mark>\n- <mark>Poached Egg</mark> with uni and salmon roe\n- <mark>Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard</mark>\n- kobe beef fillet with wasabi: we had to order this with all of the reviews that mentioned it, but it didn't live up to the hype. :( good but not phenomenal.\n- kurobata pork cheek : a must order!\n- duck with balsamic soy sauce: very tasty!\n- butter sauteed scallop with soy sauce\n- enoki mushroom wrapped with bacon\n- japanese shishito peppers\n\nto finish off an amazing meal, we had to have dessert.  the green tea creme brulee was the perfect way to end the meal!\n\ni never knew about raku before, but i am raving about it now.  i won't be able to take a vegas trip without stopping by, now.", 
            "since this place is on so many \"top ten\" lists, i thought for sure that i was going to get a very expensive, maybe good experience. very pleased to be wrong on that front! staff was very helpful when explaining the menu and the items were all well prepared and extremely tasty. the standouts were the raku's tofu (get the full order--we got the half and ended up ordering it twice), the <mark>Sashimi Salad</mark> (very generous for the price), the duck with balsamic soy glaze, the enoki mushrooms with bacon and the <mark>Crispy Asparagus Okaki</mark>. we stuck mostly with the skewers and were surprisingly full given the small bites. and our check was not astronomical--a plus! this is now on our list of places to go in vegas.", 
            "simply the best non-sushi japanese restaurant in vegas and probably the west coast.  think smooth flavored japanese charcoal meets awesome cuts of meat.  \n\nwe started with the <mark>Sashimi Salad</mark>.  amazing flavor.  then we went on to the house fresh made tofu with home brewed soy sauce.  i'm not a fan of tofu but it was awesome.  all along the way we did the cold sake sampler.  super smooth, super dry, flavorful sake.  the hamachi capaccio was so fresh.  \n\nfrom there it was wagu beef, balsamic duck, chicken thighs, chicken wings, salmon, portabello mushrooms, beef stomach, and more.  \n\nthe place is open 5 pm to 3am.  best to wait outside at 5 pm and go early as many specials are gone by 8 pm.", 
            "i love the food here. its very delicious. we ordered wasabi beef, a <mark>Sashimi Salad</mark> and a butter scallop. the servers were also friendly and do as you ask and are very helpful. the reason why it isnt 5 stars are the prices for the portions of food. it is very little for the prices offered. it was $7 for one piece of scallop. it was not worth it.", 
            "simply amazing! one of the best restaurants i have ever eaten in. the <mark>Poached Egg</mark> with sea urchin and salmon roe, the <mark>Sashimi Salad</mark>, and the kobe beef and iberico pork are a must.", 
            "raku is one of the best japanese restaurants i've been to and way better than most japanese restaurants in san francisco.  everything prepared on the robata grill is exquisite - everything finishes with a smoky finish.  i especially loved the ibarico pork, duck breast with balsamic vinegar. other items like the <mark>Crispy Asparagus Okaki</mark>, onsen tamago with uni and ikura, <mark>Sashimi Salad</mark>, agedashi handmade tofu, foie gras don - all delicious.  very nice staff - service is japanese specialty.",

            "awful customer service.   made a potential 5 star experience turn into 3.  did not have reservations so we sat at the bar. didn't realize there was a specials menu until we saw a server carry the black board over to a different guest sitting at the bar.  someone sat next to us and we kindly asked if they didn't mind scooting down one, as someone else would be joining us.  the server came over upset and rude telling us that we can't do that, even though he was willing to move. she told us that the host needs to know.  when we tried to ask the host he was too busy to care and said he would come back. within less than 5 min our friend arrived so we stood at the bar waiting. the host did not offer a seat until our friend already walked out the door because of the poor service. the seat he offered was opposite of the guest who was sitting alone. they would really seat us apart from eachother?!  really was a downer on our evening. and tonight was the one night in 2 years that my friend and i had together. really stuck up here.  a shame the food was decent. <mark>Sashimi Salad</mark> was good if you are looking for something raw. yellowtail was good quality fish, but i've had it better prepared elsewhere. the item that stands out the best are wagyu skewers tender, flavorful, and the fat of it just melts. we ordered all the desserts. the cheesecake was worth getting, light with a chocolate crust. the chef tried to make up for the service. he was much kinder and served us water when the waitress wouldn't come by.  for the price, and experience there was nothing on the menu worth coming back for.  had it not been for how we were treated there would have been other items i would like to come back and  try. i appreciate great food and don't mind spending to have a good time. to spend that kind of money where they are not kind or accommodating isn't worth it. they put us in a bad mood.", 
            "a must-eat when i go to las vegas.  i can probably go on about a lot of these items, but my absolute fave go-to's would be: \n1.  <mark>Sashimi Salad</mark> (cannot rave enough about this)\n2.  <mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark> (it's homemade tofu!)\n3.  <mark>Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard</mark> (don't ask. just eat)\n\nthey always have different special items everyday as well that are pretty good too.  i have heard people rave about the omakase but have not yet tried.  maybe next time!",

            "rsvpd a few days in advance for dinner at 6:30 on a thursday. we didn't need to wait once we arrived, and luckily got seated towards the quieter back. \n\nwhat we got:\n\n<mark>Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard</mark>- love steamed scrambled egg, chinese people eat it with cooking wine, but their foie gras infusion was killer. great texture too. the only thing i don't like about foie gras, well one of the things, is the livery aftertaste. the custard still had that aftertaste. \n\nfoie gras skewer- for $17 it didn't disappoint. literally melt in your mouth! could've been enough for four i think, but our foie gras aficionado finished it off for us. \n\ngreen tea cold noodle - nice, simple dish that contrasted with the rich, flavorful dishes we ordered afterward. i don't know what the process is for serving cold dishes first, but i would've appreciated this cold noodle more after eating the foie gras. light dish in contrast to the heavy richness of the foie gras. \n\nscallop - served in a hot shell. i didn't think it was amazing. \n\nsea urchin with salmon roe- i'm not a uni fan, but this combo with the <mark>Poached Egg</mark> was awesome. sweet, light, gooey, & interesting textures (bubble like roe & mushrooms held together by the gooey egg yolk). like how the yolk balanced out the uni. \n\n<mark>Sashimi Salad</mark> - that was delicious. i loved the sashimi with the miso dressing. refreshing way to whet our appetites. \n\nraku tofu- you can dress it two ways, and i preferred the chives + soy sauce way. the more i ate it the hungrier i got - so as an appetizer it did its job (making us hungrier and ready for the heartier meat dishes). \n\niberian pork skewers - a special at $10/skewer. i thought it was a tad undercooked, but the meat was definitely tender and fatty. not a huge fan though and prob won't order it again. \n\nwaygu beef sashimi - aka raw beef. after eating this i realized i like my beef cooked medium rare. the beef was tender, but really chewy due to the fat on it. like people in my party were having trouble eating it it was so chewy. at $20 a plate, i'd skip this at the next go round. \n\n<mark>Juicy Deep Fried Chicken</mark>: dark chicken meat cooked like a pot roast, but with a thin crispy skin (like roast duck skin except with chicken). chicken was underdone. truth be told, we only ordered it bc the table next to us ordered it and i'm a fattie that loves me some <mark>Juicy Deep Fried Chicken</mark>. \n\noverall: i generally thought everything needed some salt (not the green tea salt on the table), and most of the red meats and \"other white meats\" could've been cooked slightly more. \n\nservice was very polite, though slightly over attentive. i'm not used to someone constantly coming by your table, switching out your plates after every two dishes, etc. \n\nand it's a very clean restaurant! i read in a cooking book (kitchen confidential) that you can tell how clean a kitchen is by how clean the bathrooms are. the bathroom here was very clean, very japanese (ie super high tech toilets that required actual reading to operate) with an aquarium! i guess they were trying to make us feel like we were in an aquarium too with the blue walls & tile (i'm analyzing this bathroom waaaay too much...)."

            "aww, people -- none of you newbies even checked out the potty?   c'mon, i know the <mark>Tofu Salad</mark> rocks, the beer is cheap, the service cheerful -- but if you got to raku and miss a trip to the bathroom -- then 1 of 2 things is happening:\n\n1) you're either traumatized from other trips to asian restaurant bathrooms...\nor \n2) you didn't read my review.\n\nseriously -- go to the potty.\n\nraku's is a veritable \"hoot\"....  yep -- totally worthy of the drive off strip to the restaurant just to go to the bathroom -- \n\nthe food is also fabulous -- but the bathroom will make you laugh for days.\n\nor longer, depending on how much $ you've lost in the market downturn...", 
            "wonderful little place hidden in a strip mall.  loved the bacon wrapped enoki mushrooms, so much that i ordered a second order! the pork cheek, simple <mark>Tofu Salad</mark>, chicken stuffed mushroom, and kobe with wasabi were also winners. for desert we had a heavenly brown sugar pudding.  and the ton of  food we ordered was super cheap, especially considering the prices on the strip. they offer wine and saki flights, and the service is friendly and helpful. those out on vacation should take a moment off the strip, it's worth it! and of course the locals hit the jackpot here.", 
            "this place is one of my favorite restaurants !  the first few months that it first opened, i was coming here every few days.  it was costly , but well worth it.  costly , only because i would always get a bottle of sake and order some items off their special  menu.   that said, meals here are reasonable.\n       tofu wasn't one of my fav foods until  i tried it here.  their <mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark> and <mark>Tofu Salad</mark> are incredible !   fresh and oh so creamy (waitress said tofu is made daily ).  the other dishes i always get are lamb chops, fois gras , chicken breast w/skin, ground chicken , kobe beef w/wasabi, <mark>Sashimi Salad</mark>, and meat intestines in soup.  i usually get a few other items, but these are my core.", 
            "we usually come to vegas at least twice a year.  we wanted to try someplace new after a long day at hoover dam and the grand canyon we stumbled across raku based on the reviews of our fellow yelpers.  \n\ndon't let the outside fool you, as the inside is nicely decorated.  the restroom makes a good conversation piece, you just have to see it for yourself.  \n\nwe ordered the following:\n<mark>Tofu Salad</mark>:  reminds me of the japanese version of a caprese salad.  made with handmade tofu which is their specialty.  hands down the best <mark>Tofu Salad</mark> i have ever tasted and close to the best tofu i've had in this country.  especially good with the green tea salt.\n\naji (prepared sashimi and fried):  both ways were exceptional.  my only complaint was the sashimi pieces were small, but then it is about quality, not quantity.  be prepared to spend $30 for this dish.\n\n<mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark>:  good dish as well.  their special homemade tofu and the ikura topping were the highlights of this dish.\n\nkurobota pork cheek:  i like this, but my boyfriend wasn't a fan.\n\ntsukune:  average at best.  i recommend you try something else.\n\nhamburg steak:  great dish.  somewhat large, it is about the size of two hamburg steaks on top of each other.  they serve it in a sizzling hotpot with egg, mushrooms and onions.  when the waitress poured the sauce over the top, it didn't quite sizzle to her liking, so she was kind enough to bring it to the back so they could heat the pot.\n\nto drink, we had the sake trio sampler for $18.  we were able to substitute two of the drinks for something else we wanted to try.  our favorite was the hananomai and we ended up ordering a few glasses at $15 each.\n\nin the end, we experienced nothing but excellent service along with excellent food.  on top of everything, they are open until 3am.  this place is highly recommended if you are in the mood for great japanese food.", 
            "i am going to start with dessert because they are absolutely to die for. if you craving dessert after a night out (open till 3am!), please order the cheesecake or the chocolate lava cake.\nthe cheesecake is like nothing i have had before. actually, i call it a cloud cake. it is so incredibly light and fluffy. its not overly sweet and it just melts away in your mouth. its the best.\n\nof course i love chocolate and the molten lava cake is done very well here :)\n\nthe food here for vegetarians is limited. the home made <mark>Tofu Salad</mark> has cold raw tofu in it. if you enjoy tofu in that form, its interesting to try it.\nthe veggies from the robata grill section are great. my fave being the potato and corn. (corn core is taken out and filled with mashed potato. mmmmm)\nthe asparagus crispy tempura - its in a panko? or something batter.. really good. and fried green hot peppers are also very good.\n\nif you dont eat fish: all the sauces and broths have fish in it and be careful to say no fish flakes because they like to put it on top of everything!\n\ncan be pricey: the robata grill are tiny portions...2-4 pieces of the vegetable so that can definitely add up in cost when you are ordering oh about 15 of them...\nthe best deal is the cheesecake at $5. yes, i love the cloud cake :)",

            "i came without a reservation on thursday evening around 7:30 pm and lucked out - i  was seated at the counter.\n\ni hadn't ordered the omakase here before so went that route. here's what i received:\n<mark>Tofu Salad</mark> with seaweed - refreshing \namberjack sashimi with sliced radish - incredible!\nrobata grilled cherry tomatoes - yummy\nyellowtail skewer with soy based sauce and minced daikon - awesome tasting\n<mark>Juicy Deep Fried Chicken</mark> with spinach - crispy on the outside so tender and flavorful\nkobe beef skewer with garlic - stellar\nib\\u00e9rico de bellota pork skewer - best pork i've eaten\ncold green soba noodles with <mark>Poached Egg</mark> - so refreshing\n\nas previous encounters at raku, i was totally satisfied and content with the quality, taste and value of my dinning experience. the service here is stellar. yes the meal took over a 90 minutes but everything is prepared to order. my only con that evening was i was unable to finish my soba noodles bc i was to full!", 
            "i am fully aware of how yelpers in general have an unconditional and unwavering love for this place, just like i'm very aware of the \"yelpers love us\" sticker on the door. the reviews were one of the reasons we decided to come to this place, however, its also one of the few times that i have disagreed with the raving reviews of yelp.\n\nwe came here about 1 am on a wednesday morning and even though there were open seats, they still felt that we should wait before being seated. 10 minutes later, we were seated at one of the open seats.\n\nfrom the onset, the service was a bit slow. our server asked if we were ready to order right away, but we asked for a minute. it was only after about 15 minutes of waiting we decided to flag our server to order. the food also came slowly but that wasn't really the issue.\n\nso down to the food. we ordered:\n\n1) aohata nabe: this was basically a fish stew. this was 40 dollars and my least favorite item that we ordered. it wasn't bad, but it wasn't particularly good either.\n\n2) <mark>Tofu Salad</mark>: this simple item was probably one of my favorites. it's 7 dollars and pretty flavorful with their green tea salt.\n\n3) <mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark>: i know that this item is all that yelpers rave about, and it was good, but cooome on... its not that good! 10 dollars. actually, i thought it was just \"ok.\"\n\n4) <mark>Crispy Asparagus Okaki</mark>. this was actually really good. it tasted like asparagus with japanese cracker crumbs. 5 dollars.\n\n5) <mark>Juicy Deep Fried Chicken</mark>: simple <mark>Juicy Deep Fried Chicken</mark> served much like a sushi roll. these tasted great. 9 dollars.\n\n6) tsukune: the ground chicken was my 2nd least favorite. just very ehh. $3.50.\n\n7) enoki mushroom w/ bacon: this was probably my favorite item of the night, simple yet very tasty. $2.80.\n\n8) scallop w/ soy sauce: the scallop was amazing, especially with the sauce that it comes in. loved this. 7 dollars.\n\nwe tried to order the pork belly but they were out.\n\nall in all, perhaps because of the raving reviews, this place was a slight disappointment. from the slow service to the aohata nabe, things were just a bit off with the whole experience. \n\nthe food, in general, is good, but its not that good. this experience reminds the moment when walking out of the movie theaters after watching hunger games. overrated. i'm saying this as a person that loves japanese food (and i'm not talking about california rolls as japanese food), but real authentic japanese food.\n\nif you're in the mood for tasty no-frills chinese/malaysian food at about 1/6 of the price, go to big wong, only a few feet away from raku."
