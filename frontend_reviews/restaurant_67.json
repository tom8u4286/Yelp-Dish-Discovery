            "ugh, i ate here on sunday and i still feel ill just thinking about it.\n\nto begin with, the dining experience is terrible, and i can give five good examples right here. \n\n1. they served a strangely sweet lobster bisque, and then later dumped that same weird-tasting bisque over the surf and turf gnocchi pasta and attempted to pass it off as \"sauce.\"  same unappetizing color and flavor.\n\n2. cold \"house fries.\" mind you, it was 12:30 pm (lunch) and there weren't that many people. i reason that the fries, at the very least, should've been made fresh for the amount of time it took to get them.\n\n3. the bread and butter were both hard as a rock. the butter must have been right out of the fridge. the bread...probably the same.\n\n4. <mark>Vietnamese Banh Mi Sandwich</mark> was soggy and mediocre (a word i don't typically use to describe things with pork belly). \n\n5. they serve beverages in tall goblets with long straws, so there's no good way to drink your soda without looking/feeling awkward or having your damn straw fall out of the glass if you move it wrong. it sounds trivial, but this is just annoying to me. \n\nif nothing else, they should at least ditch their \"voted best gourmet restaurant in las vegas\" brag (no sources or dates listed on the website) and embrace the true novelty of the place. \n\ni realize \"you're paying for the view,\" as so many other reviewers have stated. this ought to just become the restaurant's motto. the carnies working the elevators and the skydiving tourists dropping outside the window and interrupting the otherwise beautiful view just don't bring to mind a \"fancy\" restaurant. there's a huge marketing clash here.\n\ni've never written a review in my life, but i think a sub-mediocre experience at any vegas restaurant with $$$$ as a price range indicator is ammo for heavy scrutiny."

            "come here for the view and not the food!  the view is breathtaking, yes.  the food, well, is just okay.  since it was sunday, we had complimentary champagne.  my friend and i had an excellent lobster bisque...downside...it was luke warm!  what a way to destroy a first impression.  the ceasar salad was a bit drenched in dressing, otherwise tasty.  the kobe burger came out fully pink in the middle and we had to send it back.  fortunately, our waiter was able to comp us for <mark>The Ultra Burger</mark>.  the service was very good and the wait staff were all very attentive, promptly refilling our waters and checking in with us. \n\nwe went at around 3pm and the sun really hit us hard at one point.  this place is just beautiful around sunset.", 
            "i went to this restaurant with my husband, sister in law and brother in law. i was excited because it was supposed to be really good food and the view is supposed to be something really exciting. \n\nwhen we first went up the elevator to the restaurant and got off....you have to go through a metal detector before entering this restaurant which if you ask me is a bit paranoid. it was a bit much and a little disconcerting thinking that they need metal detectors because...a) they've had threats or b) they are just really paranoid. \n\nwe sat down and i'm a larger person and so is my husband. their chairs are all the same size...not large enough to accommodate a larger person. we both had to sit on the front edge of the seat the entire time we were there. it was not comfortable at all, but we were happy to do so thinking the meal would be well worth it. \n\nwe started looking through the menu and was a bit disappointed because there just wasn't that much to choose from. i opted for the hamburger and my husband got the lobster ravioli. both my sister and brother in law got the hamburgers. \n\nwe waited for what seemed like forever to get our food and there wasn't many other people in the restaurant at the time so we didn't understand what was taking so long. it was about a 40 minute wait. \n\nthe waiter finally came back with our food and i got a whiff of my husbands lobster ravioli and almost gagged. it smelled horrible! but i looked at my burger and it wasn't the well done that i ordered it was less than well done. but i never send anything back to the chef...no way. \n\n<mark>The Ultra Burger</mark> is huge and it comes with large slices of tomato and lettuce...if i would have put all that on my burger there is no way i would have been able to even take a bite of it, it was too big. \n\nthe bun was dry, <mark>The Ultra Burger</mark> tasted like it hadn't been seasoned at all and the tomotoes were too big to eat on <mark>The Ultra Burger</mark>. it was a tasteless burger and i wouldn't recommend this restaurant. \n\nmy husband couldn't even eat his lobster ravioli because he said it had an awful taste to it. i tasted it and he was right, i almost spit it back into my napkin. i've never tasted anything so retched in all my life. i will never go there again.", 
            "well i've only been here twice but it seems like that was enough times. we've only gone for lunch since it seems like you get the same food at half the price with the same view(which is kind of what you're paying for.) the service is good but the food itself leaves you expecting to have had more. the pastas are good, however, i like the pasta at the italian restaurant downstairs more. i've tried <mark>The Ultra Burger</mark> which were actually really good, however last time i had a philly cheese<mark>Grilled Wagyu Skirt Steak & Portobello Sandwich</mark> and it was a little on the small side. sure $15 isn't outrageous for a sandwich, you just expect it to be a slightly bigger size. also, last time we went, there was a woman who kept walking behind us so that she could take pictures outside the window. this isn't that bad, but when she kept doing it over and over for 10 minutes straight, eventually, we'd like to be able to enjoy the view rather than stare at her ass in our faces the whole time. i thought the staff could have really said something to her after she just wouldn't sit down. also, the fire alarm was set off downstairs while we were eating and it was going off for what was literally 10-15 minutes. this is a long time to have a very loud blaring alarm going off while you are paying for what i consider a classy restaraunt experience. the manager did come around to every table and apologize after about 5, minutes, and then came around again to every table to let us know that they were working on turning it off. that's nice, but after 15 minutes of not being able to hear each other speak and having this blaring alarm in our ears, i really thought we could expect some kind of discount. 10% or at least a free drink. i understand you can't go around looking for free stuff all the time, but when you're paying for a classy experience and as your food arrives you have to sit there and listen to a fire alarm going off right next your ears(it wasn't in the room over or somewhere far away, it was loud, and in the dining area), you'd expect something, right? well we didn't get anything comped which was surprising for how bad our experience was, and then we had to wait 10 minutes for the elevators to start working again since they shut off automatically when the fire alarm goes off. we thought about going upstairs to walk around but when we saw the crowd of people on the observation deck waiting for an elevator, we walked back down to wait in their lounge area. i'm not saying this place is bad, i just think for the price you could definitely get better, and you don't wan't to know what it's like to pay $25-$30 a person to get front row tickets to the fire alarm concert.", 
            "the view alone is worth a million bucks!\n\ni wanted to take my wife somewhere nice, and somewhere we have never been before so i decided on taking her here for lunch.  it was a perfect date!\n\ni made some reservations on opentable.com for 12:30.  we got there early and it wasn't that busy so they told us to head on up.  to get there is a mission in itself.  you are lead over to a metal detector where a security guard asks you to empty out your pockets etc.   you are then led to the elevator and you get in. up to floor 106!   you exit the elevator and then are greeted by the hostess and led to your table.  you cant even put into words what the view is like.  you are almost 900 feet up, in a revolving restaurant and you can see for what seems like an infinite distance!  its a sight to see and if you are in vegas, you have to come here at least one time...you will be glad you did! the restaurant rotates very slow.  it takes an hour and twenty minutes to make a full 360 so if you take your time eating lunch, you can see all of las vegas.  its such an amazing sight to see.  words cant describe it.   as far as the food...........\n\nfor an appetizer, i ordered the flash fried calamari.  i rarely get to eat calamari and wanted to try theirs out.  it comes with 2 different sauces, a wasabi white sauce and a tomato sauce.  i liked the tomato one better.  i ate all of it because the wife doesn't like seafood and it was an excellent starter.  they also give you some cibatta bread with regular butter and a chili butter.  good stuff!   for our entrees, i went with <mark>The Ultra Burger</mark> and got it topped with the horseradish crust and fried onion strings.  it came with french fries too.  <mark>The Ultra Burger</mark> was cooked perfectly medium and was tasty as can be.  the wife ordered their pesto pasta with chicken.  she let me have some and it was really good too.  the service was spot on, very attentive.  total bill after tip was about $65 for lunch which seems like a lot, but once you get up to that restaurant and sit down, its totally worth the money!  \n\nadded bonus, you can go up to the top floor and go outside on the deck after you are done.  if you want to go up there by itself, i think it was either $14 or $16 per person so getting lunch for only $30 bucks more is a bargain in itself.   it was a great experience and i will definitely come back and recommend this to everyone i know!", 
            "i have eaten here several times before with great results. this last time, just several days ago, not so much.\n\nit all started with stopping in at the check-in desk on the 2nd floor. was told there was a 45 minute wait for lunch. fine, we will wait. we ask to go to the bar and were told that the main bar was closed till four. we ask about the other bar one level above the restaurant. the woman then starts ranting and raving, not making any sense. kept throwing around $16, $16. our party of four had no idea what she was saying. this went on for like ten minutes, not kidding. it was very odd. we had no intention of trying to get to the top for \"free\" and i think that was her concern. she barely spoke english and not us or another group standing there could make heads or tails of what she was saying. she then says \"yes, you can go to bar upstairs before lunch\". i guess you had to be there, but we were like omg. laughed about it all the way up. \n\nhad a drink at the bar, very nice bartender there. waited the 45 minutes for a table.  waited and waited for an elevator. should have taken the stairs but someone said the door would be locked. \n\nhad a nice table with a nice view.  one woman took our drink orders. great. another took our meal order.  hubbie and i each wanted a bowl of lobster bisque soup and then we were going to split a burger. hubbie likes his medium rare, me, i like medium but will eat medium rare.  waitress comes out with hubbie's soup and walks away.  we are kinda laughing now, as this is just getting funny.  call the waitress and explain i should have gotten a bowl of soup also and she just give me a look and says \"no, it is your entree\". we again explain splitting <mark>The Ultra Burger</mark>, etc. all is good. \n\nuntil the entree's are served. our friends each got a salad which were huge and really good.  but our burger is raw, not rare, not medium rare, but pure and simple raw hamburger meat. we were going to send it back, but between not seeing a wait person anywhere and questioning what they would do, not that this would be our second situation, hubbie decided to eat what he could. i had nothing but the soup and bread. no one ever came to inquire about the food. no one ever took another drink order even though our glasses had been empty since we got the soup, etc. not quire sure how they can even serve food like that. aren't there some health guidelines about raw meat unless it is tar-tare?  all is still good, we are in vegas and  that trumps all.\n\ni still wasn't going to say a word, simply not worth it. hubbie is getting ready to do the jump off strat so that is all we were talking about anyway,  deserts were offered and declined and the bill put on the table. now, i never check a bill, i just let hubbie handle it, so it was weird i picked it up to look at it.  i notice we were charged a $6 or $8 meal split.  when the waitress came over to take our payment, i questioned her on that and that she probably should have pointed it out when we ordered. now, if she would have been like \"oh, sorry, it is on the menu\" or something like that, i would have shrugged it off and paid the bill. still would have been left with a bad feeling about the whole thing, but instead she was like \"what do you want me to do about it? it is right there on the menu\". when i questioned her if perhaps she should point it out when people split a meal, wouldn't that be better for everyone all around. she pretty much responded with \"you should have read the menu\".  all said with a smirk and in broken english. now, i was pissed.\n\nlaughed at the check in woman, laughed at the elevator situation (although whose fault that is, is anyone's guess) laughed at the non existent service, laughed at being served raw meat, but mock me and be openly rude to me, that quite possible was my breaking point, and i asked to speak to a manager. \n\nan assistant manager did come to talk with us. we tried telling him the whole story, but he was stuck on the check in woman and kept coming back to that  and how people try to avoid that $16 charge all the time. oh lord, again with the $16 charge. in all fairness, he did take off all the food charges and we only paid for our one drink each, but the whole thing left a bad taste in my mouth. and we did tip on the original bill.\n\nin full disclosure, the four of us are big foodies. the top of the world at stratosphere tries very hard to compete with the eiffel tower at paris and does not compare. we ate a special anniversary dinner there the night before. the restaurant manager emailed me, set up reservations, set up a special table by the windows with red plates and rose petals all over the table and special comped deserts. we were very impressed and i highly recommend that restaurant to everyone. we dropped over $400 there just the night previous.\n\nmaybe they are better prepared at dinner. that is when we have eaten there before.  just be aware of what can happen during lunch.", 
            "had lunch with my brother and sister here, we didn't have reservation but were seated shortly.\n\nservice was 5 stars-\neven when we didn't look much, we were still taken care of with 5 star treatment. the waitress was very nice and didn't hold it against us that we were not in our sunday's best.\n\nfood 4 1/2 stars-\nwe ordered from the lunch menu, they had the 2 specials, my brother got <mark>The Ultra Burger</mark> and sister went for the crab cakes. both were great. i had the salad which was scrumptious too. we shared a petit four of desserts. unbelievably moist chocolate cake, the other 3 were good too but i was too blown away by the chocolate cake that i can not imagine talking about them.  \n\nambiance 5 stars-\nwhilst you sit enjoying the food, the restaurant imperceptibly revolve, thus you are afforded a spectacular 360 view of las vegas. every so often you witness some bad @$$ bungee jump off the side of the building. talk about extreme!\n\none of a kind experience and only in vegas!", 
            "top of the world restaurant, located on the top level of the stratosphere hotel and casino, is a bit of old school fine dining that banks heavily on its rotating dining room that offers a wonderful view of las vegas and the surrounding area. the reviews seem to run hot and cold here, with the complaints primarily surrounding price and poor service. as for the former, yes it is pricy ... but the price does include access to the tower, which is $18/person. factor that into the price of the meal and, depending on what you get, can be a pretty good deal. as for the service, i had no issues, except for the mechanical issue they were experiencing that prevented the restaurant from rotating until the very end of the meal.\n\ni had planned a lunch with a business colleague during my vegas vacation, i let him choose the location, and i picked this out of the options he suggested. he also suggested the lobster bisque and, as many other reviews have noted, it is heavenly. possibly the best soup i have ever had. for my entree i went for ultra-decadence with their \"<mark>The Ultra Burger</mark>\" topped with foie gras. <mark>The Ultra Burger</mark> itself is made from braised short rib, topped with a choice of cheese and a healthy portion of foie gras. my colleague ordered the ny steak served with a poached egg, and potato hash. it was something he had never ordered there before, but he had no complaints.\n\nmy only complaint is that there was no draft beer, and the bottled beer selection was weak. but their bread, served before the meal with three different types of spreads, was outstanding. that orange butter ... so so good. before tax and tip, and factoring out the $18 each for tower admission, the two meals, lobster bisque, and drinks were about $50, before tax and tip. (and since they are factoring in the price of tower admission in their meals, that's why they charge a minimum and a fee for splitting plates)\n\ndinner may not be as great of a value, but if you are dying to go up in the tower and are willing to pay the $18 admission, then imo you'd be crazy not to get lunch at top of the world. back out the $18 admission price and you are getting some really great lunch options for $8-$14. the food, and the view, are both well worth it.", 
            "came for lunch today, and i couldn't be more disappointed. our server was terrible, because she spent more time chatting with another waitress than she did her job. we waited 10 minutes to place our order, we had to ask for a drink menu 3 times, and we waited another 10 minutes after lunch to just ask for the check...because she never came back to see if we wanted another drink or dessert. we spent $150 on lunch, and it wasn't worth $40. the cheeseburgers were very dry and overcooked, but the short ribs on the bottom of <mark>The Ultra Burger</mark> was pretty good. too bad it was a very tiny piece of short ribs. overall, very disappointed and wouldn't recommend anyone waist their money there.", 
            "view was nice. food was just ok. ribs on <mark>The Ultra Burger</mark> (yes, actual ribs) were dry and hard to choke down. good service.", 
            "we visited the restaurant based on a lot of people's recommendations. and yes, it was worth it.\nwe went for lunch in saturday and the place was not too packed.\nthe view is pure amazing. reminds me of restaurants in the shard/london and paris. different views but same idea of lunch with a view. on top of the view comes the rotation, which is really really interesting. it takes 1 hour and 20 minutes for a full rotation, which is the effect time for a lunch.\n\ntheir food is as good as their view. the lobster bisque and their <mark>The Ultra Burger</mark> are memorable. in addition to their crab cake and steaks.\n\nskye was our waitress, and she was a funny and accommodating host.\n\nthanks !"

            "absolutely the best lunch value in all of las vegas in my opinion!  i try to visit every time i'm in town and have never been disappointed in any aspect of the service and food in all the years i've been going there.\n\nmost recently was last week, taking my 24yo daughter to vegas for the first time.  we planned our nice lunch for last friday.  and for the first time, i actually bought the discount tickets from tix4tonight - they have kiosks all about town.  for only a few bucks a coupon we got a 25% discount off each lunch!  and of course, if you have lunch at the stratosphere, your \"ride to the top\" is included - normally $20 a person.\n\nwe were greeted and promptly seated - the staff here are consistently pretty amazing.  and of course being a later lunch on a weekday, we got a window table so my daughter could take in the 80-minute, 2-mile long ride in a circle - just about the time it takes for a leisurely lunch and you get to see the entire skyline go by.\n\nfor starters we ordered the smoked atlantic salmon <mark><mark>Choice of Roasted Scottish Salmon or Free Range Chicken Breast</mark> Sandwich with Roasted Apple & Brie</mark> toast, with capers shallots and creme fraiche.  and as always, it did not disappoint.  simply superb.  my daughter isn't a big fan of salmon but this changed her mind!  she actually ate half the plate!  my only criticism is there's simply not enough toast.  four very small pieces is just not right.  i'd like to see them up the toast count... but we made do with the bread basket so it was just fine.\n\nfor our mains, i had the braised beef sort rib benedict and <mark>Braised Beef Short Rib Benedict & Crab Red Pepper Hollandaise</mark>, served over a four cheese potato cake, with 2 perfectly poached eggs, roasted carrots and green beans.  it was simply heaven on a plate... wonderful flavors, perfectly balanced.  the beef was \"melt in your mouth\" - so moist and tender it was just amazing.  jenny and i shared both our entre choices and she loved the benedict as much as i did.\n\nher choice was the lobster bisque and a twice baked potato.  i've never seen bisque served the way they do here - a nicely seasoned 1/4-cup pile of crab is in the bottom of the bowl when served, and the bisque is gently poured around it.  it was a tad sweet for my taste, but otherwise - like everything else - pretty amazing.  and the twice baked potato was huge!!  there was no way we could finish all of this wonderful food and boxes were't an option - pity, because i'd otherwise never leave leftovers of this quality behind.\n\nthe service was impeccable.  it's as if they all have a \"third eye\" and know when to attend and when to stay back.  we were never once interrupted in conversation, yet never left without refills or empty plates needing to be picked up.\n\nsure it's a tad spendy by some standards - but for less than $90 including 20% gratuity, my daughter had a lunch she won't soon forget.  we finished our visit by watching the crazy people jump off the tower (1,140 feet) and the other rides on the roof.\n\nthere's a reason they have a whole wall full of zagat and other awards for culinary excellence.\n\ngreat job top of the world.  i will be back."

            "the more sophisticated \"roller coaster\" of the stratosphere hotel. and i say this because the restaurant spins around the hotel at the top, giving you a 360 degree view of the city.\n\nvenue: we were escorted via elevator to the very top of the hotel. we stepped out, and were greeted and immediately sat at a table for two by the windows. as the circumference of the restaurant is ceiling-to-floor glass, and because it was 1pm in the afternoon, natural light just streamed in all around us. it was super bright yet, quiet and intimate. not too many tables at 1pm (on the 4th of july, no less), which meant 2-3 people were coming by to check on us and make sure we were comfortable. also as the restaurant spins around, you get a view of the people who are doing the bungee jump off the hotel. fun to watch and it didn't take away from the air of sophistication at all. \n\nfood/drink:\noh my heavens. if you decide to drink and enjoy sweet alcoholic beverages, please please please try the \"razz-jito.\" i ordered this per recommendation of our server, and it was fantastic. super delicious. my boyfriend ordered the \"mango madness\" and it was super strong (for me). i tasted more alcohol than anything and did not ask for a second sip.\nwe ordered off the lunch menu. we started with the lobster bisque. it was solid you can't really go wrong with this soupd.\ni got the <mark>Mediterranean Chopped Salad</mark> with lamb. the lamb was huge and salad portions were huge as well. pretty standard lamb choice but nothing to go through the roof about. salad was fresh and came with fried onions on top (myfavorite).\nthe bf ordered the seafood sandwich - a seemingly good choice. he stated that he liked everything in the sandwich but to have it combined in that way was not favorable. however, the sandwich was pretty big and came with these really neat looking potato chips. \nfood was okay, maybe we just weren't ordering the right stuff.\n\nservice:\nas stated in the first paragraph, service was awesome.  overall the view and service compensated for our food."

            "i think i had the best fettuccine alfredo of my life here.  the sauce was buttery and creamy and just excellent.  our first day in vegas, staying at the stratosphere, we decided to do lunch at this restaurant and get it out of our system.  we also opted to do lunch here over dinner figuring that we'd get a better price for lunch, and i believe we were right.\n\nthe view was incredible, however if you're not looking out over the strip, it is a bit boring and drab.  it's a desert, after all.  the most amusing part of the view was when the rides on the top hung over and we could see the people on the insanity... which was humorous alone since i noted to my companion \"you'd have to be insane to go on that\" before i knew the ride was actually titled insanity.  \n\nthe food was very good.  as i said, the best alfredo sauce ever.  and the <mark>Choice of Roasted Scottish Salmon or Free Range Chicken Breast</mark> on top were cooked to absolute perfection... i actually enjoyed the chicken more than the fettuccine.  i also ordered the fromage du jour from the drinks/dessert/appetizer menu, which i have to say i was a bit disappointed from.  the cheeses were mozzarella, which was excellent, a parmesan, which you can't really eat alone but worked great to crumble over my pasta, and a reggiano which smelled like ass and almost turned my stomach.  it tasted no better than it smelled either.  there was also some sort of compote on the plate that tainted some of the cheese and fruit.  \n\ni guess if i'd liked the compote it wouldn't have tainted anything, but i didn't care for it.  all in all the price wasn't too extravagant, but we did get one of the cheapest dishes on the menu at $14.  the staff was nice, the atmosphere incredible, so it's worth the 4 stars.",

(if you tend to be at all queasy with motion sickness this is not the spot for you!)\n\nthe food is pricy but what you would expect at a highly rated restaurant (zagat 23 out of 30 for food; voted lv best restaurant consistently, average 4.5 rating on tripadvisor, yelp, urbanspoon). yes, i do my homework before i commit to a dinner that potentially could cost over $200.  the ala carte side dish offerings are adequate, but the chicken (1 option) and seafood choices (4 options) were limited in my opinion. still they earned a star for having enough variety that we both found something easily.\n\nwe started off with soup.  while we waited the waiter brought a basket of warm bread that was very good.  we enjoyed the view and took some pictures, but after quite some time my husband asked whether they had to go out to get the lobster for my soup, it was taking so long.  about that time the waiter realized our soup had not come out and immediately brought it to our tables with appropriate apologies.  oops lost a star for that one.\n\nomg the lobster bisque is wonderful.  some of the best i have ever had.  my husband had the sotd which was a vegetable soup (can't remember the ingredients but it was made with pesto and a grain). very good also. add another star.\n\ni ordered: roasted \"loch etive\" scottish salmon with thai jungle curry foam* for $42 (description says \"from the deep scottish water sea inlet named \"etive,\" high in omega 3. kelp noodle salad with asian vinaigrette, peas and wild blueberries).  the salmon was grilled perfectly, flakey, moist and seasoned just enough.  i couldn't really discern the spices in the thai jungle curry foam, but the kelp noodle salad and dressing was tasty.  but the english peas were raw.  yes, raw.  read that hard, dry and not cooked at all.i tried to mash one with my fork and could not.  i commented to my waiter and he brought a plate to ask me to send a couple to the kitchen for the chef.  he also tried to squeeze one and it did not give.  a young man from the kitchen came out and apologized and said he would check with the chef about the intent of the peas. i hoped that he did not intend for them to be raw.  when the young man returned he informed me that the chef prepared the peas this way to give them crunch.  i don't like mushy peas and i do like them crispy and i know my peas and these were not \"crispy\" they were hard and inedible.  i don't know why but that's the truth. \n\nmy husband had the \"california mary's farm <mark>Choice of Roasted Scottish Salmon or Free Range Chicken Breast</mark> with lemon herb\" for $44 (included gnocchi with arugula pesto, english peas, roasted tomato and chicken jus) and the chicken was just delicious, but guess what! the peas in his dish were also raw. minus a star for the peas, but you get it back for the rest of the meal so its a wash.\n\nthe manager took off the cost of our haricot verts with roasted tomatoes (also very good) and so they won a star back .  overall my rating is 4 stars.  i will go back but won't make it a \"must\" on my next visit.", 
            "the view here is excellent and would be worth eating mcdonalds if that's what was served.  surprisingly great food that stands on it's own, regardless of the view.\n\nan ample steak-house like menu, but some great gourmet upgrades.  the foie gras appetizer leaves you wanting to order a second dish.  the lobster bisque is a meaty and hearty bowl, poured tableside.\n\nthe steak is grilled and a great marbled cut, while the <mark>Choice of Roasted Scottish Salmon or Free Range Chicken Breast</mark> was moist with a crispy skin and an amazing sauce.\n\nwhile you eat, the entire restaurant slowly rotates, taking about an hour to make a full rotation.  you'll be sure to see the skydivers jumping from the roof right past your window at some point of the tour.\n\na little bit pricey but considering it's vegas and you're floating up above the entire city, the meal is not a bad value.", 
            "i had dinner here for my birthday.  my entire experience with this restaurant was absolutely positive.  the host was very nice, informative, and accommodating.  we were able to sit next to a window, which had an amazing view of the city.  do note that the view of the strip is limited, but you get a 360 degree view of the city of las vegas (the restaurant spins - slowly).  the waiter was very friendly, attentive, and prompt <mark><mark>Choice of Roasted Scottish Salmon or Free Range Chicken Breast</mark> Sandwich with Roasted Apple & Brie</mark> us our drinks.  i ordered grilled organic chicken, which was very tender and succulent.  my boyfriend ordered the steak, and he said it was the best steak he has ever had - very tender and juicy.  there was an item that i didn't personally like, and i was surprised that (what i think was) the manager came out to check on us.  that just shows they really care about the customer's experience.  i would definitely recommend this restaurant, and i would definitely come back again.", 
            "absolutely the best lunch value in all of las vegas in my opinion!  i try to visit every time i'm in town and have never been disappointed in any aspect of the service and food in all the years i've been going there.\n\nmost recently was last week, taking my 24yo daughter to vegas for the first time.  we planned our nice lunch for last friday.  and for the first time, i actually bought the discount tickets from tix4tonight - they have kiosks all about town.  for only a few bucks a coupon we got a 25% discount off each lunch!  and of course, if you have lunch at the stratosphere, your \"ride to the top\" is included - normally $20 a person.\n\nwe were greeted and promptly seated - the staff here are consistently pretty amazing.  and of course being a later lunch on a weekday, we got a window table so my daughter could take in the 80-minute, 2-mile long ride in a circle - just about the time it takes for a leisurely lunch and you get to see the entire skyline go by.\n\nfor starters we ordered the smoked atlantic salmon <mark><mark>Choice of Roasted Scottish Salmon or Free Range Chicken Breast</mark> Sandwich with Roasted Apple & Brie</mark> toast, with capers shallots and creme fraiche.  and as always, it did not disappoint.  simply superb.  my daughter isn't a big fan of salmon but this changed her mind!  she actually ate half the plate!  my only criticism is there's simply not enough toast.  four very small pieces is just not right.  i'd like to see them up the toast count... but we made do with the bread basket so it was just fine.\n\nfor our mains, i had the braised beef sort rib benedict and <mark>Braised Beef Short Rib Benedict & Crab Red Pepper Hollandaise</mark>, served over a four cheese potato cake, with 2 perfectly poached eggs, roasted carrots and green beans.  it was simply heaven on a plate... wonderful flavors, perfectly balanced.  the beef was \"melt in your mouth\" - so moist and tender it was just amazing.  jenny and i shared both our entre choices and she loved the benedict as much as i did.\n\nher choice was the lobster bisque and a twice baked potato.  i've never seen bisque served the way they do here - a nicely seasoned 1/4-cup pile of crab is in the bottom of the bowl when served, and the bisque is gently poured around it.  it was a tad sweet for my taste, but otherwise - like everything else - pretty amazing.  and the twice baked potato was huge!!  there was no way we could finish all of this wonderful food and boxes were't an option - pity, because i'd otherwise never leave leftovers of this quality behind.\n\nthe service was impeccable.  it's as if they all have a \"third eye\" and know when to attend and when to stay back.  we were never once interrupted in conversation, yet never left without refills or empty plates needing to be picked up.\n\nsure it's a tad spendy by some standards - but for less than $90 including 20% gratuity, my daughter had a lunch she won't soon forget.  we finished our visit by watching the crazy people jump off the tower (1,140 feet) and the other rides on the roof.\n\nthere's a reason they have a whole wall full of zagat and other awards for culinary excellence.\n\ngreat job top of the world.  i will be back."

            "well i've only been here twice but it seems like that was enough times. we've only gone for lunch since it seems like you get the same food at half the price with the same view(which is kind of what you're paying for.) the service is good but the food itself leaves you expecting to have had more. the pastas are good, however, i like the pasta at the italian restaurant downstairs more. i've tried <mark>The Ultra Burger</mark> which were actually really good, however last time i had a philly cheese<mark>Grilled Wagyu Skirt Steak & Portobello Sandwich</mark> and it was a little on the small side. sure $15 isn't outrageous for a sandwich, you just expect it to be a slightly bigger size. also, last time we went, there was a woman who kept walking behind us so that she could take pictures outside the window. this isn't that bad, but when she kept doing it over and over for 10 minutes straight, eventually, we'd like to be able to enjoy the view rather than stare at her ass in our faces the whole time. i thought the staff could have really said something to her after she just wouldn't sit down. also, the fire alarm was set off downstairs while we were eating and it was going off for what was literally 10-15 minutes. this is a long time to have a very loud blaring alarm going off while you are paying for what i consider a classy restaraunt experience. the manager did come around to every table and apologize after about 5, minutes, and then came around again to every table to let us know that they were working on turning it off. that's nice, but after 15 minutes of not being able to hear each other speak and having this blaring alarm in our ears, i really thought we could expect some kind of discount. 10% or at least a free drink. i understand you can't go around looking for free stuff all the time, but when you're paying for a classy experience and as your food arrives you have to sit there and listen to a fire alarm going off right next your ears(it wasn't in the room over or somewhere far away, it was loud, and in the dining area), you'd expect something, right? well we didn't get anything comped which was surprising for how bad our experience was, and then we had to wait 10 minutes for the elevators to start working again since they shut off automatically when the fire alarm goes off. we thought about going upstairs to walk around but when we saw the crowd of people on the observation deck waiting for an elevator, we walked back down to wait in their lounge area. i'm not saying this place is bad, i just think for the price you could definitely get better, and you don't wan't to know what it's like to pay $25-$30 a person to get front row tickets to the fire alarm concert.", 
            "the food is just ok.  we tried the lobster bisque that everyone seemed to rave about was disappointing.  just a weird mix of flavors.  the tuna tataki and calamari were ok.  the faltiron <mark>Grilled Wagyu Skirt Steak & Portobello Sandwich</mark> was also just ok.  \n\nof course the rotating view is very nice but there are so many other fantastic places to dine in vegas and get way more bang for your buck.",

            "still coming off of my 'joe's seafood prime steak and stone crabs' dinner, i was weary of what meal was ahead of us.  we decide to check out top of the world for lunch. \n\ni really enjoyed our meal here.  my husband and i both choose the premiere tasting menu ($36).  we both enjoyed salads as starters instead of the lobster bisque.  the salad was delicious. light, flavorful, crisp, and well portioned.  for our second course i opt for the steak and crab cakes; my husband gets the steak with the lobster tail.  we really enjoyed the crab cakes <mark>Seafood Frittata with Scallop, Shrimp and Lobster</mark>, but our steak was not cooked to our liking.  we both ordered them 'medium', and got them at medium-well.  and they're pretty tricky by sitting it on top of a mini portabella...making me think i have more meat than i really do.  lastly the dessert.  excellent array of raspberry mousse, bread pudding, and chocolate cake.\n\nthe service at top of the world was excellent.  one thing i found amusing was our host had under his name: compton hills, ca (all employees have a notation of where they're from).  compton hills, ca.....highly suspect. haha.  the view is spectacular, and the food is good.  i wouldn't put it on my list of 'must-haves' in vegas, but maybe 'must try at least once'.", 
            "i have eaten there twice and was never disappointed. while the prices are very, very high, i felt i got what i paid for through and through. i ordered the filet mignon <mark>Seafood Frittata with Scallop, Shrimp and Lobster</mark> tail, and let me tell you, the lobster tail was the most tender i had ever experienced outside of boston. \ntheir cocktails are so so, you really have to ask for premium liquor to get a buzz on. \nservice is fast and very, very professional. it will be a routine stop every single time i go back to vegas.", 
            "first of all, the service here was excellent.  a server that can sit along side with me after our wine was served and before our appetizer was ready to share photos of our puppies is surely a moment of good interaction vs. scripted menu specials and courtesy calls like\"how is that wine?\" when they really don't give a damn...  eventhough, this flamboyant waitor still gave good recommendations, after our moment, i trusted him fully.\n\nwe both started with our own lobster bisque.  it was spectacular.  no black pepper needed, just fyi if the server asks if you would like some black pepper with that, say no! \n\ni had the black cod and my man had the filet.  his steak was cooked perfect.  it was so tender and flavorful. my fish on the other hand was only so so.  it was moist, and the fish was fresh, but somehow the fish loss its flavor.  i wouldn't order this again.\n\ntheir dessert menu was in very small portions, so even after our very satisfied meals, we were able to try the cheesecake trio and the chocolate creme brulee.  the bf loved the cheesecake, which was on a stick like a lollipop which you dip in different flavor sides, his favorite was the oreo.  \n\nthe view was amazing, we sat there front early evening when the sun was still out until night and saw the restaurant just transform.  from full of light and open space and windows as walls that we face from the table where we were sat.  to dim lights insdie so that the las vegas city strip lights are still considered bright.  i have not stepped into the stratosphere for the hotel or casino, but will definitely come back to this restaurant again.  next time, i want to have their steak <mark>Seafood Frittata with Scallop, Shrimp and Lobster</mark> combo!\n\ngreat wine selection.\n\nonce in a while a bungee jumper will be in sight while he/she drops off the side of the building.  \n\nthe restaurants rotates very slowly so you get a different view every minute. \n\ngreat staff, even the manager of the restaurant gets around to almost every table to chat a bit.  excellent service from beginning to end.",

            "i went here just yesterday for dinner to celebrate my boyfriend's birthday. for a quick summary, here are my thoughts:\n-view: 5 stars.\n-ambience: 3 stars\n-service/wait time: 3 stars\n-food: 3 stars\n\nand for more in-depth explanation:\n\nview:\nit's a view 800ft above the ground overlooking the strip. and it rotates. it is just as amazing and breathtaking as you would expect. we requested a seat by the giant floor to ceiling windows, which made it even better. we also saw 5 different people jump  for the stratosphere sky jump, which was great fun to watch. if you want to go somewhere with a great view, this can't be beat.\n\nambience:\ndespite the gorgeous view, the restaurant's ambience was lacking. the decor (table setting, furniture, lighting) appeared very outdated and did not give a sense of elegance. the lighting was especially weak. it did not give the kind of ambience that so many restaurants in la give. if you take away the amazing view and just look at the restaurant in general, i guarantee anyone would be severely disappointed. in addition, the restaurant's website said the business casual dress code was \"strictly enforced\", yet i saw people wearing shorts, flip-flops and tank tops. my boyfriend and i got dressed up for the night and wanted to go somewhere fancy. i think it just really kills the mood and feeling of extravagance when you look behind you and some guy is in a wife beater.\n\nservice:\nwe got there at exactly 6:30pm (our reservation time) and was seated right away. however, the hostess brought us to a table that wasn't right next to the window, so we asked to be moved. she said it would be a 20 minute wait, which we agreed to. during the wait, we went upstairs to the bar/lounge area, which was nice. it wasn't busy at all but it happened to be happy hour and we got a 2-for-1 deal on a delicious margarita (some type of orange flavor with pop rocks!). anyways, we waited for a while and enjoyed the view from the lounge, but then 20 minutes became 30 which then became 40! we finally went back down and they apologized for the long wait and led us to a window table right away. our waiter was friendly and helpful - not exemplary but certainly not bad. however, our food took another 40 minutes to prepare!! i definitely did not expect that long of a wait and was severely disappointed at that (especially because the restaurant was not busy at all. i saw at least 4 empty tables around ours). overall, the service was fine but the wait time (especially on a slow night) was awful. however, keep in mind that we went there with a $25 gift certificate, which might have affected our service? if so, that is pretty dishonorable. \n\nfood:\nthe complimentary bread/butter they gave was delicious. they give you a plate of three different kinds of butter (regular, garlic, and marmalade) which was awesome and was actually my favorite food of the night (whether that' s a good or bad thing - you decide).\n\nmy boyfriend had the 10oz. usda choice filet with red wine mushroom sauce for $53. the portion was quite small and all he had was literally the piece of steak and that was it. no vegetables or anything. the steak itself was good (i had a piece) - tender and juicy. however, it is nowhere near the best steak i've ever eaten and, in my opinion, not worth the price at all! lala's argentine grill in west hollywood, ca has significantly better steaks for around $20.\n\ni had the fettuccine seafood alfredo <mark>Seafood Frittata with Scallop, Shrimp and Lobster</mark>, prawns and scallops or $40. it was only okay. honestly, i've had better pasta at casual restaurants like cpk and bj's for around $20 (baby clam linguini with lemon cream sauce at cpk or the spaghettini with fresh clams at the grand lux cafe in the palazzo are significantly better). the sauce was not creamy and actually kind of cold right at the start. some of the pasta was even hard/undercooked. however, the prawns and scallops were a hearty size and cooked very well. my plate only had one piece of lobster though, and that was dry and almost tasteless.\n\nso, overall, if you want to go for the view - do it, because the view is amazing. however, i felt the food was not worth the price at all and really regret going there. if you have the money to spend, do it. otherwise, tell them you just want to go up to the lounge, not the restaurant. you'll still get to go up the tower and see the view and if it's happy hour,you get 2-for-1 martinis! then, take the money you save and go to the rio seafood buffet and eat to your heart's content.", 
            "over hyped, over expensive food. i'm a true believer that good food should not cost an arm and a leg. but if its expensive it should taste better than olive garden. i had the lobster bisque which tasted good during the first 5 spoon fulls but become too rich for a large bowl ($12). for entree, i ordered the seafood alfredo <mark>Seafood Frittata with Scallop, Shrimp and Lobster</mark>, prawns and scallops. lobster was overcooked and i only found 2 chunks ($45). the pasta tasted like whole wheat pasta and i'm pretty sure the menu did not state whole wheat. i sampled my friend's salmon dish ($40) and it tasted overcooked and dried out. i also tried the foie gras tater tots ($11) which tasted more like mediocre hush puppies than anything like foie gras. the mini desserts trio are not even worth mentioning. i was really looking forward to the meal and its sad that i prefer olive garden over this place. yes, the view is pretty awesome and its rotating. but you can pay $16 to check out the view and walk around it slowly if you want to simulate the rotating view. there are so many better options on/off the strip!\n\nif you like thrill rides, check out big shot, insanity and x scream. price of tickets include admission to the top of the tower.\n\nif you don't believe me that this place is overpriced compare the lunch menu to the dinner menu. the same entrees on the lunch menu are double in price on the dinner menu. \n\ndon't fall for this tourist trap!",

            "to go up to the observation deck at the stratosphere is $16 each so we decided to go up and have lunch instead. my husband had the salmon caeser salad and a bowl of lobster bisque and i had the 3 course lunch tasting and our bill came in $50-ish. seeing as we would have spent $32 just for the view i felt this was a good value and we spent over an hour there. we were wearing jeans and i didn't feel under dressed for lunch there at all. \n\nthe food was great and the restaurant was not too busy at all so we had a great time. if you are a fan of lobster bisque you have to try their version of it--it's amazing! we all had it and loved it. it was the best thing i ate in vegas period. i chose salmon as my entree and there was a trio of desserts. one of them was the banana bread pudding and i would say it also makes the list of one of the other best things i ate. \n\nmy mom did the $37 trio and had steak <mark>Seafood Frittata with Scallop, Shrimp and Lobster</mark> tail as her entree. it was a pretty small amount of lobster but it was lunch and she said the steak was really good. she also ordered a sangria and i had a sip it was pretty tasty but not worth $13 in my opinion. \n\nbottom line: go for a nice lunch and you won't be sorry!", 
            "had a great early dinner here on our first day of my vegas vacation with my bf! totally made reservations via yelp and opentable & even better: got a good deal with restaurant.com!! \n\nwe had just finished doing the xscream & insanity rides atop the stratosphere, so the view did not bother us at all. plus, we're used to the rotating restaurant theme because of the top of waikiki restaurant here at home! \n\nfirst of all, we had originally planned on going back to our hotel to change for dinner, but we stayed at the luxor and that would've been an hour or so situation - so we chanced it and went in our casual attire (tank and denim skirt for me, t shirt and cargo shorts for him) - we were told that they had just changed their dress code policy to where men have to wear collared shirts, but they had extra ones in the back. so they brought out a huge mustardy colored shirt - it looked like it was a doorman's shirt from the hotel. it was a little big, but the color wasn't so bad on him. \n\nanyway, we got seated and our waitress ellen, was the best! right from the get-go, she was very nice and friendly - we never felt out of place, despite our wardrobe. her assistant (i feel so bad, i can't remember his name), was very nice also. i believe my bf ordered the prime rib and i got the seafood fettuccine alfredo. we were also served a bread basket with 3 different butters - the breads were soo delicious! it included sourdough, flat bread, and a cheddar cheese bread - we ate so much of it!! \n\nmy alfredo was very good - it had shrimp, scallops, <mark>Seafood Frittata with Scallop, Shrimp and Lobster</mark>. i'm glad that the fettuccine noodles were green, it made my dish look so much more appetizing than having plain white/yellow noodles! my bf enjoyed his prime rib, and i did have a taste - it was good!! we were too stuffed for dessert, but from what i saw - it didn't look that good. \n\nyou are able to see people doing the jump over the stratosphere (they whiz by really fast), and you can also see the front of the xscream dip down during your meal - some people seemed a little stressed to see all of that, but it didn't bother us! i'm sure a meal here would be soo much better and romantic after the sun goes down and all of the lights from the hotels are in full effect, but we still enjoyed our dinner.", 
            "we went here for lunch because we wanted to go to the top but we didn't want to stand in line or pay for the observation deck (very cool that the elevator ride up is included in the restaurant price). be prepared to take off all metal items before getting on the elevator [annoying!].\n\nthe view was lovely and rotated over our lunch experience. watching the sky-jumpers was highly entertaining.\n\nthe pre-meal bread came with three lovely flavored butters, yay! (pesto, regular butter, and tangerine flavors)\n\ni ordered the lobster bisque and sea bass. the bisque was acceptable tasting (not better than target's lobster bisque) but the sea bass was not. it was a cheap cut of fish, not real sea bass, outrageous! not what they showed in the pictures at the reservation desk. fishy tasting in a bad way. :( !!!\n\ni also tried the salmon <mark>Seafood Frittata with Scallop, Shrimp and Lobster</mark> mac and cheese from others at my table; those were nice and delicious. burgers also a good choice here.\n\nservice was average from the waitstaff.\n\nelevator attendant told us afterwards the restaurant experience came with observation deck time, above the restaurant - wish we had known.\n-----\nin summary, dot not get the sea bass but there are other palatable options. the view was great, and it is a better value to eat here and go up the private elevator than to just buy an observation deck pass.", 
            "hmm, we have something similar here in honolulu, but no where as high. \nour first time eating here with our 50 dollar restaurant.com certificate. the waitresses and waiters here are so professional and friendly. \ni was given a dodo color orange collard shirt to wear over my tshirt because we didn't know they had a dress code lol. i can't complain though, most high class restaurants will tell you \"sorry come back later\" but they were cool about it. \nhands down the best complimentary bread and butter assortment i've ever had. 3 different breads/crackers and butters. shit, i couldv'e ate just that and be happy :) \ni had the ny steak i think? i forget because we ate so damn much on our trip to vegas lol. anyways it was some beef, but was mmm mmm good. gfs pasta was good too with huge pieces of <mark>Seafood Frittata with Scallop, Shrimp and Lobster</mark>. \nthanks for the great service and friendly attitudes top of the world staff. :)\nwould return to eat here on my next trip to vegas again!\nvisited aug 2011", 
            "went here on our anniversary and was super impressed. we both did the 4 course meal. \n\nfirst, the view was amazing. we planned it so we would be able to watch the sun come down, which was just gorgeous! there was people doing the bungee jumping, and it was really fun to watch them fly by the windows.  \n\nfor my meal, i started off <mark>Seafood Frittata with Scallop, Shrimp and Lobster</mark> bisque soup, which was delicious. the waiter brought me a bowl full of lobster meat, and pouring in the cream in front of me. the second course was a sea bass on bok choy, very fresh. my main course i chose the was a steak, which was amazing. the dessert was almost too much. they brought each of us a plate of 4 different mini desserts. i couldn't even eat it all, despite how tasty it was. \n\nour waiter was very friendly, on top of his job. my only complaint is i kept getting lost finding the bathroom lol. but other then that, amazing food and experience!", 
            "so i visited this place tonight... and after everything was done i was only somewhat unimpressed.... first off, i did not have a reservation and was told by locals that because of the high $$$$ as long as its not on the weekend you can do a walk in due to the fact that the restaurant is mainly used by tourist. upon getting there i had to endure a 20-30 minute wait. although when we were seated, i saw many empty tables which made me believe that the \"wait time\" was done on purpose to give the illusion that its full. on to the food, the only thing i would highly recommend is their lobster bisque soup, which was delicious! i ordered the pork sirloin ($50) and my girlfriend ordered the steak (10 oz) <mark>Seafood Frittata with Scallop, Shrimp and Lobster</mark> tail ($79). to me the food portions were small and did not come with any sides. to me the price doesn't justify the quantity. by the way the mixed drinks were very \"light\" on liquor... but your paying a premium price of about $13-$15 bucks for a mixed drink. overall my total bill was $214... and while the view is remarkable i probably wont be back again unless its a really important occasion... and even that is something i'd have to give serious thought about doing.", 
            "my husband and i planned on eloping in las vegas (see my review for the little white wedding chapel) and in preparation i made a reservation at the top of the world a few months in advance.  this was to be our big celebration dinner the night after we married.  i requested a window seat, of course, which i was nervous we may not get but hoped for the best.  \n\nthe night of our dinner we dressed to the nines and barely ate all day so we could save our appetite.  when we arrived we did have to wait a little longer than i hoped considering we had an 8:45 p.m. reservation.  we went to the lounge which is on another floor, grabbed a drink, then headed out to the observation deck to see what all the fuss is about.  it really is a fantastic view.  \n\nthe reason i can't give a five star review is because in addition to our wait, when our buzzer went off we simply couldn't find our way back to the restaurant!  the lounge is on a different floor and the bartender's directions were very obscure.  i don't know how we did it but we did.   i know it sounds silly but it honestly was not easy to navigate :o)  \n\nthe food, service and wine, however, is five star.  the prices were a little intimidating because we are by no means \"fancy.\"  in fact, we were nervous that we would act too silly or that our manners may be sub par hahaha.  the server (i wish i could remember his name) was great.  we started with oysters <mark>Seafood Frittata with Scallop, Shrimp and Lobster</mark> bisque.  very fresh and very, very tasty.  i'm from new england so i consider myself fairly educated on what is good seafood.  \n\nmy husband got the filet and alaskan crab leg while i got the filet <mark>Seafood Frittata with Scallop, Shrimp and Lobster</mark> tail.  perfectly cooked.  absolutely delicious.  the menu offers wine suggestions for each dish, which we went with because we are not experts on wine and food pairings.  they were spot on.  the meal was so savory, we were very happy.  \n\nwith the food aside, the restaurant itself was incredible.  oh, we did get that window seat, by the way :o)   we were there for nearly two hours (not because of service, we wanted to take our time, which they didn't seem to mind at all) and because the restaurant floor rotates 360 degrees every hour or so, we got the most fantastic, romantic view of the strip.  the only thing (and they do warn you) that was a little odd was the jumpers dropping from the top of the stratosphere outside of the window.  honestly, we thought it was funny.  \n\noverall i had a wonderful time.  the food was delicious and the staff was great.  one of the managers was adorable; he came over to thank my husband for bringing \"such a beautiful young lady into the restaurant.\"  maybe he was just buttering us up but it worked haha.  very beautiful, very romantic and tasty.", 
            "amazing atmosphere and ambiance. the restaurant is truly on top of the world. it was a revolving restaurant on the 106th floor. the service and food were top notch. there was 6 in our group. \nitems ordered were:\n2 mexican prawns, scallops <mark>Seafood Frittata with Scallop, Shrimp and Lobster</mark> grilled on a panache with a couscous type tanouleh. exquisite\nseafood fettuccini \nrib eye steak x 2\nrack of lamb. very tender and just right \nwe shared sides of creamy polenta with creme fraiche\nand omg to die for gnocchi which had brown butter on top. yummy. my mouth is drooling as i type. we also got a side of saut\\u00e9ed mushrooms with parsley and garlic. \nthis too was delish. the portions were surprisingly huge. we all had leftovers and had no room for desert. \nwe watched people dive from the insanity ride from the floor above us and enjoyed the breathtaking views of las vegas at night. our waitress karen was very sweet funny and kept on checking in on us every few minutes. \nhighly recommended.  will definitely go back when i visit vegas in the near future.", 
            "the view was definitely the best part of the meal.  which is not to say the food is terrible, but it definitely isn't great.  i got the ny strip and my friend got the ribeye.  we both ordered them medium rare but they came out more medium than medium rare.  which wasn't terrible, but not what we ordered either and for 50 bucks a steak you should get it as you want it.  my fiance got the prawns, scallops <mark>Seafood Frittata with Scallop, Shrimp and Lobster</mark> and thought it was good but not great.  and my friend's wife got the center cut filet which she enjoyed.  \n\nall in all it wasn't a bad dining experience, just for the price i feel there are better restaurants on the strip.  but the view is amazing.", 
            "this restaurant has a stunning view of las vegas, and makes a full rotation in about an hour, so every spot has an amazing view.  the sections are numbered, which is helpful to find your table if you leave to wash your hands or whatnot.  the rotation of the restaurant is slow so don't worry about getting sick or dizzy. i've been in rotating restaurants before that spun too fast, which isn't fun when you're trying to enjoy a good meal.\n\nwe started our meal with the market greens salad:  tomatoes, fennel, roasted beets, with balsamic vinaigrette on top.  the salad is held together with thick strips of fresh, crunchy cucumber.  delicious.\n\nfor dinner i had the large mexican prawns, new england scallops & lobster a la plancha with roasted cauliflower salad with red bell pepper, golden raisins and capers, moorish tomato sauce and chive oil.  i had never had lobster a la plancha before, and this was simply amazing.\n\nmy husband ordered the fettuccine seafood alfredo <mark>Seafood Frittata with Scallop, Shrimp and Lobster</mark>, prawns & scallops with artisanal pasta, teardrop tomatoes, parmesan reggiano, garlic, parsley and basil.  the alfredo sauce wasn't too heavy which is nice and flavorful.\n\nfor dessert, everything looked amazing but we finally chose the lemon cheesecake with white chocolate shavings.  tarty and thick, this cheesecake was amazing.\n\nthis restaurant is perfect for a romantic dinner to celebrate a special occasion.  business casual attire is required, so don't try to come here in flip flops and shorts.  i would also recommend getting a reservation so you can guarantee you'll get a spot by the window.", 
            "nothing like fine dining in las vegas and what better than to have dinner in the highest structure on the strip. the elevator ride to the top of the tower is free if you have a meal at top of the world. you are free to roam the observation deck once you are done with your meal.\n\nthe food here was excellent. along with the view and the dimly lit setting, this place is very romantic and quite the place to visit if you are trying to impress someone.\n\nthe menu when i visited was different that it was now. when i dined here, the menu had a three course tasting featuring chateubriand for two. we started the meal <mark>Seafood Frittata with Scallop, Shrimp and Lobster</mark> bisque. the soup was tasty and full of lobster flavor. the chateubriand was carved tableside and was cooked to perfection. we finished the meal with a chocolate tower resembling the stratosphere tower.\n\nservice was spot on with our food coming out as soon as the previous dish was completed.", 
            "love the view. lobster bisque <mark>Seafood Frittata with Scallop, Shrimp and Lobster</mark> grilled cheese were both good as was the steak. the dessert trio was the high light very nice presentation. the view and service is what earned top of the world a 4 star rating. over all a nice lunch, but there are so many better restaurants in vegas and it's only a few times a year i visit so i'm glad i was able to experience this place, but probably will not be back.", 
            "the husband and i had dinner here the first night we were in town. he told me the ambiance would be amazing with the vegas skyline and subtle rotation. usually restaurants that have a gimmicky atmosphere have subpar food. oh boy did the food here blow other restaurants out of the water! we ordered the rack of lamb and one 4 course meal to share.\n\nthe staff was friendly and attentive. they gave us recommendations on what to order and advised perfectly. \n\nwe started with bread, which was amazing! it was fresh and came with 3 flavored butters. the orange one was my favorite! \n\nlobster bisque - oh so tasty and filled <mark>Seafood Frittata with Scallop, Shrimp and Lobster</mark>. waiter served it table side to show how much lobster is actually in the bisque.\n\nbranzino - perfectly seared and delicious!\n\nsteak - perfectly cooked as we asked and tasty, but the rack of lamb seriously outshined this.\n\nrack of lamb - absolutely orgasmic!!!! i started with this while the hubs ate the steak so we could switch off and i told him i needed to finish with this. the mint sauce was great and we each had 2 pieces. a very generous portion.\n\ndessert that came with the 4 course meal was good, but seriously that rack of lamb. mmmmmm!\n\nat one point during dinner you rotate to where bungee jumpers are falling from above (keep in mind we are on the 107th(?) floor). it's pretty entertaining.\n\nwe went out to the observation deck after dinner and it was a great way to end the night. worth every penny. wonderful service, atmosphere and food!", 
            "eating here was the best meal i've ever had. the appetizer was lobster soup. they pour the soup from a gravy boat into a bowl with minced lobster. it was delicious. my main course was a steak <mark>Seafood Frittata with Scallop, Shrimp and Lobster</mark> with mushroom. the mushroom was everything i thought it would be and was gone in seconds. the steak was so filling with a sauce and chopped mushrooms on top. it fills you up but still leaves enough room for the lobster and dessert. the lobster was your sea food, well presented and easy to eat. nothing but amazingly delicious. after that was dessert, chocolate mouse with white chocolate and an edible cup with berries and cream. the price was well worth it. did i mention you eat at 1,060ft up. and the restaurant rotates so you get every angle of the view.", 
            "ok i admit, the view is breathtaking. the fact that it was a 360deg view was just amazing. being surrounded by the night time view so las vegas... i was in awe. but the food is a different story. \n\nwe came in a large party so i got to try a few things. the general consensus is that the food is good quality, but poorly poorly executed. i ordered the seafood dish and my scallops, shrimp, <mark>Seafood Frittata with Scallop, Shrimp and Lobster</mark> were all overlooked. it was tasty enough so i still enjoyed it, but for the hefty price tag i expected it to be cooked perfectly. almost everyone else in my party ordered steaks.  i tried the filet and it was very tender, but unevenly cooked. everyone commented that their steak was either overlooked or undercooked. we didn't figure it out until the end that they must have switched up all our orders - a detrimental mistake. my poor little cousin got my boyfriend's rare+ steak. at the end he said it sucked cause his cow was still bleeding! we were pretty upset at this point, but there wasn't much we could do. my sister ordered a steak with foie gras on the side and it was horrible. nothing like foie gras i've had before. the sides were good.\n\nlike most restaurants with an amazing view, the food was just ok. i'm glad i came here once to see the view, but i wouldn't come again. there is also a lounge above the restaurant. so if you want to see the view without splurging $50-80 per entree for dinner, ride the elevator straight to the lounge! you can also go outside where there are telescopes and rides. \n\nthey had a photographer come around and take pictures for us, which i thought was cool! i thought they would post it somewhere, but silly me! of course they are for sale. guess how much a picture costs?? $60!!!", 
            "i had a strange experience coming here. something i wouldn't expect from a high class restaurant. \n\ni was a walk in on a weekday during february. when i checked in upstairs, another guest came out of the restaurant wanting a different seat, i was told i was set and to take a seat by the elevators. people came in and out of the restaurant (i figured guests with reservations) and i waited about 20 mins until the host looked at me and said, \"do you need help? oh, no wait, you ate already\". i answered,  \"no, i checked in a while ago, you told me to sit here\". the host apologized and searched my name in the system not knowing what happened. i made the excuse for them, \"that guest that wanted different seats must have distracted the check in process, it happens\". so, they made a big deal to get me a \"good seat\" (by the window - at the hotel i was staying at... with a view i've seen several times on this trip...that i mentioned when i checked in).\n\nthe view was gorgeous none-the-less but as soon as i sat down, a waiter dropped a plate of food, picking up only the big pieces. \n\ni ordered a glass of wine, the lobster bisque and steak <mark>Seafood Frittata with Scallop, Shrimp and Lobster</mark>. \nthe lobster bisque was devine though some parts of the meat were cold while other parts were warm. and the steak <mark>Seafood Frittata with Scallop, Shrimp and Lobster</mark> was perfect as well. \n\nwhile i was eating, my water was never filled and a different waitress broke a wine glass (again, only picking up the big pieces). while enjoying the food and view all the waiters (3 in our area) are speaking on the different restaurant levels in spanish rather loudly. \n\nwhen i was done, the waitress that broke the glass asked if i was done and when i said yes, she took my plate away which i thought was strange. i had quite a bit of food left and i felt like for a place like this, wasting food wouldn't be an option. (i would have loved to finish left overs!)\n\nwhile waiting for check, my waiter was bringing food to another table where he dropped the food cover. \n\ni thought this restaurant staff was very careless and i left uneasy about my experience.", 
            "my review is for my visit on 02/22/2014. we had reservations for a party of 12 on saturday at 8pm. when we got there, the view was spectacular but that's the only positive thing i can say about my visit. the food was terrible! i got the \"surf and turf gnochi <mark>Seafood Frittata with Scallop, Shrimp and Lobster</mark> and braised beef short rib\" and was promptly disappointed with my meal. the pasta flavor was extra \"fishy\" and was really not a good combination to have the beef short rib added. whoever thought this was a good way to combine the meal, needs to rethink their taste buds...seriously. \n\nwhat was even more disappointing was my husband's meal. he wanted to stay away from seafood and stick to pasta and chicken, so the waiter said that he could do the \"fettuccine seafood alfredo <mark>Seafood Frittata with Scallop, Shrimp and Lobster</mark>, prawns & scallops\" from the menu, no seafood, and replace with chicken. both my sister-in-law and my husband ordered the waiter's suggestion. when my husband and sister-in-law got his meal, however, it was as if the chef removed the scallops and slapped some chicken on top of it. the meal was fishy, exactly what we were trying to avoid. when we spoke with the waiter about the matter, he said that there was no way the meal had any seafood. what?! the waiter made both my sister-in-law and husband look like liars; very embarrassing in front of our large group of friends. and to top it all off, the waiter did not even bother calling his manager for assistance or replacing the meal with something else. so practically, we were stuck paying for a meal that we did not eat. and you call this fine dining? i don't think so!\n\nand finally, the entire group and i were pretty upset when we noticed that directly across from us was a table with a group as big as ours receiving totally different service than we were just because there was some type of minor league baseball player in their group. the manager was showing them their different champagnes, catering to their every need. how is that fair? shouldn't all the customers receive the same service? \n\nin conclusion, i would only recommend this place for their view, but definitely not for a nice dining experience!", 
            "top of the world!!!! that's what it felt like because of the view.  a beautiful view of las vegas.   the awesome part was that we were able to see every perspective of vegas without leaving our table because the restaurant rotates as you eat.  the food was good.  my 10 oz steak was cooked to perfection.  the steak was tender and melted in my mouth.  also tried the gnocchi <mark>Seafood Frittata with Scallop, Shrimp and Lobster</mark> and braised beef short ribs.   that was ok.  for dessert,  banana foster in a caramel and almond box.  delicious!!! what a great way to end the meal.  overall great experience! the service was good.  awesome view. good food!  definitely must check out.", 
            "beautiful views, amazing service and awesome food!  the four course tasting menu <mark>Seafood Frittata with Scallop, Shrimp and Lobster</mark> bisque soup, black cod, filet and two desserts is beyond awesome and large enough to share with another person!  this with bottle of wine was only $165 whereas some places in vegas would charge you 500 - 600 and would not have the view nor quality of food and service!", 
            "amazing meal. \n\n1) we ordered the crab cake appetizer. i was honestly a little surprised that it wasn't hotter, but it was sooo tasty. we also both ordered cocktails recommended by our server, which were absolutely delicious and light \n\n2) lobster bisque. they serve it as a bowl <mark>Seafood Frittata with Scallop, Shrimp and Lobster</mark> in the middle and pour the bisque over. it was very succulent. we were thinking each thinking about getting our own but decided to share, which i'm very glad we did. the portion was very generous and the perfect precursor to our meal\n\n3) rack of lamb. oh, my, goodness. this was incredible. i ordered it medium and it literally melted in my mouth. it came with a side of chutney which was the perfect accompaniment. i was full half way but couldn't help but eat the whole plate. that is not the kind of meal you waste. \n\n4) bone-in rib-eye. ridiculous. there are no words for how delectable this was. hubby made a good choice. im his words, \"even the fat is good,\"..that's saying something \n\nwe also did the wine pairings suggested with each part of the meal which i highly recommend.  and honestly, the view is everything they say it is..incredible.  but the best part, my guy proposed to me during dessert!  i wouldn't have changed a thing!",

( i prefer a fire charred steak)  we shared a huge twice baked potato (very good) and field greens salad. i ordered the lobster bisque (not bad, i've eaten better) and the prawns, scallops <mark>Seafood Frittata with Scallop, Shrimp and Lobster</mark> plate. the roasted salad and the scallops were very good, that's where it stopped. the lobster and the shrimp had a little bit of foul fishy taste. i could not identify it at the time but the other day i was eating crab legs and took a bite of the shoulder meat, there's that the taste i remember. we will not be back for the food, but if we book a room we may have a drink at the bar for the view.(fantastic view)  there are much  better restaurants in town for the same prices. i give the view 5 stars.",

            "if you want a fine dining experience in beautiful las vegas, this is the place to go.  i always wanted to dine on top of  the world and watch the city lights from below.  we came here around 4 pm, planning to make a reservation for 6 pm, while we spent time doing the crazy rides.  the lady at the booth helped us make our reservation and allowed us to bypass the security lines for the rides since we were their guest.  upon checking in and requesting a window seat, the hostess said she would send us a text when our table was ready while we waited at the observation deck bar.  \n\nthe hostess did hook us up as we got a nice table overlooking the strip.  our waiter was friendly and came often to refill our drinks.  we shared a lobster bisque as our appetizer and the waiter even offered to give us two bowls.  the bisque was amazing and creamy.  we also got delicious bread with 3 types of butter.  i think it was normal butter, basil butter and mango butter.  for my entree, i ordered a seafood dish that had shrimp, scallop <mark>Seafood Frittata with Scallop, Shrimp and Lobster</mark> with a side of vegetables. i can't quite remember, but it was delicious, just a tad bit salty.  it was definitely portioned a lot better than the lobster tail i ordered at alexander's that left me feeling unfulfilled.\n\nthe restaurant rotated slowly so that you could see the view of the strip.  it was romantic and refreshing.  my boyfriend joked that if he had a ring, it would have been the perfect place to propose.  we were full by the end of the night, so did not opt for any expensive dessert (especially since they no longer carried the delicious tiramisu that i read about).  when we inquired about any birthday dessert, they did bring out a little lava brownie, which was cute.  it was the perfect dinner to have before watching le reve.",

(gnocchi was a little grainy/too soft and squishy.)  kids' filet, while a neat idea, was $30 for a 5 oz cut.  wife liked her cobia and crab cake (a little too much garnish on crab cake for her taste.)  pork belly appetizer was pretty good.\n\nviews are great (go about an hour before sunset and watch the day turn to night), our kids were well-behaved (and complimented, always cool) and the drinks are good (wife loved the blueberry martini and the sangria is good.)\n\nit's pretty fucking pricey but you are paying for the experience.",

            "i have been dining here almost since day 1 and can honestly say i have never been disappointed  (however i do miss debbie, my requested server for so many years). the girlfriend and i both had the fillet migon medium rare, hers was more medium but far from a deal breaker. the scallops, lobster, <mark>Seafood Frittata with Scallop, Shrimp and Lobster</mark> bisque were spot on.  a member of our party was a first timer. he is no stranger to steaks, both store bought and self cured as a hunter. he ordered the rib eye and quote \"that is the best steak i have ever had\".  do i even need to mention the view?"

            "my wife and i decided to choose this restaurant for our one year anniversary dinner and we definitely made a great choice! we were a little nervous about how most people say that restaurants with a great view usually don't have food to match the view, but this restaurant is not the case. best view in vegas and delicious food to go along with it.  we had 7:30 reservations on a saturday night and were promptly seated when we arrived. the restaurant looked pretty busy but our server (david) was very attentive to all our needs throughout the evening. \n\nthe meal started off with a few cocktails, a great wine suggestion from our server, and a delicious assortment of breads and butters. i'd highly recommend the <mark>New York Steak Hash with Black Garlic Blue Cheese Butter</mark>. for appetizers the wife got the ahi tuna and i enjoyed the lobster bisque. both were great choices. the bisque could have been a tad hotter but the flavor, seasoning, and amount of lobster were all phenomenal. the tuna was seared rare and was extremely tasty. \n\nfor our meals i had the surf and turf with mashed potatoes. everything was cooked perfectly and tasted better than i could have imagined. you can't go wrong with their fillet or their lobster, but together it's to die for.  i'd highly recommend this dish. the wife also had a fillet with a side of mash and was raving about it the whole meal. \n\nby the end of our entrees, we were way too stuffed to even attempt a dessert but we saw plenty of desserts come out of the kitchen that looked amazing. the table next to us was only there for dessert and it looked like they ordered every one on the menu. we heard lots of oooo's and ahhhhh's! \n\noverall, we give this restaurant a 4.5 with the only deduction for the price of a jack + coke ($11). if i'm drinking an $11 jack + coke, it better be a stiff drink :-)", 
            "i made a reservation for a wednesday here to celebrate my wife and i first anniversary. going through those not so obvious passageways and blistering fast elevators to get to the restaurant felt very special indeed. i'm gonna repeat what mostly everyone's been saying and that is the view is spectacular. a great view of las vegas rotating at about an hour for one full rotation (per my wife's observation). the food was great. we got the prie fixed menu ($90 per person for 4 courses) bc everything else seemed to be around 30-50 bucks a plate. for our first course my wife and i got a salad and the lobster bisque. the salad was salad but the lobster bisque was delicious . that was probably the best soup i've tasted here in vegas. it was creamy yet light and i like that they put some lobster meat in the middle of the bowl. our second course was a single saut\\u00e9ed scallop with a corn and butter sauce. the scallop was perfectly cooked and you can't go wrong <mark>New York Steak Hash with Black Garlic Blue Cheese Butter</mark> and seafood. our main courses were salmon with prawns and a filet mignon with haricovert (pronounced ha-ri-co-vare), roasted cipollini onion, and some kind of red wine/butter sauce. again, everything tasted great and my wife ate everything. our dessert was some kind of chocolate pudding with a small floral bowl made of white chocolate that carried some fruit and whipped cream. i would say the only misses about this place is that for dinner time it is pretty dark inside so looking at the menu can be a little hard and the dessert wasn't that special. everything else though was superb and i would recommended this place for any anniversary or special occasion. my wife told me she would come back here for lunch and i agreed as prices are little bit lower. overall, i think this restaurant is \"close to the top\" on my top resto list bc of the ambience and the attentive service."

            "top of the world, you took my breath away when were getting seated to our table.  \n\ni took my bf here the other night to celebrate his birthday and we both had a great time.  the service and view was amazing!!!  we both ordered the four course meal which consist <mark>Choice of Soup or Salad</mark>, appetizer, meal and dessert.  it also came with 3 types of bread and three types of butter to go with it.  i highly recommend spreading the pesto butter....yummy!!!  \n\ni was surprised that they read my reservations in detail.  i booked our reservations through open table and asked them to sing happy birthday to my bf towards the end of the night and they did.  \n\ndefintely a good date night place :-)", 
            "the stratosphere is located at the very end of the strip and right before the iffy area of vegas. i personally like the stratosphere and have stayed here a few times on business trips. after a very long, hard day at a convention, my colleague and i decided to treat ourselves to a nice dinner at the top of the world restaurant. \n\nas we rode up the elevator, with our ears popping on the way up, i became a bit anxious as i'm actually afraid of heights. i gingerly stepped out of the elevator with caution as i did not know what to expect. we found a large restaurant that spins!!!! slowly, of course, but the restaurant is rotating as you eat so you get a full view of las vegas, henderson and other nearby towns. we were there at night, so we got to really see all of vegas lit up and let me tell you that was an absolute treat for the eye. vegas is truly beautiful. you don't see the drunks stumbling the streets or the depressed people who just lost their entire life savings from up here. all you see is the beauty that makes up this awesome city. you can truly appreciate the architecture and design of lv from top of the world restaurant. \n\nif i remember correctly, we both chose the four course tasting menu which included a <mark>Choice of Soup or Salad</mark>, a small appetizer, a steak and dessert. now, it's been a while since i was here, so i'm guessing it's changed a little but i did peek at their current menu and they still offer this option for $90 per person. now, let me take this opportunity to tell you that the food was very good, but it is overpriced. you are paying for the atmosphere and the view, for sure! the service was slightly above average but not to the level i would have expected for the amount of money you spend when dining here.\n\nthe meal was well paced and allowed you to view the complete 360-degrees of scenery and more if you took your time during dessert. \n\ni would say it's worth a visit...if someone else is paying!", 
            "what a view!  not only is the food great, but honestly the view is worth its weight in gold!  we had 4:00pm reservations for our first night in las vegas and while it wasn't busy, its better to be safe than sorry.  yes, it is a little early for dinner but this was a great time as we were able to enjoy the beautiful sunset and watch the city go from day to night.  be sure to ask for a window seat!  \n\nthe waitress, dalia, was very nice and attentive.  we were served a bountiful bread basket with 3 different infused butter options - highly recommend the honey ginger one!  we both ordered filets (no soups <mark>Choice of Soup or Salad</mark> - saving room for our anticipated meal!)  we were told that the sides are bigger but not really \"shareable\" so we ordered our own - i got the butternut risotto and my husband ordered the baked potato.  fyi - these are definitely shareable!  everything was delicious and prepared well -although the presentation was a little lacking (steak on the plate with 2 cooked carrots). \n\nthey have a photographer who goes around and will take photos of you - of course they charge for the photos but this a great chance to get some really nice mementos of a great date night!  after dinner, be sure to go to the observation deck and take a look around!  again, what a view!", 
            "if you're looking for a good deal, look elsewhere. but if you're willing to splurge a bit, you'll be rewarded with more than just a dinner, but an entire experience. the top of the world is located around the 106th floor of the stratosphere hotel and has a rotating dining room giving you fantastic views of all of las vegas. the menu gives you a few different choices but is largely overpriced. however, the $90 tasting option is the best way to go. you start off with <mark>Choice of Soup or Salad</mark> and then proceed through three other courses, including a peppered salmon and delicious desserts. although i don't usually like to spend big on dinners in vegas, i recommend giving this place a try just once. and definitely get the wine pairings for only a little bit more!", 
            "had a great time, my sister and i went there for lunch, we had so much fun, the food was  not bad i got the short ribs burger, it actually was good but don't get the fries instead ask f<mark>Choice of Soup or Salad</mark> i didn't like that fries at all, but the view was gorgeous we took lots of pictures, staff very pleasant :)"

            "we went to dinner at the stratosphere with our two teenagers. as you can see from any photo on the place, the views are unbelieveable and the rotating experience, especially at sunset, are unparalleled. so, it would be easy for the strat to rely on its iconic views of las vegas and neglect the food and service. surprisingly, both the food and the service are superb.  our waiter, max, was a true dining professional and guided us seamlessly through the experience in ways we didn't even realize we needing guiding. for example, he told us when to expect the \"sky jumpers\" to appear before us, how to prepare our camera for the best photo and more. he seemed to be working with an experienced serving team that anticipated our every need.\n\ni got the tasting menu <mark>Surf & Turf with Petite Filet</mark> mignon and it was devine. daughter got the seafood pasta and is still talking about it. max even got my 15 year old french fries that were not on the menu and allowed him to share my filet with me.\n\nthe reason that this isn't 5 stars is not the stratosphere's fault. i hadn't realized how much i am afraid of heights until dining at the top of 106 floors. being this high up was actually very stressful and watching the sky fallers jump past our window every few minutes for the entire meal was kind of terrifying. when max told us we could go upstairs to the open air viewing platform as part of our meal, my husband and daughter eagerly went up to take in the views outdoors, while my son and i waited inside. so while the dinner and service were impeccable, i realize that sky top dining is probably not for me."

            "the atmosphere is absolutely amazing! the food on the other hand not so much.. we try the four course tasting menu for 90 bucks and we did the wine pairing for an extra 30. 1.salad was ok 2. scallops favored really well. 3. salmon i did not care for it. the pea guacamole was a little lumpy i like it a little smoother. 4. mini <mark>Dessert Duo</mark> (de creme and mixed berries) ok.....\nhe had the  1. lobster bisque 2. scallops 3. center cut steak (loved it) 4. mini <mark>Dessert Duo</mark>.\n\nnot sure if it was just us but he felt a little woozy once the room stopped rotating (after midnight i think) so we didn't go to the lounge. went downstairs to play a little.  and once we got in the cab both of us felt very dizzy. really weird because i never get motion sickness. \nif they change the menu/ chef i would love to try it again but if not i'll pass.", 
            "rotating restaurant on top of the tower at the stratosphere offers diners a nice view of vegas on a clear day. because it's located a bit off from the main part of the strip, not many people seem to drive here for a meal, but this restaurant is well deserving of it's stellar reviews. \n\nhighly recommend the 3 courses prix fixe menu for $45, available at lunch until around 3:30pm. the lobster bisque is tasty, as well as the soup of the day, which was a vegetable corn soup with fennel. for my entree of surf and turf, i chose the canadian lobster for the seafood. i absolutely loved the succulent lobster. the steak was tender too. the <mark>Dessert Duo</mark> was not as impressive. i think you might be able to upgrade to a different dessert for a small upgrade fee. \n\noverall, it was a memorable lunch, and you get to go to the observation level both indoor and outdoor before or after your meal. so you save around $20 on the observation fee on the tower. it was also enjoyable to watch people go on the adventurous rides they have. highly recommended! we will be coming back for sure!", 
            "simply amazing. my partner and i got married in vegas earlier that day, and we went to top of the world for our wedding-night dinner. the view was breathtaking, and we were given a romantic booth facing out. the hostess told us, with a wink, \"now those tablecloths go all the way to the floor!\" (!!) hah! sassy! \n\nlet's see, my wife had the four-course tasting menu - caesar salad, the scallops, i'm forgetting the third course (salmon?), and a tiny <mark>Dessert Duo</mark>. i had the surf & turf, and the lobster tail was to die for. the bread assortment & butter varieties were all so delicious, as well. i ate pretty much all of her dessert, and the pot de creme - delish.\n\nwe left stuffed and oh so happy. great service, great food, great view (we even saw sky jumpers leaping mid-meal!)."
